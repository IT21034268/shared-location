5,Excellent TIMEX watch!,I had the same Timex model before I purchased this one. The one that I had stopped working after replacing the battery. The watch had no problems but the jewelerer who made the battery replacement did not close it well and very soon sweat and water got inside the watch and the display got affected. Since I was so happy with the functions and ease of operation of this watch I decided to purchase this one again. My first watch lasted around 3 years. This watch has everything I need for my training sessions where I use the intervals a lot. Great value for the price.
3,Not made like they used to be...,"I've owned a few Ironman watches over the last 20 years. They used to go forever until they would eventually sink in the water or get lost. I purchased this one last year and it's been repaired once already and needs to go in again. That being said, when working, its a great watch."
5,love it,The numbers are large so I can tell time without putting on my reading glasses. And it wasn't hard to figure out how to set it.
4,Electronic Clay,"Amorphium allows its users to manipulate basic shapes (sphere, cone, cylinder, and others) and turn them into stunning 3D graphics. This program is the electronic equivalent to molding clay. It is very easy to learn and comes with tutorials that will help you learn the program and its functions. If you're looking for a fun modeling program to play around with, then pick up Amorphium."
1,What a complete piece of JUNK....,"This has to be the WORST design in the history of cell phone holders. I just can't figure out how someone got paid for a design that is horribly flawed. It dosent actually go around the phone, it has this bottom prong which if it was an eigth of an inch longer would go around the bottom of the phone and work amazingly. They however decided to make it just shy of going around phone which makes the prong place constant tension on the phone. Bad for two reasons... First, I don't like the idea of this strain being placed on the phone right at the seam of two pieces coming together (eventually it's gotta split the thing open, right?). Secondly, can you say projectile RAZR??? The pressure turns the phone into a missile just waiting to launch.In summation ""I don't get it"" and ""What the HELL???"" but, congrats again to the boy/girl genius who sold the company on the ""let's make it just a little shorter than the phone"" concept. Give em a raise."
1,Poor Design,"Will not securely hold your phone and will send it flying if bumped wrong, poor design you will risk harming you new Razor with this one..... I returned mine."
1,Piece of Junk!,"What's shown is a triangular shaped holder which is what I wanted and has worked great for me in the past. What I got was a four-cornered, poorly designed item that is going right back to Amazon. Don't waste your time on this until they get it right."
2,Great CD...Horrible Recording,"I agree that this is a remarkable cd in terms of the songs and style, but the recording is so bad that I can no longer listen to it. The recording is so grainy that it is painful to listen to, and at the same time, sounds as if it was recorded behind a curtain. This is simply the worst recorded cd I have ever heard. I have a very large cd collection and a pretty high end system so I don't believe my equipment is the culprit. Has anyone else experienced this problem?"
5,"FITS TEEN 5'3""","I struggled with buying a costume ""online"" for my 13 yr old son.He still enjoys the holidays and wanted to go trick or treating. Kids sizes were too small ... he is 5'3"" and weighs about 120 lbs. Even the Xtra large kids sizes would be too small. Adult sizes too large. This came with everything you see in the photo except the weapons and it FIT!!!!!! Is a decent costume for the price and I shopped around. More elaborate ones were great looking but the price nearly tripled!! In these economic times, it's enough of a strain to buy a costume at all, much less spend upwards of $60.00 for one. So this one was perfect. It is unfortunate that they appear "" out of stock"" now. I probably got one out of the last few.. It is a lightweight Nylon in fabric.. I would hand wash and line dry, if needed. A great little costume for a ""teen"". .. at a decent price. My son is happy with it!~ Mrs. Douglas Leach"
4,artful ways to use zesty ingredients,"Many books give good recipes but the best teach you how to use ingredients... and not that many effectively deal with the use of chili peppers. Flay's ideas work and many are easy to implement, such as chipolte or balsamic glaze --- then you can use them to garnish or fully spice the meal, depending on your taste"
5,Go Steelers!,"When pro football is in season, I like this reminder of my Steeler pride fluttering in the wind as I pull into the driveway."
2,Bring Back The Pits!,"Amazon had featured the Peloponnese Whole Kalamata Olives in the same type of tubs. These were delicious. Then they stopped having those in stock and only offered the pitted olives. Trust me, if you've tasted the whole olives, you won't be willing to eat these. Because the pits are removed, the olives soak up far, far more of the brine. Instead of a firm, meaty bite, you end up with most of the olives being shriveled and soft - like a fruit that has started to go bad. And, while no one expects olives to be low-sodium, the pitted ones soak up so much that some of them actually taste as though you placed a teaspoon of salt in your mouth. I think this brand has some of the highest quality and flavored olives - when you buy them whole. The pitted ones were such a disappointment I threw the remainder away. Please, Amazon, bring back the whole olives. Meanwhile, I have gone back to my supermarket as source."
4,"""must-have"" for Canon camera collectors","A very detailed description of the early Canon camera history (""Leica copies"") with technical details, dates and pictures of each model. Probably the best research work ever can be expected from a private author. A little less on lenses: some pictures, reports but not detailed. Nice to read."
5,Love these snack cups.,"I have been using my first set of these cups for 9 years, so they are incredibly durable- no worries there. They go through the dishwasher just fine. One of my lids cracked a year ago (after 8 years of use!), but I kept on using it without any trouble.I tried the Take-n-Toss because they were cheap and the red store didn't carry these Sassy ones. The toss ones don't work for us because my toddler can't get his hand in the opening (and knows better than to turn it upside down and poor it out- goes everywhere!), and I have trouble getting the lids off.So, I'm coming back for more of these. I only wish there was one large and two medium in the set. I hardly ever use the small one which has the lid that doesn't open. I am ordering another set for my younger kids. These have been great with my kids from 1 to 5 years. I still use them with my 5-year-old in the car."
5,An excelent resource for those with scrupulosity OCD,Ciarrocci has a backround in both religion and mental health and brings to this book the benifit of both perspectives. This self help book is well worth reading for those who have OCD especially scrupulosity OCD. It explains the cognitive behavioral treatment of this type of problem.
4,Curtis Stigers revisited,I was listening to his first two CDs - Curtis Stigers and Curtis Stigers Time Was and I have always loved them so I thought I'd try some of his newer CDs. I liked them a lot and they have a lot more jazz content than the original CDs. I like his whiskey voice. You can picture him playing in the clubs. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who's a jazz fan.
5,An excellent book.,"I gave this book to my daughter, who had already done well on her SAT's, so it sat on her desk until the night before the test. At my urging, she agreed to go through the sample math problems that evening. Her math score went up almost 10 percent, from two hours of work. Imagine what would have happened if she had really studied. But she was happy since it put her over the 1400 mark. I highly recommend this book - it is well organized, clearly written, and contains some excellent test taking strategies. Thank you!"
2,Overrated....,"Don't be fooled by all the good reviews.... The princeton or barron SAT books (which I own by the way) are waaaayyy better than this one (and half the price!!!). The organization of the book makes it really hard to concentrate, and the strategies were time-consuming yet not very productive. I really really regret spending my money on this book."
5,Beautiful,A beautifully made movie with a beautiful message. Love it. And recommend it for anyone who still believes in the beauty of humanities.
5,excellant,"this is a wonderful movie, just wonderful. it does send a strong message, but I think it doesn't get too preachy. given the state of the world today, it is good to remember that many of those who pick up a gun and fight in wars do it for a number of reasons. no man is a complete monster, and the job is thankless and sickening most days.i felt a great deal of compassion for the average guys in this film that were fighting for the arrogant politicians and rulers of their time. it's a shame the ""royalty"" didn't leave their parties and mansions and pick up a gun. how little that has changed today.this film is well worth watching. it has tremendous heart, and bravo to those that made it. i don't agree with everything that has come out of europe lately, but sometimes something rare and special gets through.add this movie to your collection. if you have family members that are in the military, see it. there's a wonderful message here. it certainly fits with the christmas season."
4,"""Joyeux Noel"" - not your average Christmas story","This is a very intriguing film. The camaraderie between the troops during the holiday season is inspiring. Despite the realism of war, the movie focuses on more individual emotions.The point of the movie is very relevant to the grand scheme of life and a universal theme. It is interesting that each character speaks his/her own language and that everybody can understand one another. The movie nicely promotes diversity and acceptance. It is ironic that people fighting a war could come together so nicely. Even in a war situation, people are people and the basic needs for compassion are still there. This movie celebrates the similarities of cultures instead of their differences. I recommend this film to those seeking a good story line and an accurate historical background."
5,Joyeux Noel,"It is an outstanding movie about the spontaneous Christmas truce that occurred at many places on the Western Front during World War I in 1914. It is spoken three languages (French, German, English) and has English subtitles where necessary. The movie covers only one small part of the front but is extremely moving. This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen."
5,This one is worth purchasing,Excellent movie! This is a true story that pulled on my heartstrings. The DVD should be required viewing for all high school History students.
1,No English subtitles for Joyeux Noel with Unbox,"No English subtitles available on this movie through Unbox.Unless you understand French and German, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this movie through Unbox.Other reviews stating there are subtitles must be referring to the DVD, and not Unbox.Unfortunately, this fact is not stated in the product description. I had to wade through Amazon's help section to discover no subtitles are available with Unbox. I also discovered there are no refunds on digital products. Lose-lose. Buyer beware."
1,Der kleine Frieden im grosse Krieg,A very emotional movie. My personal connection to this tragic episode in our world history made this very difficult for me to watch. My grandfather fell on the German sideThus my special interest in this movie. The book was even more detailed!But I do recommend this movie !
1,Don't waste your money,"I almost bought this at the store but I pulled it out of the bag first to look at it and ~ick~ the fabric is rough! It's not 100 percent cotton it's 50/50 polycotton, and thin. Worst of all, the pattern was improperly screen printed on it so the princesses were all blurry. You'd be better off buying a plain pink all cotton set and ironing on the princesses or whatever else you want."
4,GREAT Brown Rice!,"I have been using my Zojirushi NS-ZCC18 Ten-Cup Rice Cooker now for more than a year and it has produced perfect brown rice every time. I most often make two cups, but I have used the machine for a single cup and for four cups--all turned out tender and cooked throughout with NO crispy parts.I would have given this cooker a full five stars but, although my wife and I have been VERY careful to use the supplied nylon spatulas, the non-stick pan has several scratches in various spots on the bottom. I don't like the idea that we may have ingested even small amounts of that non-stick material."
1,Skip this product,"After less than a year of everday usage, the locking mechanism became loose which made the rice turn out dry every time. The ""keep warm"" setting became useless because the longer the rice was in the cooker, the drier the rice became. What a waste!"
5,It's a fighting video game people!,"Okay, people are complaining about it being hard...if you haven't noticed the really good fighting games aren't a piece of cake. It's suppost to be challanging! Don't like then stop buying fighting games. I loved it, I am a major tekken and soul calbiur fan and I found no fauls in it.It kept me interested and all my favorite characters are back. This game is for major fighting game fans only, people who are hard core about tekken and all that other good stuff. If you didn't like tekken or the last two soul caliburs then don't buy it. You will find yourself cursing at the game system, trust me."
4,Somewhat disappointed,"This bowl was what I needed however, it is not ""clear"". It has a brownish tint to it and doesn't match the rest of the pieces that I have. It works great, I'll give it that, but I really wish that it was ""clear"" and not a brownish color."
3,doesn't fit my accessories,"I was happy that it fit well however when I tried to use my grating attachment, it did not work. The bowl is too short and this certainly limits my full usage of the bowl. I have a great set of accessories and therefore will have to find a taller bowl."
4,Great Training tool,This was very informative--especially for someone just starting out. I would recommend it to anyone interested in getting started with Triathloning.
3,"Just a diary, nothing more.","This is just a diary, not a training program. For the price was expecting more substance. Just too light for a solid recommendation to others. However, if you are just looking for a notebook/diary that may guide your workout notes, this is your book."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE!!!,"Here they go again.. damn record company sponges/leeches.. Hey, if you're reading this, here's an idea for an Aerosmith re-re-re-release.. Re-do PUMP and rename it MILK IT, cos that's just what you're doing!"
2,incorrrect facts,i bought this product mainly because said made in Italy guess what its made in china big surprise get your facts straight Amazon !
2,Almost got it right.,"For the most part, it's a good product, but the machined metal corkscrew doesn't work anywhere near as well as the spiral-bent wire corkscrew. The machined metal doesn't penetrate the cork; it tries to drill a hole. Wire versions penetrate the cork much better. The arms and everything else seem up to par. If they could swap that part, it would be a good product."
4,LL STILL HARD AS HELL,"THIS ALBUM IS HARD HITTING, LYRICS ARE SMOOTHLY CONVEYED, AND OVERALL IS SIMPLY DOPE. IF YOU EVER HAVE A RUN IN WITH MIKE TYSON (AND HAVE TIME TO THROW IN A CD FIRST) HOOK UP ""I'M BAD"". THIS SONG IS FILLED WITH ADRENALIN AND WILL NO DOUBT GET ANYONE WITH A PULSE HYPED. THE WHOLE ALBUM IS STRONG, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LL MAKING HIS USUAL SONGS THAT ARE GEARED TOWARDS HIS FANS IN HIGH HEELS. DESPITE THIS, THIS ALBUM IS STILL A CLASSIC THAT ANY TRUE HIP HOP FAN NEEDS TO OWN. BY THE WAY... L.L. vs KOOL MOE DEE? I THINK THAT'S A TOUGH CALL TO MAKE"
4,Creek Wars but less Red Eagle,"The Author starts by explaining how little is known about Red Eagle (or William Weatherford). Given that, I wonder why he starts the title with his name. The book has more information about Jackson and the other U.S. soldiers than about Red Eagle. But it does include detailed information about the battles (from the white man's point of view) and is easy reading, not in the style of other 19th Century books I have tried."
5,"YOU PROBABLY CAN'T HANDLE THIS ALBUM, Proceed with caution!","Redman is painfully underrated. Once his first album came out he should have gone platinum. But even he knows, his stuff is just for the streets; just like every track on the album. His dark melodies prove the album is titled correctly and his lyrics bounce from his throat to his nasal cavity, telling the world that he means what he says. Reggie Noble gives straight raw energy, not even the beat can sugar coat his lyrics, or hold him back. (Not unlike Raekwon's, RAW, DIRTY MCNASTY energy)Redman represents only himself, not caring what others are going to say. Completely in the zone. Tracks compare to no one from this world. His mind state is beyond normal comprehension.The perfect album if you want to blow your mind!!! I've had it for five years and still feel like I'm entering another realm when I listen to it. Straight up artistry. Only the best can do that. ""YO RED, Whadditlooklike.""ETERNAL"
2,"Hard plastic becomes brittle through ordinary use, then breaks","You're probably here because the the safety mechanism broke off through ordinary care, the same thing that happened to me for this part and the bowl that accompanied my Cuisinart less than a year ago. Surely a materials or design flaw that helps Cuisinart's bottom line."
5,This IS real country music,"Alan Jackson is the real deal. He is far closer in spirit to singers like George Jones than to the singers of his own generation. This is a collection of fabulous songs sung by an extremely talented singer with real country roots. I do so hope he does the sequel he mentions in the sleeve notes. And soon please. The Blues Man is simply breathtaking and there isn't one track I don't like. This is how real country music should sound. Are you listening Garth, Tim, et al?"
5,Alan Jackson still at his best,"Classic country. From the heart - to the heart. I have now completed by 10 CDs Alan Jackson collection - and still, I have not found ONE single on all his releases that I didn't LOVE right from the start. He's GOD.Can't wait for his upcoming 11th CD. ;-)"
2,Does not meet my High expectations of Alan Jackson,I enjoy a lot of what Alan has done. I enjoy modern and older country music. Despite a few good songs tracks the complete CD leaves a bit to be desired. Do buy this CD if to continue a collection of some type. Do not buy this CD if you are looking for the best of Alan nor if you want a history of country music.
2,This book is dated,This book was perhaps important 30 years ago. So much has happened in Rasch modeling and IRT since then that it only is of interest to those who want to study the history of the Rasch models.
3,A doctor gives a woman strength to make a difficult choice,"In Dwando, which literally means ""conflict"" in Bangla, a woman is torn between two choices. The film revolves around Sudipta (Ananya Chatterjee) who faces a serious ethical dilemma. She is torn between two choices, each with vast and cascading repercussions affecting the lives of several people. In this situation, a neurosurgeon Dr Ashoke Mukherjee (Soumitra) becomes crucially involved in her life. Her dilemma is ultimately resolved through the intervention of Dr Mukherjee who subtly maneuvers Sudipta's thought process and guides her to a choice, saving an innocent life in the process."
5,An absolute Must,This is a great chamber drama movie. I had watched Dwando at a film festival. A great collector's item.
4,Could have been longer!,"This is a great CD if you are a fan of KoRn or, if you just like spending money for no reason (I spent 99 cents, when I purchased Untouchables). There is one song I wish they would have included on there: The ""Freak on a Leash"" remix which was on the ""No Boundaries"" compilation for the Kosovo refugees (How many of you remember that?!) or included the MTV ""edited"" version of ""Freak"" or ""Blind"" for all you hardcore KoRn fans! Buy this CD, if you want some songs that are already on the other CDs (with the exceptions of the remixes) except ""Jingle Balls"" (which should be on a Kevin and Bean (KROQ) X-mas CD if it's not already on one of the previous ones."
2,Only reccomended for hardcore Korn Kollectors,"This is really a weak cd. Starts off with ADIDAS radio mix, but it isn't even a mix, it's an edited version. Good God, Dub Pistols remix sucks, it's 7 minutes, with boring repetative vocals, and screaming noises. The Got the Life mix is the reason this album gets the extra star, easily the best track on here. Twistchi is boring, and Jingle Balls is really kinda disturbing.Also i really don't think this cd earned it's explicit rating. Only one song is explicit (DPR)"
4,Works for me...why so rare?,"I was surprised when I couldn't find anything like this at my local office supply stores, and had to order it (and pay shipping) from Amazon. Anyway, it has served me very well over the past year. I like the size, and the look and feel, and the durability is pretty good considering how much I use it. It is starting to peel apart on the INSIDE of the binding, but otherwise it's holding up well. The small amount of peeling is not sticky and does not interfere in my work in any way."
5,Very comprehensive and complete coverage of Javascript!,The Javascript Bible is very comprehensive and well organized. It is designed as both a learning & reference tool. I recommend that anyone new to javascript first read this book and then pick up Orielly's book on Javascript. This is an excellent first choice!
1,a waste of time and money,"This is the second JavaScript book that I've tried and it looks like I will be moving on to a third.The author's explanations are very confusing and I had to read many passages repeatedly to grasp their meaning. He also doesn't explain the logic behind the scripting language-which is essential to understand if you want to create your own scirpts. Most importantly of all-THE EXAMPLES IN THE BOOK DON""T WORK! I wanted to do a rollover script for my site and wound up having to steal and modify someone else's. I would not recommend this book."
2,"Started Off Great, Downhill From There......","Javascript Bible is a huge paradox, and a huge disappointment. I'm the typical purchaser of the book--HTML-literate looking to learn Javascript. It came highly recommended, so I immediately purchased it. In retrospect, I should have bought Javascript Sourcebook instead--I learned HTML with that superb ""Sourcebook"" series, and i should have stuck with it. The Javascript Bible starts off promising for the beginner, and introduces JS well. But it then jumps into hundreds of objects and functions and doesnt explain their context and placement. I was lost. Another reviewer here said you'll get lost after Chap4--boy, is he ever right! After Chap4, the inexperienced JS programmer will be absolutely befuddled and clueless. To its credit, the book offers lots of code examples; but it doesn't explain how and why the code was written. I'm very disappointed. In short, if you've never programmed in JS before, this book won't teach you. No way."
3,good book..but not for absolute amateurs,"this book is covered topic by topic very well but the examples and some of the exercises in the tutorial are of advanced nature.ideal for someone with some programming knowledge ,but if u are a newcomer to programming world- need some supplementary javascript books when it comes to scripts and examples ( otherwise u really break ur head.)"
3,Javascript Bible,"This book is great reference. Not great to learn with. It has pulled me out of some tight situations. My biggest complaint with it is it is not good at touching the JScript language of Microsoft. Understanding of course that it is a Javascript book, however as a developer I really find myself looking for books that can give the information needed for both IE as well as Netscape. This book does not."
4,Great Debut,"A lighthearted teenager with swagger and some bragadoccio sprinkled in steps on the scene and delivers a strong album. LL was 16 years old at the time. Compared to the current young rappers in that age group, not only is his album very complex, but it trumps a lot of the stuff being put out now. This album is a very solid effort, and after listening to what's on the airwaves right now, this album has an effect comparable to when you open up a window to a room with stagnant air. Not only do you feel refreshed, but you regain some of the brain cells that you lost when you turned on todays radio.All rap fans should do themselves a favor and put this one in their cd players every once in a while. It'll renew your spirits and help you remember why you loved hip hop in the first place."
4,This record was the blueprint for all solo MC's to follow.,"Hip-hop fans occasionally forget that LL Cool J was the model for the solo MC, and this record is why. ""Radio"" and ""Rock the Bells"" are classics."
2,Yow to Open your Own Restaurant...A Loser of a Guide,"This is a very skinny book written by two men who obviously have restaurant experience, but who have very poor writing/communications skills. This book is not a guide to setting up the spreadsheets necessary to open a restaurant. It is doubtful that the authors even know how to open up Lotus or Excel. The amount of essential items left out are humongous. Watch yourself! Not a recommendable expenditure of any money whatsoever on this crummy attempt at producing a useful ""book"". Rating: eight onions."
2,Poor Handle Design,"Retractable handle not attached to the bag very well. Looks like it will break easily. The rest of the bag is well designed, fits two 17in laptops perfect."
5,AWESOME,"I met Three Days Grace and they rocked, so I feel that their cd kicks just as much ass as they do live. BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!"
5,best. cd. ever.,"I should call Three Days Grace's cd Mohhamed Ali cuz its the greatest. this cd is so awesome its crazy. i loved i hate everything about you and bought the cd. thats not even the best song! ""just like you"" and ""overrated"" are both some of the most awesome songs Ive ever heard, and the rest of the songs are all equally good. great lyrics, great vocals, great guitars, great drumming, great cd. buy this cd now... you wont regret"
4,Strong Debut,"Three Days Grace's self-titled debut is their greatest work. In its time, it made something different out of grunge and nu-metal, and made a whole different genre. My favorite songs off the album are: Burn, Just Like You, Home, I Hate Everything About You, Let You Down, Born Like This, Wake Up, Take Me Under, Now or Never, and Drown. Go ahead and pick it up for yourself and see what I mean.Rating: 4 stars/5 stars"
4,One Of My Favorites****,"Well what can I say.This is a great cd.This is a great band.Very powerfull words spoken throughout the entire album.When i first got it,I would skip a few songs here and there. but,now that I've listened to a million times..I don't feel the need to skip.Bottom line if you don't think this is great cd.Then there is something wrong with you."
4,Awesome Band,"In my opinion, 3DG are amazingly talented. I've seen them twice live and they put on a great show. THe vocals are amazing and the band is never off. I reccomend everyone go out and get their cd. I can't wait for their second one to come out because it's going to be even awesomer.and to the people that don't like 3dg..no need to trash talk them..you can have an opinion but you shouldn't bring down the band..they are a bunch of talented guys that have worked hard to get where they are now."
2,Did not like it,"I did not like this CD at all. The rock is too pop based, and has a ""mushy"" feeling, and it's very boring. Nothing interesting. The only decent song worth a second listen is ""I Hate Everything About You"". Everything is pretty boring and/or generic. I'd rather get an Evanescence, Seether, or a White Stripes CD than Three Days Grace."
2,It all sounds the same,"I bought this Cd because it was 13.99 and I really like the song ""I Hate Everything About You"". I listened to it a few times, and it was really hard to get through. Most of the songs sound similar, and they have the same structure, very pretictable. I do however like the songs ""Home"" and ""Just Like You"""
2,Do you hear what I hear?,"Wow, this band definitely did not stand up to my expectations. Besides the fact that they sound like all the other hard rock bands currently in the mainstream, they also lack any kind of X factor. The first, and only, time I listened to them, I felt like I was in a low budget horror movie from the mid 90's with a sadly unhopeful soundtrack. If you want excellent Canadian talent, check out Our Lady Peace, especially their older stuff. You can lend your ear to Three Days Grace if you choose, but you'd be better off wasting your time sitting on the toilet. Because, with Three Days Grace, it's just like constipation: you sit there waiting for something great to pop out, but you just end up with some regular old crap."
4,Great Debut Album,"This album shocked me I bought due to a friend send it will be the best rock album of the year and so far their isn't much competition. I love the songs ""Burn"",""Just Like You"", and ""I hate everything about you"" Those are the singles and great songs on the album. But the other stand out songs on the album include ""Scared"", ""Home"", and ""Born Like This"""
5,3DG CD,"I just wanna say to all you ppl who dont know who 3DG are, go find somebody who does and listen to them! and if you like them(which im sure you will), go out and buy their cd! they're the best ever and my #1 favortie band. i can relate to pretty much all their songs and there isnt one i dont like! i havent stopped listening to the cd since i bought it.adam has an awesome voice and they all have wicked skills.....YOU RAWK 3DG!!"
5,cant wait for their next one,"when i first heard ""i hate everything about you"" on the radio, i loved it but had no idea who three days grace was. i thought they were probably just another wannabe band that wouldnt last very long. but then they started playing ""just like you"" on the radio and i knew that i was wrong. the singing is really good and the lyrics are also great. the guitars sound different but thats really not bad at all. all the songs are really catchy and ive gotten many of them stuck in my head for days at a time. other than the three singles, the two i mentioned above and ""home"", the songs ""scared"" ""wake up"" and ""born like this"" are great and my favorites but all of the songs are really good. if you like pretty much any kind of rock, you might want to give this a listen. i am a big fan of metal and i loved it."
3,hard to rate; maybe a 2.75,"Pretty good all around sound, some of the songs are pretty good, but they aren't ones that you'll want to listen to over and over again. My personal fave was I Hate Everything About You. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID BY WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THE VERSION WITH THE BONUS DVD. The live performances are weak, their songs transfer horribly to acoustic, and the bonus song is unremarkable. The CD itself is okay, but the dvd sucks."
1,CHORUS_CHORUS_CHORUS,"Alright when i heard this band for the first time with there first single ""i hate everything about you"" ya i thought they were goods so i purcahsed there cd. Now i wish i oculd have my 14.99 back becasue i knew every word to there songs by reading the song names. Every song just repeats the chorus in my mind this is a very poor cd and horrible lyrics i am telling whoever is interested in this cd DO NOT BUY."
3,Sky Raiders,I saw this serial when I was a kid! I love watchinbg all these serials again and comparing themto the hi tech stuff from today.
5,The best hair dryer,I bought one of these dryers about 12 years ago and just now had to replace. Very good quality!
1,poor construction,"I have used Conair for many years including 20 years as a professional stylist. I have not worked doing hair for may years -but when I needed to get a new dryer for my personal use at home I bought a blackbird. Mistake! The wiring burned up within 3 months with only 5 minutes a day of use. When I called Conair to see what could be done, they made the process sooooooo difficult that no one will actually do it. So they got my money but they will not get it again. I hope no one else will purchase Conair products either!"
1,What is this?,"This stuff is terrible. It reminded me of the first cologne I bought when I was a kid. Think of the worse cologne you have ever smelt, and then add Old Spice and Brute, shake it up and then add some rubbing alcohol. Wala! Raw Vanilla. I immediately, repackaged it and sent it back, and gladly paid the shipping to get it out of my house."
4,"Mary, Queen of Scots: Queen Without a Country","Although she is living in France, Mary, Queen of Scots, is extremely patriotic towards Scotland and longs to return to the country of her birth. Her four best friends and ladies-in-waiting, all named Mary, are all as passionately Scottish as she is.This book is the story of Mary's life at the French court. She reflects on her impending marriage to the French Dauphin (crown prince) Francis, who is one of her best friends. However, Mary despises his mother, Queen Catherine de Medici, and Catherine's henchmen. She admires the French king, Henry II, and his mistress, Diane de Poitiers (somewhat excessively). The book is entertaining, and the characters are lively and realistic (but sometimes one-dimensional, like Diane de Poitiers and Catherine de Medici)."
2,Disappointing,"I had read one or two of his short stories previously and liked them immensely, but this was generally way too long and self-interested. It had it moments though."
4,Typically fine Leiber,"The Wanderer won a Hugo award for best novel. Although somewhat dated, it still stands the test of time. Leiber has worked a number of his favorite themes into this work, including the horror evoked in people trapped in life threatening events they are helpless to control, and the actions and reactions of people once these events are put in train. Like many of his works, The Wanderer emphasizes psychological and cultural issues far more than the scientific and melodramatic. This puts the novel head and shoulders above most end-of-the-world works. It demands the reader participate in the events, to understand or at least accept actions which seem repugnant outside the demands placed on the characters from the simple parameters set up in the story's framework.Overall, worth reading."
1,Not real helpful,"I thought this book would have more detailed information about the sites. i didn't expect 'x marks the spot', but I could only find 1 of the 22 sites I checked out in Florida and Alabama. This wasn't just private land spots I couldn't find, but bridge access points and road cuts. I would skip this one. Use the money for your local club dues."
1,"""Yuck!"" said my kids","No matter what recipes I've tried with stevia -- my own or one from this book -- they've all been basically inedible. I'm extremely sensitive to sugar (read: my tongue swells up and cracks when I eat too much of it!) so I was longing for stevia to be an answer to my sweet-tooth. I tried the chocolate chip cookie recipe from this book, and despite the fact that it uses regular (sugar-filled) chocolate chips, my kids both said ""Yuck"" and refused to eat them. So did I. They ended up in the trash."
2,Recipes not very good,I have tried several recipes in this book and I am not sure if my dog would even eat them. The egg nog was most disgusting. I couldn't bear the smell never mind the thought of drinking the very thick eggy mixture. The rice pudding was more like rice with cinnamon on it. Yuck.
3,PRETTY but VERY Hard to Open!,"This box is very pretty but is extremely hard to open, especially for a three year old! It makes my little one frustrated because you really have to push hard to get the top to flip open. She loves it, though, because it plays music and she can put her little figurine dolls inside."
1,worthless grass cutting,I've had this edger over two years and it has never done a decent job of trimming. The blade speed is so low it won't cut 80% of the grass. The engine runs at too slow a speed and doesn't speed-up or have a throttle cable.
2,It was good while it lasted,"When I first got it, I was excited because the sound was great. I was using it to supplement the small stereo I had in my room. My wife took it for a jog. It worked great during the jog. The next time I tried to play a CD on it, did not work any more. Total amount of days with it... 4 days. It would not recognize as having a CD in it and it would not start. I am not sure if I would buy another from this company, I am thinking in buying something that would last more than a few days."
3,10 yr. old Spongebob Fan,"I dropped it once from the couch to the carpet, and it won't dance anymore. It was fun, but not durable enough for kids."
3,Not bad.... Not Great either,"I have only had this hose for 3 months, and It works, although leakage occurs alot, and I find that this hose cinks easily. It does a nice job recoiling, but it is hard to use because of all of the cinking and leakage. Would not purchase again."
1,"nice hose, bad connections","The very low quality metal fittings on the ends fail after just one season. The end split out at the root of the threads where the nozzle would attach.Otherwise this hose was nice when it functioned. For the price, it's not too much to ask for machined brass fittings on the end. At the very high price this is sold for, it's a rip-off."
4,An overlooked gem,"I've listened to quite a few Slade albums (not all), and no one came close to ""In Flame""! If anybody possessis it and thinks it is topped by another work of Slade, I'd truly like to know. The energy, but also some tunes (eg. Far far away, How does it feel) are just amazing. I'd name this album in one sentence with other great straightforward, fast, vocally dominated rock performances by eg. Steppenwolf, Creedance Clearwater Rivival, even the Beatles in a rocky mood."
2,Universal????,Fittings are all wrong for my 2650psi washer. They are plastic.. like for a garden hose or maybe small electric washer? Wastse of my $$$
2,Huffy Venice Recumbent Comfort Bike,The Bike came in a very battered box. The derailluer was a nightmare. Parts were missing. It should have been a straight forward job. It ended up in the bike store to be assembled. Last time I purchase a bike from this source.
4,better value out of XM subscription,"This kit allowed me to use my XM radio in two cars my wife drives, moving it back and forth from car to car, allowing us to get better value out of our XM subscription. Easy to install, works well. Good value"
2,Beautiful doll BAD hair,This doll and accessories are overall GREAT but she also has that petroleum hair which is a cheap fiber mattel toys is giving Barbie and her friends.This dolls face is very lovely and her dress is very elegant.But reroot her hair with Katsilk.
4,Fashion Fever Doll,This doll is very pretty. I love her dark skin and her wild hair. Her outfit is nice too. A very nice doll to give to a child to play with or to keep as a collectors item.The doll also comes with some great items for a child to use for herself.This would be a great gift for a Barbie doll fan.
2,Expected more.,"My expectations were much too high for this product, based on other V-Smile products as well as Baby Einstein. We purchased this for our 2 yr old daughter. She's entertained by it, so I guess it somewhat meets our needs. The graphics are pixely, not clear...even the names for the objects/animals do not sound correct, e.i. ""Tiger"" sounds pronounced ""Tiga"". I'm still contemplating whether or not we should take the console back for a different product."
2,"Nope, not this one...","My 6 yo son has a VSmile for big kids, so, well, we bought a VSmile Baby for and an additional cartridge - no problems. My 16 months old daughter has no interest in it al all. The voices are very soft, and there is nothing to grab child's attention with, very plain colors and - believe it or not - it is very confusing to operate. Well, we did not spend too much time with the thing and now it is sitting on top of the bookshelf, and no one pays attention to it). Really-truly -a waste of money. She (my daughter) has a lot of fun with LeapFrog books, that were sent to my older son (6 yo) by his Grandma."
3,Doesn't even work! Very upset baby on my hands!,"I have a 12 month old who just received this toy for his birthday and I thought that it would be great for us to sit down with together and I would love to teach him baby sign language. That is why I liked this console better than the Leap Start version. I gave the ""toy"" part only three stars, the console itself doesn't work. The screen just plays the V.Smile intro over and over again and doesn't recognize the ""Smartridges"". If I can't get a working version, maybe I will go with the Leap Start version. This is not a good first impression of the product. He love the ""toy"" part of this, though."
2,System quit working after 3 months,"My daughter LOVED this system. She couldn't get enough of it. But 3 months after purchasing the system, it quit working. The remote part quit responding with the actual system. I called Vtech and although they are willing to fix or replace it, I have to pay for the shipping for it and they require you to also purchase shipping insurance. So it's going to end up costing me about $10 to have the system fixed when in my opinion, it shouln't have broken that quickly in the 1st place. To me the graphics weren't super great but good enough for babies and young toddlers."
4,Good enough for it's price,"We originally bought this for our son at a year old, but I think that's a bit too early really for a device like this. Now he is just over 2 years old, he will sit and play with it. I really can't understand the comments about poor graphics. They are perfectly fine for the purpose it is intended for and they certainly do not resemble those of an Atari 2600. That's just plain insulting to this product. What were people expecting? Playstation or Xbox quality graphics at this price point? My wife and I also kept wondering if we even had the same product as we haven't heard any mispronunciation of words either. Kids at this age treat them roughly and attention spans are limited anyway so I would rather spend $40 on this than some much more expensive device that would offer little more benefit for this age group. When he's old enough we'll get him a real computer with 'better graphics' but certainly not when he's 2 years old!"
1,Not worth it,"We bought this for our two year old daughter. The resolution is terrible, and the words are mispronounced. MY daughter loses interest very quickly in it, and much rather look at her books than the screen. I think it has a lot to do with the quality of the picture. I wouldn't buy this as a gift, even on sale at a great price. I'm hoping the new leapfrog baby/toddler product is better than this one. This was a very disappointing purchase."
4,Daughter is 'ok' with it,"I had originally bought the little leaps learning system and couldn't get it hooked up with the DVD player. When I returned that to the store I ran across the VSmile Baby. My daughter just turned a year and is entertained when I play it. I like the fact that it has the 'self play'. She will sit there pressing the buttons and listening to the noises and sounds it makes without it being hooked up. It's very convenient and I'm lookign forward to traveling with it while we return to the states. (Stationed overseas) I have not bought any of the cartridges yet, just have the demo."
4,Denon saved my family,"I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that my family was one of the millions affected by the current mortgage crisis. In retrospect, we probably should have known that eleven dollars for a new home in a sunny California subdivision was too good to be true, but that's a story for another day.With the money pop saved on the purchase of our home, he bought a set of these cables, and thank God he did. My little brother - who has been taking guitar lessons for almost eight months now - played one of his songs for the family on our home theater system after pop installed these cables, and the sound was so incredible that an executive for Sony/BMG sitting in an office 3000 miles away dropped everything and signed my little brother to a 65 million dollar, three album contract.Thanks Denon!"
2,Cabel no make smart,I wnt cable make me smart. Cabl no mak me smart. No work to make smrt. Pretty bleu. 2 star.
1,Waste of money its CAT5 handles digital not analogue,Hate to burst your bubble folks but the quality of this CAT5 cable doesn't improve your sound quality over standard CAT5. CAT5 caters for a digital signal not analogue which means that the quality provided on a $5 dollar cable is the same quality as this $500 dollar waste of money...Quality for digital signals is dependent upon the number of data bits the transmission medium can handle not the medium quality.Google analogue versus digital...
3,The really do work.,"My wife and I have been trying to conceive for almost a decade. We've tried every form of therapy, artificial insemination, and some other, more questionable methods. Then I saw this product. The Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable. I just KNEW that it was the answer to our prayers. When they arrived my wife gave me the look of a defeated woman with nothing but a feigned hope. But I had faith!That night we wrapped ourselves in the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable and tried one last time for a child. Nine months later our daughter was born. Thank you SO MUCH Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable.I'm only giving the product a 3-star rating, however. I was hoping for a true heir and I don't feel like buying a new cable."
3,Give it time...,"All of you skeptics out there have obviously overlooked the most important feature of all - the ""anti-aging properties""! YOU can buy $5 cables if you want to, but YOU'LL BE DEAD IN 100 YEARS! Meanwhile I, vitalized by my Denon AKDL1s (I think I'll buy 2, just in case), will be dancing on your graves 500 years from now. Unless I have something better to do.P. de Leon"
1,Product Restrictions,"I am highly disgusted with the shipping policy that has been placed on this cable. IF our troops in the middle east would have been properly equipped with these cables from the beginning, we would have located the WMD's and Bin Laden years ago.I am highly suspicious. Why would cables this good be restricted to locations in the US? The other rather strange detail is the length. The cable is 59 inches long, one inch short of five feet - does that make any sense at all? Plus, 59 is a prime number. The seventeenth prime number. Seventeen itself being the seventh prime, and further- seven is prime as well.And perhaps more importantly...why would they only be available in ""BLUE"". Think about it, people...there are only two things in the world that are both blue and exactly 59 inches apart."
1,Wait for the Limited Edition,"This cable is decent enough, but if you really want to blow your mind with audio nirvana and keep up with the Jones's, just wait for Denon to release the AKDL1 Limited Edition.The AKDL1LE features 24k gold wiring and connectors as well as a certificate of authenticity and an autograph from the designing engineer. The LE package doesn't stop there. They actually give you TWO AKDL1LE cables- one for actual use and one for display purposes (for the Denon AKDL1LE bullet-proof sealed glass case- sold separately).Denon hasn't announced a price or release date yet, but you can sign up for an auto-notification for a mere $99 and Denon will dispatch someone to knock on your door with a golden ticket as soon as one is available.I signed up for two and plan to make a killing on the scalping market..."
1,Please use common sense,"And don't be suckered by this nonsense. Digital signals are 1/0 on/off yes/no. If the signal makes it (which it will on any crappy wire) it's accurate and exactly what you need. If it doesn't, it will fail spectacularly and will be obvious (i.e., nothing comes out of the speaker/system) -- don't be a fool and pay 100x more than a set of 6 wires is worth."
1,"Customer service representatives unable to explain, remedy collision of leptons in my family room.","As excited as I was to open my new Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable, I was much more dissatisfied by Denon's customer service experience. Apparently the result of an improper connection and the cable's high data transfer speed, I mistakenly caused the collision of a pair of positrons (i.e. leptons) at several hundred GeV. While the resulting mini black hole theoretically proved the validity of superstring theory and may result in endless new perpetual energy sources, it also stained our Berber carpet. When I phoned Denon customer support, the representative I spoke with--whose English was horrible, by the way--was discourteous and unhelpful. Regardless of my data transfer or particle acceleration needs in the future, I will not be shopping with Denon again."
2,Savior or Pure Evil?,"This cord has post-dated any existing technology and soon this will be the cord that humans use to tilt the rotation of the earth back into its appropriate alignment after the government ""accidentally"" blows up the moon, which ironically was also caused by this cord. So take heed when buying this cord it can be used for good or evil. also on a side note its a pretty average cord."
1,Fixed my Time Machine,"I've been looking for this cable for several years and I finally found it here! Who would have thought that Amazon would carry the cable I needed to complete my vintage time machine. It's been inoperative since the flux capacitor malfunctioned and caught fire in the late 80's. But alas, I found the last cable I need right here. It's only the 1.2 version, so your jigawatt's may vary. Try playing the Beatles Revolution Number 9 with this cable and you'll be pleasantly surprised. But I did give it a 5 star rating for being dishwasher safe."
3,OMG!! DENON You Saved my Marriage!!,"I am speechless! These cables have saved my marriage from a terrible divorce that I was about to embark on. For the last 18 months, I have been unable to perform in the bedroom with my wife. My impotence had become a major problem in my marriage. Thanks to DENON and the AKDL1, I not only had the ability to perform, but my johnson also grew 3 inches!! Yes , that is correct 3 inches!! My wife is so happy that she plans on buying these cables and sending them to all her girlfriends. Thank you DENON, you saved my marriage."
4,Thank god I use this cat5 cable on my PC,All of my co-workers went home with The plague. Fortunately due to the healing powers of this cable I was able to resist the black death and keep working. Thanks to the Denon engineers for saving my life! I only gave this product 4 stars because it did not whiten my teeth as quickly as I expected.
4,good product,I chose this rating because I liked the product although it did take a longer than expected time of arrival.
2,okay,"I have very curly hair so i've tried many hair dryers. This one worked okay. I don't think it was anything amazing. Then after 6 months it stopped being able to blow out hot air, only cold. it lasted less time than any other dryer ive had. and i've had many conairs. i suppose this dryer is ok for people who don't use one much."
1,didnt receive,Up to now I have not received this product. One attempt was made to deliver the product and no more.Now the product that I really need is apparently on its way back to the seller according to fedex. I'm very very disappointed to say the least.
4,It is very yellow,"I like this very much. IT's much more yellow than in the picture, but that is alright. It is very much a professional dryer. The add on's that come with it are of good quality. It is powerful and complets drying my hair in about 5 minutes. The warnings that come in the package are kind of scary read them but don't let them discourage you."
5,Reliable And Worth The Extra Money,"As others have noted, Olympus Smart Media Cards are needed for some of the Olympus camera functions, so the card is worth it for that.I have had other cards ""go bad"", but none from Olympus. To me that is worth the few extra dollars, and the price has come down a bit since I bought my last one."
4,Interoperability of Olympus vs other smart media cards,"The only difference between the Olympus and other brands of SmartMedia cards is that only the Olympus SmartMedia card supports the Panorama function of the camera (see owners manual for details, but basically it allows you to stitch up to 10 images together into a panoramic image). If you never use this feature just buy the less expensive memory. If you have a need for panoramas, and already have one Olympus card, use that Olympus card for panoramas, and buy the less expensive SmartMedia cards for all your other photo needs. As an example, on Amazon, the Viking 128MB card is ... cheaper than the Olympus."
1,Fell apart,Was able to use this mattress pad a few times but then it fell apart. The seam that connects it came completely undone and it is not repairable. Very disappointed.
3,They are okay,"The quality is not what it is hyped up to be in the description. I give these 3 stars, at the price paid of $59.99. As another reviewer mentioned, they didn't not ship very sharp. Pretty dull actually, I'm guessing it's their way of trying to get you to purchase the Bodum knife sharpener. I had my own knife sharpener, and transformed these dull knives into something more respectable.These can pass at $59.99, but not any higher. I'd say it's a good deal if you can get these for cheaper. What did I like? The magnetic knife holder seems pretty cool, and the thumb/forefinger position on the handle is great."
1,you get what you pay for,"After having spent hundreds of dollars on Global and Shun knives, I thought why not save a little money and get these nice Bodum knives to use once in awhile? After all, I've never been disappointed with Bodum's cups and coffee presses. And actually, I didn't even know Bodum made knives...and for good reason. They're terrible. The knives arrived covered in dusty grease, and even after washing, still looked dirty. The blades are so thick and heavy, they are more suitable for medieval sword fighting than slicing vegetables. Plus they were dull, even after sharpening. And, like a previous reviewer, I also had something rattling inside the hollow handle. Yuck."
4,Rocking Funk,"From the first listen to this album with all the guitars and screaming,you really dont know whether you should expect some happy happy dance to the music sly stone before there's a riot goin on style funk, or some heavy jimi hendrix style rocking, or some straight out funk like funkadelic or black merda.......mix all these styles together and this is what you are going to get!It is a really great album with some mishaps here and there which is why i give it 4 stars instead of 5.But I dont really want to sound like a critic and I am not one either so straight and simple....if you just want to listen to good music without being picky picky then go right ahead and buy it because you will enjoy it.It is not a masterpiece , and it is not a work of artsy fartsy! This is funky soul rocking plain and simple!"
4,excellent,"I guess there were too many competing soul bands in 1970, because this one should have been a lot bigger.Purple Image only had one album, but wow is it good. Self-titled, it includes funk heavy as Hendrix with music almost straight rock and ballads as sweet as any by the Stylistics or Delphohics. But this band even goes one better: listen to the spanish guitar on ""We Gotta Pull Together."" This is expermentation rare in the era's funk.In a word, excellent. In two more, buy it."
5,A Quality Product,"Not to be forward, but, my wife states that these chocolate flavored condoms are the best tasting we've used so far- Compares them to chocolate cake frosting. We also use the Strawberry flavored condoms offered by Trustex. Another selling point was that as we ordered the 12pk we received a 15 count.. I'm not sure if this is due to the Holidays or what, but, it's pretty cool of the seller. Package is discreet and, as always, safe sex is good sex (married or not)."
5,A great analog Butterfly,Madama ButterflyGiacomo Puccini - musicBiuseppe Giacosa & Luigi Illica - Libretto (sung in Italian)Giuseppe PataneHungarian State Opera OrchestaHungarian State Opera Chamber Chorus - Ferenc Nagy(Hungaroton - ADD - 1981)One of the finest versions of Madama Butterfly ever made. Five Stars
3,cinderella's slippers,"We bought these for my daughter (age 3 1/2, shoe size Toddler 9-10) but had to return them because they were too big and the ""arch"" part of the shoes would buckle under the weight of her heel being on that part of the shoe when she tried to walk. The plastic feels heavy and sturdy to the touch and I thought they'd be fine and that she could wear them for a long time, until she actually outgrew them. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case. We found some others that have adjustable straps around the back of the heel and a much thicker sole. They aren't quite as dainty-looking, but unless you see the two kinds side-by-side, you'd never think about it and at least she can walk in those without any problem."
3,Good idea but Cranium could have done better,"Got this game for the family for christmas. The idea is a good one but I think the makers fell short of ""completing"" the game which could have been alot better. After one game we found out that it would be more fun if we added to the game. We gave different point values (1, 2, and 3) to each piece and gave a bonus if you were able to use all of your cards. This made the game more competitive and fun for everyone. in our first game you would see us shying away from the bg yellow chair and in the second game when it was worth 3 points and a possible bonus we got creative on how to use it.I think the inventors dropped the ball on what a really good game this could have been. Once we altered it, it was alot of fun!"
3,walking with a panther,"this cd was purchased as un censored,however it was full of bleeps and had a skip.it was packaged as a new cd?"
1,The Worst LL Cool J in History,"Walking with a panther 1/2 StarThis is the worst LL Cool J album I've ever seen, I Hated it, Although I Didn't like 14 Shots to the dome, Phenomenon and The DEFintion, but those look like masterpieces compared to this junk, LL's performance is really terrible, the songs are terrible, everything about this album is really bad, Sadly LL Got backlashed and booed pretty harshly in showtime in the apollo in 1989 and what's worse NWA & Public Enemy brought a major change to rap.Thankfully he made a comeback after this and he blew people away this time with Mama said knock you out.This is a dreadful album, absolutely dreadful."
3,"Light, funny reading","A short, funny, light, and very creative book, a compendium of high-tech annoyances in the form of fiction. Unfortunately, there are many spelling errors and the writing style and use of words are not very polished."
4,So far so good,I got this for my kids who play video games from time to time on our home pc. I thought it would be easier for them then using the keyboard keys. All I did was plug it into the back of the pc & it worked right away without any type of extra set up. We have only had it for about a month so only time will tell about the quality of it...but so far so good.
3,Helped with Captain Chair style belts,"While I would agree this is not the end all of car seat safety, it worked OK for us. However, it is difficult for the kids to do up the belt themselves with this attachment. It did solve my problem of the shoulder belt cutting into the neck area. Booster seats don't fit well with Captain's chairs, so it was better than nothing. The Other Safety 1st seat belt adjuster in two parts works much better! But it's not for kids under 50lbs. That one gets a higher rating from me."
1,Doesn't get very cold; doesn't fit well,"I work at a computer all day and my upper shoulders and neck can get sore. I have a big, heavy gel pack that I keep in the freezer. It gets really cold and stays cold for a long time. It relieves my back pain. The only problem is I have to lay on it (of course) and I don't always have the time. I was hoping this product would be something I could wear while I work but it doesn't get very cold and within 20 minutes its body temperature. It also doesn't fit well. It attachs right under your chin, sort of, so its not like you can do much with it on anyway. Very, very disappointed."
5,SAINTS AND MORE,"THIS IS NOT LIKE READING THE MARTYROLOGY IN LATIN. IT IS A WELL RESEARCHED AND THOUGHTFULLY WRITTEN BIOGRAPHY OF NOT ONLY WELL KNOWN SAINTS, BUT THOSE SAINTLY PEOPLE WHO ARE INSPIRATIONAL. THE DAILY READING ARRANGEMENT MAKE IT A GREAT BED SIDE BOOK."
3,"How can this happen in a ""good country""","What is happening to families will effect the future.Most people turn a blind eye to what is really happening to good mothers.This book highlights the belief that ""mothers who lose their children must have done something awful"" is a myth.Another very personal story which also addresses this myth is:A Lioness from Judea Roars: A Lioness from Judea Cries"
3,"Eye opening, but very depressing-does not tell you what you need to know.","The book was eye opening to the fact that mothers in custody battles get screwed all the time. This seemed to be the entire book, stories of mom's who got wronged. I was surprised to see there was no advice in it about the situation. It also did not give you any hope in ever retaining your children back if you lost them to your ex. I can tell you that another book I ordered here on Amazon was GREAT,Winning CustodyBy: Deedra B. HunterThis book will tell you step by step what you need to do, know and so on.I learned alot of the history of child custody and courts favoring fathers for whacko reasons, but it just wasn't what I thought it would be!"
1,Less than insightful,"O.K. Hands down. Do not buy this book unless you are brand new to the game of poker. I thought this would be an insightful book into the world of internet play through the eyes of one of the worlds greatest no limit holdem players. Wrong! This book is an ad for Doyle's Room. This book reminds you of this every 5 minutes. Doyle plays alot online and I thought I might learn something new but all this book told me is the same stuff I have been learning myself by playing online for the past 4 years. There is some good tips but to few to buy this advertisment for Doyle's web site, because once again thats what this book is."
3,Well,"This isn't something that I actually read. It was a gift. However, I guess it didn't offer any info since he isn't rich. Thanks for shipping the book so quick."
2,Very basic,"If you have never read about or played poker online this book might be of some use for you. A good bit of the book is just finding poker information on the internet, setting up a poker account online and the general basics of online play.You could just as easily get most of this information with a Google search and the tutorial on a poker site."
2,For beginners only,"The book is generally full of basic, logical information that should be helpful to someone at the novice level. If you are experienced at all with online poker, however, there is not much that it has to offer. There is nothing in the book that one cannot learn in a short time by simply getting online and playing. Mr. Brunson has a folksy charm that comes through in his book, yet he tends to repeat the same message time and again in slightly different ways when he is trying to make a point. Although a pleasant and interesting read by a former two-time world champion, it lacks the necessary ingredients to help you bring your game along to a strong competitive level."
1,junk,would not get this again it's hard to program and hard to see outside so not worth it get a multifunction watch instead there are many out there that work
3,It works,This is good for small spaces where you don't have to move around much as it is only 8ft. Remember to mount the housing on this so that the cord retracts with out tangling.
4,Mary anne the shy girl... now has a BOYFRIEND!!!!!,"As I said in my title, I cant believe Mary anne has a boyfriend!!! But she does, Logan Brono, to be exact. Here's how it happens: The new guy at school is Logan Brono. Mary anne thinks he's cute. Then the baby-sitters find out..... he's a boy baby-sitter!!! Mary anne cant believe it. So she starts talking to Logan, they talk a bout baby-sitting, and other stuff. Finally, Logan asks Mary anne out, they go out have a great time, and go out a few more times. I don't want to spoil the ending but let me tell you SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND!!!!!"
2,"unbelievable, really..","This was the first book I have ever read from Ms. Michaels. Unfortunately If I don't love book at first read, than I never read another from same author. I'm not proud of this but that's the way I am. I don't know how this was given five stars from even one reader. I realize not everyone's taste is the same but.. There was a certain section in the book that completely turned me off.. A scene at the airport where Emily was going to go away for a couple of months... She hugged her friends, cried, walked a few steps, came back and hugged them again telling them how much she loved them. She acted as if she was never coming back. Get real! I also think she gave herself too much importance as if everyone was supposed to be in awe of her owning fitness centers. ""I'm Emily, of Emily's Fitness Centers..."" So what. Then she talks to the ghost of her dead husband. Too wierd for me. I'll stick to Sandra Brown, my favorite."
5,The best acidophilus probiotic you can buy,There is nothing better in the marketplace regardless of price for promoting good gastrointestinal health. You won't regret this purchase.
5,PB8 Acidophilus Vegetarian Great Product,"Product exceeded my expectations originally had this product recommended in JJ Smith's book, I love it! It really works I am starting to feel like my old self again."
4,In the thick of the Fog of War,"I was never an officer, or a tanker. I did go through NTC, though, as an Army combat engineer attached to the 82d Airborne. If nothing else, Captain Bolger's book showed me behind-the-scenes detail that a lowly S3 Assistant doesn't get to see.But beyond personal experience, this is one of the most concentrated and pungeant exposures I know to what is fondly called the ""fog of war."" To how no plan survives contact with the enemy -- heck, few plans survive long enough to even get you INTO contact with the enemy. Captain Bolger places you in the hot seat, as a company commander trying to juggle too many demands and too little information, huddled over a chemlight on a tank-torn bit of muddy road and wondering how he can possibly get the armor from where it is to where it needs to be...before the OPFOR rolls him up. It is a lesson in how the devil is most definately in the details."
5,Wow! This is an awesome book!,"Ok, so as the author of the book I'm a little biased. This is the story of my 5,000 mile trail run across America on the American Discovery Trail. In 1998, I ran from Delaware to California alone and mostly without vehicle support while wearing a 10-pound hip pack. Along the way I got lost, got chased, and found America through a life-changing trip across the country at six miles per hour."
1,If I ever get it,"The magazine would likely be just fine, but this vender sucks. I ordered it 2 weeks ago and it was supposed to ship after 1-2 weeks. Well I got an e-mail from Amazon saying the delivery estimate was being pushed back another 2 weeks. 1 month just to get a magazine. No company should be that slow. If they are saying the have inventory and do not and are basing these estimates on when new inventory is coming in then they should be listing it as OUT OF STOCK!!!! So likely I will wait another 2 weeks to get another e-mail saying they are pushing back the ship date again. I will never try ordering a magazine here again. I wonder how bad the subscriptions are?"
5,Another great Ga'hoole book,My son and I have really enjoyed the whole Guardians of Ga'hoole series. This book is no exception. The story is well written and holds your attention quite well. We have read all of the series at bedtime and 3-4 chapters a night never seems like enough. We both always want more.This story explains a lot of things mentioned in the other books. It was nice to see the background behind those books. Now we are anxiously awaiting the next addition to this wonderful series.
4,Lasky does it again,Kathryn Lasky has once again prevailed in amazing me with her works of art. I look forward to what she comes up with in her future books!
1,Very boring,"I picked up this DVD because I wanted to learn how to dance hip hop. Even being a complete beginner, I found this DVD to be extremely boring. It is very slow paced and not at all what I expected."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"D is supposed to be a great choreographer and energetic leader? Where was she? The instructor on this DVD had low energy, and her moves are unbelievably bad. The camerawork was not great either, we need to see what the feet are doing at the same time we see what the upper body is doing. UGH!"
5,The Joy of Moth,"This is a wonderful record of epic delights. From start to finish, Mason Proper take you on a wonderful journey through the depths of the sonic underworld. It is rare to hear a debut album so accomplished in its songwriting, harmony and rhythm, but it is rare for music lovers to be gifted a band like Mason Proper. This is a record to be cherished."
4,Good sounding mandolin,"I have tried more a dozen mandolins (5 in my possessions for a few weeks to few months).It is solidly built and has really good sound, although the price is a bit higher than I expected (300$, expected around 200$) as I had another one, Ibanez with more features (trust rod + pickup + volume/tone knobs) for only 245$, brand new.However, for acoustic only, Fender 53S is a very good one, the sound is sweet and loud. I bought it used (second hand) at 80$, spend about 10$ for new strings and a missing tuning button and I am ready to play. This is now my main mandolin for the last 6 months.Recently, I bought a Mountain Tyler transducer for Amazon (24$ shipping included) and spent about 10 mins to install it. Now my Fender 53S is also electric, it sounds really loud when plugged in."
1,PLASTIC - watch out!!,"Plastic instead of ceramic porcelin? from Kohler? I would have thought this company would have made a better product.I ordered this faucet and the matching sink faucet and the cute white old fashioned button is actually white plastic. sending back asap. hope i can find a replacement before the plumber arrives to install. this product should at least state that it's plastic, so that the buyer doesn't waste return shipping money or their time. very disappointed."
3,i totally dissagree with ej rupert,"everyday thang is VINTAGE bone.so ej really need to evaluate what he/she think bone sounds like.that aside from a few other trax this is the only song worth listening too.i do agree with rupert that this soundtrack is kinda off. because it doesn't represent the time period that well.its missing artists like,naughty by nature das efectdigable planetsde la souloutkastdas efectwu-tangice cubewhy biggie has 2 songs?"
3,Landry news review by fellow 5th grader Miget Man Hunter,"Cara Landry is a shy child in Mr.Larson's 5th grade class. Soon the girl who never talks publish a newspaper called,the Landry News. But everything isn't exactly going here way. This book is great if you like contemporary ficton,but if you are like me and like reading fanticy and fiction this would score a 3. So I don't hightly reccomend this book, but I do reccomend it."
3,The Big News,I would recommend the book The Landry News by Andrew Celments. Because it is a great book with a little mystery and very inserting to read. In this book Cara Landry is the main character. She writes a news for new school Denton Elementary. Her teacher is Mr. Larson and he very lazy and loves to read the newspaper each day. She makes her first newspaper and talks about her lazy teacher. Mr. Larson reads the news and gets very mad at Cara. Find out what the rest of this entertaining book is by reading the book.
3,regurgitated Jung....,"....with all the stereotypical interpretations intact. Recommended only as an intro to the Jungian anima/animus ideas, but fully sharing Jung's own equation of femininity with yin, receptive, emotional, irrational and masculinity with yang, active, intellectual, rational."
4,Get an Overview of Old Testament History,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It gave me a good overview of the chronology of the OT from a conservative evangelical view. It also tells what was going on in the kingdoms around Israel, so that you learn why David and Solomon had so much rest from a political viewpoint. It also has some good arguments for earlier datings of the Bible. Good for all Christians, not just Bible Scholars. It's written in a VERY readable format."
3,Slick To An Extent,"The best cuts on here are the reggae-flavored ""Young World"", and ""Children's Story"". Other than that, Slick Rick didn't have too many other songs that I liked. It would have been nice to have ""La-Di-Da-Dee"", but that classic is probably on Doug E. Fresh's greatest hits."
1,the worst cd ever made,this is the worst cd out there. DO NOT GET IT! Slick Rick should be locked up
5,"Dope,Dope,Dope","This cd is dope, phat, fresh, ridiculous, exceptional, spectacular and any other adjective that expresses satisfaction. This is a completely original piece of work and no one will be able to duplicate it ever. Slick Rick is the original storyteller and he tells 'em the best. He makes you feel like your going through what he's saying on record. He's the Richard Pryor of hip-hop. Very talented and even though his other cd's haven't lived up to this one he changed the game with this one alone. If your a true hip-hop head you must have this cd."
4,The Rising of Singer/Songwriters,"Although this LP is several years old, it holds a longevity that a lot of the music that plays on the radio today does not. Mike Younger is still rising in this business and I think that as long as he is writing songs, there are those of us who will always be listening. My favorite songs on this LP are 'If By Chance We Meet Again"" and ""Somethin In The Air"" (Poetic Genius). If you have not heard his new record, it is worth a buy. Mike Younger has matured in his singing and playing, he is tougher and more determined than ever to do the music business his way. Keep writing and singing Mike."
3,"Great messages, not-so-great product quality","I found it a great complement to the book, ""The Psychic Pathway"", having read first, and then listened to the CDs.The author's messages were both inspirational and theraputic.I found the voice quality varied a great deal. There were numerous segments that had far too much bass and too little treble. It was about 50% marginal listening, especially with any ambient noise - sounded like a product not created in a studio environment where technical problems could be ironed out. This detracted from the messages being presented. The tracks could have been listed as to content, which would have been helpful to a listener, but were not. These shortcomings lowered my rating by two stars."
5,great story,"good story ! i thought i predicted the outcome, early on in the book. But i was wrong. I will read more for this author."
4,great book!!!,"This was a great book, not what I expected at all, but I was pleasantly surprised. John Galligan is an author every fisherman should read."
4,A Piece of Blue Sky,Very informative book on the history of Scientology and the man who piloted the movement. Reads a bit like a textbook and can be a bit dry for my tastes but overall it's a great source of info.
1,Destructive Words,"Anyone who makes a decision about Scientology based on this book, should probably review world history first. Every single person, included Jesus, who wanted to help mankind in any way, was always persecued, criticized, tortured, destroyed... I would suggest you readers to learn about the 'other side of the story' ... you'll be able to judge for yourselves AFTERWARDS. Be intelligent. Be reasonable. Do not repeat like robots what others say: read books on scientology, realize what it can do to make your life better, and I'm positive you'll change your point of view as soon as you discover all by yourself that it's all about working for a better world. And this goes for absolutely everything in life. Check the facts, do research. Be objective. Then you can make your choice."
4,Interesting Study of Social Manipulation,"(...)Having given that caveat, my own conclusions: this is a wonderful story about using religious/scientific jargon along with time-tested social manipulation/control methodologies to manufacture a 'movement'. What the author exposes from his own experience can be applied to most individuals in their lives.And some of the 'tenets' of this religion are not to be missed- imagine for yourself what happens when an egocentric science-fiction author makes up his own theology!"
1,A Piece of Blue Sky,"This from an impartial look at this book. I checked out both side, I saw what the book wanted to do and was curious. I was quite disappointed, a waste of time, sorry but I am frank. The message is hard to get at and none of the facts, after I did my own investigations turn out to be true. A let down folks. If you want the truth about something, the best source is always the source."
1,Discreditable Intentions,"This book should be entitled ""A Flight of Wild Hallucination"". It would appropriately describe the state of mind of its writers. Their intentions are none but discreditable.I have examined the actual materials of Scientology, and what I found left my mouth hanging agape. Scientology is a religion because it addresses man as a spiritual being, but within that framework of religion the subject consists of technology, technology that restores to the individual his native abilities. Scientology is about the recovery of ability. This technology is quick, precise, exact, and invariable in result. Such thing has never existed before in the history of the world.Scientology completely obsoletes and makes unnecessary such earlier failed subjects as psychology and psychiatry.The technology of Scientology works.Of course the writers of this book smear Scientology. They would attack any betterment activity. That is their essential nature. They are cowards."
5,"Bought it as a gift, but that was I had one myself and it is a great little appliance","It is so very convenient. Heats up very very fast and the water is ready for cocoa, coffee, etc. I recommend it as it is dependable and well made."
2,Not the greatest..,We bought this tea kettle and it took me a long time to use it because the water did taste plasticy. That finally wore off and everything was fine until a couple of months later I noticed it was rusted along the inside seams. I mailed it back to Edgecraft and they contacted me regarding a different replacement (they didn't have this one in stock). We opted for the Chef's Choice 679 glass model. When it arrived we discovered the inside had quite a bit of silicone sealant in it in addition to plastic parts. I refused to use it so husband took it to work.In the end we bought the $30 Aroma model at Target and so far love it. I washed it and boiled a couple of pots of water to prep it. Haven't had any plasticy tasting water. Very pleased with the price as well!!!
1,Died in 6 weeks,I did a lot of research and expected this to be a great purchase. It worked wonderfully while it worked but died after 6 weeks. It simply will not turn on any more. I flick the switch and it no longer heats. There seems to be a short.
3,Pretty good,"This kettle works very well so far. We've had it for a couple of months now, and it sees a lot of use-- this is an office/classroom setting, so it heats water for people several times a day. My only complaints are design-related: the long cord is a bit difficult to stow out of the way, and the lid doesn't really open wide enough-- this might be intended as some sort of safety feature, but it makes filling the kettle slightly annoying. But it gets the job done!"
1,Clunky and heavy!,"I've had several electric kettles over the years, and this is the first one I felt compelled to send back. The handle was hard to grip, as it is too wide and ackwardly shaped--even my husband, who has average size hands--thought so. And it was heavy, even without the water in it. Also, the sensor that tells it to shut off when the water boils, was slow to activate so it boiled for almost a minute before shutting off. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Almost perfect,"We've had this model for several years now, and I'm back to replace it. It's a good size, it boils fast, and we've been very happy with it. The only complaint I have is the lid, which cracked after about a year. We superglued it back together and it worked fine for about another year before it got another crack. More superglue... but still happy with it. Finally the third crack, about four or five years after we bought it, broke a piece entirely off. I expect if we'd glued it again we could hobble along for a little while, but it's time to give in. I haven't decided whether to go with the exact same model again (we really were quite happy with it overall) or to take a chance on something else.... but I'm leaning toward getting this one again."
2,Electric plug failure,This electric kettle worked just fine for a little over a year. Then the plug overheated and started melting and smoking at the outlet. The outlet was ruined. This failure could have caused serious damage or a fire. Extremely disappointing!! THIS ITEM SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET!!!!!! I would like to hear from the manufacturer!!!!
3,Doesn't shut off fast enough,"Keeps boiling for a long time before shutting off (if indeed it does; I haven't waited). Also doesn't switch off when lifted from its base -- when you put it down again, it keeps boiling). Otherwise seems fine.The search for the perfect kettle continues!"
2,what a shame,"When i got this, i was very excited. It worked wonderfully for like six months. Then the honeymoon period wore off. First the on/off button wouldnt work. Fortunatley, it broke in the on position. Then later, the lid latch wouldnt stay closed, so now its always open. Finally, leaks are appearing along the base. It was a quick and torid romance, but now I'm back to shopping around for the perfect electric tea kettle."
1,Very poor durability - about a year,"Like other reviewers here we had this kettle around 12 months only before it died. On average we probably used it 2-3 times a day to boil water for hot tea and a coffee press. We weren't unhappy with it while it worked but one day it just died - seems like some kind of electrical issue as the power socket it was plugged into showed signs of overheating (browning, slight melt etc.). If it only lasts a year that's very poor - there are much better options I believe - we replaced it with a T-Fal and so far have been very happy with that (plus it seems to boil faster than the Chef's Choice)."
2,"too big, too heavy","One of my biggest gripes about appliances is that theyseem to be designed by young male engineers (with normalupper body strength and big hammy hands) with no clueabout the age and strength of the actual intended user.I'm a late-middle-age woman, rather short, with smallhands, who likes a cup of tea in the afternoon. AndI can lift this kettle, but barely. It actually hurtsmy shoulder and it's heavy enough to make my armtremble. NOT SAFE!An inappropriate gift (or purchase) for an elderly woman.Please, someone, design a smaller stainless cordlesskettle."
2,I'm on my third kettle!,"I love the way it works, but it stops working just about when warranty is up.I'm on my third kettle!"
2,Doesn't last,I have had three of these and will never order another. They work really well for about 3 months then they die. I am a heavy user of these kettles and while they work they work great but they just don't last. I gave it three chances but no more. I am looking into different kettles because my third kettle just died.
4,Edge of Seat,"Loved this book. recommended to anybody who likes to be kept on the edge of their seat. Full of twists and turns, gives some hints about the twists, but you can't be sure until you get there. Great."
4,The Shadow Hunter,Yes I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys a mystery. It meets my criteria and more. I am sure others will enjoy it as much as I did.
3,Just OK,I didn't really like this book. I only read first couple of chapters and didn't want to read any more.
5,release,I read this book 2 years ago when originally released. Bought it again when I received an Amazon email of a new release by this author....
3,Shadow Hunter,A good indepth study of a deluded mind. Not too technical . Fast paced with a twist. An enjoyable read.
3,"No competitors from which to choose, but fine for what it is","First: we are talking about a shaker of actual gold flakes. Anything negative probably falls into the category of, ""Seriously? You just bought a shaker of GOLD FLAKES."" That being said, the shaker itself could be better; the flakes come out all right and not too clumpy, which is good--I'm using these for a specialty cocktail--but I have a feeling about 30% of the gold I just paid an outrageous sum for is going to end up stuck to the sides of the shaker with no way to extract.Also. I know it's real gold, but this price is just silly. I can't use the candy gold flakes for my purpose so I'm stuck with these guys, and I do appreciate they make a hard to find product, but their margin must be astronomical."
2,Amazon Verified Purchase OF A Course in WOOD TURNING CD,There were no instructions furnished with the CD. It looks like the CD should be accompanied by a book or as part of web site. I have not figured it out as yet. If I can't figure it out soon I will send it back.
1,"Slow - boring, subpar.","Any 5 star rating of this film is simply not an honest rating - it is the rating of someone wanting you to see this film - like a poorly made religious film with nothing but 5 star ratings from people with an agenda.The film is slow, boring and subpar on all levels with the exception of the one professional actor whose face is on the cover - no doubt to legitimize this bush league film.If it were anywhere near as good as all the 5 star ratings would indicate - ask yourself - why had you never heard about it? In country wide polls taken when this movie came out it had a rating of about 2.5"
5,"Important, poignant, powerful","I'm writing this seconds after watching Memorial Day and I have to say the acting, plot, camera work are all well done, but it's the themes underneath the film that make it shine: sacrifice, courage, patriotism, family, love... Call me simple or idealistic, but in a cynical and jaded culture, this is a very moving film that captures the essence of service. I'm glad I took the time to watch it. Highly recommend."
4,good,It was actually not that bad. I for one think anybody should rent this not buy.The movie was really exiting and a little of it was funny.
4,"Ho hum story, but great photography and weapons","The story was ok, but was a great vehicle for great photography, editing, sound, and, effects. The producers had super participation from the both the state National Guard and WWII re-enactors. So, the military chatter was all real as was weapon handling and tactics. All of this went to making a very visually pleasing event. The audio was very good as well.My only nit was everything in the WWII scenes was pristine. Weapons, uniforms, and, gear, all appeared to have been issued the day before - not the case for units in the field. Still, this DVD is a keeper."
5,WHAT A GREAT GAME!,"Love this game! Not some ""homemade plastic"" breakable kind either! I have had mine for over a year now and its in great shape! Great for camping too!"
3,Good Learning Supplememtary,"I began this book in the fouth grade. I wanted to excel in mathematics and geometry. Answers were somewhat accuarate; when they were not I was utterly perplexed.The Algebra section was clear; I often needed to re-read sections to understand information expressed. Geometry was almost clear, again I needed to re-read and was sometimes confused. Analytic geometry was very puzzling- I needed adult assistace. Trig was very clear, and I now have a good grip on trig. Readers for this book should consider buying another ^workbook^ as to achieve stronger levels of understanding from practice. Being determined to understand, this was essential."
4,GREAT ITEM!!!,overall great gadget! i got it for the wifey as a birthday present. she is always doing presentations and needed something really reliable and that works from a distance. the only disappointment is that the usb reciever does not also work as a flash drive.
5,PLEASE make a GREEN laser version!!,"This is certainly would the THE BEST laser pointer ever out there if it would be a GREEN Laser. PLEASE PLEASE Kensington make green laser version and I will be the first to buy a bunch. Else their design is is smart, small and smooth!!"
5,Kensington 33374 Wireless Presenter,"Compact, easy setup, built in storage AND a laser pointer! And finally, it runs on AAA batteries~ the best of all worlds. Great item at a great price!"
5,Just what we needed,This wireless presenter works perfect in our building. We use it regularly from a distance of about 40 feet and it never misses a beat. The price was right too.
5,Kensington 33374 Wireless w pointer works Great.,This is great technology. Plug and play - easy to use - very beneficial in presentations. Great value too.Ron
5,A cool presentational tool,Kensington 33374 Wireless Presenter with Laser PointerThis is a great presentational tool. I am a teacher and I do a lot of power point presentation. It gives me the chance not to be in the same area in the classroom. I can move around. With the laser pointer I can point at a word or at a picture and my students who are visual learners know what I am talking about.
5,Great little clicker,"I loved this remote for my power point presentation. I bought 2. I was using one and my other teacher was using the other. The size was very nice with versatile buttons. The other teacher's batteries died after about 50 hours of use. Mine kept going. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small, in-your-hand pointer. The laser is very small, but that wasn't crucial to what I was doing."
4,Great Product!,The remote worked very well and with very good range in a large meeting room. The plug and play feature is really excellent - immediate and with no fear of software or install issues when plugging in for an instantaneous presentation on any computer system. The remote could be a tad smaller but fits comfortably in the hand. The laser pointer was a bit hard to see on a very bright presentation screen but this may have been more a function of the screen that the device since it worked well in other settings.
1,Didn't Work - Had to Return!,I ordered this item and put a rush on the delivery because I needed it for an upcoming presentation that I was giving. Thankfully I tested it out before hand - this is a peripheral that should be plug and play and it flat out did not work. It was defective and I had to go through the hassle of returning. I should have just gone to the store 5 minutes down the road to purchase a similar device that actually worked - which is what I ended up doing!
4,USB fits into Macbook Air,"If you are looking for sleek design, this may not be it. But it is very comfortable to hold and reliable.I used to have this presenter w/ laser pointer, which worked great, but one of the batteries exploded inside (not the fault of the laser pointer), so I had to get a new one. I searched for a sleek design and bought one. Different brand. Unfortunately it wouldn't fit into my Macbook Air when the power cord was also plugged in. So I had to buy the Kensington 33374 again. The plastic part on the USB connection is not as wide or thick, so it should fit on any laptop, as it fit my Macbook Pro.Manufacturers should include a warning sign that their product might not be suitable for certain laptops due to its bulky USB connector."
4,love my toy!,this works great in my classroom... i can walk around and run powerpoint interactive lesson with my students... love it!
5,Works as described,"Works as promised. Basic & functional. I love the simplicity of this pointer: back, forward, point, black. That's all I use. This is the second kensington pointer I own and I never had a problem (upgraded for the pointer). I use it on my MacBook and works all the time (initially it thinks it is a keyboard, but just cancel the dialog and will not ask again). I've plug it to other machines (Mac/Win) and sets up very quickly and without a problem. Pointer is bright and has a very good range. Highly recommended."
5,Great Product!,"Very easy to use. I love that the USB plug-in stores in the remote so you don't risk losing or damaging it. It has a laser pointer, back button, forward button, and screen black-out button. I was able to stand a good distance away from the computer and still was able to click through the Power Point presentation. I would definitely recommend this product!"
3,Laser button acts like F5 key,"We ordered several of these remotes to use at work in our conference rooms, and overall, they work great. Very easy to install, no drivers needed, the buttons are responsive and easy to press. It's a slick remote and looks professional.I gave this a 3 because of one irritation, which is that pressing the laser button while in a program other than PowerPoint produces the same effect as pressing the F5 button on the keyboard. In IE, the screen refreshes; in our accounting program, the help box pops up. I know it's advertised as a presentation slide remote, but it's nice to be able to use the laser with other types of programs that are part of the presentation. Instead, it has been rather disruptive and distracting during meetings. It irritated one of our directors so much, we must order replacements of different mfg for them all."
3,Hidden and Confusing,"This is a good book, but the constant changing of names and back-and-forth writing style can be very confusing at times."
3,"All the way live in tha ""95""!","I was in love with this cd back in the 6th grade. My favorite tracks were #1,2,and 4. Even to this day He's Mine (Remix) is still the jam. Listening to this cd now as a Senior in College many of the lyrics and those very wack raps seem to be very juvenile and not clearly thought out but hay that's the music of the 90's!!!"
4,"Nice try, but no cigar","I was really excited to see HP had released a new RPN calculator that looked- well - like a traditional HP calculator.Not like one of those weird sci-fi inspired horrors like the HP-33s.Unfortunately, the HP-35s falls somewhat short of the mark.My complaints:1) The case is too wide and too deep, making it awkward to hold in your hand.2) The case feels hollow and chintzy. The HP calculator's of my youth felt solid, hefty.3) The 2 lines of display is just confusing. Who's idea was that??4) Where's the slipcase? The zippered pouch blows.5) Algebraic mode? You have to be kidding! This was probably dreamed up by the guy who suggested the 2 line display.Although I occasionally use the 35s, my main calculator continues to be the 32sII. (Luckily I acquired a stash of them beforethe prices went sky high on Ebay)-j"
3,"Haven't actually had my hands on it, but feel need to correct Dobbins on RPN","(review edited to remove pointless griping that HP won't read anyway)(leaving review here to point out how RPN is, in fact, supposed to work)(note, I am required to leave rating, so I'm still going with average of three stars, which I think is a fair thing to do)Charles has it right about RPN...my old 28S worked correctly. RPN does NOT mean ""leaving something in the input buffer when you press ENTER."" Yes, you should not NEED to press enter, but doing so should not affect your calculation (2 E 3 E + and 2 E 3 + should BOTH give 5 as output). Note, this error in implementation actually started with the 32SII."
3,Not 100% convinced,"I liked the previous HP models better. I bought the new HP 35s which is ok.I think quality wise HP has downgraded its calculators. NonethelessIt is an acceptable product. HP calculators used to be by far the preferredchoice for Engineers due to its functionality; Now they are another Texas instrumentor Casio Calculators. (in other words, another one from the bunch)"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"It is a shame that HP has released such a ergonomically poor design, although the calculator has the look and feel of the older classic calculators; that is about the only thing you get for your money. The functionality of this calculator can be described as confusing and very poorly thought out, it is hard to believe that HP has released this model with its present flaws. As an example; simple things like numerical base conversions which should be a straight forward function using a few key strokes, will leave you wondering. However, when you try such conversion in this calculator it will leave you scratching your head for an answer and don't bother looking for the answer in the user's manual, because the so called ""user's manual"" has very little information about anything and it is pretty much useless."
4,Feels Cheap,"This calculator has a very cheap, light feel to it. Purchase it for the NCEES administered PE exam because it was one of two on the list of approved calculators. A friend of mine purchased this one and the Sharp option and abandoned this one. I stuck with this one because once you start using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), you never go back."
4,Nice but wouldn't it be better to issue it in the 15c layout?,"A very nice calculator, finally. Although I still don't understand why HP cannot simply put all this functionality into a 15c-like form. The relevant production line still exists and is fully operational (it makes the 12c calculator whose form is identical to that of the 15c). All the complaints about the display and the buttons would go away instantly. Why fixing something that's not broken? Weird.Someone complained that there were only 26 program labels (A..Z) and that it limited the number of programs to 26. This is not really true in the sense an easy workaround exists: one can add a new program by following an old one's final RTN statement by the first line of the new one without LBL as the first line. Simply make a note of the first line number of the new program somewhere (like ""C127"") and invoke it via ""XEQ C127"" rather than XEQ <single letter>."
3,It's decent.,"I bought this calculator because it was one of the RPN calculators that is accepted for the FE exam. The calculator seems alright although I really like my HP50G so it's different. I think the stack is too short. It can only hold 4 items. Also, the enter key is in the middle of the calculator instead of bottom right. I just think that's odd."
3,hard to turn ON,"This is my 1st HP, I bought it for use during the upcoming PE exam, the problem I've detected to this point is that when I press the ON key like I would press any other key the calculator does not respond, I have to apply alot more pressure to get it started.I'am somewhat concern that it may fail me during to exam, my back-up is the Casio fx-115 es, both calculators are approved for use during the exam, I actually prefer the HP because it has more functions and better manipulation, but I don't like the reliability issue I'am having with the ON button.It may just be this unit, but, I have an older version of the Casio, this calculator is at least 7-10 years old and starts up everytime."
2,Batteries drained without use.,"A year ago I purchased a HP 35s Scientific Calculator. I changed the batteries set 3 times and every time were dead without any use to justified the batteries replacement. I Contacted HP and they may not honor the warranty because a contacted them 2 weeks after the purchase date receipt. Before I contact HP I spend 7-8 weeks to sorted out the problem, but I never imagine that the calculator will drain the batteries while it was powered off. I still waiting for HP answer, I hope they honor the warranty."
3,Seems to be working...,"This a review of the Duofilm wart removing fluid, not the kids patch. When a podiatrist examined my condition, he recommended the Duofilm medicine at a nearby Walgreens store. The process seems to be working well after the first appliance of the formula. The cover on the medicine also claims to be waterproof, which I found to be true. Also, the coating that the fluid leaves after drying covers a wart so that the healing process will not be interrupted. The only downside is a minor one. The liquid can be very messy if not handled carefully. It can leak onto the surrounding skin near the wart. If this happens too frequently, it can become painful and very difficult to remove. But, after all, it is medicine, and should be handled with extreme caution.Overall I recommended this item, but not for children or people who are careless.Secondhand tip: The duration of healing is 10 to 12 weeks."
4,LOVE THIS CD!!!,"I used to play the hell out of this CD! Sweet Potato Pie was my jam! Domino was talking some serious mess, and I was digging the beat. Glad to see it's still available....remembering early 90's funk!....""I'm all messed up and I don't know why"".......Hey! Excuse me, I'm singing along! :)"
4,love this album,"Now, there aint no one that didn't remember 'getto jam', when i first heard it in late 93 i didnt really like dominos flow too much, but after a couple of more times hearing it, having it stuck in my head, then hearing it in the 94 slam dunk competition I decided to get it. And I was glad I did. He is not the best at vocals, but his beats were tight and they just went ok together. Definately sh#t that brings back memories and a classic to me. Its quite a short album, but still worth getting if you are after the oldschool classic stuff or remember it. Anyway, peace. Later!"
4,would do business with again,Book arrived promptly in stated condition. Good service; would do business with this seller again.

3,lacking legacy support is a big minus,"this tiny baby is small, lightthe screen is same as new backlit SP, just smallerbut there's a major minus: no legacy supportyou can play legacy GB/GBC games, GBA games onlyalso, ALL accessories (including data cable, AC adaptor, battery, bluetooth adaptor) used on GB/GBC/GBA/SP can't be used on this babyif you have some legacy GB/GBC games, go for SP instead"
3,Zalman King's thesis project,"I believe this film was a thesis project circa soCal late 60's early 70's (USC/UCLA?). Zalman King/Johnny (to create/write, produce such films as Wild Orchid, Red Shoe...) was probably a student or aspiring actor at the time. It is the story of Johnny, a '60's hippy/anti-establishment ski bum, faced with the reality of selling out for cold hard cash or maintaining his true, natural self. It is a dated, quaint look at the hippie philosophy and lifestyle, but, as with many of his future works, it has its moments. If you want to experience a countercultural, trippy nostalgia piece with some wonderfully photographed ski footage and interesting cast/cameos (look for Jackson Browne, for one), pick it up. If you are a fan of Zalman's best work (9 1/2 Wks, Siesta, etc.), this should provide a glimpse of the youthful inspiration that begat the later work and might be worthy of 4 stars. I believe the film is based on the book by Romain Gary."
4,Pretty Good Sounds,DJ James Andersen redeems himself a bit after the live disappointment at the 1999 Hot'Lanta Party. This cd has some new and old sounds with a few surprises.
3,Better for older kids,"We bought this for our son when he was 1yr old. He wasn't interested in it at all. I got it out again when he was two but he didn't quite get the connection between the keyboard and the tv. Got it out again at 3 and now he is developmentally more advanced than the lessons on the cartridges. That being said, he does enjoy playing with it even though he already knows the shapes and colors. He asks to play his game every morning.I agree with the previous review about the cartridge that comes with the system being the best. We had bought the baby einstein one and it is pretty boring."
4,Delinsky is a great writer,"I really enjoyed this continuation of ""The Dream"", although I could have used a little bit more information about the hero and heroine from the previous book. However, I soon became wrapped up in the lives of the hero and heroine of this book because Ms. Delinsky is wonderful at giving descriptive details of where the characters are and what they are feeling. The only thing that bothered me was that it seemed Gideon fell in love with Chris so quickly. One minute he can't stand her, and the next minute he is begging to spend time with her. But it was a sweet story and I really did enjoy it. I recommend it to everyone."
1,THEY SUB A 428-AOO,"I ORDERED 428-700 AND RECEIVED 428-A00. The main burner puts out less BTU (about 5,000)"
1,awful dc book...,"i love the dc universe, and i'm puzzled why everyone loves the new frontier. it's pretty bad. not only is it extremely boring and poorly written, but it's also obviously written by a total hippie trying to push his shiny happy ideals on you. this is one reimagining of the past that didn't need to be done, or i should say should have been done a whole lot better than this."
5,"GREATEST RAP ALBUM EVER, NO WAIT....EVER!!!!!!!","Sounds as good today as it did 16 years ago. Way better than 50 cent and 100x more intelligent. The beats flow and there is just something about this that makes it a classic. This is one of the best albums I own. Buy it now...........A classic, seriously."
4,A standout in the golden age of hip-hop,"I remember seeing ads for this album and thinking ""who are these two knuckleheads""? Then I heard a song (Gas Face) on a mix show in Atlanta and tracked down who it was, and it was 3rd Bass! I bought the album and was blown away! I would definitely put this with De La Soul, Stetsasonic, Tribe, Pharcyde as a classic. Their flow was tight, production was immaculate!Truth be told, Pop Goes The Weasel was the beginning of the end for them. Instead of doing what they did, they somehow felt the need to to crack on someone who was already a joke. Pretty lame in my opinion, even with Henry Rollins as Vanilla Ice in the video! They had a great thing going and it seemed a bit desperate for approval.Overall, one of the great under appreciated hip hop albums (yes entire cohesive albums) of all times!"
4,"Better than the beastee Boyz, Before Eminem!!!","The music behind the band makes me forget that these guys are white. NY embraced these guys cause they were nice. Some of those new guys need to step up. Beats and rhymes were up there with everyone who was out (epmd, kane, rakim, ll cool j, de la soul)."
1,To herky jerky,I can't tell you how annoying I found this DVD to be. Jumping around in ridiculous patterns that make no sense. I was not happy with this one at all.
3,Boring for Advanced Exercisers,"I am not a fan of this video. I consider myself an advanced exerciser and I hardly worked up a sweat with this video. Michelle's ok but I was bored with this. If you want more of a challenge with fun music, try Chalene Johnson's Turbo Jam."
5,From an old Soldier,I served two tours in Vietnam and the book brought back many memories of those I remember well who so closely paralleled the characters depicted in this wonderful story. A very accurate portrayal of both the violence and the love that was so much a part of the culture he writes about.
5,A great read,I had trouble putting the book down. It was a beautiful love story along with a suspenseful adventure tale of the Vietnam war. Great character portraits in the book along with an excellent history lesson from the days of the Indo-China war to the mid 70's. It was obvious the author lived many of those experiences in Vietnam - too well told to be otherwise.
1,Levi's 501 Jeans,"I've been happily wearing the same size of 501's for over 50 years; however, the the four pairs I recently received were returned because the fit was nothing like that of the past. The waist was true to size but the legs were so tight in the thighs they fit like leotards."
4,"big, brown and baggy","Fast. A replacement pair of 501s arrived promptly after I submitted a ""rejection"" due to some sort of red-on-brown/bleach-like mark smack in the middle of the fly of the first pair. (If my fly is to be marked I'll find someone to do it myself, thank you very much!) Brown 501s are sorta toasty cool. I forgot how they fit though so on a body with a case of NOASSATALL they're quite baggy. Not their fault, mine. Doing business through Amazon was fast and easy, especially with the return."
3,zipperless,"You did not tell me I could NOT zip down my fly.... THe metal buttons were such a mettle. At 82 years old, its a bit of a task to try to take a pee.. I like the jeans otherwize..."
2,A little disappointed.,"The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline, an endless abyss. The back label, which supposedly should be leather, cardboard seems now. The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least, in my experience, has been. I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world. Previously, a Levis jeans was a piece ""almost perfect"", today I can not say the same. I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans."
2,Good fit but poor quality,"I have worn this brand and style for years but the quality has been compromised. I ordered three pair to replace my worn out jeans. Good fit but lousy quality. I will order another brand to wear to work. When did the quality change? What is the best value now? Very disappointing, but typical with manufacturers trying to save on the cost."
1,Colored 501's are not 501s,"I have been wearing brown 501 jeans for 20 years, and in the last few years the product changed completely. The fabric is thin. This fit is off (way too baggy), and they wear out much faster. Same is true for the olive green 501's. The old stiff shrink to fit indigo 501's seem to still be okay, but these colored ones are like a different brand. I wish Levi's would understand that there are some people willing to pay more to get a quality product. Do not buy this garbage."
1,I hate these jeans,"Jeans with a button fly... Are you kidding me??? If this was stated in the description, I missed it. You can keep this!!!"
1,These aren't the original Levis,"I don't know where these were made, but Levis should be ashamed for allowing other stores, especially one hosted by Amazon, passing these off as the real McCoy. These were cheap fabric, thin fabric, were way bigger than they should have been and simply not the Levis I remember. Go to the Levis store. Don't buy these!"
3,"W33 L32, Rinse","My husband has used Levi's since 1998. From time to time he bought other brands, but he always returned to Levi's. He asked me to buy a pair of Levi's 501 as a present for his brother (size is W33L32, in ""Rinse"" color). The pair of Levi's 501 from Amazon was made in Egypt. This pair is really worse than all pairs of Levi's 501 we have bought before (their were made mostly in Turkey).I don't want to say ""It's a bad jeans"", but I'm not sure the regular price is OK for it (I bought cheaper). Fabric is good. Size is correct. Color is good. This pair of jeans wasn't made accurately. It looks made hastily. If I could see it offline I'm not sure I would like to buy it."
5,evodio guacaran,excelente el producto lo recomiendo .... ..... .... .... .... .... .... ... ... ... ... ... .. .. .. .. ..
1,Levis defective sizes,"I bougth this levis 501 34x30 as always i do, but it is smaller than the ones that i buy in Levis stores, JCpenney or Sears , i realy dont know waths happening with Levis sold in Amazon this is second time that I will not use a pair of Levis.I will never buy again levis in Amazon, don't loose your money in chinese cheap levis"
5,only good jean in 34 L,we consistently buy levis from amazon. my 16 y/o is 6'1 and we can never ever find any brand of jean in a 34 L except here. he's also slim and most long pants come with a big waist.we can find 30 x34 on amazon esp the levis. he still wears them half down his rear though despite them finally being long enough!
1,not received the product.,"so far not received the product, I am awaiting a response from the store and do not give me solutions."
1,Answer of the order.,"I bother much made salary this order so that I have not even received the product, the purchase makes it already but of a month it wanted to have answer of that order"
2,Fabric isn't the genuine tough stuff!,"I am really disappointed in the quality of these jeans. what happened to the ""tough as nails"" denim we know and LOVE?This new fabric doesn't seem to be denim at all. My husband won't even try them on. Let's get the real LEVIS back."
1,disappointed,"NOT a 501! the material is very thin,even not denim. the size is smaller than the 501s i bought before. Really disappointed. I'd rather pay more to get a real 501."
3,good,"I did not like the fact the jean, but lacks a bit of quality to the product, is the requested size, the color is the same as the publication"
5,Top of the Heap,"501s are still the Standard by which all other jeans are judged.They're unbeatable categories of style, comfport and durability!"
4,Levi lost a step,I'm a Levi lifer. The thinner denim and new pocket stitching looks more like cost effective bean counting than a style statement. Still a good product but I want great jeans.
1,New material,"If I had wanted blue burlap sack, I would have looked for it. Levi now thinks they can flog off any material on their customer. The last time I ordered these levis I got something in stripes that looked like I was escaped from prison. Now it is burlap! I will never order anything from Levi again until they come back to the original levi material. What complete junk. This product sucks."
3,"Fit Great, Flawed Belt Loop Spacing","I swear they've changed the belt loop spacing on these, but I don't have an older pair to compare it with.If you look at the rear picture, you'll notice the belt loops are only side, then one in the middle of the back. That's a long stretch and my belt slips upward so part of it is higher than the top of the jeans.But, yeah, they're 501s. There you go."
1,broke,"I bought a 501 and broke under the clasps, and it had used only three times, now do not understand why these pants are not the same quality as before"
2,Not a good experience,"Hadn't had a pair of 501s in a long time, was tired of cheap, thin ""jeans"", want some good old Levi's denim... I don't know what these are, but they sure aren't denim... about half the thickness of what I remember Levi's being... The stitching looks cheap... I may or may not buy something with the Levi's brand on it again, but I'll never buy jeans online again. ""Made in Haiti""; seriously?"
5,Excelente..,"excelente producto.. en buen estado vale la pena comprarlo, el vendedor excelente llego todo a tiempo y en muy buen estado."
2,New Denim,The fit was fine. 34x30 is just right. The color is super ugly. I should say colors.The material has several colors running both vertical and horizontal. The colors range froma sort of beige to navy blue with some light blue and green mixed in. I'm going to keep thembecause returning them is a pain and I can wear them in my shop where no one but I will seethem. The rivets are no longer copper color. They look like zinc plated brass.The color of the denim was supposed to be Tidal Blue. It must have been a really bad tide.
4,Good product - great price,"These jeans are quite comfortable and well made. Not quite as substantial as my old 501's from the days of old, but that seems to be the way of denim these days. I've only washed them three times so far but, so far, they did not shrink nearly as much as I thought they would, especially in the length."
5,Comes complete with 2 full pant legs in the pair,"Amazing. A pair of pants to put your legs in. Made of a material known as denim. Also, brown is a color."
2,For 35 yrs I have purchased almost exculsively 501's.....,"NOT what I expected; what I recieved fit pretty much the same but the color is a bit off (not crucial for me), however--of paramont importantce--the fabric is NOT the same. Seems lighter and does not have that soft fuzzy, heavy feel after first couple washings that I love. These are either fake Levies or the brand is slipping. I will look for other sources or other brands for the first time in decades. These are $20-$25 jeans not $40 plus."
1,I'll never buy jeans online again...,"The fabric and colour are very different than the one that appear in amazon,they are not a classic jean, they don't fit well and they are expensive...."
1,Timberwolf is not Sand,"Nothing wrong with these pants, just be warned the color you see on display is not what you will receive.501 Original Fit Timberwolf in the picture look exactly like the 501 Shrink To Fit Sand jeans.The actual Timberwolf color you will receive is a much greener shade than what you see here, and does not look at all like Sand."
5,Amazing! But read this review for useful info!,These are amazing. My husband loves them. They are a lot lighter then darker ones which he likes. He uses darker shade for work and these for dress! They Are ****NOT***** SHRINK TO FIT! So make sure you realize that when ordering them if you typically order shrink to fit. My husband gets 35width 38 length in the shrink to fit and a 33 36 in the regular!
5,Excellent purchase.,"Great purchase! The black 501 jean is great choice. Excellent product as well the time of delivery.The product was made in Egipt, good quality, just in time an price according standars"
5,Good product ...,Very nice color and size to perfection as usual.The only thing different note is that the fabric is a bit softer and thinner than previous ones I've bought
3,Sizing problems ugh,"I like levi's 501's but i guess they don't make em like they used too, as the saying goes. I am talking about the original non shrink to fit ones. the pants I ordered are very different in material and sizing as pants I bought last year, which I really liked, the sizing on new pants seems to be odd, slightly shorter leg length and smaller waist size from my last year 501's and other brands of pants. I am a usually a 30x30, but I had to return the pants 2 times due to unsatisfied sizing, 1st I ordered 31x30 but those didn't work, next I ordered the 30x32 but these pants will come on Friday. I called Levis and they said their sizing for 501's hadn't changed in 2 years, WHY THE HELL would you change the fit of your pants!UGH"
4,501 - button fly!,"I forgot that 501 = button fly which is not my favorite. However, the fit, they are Levi's and I needed a white pair of pants."
4,Muy bueno el producto,el producto es excelente solo que si van a comprar mas de uno haganlo en una misma compra o por lo menos el mismo dia para reducir peso del envio
1,not what i ordered and looks like fake ...,"Length:: 0:13 MinsI ordered a slim fit 501 Rinse-coloured 501 together with another Black pair of 501.The Black pair arrived as described (slim fit) but this Rinse-coloured pair was pre-shrunk 501 !Also take a look at the video I have attachedThe red tab by the side of the pocket where ""Levi's"" is supposed to be is blank !Makes me wonder if this thing is even genuine ?I have bought many pairs of Levi's jeans over the years and I have never come acrossa pair without the ""Levi's"" red tab.Would definitely think twice before ordering anymore Levi's online in future !"
2,Not Shrink to fit,They claim these are shrink to fit and they are not.I am not happy. Of course they will not fit well I know to never purchase from them again.
2,Not like the old 501's,"I have been wearing 501's since I was a kid and these are quite inferior to the 501's I purchased several years ago. I have 5 pairs of these new 501's all less than two years old. Every one has split in the crotch area after about 6-8 months. I used to get 4-5 years out of a pair and usually they only wore through in the knees. As other reviewers have stated, they seem cut shorter in the waist so that I have to pull them up every time I stand up. Also, the denim seems of much lighter weight material to which I attribute the splitting in the crotch area. 501's used to be made in the USA with very heavy weight denim but these are sewn in Honduras and feel like cheap copies of real Levis. Used to love the fit and wear of 501's but guess I am going to have to try and find a new brand of jeans. Makes me sad as these used to be a great American-made product."
2,yuck,"I have some older levi's that I have just starting wearing again after losing weight. They were made in the U.S.A. They are made better, fit better and of higher quality. The one's that I have boughten that were made outside the U.S.A., are like stretch pant's. After I've had them on for a couple hours, the waist is an inch or more larger than when I put them on, as well as the rest of the levi's. I love my 501's, so am know wearing my old one's instead of my new one's because they fit so much better. The old one's are at least 15 years old, most are older than that. The other thing is they move their manufactoring out of the U.S.A., so they are less expensive to make, but the price has never gone down!!! Just the quality!!!"
3,It is Stainless Steel.,"This is a stainless steel stove but the stainless used is very thin and the knobs are all plastic. It worked perfectly on our camping excursions last summer but I always worry about the knobs and it being dented up or lid tweaked. For the money it should have been just a little better I felt, for the same money I could have bought a Coleman Product that was more sturdy. For the weekender this is a great product but for the enthusiest one good smack in the front and you'd better plan on using vice grips."
3,The Dorm That Dripped Mediocrity,"The Dorm That Dripped Blood is an early eighties slasher movie that has its moments. It's okay, but I swear it brings nothing original to the table whatsoever. It lacks the oomph that carried most of the movies in the Friday the 13th series and the Halloween series. And for my money, even Terror Train is better. Also, the DVD is pretty grainy in a lot of scenes. For slasher completists, only."
2,Nice Pictures-Bad Guide,"Everyone I know that does Asian timber framing or furniture has this book...so it is not a bad book, just not the book most really use most of the time. I share it as a ""picture book,"" for layfolk that just want to look at nice photography. Most in the craft of cutting Asian joinery, (that don't speak/read the languages,) us ""Wood Joints in Classical Japanese Architecture,"" by Torashichi Sumiyoshi and Gengo Matsui. This is an English language cut manual of many of the Asian, and of course Japanese, joinery that you find in the architecture and furniture of those regions. Any timber wright would benefit from this book in there library."
5,jeep carrier,I was looking at the baby bjorn but my daughter called me and told me about this product so I bought this instead for her baby coming in June. Very prompt service.
5,Must Have Series From Alligator,"Alligator Records hit it right on the head when they named this series, ""crucial"". Yes this series is a crucial must have for any Blues fan, especially if you're a new comer to the Blues sound. I myself had a limited knowledge when I purchased this CD, but this CD changed that quickly. This CD starts off with a cornball version of a swing tune called ""She Walks Right In"", but about half way through the tune Clarence Gatemouth Brown throws in an awesome guitar solo that foretells the rest of the CD. This CD introduces the listener to one great Blues artist after another and most have that awesome brass section that makes great blues performances seem even better. Notables on this CD include Albert Collins, Robert Cray, and Johnny Copeland, whom all perform together, Long John Hunter, W.C. Clark, Floyd Dixon and Delbert McClinton. I strongly recommend this CD and all the Crucial Blues CDs not only to new comers but all blues fans."
1,Myopic,"This is the story of the murder of Sharon Wilcox by her estranged boyfriend Jose Esquibel. It is told only through the eyes of his defense attorney, and does not give any insight whatsoever into the terror and agony faced by Sharon's mother, or her children as this madman held them all at gunpoint to witness Sharon's murder. The story seems much like the author is off on a bad acid trip, as he waivers back and forth through his own melancholia to extol his own virtues, those of the murderer, the cheapness of true justice, and all the while ignoring the reality of a young woman's tragic and needless death."
5,Your boombox better form a union...,"...'cuz Redman keeps the circuits overworked (from ""Whateva Man"").Redman - Muddy Waters (Def Jam, 1996)Though I listened to Redman ever since EPMD's ""Headbanger"" (where he was introduced to the world), this is the first album I bought from him. I recently dug this album out, listened to it again and it still sounds great. This album contains Redman's best lyrics and Erick Sermon's best beats, and truthfully, this is the last album that either one of them would sound THIS good. As any Redman fan will know, finding the best lyric is a hard task because every lyric on this album is tight. Even Jamal (now known as Mally G.) raps well on ""Da Ill Out"". This is also the last album where those pesky WDEF radio skits would be entertaining and worth rewinding. If you're only used to the ""I'll Bee Dat""-type Redman (which is not a bad thing), then I advise you to pick this album up and keep your finger next to the rewind button at all times. -EJR"
2,Not his best but not bad,"This Cd misses the mark of excellence that usually is the trademark of one of our greatest if not THE greatest vocalist we have. His clear, honest and powerful range sets him apart in a world of average Joes. Two songs stand out on this CD that join his long list of classics. Wrap your arms around me and Someone to Love are the 2 and while some make like the other songs on this CD since he doesn't know how to sing bad, the songs just are lacking the style or the heart and soul Engelbert usually pours into his phrasing and powerful delivery."
2,Dissapointed,"I've read all the praise and reviews for this classic Frank Miller run on Daredevil. I tried hard to like it but in the end I was highly dissapointed. These stories have aged badly (unlike the first three Spider-Man essentials which DESERVE to be a '60s pop culture entity). I'm a fan of Miller's Batman: Year One and I'm a fan of Loeb's Daredevil: Yellow. Too bad this failed to strike the charisma that does two graphics conveyed. If you're new to the medium, grab those two but approach Daredevil Visionaries 2 with an unbiased caution."
3,Quality not there!,"My son LOVES this toy, but I have to keep putting it together! The legs fall out of the hole every time you try to use the elevator and the piece that folds down always falls off with little force. It would be great if it stayed together!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"We bought this toy yesterday and we are returning it immediately. This is what my 4 year old son says, ""I don't love this toy. It is really bad because when you try to lift it, the zip cord falls out. And when you move the elevator up, the vehicle falls out (the whole house shakes.) I CAN'T EVEN LIFT THE ELEVATOR. I am angry about the toy. We want to return the toy back NOW!!!!."""
4,Son Loves It Even Though He Asks For Alicia,"I've been reading the reviews on this toy AFTER buying it. LOL. Yes, I'm awful about buying a toy and then reading its reviews. However, I purchased this set at a yard sale for an awesome price so I'm very pleased. I just wanted to add how funny it is that many of the reviews request an Alicia figure to be added to the set. The first thing my son said when pulling out the pieces to put this together is, ""Where is Alicia?"" So apparently he thinks Alicia should be a part of this set as well!As for the problem with the zip line falling off constantly, what I did was just tape the zip line at the top so it would stay on. This seems to have worked very well. It also helps keep the shed at the bottom from falling over when Diego comes down the line.This is a nice toy, and if you find it cheap at a yard sale or consignment shop I say go for it. However, I think if you were to purchase at retail price in the store, you would be disappointed."
3,If your child likes Diego...,"My son loves Diego! So, when I saw this I had to get it for him. He enjoys playing with it. He has most of the Diego toys. The rescue center doesn't really do much. My son (2 years old) calls it Diego's house. Mostly he plays with the animals on the rescue center. The ""elevator"" thing on it is hard to work. But, the helicopter and ATV are fun to play with. So, if your child is a Diego fan, then you should get this."
3,WHERE IS ALICIA?!?,"My son got this for his third birthday and has spent two weeks obsessing over it. If he tries to pick it up to change locations it falls apart, but is really easy to reassemble, I wish the legs locked in though. The cord and helicopter usually require my help, but overall he plays alone with this toy longer than with any other he's ever had. He's creating great stories, BUT WHERE IS ALICIA?!? It's the only item on his letter to Santa and I can't find her anywhere. Why make her part of the show and then produce a million animals from each episode and not an important charater? ARRGGGHHH!!!"
5,Very Good,I think this one of the best CDs I've ever listened to. It's a good collection of the great hits he had.
2,"terrific album, thats why it gets 2 stars (im picky)","if your a big ll cool j fan you will love this album its got all his hits hey lover with boys 2 men, mama said knock you out, doin it, and many more. i strongly suggest you get this album if you are an ll cool j fan. im really happy that all them child molestation charges against him were dropped so that he can continue to make great music"
2,Not fantastic,"There were only four songs which i loved on this album: Loungin' (with Total), the one with Boyz 2 men, Ain't nobody and doin' it. I need love was definetly the worst song along with I can't live without my radio. Well i'll tell you something Mr LL Cool J. If songs like that are going to be played on my radio i definetly can live without my radio! This album was obviously a mistake and i hope that LL Cool J can make material which is worthy of purchasing. Very dissapointing."
2,Light on depth,"This book is mostly a picture book (and the pictures aren't that great) with little information. Having spent time in all of these towns, the pictures do not do justice. Also, the author concentrates on towns that are full of tour buses and very unpleasant - especially during season. There are so many more hill towns in Umbria and Tuscany that are more out of the way and charming. I guess I should be greatful that they weren't disclosed so that they stay less touristy!"
4,Good Book for Young kids,"I used its old version for my son to do journal.Now , I am using the new version for my daughter.I like the old one better, but the new version oneis good enough for my kid to learn about sentense anddo some drawing. They all like these books."
3,Twice the price...,of L'eggs and same quality. Got a run the first day. Thought they might last a little longer.
4,"Innovative, VERY funny","Whether or not you like R Kelly's music you gotta admit, this is something we've never seen before. Its a soap opera, music video, stage play, and R&B musical rolled into one. The acting is very good. R Kelly acted surprisingly well as the old man and the pimp. There are some hilarious moments. There is a huge cliffhanger at the end"
4,need more,I liked the DVD. Can u please let me know when the next chapters are available I need to know what the package is.
2,"I hope it gets better, next time.","It was good, but this 12 to 22 chapters lost the music part of it. Before you would but able to play it on your cd player and really enjoy it. Now it looks like he made this just for dvd. It's not the same as the 1st 1 to 12 chapters and not better either. I'm only looking forward to seeing the next chapters in order to see if he went back to the old way."
5,PERFECT!,"Exactly what my husband was looking for! Works great! Great for all ages, my kids love to use it too!"
5,Cash machine,"Best book on Theory of Constraints since ""The Goal."" I bought a copy for each of my managers and made this the topic of our last meeting."
2,"Oh, hum...","If you like music cliched, insepid, and over-produced, this is the one for you. I was very disappointed in this recording. It is very ""commercial"" with nothing memorable or inventive. The producer was a ""Cosby"" with a few songs by a ""Cosby."" The disco-tinged first track sets up the entire recording. It never really gets any better. I gave it two stars because...it's a ""fair"" recording. Had I to do it over, I'd pass on this one. I'll probably never play it again. There's too much good BS&T to listen to (Although I WILL put it ahead of Nuclear Blues)."
2,Not their best movie,"My two daughters and I love the Wiggles. We own about 20 DVDs, almost every one they've made. This is the only one we are not a fan of. It's just weird. My 3 year old kept asking where the Wiggles were. She didn't understand that they were animated wiggles. There is too much goofy story and not enough singing and dancing."
1,$24.49...For A DVD-R?! NO WAY!,"I remember enjoying this film when I'd catch it on TV during the '60's in Chicago IL. I was excited to see it had been released on DVD but a perusal of the details denotes another bird entirely. This is a DVD-R, the cheap kissing cousin of a DVD and Amazon.com supplies a note stating it may not play on devices other than a straight forward DVD player. I think a price tag of no more than $12 would be appropriate. Until that day, expect this item to fly off the shelves like Obama buttons at a Republican tea party."
3,The Movie is Better!,"Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates was a good book, but a lot of it is too much like a reference book, which is not something I care to read on my free time. If you want to find out a little about this book, watch Brink! on Disney - a 1990s movie roughly based on the book. You will most likely enjoy the movie much more because it is general fun...and I promise...no reference books involved."
2,How good of a representation is this?,"Ok, so I haven't bought this album - and odds are, I won't. So, you might be asking yourself why I'm writing a negative review. Well, two of my favorite artists are Ryan Adams and Wilco. I have the albums the two songs here are from, and these are two of the weakest songs on each album. So, while I love hearing great new music, I'm wondering how good of a sampling I'm really getting from the other artists also. I'm very disapointed with the songs they chose from the artists I know, so I'll skip this in the fear that the other artists are also misrepresented."
5,Great for parties!,"If you sold your N64, you made an unfortunate mistake. Not only did this system have two games that were arguably two of the greatest, it also had a great multiplayer series called Mario Party. Thankfully, it is continuing on the Gamecube. Each one has a strength, and in the second one, it's the minigames. There are updates on 20 classics, like Bumper Balls, Shy Guy Says, and Desert Dash, along with 40 all- new ones, like Shell Shocked, Archer Rival, and- my favorite new one- Honey Comb Havoc. You have 6 players (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, Donkey Kong, and Yoshi), 6 boards (Pirate Land, Western Land, Mystery Land, Space Land, Horror Land, and Bowser Land), each with a duel and item minigame that suits them, and plenty-o-fun. If you're looking for a series of 4 player bashes, then look for these four games."
5,GOOD TIMES WITH THE MARIO GANG 9.25 OUT OF 10,"I can honestly say that this game is better than Mario Party 3, because the sequels just don't have the same level fun as the second iteration. Playing with a friend with this game never ever gets old(that's why I like retro Nintendo games). The mini-games are still great to play and are very entertaining and hilarious at times, the graphics look nice still, the characters are still awesome, the environments are still cool, the challenges are still fun, and it's still satisfying to win the cup. I'm very sad to see the current state of the franchise and how it's not settling with critics, it's very shameful that Nintendo seems to be doing nothing to help save this franchise, and seem more focused on selling Wiis than having quality games."
1,The Game is Broken :(,When I first got the game I was so excited to play it. So i went over my fully functional N64 and put it in and the game didn't work at all. It didn't even show me a loading screen :(.Mario Party 2
2,Don't use beyond undergraduate education!,"This is an undergraduate text -- extremely basic -- on Abnormal Child Psychology, but it does not provide much in terms of helpful information beyond explaining the basics of some childhood disorders. It may be a fine introduction for those beginning to learn about abnormal psych (although even then, I'd recommend something a bit more advanced, if the population is above Freshman level in College), but it certainly is not written for those studying childhood disorders at a clinical level. There are no ""norm-references"" or ""developmental milestones"" charts/tables/etc. There is very little substantial information beyond what one might get in a basic abnormal psychology text or a general psych text.The upshot: if using for undergrads, use caution. If using for graduate-level courses, DON'T."
5,Back Pain be Gone...,"Awesome product. Works better than anything else we have tried for lower back pain. Also, the trippy 70's video style, haircuts, leotards and bad visual effects only add to the overall enjoyment. Seriously though - this really works!"
3,critiques sur la maniere de danser de FOXY.,"j ai l habitude de regarder quelques clipss de FOXY,ma foi elle danse comme rien du tout ,ferait mieux d ameliorer ses pas de danse avec le beat de la musique !!c est carrement nul!!!"
3,This album is too short,"There's only a couple of songs on here I like, particularly the one with Prodigy from Mobb Deep. Her rapping about money, men and sex gets pretty tired fast. But this is her first album; she has plenty of room for improvement!"
5,Laugh out loud hilarious!,"This was honestly the greatest book I have ever read. I laughed out loud after reading practically every page. If I were stranded on a desert island and had only one book, I would want Youth in Revolt to be it."
5,An adults-only kid biography!,This book was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. This kid had more angles than a protractor! My hero!
5,"The best book in a very, very long time...","this is the greatest teenage novel ever written. it was given to my by a dear friend when her brother returned home from college, and i was immediately drawn into it. i loved the characters; flawed as they were, their hilarity made me feel for them. farfetched as most of the plot twists were, the humor made them seem plausible, if not downright realistic. it worked so well, in fact, that i became so absorbed that my schoolwork suffered because i would read it in class and after school, instead of doing work. sadly though, my copy (the one i borrowed) has been passed on, so i must wait until the one i ordered arrives in the mail..."
3,"""Watch your smart mouth!""","I picked up ""Youth in Revolt"" at the used bookstore and paid two dollars for it. I'm kind of glad now that I did. Don't get me wrong--Nick (the narrator) is a witty smart aleck, and his journal is very entertaining. I have to admit I laughed. A lot. The author has a scathing sense of humor. But that being said, Nick's not all that likeable. In his obsessive quest to be with the woman of his dreams (Sheeni), he manipulates everyone around him. He kind of reminds me of a miniature military strategist. He's got a goal in mind (it's the same goal, my husband says, that every 14 year old boy has in mind), and he'll do whatever he has to do to achieve it. Even when he's burned down half of Berkeley, framed the local football star, or led an accomplice to attempt suicide, he shows no shred of remorse.It's a fun book, I won't lie. And you'll love Nick's smart mouth. Just don't expect to like Nick."
3,14 year olds who sound 40,"This is by far one of the funniest books I have ever come across and while I enjoyed reading it immensely there were numerous plot holes that cannot be ignored, from Nick and his friends considering virginity at 14 archaic to the way they speak to some of the events which ensue in the novel being absolutely ludicrous and implausable. Even still it was a very funny and very well paced read; I'd like to see more from C.D. Payne."
5,What more can I say: HILARIOUS from start to finish.,"If there was ever a more brutally honest and frank novel about coming-of-age this is it. There is never a dull moment in the diary of the eternally horny Nick Twisp, whose sentiments on growing up in the nineties are as outrageous and funny as his pursuit of Sheenie Saunders. For sheer entertainment value, this book should keep you hooked for years. There's a little Nick Twisp in all of us."
2,Not the best out there...,"I found this book very disturbing. Some parts where funny but all in all it wasn't what I expected. I don't think this was a very good interpritation of a teenagers life. Not all male teens are over hormonial like Nick (The Protagonist) and not all teen lives revolve around sex. Reading this book made me feel as if I was reading something illegal, it made me feel somewhat like a pedofile. It seemed as if everyother sentence contained some kind of sexual reference, as if all that was in the protagonists life was sex, which got boring after the first 28 pages. It also seemed like the only people enjoying this book in my school where mostly girls/wemon, while the other gender found it a bit disturbing. This book seems more for younger, maybe middle school, or early high school students, but not something I would recomend to older readers. There where some funny parts, but all togeather I believe it is not something I would recomend/ buy."
2,Overrated,"This book is a fast, easy read. Nothing more. For this to receive five stars is ridiculous. It's a sometimes entertaining, readable book, yes. But, by no means, is it great. I mean, everyone praises the book's humor. ""I laughed out loud,"" everyone says. Well, I didn't. The book tries too hard to be funny, to be shocking, and, to me, the humor just seemed too easy, aimed for junior high kids. Sure, at points, Nick Twisp is amusing, but he's hardly some great literary character. Don't believe the praise. The book just isn't that good."
5,"Wildly unusual, funny, irreverent, and great!","If you have a wild sense of humor, were ever a teenager, and love well-crafted writing that takes you to places and into lives that you have never imagined this book will become one of your favorites. This is one of those rare books that is nothing like any other book you have read and yet will hold your interest from page one to the end."
1,sorry SARA......,"We (Michelle and i) are gonna stop you !! NO MATTA WHAT IT TAKEZ; We'll stop you!!Oh, and YOU shouldnt buy My Scene:Reasons:They are copies (TOTAL COPIES!!!!!!!!) OF BRATZ!THEY ARE UGLY; NO REAL SENSE OF FASHION.(...)So, live with it! Hahaha!Alisa Leigh Jones - from U.K!"
5,checking for messages chelsea churro?,I really like this doll she is so pretty . I love her hair i would get her but my birhtday is coming so i will waiT. you sure like my scene actually so do i hoow old are you going to be anyway? SEE ya later!
5,myscenes are cool bratze drool!,myscene look like real teens.they have cool hair strikes and awsome clothes.but on the other hand bratz have heads that are huge and big lips....ew. just stop the doll war there both fine dolls.
3,"Nice toy, but...","This toy is a beautiful toy and a great idea. My daughter loves it. This was the toy that I got by way of replacement because the first toy did not sing.I have two criticisms and one comment. The criticisms are that the toy is not as user friendly for a toddler as I would wish. The material covering the mechanism to activate the toy does not fit snuggly over it, so the child will press the right place but the toy will not respond. I usually have to feel for the mechanism. The second criticism is that the toy is advertised as a 'plush' toy but you can feel the hardware when you hug it. Designers must remember that the children don't love the toy soley because it sings and spins, but also because its Pablo from their favourite show.The comment is merely to indicate that you need to put the toy in the middle of a 6x6 area for it to move and dance without bumping into anything. It no big deal though.If they could work out the kinks it would be a very good toy."
3,Doesn't 'work' all the time,"My 18 month old daughter was initially quite taken with Pablo. However, he doesn't always work properly. Sometimes he just stops in the middle of his song and dance routine and the toy makes an odd grinding sound - not sure if that is normal. We've only had Pablo for about a month now."
3,Doodlebug,"overall the bike is good for the money. IF YOU ARE NOT HANDY...THINK BEFORE YOU BUY. we have had to adjust the chain a number of times, which includes sliding the engine forward, also had a few other minor problems. my Bigest complain is the shipping container. the box was torn and looked like it had been run over. clearly not much thought goes into what they ship these bikes in. a fun bike."
5,Progressive British Blues,"After Scratching The Surface, this is a big step toward progressive blues/rock. Though pure blues still dominates, you can tell a big difference in structure and tone from the previous album.I have several favorite cuts but the stand-outs are Natchez Burning and Mistreated. Throughout the album, Tony McPhee stretches and jams. I am still amazed that he was using a Gibson SG and does not use a pick. His tone sounds an awful lot like he is using a Fender.Since I tend to compare everything the Groundhogs do to Who Will Save The World, in Blues Obituary, I can hear plenty of traces of what was to come. This is great stuff and I highly recommend it."
4,waydown Natchez Mississippi,A very good lp. Tony is now included on blues collections reflecting his deep understanding of the Delta. Later Hogs albums became more philosphical but this is a tribute to hard core blues. Natchez is the heavy on the lp.
2,Blitz Rhino Ramp 8000,"These ramps are not worth the money. They work ok if you can get your car on them. When I try to drive on the ramps with my F150, they just slip on the concrete floor. They have a rubber plug that is designed to stop the slip but they just ripped out on me. I'm going to try glueing the rubber plugs in and see how that works."
3,poor rubber feet,"I have two vehicles; a car and SUV (Explorer). No problem with weight. But the feet regularly fall off the ramps. Even with the rubber feet on, the ramps slide on the smooth driveway floor and it can take a few attempts to get your car up the ramp. I have to rig it up so it doesn't slide. A little disappointing."
3,Good ramps for car oil changes,Originally bought these for use in changing my oil myself. They work well for front wheel drive / 4 wheel drive vehicles. Otherwise they want to slide instead of staying put to drive up on. Based on all the info I thought these would be easily able to work for my Ford F-150 but if I was doing it again I'd buy the heavier model for the truck. They are nice and light weight for carrying around but they do not work well on any surface other than something solid like a concrete garage floor. For example if you have a gravel driveway and prefer to change your oil on the driveway you will want a different product. The composite material is open on the bottom such that on gravel they don't stay up on top like they need to. Good product if you are just needing something for a car in your concrete floored garage. Made in the USA which is always a plus in my book.
4,Rhino ramps work fine - don't lose the feet,"I bought these today to raise my Chrysler minivan. They worked great, drove right up. The plastic worried me so I put jack stands under the frame for additional support. Belt and suspenders sort of thing...but probably overkill. Keep track of the rubber feet. They are not attached, but just slide in. They fall off when you store the ramps and you might not notice."
4,Blitz Rhino Ramp 8000,"Great product to lift my Nissan Versa another 6 inches to get underneath. They do the job, but the construction is alittle liteweight(some sort of hollow structured plastic/polycarbonate). Recommended only for light compact cars with narrow tires. Would recommend the Rhino Ramp 12000 if they were less expensive than $59.00, maybe more like $39.00."
2,Do your Shopping locally before ordering.,"Unfortunately I thought it was a good price and free shipping, but not the case. Found same ramps at local auto parts store cheaper. Even with sales tax I would have saved a few dollars."
1,Look elsewhere...,"I agree with the previous review. Seemingly comprehensive but how do you get through it? Very poorly written. Compare his writing skills to Paul McFedries, for example, an excellent writer. A better book on the Win 98 Registry has to be out there."
3,"Okay to display, not much fun otherwise","Because of the ""pop-up"" feature this model has, the movement and poseability is a bit limited. When you push in on its ""nose"", it ""springs up"" thru the use of rubber bands. As you can imagine, it rarely lands on its feet, and also does not really compact as well as it does in the movie. The model does stand by itself, but not very well. HOWEVER, a very nice bonus of this kit is that it comes with instructions to make a really cool speeder biker (from ""ROTJ"") from the same parts. I enjoy the speeder bike a lot and it makes a nice display and play piece."
5,Great toy!,"Well, I'm a big Star Wars fan, and a Lego fan, and take it from me, this is one of the best Star Wars Lego toys out there. It's simple yet it does so much! It's one the most accurate of the Star Wars Lego toys I own! It's easy, yet not too easy that you get bored with it. It gives instructions to build two models.It's pretty durable, it's not the strongest, but it should hold up nicely!I highly recommend this item, to Star Wars and Lego fans alike!Good show!"
4,Could have used an editor,"Are there no editors anymore? After I'd sat down with the book for less than half an hour I found numerous items that any competent editor would have found, errors that are reminiscent of what happens if I write something at three in the morning and don't check it again after getting a good nights' sleep. I found similar problems in the Sherry bio. There is an interesting book here, but the final product lacks the touch that a good editor could have lent the work."
3,Worth $10,What do you want for $10? It is a windbreaker to toss in the trunk or golf bag just in case
3,"Attractive, Well-Made Windbreaker. No Great Bargain Here.","I received two jackets days earlier than committed. The sky blue and navy colors were more muted and thus more attractive than I anticipated. I would call this a windbreaker rather than a jacket as it would mainly serve to break the wind or offer some rain protection more than offer warmth on a chilly day. I somehow pictured a thicker fabric though upon rereading the ad saw that there was no misrepresentation in any way. The jacket seems to be well made and is comfortably and spaciously sized. If you want a nicely made windbreaker, buy this. If you need something a little more substantial, look for better values in other offerings."
2,Not a great value,"I ordered this product because I was travelling to California and did not have a jacket. I am a big guy, and although I ordered a 5xl the jacket rode up over my belly in the front among my other issues with this garment, which are:* It is too thin - no liner (buy this just to have a jacket on..it is literally too thin to ""break the wind"")* It is very expensive for what it is...* If you are a tall person as I am it was not long enough...2 to 4 inches would have served me well."
2,zipper tab is on left = woman's jacket,"the zipper tab is on the left side as per a woman;s jacket....tho this could be a unisex jacket in appearance save for the zipper issue. had it been so stated i would not have bought an added one for my husband...he finds the zipper tab being on the left an annoying inconvenience.the jacket otherwise is well made.an added, however... the company low-balls the shipping date, ours arrived well after that low-ball date."
2,Finish wore out,"After only 3 years the finish near the end of the spout wore entirely through, I was simplly going to replace it with another reliable brand but the oringal shut offs were located too far away for any other brand because the supply tubes are extra long on this unit. Kohler gave me a hard time on the phone claiming that it had to be cleanser related even though we only used paper towels. Anyway, I was glad to see that unit is still available through Amazon so I'll just swap it out and move on."
3,Looks nice but it's a piece of junk.,"Kohler makes a very easy to install faucet but the barrel is made of such thin metal that it begins to warp the minute you try to remove the aerator. Let me tell you, King Arthur had it easy with the sword in the stone. This aerator was forged in fires of Mordor and screwed on by seven ninja terminators. I watched Red Dawn and screamed ""wolverines"" as I tried to remove this damned, cursed aerator. I cried, I laughed, I called on all the powers I know and still nothing. When I asked Satan for help in exchange for my soul, he refused. REFUSED.So far, Kohler has said that they will replace it. But I'm wary from now on. The barrel material is too thin. It's just not one of their solid faucets."
4,Best of the 2,"Garner made 2 movie for disney. if your on the look out for good family movie that are fun, no cursing or nudity, a little action and a little romance... you want Castaway Cowboy, CC not One Little Indian, OLI.CC is a nice movie about a cowboy that ends up stuck on an island. He shows the nice widow woman how to start a cattle ranch instead of tring to far or fish.OLI is very boring. Not one of my three kids stayed for the end. And isn't that the true test of a movie. It isn't totally what mom or I like, it is also what they will like enough to sit and watch and enjoy."
1,Sent it back,"The movie wouldn't play. It wanted the region changed to 2 or 4, but would only accept 1 for the United States and Canada. The public shouldn't have to change the region on a DVD. It should just play."
1,the castaway cowboy,"what i would liked to have known about this dvd is where is had been originally sold. as in, the dvd that we received was sold in denmark, which means we could not view it on our dvd player because of a region code error."
5,memory stick pro duo purchase,I received this product on perfect condition and so far it has been working fine. Good quality product.
2,Not so much,"I wanted a program to help me document my ""new"" yard. I became a Master Gardener to learn how to do the yard and bought the program to record it. The program was more work than the yard (and it is a significant yard) It is limited, convoluted and took up so much space in my computer that it made my other computer tasks more difficult. I removed the program."
3,Time consuming,"The landscaping software has a steep learning curve, and it's somewhat difficult to navigate. It took me hours to try and build my back yard, and when all was said and done, it didn't seem worth it. This product seems well suited for people who will use this software for a business, not a personal yard project. It's too complex for the average homeowner who just wants a simple and quick application."
3,Decent but not great,"I have mixed feelings about this software. On one hand, it's a bunch of fun to play around with your landscaping and this software does a great job of allowing you to put virtually anything in your yard and then view it in either 2D or 3D. There's a ton of plants and yard ""stuff"" to use. The interface is fairly easy to understand and use. Where I lose some interest is, I found the feature to duplicate your house and yard fairly difficult. The concept of putting a picture in and the program using that didn't work well. That part of the software was pretty disappointing for me as you really want to see your actual house in the plans."
2,Too difficult,"The learning curve for this software was way too long. I was looking for easy: show me a ranch and let me drag and drop ""actual"" plants in front of it, not some convoluted program without common names of plants, etc. Not for the casual user."
4,Flesh-N-Jam,"Flesh-N-Bone released his debut solo album on Def Jam back in 1996 to great applause. His ""World So Cruel"" with Reverend Run remains one of my favorite tracks to this day. Has an overall great appeal to his listeners and features Big Pun when he was relatively unknown."
5,Very handy,"As a golfer that plays every day, it has extended my season well into December so far. I had an older one that I had to turn off every time that I got out of the cart because of the fear of fire because of its open flame. This model, though more expensive, heats very well and is more like a regular car heater. Not only that, but I turn it down and the propane lasts about 3 full rounds."
5,Perfect,Works great but put a coozy on the bottom to make it fit tighter in cup holder. I would buy again
4,This works but it smells a bit...,"We have an enclosure for our cart. When we use this it makes our clothes smell a bit. I wouldn't use this driving to a place where that would be an issue, but I sure would use it driving home because it really works!"
4,heater,I have used heater twice. It work fine but it is top heavy. I had to bungy it to the golf cart. It will not stay in cup holder alone. I am glad I bought it.
5,Great heater,Bought this heater for our golf cart because we live adjacent to the golf course and drive the cart in the winter time to the club house. Love the electric push button starter and the unit heats up rapidly. We have no problem taking the cart with curtains down and heater on even in low twenty degree weather. This was a great buy and I would definitely recommend to anyone.
1,junk,"This item appeared and was compared to a better made copy, but it did not identify this one as the bad one. It will function, but is very poorly made and expectations of longevity and function are low."
1,a really cheap made soldering helper,"i advice anyone who is about to buy this thing because of the price, not to. the thing is obviously super cheap. the quality is beyond poor, way beyond. spend an extra 5 dollars and get something that's not as bad."
2,Keep Looking,"I bought this hoping to use it to hold a medium sized circuit board for soldering on some components. It is very difficult to adjust and the base is small and flimsy. The clamp arms won't tighten up enough to hold anything without bracing it against something. Might work for tying flies or something, but if you're looking for a clamp to hold anything heavier than a few feathers you'd be better off with something else."
3,"It's decent, but hard to adjust","These helping hands work, and I do use them daily, but it's a trial. The wing nuts don't hold anything tightly enough unless you tighten them with pliers, the magnifying lens is difficult to maneuver, and the base isn't heavy enough.Bottom line: it's the thrift store price, don't expect name-brand quality."
1,Don't use this vendor,"Can't say....never got the order (has been over a month) and no response when I inquire....Don't use this vendor, buy it someplace else..."
4,Great but older computer animation,"Great story, but the animation may be wonky for some since we are all so use to Pixar now, but your kids will love it."
4,"BAYSIDE GOES ACOUSTIC, AND IT WORKS.","I've always been a sucker for a good acoustic set. So I decided to give this new release a shot, since I have been enjoying Bayside's work so far. Suprisingly enough, these Bayside songs do transfer well into acoustic format.""They Looked Like Strong Hands"" would have to be the highlight of the album. The song's stripped down performance brings a new demention of feeling to it.Recommended to fans of Bayside, and those who appreciate the ""unplugged"" style."
5,"4.6 stars, Pretty Tight","Richie Rich comes out strong on his '96 album ""Seasoned Veteran."" It is good music to lowride to. ""Funk""(#2) has a really hard-core beat and excellent rhyming. ""Let's Ride"" (#4), is a funky anthem about the Cali rider mentality! Of course, 2Pac's appearance in ""N---az Done Changed"" (#9), paired with a menacing beat and Richie Rich's hard, but laconic rhyming, makes it a hit. He rep's the Oaktown to the fullest."
3,A good read,This is an excellent first book - it's not up to the standard of Pérez-Reverte - but it's a thoroughly good read.
3,old english mystery,"I enjoy reading both English history and fictional murder mysteries. I thought this book would bring both of my interests together in a delightful read. I do enjoy the history presented, especially regarding the changing religious direction in England after their breaking away from the Pope in the early 1500's. I am a bit disappointed in the character development. I find it to be a little slow in getting established, but I am 60% through and I find myself looking forward to a surprise ending. At this point, I have no idea who the criminal is; and that certainly adds to the suspense!"
4,Detective Story set in 1537,Mathew Shardlake is a lawyer/detective in King Henry's England. The story is a crime novel written in the English of today. It is easy to read and lovely to see what it was like in the non royal life of the general public. His written English is excellent and he is obviously very knowledgeable about that era.I am on to my third novel by this gent and am hoping he will quickly write more! Great book.
4,Dissolution,Great book. Interesting in it's history as well as the story telling. I will read more of the Matthew Shardlake Misteries
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"We bought this for my 2 year old daughter. After putting it together, the clock didn't work on ours either. My husband and I took the bottom of the desk apart. When you push the clock in, it pushes an electronic piece down which is why it doesn't work. After putting it all back together, it worked fine for two days. Now only two buttons on the clock work. To get the music to play, we had to shove something down next to the top of the desk to make sure it kept playing. I will be contacting Fisher-Price, this toy is not worth the money."
1,Christmas Disappointment :(,"Just like all of the other reviewers, ours has the same problems and does not work. After a long assembly, we found out the buttons on the clock do not work. The instruments don't work either. My son really loved it and kept trying to play with it so, hope FP can fix the problem. Returning it tomorrow and not buying another one until they iron out the problems."
2,Want a cheaply made boring toy?? Buy This!! :(,I purchased this toy for my 2 yr old nephew's birthday because he loves anything with lights and music. The price was 55.00 but using my 2 Amazon coupons made it a FREE toy with free shipping. While I am disappointed with the toy I guess for free I can't complain although I could have used the coupons for something that he would actually play with :( This is a large toy which takes up space and is rarely used. He is now 3 and the toy has dust on it. The only thing he has ever done with it is bang on the piano. The clock works fine on this one so I cant comment on everyone else's problem with that. While it was fairly simple to put together it is a flimsy thin plastic cheaply made toy that is not worth the price. There are many other educational toys out there that your child will actually use.
5,Awesome Comfort!,This pillow has been everything everyone said. It's supportive and comfortable. I have purchased many pillows to support my neck and head and none of them have been as high quality of a product as this pillow!
2,Wasn't impressed,"I purchased this pillow from my Chiropractor, but was not impressed with it at all. I tried varying levels of water in it, but my orthopedic pillow I had was much better (for me) than this one. I would not waste my money on another Chiroflow pillow. To me, this pillow is way over-rated."
2,Vastly over-rated,"I am a huge Evelyn Waugh fan--A Handful of Dust, Put Out More Flags, and Brideshead Revisited are among my favorite novels of all time. But this book just doesn't work. It seems a mishmash of different parts and seems haphazardly, even lazily written. Waugh seems to get bored of his protagonist Guy Crouchbook toward the end and dumps him to follow other characters, characters recently introduced to us and who we don't particularly care about. Although the Crete scenes are nicely done, we just want to get them over with. This book isn't half as good as the first part of the trilogy and, I hate to say it, if it wasn't Waugh it would almost certainly not be in print today."
1,The Twilight Zone: 40th Anniversary Collection,"I have just auditioned this CD set, and the sound is awful, it's poorly mastered. What [person] thought that adding cheesy echo would cover the fact that it was not mastered from session tapes. I will buy nothing from this label again. It sounds like a bootleg. The harshness of my criticism is directed toward the producers of this disk, as both the TV show, and scores are brilliant. The Varese Sarabande Twilight Zone collections (Volume 1 & 2) on CD or Vinyl are sonically superior, and constitute a fitting example of these fine scores."
3,"Be careful, Jerky...","Jerky fans beware - this is not a CD full of 98 new calls. There are 6 new calls, and 92 voicemail/ringtone-related bits that, at best, highlight past jerky calls. Some might get you to smirk, but don't expect to split a gut at these. I love the JB's, so I got a hold of this regardless. Hardcore fans might do the same. I am sad to see that this time around, it's just Johnny and his trademark characters making an appearance. I did hear about the split between Johnny and Kamal a while back - I suppose they never really reconciled. Or just not to my knowledge. (After some searching around, I see Kamal also released a solo effort - ""Once a Jerk, Always a Jerk"")All that said - the calls that are on here are pretty funny. You'll find yourself listening to these the most, and skipping over the rest after 1 or 2 plays."
5,Pure Thrashing Mayhem,"Nothing but pure thrashing mayhem here. Mandatory for fans of retro thrash like Dekapitator and Municipal Waste. They have a hard and metallik sound, reminding of Dark Angel and Terribly Certainty era Kreator. Cover art by Ed Repka, who made all the klassic covers for Megadeth and Nuclear assault, back in the day."
4,True Friendships,"This book explored the complexity of three professional women, who because of a common interest in a guy end there friendship. We see how each has tailored her life around this one guy. Somehow they realize that the friendship that they shared was more important than this guy, and begin to see what life is truely about. I would recommend this book to any women who at one point in her life has ended a friendship with someone that they miss, and wish they could start all over with that person."
2,Personal Opinon of Jim Meacock's soundtrack,"Ahh, I haven't bought the product, but from iplayer I've seen the documentary. I really cannot agree with this music, its difficult to discribe, but its not a subtle background tune.I can't really discribe why(I'm not musical) but its highly unconventional, and I guess this might polarise opinions."
3,Great taste and price but early expiration date,"My daughter loves this product and it becomes a little treat.The only reason I give only three stars here is because of the expiration date. When I ordered (April 09), the expiration date was about the end of July 09 (About 3 months away). I called the customer service but they said it is ""the freshest"" one. I don't know whether it is because they don't use preservetives or that is the freshest one in the Amazon warehouse. My husband helps eating them out now."
4,"Crumbly, Bumbly but altogether Humbly","The other day Mrs. Ulinov and I were wondering what the earth's best tots cereal bar cherry would be? And we also were wondering if it would come in a 5.4 oz size or a more manageable 5.3 oz unit.Lo and behold, the earth has declared these cereal bars to be THE BEST. I only wish they would come in pear-rasberry or blueberry-apple flavor....and they have an organic label on the box so it must help to keep the global temperature down."
4,Organic Cereal Bars,"Our 2.5 year old son loves these cereal bars. I love that they are organic. They are a bit small, but I feel confident when I give them to him that he is getting a relatively healthy snack to which he will not have an allergic reaction. (He broke out in mild hives when given a Nutragrain cereal bar.) He enjoys them, and they are a good go-to snack when we are short on time.Update: My son is now almost 39 months old and he no longer enjoys these bars. (I still have 3 boxes in my cupboard.) He stopped eating them in the last 4-6 months. I have tried them and I don't care for them, but my husband doesn't mind them. They were a great treat when our son was younger. Maybe he just got burnt out on them??"
3,the prettiest book from ever.,"This is wonderful!.. David's scottish dialect and colorful descriptions a la belle et sebastian scream through this work. It's so very absorbing and a pleasure to read. .. although, all that talk about his ""can, fork, and magnifying glass"" can be a little gross, at times. ...read it and you'll know what i mean."
3,Columbo fan critique,This was definitely the least entertaining season of the series. That of course is due to the ineffective writing. It is still good. Just not up to Columbo standards. Would still recommend if you are a fan. Next and final set surely makes up for this.
3,Only one turkey,"I'm a great fan of this television series. The Fifth Season is on the whole up to the very high standards displayed throughout. But one of the films is incredibly bad: ""Last Salute to the Commodore."" Indeed, it's a model of everything that can go bad. The script is awful, the acting is dreadful, and the directing (by actor Patrick McGoohan)is mind-boggling. Falk himself seems happily stoned throughout the film, and who could blame him."
5,Consistant Columbo,This is the latest in a series of Columbo seasons I have purchased. I enjoyed the shows when they were on TV and now I can relive them again. Service speed was very good ordering from Amazon.com.
1,Big Disappointment,"I have enjoyed the first four seasons of Columbo very much. Excellent stories and very enjoyable acting. Unfortunately, season five does not follow that same trend. The stories are trite and the acting is below par. Actors that performed very well in previous seasons episodes (Jack Cassidy, Robert Vaughn) seem to have become bored and unimpressed in this set. Even the maestro, Peter Falk, is below par. He has become bumbling and boring in most of these episodes. Also, it seems as though the stories were based on 30 minutes worth of ideas stretched out to 90 minutes. What happened? How could such a clever show change so dramatically? I felt season four was great. Maybe everyone was tired of doing it by season five. If this is what I have to look forward to in season six i won't be buying it."
1,Bootleg Garbage,"This dvd is a bootleg that ain't worth the powder to blow it to Hades. The makers of the DVD do not respect copyright laws and from the looks of the dvd they don't care about quality either. It's a dvd-r, by the way, and who want's to pay $25 for a copy? I am surprised AMAZON can't seem to get its act together in policing its own site."
3,On Richie Mason's Commens,"Before you take seriously what Richie Mason drops in his comments, put your mouse over his name, read his other comments. They all the same - like a carbon copy. He lies in his comments the reviewed product is a CD-R. Read tags to all his posted messages. He is not commenting on these products, he has his little personal war going. As I read more and more of his comments, seems, he is simply a sick man. Beware."
5,Excellent insight into Philadelphia's fascinating history.,This book is great read for anyone interested in Philadelphia or American history in general. I have lived in Philadelphia all my life and did not know half of the things that are presented in this book.It is filled with fascinating facts about this great city.Get this book today.
5,The City of Many Firsts!,"Philadelphia is still the city of many firsts. This book is delightful brief overlook of Philadelphia's many contributions to contemporary society. Of course, Benjamin Franklin has a lot to do with so many useful inventions. Of course, the 1876 World's Fair which also introduced us to the invention of the telephone and light bulbs. The inventions caught on just as Thomas Alva Edison and Bell are a part of our everyday lives. There is a lot more particularly in entertainment, cuisine, clothes, music, etc."
2,"did not receive u bolts, false advertisement","This company should be sued for advertising a product and dosent send whats advertised. I did not receive u bolts, only blocks. I will not recommend this company."
5,Excellent read for those starting to learn about Egypt,This is a great book for the well read scholar of Egypt or your average young reader looking to develop a deeper understanding of the Egyptian culture. This was the first book I read in my studies of Egypt and it left a taste in my mouth which I needed to satiate. My thanks to the author for a great read on a riveting topic.
4,Assuming this is the book I think it is...,"... there's insufficient information provided here to be certain, but judging by title, publisher and date of publication, this should be the text of three short plays by David Mamet, Elaine May and Woody Allen. I saw the plays and have since been hoping to come across a copy of Elaine May's brilliant sketch about a suicidal prostitute and a first-time volunteer at a suicide hotline. David Mamet's play was little more than a drawn-out joke, a bit tedious, but I often quote it for an example of a wilful misunderstanding that gets out of hand. And I don't remember a thing about the Woody Allen play so I can't comment on it, other to say that it was the longest of the three and evidently the least memorable."
4,Turning back the hands of time,"This will remind adults of times when the world wasn't so weird, and when celebration of autumn did not involve elaborate spending schemes. The tiny size will appeal to little readers, too. A lovely gentle rhymed happy read aloud that two's and three's will ask for again and again."
3,One Lois Lenski book I couldn't appreciate,"All of my children and even I myself have been very fond of Lois Lenski books over the years. I was very happy when I saw that many of her books were being reissued. This one however, I had to send back. I liked most of it, but I didn't like the parts about Halloween, since we do not acknowledge Halloween in our house. Otherwise, this was a very cute book. If you also do not participate in Halloween, you will not like this book. You could glue those pages together or rip them out, but then it ruins the flow of the poem about fall. So I just chose to return it."
4,Very good but a little faulty,"Ebert's description of the 1950's Godzilla movie that was recently rereleased is a little faulty. He says everyone calls Raymond Burr's character ""Steve Martin"" (in the edited American version) but actually one person calls him just ""Steve"" at one point."
5,A Life Changing piece for me,"I used this composition as my primary audition piece at conservatories all over these great United States. Only one ( DeVry Technical Institute) realized the unique genius of the composer at that time, and I'm happy to say that their insight paved the way for me teaching music for the next 33 years in our public schools!! This recording brought back all of the potent, deep memories that come to the performer of this magnificent work of art. So glad to finally own a decent recording!!"
3,should be made available in lossless format,"I'm disappointed that this track is only available in MP3 format. This lossy compressed version sounds terrible, with missing high frequencies and distorted bass -- it really spoiled my listening pleasure."
1,Utterly Disappointed,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. Say NO to auto-tuned crap like this. The original was just fine and did not need any kind of re-mastering. This is another case of a decades-old classic totally RUINED. I'm sure if the artist had not died in Mortal Kombat he would be suing someone over this.
2,"Great song, horrible remastering","I went to see a live performance of John Cage's music back when I took a music appreciation course in college. Needless to say, this opus was executed perfectly and sounded fantastic live. Eagerly, I later picked it up on vinyl, which I still own (now very much worn out) today.I saw this track listed on amazon and had to download it, for nostalgic purposes. Much to my chagrin, I found this digital download to have a certain harsh, ""tinny-ness"" to it. I suspect a real amateurish sound engineer digitally remastered this from the analog tapes. Hell, about a decade ago I was in a John Cage cover band, and eventhe demo we recorded of this song sounds better!I'm looking forward to the release of a better remastering at the hands of a more reputable label, like Rhino. Only they could do it justice."
2,misleading,"I purchased the 5"" lifting block thinking they were sold as the picture shown, with the blocks and U-bolts and nuts. I was only sent the blocks. The wording in the ad is for 5"" blocks, but is shown with U-botls and nuts as a complete package. Very misleading!j.singer"
4,Funny,This tape has the first two episodes of the series although dubbed versions often cause small variations this still retain much for a simple story. It has many similarities to Sailor Moon in the sense that it starts off like a comedy but given a little patience and a wonderful story will follow that has some drama and intrigue. This tape will introduce six of the main characters in the story of Tenchi Muyo. However this tape will not give you the overlayed plot of the first series just introduce characters. There is comedy but again dramatic flair will add to it in time. Everything builds right?
2,doesn't fit my base,"Like other purchasers, the bowl didn't fit my base. Took all my might and both hands, and even with lubricant, I couldn't do it. I am ordering the older model (amber) bowl from Cuisinart and hoping for better results."
4,Tennis Book,Fairly accurate chronicle of Frank Parker. Lots of personal information that most people would not know about him. I happen to be his nephew so I have a pretty good reference point.
4,romeo and juliet,"romeo and juliet is about a family that hated each other by last names.but a daughter of the family fell in love with a Montague because of his kindness towards her. the book is sad in mind , body and soul to understan how to love a person"
1,Don't buy this book to learn how to keep Anemones,"While this book provides good reference material for identifying anemone fish & sea anemones it provides *no* useful material about how to keep clownfish or anemones alive and healthy in a reef tank.If your looking for a ref. book for identification of the creatures this book is fine. I was looking for a good reference on how to keep anemones, and this book was of no help whatever in that regard."
2,"NOT AS GOOD AS SEASON ONE, BUT STILL EXCELLENT","Season one was outstanding-fast moving, interesting scripts, plenty of goons and racing cars. After watching no 2 some more, I've changed my mind. This updated review gets four stars. My order for season 3 has just been made. I liked to add that if they put Rockford on the air next to the gore ridden kiddie arcade stuff on the tube nowadays, THE OLD RERUNS WOULD WIN!!!(Note to review checker: make my review 4 stars.)"
4,"Great Product, Slow Shipping.","I shopped around for a pack for quite a while that was both light, could be contained and had a decent hydration pack. This pack has all I need and more, both plenty of cargo room, but does not need to flop around when empty. It fits well and has amazing straps. It's got three outer pockets that serve well when you need something small, like a little cash or sunglasses but don't want to dig.The price was great too!The only problem was the shipping. Instead of shipping early or in the middle of its shipping period it shipped on what was probably the last possible day. This is not a problem, but be aware when working with this company (bike somewhere) that if your item needs to arrive in a timely manner, order two weeks early!"
1,There is a reason they are co [inexpensive]!!,"These machines are a piece of JUNK! I have two both barely three months old. One prints 10 pages and stops. The only way to get it to print again is to uninstall and reinstall.The second machine just up and shorted out for no reason.Paper jams, poor printing......the list goes on.I replaced them with a new LExmark and they refused now to even give you USB, Serial or power cords.GIVE LEXMARK A PASS!!!"
1,This printer is basically junk,"I'm currently shopping for a replacement my Z35 printer. It is junk. The first one fed paper in crooked every time, so I exchanged and the second one does the very same thing. Now it says it is out of paper when it isn't. The print quality is mediocre at best, the color reproduction isn't very accurate (using Pantone color references) and the toner is fairly expensive. Recently I have had two genuine Lexmark printer cartridges fail (very poor print quality). I won't buy annother Lexmark product, you shouldn't either."
2,Nothing Great,"I thought this would be wonderful for my miniature dachshund....but he paid no attention to it as a puppy. Now all he wants to do is tear it apart and hump it, that is embarrassing so I took it away lol."
3,good for new pup,Overall the snuggle pup is well made.. the 'heart' batteries didn't last very long and aren't cheap to replace. The heat packs dont' last too long either and are hard to find.. But overall my baby lab loves to sleep with it. I really wanted the black lab pup but had to go for the mutt..
1,"""In Stock""--not!","I ordered this item more than a month ago and have heard from Amazon, but not the vendor, that the item is temporarily unavailable. Fine, but all this time the page says ""In Stock.""If it's not in stock, be honest and admit it.(The form required me to rate the item, but since I haven't received it yet, please ignore the rating.)"
1,Photo/Description Contradiction,"Like Mr. Brophy (other reviewer), I noted the photo and description for this item do not match. If you type in ""Lisle 57900 Serpentine Belt Tool"" in the Amazon search bar, you will get this item and another one sold by Pro Tool Shed. The photo for the Pro Tool Shed item is the correct one-though the price is about $6 higher. I called Amazon customer service to inform them and hopefully get the discrepancy corrected. I am a Prime customer, so the lower price and shipping are what I'm after...I crossed my fingers and ordered it here-hopefully I'll end with the right item."
5,First time,Enjoy my CD getting here fast and quality is great. Will use this shipper when I need to order music because of quality.
4,The Mediator books continue......,"The second book in Meg Cabot's rock-hard series, The Mediator.In this book, Suze is finally fitting in: she's made several new friends, she had gone to a party hosted by the most popular girl in school, plus a cute guy called Tad seems interested in her for a change. other than her amazingly annoying stepbrothers, life in Carmel, California, is going great.That is, until the ghost came.Suze is awakened in the middle of the night by the ghost of a woman, pleading with her to tell ""Red"" that he didn't kill her. With help, Suze assumes that ""Red"" is Red Beaumont, a prominent businessman.Who also happens to be Tad's father. Naturally, Suze is distressed to find that her boyfriend's dad is a murderer....or a vampire! Even more disturbing, Suze finds that Mr. Beaumont is linked with the several disappearances of land owners......... this is a must read, it is practically a work of genius!!!!!!!!!"
3,Predictable But Still Funny and Interesting,"Compared to the first book, Suze is actually pitted against a human. It tends to stray from the whole ghost, mediator plot and delves into a bit of mystery and crime story. There are nice moments but this book doesn't live up to the previous. Nothing pivotal happens and it seems like a kinda side story. One that doesn't fit in with the series. However, if you ignore that, you get to learn a bit more about her new family and it is still as funny as the first book.The basic idea of the story is that a woman ghost asks (or rather weeps) for Suze's help. Suze tracks down the person to contact but ends up going into a deeper mystery of murder. Unfortunately, the prime suspect is the father of Tad, the only boy since moving here that has asked her out."
5,Composite Deck Spacing,"I purchased five of these spacers to install composite decking which has to maintain proper spacing along the sides and at both ends. The spacers worked perfectly and, when placed along the length and at both ends, allowed accurate attachment of the deck material. I used the 3/16 side for the length and the 1/8 side for the end joints. This tool is a must have for installation of composite materials."
3,Big but useful!,"This is a very sturdy device, but is more useful if it is left in place because of the weight and awkwardness of carrying it. It does what is is made to do. The buyer will need to purchase the device that one needs to insert the pages or this device is useless."
1,Not entertaining,"I buy books to be entertained. This book has a light, fluffy plot and predictable characters that could be entertaining, but it mixes in some gruesome violence that makes the overall experience sickening rather than entertaining."
1,BAD CD - chapters mislabeled & out of order,"Sound quality was great and the effects kept it interesting. Unfortunately, the computer files were mislabeled so when I put this on my ipod the chapters were rearranged. When I was listening, the chapters were presented out of order. It didn't seem to matter.This was required reading for me so I don't care about the content. Although, the storyline about the narrator's personal life was too much added drama and negativity."
3,Could have been a 5 page article,"The main point of the book has some good lessons mostly revolving around process effeciency. However, the lessons could be written down in detail in a 5 page article.Instead, he has to include a whole fictional story around these lessons. While he may have good business ideas, M. Goldratt is not a good fictional author. You have to painstakingly get through pages and pages regarding the main characters love life failures in order to get to the meat of the book."
5,Great framework for improving anything,"Though geared to an industrial environment, this book teaches how to think when in need to improve processes. Makes great introductory reading for business process management professionals."
5,Outstanding read,Great book! I couldn't put it down. Very interesting how the author used a novel to present a breakthrough business theory.
4,"Dated, but still useful","Despite the turgid prose and the 80's stereotypes, this book is still a great introduction to the theory of constraints. While some have criticized this book based on the writing style, they are missing the point. This is a basic text on TOC, disguised as a novel. No one will EVER mistake this one for literature."
5,You Don't Have to be an Engineer,"In this book, Goldratt clearly explains the Theory of Constraints in exciting, novel form. The story uses real life examples to explain technical concepts like demand elasticity, independent statistical events, and production bottlenecks. Not only can the reader grasp these without having to learn math, but the book is actually fun to read. From playing hooky at work to eat pizza and drink beer, to coming home drunk with a coworker, to his wife leaving the main character, the book is thoroughly engrossing. I purchased the Kindle version for ease of access, and find myself whipping out my phone whenever I have downtime. Highly recommended."
5,lasts forever,"I bought one of these sets 15 years ago in stainless. It has moved to every truck I have owned since then. The nut that came with the set I bought back then was not stainless, but the rest of the pices were. I ended up replacing the nut after about 7 years with a stainless one I special ordered from fastenal. Other than that this has held up great. Would buy again."
5,Gotta Love Him,"My introduction to Richard Russo came through the film version of Nobody's Fool. Enchanted as I was with the film, the book absolutely enveloped me. While I could never shake Paul Newman as the protagonist, Sully, the rest of the cast of characters- and these are characters as only Russo can build them- defy depiction. Nobody's Fool is alive with so many vivid personalites, the reader feels as if he has always lived in small town, terminally dull Bath, NY.Sully says the witty things we mortals think of only after it's too late to say them. He drinks too much, cares too much and does all the things in excess we are all cautioned not to do. Gotta love him."
3,Magnetic face board,"I remembered these as a kid. Gave one to my Grandson for Christmas. The magnet is SO small, it hardly even picks up the metal filings. Not as fun as I remembered...Hard for a 5 year old to maneuver."
1,not the right one,"I have Nissan Xterra SE v6, the site said it fit for my X, but when it came, only for L4, not V6, had to return it."
4,great,I just bought this and it brought back so many memories. Can't wait to read to my son at Christmas!
5,One of the finest compilations,"This two cd album contains 34 songs which are a mixture of studio and live songs.This compilation features songs from his 1964-1990""s period which was his finest.This two cd compilation is great and is highly recommended."
1,"Very stale, can't give them away","I took a chance on these, aware that a lot of food sellers on Amazon sell very stale product, and I lost my wager. These rice cakes were extremely stale. I bit into one and instantly regretted my decision. I had to go to a local store to buy some new ones the next day, as these were not appetizing. I have been trying to give them away to roommates and friends, but none of them want them! I guess I'll try to donate them to a food bank or else just throw them away."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this DVD after reading other reviews and it seemed like a good choice for a beginning belly dancer however I wasn't very happy with the DVD plan. There was no warm up at all before the dance workout starts. It just launches straight into a move and even though there's arrows to help guide you but it would've been better if there was some build up to the dance moves.
3,Magnetic Farm - great item,"The item was received in good shape, NEW. Item was purchased for our Speech/Language Pathologist for one of our elementary schools. Speech/Language Pathologist would have preferred the felt type but it's a great product for the price and does the job. Thank you"
2,Disapointed,"I did get a good deal on this product, but onfortunately it was cheaper looking then I was interested in. It is very plastic looking, and the color is more of a brown/green. The bucket is rather small inside, so the chance of butts getting all over and making cleanup messy is good. Not the product I would purchase again in the future."
1,An expensive toy.,"This turntable is garbage. Mine broke after just a few months. It looks and feels very cheap, and the sound it produces is not very impressive.I was under the impression that spending 300+ dollars on a turntable would be a great investment, but this thing just sucks."
3,Works Ok Though Not Thrilling,"The Denon works well for an automatic turntable. The internal phono preamp means it can be connected to any available line input on a receiver. The preamp can be switched off if your receiver has a Phono input.I upgraded the phono cartridge to a Shure M97XE and did not bother to even listen to the Denon factory installed cartridge. A small needle nose pliers (not supplied) and lots of patience is a must.The user manual is well written and comprehensive. BUT do not plug the turntable in until all the adjustments have been made. (I had to learn the hard way.)I didn't expect audiophile sound here. Listening to Pop or Classical at medium-low volume is satisfactory. But there is no isolation from external sounds or vibrations. If you like Rock or music of any genre played loud, feedback can set in and sound terrible not to mention the possibility of damaging your speakers or amp."
4,"Good sound, but add some extras","My first test was on the Shure ""Audio Obstacle Course"" test record, the supplied cartridge did not do well. I added a Shure M97XE Cartridge and the improvement was dramatic, lower record noise and much better tracking at 2 grams. The isolation is fair, not nearly as good as my 42 year old AR turntable, but adequate as long as you keep the turntable away from the speakers. Look for some London Phase 4 stereo records on ebay and you will wonder why CDs ever replaced the LP."
4,40 years old but still a fun read,"This novel was written with a ""juvenile"" audience in mind but I (as a 30-year-old) still found it enjoyable, even though I enjoy sophisticated fiction. The story is one of a family that emigrates from California to Ganymede, one of Jupiter's moons, as one of the early waves of settlers there. This is hardly the most sophisticated story out there, and there are occasional dated references (in at least two stories, including this, Heinlein figured slide rules would still be in use!) but Heinlein made at least one interesting prediction - that Jupiter had narrow rings (this was not known until the 1980s). An enjoyable read for sci-fi fans."
3,Gift for grandkids,Brings back childhood fun memories. Gift for grandkids for stockings. Hope they enjoy it as much as we did as kids.
1,Disappointing,"I Like most of JAK's books, but I was very disappointed in this one. I found the male-female medieval stereotypes annoying, and the fantasy plot and characters not good enough to counteract it. Usually one can count on JAK for some witty quips in even the more banal of her books, and this one didn't even have this. This is an older novel apparently, and it shows. My advice is to re-read one of the Arcane series instead - you will be much happier."
2,Neither a good fantasy novel nor a good romance Novel,"Normally I like books from Jayne Ann Krentz, but I was very dissapointed with this one, it's neither a good fantasy book, nor a good romance novel. If you buy a book from JAK, you expect a contemporary romance novel, this one is set in a fantasy world and I was not very comfortable with it."
1,LL COOL J,LADIES LOVE COOL JAMES BUT HE'S STILL JEALOUS THAT A LADY LOVES TUPAC.LL COOL J IT'S TIME TO RETIRE.
3,BOGUS ALBUM !,FOR ONE LL COOL J ISN'T THE G.O.A.T.HE'S A GOOD RAPPER AND ALL BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO CONSIDER HIM A GREAT.DON'T BUY IT.
2,Phenomemon? It ain't!,"This C.D ain't all that! The best song is definetly Candy feat Ralph Tresvant. I can't stop playing it. Phenomenon is allright as well. The song which LL Cool J does with Keith Sweat is not fantastic which is a pity cos i really do like Keith Sweat's music! Track no 10 is pretty dry and sounds real bad at the beggining, but you need to listen to the entire song before you know whether you like it ir don't! Quite frankly i'm dissapointed with you Mr 'LL Cool J'. I am one of the biggest R n' B fans on this planet as i like everything from Nas to Shola Ama.This C.D will only appeal to people who only like Rap, if you don't, your money ain't worth throwing in the bin! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! Buy Destiny's Child's- The writings on the wall. It rocks!"
1,Dangerous product,"I have had this bed rail for about a month now, my son is able to kick it away from the bed during the night. He has fallen out of bed twice, getting caught in the rail that is supposed to protect him. This morning he fell off the bed, fell inbetween the bed and the rail, hit the trash can with the side of his face cutting his lip and tongue! I am calling the manufacturer immediately, dangerous product!"
5,The best bed rail ever!,"It does take a little work to figure out, but once it is installed, it works like no other bed rail I've owned. My in-laws were the first to buy it for my daughter whenever she spends the night at her house. I've purchased 2 others to use at our place."
1,0 for 2 - 2 bedrails broke during first use,"In the past week, we purchased two Safety 1st bedrails and both broke... in the exact same location... the FIRST time we tried to lower the bedrail. The part that broke was the factory-assembled plastic rail ""arm"". Upon our first attempt to lower the bedrail, the arm piece above the ""elbow"" pulled out from the elbow joint and could not be reinserted. In addition to this product defect, we also found the raising/lowering mechanism to be overly complicated and cumbersome to maneuver."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased 2 of these for my toddler son transitioning into a big bed. The box states for mattresses 2-10 inches thick. If your mattress is thicker than 4 inches, don't buy this!!!!! I tried calling the company, who was not much help. Don't bother with this junk!"
2,Can't use on Crib or Toddler bed.,"I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that ""converts"" into a toddler bed. Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib. There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed. Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space. After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again. It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed. My question is ""WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!"""
3,Not what I expected,"I read the reviews and thought I was buying the best bedrail for our needs. I was wrong and disappointed. I wanted a bedrail that I could have down during the day and then easily put up once our child is in bed. This is not a good bedrail if you plan to use it like we wanted to. The bedrail is good and I haven't had any locking problems like those mentioned in some of the reviews, it is just too difficult to lock when a child is sleeping. We decided to try keeping it in the up position and locked all the time so we don't have to mess with it when she is sleeping. Our child is a light sleeper, and I know the noise and difficulty that this thing takes to put up would wake her. Not exactly what I was expecting. I ended up returning it for the 3 sided bedrail. We love it and I think my daughter feels more secure with the rail on all sides. (She loved her crib)."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Bill Engvall is one of the funniest stand-up comedians out there today; his ""Dorkfish"" CD is my favorite standup comedy CD ever. However, for some reason his jokes here are lame, predictable and old. His main focus here seems to be on private parts of the human body and farts. He overenunciates and uses the modern time too much. There are also too many jokes about his daughter on here; they are just not funny. ""First we bodysurfed... in Texas, we call that drowning. So we drowned for a little while."" That is a stupid joke. Although it is true that the word ""awesome"" is overused his son saying ""my compliments to the chef"" after farting at his mother isn't awesome, it's just stupid. No question about it; pass up this CD and buy Ron White's ""Drunk in Public"" CD. It is one of the funniest CDs in the world."
5,He Just Gets More Hilarious!,"Man, Bill Engvall's CDs get better all the time. His material is great."
4,Early days justice in Texas,The book was a very interesting read and gave much insight into how justice was in the early days of Texas.
1,dumb,this posters looks so dumb. they should of gotten a different picture of a bong and the pun at the end with the word higher is not creative at all. this is an over all fail.
5,An exceptional book,"This is an extraordinary little book, filled with pearls of wisdom about the Catholic faith, and about faith in general. One reading is not sufficient; it must be read and reread in order to fully savor what Talbot is attempting to get across about Christian beliefs. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to life their faith more deeply.."
4,Careful use,"The tool is as to be expected from Klein: perfect for daily use. However, the walls of the shaft (in particular, where the head meets it) are VERY thin, so you can not use this to ""pry"" or adjust a bolt or running thread AT ALL. i broke the head off of one immediately doing so. i replaced it, and now knowing this, have had no issues with this tool."
4,Buy It!,"If you are a Hank fan, you will love this movie. It depicts the most important events in his life up until after the fall off Ajax Mountain. I love Hank, and I love this movie. I would love to see a Part 2, because so much has happened with Hank since the movie was made. It does however, leave out some important events in his life during that time-but how can you sum up his life in just 2 hours?"
2,Thomas stinks....movie does no justice!,"As a country music lover and one who loves to read and watch biographies of country stars I find this movie way off! (And this comes from a frantic fan club member Hank Jr. fan) Maybe I feel this way because I read the autobiography prior to seeing the movie. The book is way better. Take my advice and read it!! In the movie, Richard Thomas (remember JohnBoy Walton) plays Hank. Good actor....but Hank Jr. he is not. Too.....weenie! The story deletes a marrage, never mentions his son, and understates the fall off Ajax Mountain. Hanks story is to mass for a two hour movie. I'd like to see a re-make to his story. There were good points: Clu Galagher as JR Smith was great."
2,Somethings are difficult to teach via a book,"I was very disappointed with this book. It has good safety information at the beginning and the end. It suggests standard activities to get comfortable with being in the water. The illustrations are good. It includes a glossary, index, and suggestions for further reading. However, several of the stroke instructions are either poorly worded or incomplete. More care with the text would have make this an excellent book, but the flaws counteract its other good qualities. Too bad."
3,triple star,Vol 1 by Jay is pretty good but i like some of his other cd's better like blueprint but i think it would be three star because of well i like the other cd's better but i like some of his songs on vol 1.
2,Worst of the Jay-Z albums,"This is the only Jay-Z album that I don't like. Jigga sounded like he was riding on the Puffy sound too much. And it's obvious with the ones that Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy producers produced for this album. They sound like rejects from Puffy's own No Way Out album. The one that he did with Babyface is not that good. The album's songs don't fit with Jay-Z's rap style one bit and the album sounds so very uneven. The '98 album he did after this one was really his best to me. This second album is really his worst, full of lame songs!"
1,"after a classic debut, s. ""sell-out"" carter drops garbage","wow this was bad...the lack of real lyricism in most tracks makes this another garbage album, and the beats arent good either. if you enjoy bad rap such as ja rule, you may like this. if you know who kool g rap is, you will hate this along with real hip-hop fans..."
3,best jay z cd,"Jay-Z has gotten worse and worse with time. The second cd was bad and the third was absolutely horiphic. However in his first effort he displayed a little bit of talent and creativity. While about half of the songs didn't so that he put in any effort in to them at all there were a few that were thoughtful (unlike any song he has put out in the past two or three years). This cd isn't what i would call real hip hop but its ok for mainstream. The best songs on the album are ""you must love me"", ""sunshine"", ""city is mine"", and ""where i'm from"". If you like Jay-z you will like this album, however if you are atrue hip hop fan albums i reccomend are ""Blackstar"", ""Like Water for Chocolate"" by common, roots you know the deal"
4,not as bad as people have been saying it was,"After the death of King Of New York superstar Biggie Smalls aka The Notorious B.I.G, questions were circling about who was going to take his spot. Many suspected Jay-Z to fill in that position, unfortunetly this album didn't convinence many listers. Personally that album wasn't that bad, although more commercialised than this pervious LP ""Reasonable Doubt"". The album has a few gems that it could done without, like ""I Know What Girls Like"" and ""Sunshine"", but with cuts like City Is Mine, Friend Or Foe '98 and Streets Is Watching along with many more, you can't go wrong with this one"
5,WOW,"This record was great, I was turned on to her by a friend of who saw her play in New York, and wow. Great Jazz, great vocals! I think the name Machan will be in lights very soon."
4,Good for a series,It was a cool show. Good follow up to the movies. The guy that played Blade was cool. Had a good group of peole in the cast. Good action and story. Only drawback it did not finish. It was cancelled. So the ending isa cliffhanger. Should have made a tv movie to finish it.
5,Blade Short Lived in a excellent series!!,Blade was short lived and i have learned that it was to expensive to continue the series. they could of giving blade a better ending then they did. That was rude to end blade the way that they did. Never start anything that you can't finish. This is a adult series not for children to watch. Five stars from me!!! Blade fan all the way!! THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER FANTASTIC BUY ON AMAZON.COM!!! THIS IS FOR ANY BLADE FAN!!! I PAID 5.48 CAN'T BEAT THAT ANYWHERE TRY TOO!!!!
1,Major problems,This product is of very \poor quality. It broke after the 2nd time I used it. They do not guarantee their products and they certainly will not exchange it either. Extremely bad merchant. Extremely bad customer service. Extremely bad and over priced cheap junk.
2,Just a little away from being awful.,"The only redeeming factors of this film were the lead, Brian White, the female lead (aka bad girl) and antagonist. Those 3 actors save a pretty weak story and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. As a writer looking into exploring a gigolo story line, I'm happy to see this film step into every cliche you'd expect plot wise. Screen writers need to watch bad films to see the pitfalls they must avoid in their own work, and this movie is a great example of that."
2,you should skip this one,"This movie is the worst of the Trois series, believe me. The acting was second rate at best, the plot was weak and the main woman in the story pictured in the background on the box cover was cute but not all that appealing to me.I've seen all of the Trois movies and each one up to the second one got better, but this one was a major bomb. The story revolves around an up and coming rap artist who turns to becomming a male escort in order to pay off his debts. He meets a woman who gets him established in the business, she runs his affairs, cares for him and becomes quite attached to him. Soon, he learns that paying off his debts are the least of his problems. He falls in love with one of his clients and things begin to fall apart from there. The scenes had no spark to them and the actresses seemed to be trying too hard to be something that should come almost naturally."
3,Quite a surprise!,"Just watched this and was impressed by the great twists, good acting, and incredible directing. Honestly, I think I rated it lower because I did not expect such a good film based on the poorer ones that preceeded it, but it was good. The director's creative filming and the main female whose character's name was khairia (sp?) were both memorable. Now this is a step in the right direction!"
2,A let down,"When I think of novelizations of movies and TV shows, I usually am excited because you get to know what the character was thinking and you get little scenes that never made it on screen.This book provided almost none of that. It felt like I was reading a plot synopsis of the first season.I do love Ballyk, and I rather do like the first season so even a meh retelling of it in book form is worth at least 2 stars.This is definitely more of a check out of the library book then a buy book."
3,"Good Material, Bargain Basement Quality","The liner notes are virtually nonexistent and the mastering is certainly nothing to crow about, but this CD was worth the price I paid ($12.99 at the local music store). You get two albums for the price of one; Locked In being an uneven but worthwhile effort and New England, the crown jewel in ""Boneland"". Wishbone Ash was generally weak with their vocal presentations, but man oh man, their guitar work was inspired by the Gods. So yeah, go ahead and grab this CD if you can't otherwise get a copy of New England, imo the best Wishbone Ash ever put forth."
1,Atlas of the United States,This product was not the issue date that I ordered over the internet. I do not like to order one thing and receive another. I feel like I was tricked!
5,Fantastic,"/I think the first reviewer said most of what can be said about this fantastic book.I purchased it for reference for something I may have forgotten or technology that did not exist when I was going to the University.Such clarity of a technical subject is very rare. If you don't understand an active circuit, this book is the place to go.I wish this book had existed when I was going to school.\"
3,"Easy to use and understand, but needs to cover newer drugs.",This book is very easy to use and is written in language that is easy to understand. I was disappointed that James Rybacki did not cover some of the newer drugs that are out and which have been used for several years. Many of these newer medications are being used more than some of the older medications which he did include in the book. I think that it needs further updating every year.
5,Important addition to the home library,"Have recommended this to friends as a ""must have"" since the information contained is important to read prior to taking any prescription medication. This is as complete and thorough a guide as you'll find other than using the much more cumbersome and scientific/technical PDR. This is the fourth update I've purchased, during the past ten years, and know you will find it as much of a necessary reference as I have."
5,"Fit great, works great!","No complaints here. Replaced factory pump on 1999 Cobra that went out after 13 years. Hope this one lasts just as long! Comes with seal and replacement clips for EVAP lines if you need them. Packaging was a little scary as the pump assembly was basically just sitting inside the large box, but it seemed to be unharmed."
5,Brilliant,"Sugar and Lyman bring mycology to us in a terrific, practical manner that helped me learn this better than anybody could have possibly explained it to me. The illistrations are gruesome, however they are fascinating and this book is really great."
2,inaccurate definitions,"I disliked this dictionary because of the incorrect definitions to the words republic, democracy and democrat; just to name a few."
3,it stinks at first,read all of the reviews. it does stink at first run one or two tanks befor u use it in a tent or ground blind its not powerfull but it does take the edge of the cold off...
4,oooo that smell!,"burn a half tank of propane outside before using. it smells during the first use, after that it works great for a 1 or 2 person tent anything larger would require a larger unit."
2,Coleman SportCat Perfec Temp Catalytic Heather with Insta Start,this is a nice little heater but doesnt really project to much heat. We use it in a canopy tent for tailgating and without sides you have to have your hands over the top of it it warm them up. Hand warmers seem to work better than this one for what we wanted it for.
1,I believe this heater could have killed me.,"I used the Coleman Catalytic heater (1,500 btu version) over the weekend, as did a friend of mine. We camp in the front end of a gooseneck horse trailer; we each had our own trailers. These heaters were new out of the box. Did not heat the small space at all(only 30 degrees outside), ditto on everyone else's comment about the smell. Then in the morning the inside of our trailers (ceiling and walls) were COVERED with BLACK SOOT; as were our faces and everything we coughed up for the next 8 hrs. The space was ventilated!!It was very scary to think about what we had inhaled all night long.The next comment will be directly to Mr. Coleman. If it was just my heater that did this, I would assume it was faulty. However, my friend had exactly the same experience with it. I would not recommend this product!!"
4,Lots of features for the price,You can't beat all of the features this receiver offers for the price. The only draw back is the amp. The amp is not very powerful. I had an older Pioneer 500w that had lots more juice.
5,A Pirate of Exquisite Mind,"This ebook was a fun and interesting read!!! I enjoyed the descriptions of events, the characterization of the pirate - Dampier - just enough to know him a little yet those details left unstated that maintained the ""air"" of mystery about the man. To think that a pirate could be a dedicated naturalist above all else and be recognized for his work and writings by the Royal Academy of Science is astounding."
3,Capleton I Testament,Well I'll point out something on a different note. If your looking to pick up a dancehall album for the first time. Then put this one down and get his first album. It was more geared for yo hip hop kids looking to expand past the Bob Marley Legend album. This album is deeper in message. Plus the 1st album can help build your Lil' Jon Collection up some.
5,It's not Rhino's fault...,"I love this boxed set, but my main mission here is to fill some of you in. Yes, the collection would be better with Joni Mitchell, but if you bothered to read the liner notes, you'd know that SHE is the one who said she would never allow any of her work to be on any collection of strictly women musicians."
4,Nothing to hold key in - don't super glue too far in!,Nothing to hold key in - don't super glue too far in! Otherwise this c key cover is awesome!Nothing to hold key in - don't super glue too far in! Otherwise this c key cover is awesome!
1,"I give this one star under protest, it doesn't deserve any.","I reordered it and got the wrong thing both times. The box says it's for a LG C1400, the replacement box says the same thing. It's not for a LG L1400. It doesn't fit. They should stop selling it here."
5,Cosmic Command -- modern mysticism,"A little deflated at the one-sentence entries, at first. However, surprisingly enough, reading had an uplifting, pleasant effect. Not reading the book for few days at a time and common anxiety/depression states returned. Note:The titles of Vernon Howards books are a kind of marketing/advertising tool, it seems. If the titles were strictly descriptive, the would cause one to yawn, such as, 'Mystic Truisms,' vs. 'Cosmic Command.' Although not popular thinking, Vernon's Books are not 'flaky' or nonsensical. They do, in fact, cut through a lot of the insanity and foolishness of conventional thinking."
3,Didn't fit my Kirby.. but I forced it too,"It claims to fit my vacuum model yet the cardboard doesn't come close to fitting. I cut the cardboard a bit and taped it on so it's functional but I'm wasn't happy it claimed to be compatible. Another case of ""you get what you pay for"" so for the price, it's worth a little inconvenience in my opinion."
5,Take the journey!,"This author lets you ride shotgun on her journey from childhood to womanhood. I felt ""let into"" her life -- the good, the bad and the in between. I really liked and respected that.I found reading ""And How My Spirit Soars"" refreshing and inspiring like a very honest conversation--sometimes painful, sometimes funny--conversation with a very good friend.I highly recommend!"
2,Doesn't work for me,"I really tried to like this book, but I just couldn't. There were too many occasions where the author asked me to suspend my disbelief so that the plot could continue. How do the same people end up always finding each other? The relationship between the main characters made me very uncomfortable, and I am not a complete prude. The way love in most forms was presented in this novel was completely disheartening, and as a mother, the way that children were portrayed in this work was difficult to stomach. I understand that the idea here is that we are all destroying our world, and given the chance to do it all again we most likely would make the same stupid mistakes, but there were very few characters to like or admire in this book. I really didn't care if they made the same mistakes we make every day...frankly I was hoping to see the last of all of them very soon."
1,Cursory info at best,"I am a Nurse Practitioner seeking a one-stop, all-inclusive cardiology resource. This is not it. In fact, there is more indepth info in the cardiology sections of my Internal Medicine books. Harrison's, especially, but also Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment from the same publisher offer more substance. My apologies to the editor and contributors, I am sure you are fine cardiology professionals, but the book doesn't quite cut it."
2,Incomplete,"No mention of ME (CFS) a very common and extremely disabling disease incorporating cardiomyopathy. Running treadmill tests on ME patients is very detrimental to them as post exertional malaise is a hallmark of the disease. Cardiologist should be aware of the exercise contraindication.Also ME patients have reduced ejection, low blood volume, orthostatic intolerance, and increased cardiac disease mortality. When ME patients die of heart disease, it is, on average, at an age 25 years younger than that of the whole population of people who die of heart disease."
4,Awsome,"My dwarf hamster really enjoys this wheel and so do I. The wheel was loud but I simply put a magic rub earser under the flat surface of the wheel which cut down on the noise by a lot.Whats even better is that my hamster seems to only poop in the wheel, when she runs all the poop collects in the tray which makes for an easy clean up.It doesn't take up any space in the cage which keeps the cage roomy.Over all I'm extremly satisfied with this product, if you need a wheel by this one."
3,Fair value,The camera looks and feels cheap. But for less than 100 bucks you may not get anything better than this.
1,A waste of hard earned dollars,"This is my second Fuji Digital Camera. The first one failed with a ""ZOOM ERROR"" after only a few months of average use. The camera was useless. I returned it to the place of purchase, and of course the model is no longer in production. After an argument with the store manager, they allowed me to trade up to the newer model, charging only the difference.Well After about a year of average use, I got the exact same ""ZOOM ERROR"" message on the newer model. I do not want to pay $250 every two years for a camera, so this will be my last FUJI purchase. When I spend money, I expect reliability, and FUJI misses the mark!"
2,Disappointed,"I am a little disappointed in the product. Having owned another Fuji digital (which I loved!)and going by the customer reviews I thought this would be a good little camera. Picture quality is excellent, but it is really poor on getting candid shots. The shutter activates so slowly that you don't get the picture that you thought you snapped. Good for outdoor scenery and stills. Not so good for photographing the grandkids!"
4,Good but not as great as his other work ...,"I enjoy Gerry Spence and love his attitude and dedication to the common man. I loved How to Argue and Win Everytime and this began as better than that. But by midway through I felt my expectations were violated as this was billed as not just a courtroom book, which is interesting, but a practical application book. While much of what he says certainly has application anywhere my personal disappointment was in the heavy trial legal application through 75% of the book. If I was a lawyer this would be a superb book - just not exactly what I thought but he has lots to teach us."
5,MS. CHAPMAN - AS ALWAYS - IS SIMPLY UNBELIEVABLE!,Another long eternity between CDs from an outstanding and heartfelt artist - but well worth the wait. Every song is outstanding. The songs are sparsely arranged which adds to their poignancy. I liked the length of the CD also - just over 42 minutes. Just long enough for you to really absorb her messages and the etherealness of their delivery. One request Ms. Chapman: Please record more often. Five years is much too long to wait for an artist of your caliber especially with a lot of the trash that's released these days. But I'll be there no matter when your CDs are released.
4,"Masterful ""Stories"" returns to Tracy Chapman's roots","I've been a Tracy Chapman fan since I first heard ""Baby Can I Hold You"" way back in the 1980s. I thought her first album was incredible, but the followups left me a little disappointed. Even though there were very good songs on all the albums, there wasn't much depth or consistency. I got ""Telling Stories"" on Saturday and have been listening to it ever since. Reviews say it is similar to her first cd, ""Tracy Chapman"", but to me it seems more like a synthesis of that album and the style of some of her worthier competitors, like Natalie Merchant. If you like Tracy Chapman, Natalie Merchant, Julia Fordham, or early Everything But The Girl, you should enjoy this cd. One word of caution: the blues grooves that made ""Give Me One Reason"" such a big hit are missing from this album. The album also flows well from start to finish, for an amazing listening experience."
3,A little dull .... but easy listening anyway,"Don't get me wrong, I really like Tracy Chapman - BUT I expected better considering it is 5 years between albums. 'Telling Stories' begins with the title track which has received reasonable airplay in Australia for awhile now. The song eventually grew on me as it is rather catchy, so I went and bought the album. I have listened to the album more than 5 times, and it is rather dull. It is lacking some magic and life, and fails to really deliver. After each track, you wait for the next one to be a little different but they all sound very similar. As mentioned by other readers, the album is very short in that finishes well under 45 minutes. I believe consumers are entitled to a few bonus tracks these days. My favourite tracks include 'The Wedding Song' and 'Unsung Psalm'. The album is probably an ideal purchase if you want background music for a dinner party, but for those who are after some Chapman music - go for the first album."
1,Don't waste your money on Violet!!,"I bought the entire set of incredibles action figures for my four year old son and was very disappointed. The invisible violet arrived broken, and the regular violet broke within days. The joints are not secure and will break easily. ---I would however reccommend the Dash, Syndrome, and Mr. Incredible, we've had them for over a year with no problems. Don't buy this Violet or the Mom."
5,Charming!,"If you are a fan of comics as a story-telling medium, and especially if you are a fan of cute animal characters, do yourself a favor and start here with the adventures of Owly! Two stories are contained within these pages. In the first, Owly meets his friend and companion Wormy! In the second, Owly and Wormy befriend a pair of hummingbirds! Andy Runton has developed a unique storytelling method. These aren't exactly ""picture books"" but they don't contain traditional dialog and lettering either. Most of the communication is through symbols. Very interesting and it works! You can hear the words in your head even though none are really written on the pages!"
4,Cutest series ever.,"Andy Runton, Owly: The Way Home and The Bittersweet Summer (Top Shelf, 2004)The first book in Runton's widely (and justly) praised Owly series, this wonderful little book contains two stories: ""The Way Home,"" in which Owly meets Wormy, who gets lost in a storm and wants Owly to help him find his way home, and ""The Bittersweet Summer,"" where Owly and Wormy become friends with some hummingbirds. Owly is, for the most part, wordless; everything is conveyed with expressions and thought bubbles. It's clever and funny and heartwarming, a definite change of pace from most of the graphic novels that have been appearing for the past few years. Definitely recommended for when you need a pick-me-up. ****"
2,Sloppy research. Do not rely on this book.,"Sloppy research ruins a good topic. The writing style is smooth. I like how the story of Soviet spies is confirmed by the Venona papers.HOWEVER, the research is sloppy. If the publisher had a fact checker, he or she should have been fired.Inexcusable errors. The CPUSA slogan was ""Communism is 20th Century Americanism."" Morgan says ""Communism is Americanism.""It is Moiseye Olgin (variation of Moses), not Misha Olgin (variation of Michael).Harry Gold lived in a house on Kindred Street with his father and brother. He did not live in an apartment.The Federal women's prison at Alderson is in West Virginia, not near Seattle.With mistakes such as these, can anyone trust the details in this book.Shame on the writer and the publisher"
1,mavpcc,"I coach youth track in texas and purchased this starting block for Middle school and high school athletes. It is very narrow and not very sturdy, so it limits the runners ability to really explode from the blocks with any sort of power. I would reccommend spending a little more and get a olympic style block. I purchased another block. This one just sits in the garage."
2,Exremely Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed in the flavor of outrageous orange coffee. If you are looking for a strong orange flavor, this coffee is not for you. I could not taste any orange flavor at all. This includes both the regular and decaf varieties.I usually purchase Seville Orange from other dealers. Seville Orange has a very strong orange scent and flavor. I will buy Seville Orange from now on."
4,An enjoyable Max and Annie book!,"I agree with other reviewers that this is not her best work to date. There are other Death on Demand mysteries out there that are much more enjoyable. However, this is still an enjoyable read.Annie is a typical woman running her own business. She has many problems of her own and many issues she is working out for herself through out this series. Max is a rich man who doesn't need to work, but who loves Annie enough to do what she would like him to do. (To a degree!) While they work out their own lives together, they also happen to solve mysteries.The setting is nice and the characters are fun. The plot is convoluted. I enjoyed this book, but did find it hard to follow everything that was going on at times.Enjoy."
5,A Great Mystery series,Carolyn G. hart is definately one of the best mystery authors out there. Her stories are very captivating and interesting and a fun easy read. If you like a cozy mystery give Hart a try with her Annie Darling mysteries. Annie is a great charcter and she is always surrounded by a cast of crazy characters that make her life more exciting. She is a bookshop owner... so a few murders are obviously constantly popping up on her doorstep.
2,Needs some improvement,"I bought this harness because my dog goes crazy in the car unless she is buckled down and hops from the front seat to the back on the whole ride. I wanted her to be safe on trips and also prevent me from getting distracted. It wouldn't stay secure on my dog due to the front plastic piece which make the hole for the head larger and smaller being too loose and not staying in place. I would recommend that you do not buy this product, it is not safe for your pets, especially if they like to wiggle around."
2,Like the 'safety tether' but not the 'safety harness',"I found the PetBuckle Safety Harness to be heavy and clunky. There is no need for the seatbelt size buckles on it - at least not for my dog, who weighs 30 lbs. After using it a couple of times I realized that I can attach the tether to my dog's regular harness, and then connect it to the car -- achieving the same effect for less money. So my recommendation is to skip the Safety Harness and either use your dog's current harness or buy one. Purchase only the Safety Tether. It's much easier to use and just as effective."
3,pet seatbelt,"I am happy with this item. I do no know if I am doing it wrong, but my 17lb dog is able to move somewhat around the back seat. When I buckle the seat belt can be pulled, so then she is able to move side to side. I have bought several other belts, this is the best one so far."
5,Great Read for Christmas and year round!,"This is such an inspiring novel. It can help you find the good in your inner soul by introducing you to the opportunities each of us has everyday to make a difference. How we react to everyday circumstances is what molds our lives and those around us. If you don't analyze your reading material as deeply, then you will still enjoy this FEEL-GOOD uplifting novel. I definately reccomend it!"
4,Delightfully stupid,"If you like what I call ""stupid humor"", you'll love Brak! If Adult Swim's comedy appeals to you, check this set out."
4,What a gem!,"This collection requires the viewer to have a very special sense of humor: what my co-workers and I call ""the gift"". If you have it, you'll be very amused by these episodes. If not - you'll pretty much think this is the stupidest thing you've ever watched. I fall into ""the gift"" camp, and found this collection great. The more absurd the situation, the better. Consider the following: beeflogs, the movie title ""@ss Disaster IV"", Jerkwater High School, a 2 player video game called ""Head Stomper"", where 1 player's character stomps on the 2nd player's character. If these items sound funny - you'll love this. If not, move along down Highway 40 in your big ol' pickup truck, buddy."
5,large baggage,"this bag is ALOT larger than I expected. The materail seems tough, but thin. Is excellent to fold up when not in use. THis thing is large enough to pack a body in......no kidding. (LOL). VERY NICE"
3,Just okay,"It seems solidly constructed and quite large. The only thing I don't like so much is a lack of stiffness in the bag; on the other hand, I can hang the bag in a locker rather than on."
4,Nice bag!,"Got the bag as a Chrismas present for my brother, it came as advertised. Was a little smaller than I thought, which is why I only gave it 4 stars."
5,Versatile,"We have purchased several of these bags in varying sizes for college-aged kids. Great for that purpose as the bags hold a lot of stuff, and flatten for limited dorm room storage. Makes college move in and move out easier than hauling boxes. They come packed in small bags that are also quite useful for building a small tool kit, medicine supply kit, etc."
4,Okay,"I was use to a little stiffer bag that stay upright when you pack it. This is a duffle bag style. You have to constanly grap it to fill it. That is not a con but just what it is. The bag itself is strong and very big. it does hold a lot of clothing. I do use it every week to transport all my stuff to and from my summer place and home. I was suprise about the size of the bag.If you want a duffle style bag with plenty of volume than this is a good choice for you. My self it is too big and I can not live out of it like I need too. I seem to lose things inside of it and have to take it all out to find things.if you want to transport to and from 2 places and unload all when you get there this is the bag for you,"
5,A+,"doesn't have any of that stupid wirecage stuff that breaks in a month.... it's simple bag for people that will be using it frequently.I've had it for a few months now, and it's held up to plenty of abuse in that timespan."
4,Another swell Grisman-Garcia album,"Another collection of nice, relaxed, acoustic duets, culled from the many hours of informal jam sessions that these two shaggy roots music old-timers held over the years. Jerry croons country oldies like the George Jones classic, ""Take Me"" and Merle Travis's ""Dark As A Dungeon"" and ""Nine Pound Hammer,"" reggae tunes like ""Sitting Here In Limbo"" and several traditional songs, which help anchor the album's old-timey sound. The sedate, laid-back version of Bob Dylan's epic ""Ballad Of Frankie Lee And Judas Priest"" is a highlight, though, honestly, there's no weak link to be heard on this album. These performances are understated and sincere, and though Grisman may have mined his archives several times for similar material, he is certainly not scraping the bottom of the barrel here... Not at all!"
2,Not so much!,"This book just wasn't my cup of tea. I think it was well-enough written and would appeal to many, but it just didn't have enough to hold my attention. I stopped reading about half of the way through. This may just be my own personal quirks and may not relate to how worthy this read is."
3,Caprica season 1.5 DVD,Same problem as with Caprica 1.0 DVD... around three hours into some of the DVDs the audio goes out for a very short time... do not hear two or three words of dialogue... the video is fine during the audio problem. No contact information how to get the few DVDs replaced.
1,rIP oFF,"No way I am going to pay $35 for 10 episodes that are not even blue ray. They screwed us cutting it off the way they did, and did not offer 1.0 in Blu-Ray. the show was just getting really interesting for us hard core BSG fan. Then they cancel, and want us to pay $70 for non HD for the whole season? LMAO. I only paid $60 for the BR seasons of Lost a peice. I loved the series. But uuuuhhhhh....we are not stupid. This is truly trying to milk the fans, and I look down on SyFy and universal. They can become a channel of perpetual Giant Spider movies. I for one am gettig sick of their ability to market shows. StarGate is one of the worst series ever, but they keep that trype going. Its the orginal Star Trek without a spaceship."
3,Coulda - Shoulda - Woulda,"The series appeared to be handled by a wide receiver, on a rainy day, with butter fingers, running in oil.I agree with the SyFy channel analogy of a TV channel bought by rednecks watching WWF wrestling and Hunting Ghosts.Sad but True.Good story, good acting, eventually turning into a TEEN Wolf Episode.This could have been great. Caprica should have been great. Caprica would have been great if there was intent, purpose, and follow thru on the part of the people who made it. This show could have easily lead into the BSG Blood and Chrome series. Hope I'm not looking at 2 good ideas with no follow thru. Or - I could just turn into a redneck and not care - just watch ghost busters lol :)Don't get me wrong - it deserves all 3 stars and it is worth watching - but when the folks who made it don't stand up for it - how can I?"
5,5 star all the way,Factory box and disc. This story of Caprica is fantastic. You do learn so much more about the Cylon's. and understand Battle Star Galactica so much more.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The Avengers in a crossover with one of my favorites, The Squadron Supreme. The crazy megalomaniac Moses Magnum forces both teams, The Avengers and The Squadron Supreme to take part in a bizarre confrontational contest that he has set up.Just because he is mad and all, you know. He forces them to fight and compete with each other to his own ends."
5,So impressed that I had to buy another,"I was so impressed by the 25' ""Big Johnson"" Power Tape that I got yesterday that I had to buy another. WOW! What a good deal.Quality made and engineered wellHolster clip includedRobust"
5,Nice tape despite the stupid name!,"I have been usind this for quite a while and it has been pretty sweet so far. I like the belt clip, and the accuracy provided by the clip. The lock works well. You can extend it pretty far with out it bending. All in all a solid buy."
3,Kind of bulky.,"I'd get another tape (Stanley) instead of this one, unless the price is around $5. It is durable, and the tape itself is good quality. However, the belt clip is bulky, and overall the size of the tape body is bulky. Not really necessary. Get a good Stanley."
1,"Cold Smoking & Salt Curing Meat, Fish & Game",A very disappointing book. The descriptions are to vague and are of little use to anyone other then someone with absolutely no knowledge what so ever of this subject. I got more information surfing the net for 45 minutes then this whole book has cover to cover. What good is a book that feels the need to include a recipe for a ham and cheese sandwich? If you are looking for information on smoking and curing meats I highly suggest you look into one of the other books on this subject. This book is not the money.
1,Not worth the time or money,"I am a food professional and consulting chef with many years experience curing and smoking. I found much of the information to be incorrect and some of it unsafe from a food handling, curing, and smoking perspective. There are much better sources of information available, both in books and on the Internet."
3,Hold Up Wait A Minute....,"As far as the music's concerned, I would rate this cd 5 stars, but my rating reflects some techincal issues I have with the cd and some of the musical content. I wish they would have included the extended versions of Soul 2 Soul's biggest hits ""Back 2 Life"" and ""Keep On Moving"". They edited both songs to 3 minutes each and faded em out early. I was dissapointed, they cut out the best part of Keep On Moving. They also put some jacked up version of my other fave song ""Missing You"" on here. I was so upset. Now I have to order ""volume 2"" to get the original version. The mixes of ""Keep On Moving"" and ""Fairplay"" are pretty cool, so at least u get some unreleased stuff. Overall this is a good cd, but it's not as definitive and complete as I would have liked, but the music's classic."
5,Love These!!!,These pulls are just what I wanted for my kitchen drawers. They are not too big and not too small. They are perfect!!
4,BRILLIANT,"I FINALLY WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND I AM SO HAPPY I DID. IT WAS GENIUS. IF YOU DON'T ENJOY THIS MOVIE, YOUR NOT A TRUE FAN OF SLASHER FILMS.WATCH THIS MOVIE!!"
5,"Really great concept. Very cool movie, entertaining to the max!!!","Hello World,Ya know we see so many movies on the shelves in these ""mega movie"" stores, or even on net rentals for the techno advanced miser. But in essence we read covers and take a chance and if you like all the classics in this genre, well then this is the flick to see. Really ""zupa"" acting with great humor which in my opinion makes the film. Not too much gore mind you but the fact of the, matter is that it takes you on an enlightening journey into a slasher's life. Which in my opinion is something I've never seen before. This might be a canditate for cult status. Rent it...buy it...!Thanks for reading, fje"
2,Great movie! Awful blu-ray!,"This is a great movie. It's a deconstructionist horror film, in which the genre is disassembled and analyzed, then reassembled at small scale at the end. I can't recommend it enough, if you like horror movies at all. It's much smarter than most.The Blu-Ray edition is garbage. Beyond the lousy packaging, it has no extras: no commentary, no deleted scenes, no bonus features of any sort. There isn't even a *menu*. This isn't because there are no extras for the movie. They're all only on the DVD edition. I don't know how this makes any sense, but there it is. Buy the DVD. There is no reason to buy the Blu-Ray."
5,"Great, Fresh Horror Movie","This is a truly delightful film. It starts off with funny, somewhat snarky dialogue. It provides a refreshing take on the horror genre and gives us a behind the scenes (mask) look at what it takes to be a psychotic serial killer. Great film that everyone should own."
3,Better than it's budget deserves,"The hacks at Asylum could learn a thing or two from this movie. I'm not going to over praise it, but credit to the makers for doing a lot with a little. Its tough to know your limits when you have a low budget movie but the makers of this film did a good job. If you've seen all the slashers enough to be able to tell the difference in plots to all the Friday the 13th films than this movie is for you."
5,Totally awesome cd,"I have always been a die hard fan of ABBA and always will be but I have to say , go A*Teens go . I grew with ABBA and now I hope A*Teens continue this sound so my children can grow with them .Mamma Mia blew me away ........... I'm hooked .Totally awesome!"
1,Forget it,"This is one of the most unnecessary records that had been released in the last few years. The voices are almost the samebut the dance beats are just annoying.The only good song is ""Gimme Gimme GImme"".If yxou want to have the A teens buy their other albums. They are really good but please forget this one."
1,Sick and wrong... like listening to Abba karaoke...,"I can't believe we live in a world where these no-talent kids are paid good money and granted celebrity for delivering bland and blasphemous covers of Abba classics. Agnetha and Frida had great voices -- really lovely voices that blended together and were capable of subtle shifts in tone and harmony... These A-teen girls are just belting -- no musicality whatsoever! It's an insult to Abba. I'm sorry, but these mannequins are supposed to be ""reintroducing"" my generation to Abba...?!?! I don't think so. The A-teens don't hold a candle to the original Swedish Fab Four."
2,NOT BAD AT ALL BUT IF YOU LIKE ABBA GET THE ORIGINALS !!!,"I must say that this versions are not bad at all, but at any rate I prefer the originals. Why? Simply, because this gruop can't match the quality of ABBA. You can't compare the great Agnetha and Frida's voices with the two singers here. And remember that when ABBA started their career as a group, every member were well known in Sweden as individual artists, that's to say they were experiencied musicians, and this group doesn't appear to be so. In fact, the interpetations here are all danceable, the recording quality is ok, but the whole thing is not as enjoyable as ABBA was.I will finish this review with a question: can anyone tell me who played the instruments here and what did the two boys here? I'k like to know it since I can't find the credits anywhere on my copy, and the male voices doesn't appear bo be evident on the recording."
5,Outrageously GREAT!,"I just spent 8 weeks in Europe and Danced every night to this fantastic music. To my amazement, they are not popular in the USA! This group of very young people is extremely talented!"
2,"Mamma Mia, Once is Enough.","Abba was a great band, but there is no reason under the sunfor this CD. There is very little variation from this and the original recordings. Although they are talented, this CD lacks any creativity whatsoever. Why would I buy this CD when I can buy an ABBA CD and hear the exact same thing. A Teens is a cheap ripoff copycat band."
1,UNORIGINAL ABBA WANNABES!,"I am a big fan of ABBA and I hoped that this group would at least have some originality. But, after listening to it, I realized that the CD was exactly the same as ABBA's Gold Album (which I own)and I am very disapointed. A teens can't even sing as well as ABBA! ABBA's albums are great, don't settle for anything less than the original and the best. No true ABBA fan would ever own this wannabe album."
5,A Religious Classic?,"It says on the jacket of this book that Black Elk Speaks belongs in the company of 'religious classics'. Maybe so, but even if you regard his visions as indicative of a religious experience, the parts of the book dedicated to the description of these visions make for rather tedious reading. The real meat of the book is his decriptions of the last of the major indian battles at Rosebud, Little Big Horn (Custer's Last Stand), and Wounded Knee. Black Elk and his friends were there, and lived through those harrowing days. A must-read book for anyone who wants to know how it really was."
5,Gulzar's best!,"If you are a Gulzar fan, you have to have this. I have to yet meet a person who hasn't liked Ijaazat! A very well-made movie on the eternal triangle of 2 women, 1 man. But a rare mature story-telling! The music, which is forms a strong backbone of any Gulzar movie is at its very best out here. I'm guessing that the poetic genius & lyrical quality of the cinema will probably be lost in translation...but definitely a must see for any cinema lover."
3,New! New York Mets Instant Pet ID Tag,New! New York Mets Instant Pet ID Tag Quality was good my daughetrs dog seem to lose it too easily
3,A bit too fast...,"I appreciate the crispness of this choir's performance; however, I am disappointed that, in many of the slower pieces, Kodaly's knack for capturing a distinctive warmth is overlooked, because the tempi are much too fast."
5,Provided the design sound-bytes I needed,"Roger C. Parker's One-Minute Designer provided me the practical information I needed to improve my store's business cards, letterhead, ads, brochures and flyers. It helped me identify what my staff and I were doing right and where our efforts could be improved. I especially like the way Roger C. Parker's One-Minute Designer saves time by leading me directly to the needed information. The before and after illustrations make each point perfectly clear."
2,id say the worst out of the three!!,"I just didnt care for this cd at all! I loved the first two , but now im kinda ready for rod to do something else! And i didnt care to much for his choice of other artists on the record! if you really want to hear a great album of remakes check out dolly partons ""Those were the days"" cd, and leave this one alone!"
1,enough already,"Hey Rod the Mod. How bout getting back into rock and roll and quit boring us with this junk. If I want to hear this, I will put on, Bing or Frank or anybody else.So how come BMG didnt copy protect this like they did with Santana? Could it be it's so lame that nobody wanted to make anymore copies after hearing this?"
1,Lightweight covers-Not interpretations,"Rod's rock and roll career proved that he was brilliant at interpreting other people's work. Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Etta James and Tim Hardin provided Rod an opportunity to soulfully perform covers that with Rod's gravelly vocals, were wonderful. His latest money making scheme provides soulless versions of the originals. Let's hope that Rod doesn't change his mind and that this is truly the last of his American Songbook debacle. You're not really too old to rock are you Rod?"
1,???,I recommend gavin Degraw's cd..this album sucks..i just flushed it in my toilet bowl..waste money
4,Should've gotten the smaller one,I guess I was thinking I'd want the space to bring my gear on longer bike rides. However lately I've been just using it for my morning runs. It's a bit bulky to just go jogging with. I should've gotten the smaller model. Oh well...Otherwise it is a great product.
5,Great Day Hike Pack!!!,"For lightweight (<15 lbs) dayhikes this is my favorite pack. It's the right size expanded, but can be cleverly made smaller for when the pack only needs to hold your water, lunch and a jacket. I've carried over 20 lbs all day with this, but the thin shoulder straps don't provide enough padding and you'll definitely feel it (keep weight <15#'s and save your shoulders). The streamline design means there isn't a lot of places to attach things to the outside, but makes it a great fastpack design. I have a red one, and am thinking about getting the black one too (already have toooo many packs but.....)"
3,Good Product,But the onkyo ipod dock was better. I did not want to keep touching my IPOD. The Onkyo dock allows me to play the ipod using the remote.
5,Excellent details,I'm perfectly satisfied with this poster. My husband is into the Tour de France and I'm covering the walls with these posters for his birthday. They are ideal.
4,milwaukee battery,good product but does not last as long as I would like. I use it intermitently and it loses charge when not in use. It is necessary to have at least two to keep one in a ready state.
3,Doesn't fit the Panasonic screwdriver charger,"Even though Panasonic makes the driver that this battery fits for Milwaukee, and the both the Panasonic and Milwaukee drivers and batteries look very similar, this battery won't fit in the Panasonic charger. It will fit in the Panasonic driver, but if you can't charge it, fitting in the driver doesn't matter.I bought this battery because Amazon was out of stock on the Panasonic EY9021B battery for the EY503B driver. So hopefully Amazon will get the Panasonic battery back in stock."
4,Milwaukee 2.4 Battery Review,"I have owned a Milwaukee electric screwdriver for a long time. After about 7 years I had to replace the battery, then I saw the battery available on amazon and replaced it again because the time it would hold a charge was getting really short.Recently I went to use the electric screwdriver and it would not operate. I bought another one and the new battery charged in the old charger and the gun worked fine, so all I really needed was the battery.I agree with the one person that wrote in and said th battery didnt fit as well. Its a little more snug, but its a great drill and Ive had it since the 80's. I'm getting another battery so I will now have two of these wrist saving gems.Paul"
2,I returned it,"I hoped that this product would be as advertised and I am sure that it is for many. After I dragged it onto my king-sized bed and laid down, I realized that the tufting was unbearable for me. I need a very smooth surface because I am sensitive to every lump and irregularity in my bed. I dragged it back off within 30 minutes. It took two people to box it back up and return it, but the company was very gracious and refunded my money."
4,woks fine for 6 months,battery will not last long but after i changed it the pen is working fine. it is looks good also. i like its withe color
1,Wrong Manual / Complicated ElectronicTool,"I found this translator to be too complicated to setup, especially since the manual was not for it specifically. Would send back if could, but the 7 day return period was not enough time for me to figure it out before leaving on my trip to 'old' Mexico. Now I have a translator I cannot figure out and cannot return. Do not recommend Unless you are a computer Guru/Nerd/Geek, etc. Very Disappointed!"
2,A gamble,"It is just a gamble if you get a good one or not. Just like the other reviewer I ordered two of them and got one good 3.7V 900mAh battery that works great and one weak 3.6V 600mAh battery that doesn't hold a charge.If you could get a good one every time it would be a good deal, but with about half of them betting junk it doubles the price."
2,Nice fit - Wrong Voltage,My original Samsung E-317 Battery is 1.7 volts and this replacement is only 1.6 volts. My phone wouldn't charge or turn on after installing this battery.
2,Rame and devoid of raughs,"Mr. Wong is a series of Flash cartoons made for the internet. Mr. Wong himself is an 85-year old Asian fella. He's Miss Pam's servant, and ""came with the estate,"" as the opening song states. The episodes run in the 3-4 minute range, but with the warning, intro, closing theme, and recap/preview, I'm probably seeing 2 minutes of original, new material per episode (the packaging states the disc runs 80 minutes). Am I supposed to be offended by Mr. Wong's portrayal? The show was unfunny, politically incorrect or not, although I've gotta say I loved the song ""Hockey Monkey"" by The Zambonis. Had nothing to do with the episode, of course. Also, there was a documentary about a Canadian guy who built a suit of armor (again, nothing to do with anything), which I found more entertainment value in than the show."
4,Great Find,"Ok, get over your politically correct self and get this DVD. Absolutely hilarious short episodes."
3,Too expensive.,"Doesn't go very far, but does the job. Have found it at a mom and pop hard wear store for$7.99, ace had it for $12"
1,horribly dated strategy,"this book does a lot of discussion about poker and the many unprovable truths it presents, but every strategy presented also presents with itself an optimal more powerful counter strategy.i've read many better organized strategy books, and find this to be more like the ramblings of an aging man.you could learn more about poker by simply playing."
2,Fisher Price Reader Backpack,"I have not seen this backpack but all the reviews mention the fact that it only holds three books and cartridges. We (my wife) found a backpack for the Fisher Price Reader that holds twelve books and cartridges. This backpack easily holds the books, cartridges, and the leap pad in one convenient place."
1,WAlalalalallala,YAYY HAPPY NEW YEARS EVRY1!!!!!!!dont buy this doll itz not good.. i have it.. its head got riped off by ma dawg.. do u thnk thats LASTLY!!! Nahh i didnt ETha!!!KK LYLAZ AND LYLAS AND LYL AND LYLAB!! AND LYA!!
5,BUY BUY BUY,"If it weren""t for Ellen I would have never found these talented 7 men.ALL WITHOUT MUSICAL INSTUMENTS and the vocals were awsome. You cannot gowrong with these guys. THEY WILL BE BIG. If your longing for Boys to Men were in shock, you will be relived with this AWSOME sound. Be good to your soul and add this to your collection. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEMTHANKS ELLEN YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION FOR US ALL. YOUR BIGGEST FAN..."
2,Love SMG but couldn't do it...,"This was part of a two-pack movie deal at Wal-mart for $10 about a year ago. It was attatched to a movie I had already seen and enjoyed and being a big Sarah Michelle Gellar fan, I took a chance and bought it. Tried watching it with a friend and after an hour shut it off. It was kind of terrible. Maybe one day I'll give it another chance but only because I love miss Gellar. The extra star is for her because she's fabulous!"
1,We RETURNED this movie to the local Blockbuster right away after finishing it,"We RETURNED this movie to the local Blockbuster right away after finishing it even though we could have kept it for 2 days. It's very slow, not suspenseful at all. The main character kept mutilating herself and saw strange people/ghosts. In spite of that, we never felt scared or related to her. We did felt asleep during the movie.We do like atmospheric horror like the Grudge or the Ring but this one is nothing like that. It's very bad B movie. What a waste of money! From now on, we won't rent any B movie any more."
3,SLOW PASTED & BORING!!!,"I just did rent it this flick. And I am glad I just rented first. Seeing the trailer, thought kind of scary, since ""Sarah Michelle Gellar"" in it, ..BUT far from it!! ..Trailer made it good and scary!, But Thriller/suspense more like it. But not that much a suspense either!!, Most the movie was real slow pasted ,,kind of put me in sleep, I was expecting getting better and more thrilling every minute ,But didn't cut it ,just lame & confusing ,Then most the flick was slow pasted and bored me!! In end, Unfold the whole scrip, so all confusing I had, came to climax. To me wasn't all that, I guess just ok flick as rental nothing really special about it , to buying this DVD, one time view of it, Then forgettable. C+"
1,interesting idea but.........,"it was carried out badly. I'm not going to do a synopsis, as you can find that above. You'd think Sarah Michelle Gellar would be better at picking out roles by now. My boyfriend and I found the movie to be boring. It dragged along and we ended up fast forwarding thru the 2nd 1/2 and still being able to keep up with the story completely. The cover art leads you to believe its a movie that is similar to the grudge. its not. its just plain boring."
2,Maybe OK for fans of M. Night Shyamalan,"Not really scary. Just loud noises and shots of speeding cars, a spinning fan, and sunsets. Oh, there must be some big shocker at the end, right? Not really. There is some notable cinematography and some decent music, but other than that, this wasn't even worth a rental for me."
1,The Return...of BOOORING!!!!,"How can so many people rate this as a good movie?!?!?It was downright horrible. It took over thirty minutes for any action to take place, if you want to consider her continuously walking to a bar as some action. Then a co-worker tries something with her, mind you, a CO-WORKER, whom she WORKS WITH. That just seemed like someone threw that scene in to show people that the main hero can fight.The characters seem to not have aged in 15 years since the accident, her father, and the hero she ends up sleeping with. Come on, absolutely no reason why anyone with good movie tastes should rent this. I did and it was an absolute waste of time."
3,battery jump,"thank you for all who posted the ""fix"" with the 9 volt battery. awesome!! that was a savings of roughly $80.00try it, it works!!"
2,Have it rebuilt at Batteries Plus,Have your battery packs replaced at Batteries Plus for half this price. The replacement cells are better than the originals. They use your old shell.
1,Milwaukee batteries are a bummer,"I purchased several 18-volt Milwaukee portable tools about a year ago. The tools are first-class. The batteries, on the other hand, only last about a year, regardless of how often you use them. Unless you are a heavy user of Milwaukee portable power tools, the expensive, short-life batteries make the investment not worthwhile."
1,"Dead Battery - 6months old, less than a dozen times of use!","I love the tools, however, the batteries, even if you don't use them go dead.Furthermore, even though they have improved how the battery clips to the tools, it takes a lot of effort at times to pinch the two sides to release the battery. My wife has never been able to change the battery on any of the tools in the combo kit I purchased. Now that the additional batteries I purchased much later are also going bad, very dissapointed.Given current experience with the batteries, I am phasing out Milwaukee's cordless tools (even though the tools perform great). No desire to try their new V28 batteries after my experience with these."
2,It's okay,"I only bought this cd because I love Foxy Brown and I wanted to get her song Big Bad Mamma. I also liked I Gotta Know by Playa. I'm giving it two stars, one for Big Bad Mamma, one for I Gotta Know. Those two songs were the best, however, I wasn't entertained with the rest of the songs, and I didn't like the movie."
2,Disappointed,"I was pleased when the pillow arrived. I enjoyed using it. Now, a few weeks later, It is flat and won't respond to ""plumping"". It is an expense it didn't need. I purchased it because it was recommended for fibromyalgia sufferers. I have purchased Better pillows at Walmart for a lot less money. I have ""been had"""
2,Is this girl really new????,"Funny... I've heard this girl before... I could have swornher name was Trisha Yearwood. My niece just got this and Iheard her playing in and I can't believe this girl is ""new""when really she sounds just like Trisha did when I actuallyenjoyed this type of stuff when I was younger. The thing isthat this girl really does nothing new or creative. It's thesame old stuff that Shania and other looks first female ""artist""have done for about 12 years now. Just another singer to blendit with the Shania and the others."
5,A GEM,"This book, along with many others written by the Scotsman, Ian Nicolson, is right at the top of my favorite boat maintenance/restoration/customization book list. He is thorough, imaginative, funny, (in a dry sort of way)and an experienced sailor and boatman. I have five of his books and I go to them frequently when I want to get clear instructions on how to make a change. (His pen and ink illustrations are terrific.) I plan to buy all of them when I come across them. Along with Daniel Spurr's Boatbook, Upgrading the Cruising Sailboat, and Marya and Paul Butler's book, Upgrading Your Small Boat for Cruising,(also excellent), you will surely find complete and well thought-out instructions for anything one could dream up to do to a sailboat to make it ""bluewater cruise worthy""."
2,An ok Design with flimsy Materials,I owned one of these and had it bolted to a 4x4 post on my porch. After a year the flimsy metal the frame is made of started to bend. I hammered it back into position and then braced it with some scrap wood I had lying around. About 6 months later the handle cover ripped off and six months after that the handle mechanism ripped itself off of the frame. If I saw this in a dollar store I would not buy it again. Look elsewhere for a quality product.
2,Good at first.,"This crusher worked great at first. But after about a month, it began to wobble and come off track. While it still worked, it was just difficult to use. After about another month, the whole unit began to fall apart. Company won't help, either. It's good for the start, but after a few months, not so good."
3,All Reviews Written by Author and Friends,"Help! Can we get a real review here? 5 Stars by everyone and each happens to be in a major city geographically spread out across the country. New York, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and Seattle. Hmm, where are the ones from San Diego and Miami? No specific details in any review, and each way too ""flowery"" and ""salesy"".Here is one from Binghamton, NY.""I just don't believe it. Too good to be true. I read every book and every book review as part of my job. It's my job to be cynical. I may actually review the book and provide real examples of meat or sewage rather than try to sell the book or Giese's seminar to you. Overall, the other reviews are good sales fluff absent of any benefits tied to direct examples.""Joe Obvious"
4,The best price around,I am in charge of buying the products that are needed for our maintenance department. These were the ones they needed and you had the best price. Thanks for your help.
5,you already knew this,"what's to review? you already have the Millwaukee tool; you know it is the best on the market, or you wouldn't be buying a replacement battery fo it. Amazon's price is right, and the product is OEM. 'Nuf said."
2,14.4 volt battery Milwaukee,"I have had three of these batteries fail in only two years of very light use. Probably less than 40 hrs. of total use between the three batteries. The tool is great, but the batteries are poor."
1,Do not buy unless you want to ruin your things,"We purchased this item for our move to England, and as soon as we got there, I tried the power converter with the vacuum. After a few minutes of use, the vacuum began smoking and will no longer work. A few months later, my son tried to use his xbox with the power converter, set it to the high setting (which is the right one for the 250 watt xbox) and as soon as he plugged it in, the fuse in the xbox blew. We had to buy a new vacuum, and we do not know what we are going to do with the Xbox."
3,Its ok,I tried it and did not really like it. It is easy and easy to follow (which is nice ) but I bearly broke a sweat I can get more of a work out doing my 10min platies. So if you need a low impact workout dvd this is the one for you.
1,Obnoxious dance moves and music,"I bought this at the same time as Dance Blast: 10 minute workouts with Jennifer Galardi. This one is so cheesy. I hate the moves, they seem really outdated and the instructor is older and not motivating for me. I love the Dance Blast DVD. Much better music and moves."
2,Not very good or easy,"Didn't care for this one- too much twisting in the lower back. Didn't really feel like a workout, either. Was very disappointed. I do not recommend this video."
3,Excellent Series. But Transfer to DVD Only Fair,"Great story lines and fine acting, which is what we have come to expect from this series. But too many of the scenes are contrasty and dim, with the characters often merely shadows and recognizable only by their voices."
1,Not happy,"I was not happy with this product, so returned it and bought the World Cuisine model instead. I just love it for zucchini and yellow squash ""noodles"" to use in place of pasta. It is fun, too."
2,Flimsy,The blade is too small and the plastic is too brittle.Basically you can only cut cucumbers with this thing.
1,no instructions cannot get to work correctly.,"I purchased the product to make ribbons out of cucumber and spiral spiral like seen in the picture veggies. Could not get to work just made mush out of my cucumber, and will cheap packaging and no instruction whatsoever is worthless to me. I tried to do squash and carrots also did not work for me. Also when I first looked at it the plastic near one of the blades looked like the blade might fall off of it. I do not recomend it at all. Would appericate any help anyone has as to how to use this thing......."
4,Very Suitable General Purpose Tool Bag,"I have owned Milwaukee tools and accessories for many years. This tool bag was the right size to hold minor maintainance tools and parts. I found the construction to be more than sturdy and durable. The opening is the exact size of the interior, so what fits through it will come out without putting it on an angle- especially useful for the 1 1/8"" box open wrench which always migrates to the bottom. The zipper is the super heavy type with self repairing teeth- not bad for those of us who are not too careful where we go or what abuse we heap on our carriers. I would like the bag to have two zippers, but it's not a real inconvenience. The side pockets and end pockets are good sizes and fold back when not used. overall this bag is a well built, excellent quality carry-all which I would gladly seek out again if this one were lost or destroyed (my job involves some risky situations)."
1,Where's The Original Music?,"I WISH I had read the reviews on Amazon about the removal of the original music score, before I bought all three seasons of this great TV series. I struggled through the pilot episode of Season One last night. Without the original music score, Tour Of Duty has no ambiance, and it's going to be very difficult to watch all three seasons listening to that really atrocious generic music score that Sony substituted in place of the original music.Can I curse, pull out my hair and rend my garments now? What a huge disappointment!!!"
1,"tour of duty,,complete second season","i just received my tour of duty complete second season ,upon opening it i found it to be missing disc 2 is this typical ,what must i do to get the #2 disc"
3,There are two versions of this collection,"The box I received had the same cover design, but with the caption ""Over 12 Hours!"" It contains only 10 movies, with the missing one being ""The Fatal Hour."" Why would they do this?"
2,Dissapointment,"Those who are expecting horror films will be dissapointed, because none of these films are even remotely scary at all. Tower of London and The Black Castle are the closest things to horror films in this set. It is NOT WORTH the suggested retail price. Get it used for cheap. Do not pay full price for it, because it is not worth it. Boris is a great actor, but in most of these films his roles are very small. The Bela Lugosi collection is the superior collection. This set is forgettable."
1,Horror that's painful to read,"I am very surprised with the 5 start ratings for this book. I am a true fan of horror, and there's no denying that Ed Lee has written some pretty gruesome stuff. But this book is painfully boring and uninteresting. There is absolutely no character developement or depth. The dialogue is usually ridiculous and I completely agree with the other reviewer about the many storyline blunders. I thought Monstrosity was a good read but this is awful."
4,Great DVD set,"We started watching this series on television well after it had begun, so we missed the first four series. It's a very enjoyable mystery program, and it has been good to watch it from the beginning whenever we want. Being a British show, sometimes it's hard to understand the dialect, but we can rewind and relisten, or even watch an entire show again to catch all of the subtle nuances which abound in addition to clarifying some words. I bought this for my husband's birthday because I knew he was a fan, and we have enjoyed every show. I would have given it five stars except for the fact that we could find no closed captioning availibility that would help clarify some British mumbling. Great set! Can't wait to buy 5 and 6."
1,Good Movie; Incomplete movie on DVD,"This is one of my favourite movie by Gulzar. Great performances by Sanjeev Kumar, Waheeda Rehman, Shabana Azmi and others.But the DVD is completely an insult to the movie as it does not contain the entire movie. The DVD has a running time of 112 minutes where the movie is over 2.5 hours long. missing almost half the movie.This DVD would have been must keep if it was complete! alas"
3,Average game,"This game is ok it has awasome grapichs for they year it came out,but thats the only thing thats cutting edge though.If you played city life youll think this is pretty striaght forward or if you play simcity that will help a little becuase they are related in a way.There are no taxes you make money by selling for expample tourist/vaction you most likey going to sell souverners or fishing towns sell fish and etc... The buildings only live a short while and i dont like that idea becuasre you will forget what was there and if it was inportant.The good:wonderful graphics,not too conplex nor too simple,load time is short.The bad: building only live a short while and they auto get destroyed so you forget what was there,the toutorials are a waste of time,basically it has ups and downs its not style over substance like sim city 4 but its not as good as the good ones like sim city 3000 or city life."
4,Excellent,This an excellent book!Makes you feel like your right there with Kia and Ryushi.I love it! Thanks for thinking up such a great book idea!
2,Sound Quality Not Great,"Bought this cordless phone with good expectations, but I was let down by the sound quality. The greeting and the messages are kinda muddy sounding, also, the message playback volume starts low at the beginning then moves to the normal volume level. This means the first word of your greeting or message can be hard to understand or even lost. This is annoying. I've tried cheaper models in the past that handle messages better.The sound quality when I'm speaking to someone is only average at best, and when I talk a little loud I can hear some distortion. I'm taking this phone back to the store and getting another, perhaps AT&T; or Panasonic."
1,Buy this phone only if you live in a shoebox!,PROS: I'll be nice enough to say that the phone is we built and looks good with the simple dark casing and bright orange backlit display.CONS:(1) This phone lacks volume in the earpiece(2) This phone lacks range. Buy this phone only if you live in a shoebox and don't want to talk outside of it. Our older 2.4 panasonic with its broken case and antenna still out performs it.(3) This phone lacks in the digital voicemail department also. Trust me... My GE cassete ans. machine would class in at this level only with a used tape.All I have to say is never let your parent buy a cordless phone in a superstore unless you equip them with the exact make and model that you need.Simply said... in the cordless world... you go Panasonic then Uniden or else!
4,Good tool to overcome intentional obstacle by manufacturers.,"It does what it is supposed to do very well. A bit pricey, but then it is a specialty tool no shade-tree mechanic should be without. Used on 2001 Sable successfully."
3,Depressing,"I can't say if I enjoyed it or not, the ending was so sad. It certainly made me think more about my future and how I need to start ""making room for tomorrow""."
4,Excellent small duffel,Good small bag. Easily holds my toiletry kit and a change of clothes. Compartments are sizable and open easily. Very pleased with my choice to buy this product.
2,i would not buy this again,"While i liked the style with the pockets and water bottle pouch, the bag is not made well. Zippers have broken. Fabric has torn in the seams. The Shoulder strap has stretched out"
3,Not really a work out video,"I really liked Sera, and the movements and dancing are beautiful, but this is not going to work as a work out video for me. First, it is too long, definately over an hour long. Second, there are chapters in the DVD, but it wasn't set up like separate workouts. Once you press play on the DVD, all the chapters just play in succession, so it would not be easy to break up the work out into smaller time chunks without feeling like I was stopping in the middle. Lastly, it seemed more like an instructional/educational video than an exercise video. There were a lot of very small movements and repeating of movements during the explanations. Again, it is not that I didn't like her or how she was teaching, it was just that the program as a whole was too long that it would be impracticle for me to try to incorporate it into my work-out routine. I think this DVD would be great for someone who has larger chunks of time and really wants to learn belly dancing."
4,Excellent tale of urban horror.,"This is a brilliant tale of modern horror that totally eschews any of the usual trappings of things that go bump in the night and instead focuses on the cruelty and nasty possibilties of everyday life. The death of one of the lead characters halfway through the book is pretty hard hitting mainly due to Campbells excellent descriptive technique, you almost feel as if you know the family. As with all Campbells novels you finish this book with the satisfaction of knowing you have just read a well written novel by an important novellist."
4,Just for Anda-Louise Bogza,"If not any thing else - this dramatic soprano is worth it.In many illustrious versions of Leonora, including Antonietta Stella's famous version with Carlo Bergonzi - the all-Italian version, it is hard to find the like of Mrs. Bogza.Hers is the drama, the gut-feelings, the beautiful tone...the tragic Verdian heroine.Otherwise, I would say that my other Serafin 'Il Trovatore' won the day.But for Bogza's Leonora."
3,It's a Gift,This three-book set was a gift for my nephew. I'm sure he is loving it... he sure loves to read.
2,Poor quality item,"I got this for christmas and I must say, it's one of the worst things i've gotten in recent memory. The product is cheaply made with low quality parts and terrible button placement, especially on the d-pad. The most important part of a product is to be able to navigate through it, and a traditional d-pad would've been great, but instead it's a cluster of buttons. Which one of mine is faulty by the way; so in the video games I put on it; it's extremely hard to control. The one good thing about this product is it has a great video player and nice screen clarity, but use headphones with volume control, because this doesn't have any means of changing the volume. It's either loud; or off."
2,cold water on demand,"We really wanted to love this product. Compact, all in one, easy 1 pound propane using, actively pumped water, adjustable heat, on/off easy. Hot shower in the woods. Sounds great! We used it at an off grid cabin, so it was not getting beat around or bounced around in the back of my 4wd truck. Great Concept BUT Extremely Poor Execution. This product is unfortunately an epic FAIL. I wanted it to work so bad, I bought three of these. Each one failed. The heater failed on each one after short periods of use. Cold water on demand. Zero for three."
2,Not quite what I expected.,"It was sent packaged well and on time. However, it does not stack well and it easily knocka over. The lids do not lock on so if it falls over, everything spills out. Not happy with product."
4,handle with care,"Mantis Compost Thermometer #201101These are tricky to handle; if you so much as twist the dial getting the thermometer out of the package it won't work very well, if at all. Instead, hold the thermometer by the probe. I use 2 of these in the barn to measure the temps on my hay bales and when handled correctly, they give very accurate temperature readings."
1,"Zero, if I could!!","I teach how to compost in my high school class. I have other compost thermometers, but needed more. In my search, I came across these (Mantis 201101). I bought three based on the positive feedback. Wrong choice. One thermometer never worked. It took about three more uses for the other two to stop. Like a previous reviewer stated, the rod somehow turns and the dial turns along with it. I buy almost everything from Amazon. I never have a problem. I fully depend on the reviews, but never gave one. I felt that it was necessary for the buyers to know that these are junk and that Amazon did not stand behind them!!"
5,Simply the Best ONE,"I have known this version of Messiah since my early childhood in the 'sixty's. You need to remeberthis is Scripture set to music. In making this both Handel and those you hear on the recording have affirmed my belief in both beautiful music and Our Lord Jesus Christ. You experience both the spiritual and sublime here.Mr Ormandy with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have brought the highest Praise and Glory ever known on Earth to God in this presentation. I am not am expert in the music of this, I am a consumer who is now 51 and blessed by it every time I hear it."
5,Handel Messiah,This is a great CD the combination of The Philidelphia Orchestra and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir makes for wonderful listening.
1,80's T&A,80's T&A B movies. That's not the problem. Poorly packaged for shipping. Case arrived broken.
5,Bought For My 20 Year Old,"I had heard about this book from a pastor that I hear often on the radio. I have a son who is in jail, and will probably be going to prison soon. My son has asked many questions about God, and this book helped him to settle many of them. As small as this book is, as old as this book is, it is still timely and relevant today."
3,"Great message, just hard to read","There is no doubt that JC Ryle is a fantastic author, and that this book holds time tested, fantastic advise for all young men, but this version is very hard to read. That's the only reason for the 3 stars and not 5. You can find other translated versions that convert the language of Mr.Ryle's day to a more modern translation. If you like great Christian writers than I think you may like [...] check it out!!"
4,Useful in the bathroom/office/desk drawer,"This is a pretty solid product.I needed something to organize my odds and ends floating around my desk.This is simple, fits in most drawers...obviously check the dimensions.4 stars because I feel it's priced a tad high, I would probably buy this again if I needed another one."
4,Normal Guy,"No issues so far, works fine. The stickers that come on the product are a bit difficult and aggravating to remove however, I think I still have some sticker residue on the side somewhere."
1,UGH!,"THIS TIME AROUND, A COP [DANIEL BERNHARDT] INFILTRATES A PRISON TO INVESTIGATE THE ONGOING EXECUTIONS OF THE INMATES AT THE PRISON. SUDDENLY, HIS COVER IS BLOWN AND HE FINDS HIMSELF FIGHTING TO SURVIVE IN THE KUMITE. THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING. THE ACTING IS BAD, THE FIGHTS ARE CORNY, AND THE SCRIPT REALLY SUCKS. VAN DAMME LOOKALIKE DANIEL BERNHARDT IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MARTIAL ARTIST THAT KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT, BUT SERIOUSLY HAS PROBLEMS ENTERTAINING AN AUDIENCE. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WHY COULDN'T THERE JUST BE ONLY ONE BLOODSPORT MOVIE? WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE SEQUELS? FROM WATCHING THIS MOVIE, I ALMOST DON'T WANNA SEE PART 2 OR 3. EVEN IF YOU ARE A MARTIAL ARTS FAN LIKE MYSELF, YOUR BEST BET IS TO AVOID THIS ONE ENTIRELY."
3,limited uses,"this tool is almost too small. i have found very few uses where a simple cut-off wheel would not do just as well. the accessory does a fine job when you do find the right situation, however."
1,mini- junk,"this mini saw, was usless, the saw guard was in the way,and you could not remove it, this guard, made it impossible to cut the small pices of wood where you made your mark,who ever disigned this had a good idea, but never though it through, or may have not tried it, or tested it now I think it is JUNK>"
4,Great book,"I love this book. Lots of great info.The only issue I have is, the author must be a vegetarian, and th ebiased shows through. She suggests limiting meat consumption due to antibiotics, etc. in the meats. What she fails to do is suggest comsuming organic meats instead.Other than that, great book! I love it and use it ALLLLL the time."
4,Very good information,"Even my husband was reading stuff in this book. But like anything else, take it all with a grain of salt realizing the author's bias and 'favorites' are included."
4,Lots of good info,"Although written in 2002, this book answers a lot of questions I had about all the vitamins & supplements available. It explains about vitamins, enzymes, antioxidants, minerals, amino acids & herbs. There is a good section on basic nutrition that should be required reading."
4,Great fit and lenght,Great product for the replacement of my lost one. Make sure you check how many prongs you have on the plug end though.
2,Not enough to get certified,This book was not enough for me. This book offers a basic overview of security and does not prepare for the exam. I wish I had used an additional source for the exam.
3,Don't be fooled by all the stellar reviews.....,"Don't be fooled by all the stellar reviews. Although this book is good, it has many faults. First off, I just took the Security+ exam and narrowly passed. The reason - there was a good deal of material on the exam that was never covered in this book. Additionally, the practice exams provided in this book contain questions that are much easier than those on the real test. I took all the practice tests and never missed more than 2 on any of them (even the big one in the book). As an example the book made an issue of the common port numbers - it failed however to communicate to me that the actual test would contain multiple questions concerning less common ports - i.e. LDAP, SSH, etc. Finally, it is noteworthy that this book contains many spelling and grammar problems. In order to feel confident about passing this test, you need more than is in this book - especially better practice exams."
2,Poor value for the cost and the limited information.,"First, this book is not ""encyclopedia"" in size in terms of either pages or dimensions. After the introduction, acronyms and time line the reader will find 328 pages of information, followed by a limited bibliography and a detailed index. The body of the book largely consists of biographies of deceased mob bosses and henchmen, which are available in more detail in Robert Jay Nash's less expensive reference books on organized crime. The limited unique information available here, and not found elsewhere, would not justify the cost of $75 to most true crime buffs."
5,Fantastic Reading for Girls of All Ages,I remember reading this series as a girl and have now bought them for my 7 and 5 year-old girls. I look forward to reading a chapter or two with them every night! The stories are beautifully told and the values and morals taught in them are timeless. It is my hope that these books help to strengthen my girls' faith while they entertain them.
1,Not so good,"Although the game ran pretty fast, the graphics were still horrible, even for a bargain price. I found the plot to be good, but the game itself was not good. It was loaded with glitches and problems that malfunctioned the game."
3,a bloody crack-filled chase!,"I still don't know if I enjoyed this book or not. Stahl obviously used to be a crack head or just did some up-close-and-personal research. If you have never smoked crack before and were thinking about trying, read this book! It will kick your curiosity instantly. Not one likeable character in the entire book, and too many impossible coincidences. However, I was hooked, once I got into it I wanted to see how Stahl was going to end it. Even though it took him a little too long to do so. The really only believable part in the book was dubbahya's photo. The only positive(?) thing I came out of this book with was a vote for Nader."
2,"So-so, not that great.","I read only half this book - that's where it should've logically ended. It started off great, I loved the style but as I kept going on and on, the hilarity of two crack addicts and a cop who's fallen in love with his prime suspect in a quirky town in America lost it's flavor. True, I should've finished it, but, well, don't take my word for it."
2,It's fine for a while then starts to bore you.,"The game itself explains it all, there are no good leads to this game & the features aren't that great in here. While people might find new matches(only 1) to be interesting, theres not much here to find that is fun. You might find other stuff from other WWE games to be fun but this game for some reason has a lot of flaws from the beginning. It's only a matter of time before this game will definately go pawned, sold, trashed, crushed, or whatever but will on that for games like this is not much for to be desired on. You want the best Smackdown game then get Smackdown, might be old but an instant classic with best features. That game also never gets boring."
4,saw,Excellent product. It does have one drawback and that is safety. I performs just as I expected. I removes excess material on my hobby products fast and efficientlsy
2,Dog chews,"Should be called dog crunchies....Chews imply they will last longer than 3 seconds...they are brittle, not chewy like tendons I have previously purchased. While the dogs like the taste, they do not offer any chew time."
4,"Package damaged, but product ok","The box the transfer kit came in was severely damaged. I was amazed the product inside was ok, but it was. Everything works fine."
4,Great Compost Maker; Good Be of Better Quality Materials,"Mantis 4000-00-02 ComposT-Twin Composting BinAssembled Easter weekend. Hand crank not in package. Ordered crank that came a week or so later. Makes compost quickly. As a novice, I made good compost within 6 weeks; am doing better now watering more frequently--keeping it damp as a sponge.Delighted with the compost and the concept that two bins can be composting on different time cycles.Problems: one of four door clips has broken. One of four door ""hinges"" is beginning to fracture. I can forgive the clip, but believe the doors, of which the hinges are simply a bent part, should have been made of more durable steel."
2,Doors are pathetic. Should have lifetime warranty.,"My ""guy"" is about 8 years old and the hinges which you have to struggle to put in place while battling the blazing sun and hoards of insects flying out, have rusted away. So now I am stuck with their price gouging for replacement doors. They could have designed a hinge that stands up to the made in USA pride, not made in China ha ha we tricked you quality."
3,crappy closures,"Love love loved it UNTIL.... the latches broke after 2 weeks, contacted mantis and they replaced them asap (same type) and again after one or two flips of the clasps they broke too. very well built and great design except for the clasps on the doors we tried to install our own hasps but the curve of the barrels make it impossible. Also when it rains it fills the tubs so when you rotate the handle about 30 or more gallons of putrid rotting water pour out and attract mice like crazy. The material took about one year to break down completely but it was a total mud nightmare. I did like the fact you could ALMOST put a wagon under it to collect the contents. I would not pay so much for that type of composter again."
5,Perfect!!!,"This was to replace a bad cord on a Milwaukee Magnum Drill. All I can say is I just disconnected the original cord and plugged the new cord into the drill and it was as good as new. This cord was an exact fit. Best of all the repair was less the 20 bucks, well worth it!!!"
1,Ordered wrong item,This would rate 5 stars if it was the right item. They don't mention that there is more than one type of Milwaukee connection for this sort of plug. Order carefully.
5,Great replacement remote,This is a great replacement if the one you have stops working. It works better then the original
3,replacment solution for the original remote,"I have been using this remote for close to a year in my truck to XM channel surf and keeping an eye on the road.From day one, there was a slight delay, the channel doesn't change instantly. Over time, the buttons are worn down because now I have to ""mash"" the keys to get an input.I haven't found another good replacement. I dislike the original remote because is it small and even harder to use so given my options, I have learned to live with this remote but wish there was a better product out there.I'm currently researching programmable remotes that are small enough to be used in my vehicle that could replace this remote.I would recommend this remote ONLY because there's nothing better out there, and it is certainly an improvement over the original one."
4,Mantis Sifter,Very useful with the Mantis composter. Products arrived in a timely fashion and the delivery folks were very accomodating
3,buy this toy,"It has alot of cool gear that can go on it.even though it's durable I wouldn't sugest throwing it on the ground. Educationaly this toy is a toy gun,but you can be creative with it."
3,GI Joe Sigma 6 Switchfire Multi-Mode Blaster,Finally a role play toy from gi joe! Not only that but it looks awsome.Now when I play gi joe I don't have to use a cheap dollar store gun.It is very durable. My over all rating is 5.
4,worked great for me,"I don't know why all the bad reviews on this. Maybe it worked for me because I have a high end dremel. A bench grinder might be faster, but I don't have a bench. As for people not getting their blade to fit I don't see how that's even possible unless they got the lawn mower kit with the garden tool sharpening kit and used the wrong guide."
1,The only Dremel accessory I've ever returned,"The concept behind this accessory is good but the implementation is poor. The plastic adapter that positions the grindstone at the correct angle to the blade is subject to not fitting the blade because one size does not fit all. Also, the adapter is made of a hard plastic that easily wears down as it is drawn across the lawnmower blade. The grindstone is small and while spinning at high speed multiple passes are required to grind off much metal at all. Dremel used to have a commercial that made the process of blade sharpening using this accessory to be a breeze ... it is not.The easiest was to sharpen a lawnmower blade is by using an inexpensive bench grinder."
1,Not worth it,It broke before half of the first blade was sharpened. Very disappointed. The plastic just snapped right in half under light pressure.
1,"""Where's the Beef?!!""","Having read most of the books by and about Corbett, and all the reviews about'Master of the Jungle' here, I agree with those who gave the book a single star rating. The author's imaginationwas so high, it was sickening. Corbettand sister Maggie were never attackedby the natives before they left India;in reality they wept. Jim didn't pack his belonging into a horse wagon, they were loaded into a truck to be taken to the nearest railway station-Ramnagar. Jim and Maggie arrived at the station intheir own car, and he donated this car to the Forest dept. These are all documented in various books and journals,but it appears that the author and the publisher took the easy street to produce this book. Like one of the critics mentioned here, with apologies to Grafton Novels; I will also give the book a 'R' rating: R is for Recall orR is for Recycle!"
1,"disappointing, and feel betrayed","a fiction biography, naturally filled with more imagination than trut"
4,Good purchase,"I purchased this product as an organizer for my kitchen counter to organize bills, letters, and magazines. I wanted something that would organize without looking tacky. The unit was a little too tall to fit under my cabinets, all assembled, so I ended up taking off the 2 bottom letter trays, and using those in a different spot, to make it a little shorter. This would be perfect for an office! It seems sturdy and so far, it has worked well."
4,Epic in Scope,"This is the quintessential starting point for the Green Lantern universe, and it starts out with a bang. With a lot of foreshadowing, great action scenes, a nicely rounded conclusion, and a lot of great cameos, the book sets you up for some of the greatest Green Lantern books to come over the next few years. Geoff Johns loves the characters, and he proves that with this book, and all that follow in Volume 4. Great start, good art, dangerously addictive story."
2,The only attraction is the price,"The price of this book is excellent for college students since it's not even more than $20, but I don't recommend it to those who really have a passion to learn Japanese in an efficient way. Its romanized Japanese text is the worst thing of this book, now in my 2nd level class I found out that the majority of my classmates either still use romanized words rather than hiragana/katakana, or have difficulty reading kana, or both. The other bad things of this book are that it's not up-to-date and the vocabularies are not in dictionary form. Fortunately I have been learning Japanese on my own with some other materials, otherwise I could have learned not much."
3,Not as bad as some,"While the first volume of Learn Japanese has no glossary and is written only in romanji, the other three volumes have both. If you get this book or any book, get the tapes too. Otherwise it will do you little good. I used all four volumes when I was learning Japanese. It seems to be as good or better than any of the others I`ve used. Unfortunately, it is full of the supposed cultural explainations for the Japanese which were and are exaggerations or nonsense. (This sort of stuff is typical with 1980s books on Japan which were dwelling on the supposed uniquness of Japanese culture. Uniquly unique. Things such as the Japanese' deep relationship with nature and other silliness.) As a language book, I used them in college with a good teacher and a bad teacher. THe teacher had greater influence on learning than the book. Maybe there are others better--there are many worse--but a search for the perfect book to learn a language will always be a fruitless search."
2,disappointed,"too many glossy pictures,short on tecqnique, i have not had good luck with yan's books, although i love him on tv????,he just does not put in his books what he does on tv????"
4,OK,"These are OK. Nothing to talk about really. These foils do the job. They fit nicely. It hasn't been that long so I can't really judge the ''longevity'' of the product, but I CAN say that they didn't fall apart after one use. :)"
4,No issues,I fits the razor and seems to have the same lifetime as the original screen. So nocomplaints so far.
2,Hard to Understand,This is my first time with Paint Shop Pro and I found Sams Teach Yourself Paint Shop Pro in 24 hours was very hard to follow. More illustrations are needed so the reader can more fully understand how to use the Paint Shop Pro program. Some things just are not clear per his instructions.
2,Not as great as I expected,I was a little disappointed with the condition of my book. The front corner of the cover was clipped off...no mention of this in the product description.
2,Aussie WalkAbout Grill,"I should've listened to the first reviewer! I've seen the grille before and liked it enough, so that's not the problem...It came with a dented lid and the handle was broken into a dozen pieces. Hmmm...I wonder if I got the first reviewer's return!? This grille was shipped asembled in a taped up make shift carton that was not the manufacturer,s. I guess I'll see how easy it will be to return."
3,Not up to par,"First off, this is a serving board, not a cutting board.It's very thin so it's not meant for meat prep or any heavy cutting.But all of that is beside the fact that the quality of this board is just... low.First of all the glue issue is a big issue for me.I got the sticker off but the glue took a lot of scrubbing and now the board has a big spot on it. To top it off the board cracked right down the middle.I take care of my cutting boards, hand wash them and oil them.I have a bamboo cutting board that is in excellent condition and is used very frequently.Unfortunately this one was a waste of money, I had it for about a month and then threw it away when the crack showed up."
2,unhappy,Pretty to look at until you start to cut on it.Very visible scratches from each cut of the knife. Don't buy it.
1,An Intro and footnotes -- Zero History Content,"The big problem with this book is its misleading title:""Ancient Palestine: A Historical Introduction"". Do you think you might get some history? Nay not so. This is merely 50+ pages of discussion explaining how difficult it is to get a true picture of ancient history. Good only for sending to a hard shell fundementalist who firmly believes every word in the Bible is gospiel truth. Lots of references to where the bible can't be historical accurate. Following what would be an introduction in a normal book, there is a page or two of one line chronological listings of historical periods. Thats it. If you think you are going to get a summary of Palestine History - you will be as shocked and disappointed as I was."
4,poor ol creighton chaney...,"these inner sanctum mysteries all cling to very similar concepts,and as such they are quite predictable but,there is a certain noirish charm about them.i kinda feel that lon chaney is severely miscast and consequently it is difficultto suspend my disbelief in the premise of each movie.however,i didn't buy these cause they were great movies.i bought em because i suffer from insomnia and they help me go to sleep...lol."
5,It's about time ! Great fun !,"These films used to be on TV all the time. I was amazed at how clever the plots were. I didn't remember some of them. ""Weird Woman"" is my favorite ""B-film"" and I'm always recommending it to people. Movies used to be so entertaining ! It's great to have this collection available to film fans. We can overlook Chaney's stiffness, as the rest of the cast really compensates for it."
1,Horrible Robot Toy!,"This robot is the worst! He doesn't work at all. I sent him back two different times and then finally I just got a refund of my money because of all of the trouble. The people who gave this robot five stars may need their heads examined! This robot sat in the charger for hours and when we took him off the charger he wouldn't follow commands as stated and my girls (8, 9) became frustrated and I just asked Amazon to refund this piece of junk!"
4,Restless Dead...DOA,"I ordered the Restless Dead for its 1st ed WarHammer significance. I was not disappointed! A great read! An even better play through! My gaming group loved it! The story line, the plot development and the characters are all fantastically done! One of the best modules I have run (and I have been gaming for 35+ years!!). A Great read as well as awesome play-ability. I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in fantasy gaming."
1,this book stinks!,"Boring, in one simple word. There is no humor to be found in the bland writing and illustrations. I was very disappointed with the entire book. Well, the Title is pretty good, but that is all that it has going for it. Adults who enjoy cartoons and comics will not find this as entertaining, and it definetly has enough vulgar language in it."
5,This book rocks!,"I was reading this on the subway and drinking some Sprite and I laughed so hard that Sprite came out of my nose. That might not have made the other people on the train so happy, but I was too busy laughing to notice. I promise if you read this you'll laugh really really hard, too, but you probably should stay away from carbonated beverages for a while."
3,This...is Uncomprehendable,"David Rees was bored at work. So bored that he occupied his time creating comics from out of PowerPoint using the cheesy clipart graphics. He started faxing those comics to his friends, who, of course, forwarded them to their friends. Those who love ""Office Space"" can appreciate his ingenuity.His book, ""My New Fighting Technique is Unstoppable"" (or MNFTIU for those in the know), chronicles the adventures of a group of martial arts fiends -- they can't wait to fight one another -- with strange names and stranger powers. Egging each other on with profane taunts full of teenage bravado, they fight to show each other the inside of ambulances.These comics can't be explained; they are so out-of-this-world, much like Gary Larsen's ""Far Side"". Knowing that they were made with clipart makes it all the more hilarious.Visit www.unstoppable.com to join the fun."
5,The Butter Battle Book,This book shows that even such a small difference like if you eat toast with the butter side up of down can cause a lot of trouble. People kill because of tiny differences like skin color of what you believe in. Dr. Seuss shows what can happen in a playful way that appeals to the kids
5,Another enjoyable sermon,"It's one of Seuss's later works, written in the 1980s. It presents, in kid-friendly idiom, the inane causes of war. Although presented as silliness, the conflict rapidly escalates through successively goofier armaments. The end shows the entire populace descending into underground shelters with the Big-Boy Boomeroo about to be launched by both sides at once.The presentation is Seussish and silly, a real contrast to his hawkish WWII editorial cartoons. Still, it's grimly familiar to anyone who lived in the 1950s and 60s. Bomb shelters and the threat of mutually assured destruction were daily realities then, and their memory is still sharp. Maybe, if kids see insanity early enough, they'll learn to avoid it. At worst, they'll have yet another of Seuss's charming stories behind them.//wiredweird"
4,Somewhat dated,"Given the end of the cold war, this book seems a little out of date, but there continue to be valuable lessons about escalation and defining people that are different as enemies.I would recommend the Sneetches, rather than the butter battle book."
2,good but not for a vs starter,I'm looking a visual studio book which really explain what is going on with Visual Studio from how to use it to what is really happening behind the scenes. This books DOES NOT do this.
3,"Misleading title. Should be called ""Visual Studio .NET Hacks"".","Very good book on Visual Studio. However readers should be aware that most of the content is geared towards .NET (i.e., Visual Basic .NET and Visual C#). There is little C++ content inside. If you read the blurbs on the back cover the author states that these are .NET hacks. So readers hoping to find a plethora of C++ related hacks should look elsewhere. But if it's .NET you're after this book is one of the best."
2,Mountain Biking in Arizona,This book is for much more technical areas for mountain biking than we wanted. We wanted gentle trails instead of hard-core trails which is what this book entails.
2,whole lot of nothing,"This thing weighs in at a whopping 19 ounces. Way too much paper filler with all sorts of peripheral information about mountain biking in general, but not enough specific details about the best Arizona trails. The maps were done with a GPS, but a gray line drawn by a computer over a b&w topo that covers only 1/4 page just does not get it. You've probably heard the expression that a camel is a horse designed by committee. This is a book written by a knowledgable mountain biker then stuffed into the Falcon/Globe-Pequot format. This fomulaic (sp?) approach to a mountain bike guide just doesn't work. The local guides and maps are cheaper, better and lighter."
5,Going My Way/Holiday Inn,"Going My Way/Holiday InnI bought this because I love old movies and loved this copy. A must for Music Lovers.Thanks,Dana"
3,"Chatter, chatter, chatter",I own many of Leslie Sansone's walking videos and this is one I really don't like. She just talks too much! She talked so much she didn't allow you to slide easily into the next step. Don't recommend.
3,The ideas in this book would be a good start for a new book,"The spirit of this book is great, but it is a discredit to the publishing industry (more than the author) in the form published. I found the experimental, data-driven approach wonderful compared to virtually all the time management and personal productivity books I have ever read.Unfortunately, as published it is a late draft that still needs editing. At least one chapter needs to be dropped. Several sections are confusing. For example there are places where the author promises to make four points, but it is not clear after several readings of the following pages what the points were.I may decide to write the better book that this one should have been myself. Now all I need is a publisher. Anyone ?"
5,How Refreshing,How refreshing. Just as I was about to give up hope of seeing any musical talent on the AMA awards show Carbon Leaf comes on and steals the show. I cannot attest to any cut on this album except The Boxer. If the balance of this disc is anything like The Boxer then we that have been turned on to CL will be able to brag to all of our friends that we know of this band way back when...
5,Trading In the Zone,"Trading In the Zone, by Ari Kiev, should be an essential component of very trader's arsenal. In this book, Dr. Kiev discusses the role emotions and psychological factors play in the realm of trading. His success is demonstrated in his ability to portray actual case studies and transfer his work into a dialogue that makes it easy for the reader to identify with. Whether a beginner or an experienced trader, Trading in the Zone provides the necessary material to become a more focused and grounded trader."
3,Good but not great,"Not practical enough. Good first book to read though. It points out common issues, but doesn't really provide a framework to fix them. Daily trading coach fills that gap nicely."
1,Save your money,"Get your self a pair of scissors as it will save you time and do a better job, and save you money."
1,Monster Cutters,My husband used these cutters on his weed thrasher and the cutters were breaking off. I thought these are the cutters for the weed thrasher. My husband said his last cutters were red. Does this make a difference because these cutter said they were for the weed thrasher.
5,"Hypnosis: Smile on your face, money in your pocket",I found Dr. Stockwell's book to be both well written and informative. An excellent guide and outline for the study and practice of hypnosis. She has a great sense of humor and found her material enjoyable to read. This book is a must for anyone with an interest in Hypnosis!
1,dumb as hell,this book is dumb ass hell and if u got that much time to write a 400 page book about a chat room you dumb as hell to. that's why i rate this book a zero but the lowest is one but the author of this book must be real bored and need to get a life. i recommend nobody buy this dumb ass book.
3,Like WHOA!!,"Well, because I'm only about-a little over a third ways through this book and because page by page I have yet to say that I dont like lit-I'm gonna give it a 3 for midways thus far. Because I'm such a Janet fan, I'd LOVE to get this author a big fat 1. But as an aspiring writer myself and because I dont want to seem like I'm (whats the word?) ""player hating,"" I am going to have to be fair (for as far as I am in the book) and give it a midways 3, because so far, I am BLOWN AWAY each page and it could get nothing but better (each page) so I'm am noticing... Now, I will say this however, IF this IS a true story-man-shame on (Janet?) I giggle. But IF this author just conjured up this story-then hell, she's a genius but should be shamed of herself. So far though, from what i'm reading and can tell, shame on Janet. ( I love her though-I just didnt think she had it in her, its just giving me a newer side to her that I couldnt have ever imagined she'd have) But, she's still the greatest!"
3,Bought this in 2005,"At the time I bought this for a night vision car install because of the long distance night vision viewing, worked great at the time, but i am sure there are newer smaller better models available."
4,It does what it says it does.,"It works. Oh damn it, I have to supply ten more words before I can send off this recommendation. Goodbye."
1,Empty Bottle,"To my displeasure when I got the bottle it was brand new and empty. It must have been a manufacture thing, but I wasted my money. Be carefully buying this product."
4,Great and fun workout!,"I love Leslie's workouts! This dvd is fun and a feel good workout. Leslie can always put a smile on my face, while I'm getting a great workout! She does indeed do a lot of talking and joking around in this one, so just be prepared for that. :) I love the joking in this one, that she does with the guy, Jimmy. LOL! This is one of my favorite workouts from Leslie, that I've used. Totally recommend it!"
4,More intense than her other workouts,"I bought this as I was looking for something with a bit more intensity and this was it. Its fast paced and sometimes I have hard a time keeping up! I usually include it in my workout when I need a boost. I love the music only option as well. Music is 80's, BUT, its a perfect walking beat. This has become a staple in my workout."
3,Not Leslie's Best,"I am a ardent Leslie fan but I was disappointed by this video. The interval ""boosted walking"" was fun but the quality of the production was poor, and she talks so much that she seems to distract even herself from the workout, especially toward the end. And the part where she brings out the James Brown doll is just embarrassing! I'm hoping to find another ""boosted walking"" dvd by Leslie that is more professionally done and easier to follow. She often jumps from one move to another with practically no warning, which is not her usual style.Another con is that there is very little upper body workout in this dvd. Because of an old ankle injury I wasn't able to do the jogging ""moves"" but it felt great to just jog in place."
3,Probably the best of the family of films with this title,"The 1978 version of The Thief of Baghdad is probably the best of the family of films under this title. Unlike the Sabu (1940s) and Reeves (1960s) versions, this film takes a fairly serious attitude to the story. A made-for-television movie, this film has fairly good special effects for its era. The flying carpet and genie scenes convey the excitement of the quest to find the All-seeing Eye and rescue the Princess Jasmine from the evil Vizier. Roddy McDowell's rendition of the amiable thief/street magician, Hasan is pleasant relief without the slapstick found in earlier versions of the film. The test of the Temple of Truth and the final scene in which Prince Taj smashes the Vizier's soul (found hidden in a giant egg) is a combination of The Arabian Nights and European folklore. Great stuff! I enjoyed watching this film as much now as I did back in 1978."
4,Only had one complaint,"Used it to help build the deck on our house. Hasn't been used a whole lot. The saw has plenty of power and seems to be built very well. The only problem I had was the quick-lok blade holder wouldn't lock onto an after market saw blade very good. The blade would keep coming out of the clamp. But it only did this with a Fastenal brand wood blade, all the Milwaukee blades stayed in fine, even though they all appeared to be identical. Probably just the blade. One other thing is when I bought the saw it was advertised as having a disconnecting power cord but it does not. This was not an issue for me but might be for someone else. Overall very happy with the saw."
3,For Naschy Fans Only,"One of Naschy's lesser Werewolf films, this is a confusing mess, not helped by the terrible transfer - barely colour, pan and scanned and badly dubbed. But it's cheap, and there's so little Naschy available. So for Naschy fans only."
3,Everybody's Wolf Chow!...,"Paul Naschy is at it again! He's a wolfman in facial-fuzz, rubber fangs, and a big Elvis wig! He actually looks more like Wolfman Jack than a true lycanthrope. Anyway, this time around, he gets in a car wreck (arranged by his loving wife and her boyfriend) and supposedly dies. Luckily, the local M.D.(mad doctor) named Eva Wolfstein (!!) digs him out of his grave, takes him back to her secret lab, and revives him. You see, the good doctor wants a man like Naschy real bad! She wants both a love slave in human form, and a werewolf to cause mayhem during the full moon! I told you she was mad! FOTW is alright. It's schlocky to the core, but it's probably supposed to be. I especially like the drugged hippies in the castle dungeon! What was that all about?? An extra star for Dr. Wolfstein. She's a sadistic sort w/ an eeeevil twinkle in her eyes! My kind of woman! Rowwrrr!..."
1,To easy,I brought the game a friday night becuse i needed a new game to play i got antoher one and took this one back becuse after 2 hours i had beten it thare are 13 levels and half of them took about 5 minuits!I think the game was ment for little kids and also i didnt like the wepons and bad guys
1,Crap.,"Yet another Hendrix ""tribute"" that is more an of a insult. Buy a real Hendrix album before you buy this. If you are still even thinking about buying this album, hit yourself repeatedly with a baseball bat until you come to your senses."
4,"good compression, okay support, tight around front ankle bone.","The fabric is very high quality, stretches well and provides very good compression around the ankle. Much better material than other ankle sleeves I've tried, it seems very solidly made. Support is okay, but you shouldn't depend on an ankle sleeve for support. Inversion sprains are just as likely--you need a sturdy lace-up ankle brace to prevent those. This is for warmth and compression, similar to why bikers wear spandex tights. Support seems better than ankle sleeves with an open heel though, however, the top part of this ankle sleeve digs into the top of my ankle bone, where it creases when I dorsi-flex my ankle. So its uncomfortable when I run with it on. I don't know if it's because of the closed toe design, but i'll update if the crease discomfort goes away after continued use"
5,"If you like Alex, and ambient/new age stuff in general, this is worth the price.","I got to know Alexander Brandon's music when I suddenly realized that I liked the music for the game Unreal better than the game. So I added a little reverb, converted it to Mp3 and was hooked. I think he songs are really evocative...since I am a huge fan of ambient and soundscape music, I really like songs that create an environment and/or a story in your heard just by their sounds, no words. This CD will be that for you...favorite songs include ""Cascade"" -- very emotional, both sweet and mysterious song, and ""My Garden"" -- an excellent meditation song. Good for starting your dream engine before you go to bed at night."
2,4th leading cause ?,"I wondered about this statement describing this book, so I decided to do some reserch: ""As liver disease has skyrocketed to the fourth leading cause of death in the United States"".First off, from what I read, liver disease has actually fallen in the U.S. since 1960 (which makes sense, as we live healthier and drink less).Also, here are the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.: 1. heart disease (by far the biggest one, and totally dwarfs liver disease), 2. cancer, 3. ""cerebrovascular"", 4. Lung diseases, 5. Injuries from accidents, 6. diabetes, 7. Flu, 8. Alzheimers, 9. Nephrosis, 10. Septicemia.Nowhere is liver disease found in the top 10, and it is also not skyrocketing. In short, false alarm. Also note that there is some research showing that coffee is very protective of the liver. So if you are concerned about liver health (for example, from alcohol), just drink 3 to 4 cups of coffee a day (unless there is some medical reason for you not to, etc.)."
2,Nope.,"The music is pretty lame.The workout is hard on the knees.Make sure if you buy this you get a real copy or download it, because using amazon's video feature, I cannot see the step guide.Corny.I'm out of shape and I didn't really break a sweat. The only thing that hurt were my knees."
4,hip hop dance dvd,"This is a fun, high energy video. I am a bigger woman and found it pretty easy to follow and actually do the moves. Plus my daughter loved it also."
4,fun video,This is a fun video. It goes a little fast and I couldn't keep up with it at first. Was a great workout though and was a lot of fun! I would recommend it to friends
5,Great fun!,"This dvd is really fun. The dance move tutorial at the beginning is definatley a plus and although they take some practise to master, they are not too complicated. I feel this dvd gives me a great workout."
4,fun way to excersize,"I really enjoy dance workout videos because they are a fun way to get my heart pumping. I am a lazy person, so I need fun activities like dance to get my daily excersize.I enjoy this instructor because she is up beat but not too upbeat and relatively easy to follow... I do find myself getting the steps morer and more each time I do the video. It keeps the video interesting that I don't get the steps 100% the first time... I didn't use the step guide at all because I found it boring... I just went straight to the workout. I definitely reccomend this video to others."
2,Not Very Exciting,"I hate to put up negative reviews, I feel like a jerk and I don't mean to be but this workout was just dorky. It wasn't upbeat, it wasn't hip hop. She did the tootsy roll for goodness sake! I ended up selling it."
3,dance,This dvd is very fast paced. I had a hard time keeeping up which I guess is a reflection on me not the dvd. All i can say is good luck!:)
3,Dance off the Inches: Hip Hop Party,"The dvd ""Dance off the Inches: Hip Hop Party"" is OK. The best workout so far is by cindy crawford."
4,Jennifer Galardi,"This is a fun workout! I sweat lots working out with this dance routine and it is not boring. I am new to this kind of workout so I try to remember which routine comes with what! Just the same, I like the idea that exercise can be fun and not to be dreaded."
4,most enjoyable workout,"now i have a TON of workout videos and have rented a TON more but this one BY FAR knocked my socks off. it was SOOOOOO much fun, the most fun i have ever had while working out and i felt so good about myself, even when i was alone. i didnt watch the step guide but still picked up the faster moves. would have gotten more out of it if i knew what she was going to do but that is my fault for not doing the step guide first. i would have caught into her moves faster. HIGHLY recommend this workout, it was a blast and i had so much fun i got through the whole thing. recommended for beginners as you can stop early after the first few sections or even advanced as you can really put your whole body into it, its all up to how much you put yourself into it. good workout for all stages. i feel good and im looking better. GET THIS ONE!"
1,Not nearly as fun as I thought,I bought this DVD thinking I would learn some neat hip hop moves and get a work out at the same time. I was wrong! The moves are boring and repetitive. I don't work out that much and it barely made me sweat. Her attitude is good but that's about the only thing.
2,Too passive and repetitive,I think this product is for beginners. I love to do physical exercises and I was looking for hip hop videos with coreography to have fun while doing the exercise...but it has been boring for me. Is like to be warming up during almost all the routine.
1,Not what I thought,Wasn't what I thought at all ... pretty boring. I was hoping for something a little more modern.
2,Hip Hop Dance,"I personally don't really like it, mainly because I am new to hip hop and wanted to try it out, and just found out hip hop is not really my thing.But the teacher is actually really good, and the moves are fun and varied.I would not say it's beginner, more like intermediate. It's a decent workout too with warm up and cool down.Fine if you like hip hop and are beyond beginner's level."
5,"Great deal, great product.",This was a great deal and there were no problems regarding the reliability of the cartridges. This was everything I expected.
2,so-so,Works too good at keeping the factory tank full. The backflow valve doesn't work worth a crap... I have to shut off the tank to keep it from overflowing the truck tank.
5,"Who says ""over 40"" people won't like it?","Yeah, I guess this is a generation X novel, but I'm well beyond that and I still got one tremendous kick out of it.This is good free-wheeling satire, a good-natured poke at marketing and consumerism.It's a fast, easy read following our hero, Scat, who has a million dollar idea only for it to be stolen by his trusted room mate, Sneaky Pete. Falling in love with self-proclaimed lesbian, 6, Scat has her help as the two play the corporate games for their profit and our fun.I read Barry's second novel, JENNIFER GOVERNMENT, first and liked it so much, I went on and read this earlier novel. Call it silly and inane if you want and you might even be right, but it's still an enjoyable roller coaster ride."
4,Save Me from Marketing!,"This is a rather quirky novel fictiously set in the Coca Cola Company about the high-powered world of marketing. This author would certainly have us believe that they only things more hyped up than the product being sold, are the hyped-up marketing executives themselves. This is a funny, fast-paced book which was a pleasant change of pace from more traditional novels. As someone who has never been directly involved in marketing, I have no idea whether or not it bears any resemblance to reality, but I do tend to suspect that the idea that the average consumer is a fool, is no doubt spot on."
5,A Clever Send-Up of American Marketing,"Australian Max Barry has captured the absurdity of American corporate marketing in this humorous novel about Scat, a young man desperate to cash in one of his million dollar ideas. When his concept for an ultra-cool cola called Fukk leaves Scat homeless and penniless, the fun begins. Told in short punchy scenes reminiscent of 30-second television spots, this novel has a lively, page turning pace. If you enjoy cultural satire and fast-paced, tongue-in-cheek humor, this book is for you."
3,Not Machine Man,"Having first read Machine Man, and thoroughly enjoyed it, I chose to read Syrup after reading several favorable reviews. I found the premise of the book and the cynical view of Marketing and big corporations enjoyable. I also liked the naming of the Characters: Sneaky Pete, Skat, 6, @. How could a book with character names like that miss? But I found the climax of the book a little disappointing. After a huge buildup, the ultimate defeat of Sneaky Pete was a little too easy. And the characters didn't seem to have much depth. What was Sneaky Pete's back story? How did he get to be Sneaky Pete? Why was 6 so closed about feelings and relationships? We will never know. I did enjoy the book, just not quite as much as Machine Man, but I will be reading more Max Berry."
5,Great Buy,Excellent product. Arrived a head of schedule. Love it. Will suit my needs perfectly. Glad I found it. If you're looking for a simple portfolio give this one a try.
1,Sticky label and stains,"As noted by one the reviewers, the label is impossible to remove. At all! I ended up with two huge glue stains that wouldn't come of. Maybe it needs to be sanded, but I don't think it's worth the trouble."
1,Much worse then a Holiday Inn,This is not that great of a song and plus Chingy off all people has the best verse on the song over Snoop Dogg and Ludacris.Lyrics 2/10 Production 1/10 Overall 1.5/10At least Right Thurr was fun this is just crap pick up Doggystyle and album by Doggy Dogg in Snoops hayday man
4,enjoyed the series,Enjoyed the series. Read the first one for free then just had to order this one. The second one of course did not meet the expectations I had but enjoyed it anyway
3,Unforgotten,Slow and not holding attention as previous book. gets very boring in places. Not as fast moving. Will finish and look forward to third book in the series
2,"well, maybe not...","not much new info in this one. reads fast, but not too much information.LIBRARY loan would be best!"
1,Verizon sucks!,"Had no service at my house, so had to cancel service....and pay TONS of money for termination fees. Nice, right? Their service stinks so I have to pay extra money to cancel...sounds fair to me...NOT! Thanks Sprint for giving me a great deal after hearing how bad Verizon stinks!"
2,"Just so, so : /","This was portrayed as a coffee table book with high quality images. It is not. It is very small 5.5"" x 8"", and the images are so small that you cannot fully appreciate the artwork.Disappointing :("
2,large and sturdy but a design flaw,"This was a large and heavy chopping board that I had always wanted. But after 3 months of light usage, I've found a crack running through the side near the center area of the board. The board is made of strips of bamboo woods laid down and glued in an uniform alignment instead of staggering them(think of brick layering)."
5,Son Loved This,I bought this for my son for Christmas '07. He has a great love of classic Mustangs and was so pleased. He placed it on the tree before opening his remaining gifts.
3,I thought it would be bigger.,"To me, the picture makes it look like it'll be bigger than it is. It's tiny. Well, not tiny, the size of the average nail polish remover bottle. I can't find any pure acetone nail polish remover where I live, so I was hoping this would last me longer than a week. I'm all out now, so it's dissapointing. It works amazing, but if you're buying some, buy more than one bottle. Trust me, girls. Also, it is my fault haha. It says 4 oz. so I should have known. I'll buy more, like I said, it's really amazing. It doesn't look like the picture, either."
3,band is fantastic,"I own many, many Leslie DVD's and would not be surprised to discover that she walks on water (just kidding). This DVD is good to get you started with a band, but after a time or two, it gets very boring. BUT I love the band and use it every day. I just don't use the DVD anymore. Once you learn the exercises, it is much easier to simply work at your own pace and concentrate on the areas you are most interest in. For example, I spend about five full minutes on the leg scissor exercises for inner thighs - I do smaller one and larger ones for a different burn. This DVD will get you started but you probably won't use it for long. But you'll love the band that comes with the DVD."
4,Not much better than NFL Street 1.,"If you already have the first NFL Street, I see no reason to upgrade unless you like jumping off walls. It's still lacking on play selection (I think it's 99% the same as the 1st one). I was hoping for more smak talk, but it's EXACTLY the same. Same styles etc. Same graphics; pretty much the same exact game. I see no reason why to spend $50 more for this if you already have the 1st one.If you don't have the NFL strrt 1, pick this up, cuz it is a blast!"
4,defence?,"let me say ive spent at least 100 hours on nfl street one and maybe 15 hours on nfl street 2. 2 things that make this game very bad the defence sucks in this game, yes i know how to use the defence but it takes a long time to force tons of fumbles and interction are luck for the most part. The rosters are like 3 years old and you cant trade players to make your team somewhat updated. This game is good but if your going to play online you better step up your game, because it doesnt matter how good you are offline. They need to make a nfl 3 with updated rosters you can load off the online service."
1,Cheesy self-proclaimed poet.,"I found this book insufferable, and didn't get very far into it. His attempt at deep philosphy and poetry fell flat with me. Can't a wound simply bleed because the vein is open? Can't the surgery ever simply fix the problem, allowing the body to heal? Others, apparently, like this kind of stuff. If you don't, steer clear!"
4,worked fine,"what more can I say? I need 15 words so here they are one, two, three, four five, and six."
5,Octopus massager,"If you can find someone to use the octopus on your back you are in for a real treat. Everyone says it is a wonderful experience. It is almost magical how it relaxes every tense muscle. You can't believe how good you feel after a massage with this massager. I bought three of them. If world leaders had these used on them, I swear, there would be less war. You just can't imagine you can feel this good. But you can!"
2,Half-baked,"I've used it for more than a year now with Skype. I have 2 handsets.It was the first reasonably-priced phone of its type that I could afford. So I got it because there was nothing better...The phone software improved a few times, but the phone continues to have problems. Sometimes turns off every few minutes during the call. The volume always has to be turned up. The battery life is very short, especially with a handset.I use it as my primary home phone. So, it's never been as reliable for that as it should be. Don't invest in this half-baked product, if you can afford something better.When I have the money, I will buy the Philips voip841. I just bought one for my Mom. It doesn't need to be connected to the PC to work, and works much better."
5,Great book great seller thanks,I love this book it was very informative. As a therapist I use this book to help my clients it teaches valuable techniques to use in order to forgive and move on.
2,A SONIC ORGY,"This CD can only be described as ""a sonic orgy"" or ""a celebration of sound efects"". I'm very disappointed at this compilation. A good example of this cacaphony (as one reviewer puts it) is ""This land is your land"". I have to stop this piece after the first 90 seconds, the orgy then takes effect. The choir, on the other hand, deserves high marks for the songs it seems to have sung countless times, like ""Battle hymn of the republic"" or ""The Star-spangled banner"". But, as I have said before, the habit they have of adding orchestras and brass choirs is a distraction from the singing. In that way, they may be typically American, where bigger seems to be the equivalent of better. I still love the art they displayed in the LP 'A Mighty Fortress"". That is the choir at its very best."
5,Great Patriotic music,"Most of the traditional songs on this cd sound wonderful. While the miltiary themes (Cassons Go Rolling Along, Marine Hymn, etc.) are not the march type songs one has come to expect, they are sung beutifully and stir some strong emotions, particullarly with our troups currently over seas.Overall, theis is a great CD for Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Vetrans Day occasions,and just listening to on it's own. I highly recomend it."
2,"Great choir, lousy mastering","Naturally, I love the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for its mission, its beautiful sound and clarity. This CD should never have left the mastering room in its current state. I am extremely disappointed with the overwhelming presence of the orchestras (I wish the description of the CD would mention that the choir doesn't perform by itself), they take center stage in every song. This is easily avoided with proper sound editing. As a result, most words sung are barely audible, and the choir's eloquent performance techniques are lost in the cacaphony of notes. These are songs celebrating our great country, they should sound that way!"
3,Fine American goose-bump choral music,"God Bless America is a fine collection of American anthems and battle-cry songs, beautifully executed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. My only complaint is that, while the CD contains more tracks than the original vinyl of the same title, a couple of the better tracks have been left off. But combine this one with their 30 best songs, and you get the lot."
3,Could last longer....,"The product works perfectly for about and a half until the clips break on the back of the pusher that hold the pusher down and engage the safety mechanism. Then you have to buy a new pusher. I am now ordering my fourth replacement. Each one has lasted about 1.5 years. I am happy with its function, just not its durability."
1,Cuisinart Makes Cheap Products! BOOO!,My review is not for your service which is always great. My review is for this blade on a $150.00 food processer that broke after two years. Seems like it should last longer. Cuisinart has really gone downhill over the last 25 years. I had a food processer from them that lasted 19 years with no problems. This one is breaking up piece by piece and it is almost as expensive to replace the parts. I have been very disappointed in several of their products and will never purchase another Cuisinart product again and will tell my friends to do the same!
3,ok read,There were some charming parts. You can skip over the religious calling and abolition parts that go on and on. The main thing this book lacks is the conversation. Since this is a sequel I feel I must compare with Jane Austen. You came to know her characters through their conversations. You didn't need to be told who they were she showed you. It just wasn't the fun novel I was hoping for. For a fuller review I would recommend Marcy Gomez.
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm a little perplexed by the Visual Quickstart series. They can always be counted on to take a mediocre manual, repackage it and sell it back to you. They have done so again with this book. If you have read the manual you'll realize this book is very similar. I'd suggest saving your money and purchasing Dreamweaver 3 HOT (Hands on Training) by Lynda Weinman and Garo Green. It's the best ""training"" book I've found to date."
2,Not as cute as I thought it would be,"The cover is very cute, and the title is so cute I thought the book would be pretty funny. But, it sort of let me down, it is just basic things that all babies do such as drink milk but in the book it says 'urban babies drink latte' with a picture of a baby drinking their bottle. It is cute enough if you are looking for some board books for you children to be able to flip through on their own, but I wouldn't recommend as a gift (which is why I purchased it)."
2,Don't bother reading this book,"Like others, I found the cover illustration, blurb, and even the title misleading. This book has very little to do with the main character, Poppy, as a teenager, or about her looking for a husband. Rather, this novel follows Poppy as she grows up and lives a self-centered and un-productive life. I didn't find anything to like about her character -- she was ignorant, boastful, and lazy. And, most unfortate of all, the historical details which could have redeemed this book since it takes place over such an interesting span of time were either lacking or inaccurate."
4,Romance?,I would like to know where people got the idea that this book is a romance. It is in the general fiction area of any book store I've been to.The book is a good read and I would recommend it to anyone look for an easy read.
5,MAKES YOU BELIEVE IN MAGICK,"I JUST FINISHED READING THIS BOOK FOR THE 5TH TIME! IT REALLY MAKES YOU BELIEVE IN MAGICK OF ANY KIND. THE MAIN CHARACTER IZZY IS EASY TO RELATE WITH AND SHE'LL REMIND YOU OF SOME-ONE YOU KNOW! DE LINT HAS A WONDERFUL WAY OF TOUCHING ON SUBJECT WE ALL DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT,BUT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF. YOU'LL NEVER LOOK AT A PAINTING THE SAME WAY AGAIN!"
2,Three leaked after two uses,"Eh. Not too thrilled with these. Half of them were leaking after two uses. I live at 7,300 feet, so these may be leaking because of the altitude.Another thing I don't like about these is that the two largest sizes - the .45mm and the .5mm aren't any smaller than a regular wet-tipped pen. The finer pointed pens, .35mm and under, are the only ones I use.Would not buy these again."
5,Good quality cheap drawing tools,"I bought one Sakura micron a year ago at my local bookstore as they were recommended for underlining books, and I was surprised at the quality they were! Of course, I had to buy this set on Amazon and am very satisfied with the results. The set has different sizes allowing you to sample each size and see how they work. I use it mainly for drawing and like using the 005 for details. I like how quickly it dries because of the odd way I write. I tend to put a lot of pressure and my hand is on the paper half the time. It has decreased the amount of black marks on my hand by a lot, and has removed my fear from writing notes with pen without turning into a lot of smudges. The black set is also strong enough in appearance to ""pop-up"" in anything I use it on. When I receive compliments about my work having this printer appearance, I give credit to this pen. I could probably get much nicer pens, but with my budget now, Sakura microns are for me!"
4,A grand inking pen with many sizes to please.,"These were the very first inking pens I ever got, and I was shocked by how well they worked.First off, they come in a variety of sizes, from the fairly thick .05 to the deliciously thin .005. It offers a nice range of line widths for artwork and a must-have for comic art. (And be sure to get the Brush Pen, the pen that acts like a mini-paintbrush!)The peeve I have about Sakura Micron is that the tip of the .005 is a bit fragile and liable to bend, but considering how tiny it is, you sort of expect that.Overall, a good pen whose sizes and alternate colors really make them stand out, but you have to be careful with the points, especially .005."
4,Great product,I always use Staedler for my zentangle. Someone recommended the Sakura pen. It was a great experience. I used it on different kind of paper and it absorb it very well. Still I do not like to use it on surface such as domino cause it I have to pass the pen several times and it takes for ever to dry. but besides that the pen are fabulous!
5,Finally!,"I am so happy that the Original Broadway Cast Recording of ""My Fair Lady"" has finally been remastered! I've always prefered the ""White Version"" over the ""Gold Version"" for the freshness of the performances. My only minor quibble: Why wasn't ""The Embassy Waltz"" included in this recording? The version used in the remasted London cast recording was originally recorded for the Broadway cast album in 1956, but was cut from the recording due to the limited amount of space on long-playing records at the time. I'm surprised that Sony didn't include it in this version as well. Even still, this remaster of the 1956 original is a MUST-HAVE and it is a shame that Sony/Columbia didn't release it earlier."
3,"Good, but not for the Family","I initially really enjoyed the movie my fair lady and wanted a sound track so I could continue to enjoy the music. However, upon recieving the cd, I was especially disappointed with one aspect - the language. I knew Professor Higgins and others had used profanity on the film, and was ok with it. You hear it once and move on. However, I don't want a cd playing around my family that my kids are learning to dance, sing, and act out a song that has rather obvious swear words. After 1 listen I picked out at least three instances of swearing, the worst being I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face (my otherwise favorite song!) The song starts out d--n, d--n, d--n! It's shouted."
1,NO FFB FOR PC!,"Yes, its a really nice wheel very good response and all that good stuff, BUT what they didnt tell you is that the Force Feed Back is ONLY for PS2 not for PC. Choose your Wheels wisely"
1,fake picture from J&R on racing wheel,"I Thought i was getting the wheel depicted on the site as the Thrustmaster Enzo Ferrari Dual PC/PS2 Racing Wheel. I thought the shifter was a good deal for the money. But i got a totally different wheel that sucks. no shifter like in the picture, just some crappy paddles. and let me tell you the force feedback is a lie. on pc there is no feedback what so ever, even with the lastest drivers installed. and for playstation 2 there is no feedback, its more like a rumble than feedback. i wouldnt suggest this wheel to anyone. unless you like wasting more.overall this wheel really sucks."
2,Pure Evil,"First off, the game's graphics and controls are great, even fun to go through x amount of levels before it turns into something totally crude, offensive, and evil.I had the displeasure of going into the level ""We don't go to Ravenclaw"" or whatever it's called, and you're basically in an abandoned town at night with mentally handicapped people screaming at you ""Let go of me!!"" while you throw saw blades at everyone.If you're getting sick and tired of the evil crap put out there in the media, don't trot in this excrement. Bad, bad, bad. They couldn't have made that level any worse than it is, and I probably even had a psychosis as a result of playing enough of it!"
3,wait for the xbox360 version,"i never played the pc version but i imagine it is a smoothly running version of this game. if thats the case then it must be incredible. this game however has a choppy framerate too much of the time. for a guy like me who has been playing games like halo and call of duty it was too much for me, i ended up quiting before i got to the end. the story seemed awesome and the visuals were sweet but neither is good enough to put up with the absolutely lousy framerate issues"
3,Good but short,"Really enjoyed this game, good graphics and story line. Wish it was a little longer and that you could play more than one player. Middle levels challegeing but end level to easy."
5,Half Life 2 for XBox /XBox 360,"The game play is the best, the storyline. The graphics are good also. The puzzles that are presented are challenging."
4,Wonderful.,"Andy Runton, Owly: Just a Little Blue (Top Shelf, 2005)Owly and Wormy find themselves besieged by a pair of blue jays. In order to mollify them, Owly builds a nesting box, but they reject it in favor of the dead hollow tree they've been nesting in. All is well, if uneasy, until a big storm hits the valley, destroying the tree and causing one of the jays' babies to go missing. Once again, Andy Runton has done a fantastic job of conveying a world of feeling in very simple drawings; Owly is a great series for all ages and, as Runton says on his website, for people who think they don't like comics. If you haven't discovered Owly yet, it's definitely worth searching out. ****"
1,"Sad, but true","I installed these, after they arrived in record time ( a minor plus ) and on the first day after I decided to go for a drive and attempted to use the handle to stabilize my entry into the Jeep. I have recently undergone shoulder surgery so the added assistance was going to be a big plus. Unfortunately, to my great surprise, the handle BROKE! Yes,the stitching came completely undone and the handle came off in my hand. I did not even apply 1/4 of my body weight onto the strap, I only used it as I was seated and attempting to position myself properly in the seat. I never had this problem with the other straps that were previously installed. Very disappointed!!"
3,Grab Handle,They work for the most part but they just look nice more than anything and they were cheap so it was a win!
5,"""Oh S**T!"" handles by rampage","These are awesome, cheap, and easy to install. They look rugged and like they belong in a jeep. I've got a couple comments on them by passengers. I use them daily, and they support weight well."
3,Rampage 769301,Look like a beach floating device. Not esthetic. Look very cheap. I recommend instead the (Rugged Ridge 13505.04) and the (Rugged Ridge 13305.14) Really don't like it. I rates 3star because have a great construction and work well.
5,AWESOME!,"This was the most entertaining and shockingly funny books I have every read. It is so outlandish that it is hard to believe, yet it kept me in stitches laughing out loud. I highly recommend this book."
4,Very Helpful,"This book was very helpful. It's a great reference to have at home. It has everything from colds, flu and sinusitis to arthritis, etc. If you are looking for a specific topic to go in depth, you will need a supplemental book. I found it to be even more helpful when I read it the 2nd time around."
2,"Recipes for Health:Dibetes:Low Fat, Low Sugar, Carbohydrate","The book's recipes are like what you would find in England, not in the States. Also the carb counts are very high for the main meals. For example ""Fish Stuffed Baked Potatoes"" has 230 carbs and 1170 calories? Too much for me and I have never heard of this. I did not like the book at all and will be getting rid of it shortly."
4,"Good, only 1 drawback","Fits great, and probably shields from ""drop damage"". Somewhat interferes with the standard Apple dock. However, one can easily use an adapter cable to connect to your computer's USB."
5,Fantastic Book,"I have a couple webdesign-related books here at work, and this is the only one I come back to from time to time. It's very well designed and laid out, has plenty of illustrations and humorous cartoons, and just like the title says, you can breeze through this thing and soak it up without really even trying.This book isn't a nuts-n-bolts kind of thing, with code illustrations or or tooltips or any of that low-level stuff. No CSS, HTML, scripting, architecture tips are in this book."
3,What's up with the binding?,"A nicely crafted book-like this one-that falls apart with no overuse is like a nice piece of clothing that won't stand the first wash. And we are not taking about cheap clothing here. But anyway, let's focus on what matters most: the content. I was expecting more from the book, but overall I don't feel disappointed. I wouldn't call the book simplistic because it heavily relies on common sense. After all, you don't have to go very far on the web to find sites where common sense seems to be the least used of all senses. The chapter on usability testing was particularly useful to me. And although nothing in the book was particularly striking or illuminating, I felt it made a positive contribution to my knowledge on the subject."
4,"Concise, practical and easy to read","At last -- a usability book with a friendly voice!Good looking, well edited, well proofread, short and to the point: a clearly-written summary of how to make Web sites easier to use.I'd give it five stars but for the fact that there's nothing really new or radical here, and it's expensive for a 195-page book.More please, Steve Krug!"
2,Not for those with experience,"While this book might be good for web design newbies, it's definitely not for those with any experience. It does do a good job of covering the basics of web page design, which is useful for new designers. Experienced designers will be disappointed, however, because that's where it ends"
3,Not for international users!,"The value of this book is that it's simple and direct. If you are a beginner in usability and usability testing, buy this one first. However, if live outside the US and you're not familiar to expressions like ""Off the bat"" or ""Everybody wants to drop a line in the home page"", maybe you'll have problems. Perhaps the writer should travel a little bit more and see different cultures with people speaking different languages. And then write books people who speak english as second language understand, specially those on usability ..."
5,"You're a pro, now act like one!","If you're thinking of purchasing this book, your likely a seasoned veteran in web design. However, it is also likely that you're going to learn some new tricks and make the world (wide-web) a better place in the meantime. I highly recommend this book because you're not as good as you think you are.I read this book in a few days, cover-to-cover. It's a quick read because it's not full o' fluff. Save the rest of us and read this, quick!"
5,A must read for anyone involved in website creation,"An infinitely quotable book which takes you through the fundaments of designing websites that customers will find easy to use. Easy to use websites of course being successful websites.If nothing else, this book arms the believer with succinctly put arguments to put to the next avid ""intro flash page"" or ""let's make our website different"" fan... Krug even provides copy/paste emails to send to higher ups showing how sensible focusing on usability is.With its how tos, practical examples and explanations this book is a must read for anyone involved in website creation."
5,One of the Best Reads in its Class,"This book invites you to read it cover-to-cover. The information is presented so well, even a seasoned veteran will learn new tricks. I seek books these days with far fewer pages than the typical ""Bible"" or ""Unleashed"" series books. I demand well-presented, well thought-out content and this book delivers. The author(s) also chose to include enough comedy in their material to make the book purely enjoyable."
5,Simple & worth to collect!,"I'll make it simple, like this book's title :)1. GREAT BOOK! Worth to collect if you're someone involved in web design2. Easy to read, both the language & the lay out3. Good for professionals both amateursSo? What're you waiting for?"
2,Agreed; light on substance,"i agree with a previous review that said the book was light on substance. it seems more of a statement of the way things are rather than *why* things are. and the last part of the book is all about do-it-yourself useability testing. as a designer, this had little relevance for me. i honestly don't know who i would recommend this book to."
5,"Some Straight vocabulary, Some Conversation","Having started learning German in 7th grade, I had some high hopes for this book (ended formal study with Middle Ages German in college)...I find immersion the best method for learning (living or spending significnat time in a country)...but a book like this is the next best thing. I would recommend it highly for someone with one to two years of academic study (from scratch) already under their belt. It will prepare you for the inevitable immersion experience (for example, household vocabulary), you can spend 15-20 minutes a day and work through the book rather quickly and profit from the time spent commensurately.Much better than rote memorization, it provides context--which you'll have to have for that immersion experience. That's what I lacked when I went to Germany to study in 11th grade--I was speechless in everyday conversation. This book will help you with that transition."
4,Good if you're going on Yangtze River cruise,"We watched it BEFORE we went and found it right on. Got the heart beating faster just in anticipation. And reality was very much the same... Good if you plan, or already did, a cruise on the Yangtze."
4,I like the nut cracker just fear it.,I choose a 4 rating ! . I really like the product. When you push the hanlde to crack the nuts you cannot cover with the hand. This pinches your hand.. Without covering the nut the shell fly every where.
1,The base is too small.,Does not look this nice and it is very awkward to use. Cheap metal plus small base = immediate return of product. You are better off with a handheld sheller.
4,Easy to use but a little messy,"Of course, I never thought that cracking walnuts would be the cleanest activity. Good cracker that leaves whole walnuts intact."
5,This saved me!!,"The first few weeks of nursing are tough... my doctor recommended this, but said many lactation consultants won't suggest it. It took the edge off of nursing and my daughter did not have any issues transitioning back to nursing without it. I used it for about a week and was able to ""heal"" enough to handle nursing without. Was SO helpful in the first few days of nursing when it was so painful! I recommend these to all my pregnant friends and tell them to have it on hand just incase!"
5,very useful,"Helps with nursing 100%. My wife used it every day, until she got the hang of nursing. I highly recommend this product to anyone."
5,Great Seller!,"Due to my mistake misreading the discription, I purchased the wrong type of lens. When I discovered this, no problems at all returning it. Many, many thanks for the refund & forgiveness!"
2,READ the product description!,"I didn't read the product description and was disappointed when I received not the first DVD with 6 episodes plus extras, but a mini DVD with the first episode only. This first episode doesn't have the opening music and animation of the rest of the series - one of the things that I personally most wanted. I blame myself for being a lazy consumer - don't YOU be one!"
3,Ehhh..,"i wasnt that impressed---i admit, although the sex scenes are pretty explicit, the rest of the book went on forever- i agree with the first guy: home sounds like he wants to be a critic, because the humor of Alan's character got old really quick. home is over-indulgant and doesnt know how to keep things moderate (over does the sex, over does the book criticism, over does a lot of things); i think he tries too hard to make Anna apathetic and modern.however, if you take a million steps back and look at the story itself, its interesting--i just think home could have gone a better route of writing it."
2,Mediocre Minus,"Home has tried too hard to be all things in this novel, but finally comes across as juvenile, bleak and obviously trying to hit too many genres on Google.The porn is 14 year old stuff and curiously unstimulating, the literary critique is spiteful and prissy.I assume it's all a deliberate spoof, but it fails through lack of humour or any poetry.I've given it an extra star for the writing mechanics."
3,Bamboo garden stakes,"These stakes are dyed green and are 5 feet tall. I had problems pounding into the ground...it was very tall, but only 1/2 inch thick. I bought a package of 6 from a hardware store, this may be 6 or 25/ package...the seller does not specify. The 1"" thick stakes are very expensive, but I need those to stake my trees. These will work for smaller things, not 8' trees."
2,Good but the Disc Traction Belt is better,"I bought this and was not too happy with the effect.* First of all it DOES stretch your knees and ankles. How could it not? I don't need traction in my knees or ankles. Besides it is not too comfortable gripping around my ankles.* Second, I need to decompress while lying on my stomach so I have a natural arch in my lumbar spine. The Lynx does not allow my to do this. If I decompress on my back, and especially with my lumbar spine flat (not arched) I tear my discs apart.So for $70.00 LESS, I bought the Disc-Traction belt. It weight a couple ounces and folds up into the size of my hand. I can decompress in any position, it is comfortable, and does not pull on my ankles or knees."
3,P3 No substitute for the inversion table,I was looking for a portalble substitue for my Teeter Hang Ups inversion table but this did not fill that bill. It uses no leverage other than arm strength to streatch the back muscles. Maybe a younger person could benefit but at approaching 70 years I don't have the arm strength. Looking for something with a mechanical leverage. I returned the item and received a prompt refund.
4,"Addicting Passion, couldn't stop turning the pages!",The Game by Brenda Joyce was by far one of her best books. If you enjoyed the other ones they are far from comparable. The only ones that I would say compare are Promise of the Rose and the Conquerer. But I would still say The Game is amazing and I recommend it to all woman out there who love romance novels and aren't sure which ones to buy by who...this is the one!
4,Wonderful improvisations,"A highly recommended album, those who enjoyed his previous work on Brazilian music will find this album even more interesting and entertaining, enjoy!"
4,stunning acoustic rock and suavasous sights and sounds,"Son of Roy Harper, Nick pulls the plugs on the acoustic side of his style. With a powerful voice yet, sometimes delicate playing, these range of songs will suite your taste whatever the mood. Well crafted and atmospheric, as well as offering commentary on various aspects of life he's tasted. He gets better on each album and this will put you well into that folky-rock-classical-blues (whatever(who should classify anyway?)) verve whether you're coming home from the pub at 1 a.m. or driving to work at 8 a.m. Enjoy"
3,"Great Book, only if you're a Final Cut Pro user.","The first half of the book is very thorough in going over the basics of film and digital video. There's also some description on some basic equipment you'll need to get off the ground.The second half talks about basic editing in Final Cut, which I mostly skipped since I don't plan on using Final Cut. Honestly, for filmmakers who plan on using Final Cut, this would've probably made 5 stars.Have fun and good luck on your film!"
1,This book is rubbish,After reading all the reviews on amazon I decided to buy this book as a book I would use to transition from VB6 to C#. This book sounded perfectly pitched for this. With excellent reviews I decided to buy this book.I have now decided that the reviews on amazon are rigged. Either the publisher or author is paying people to write excellent reviews. There is no way this is due to the value of this book.
1,Awful,"These are absolutely awful. The seams on one of them came apart after about a day and they aren't any good to, you know, juggle. You are better off buying a few lemons. They last longer, smell better, are cheaper, are better to juggle, and you can eat them."
2,Some interesting info but dull,"The good point of this book (and the only one) was that it showed how difficult life was in the olden days (1910 to be exact), defting conservative notions of a golden age better than Stephanie Coontz has done. The bad points are that the language is dated (""Slav"" is considered a race, as is ""Colored"") and the book is rather boring. Not much duller than most sociohistorical works but not as informative either. Slightly recommended."
1,THIS BOOK IS A JOKE!,"After viewing the few pages available on the Amazon webpage for this book, I must say it is a joke. It is by no means a scholarly work as the back cover claims. How do I know? Within the two pages I read online I found several blatant errors, one of which will suffice to convince anyone of the weakness of scholarship in this book.The author, in speaking of the papal tiara (the triple crown of the pope)calls it a mitre! The mitre is the pointed hat worn by prelates that resembles the hat worn by the pater in the Cult of Mithra, and is totally different than a tiara.It is clear the author wrote this book hurriedly for quick profit. Sadly, non-Catholics won't catch many of her mistakes.Soo Suk Kok"
3,a tough read,"If you love the southwest, you might give this a read. But be warned it's difficult to get through."
3,Fun but Nothing New,"This book was colorful and nicely designed. It is not a practical, DYI-type book, but it's ok if you're a fan of the retro kitschy look. It doesn't take itself seriously, which is good because it can be silly, almost clown like. I didn't learn anything new, but it's fun to look at-makes me think of pee wee's playhouse!"
2,A Little Light,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. The designer's style seems very one note-I have to agree it's kind of a rero rehash-that looks dated to me. I think it's a fun book for the generation x folks who might think this sort of thing looks fresh and new. To someone a bit older, who has seen this stuff in it's original form, it just looks like a 60's stage set."
3,"Nice looking, but cheap","These valve caps are very nice looking, but they are made out of cheap plastic... I was expecting metal. The chrome is good quality, and the logo appears durable, but don't screw them on too tightly - they might break!"
3,A little less than i expected.,It is small and lacking in any real storyline but full of cool images and symbols. Maybe not worth the shipping but a must have if you love Emily the Strange.
3,"Not really much to do with Matchpoints, just how to get extra tricks","Playing a hand in Match Points can be very different than in IMPS. First you need to look at the bidding and see if you are in the field contract, or a good/bad contract. Secondly, you need to estimate if you got a favorable, neutral, or unfavorable lead. You also need to figure out what the risks are in the quest for over tricks.Example: AKQxx vs xxx, at MPs play for a 3-2 split, at IMPs duck once to cater to the 4-1 break.The problem with this book is there is little of this. Its more about how to get an over trick in general. The problems are ok, but they could be IMP problems as well.I'm not saying the book is bad. But I didn't think the problems were especially good (they don't have to be super hard like Kelseys) nor were they ""Matchpoint"" decision hands.The book is ok, nothing special, nothing bad."
2,Cheap junk,"It's very hard to get the Memory Stick out of this device. There's no push spring mechanism, and there's hardly any of the MS sticking out for you to grab it. Really cheap.After I bought it I realized that it doesn't accept Memory Stick Duo. My mistake for not being more attentive. Sony's new PSP takes Memory Stick Duo, so don't buy this if you own or plan to own a PSP."
1,Be careful with Sony MS Pro,It does take Sony MS Pro. But you will have a hard time to get it out. !!!
1,pretentious,"The style this book is written in is pretentious blabber mimicking as art - I read a book a week and so consider myself well-read and literate but this is too much. A few pages is ok if written this way, a whole book? more than I want to bother with, there are better things to do than wonder where the quotation marks are supposed to be."
3,Very cute but not comfy,"This set is adorable and my stepson loves it! But these are definitely the worst feeling sheets I have ever encountered. But my stepson doesn't care at all... so if you are considering these for a child, go ahead. They don't seem to care about the feel anyway!I am considering buying the same set in the full size, however, and I might just buy blue sheets with the comforter this time."
1,scratchy sand paper sheets,"These sheets are horrible. My son is 7 and refuses to sleep on them. They are stiff, thin, and tore from stretching them over the corners of the mattress."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,"Being pregnant with my second child after 11 years, I am starting all over again. I have read plenty of books to help me overcome my fears and anxieties. This book was AMAZING, it took me through every fear and anxiety that I was facing. It also gave me much insite as to what to expect and look forward to, my fears have diminished and I am looking forward to my delivery. To me, all the other books couldn't compare to this one. The graphic illustrations and exceptionally informative information this book provides is a must read for any expectant mother. I recommend it 100%. I hate that I had to find it and read it so late in my pregnancy."
1,Not worth it...,"I bought this book based on several good reviews, however, I was not impressed when I received the book. The book isn't really in any sort of format, so I had to do a lot of jumping around to find information. Once I found the information I was looking for, there would only be maybe a paragraph or two on the subject. I ended up going to the library and checking out ""You & Your Baby Pregnancy"" by Dr. Laura Riley. This book has been the best I've seen yet. If you are looking for a comprehensive, month by month or week by week book about your pregnancy, don't waste your money on The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth, you'll be disappointed."
3,Good book,"If this is your first pregnancy, you will find this information very helpful. However, this is my second pregnancy. I thought I would try a different book this time. While it's good info, I already knew most of this."
3,the unrevised version is better,"I agree with Aimee book lover, AP parent. I too did not like the updates. They are so concerned with being pc that they took away from the good feeling you got from reading the older version. I had borrowed the old version for my previous pregnancies and I loved it. It was about natural birth and home births and water births and left the reader feeling uplifted. I bought the new one for my last pregnancy and was really disappointed. It is so pc that that is all you think about as you are reading it. Save yourself some money and buy the older version from the used books on Amazon."
3,"Looks like Hunter D, but not as interesting","I got this because I thought the team who brought up Vampire Hunter D would knock the highlander story out of the park. They sort of took it to a new place, but this DVD is not as great as Hunter D: Bloodlust, which is one of my all time favorite anime. I gather, like me, it will be enough to get you curious. Take the ride by all means, just prepare NOT to get blown away like Bloodlust did."
1,"Write your biography instead, Valerie","This audio cassette is a huge disappointment. Not only is the content unamusing, but Valerie reads the lines s-l-o-w-l-y ... perhaps to try to fill 90 minutes (yes - the whole thing, unabridged, fits on one 90 minute tape!) How many pages were in the book version I wonder ... 6? It is hard to fathom what Valerie is trying to achieve with this mis-mash of supposedly woman-empowering babble, but she has failed dismally - she isn't even funny or interesting when quoting the odd line from Rhoda. Valerie, if you read this - PLEASE sit down and write your autobiography. I am sure all your fans would much rather hear about your rise to TV superstardom than hear tired old rants along the lines of ""wouldn't it be different if men got menopause"", etc."
2,Functional,"The wallet is really nice, but has a few tweaks that make it annoying, and the straps are somewhat loose"
4,QUALITY LEATHER BIBLE,"I was looking for a high quality, easy to use and carry, NIV bible and this thing fits the bill. The only problem is that, when it arrived, the text was slightly skewed on all pages, and this is an unacceptable defect for a $150 bible- so I sent it back. I was sincerely impressed w/ the rest of the bible though. The gen. morrocco cover w/ leather lining is the finest I have ever seen BAR NONE and the paper was in the same category. The font is the perfect size easily readable yet it's not GIANT. Holman & Broadman have done an excellent job in condensing this bible down to the practical essentials and building a ""user friendly"" bible. There is a more than ample reference section throughout, a concordance and high quality maps. This is a bible that will be your ""go to"" bible while the bulky study bibles sit on the shelf and they have built this thing to stand up to a lifetime of use. Now - if I could just get one w/o defects..."
2,Very Thin Plastic,These trays are made of a very thin plastic that is similar to the kind used for packaging. I was expecting something thick and durable like the trays that you can get in office supply stores. These are very flimsy and could be easily pierced with a letter opener or even cut with scissors.
3,OK after modification,"First of all - knock out the cheap piece of glass masquerading as a lens and use a proper macro. With a couple of rings between my EF-S 60 and the device I get a full frame shot of the slide. Also, if you need a cropped view and want to leave out the barrel with the lens (which has no lens anymore in my case...) you will have to grind down the threadless piece of plastic if you want to mount it directly on the 60, or else the threads cannot reach..Horrible out of the box - OK fast alternative to scanning after butchering - and RAW is an asset..It is a good idea to work with your camera tethered, shooting in live view for easier line-up of the slides. The slide adapter itself is not exactly a piece of precision work ;-)"
1,Slide copier or door stop?,"I recently purchased this Opteka HD Slide Copier for Canon EOS Digital SLR Cameras. I bought it to copy the hundreds of 35mm slides I have. Unfortunately, this copier has a square opening in its slide holder, and the rectangular image of a 35mm slide is partially covered on the ends (or top and bottom). It cannot be used to properly copy a single one of my slides. An email to Opteka seeking a solution to this problem has gone unanswered.If you are looking for a doorstop, you can do better.If you are looking for a slide copier, you can't do worse."
4,Praises for the Jolly Pocket Postman.,The Jolly Pocket Postman is a book that most people can enjoy. It takes pieces of childre's fairy tales and combines them to form an adventure for the postman. The book is written in rhymes which makes the book fun to read and listen to.the book uses olorful illustrations with relaxing tones. the pictures appear humorous with random objects incorparated in them. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it to everyone with young children.
2,Jolly Pocket book,The book was in good shape but a key component ( a little magnifying glass) was missing. They refer to it in the book to look for things but----. I could not use it!
3,Defective Cartridge,"The cartridge I received was defective - everything printed with it had a green hue. I contacted the seller - 4inkjets - and was told I had to deal with the manufacturer. I expect the seller to stand behind the product it sells, and not push me off to someone else. I called the manufacturer, and after spending time of the phone with them, they agreed to send a replacement cartridge."
3,"work with sony dvd player, not with my 2 others dvd player","I bought drx710ul 3/5/05 at Costco, because i have a laptop without dvd burner.I burned my first dvds on phillips 2.4x dvd diskI can play them on my laptop and my sony dvd player, but I can not play them from my 2 other dvd playersYet the dvd commercial movies I have can be played on all 3 of my dvd playersI am glad I don't have to buy sony dvd disks, and then burn my home videos on them.Sony has to be able to do better than thisThis dvd burner is still not up to my expectationmaybe try drx720ul-next model up"
1,piece of crap,"My husband and I spent way too long trying to get this stupid door to work. It appears that it is defective. The door swings out no problem, but does not swing back in. The little red tab that is supposed to respond to the magnet simply does not work. Don't waste your money or time on this product!"
2,Too easy for cats to escape!,"I don't consider my cats the smartest ones out there by any means, but by the end of the first day, they not only figured out how to climb through this door, but how to paw at the lock long enough to wiggle it and move the door to the open position. Even putting items in front of the door doesn't keep them in anymore. If you're needing to use the lock on this door, don't bother. It doesn't take much for them to get through on their own, whether or not the door is locked."
3,Technically Flawed,"This is the second Charley Sloan novel I've read, and I like it a lot, but the technical flaws are frustrating. I don't know what is involved in transforming a novel into ebook format, but this one, unlike any other I've purchased, is full of typing errors, like the hardback was scanned and then converted into text using one of those software programs that's only 95% accurate. It definitely detracts from the enjoyment. The story itself is 5 stars."
4,Not bad,"I would definately recommend this over the cheaper plastic models out there, but I would also caution that it is not for the weak-armed. It takes a lot of muscle to use this french fry cutter, and I always have to make my husband do it. Overall, though, is tough enough to do the job, as long as you are too!"
4,fry cutter not bad,I bought this and just used it it. Makes your cutting easier. The potato does not go all the way and I had to push through but overall I think this is a good buy. I have had hand held fry cutters and had the same prob with the potato going all the way through so overall not bad for the price. I like the look of it also goes well in my gadget kitchen :-).
1,Great if you like lukewarm coffee,The design is seriously flawed --- your coffee is lukewarm and it is impossible to pour from the decanters --- we had our unit for less than a month before the entire system failed - when you call the manufacturer they suggest you work through Amazon.com for a replacement -though the return policy at Amazon is limited to 30 days from shipment --- DON'T buy this if you want hot coffee or a quality product.
4,Better than other reviews,"I purchased this coffee maker before I read the reviews and then was concerned after I'd read them. The product works as described in the manual. Yes, you have to be careful that the carafes are properly in place and, like any thermos, it must be tipped to get the last of the coffee out. However, it does not deserve the negative reviews it is getting."
2,Too dry...,"I found the characters to be very dry and mechanical, I did not come to like them. the hero is selfish and even though he was the one who left a dozen years ago, he manages to blame her for keeping his son a secret, well excuse me but you leave, you have no rights. I was looking forward to this book, but too predictable."
3,Better than expected.,"I bought this VHS tape just to see the hard to find character actress, Kathleen Wilhoite. She was excellent in her three scenes (better than the leads), but the movie was surprisingly good itself. It's worth buying if you can find it cheap."
5,Taste Great - keeps better than boxed,I love these - easy to handle - easy to take on trips. They keep better int he small packages instead of buying the larger box unless you eat them up quickly...we aren't huge cracker eaters so these work great for us.They are easy to dip too!
1,Rock hard will break your teeth do not buy,These are rock hard do not buy they will break your teeth. There seems to be no way to return for exchange.
5,Great Thinking Processes book !!!,Helped me a lot in the understanding and using the TOC Thinking Processes. I strongly recommend it to ones searching the light at the root of the tree...
3,A Disturbing Read,Cerebral Cyanide to me is a disturbing read. This is not the kind of book that you can read and forget...it challenges you to think and explore with it. In a way I associate Cerebral Cyanide with a Trainspotting. The only drawback I found was that it lacked punch and was too 'inward' looking and therefore lacking universal appeal. Nevertheless I would recommend it to anyone who wants to think and explore through books rather than just read them!
5,I love this camera!!,"Canon has won my loyalty. I own an old Canon Elph, and now a Digital Elph, and I will never buy any other brand but Canon when it comes to cameras. The SD700 IS is sleek, stylish, and takes crystal clear pictures. I would recommend it to everyone I know!!"
4,Nice update to the Powershot A510,"I was looking for a less bulky camera and I researched many different brands and still ended up with a Canon. I still have to learn to fully use the features on this camera, but so far, so good. Sometimes the pictures come out a little dark, but it's probably b/c I have the wrong settings. Otherwise seems good for my purposes and is very compact."
3,what happened to the video sound quality?,"I bought this camera to replace my SD200, which I love, but it's falling apart. The SD700 is a great camera, and I love the larger screen and image stabilization. The added weight will probably be good to reduce camera shake. But the sound quality when taking movies is noticeably worse. I compared the two cameras side by side and played back the two videos; the SD200 had great sound, but the SD700 was much noisier and softer. Since I use the movie mode a lot, I may have to return this one."
5,Great pictures,"I bought this product used through amazon, and while the external appearance of the camera isn't fantastic in its current state, it still takes very clear, sharp pictures. I couldn't be happier with the bang I got for my buck!"
4,Small Camera That Delivers,"This little camera takes some really great day shots. I've had a little trouble with night shots being too dark. Definitely a good buy, very easy to use, and a little better zoom compared to others in the same price range."
5,Love the Canon SD700IS!,"Our family purchased this camera during the summertime, and we love it! The image stabilization really helps to eliminate problems caused by normal hand shaking. The quality of the photos is very pleasing, and we use the video option all the time to capture short segments, like seeing the kids doing something memorable. Also, the 4x zoom comes in very handy for getting a little closer (we're used to cameras with 3x zoom). I'd highly recommend this camera!"
4,"Not a valid review, but--","I really don't know as it was given as a gift. The person who received it seems quite happy with it, but I cannot fairly review."
3,Less than expected,"After tons of research reading all reviews I purchased the SD700 upgrading from an Olympus Camedia 3000. I've been using it for a few months now and am overall disappointed with the quality of my pictures. Lots of blurry pictures, lots of red eye, definitely not as good as my Olympus. I'm going to purchase another camera and give this one to a family member. Perhaps this is the tradeoff for a small camera. I do like the size, which allows me to take the camera with me more often, but I'm going to go back to getting a higher rated point and shoot."
5,Wonderful upbeat daily devotional!,"This is the best daily devotional I own. The Psalms are for the most part so uplifting and when I feel down, God in His way, brings the one my heart needs. Books were perfect and well packed. Ibought 4 for my Bible study group."
2,"Meh, get a better one","If you are starting out, then you know waterfowling can be pricey and you'll want to save money and get a call like this instead of a nicer one. Don't. You'll get this, find out its not very good and then have to buy a good one later. Save your $ on this and instead get one such as the Illinois River Valley calls."
1,Dont waste your money! Breaks or stops working in a month or so,I went through a few of these within a month of owning it. I received it damaged got a replacement and that one lasted less than a month then another and another and finally one worked for almost a year and that one broke too. You have to ship the unit at your expense every time as well and at 20+ pounds its expensive to ship and my closest place was a 2 hour drive.it doesnt make quality espresso at all its more like coffee even with premium beans that are ground just before brewing.Their customer service is useless as well they dont know anything about their units or making espresso.spend a couple hundred more and purchase a higher quality one that will last.
2,Good for a year!,"I bought this and was so excited to have a combination coffee/expresso machine. It has worked great and makes really good coffee and expresso. However, I was trying to brew a pot of coffee and it stopped working. I check everything and unplugged it to see if it was just a glitch. It completely stopped working. I contacted the company and they replied and ask for additional information. A week after I sent the information they replied with ""the warrenty has expired. please take your machine to an authorized dealer for repair"". As much as this thing cost, you would think that it would last longer than a year. I missed the year mark by 2 months. I am extremely disappointed!!!!!!!!! And I will not buy their products again!"
5,Grew Up Listening to Kenny,"When my family moved from Vermont to Massachusetts, we would make the 2-1/2 hour drive to visit my grandparents 'back home' quite frequently. My mother played Kenny Rogers on those roadtrips consistently for years, to the point where my (then) 2 year old brother and I memorized the words to all the songs. 20 years later, it's no wonder why we still know these songs and love them! Kenny's sweet and gravely voice is still a comfort. This is a quite complete collection of the original recordings, and a must for any Kenny Rogers fans. Even if you have most of these songs on tape and record, the cd box set is a great compilation. There are some personal favorites not on here, but all the important songs are on here, from ""Gambler"" to ""Eyes that See in the Dark""."
2,A battery that slowly stopped working,"At first the battery was great, it stayed charged for a super long time like my first battery with the krazr phone but already, about two weeks after I received the battery, it has started to lose power at increasingly faster and faster rates. I suggest you get a new phone before you buy another of these horrible battery's/phones"
3,lots of info: probably in there somewhere,"while this book appears to exhaustively document the program, I could rarely find helpful information when I ran into specific problems while using the program. I'm currently looking for a book with better clarity and organization"
2,Misadvertised,"The title is 3 cup. In actuality, it's less than one mug of coffee. Other than that, it's good. It should be advertised as a single serving size, not 3 cups."
1,Very Small,"Nowhere in the description of this product did it state that it was only six inches tall, and made three (4 oz) cups. What a disappointment!"
3,not as good as my old DeLonghi Grinder,This DeLonghi DCG59 grinder is not as strong as my old grinder and sometimes boggs down when a bean gets caught in the burr. It also has a lot of static electicity.
3,"OK, not great","Whoever designed this was strange. Two examples for your reading enjoyment:1) There is no visual indicatiion of the gind fineness. You have to count the ""clicks."" Silly2) You choose the amount of coffee by picking a letter. B=about two tablespoons; D=about four. REALLY silly.The machine also requires an occasional punch on the top to get the coffee to feed properly.I would NOT buy this unit again."
2,Poor design at a price,"I should have been warned by the other reviews---but noooo. I bought this quasi-useless gimcrack. The first clue about bad design is the top; the ""handle"" is a slippery ridge impossible to grip. The amount of ground coffee for any given setting---make that ""coffee dust,"" for this thing is the antithesis of coarse grind---varies considerably. I bought this grinder and passed along my cheap blade grinder to my brother. But now I think I want to swap back!On the coarsest setting, the coffee dust is so fine you may wish to use two paper filters. No way it would be suitable for a French press or percolator."
1,works great for about 2 months,"truly terrible product. Great style, but no substance. I got one and loved it, so a month later I ordered one for a friend. Mine completely died at the 2nd month, then my friend's died right on the same schedule. Thing is fussy when it does work, jams and clogs frequently. Spend your money on anything but this--amazon should stop carrying this lousy product, and I would like my money back for both of them. I think blade vs. burr grinding is not distinguishable in taste, but I just wanted a grinder with a bean hopper. This one is terrible. Makes me certain to avoid all DeLonghi products in the future, too."
2,Doesn't work for espresso settings,"I have had my grinder for a year now and although it still technically works, I am buying a new one. My grinder cannot grind for espresso on either of the fine espresso settings without getting plugged up every time (at which point you have to clean out the feeder hole by hand which makes a big mess!). It also has problems feeding the beans. I think the grinder probably works OK for settings other than espresso, however, if you do intend to use it to grind espresso I don't recommend it."
3,"Good grinder, but not for fine grinds","We've been using this grinder for three years now and it's performed well BUT . . .The grinder consistently clogs up when either grinding oily dark roasts OR grinding coffee fine for espresso. The problem is that the coffee builds up at the opening between the burr and the receptacle for ground coffee. Once the opening is clogged, the coffee backs up until the timer finishes. I keep a toothpick handy to unclog the opening and have learned to process coffee in small batches.The problem is exacerbated by the fact that you can't turn the grinder off (other than by unplugging it). Once the timer is set it will run until the time runs out. So if you discover the unit is starting to clog there's nothing much you can do until it's finished."
5,Great coasters,"These coasters are great because they really do keep condensation off of your furniture. The pattern in the Eiffel tower is a nice neutral, but still a bit unique."
3,Dancing in the late 1970s,"Instant Replay was a huge disco and chart hit in 1978. The album is one of the famous Tom Moulton mixes. With its catchy hook, bubbly optimism and full instrumental mix, the title track set the dance floors ablaze. Unfortunately the rest of the album doesn't quite live up to the promise of the hit. The long medley Countdown/This Is It was another dancefloor hit. It has some brilliant sax solos by Edgar Winter and some tuneful moments, especially in the second, This Is It part. Double-O-Love and Chocolate Box have a rock influence, while Love Is A Natural is an undistinguished disco ballad. The album concludes with Time And Space, a beautiful old style pop ballad with rousing vocals and a memorable tune. The album is pleasant enough overall but contains nothing outstanding besides the title track. Dan Hartman will always be remembered for Instant Replay, one of the most popular hits of 1978 in the golden age of disco."
4,Works Great!,"Pick your ice cream recipe, follow the directions in the manual. Putting together the ingredients might be time consuming, but actually freezing the ice cream isn't! 20 minutes tops if you use the smaller canister (one is built in, the other slightly smaller and slides in the built-in canister so you can make 2 batches of ice cream one after the other). I'm only giving it 4 stars because the mixer on the machine is REALLY LOUD (we put it in the laundry room and close the door while it's working)!"
5,Really Works! Best Ice Cream,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas thinking that she'd be thrilled since she's an ice cream addict. Instead she just looked at me and told us that we know ""that's she's lazy, and won't take the time to use it"". So after I recovered from her disappointed looks at me, I opened it and used it, and it makes great ice cream. I won't put raw eggs in though for fear of Salmonella. But with the help of Ben & Jerry's ice cream book, I'm a happy camper. BTW, even though my daughter admits to her lazyness, she still managed to go through the ice cream. Miracles do happen."
2,The description is deceptive,"I was so excited to order 2 of these for my rabbits. The description says that it is colored with edible- safe food dye. When they arrived I realized the tops of them were painted :(...!!!! I do not want my rabbits eating paint! I like the design, minus that. So I sawed the top of the carrot off then re-hooked them. Had I known the top was paint, I wouldn't have ordered these."
4,good stuff,"I got this for my 1 year old when she was 9 or 10 months because she was trying to throw things and nothing bounced. This was awesome because even though she never could manage to throw it and just drop it, it still managed to bounce enough to entertain her. Doesn't work so well for kicking especially on carpet but she loves to bounce it, and the noise she makes when rubbing her teeth on it makes her laugh so she loves it, which means I love it."
2,only lasted a couple of months,the family dog loves these balls but this one only lasted a couple of months we other ones lasted a few yrs.
3,The good & bad,"- Love the color, I'm fair with a pale olive undertone and this was the least orange I've tried- Darker and quicker than lotions (I normally use Jergens medium-dark)- Easy to apply, I used bare hands and didn't pay too close attention but no streaks and no stains if wash hands after- After the 3rd day using them, combined with spf 60 (neutrogena sensitive skin) I got a terrible rash on my chest that is sticking around. I'm not 100% sure if it's the wipes but I normally don't get rashes from sunscreen.- I'll use them again but only on my body. I'll stick to Clarins gel on face/neck/chest.- Definitely try them but test for a few days in a row well before an important event."
5,Amazing,"These are amazing!!! Have become a staple in my beauty routine. I consider myself more olive skinned (tan very well in the summer), but the winter always leaves me feeling pale. Not anymore! I use one towelette and am able to do my whole upper body .. Face, neck, arms, chest, stomach. Since it is the winter and I am only wearing pants right now I do not feel the need to use another towel to do my legs, but will most certainly do so once Spring hits! I was hesitant about using the product on my face but I have had no issues with breakouts because of it. I apply this every Sunday and Wednesday nights after a shower. It dries quickly and I am able to put my clothes on almost immediately. I have not experienced any rub-off onto my clothes. The tan lasts a couple days. As with all self tanning products, use sparingly on your elbows, knees, ankles and wrists!"
2,left streaks,"made my skin orange, and streaked, made parts of skin not tanned, had to wash off, and try again, not enough of product to use"
4,no mess tanning,"I've used this product many times, love the fact it travels with you, is not messy and gives a tan in a few hours. Also doesn't take long time to dry on your skin after applying and the smell is pretty good too."
3,they are ok,"I'm fair skinned so I don't tan at all. I have used self tanners before, these are ok. maybe it's me but the color still seemed uneven. and didn't last as long as other products I've used. the color does get dark fast and can be made darker by applying more."
4,This Heat will come to mind,"Excellent LONG prog, atmospheric/ambient drum dominated tracks that at times remind of the This Heat experiments but also remind of Camberwell Now and other Hayward works as well. Great! Recommended especially if you are a fan of any of the mentioned artists."
4,Happy Music You Will Love,"The Ray Conniff singers are fantastic on this album. The arrangements are rich, lovely, fun and light. The singing is fresh, modern, and perfectly sung. Music like this is the reason life can be beautiful. Albums such as this are sadly not made anymore; if they were we would be better off."
3,"Great game, but cheaply made","My 3-year-old loves this game, but it is cheaply made. Considering the target age group, I'm surprised Hasbro didn't make a more durable game. I'm also surprised that Hasbro doesn't have replacement parts available online because the parts break or fall apart so easily. Our key broke, our cards need to be replaced, and we need new balls as well! I would pay more money for a more durable game. I also think it's poor customer service on Hasbro's part not to have replacement parts available."
4,A wonderful game!,"I have to completely disagree with the one star reviewer. I find it delightful, and I like to play it. I think the hidden balls and key action keep kids amazingly engaged. The mystery factor is unique to this game, and it never feels like a boring review of numbers, letters, shapes and colors. NO batteries, and two levels of play! If your child knows every single lowercase letter and can count groups of objects to ten, then it is too easy for them. But most 3 to 4 year olds are working on these concepts (and some of this age range are still counting to 4, learning shapes, and the basic colors which is the content in level one). To me the only con is that the cards on each trap door should be laminated, because when children flip to level 2 play (the lowercase letters) they get too bent. I am here to buy this (yet again!) to give as a gift to a nephew who just turned 4."
4,Great Niece loved it,I gave this to my two year old great niece for Christmas who will be three January 4th and she could not wait to see what it was. She liked using the key to open the doors...little trouble pushing down on the key to open the doors but finally got the hang of it and loved it when the treasure chest opened which was a good surprise for her. She is learning her numbers and shapes...very educational. She liked the balls that she would find in some of the boxes. We asked her who gave her the game and she mentioned my name so that was letting us know she has a good memory considering all the gifts that she received. Her mom and dad were pleased.
1,A Really Cheaply-Made Game That Is Completely Uninspiring,My daughter got this as a birthday present. It seems like a waste of money to me. There are so many more interesting and inspiring games to play that involves colors and numbers. This one didn't even pass the 2 week test for my four-year-old. And no adult in our house would honestly want to play it. School Zone's cuteCrazy Eightscard game for $[...] is a better bet for a game with two play options. Or have some real family fun withOrchardorSelecta Piccobello Laundry Gameor Corso Cannelloni. Those all get 5-star recommendations.
4,One of his favorite Christams Presents!!,"My 3 year old son got this for Christmas. He LOVES it! After the first time with Mom and Dad, he just kept playing it,by himself or with us! He even takes good care of it and makes sure he cleans it all up afterwards!!It is very educational as it teaches colors, counting,and number recognition! After playing this game, my son can now recognize his numbers out of context of the game! He is really learning! I have yet to see a Cranium game not be amazing and I am glad I got this one!"
5,one of the best tv drama.,I really loved this show. Good story line and a wonderful cast. Kerry Washington and Tony have beautiful chemistry together.
5,FAST and FURIOUS!!!!!,OMG!!! I love this show. I watch it. I also tape it on my DVR so I can go back and watch it again. It moves so fast that I miss stuff. When the DVD came out I jumped on it. So I spent an afternoon and was able to sit and watch all the episodes back to back.....It is a must have........
5,"Quick, clean and exactly as expected","Have never purchased a download but this was so easy and was delivered exactly as expected. Easy downloads, plays beautifully and loved the deal for the whole season instead of each individual episode"
1,Interesting...,"As soon as it gets to the ...'being gay is your alibi"" story line, it becomes offensive! Why would you try and save a right wing decorated soldier who shouts about being honorable and a Deacon at his church..but can't come out! Let him go to prison for murder, who cares!Shonda is trying to be Sorkin..and doesn't have the depth! This is NOT the West Wing. I will avoid further eps...shame, cos initially it did show a glimmer of promise."
4,Scandal season 1,"Excellent show! This is the first time I have used Amazon for digital purchases, well worth it.Can't wait for Season 2."
2,Pathos settles in this pit.,"I expected to learn something from this book and was let down with every revealed secret. Unfortunately her bias is too obvious and in the spirit of Fleet Street instead of our loving Creator.Because I was able to buy some copies at a distress sale, I shared her research with a dozen friends. To sum up what they said to me later, ""You gotta be kidding!""Still, it's better than Talk TV."
1,Chistian Bashing,...that's all this book does is bash the Christians that started the Order of the Eastern Star.
1,Preposterous,"I didn't like this book. There was far too much speculation and heresay. The sources are vague and inconsistent. It seems like any time the author came close to making a point, every source was either a second or thrid hand perriferal person and leaves us with very little true knowledge of Jackie WIlson's career. However, it was very sad to learn that after Jackie fell ill in the mid seventies, Lynn Guidry (the woman who CLAIMS she was his last wife) vanished for 2 years with whatever money jewels,furs and cars that Jackie owned. It leaves the reader curious in what may have been her involement in Jackie's demise. This becomes particularly intruiging when one considers her method of coaxing Jackie to take her on the road while she was married to another man, with the lie that she was dying of cancer."
4,"Great purchase, very much reccommended for Josh Kirby fans","Great purchase. Understandably the quality wouldnt be 100% as its an old production and a rare find, but the packaging was good and quality of the disk was perfect although the picture jumped a few times while watching but it didnt disturb the enjoyment of the classic series.Thanks very much, awesome buy of my favourite childhood series!!"
5,My fav stoner/doom/down-tempo album!,"What can I say..? This is actually a perfect release, every song on here is great, they combine down-tempo sludgy songs with up-tempo stoner grooves, and a mouthharp... goddamn this is great.. This is one of the gems in my collection, and I have ALOT of albums..It is worth it.. Get it! in fact get two, one for your house, and one for your car!"
5,Superb playing & recording of early strings...,"If you're a fan of string music, this recording will amaze you. The skill of the musicians on comes through in the pace, rhythem and tonal quality of their bold playing. It's never stuffy or restrained. The arrangements are very engaging, and the recording is pretty much a reference-quality disc."
3,Is ok.,"Buy it for ""Battle of NEw Orleans"" and ""sink the bismark."" Enjoy it for ""whispering pines"" and ""north to alaska."""
2,"RIGHT TOOL,WRONG COLLET SIZE.","PNEUMATIC PENCIL GRINDER ADVERTIZED WITH A 1/8"" COLLET BUT CAME WITH A 3MM COLLET.NEVER HAS BEEN USED BECAUSE WE ONLY USE GRINDING TIPS WITH 1/8"" SHANKS.BY THE TIME I FOUND THIS OUT,IT WAS TOO LATE TO GET A REFUND.THIS WAS THE ONLY ITEM I EVER ORDERED FROM AMAZON THAT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY."
5,Nice!,"Typical Thirstystone quality. The images on this coaster set are quite clear and detailed. Unique, I hadn't seen this design before. Pair these coasters with the ""Thirstystone Cherry Pedestal Wood Coaster Holder"" and you have a great display holder that accents the colors in these coasters."
2,Columbus,"Columbus was a man of his time, obeying the laws of the time. Judging him using the laws of today isn't something an educator should waste time on. The real issue is how concepts of morality changed over time."
2,Prodyne Cocktail Forks.,"Darling cocktail forks. Unfortunately in 3 attempts, design elements on some forks had fallen off. Part of this was Amazon shipping. Horribly packed. Forks fell out in transit. Was having party so finally gave up, paid for 3 sets and combined them to equal one complete set."
1,Simplistic,"I waited almost 6 weeks to get this book for my 12 year old Asperger's son and was very disappointed. While there were a few pages that are good, it really describes the very autistic Asperger's child rather than those that are higher functioning."
3,A little disappointing,"I bought this for my 8-y/o who was recently diagnosed with Asperger's. I read it first and thought it was a little on the juvenile side considering my son but gave it to him to read anyway. He HATED it and said it was stupid.I had also bought ""Can I Tell You About Asperger's?"" which is also written on a younger reading level. It was MUCH more appealing to my son and he read it several times."
3,Maybe For the Very Young,"I bought this book for my son with the idea of using it when I first dicussed his diagnosis with him. After reading through it first though, I couldn't bring myself to do that. It's composed of little words and short simple sentences, and quite frankly, my Asperger's son is a walking dictionary. The last thing I wanted to do was give him the idea that he is intellectually impaired in addition to all his social issues. Yes, he takes language too literally, but he does it multisyllabically.My boy did, however, very much enjoy the picture-book ""All Cats have Asperger's."" The language in that book is equally simplistic, but he was taken in by the comparisons to cats, which he loves."
4,A great Child to Child Perspective,This is a great Child to child perspective on AS. It displays some humor while the child voices AS as he sees it from his family.
2,Asperger's Huh? A Child's Perspective,"This is supposed to be from a child's perspective but since it was written by an adult it comes across as somewhat fake. My 8yr old with Aperger's read it and complained that ""kids don't talk that way"". If you can't impress an 8yr old you aren't going to impress adults or professionals."
3,Andrew Jackson was not the man public school remembers him,"Will the real Andrew Jackson please stand up. This book fails to emphasize Jackson's many violations of the Constitution of the United States, including Jackson's removal of Indians from Florida as he sent them on the Trail of Tears."
3,Decent Product; False Advertising,"I don't know much about beach balls. They're quality, as far as I can tell. Lightweight, round, and brightly colored; what more do you ask for in a beach ball?However, the claim seems to be that the ball is 24"" diameter. That measurement is actually half the circumference. The diameter is slightly under 14"". Most people probably aren't that picky about the size of their beach ball, but if it matters to you, be warned!"
4,Helped my Shy Daughter.,"Well I have an assertive daughter and a shy daughter who was letting her ""friend"" bully her the way that girls do. This helped my daughter understand that you don't need to feel bad all of the time when you have a real friend. I would say that I am glad that I added this book to my library and have lent it to 1 of my other friends."
2,Very Simplistic,"I purchased this book for my 9 year old daughter and found it to be overly simplistic. Very short story (pitched at about a 2nd grade reading level) with only one practical suggestion about what to do. There was a list of 8 tactics at the end, but they were so generic (tell the bully to stop; report it to an adult; use humor to deflect bullying...) and so lacking in examples that my daughter's response to every one was ""I tried that; I already do that.""This type of bullying typically occurs when girls hit fourth grade through middle school, yet the content of the book comes across as something you would read to a much younger child. Very disappointing."
1,AVOID THIS MACHINE!,"I got this product at a ridiculously cheap price, so I thought I might as well try it since I had had an inexpensive Krups machine years ago and was pretty impressed with it at the time. Currently I use a pretty good mid-level Solis machine, but figured it might work out to have this back up for whenever my current one died.First of all, I was completely disappointed with the quality of espresso. There was no crema on top, which is the hallmark of any pump-driven espresso machine. The espresso was also weak and watery. In addition, and I think this is INEXCUSABLE, there is nothing in the instruction book that warns you to prime the pump before use, which basically can fry your machine if you don't do. Luckily I knew this from owning previous makers, and called their support line to verify that it needed to be done. And the woman who I spoke to seemed barely to care!WORTHLESS!"
2,great as long as it lasts,I bought my Delonghi machine in August and as of yesterday it has died. While it was working I was quite happy though - great coffee latte. The only thing was that it was leaking through the steam wand and made a big mess on the counter but I took care of theat by moving the wand above the drip tray. I'm disappointed that it didn't last longer. I'm upgrading to a Gaggia.One thing I learned: Don't write reviews right after purchase and don't trust reviews written right after purchase
3,"Acceptable Cappuccino, but machine dont last long","I bought this machine 10 months ago, my first pump driven cappuccino maker.For a novice it is an okay machine. A way to learn the tricks of making an acceptable cappucino, to practice the art of frothing.I do not use the machine that often. Two cups of cappucino 2 to 4 times a week. After 10 months of use, the steam pump is not producing the steam at the same pressure. I can not get the milk frothed as it used to, just when I finally got better at this. I have tried to contact DeLonghy 1-800 service number. Got an answering machine but not a call back.To start up it is an okay machine. For keepers, better look at something more solid."
4,Better than starbucks :),"I love having my own homemade espresso machine. We get the pre-ground espresso ground beans from local grocery stores. I've had the machine for about a year and we probably use it once a week or more. You'll want to get a spoon if you plan to make lattes/cappucinos (or if you use the steaming option for drinks). We didn't want to spend $1000 for one of the nicer machines because we might as well go to a coffee shop twice/day every day for that money and not have to clean up after ourselves.Honestly, I think this machine makes better lattes than the generic coffee shops. Homemade is almost always better. I don't drink straight espresso. I have made lattes, cappucinos, americanas, and used the steamed milk for hot chocolate. It's all gonna depend on your espresso beans, but (to me) they all tasted great! The machine works better with fattier milks (its harder to use skim milk for the froth)."
3,"Not 48"" diameter","This is evidently a common criticism of these so-called 48"" inch diameter beach balls, but the comment hasn't been made for this particular seller. The actual diameter is a far less impressive 32"" or so. The manufacturer label lists the ball only as ""jumbo"", so it's clearly a seller issue. Unlike the other jumbo beach balls on Amazon, my delivered ball matched the picture. In fairness to the seller, it's obvious that the model in the picture is not holding a 48"" diameter ball (unless she is about 8 feet tall). The ball appears sturdy, and it came with a patch kit. It's just not as big as I had expected."
1,WORST EVER! Only Toasts on ONE SIDE!! WORTHLESS for TOAST!!!!!,"THE WORST! IT ONLY TOASTS ON ONE SIDE! WORTHLESS for a toaster! This is perhaps the WORST Toaster Oven I've ever had or seen in my life. Delonghi boasts that it can toast 8 slices of toast at a time, but what they fail to tell you (and it's even in the instruction booklet!!), is IT ONLY TOASTS ON ONE SIDE!!! The racks don't pull out, and there is very little space between them, so it's nearly impossible to get the toast out to turn it over and toast the other side!! It's a total waste of electricity and time!! MY SISTER HATES IT AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET A REFUND NOW!!!!! I wouldn't give you 10 cents for it. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO OPTION FOR ZERO OR NEGATIVE STARS OR I WOULD HAVE SELECTED IT!"
5,Burden's milk cow,"A lot of people get the Borden milk cow (Borden's milk is Elsie the Cow, created in the 1930's) confused with the Elmer's School Glue Cow, which is actually a bull (Elmer's Glue is Elmer the bull). It turns out that they're married. Also, the Borden Company is the same company responsible for both Borden's milk and Elmer's Glue.Borden introduced for the first time to the general public a white Cascorez Glue, which was later changed to Elmer's Glue-All after Elmer.Their offspring included Beulah, Beauregard (born 1949), and twins Lobelia and Larabee (born 1959).So, the Borden Company is the same company responsible for Elmer's Glue.Anyone thinking this is milk, it's not, it's School Glue, 1 Gallon."
1,Don't buy this it's outdated.,"Outdated. Photoshop 6 is out, and this covers Photoshop 2, don't waste you money when there are better books on the market."
5,A Superb Resource,"I have read many Photoshop books. This is the first Photoshop book I have read that has practical, useful advice that applies to real world situations. The book is layed out very well, with clear instructions for each technique described. Photoshop CS is part of the book, but the techniques described can be used on any retouching program. I could see anyone with an understanding of their retouching program finding this book very useful from a novice to a professional. I highly recommend this book, it is the best Photoshop book I have read."
3,Not as large as I expected,Everything about these socks is just ok. I wear a 13 wide shoe and these socks are still too small. I wouldn't even consider these socks if you wear over size 13.
5,LATIN FLAVOUR,"The great Ray Conniff demonstrating that he can be a fantastic arranger of Latin melodies as classic as BESAME MUCHO and TEMPTATION (Performed in the unique Conniff style); including songs as pretty as STRANGER IN PARADISE, the very catching I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN, big ballads like SOFTLY AS IN A MORNING SUNRISE (sublime), NIGHT AND DAY, the precious and melancholy DEEP PURPLE and SUMMERTIME (What a trumpet!!), and delightful pieces like TOO YOUNG and SAY IT WITH MUSIC; a great disc you need in your ""Easy Listening"" collection !!"
5,I hope this works,Im pregnant and bought this just incase my water breaks when sleeping it happened before. I hope this protects my mattress . I will keep you posted on if it works..
2,Boring,"I'm a pretty big Beck fan, but this book rambled on and on. The author put in so much detail about people I slightly cared about, that I skimmed a lot of the material. It felt like a magazine article that had been padded up to make a book. I feel like I know very little more about Beck than when I started reading. I guess if you're into statistical information with regards to who played on what song and who directed which video (this information takes up half of the book) and what songs Beck played at each appearance, you'd like this book. As for me, I expected to learn more about Beck as a person and have more insights into his songs."
2,Seems like all filler...,"The first few chapters of this book were good, Jovanovic had material on Beck's childhood and how he started as a musician. Then as soon as the book gets to the part when Beck releases Mellow Gold it gets boring. I, personally do not like Jovanovic at all. He acts like he is a music buff. He says Cake copies Beck. If anyone has heard Cake, then they know they sound nothing like Beck. They're completely different and unique. He needs more information to back up claims like that. I didn't flip through the book before I got it, and the 2nd half is all boring nonsense about individual songs, videos and art. It wasn't about Beck as a person at all.A tad boring, but If your a hardcore Beck fan, then it's worth a read."
3,This book promises way more than it delivers.,"A review I read asked, ""Who is the real illusionist: Red or Rosa?"" That question was never answered to my satisfaction. The book's premise is intriguing; but it isn't enough to carry this story, and it soon falters. The magic tricks aren't magical and there's no magic in this love story. The author relies on sensationalism to carry the plot, but it soon turns to just plain sleaze. One plus - I didn't consider not finishing, but neither am I recommending it to friends."
2,The sizzle is better then the steak,"What happens when a friend, a guy you like and respect, suddenly starts gushing about the most amazing woman he just fell in love with? Then you meet her, and, frankly, she's annoying. The more he raves, the more you wonder why you liked him in the first place. That's how it feels in the early chapters of Martyn Bedford's latest novel, The Houdini Girl, a genre-bender that starts out as a ""most fascinating woman I ever met"" novel but quickly turns ugly. Go to http://www.gadfly.org for complete review."
1,Forget about it!,"I tried, I really tried to like this grinder. But after weeks of frustrating shaking, clogging & more grounds spilled on the counter than in my coffee filter, I gave up and bought...a manual grinder! I may expend more energy in the grinding, but none in the clean up the DeLonghi DCG49 required."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought the unit in May 2006 and by October 2006 it sopped working. I could hear a screw (?) rattling around in the base. Spoke with the Customer Service at DeLonghi who advised me the unit is no longer manufactured, but still under warranty. Too bad I didn't know that *before* I bought it. They want me to mail it to a service station for repairs. LOL! Terrible design--top lid comes loose when grinding; chute jams easily; hard to really clean; static cling on container; noisy; ""dead-man's button"" instead of on-off switch. I'm cutting my loss and giving it a toss!"
5,Sturdy and easy to hang,"Exactly what we wanted at the office, these stack nicely on the wall, are made of sturdy plastic, and were easy enough for us to hang without any hassle. They made organizing our desks a lot easier!"
3,"good, but a little expensive for the materials involved","The item arrived in good condition with the necesary mounting screws. I had to line them up on a table to create a template for mounting them on the wall; it would be nice if they came with a template. I had to purchase 3 3-packs to meet my needs and once they were in place I didn't really feel like I had $50 worth of acrylic material, but even though the price was high, they are doing the job."
3,Eh...,Item is in three separate pieces that must be mounted separately with screws. Not sure whether they could be successfully mounted with stick tape. They arrived without screws. They arrived scratched a bit. Eh...
2,Meh,"One of the corners on one of the ones I received was broken, so I can't hang that one up.""Includes double-sided tape and screws."" - Mine did not come with double sided tape."
1,Green mat has changed (and not for the better),"We like the green mat so much that we received as a baby gift over a year ago that we decided to purchase another one. I saw some negative comments about the blue mat & chose to go with the green, hoping for a better outcome. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Like others have said about the blue mat, the material for the green placement is clearly different now. It's a much brighter shade of green, but more importantly, the suction cups didn't work on Day 1. We've been using our older green mat for months now & the suction cups on that one still work fine. I suspect that, over time, this green one also will begin warping like others have described with the blue version."
2,not what I expected,"I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about. But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off. Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck!I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table."
1,Does no one else have a child who grabs and pulls this up???,"This placemat seemed like a terrific idea for eating out and eating at the table, but it has two fatal flaws:1) Even if the table is the kind of surface on which suction cups work (formica, glass), they're not so strong that a determined toddler (mine is 17 months) can't peel them right up. The placemat becomes just one more toy to fling around.2) The catch trough is easily bent out of shape so that it catches nothing.We'll be sticking (pun intended) with the disposable adhesive mats, future landfill waste that they are."
1,worthless. buy disposable ones that actually stick,"The suction cups are worthless. When this arrived, I tried it one time and my son threw the entire meal on the floor within about half a minute. I am mad at whoever designed this stupid thing, let alone decided it was worth $12 (including shipping!). It is still, a week later, curled up (won't lay flat) and the suction cups don't stick to anything. More of a toy than a placemat. I am back to the disposable placemats with sticky stuff on the back."
2,Misleading,"I usually do not write reviews, but since everyone gave such a high rating I thought that people needed to know the other side before they spent their money. When we go out the only thing that my child does is lift the scoop part up and down until everything on the tray goes flying. The suction cups hold so-so. I think that this is a great idea and a great product for older children. Experiment with your child. If something is in front of them such as a suction cup bowl, do they try to lift it up? If so this might not be the product for you."
3,"Doesn't work everywhere, but doable","It doesn't stick to everything, and it's not good on round tables or if there's a tablecloth (obviously) but it does help keep her food off public tables in a variety of situations. She's not too bad about pulling it up, so sometimes I could just lay it down and put something at the top to hold it and it worked ok. It also is really stained from tomato products & I can't remove it."
2,huge dissapointment,"the only thing that stands out on this album is gza and rass kass and rza's biochemical equation which by the way was all him because MF Doom killed it with his weak verse, if only deck and gza were on biochemical eq it would of been way better even classic status, rza kept it alive though. Other then that undergrounds so called "" finest "" didnt step up well at all and the beats lacked except for a few, and might I also add that rza's birth of a prince wasnt very good aswell, seems his beats went commercial and he doesnt come strong at all, makes me =("
4,Great Artistic Variety!,"Great Wu-Tang compilation. Would have liked to have seen Ghostface, Raeqwon Or Method Man on a track or two. Hottest track is definitly Verses. Don't sleep on the underated R.A. The Rugged Man on the J-Live Assisted Give It up. Non-affilated artists like Tragedy Khadafi, Ras Kass, Del Tha Funky Homosapien & MF Doom make this disc a gem. Dreddy Kruger is outstanding on the boards. He dose a great job maintaining the ""Wu-Tang"" Sound/Atmosphere."
2,One note on the Production,"Looks great on paper,but just a few hits. I love seeing Aesop and Del together especially. However, I don't know if its just me, but I am getting tired of the same old soul samples being all ""chipmunked"". You will definatly find a lot of that on here. Seems like that track with MF Doom coulda been good, but his lazy quirky rhymes don't go with the chipmunked ""ohhhh ohhh oh"" and the violins in the back. The high pitched repetiveness gets on my nerves more than it makes me bob my head. Like others have said, had a lot more potential. Maybe its my taste, but this ""chipmunk beat"" trend going on is killing me."
1,"Look nice, but basically worthless","I've been looking for a sturdy pair of poultry shears as all the ones with plastic handles I seem to break within a month or two. I liked the look of these with the solid metal handles and thought that I'd finally found a pair of shears worthy of my abuse...well, I only (tried to) use them once! They are very unwieldy and the spring mechanism is so stiff that I had to pry them open every time I sqeezed them shut. After about the 1st 4 or 5 cuts my hand hurt so bad that I threw them into the sink desperately looking for the old ones I'd thrown aside. Beware - don't judge a book by its cover!"
2,Waste of money.,"This was the first uke I had ever bought, but I've been playing the ukulele for over a year now and i can honestly say that I wish I hadnt got this uke at all. For the amount of money that this thing cost, you could get a much better one here on amazon.ProsIt playsMade of mahoganyConsThe action is way too highThere are flaws everywhere on it (scratches, chips, bad paint-work)The strings that come with it suckThe fretboard itself is unattractiveDoesn't keep in tuneThe sound is very dryOverall you could get a much better uke for 40 bucks on amazon. I would advise that you look elsewhere. (Also, if you're looking to learn ukulele, then I would advise you to get a concert ukulele, soprano's are more for show.)"
5,so much to know,"no matter how much you think you know about the natural northern world, specifically flora and fauna, this book knows more. sure, we all know that a spider's webbing can be twice as strong as steel for its size but did you know that spiders can custom blend their webbing for different tasks? stretchy, sticky, tough..umm...buoyant..er ,well, other qualities relevant to spiders. its like a more basic, easier to understand kinda string theory.. sorry, slipping off topic here. this book is great, breezily written, funny even. get it, put it in the bathroom and in just 30 mins a day.. no,wait, that's the learning company..you will be able to amaze and confound all your friends from wood chucks to marine biologists with your arcane knowledge of the great outdoors. well, hey, its working that way for me."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought it, turned it on, and then turned it off. This was not money well spent, an amateur video without helpful advice."
1,"WRONG IMAGE! And you know this, but still keep it up!!!","Considering this page was made by the seller, I find that it was with malicious intent. The product image uploaded is not of the manual they ship out to you. They ship you the cheaper ""single"" book and not the shop manual (which is 4 books like pictured) you think you're buying. Unfortunately, it's too much of a hassle to argue with them and get a refund and go through all the fuss. I got the bit of info. I needed for from the ""regular"" Chiltons manual they sent me; had to open the plastic wrapping/etc., so I can't return it.I'm guessing returning and re-buying the right books as pictured would cost me more in shipping/etc. Very disappointed."
2,No Sound Streaming Capture Ability,"I have been happy with this board now for two years. But lately, I tried capturing audio from the Internet and am unable to do so. There is no way to use ""Stereo-Mix"" for the sound source with the Sigmatel sound drivers. It appears Intel deliberately had Sigmatel leave this option out. Only three solutions available to user, Mic in, Line in and Line out. And because there is few PCI slots, a sound card addition is difficult."
2,terrible,I agree with his basics facts but insulted byrepetitions and chapter summaries. This couldhave been great eight page essay but not enough for book. What intelligent readerneeds to three page summary at end of everychapter?
2,Preston Bailey's Design for Entertaining.,The book is well done and gives some great ideas for a highend event. I purchased this book from Amazon as a new book and received a used book with handwriting inside. I wrote to Amazon and described the fact. No response. Buyer be aware!
4,Esperaba más....,"Está chido el Single, pero esperaba remixes más innovadores, el único padre es el de Oakenfold, los otros están medio raritos, usaron casi los mismos sonidos de la versión original, salvo el de Calderone que repite la misma fórmula contagiosa.... por qué no experimentaron con un Downtempo o una versión metalera de la canción?? definitavemente esperaba más...."
4,Seems to work okay,"I was able to do 3 layers of this on my 3 IKEA chairs. Not quite sure if it works as a stain blocker yet, but I can say that it doesn't change the color of the cover, and the feel of the chair after application is the same."
3,Great on some fabric,"Worked great on cotton.It worked great on a Carhartt 12oz cotton duck jacket,was able to completely soak it down with the Scotchguard.Water beads up on it and mild dirt wipes off clean. Not so good on an older Columbia 100% nylon shell water repellent jacket,that after many washings had lost it's repellency. With only a light spraying of Scothchguard it made a waxy white coating that I thought had ruined the jacket. Would not wash out in wash machine. It took an abusive hand washing with a lot of detergent to remove it.Jacket was OK. Now I use Atsco Silicone Waterguard on all my nylon water repellent jackets to make them stain and completely waterproof."
1,Read the fine print,"You might like what the product does to your furniture, but do you like what it does to your body and to your kids?Read about scotchgard on EHOW, type in Dangers of Scothgard and let me know if you still enjoy your furniture as much!"
5,I have three. No excuses for hitting me in the dark,"These little lights are great. I have one facing backwards and one on each side (tied with the very convenient base to the tongs of my front fork). They're bright, they have a variety of attention grabbing flash patterns, and they must be very energy efficient because I haven't had to replace the batteries and I've used them a lot."
4,solid easy,"installed on my helmet easily for extra lighting. only had it a few days, so we'll see on durability and life. Came with cheap batteries, but given the price, that is to be expected."
3,A little painful for my small arthritic hands.,"The wooden handle I need to cover with a soft fabric to ease the discomfort. The wheels squeak continually. The rolling does feel good, however, on sore muscles and feet and arms and legs. I miss my old much smaller device that was a plastic roller with tiny ridges. The handle had small grips for my fingers. Since it broke after many years, I have been hunting for an equivalent."
5,illluminated manuscripts' inspired visions,"Seductive rhythms and lush landscapes envelope you into a world of mystery and wonder. Categories of ""computer animation"" and ""new age"" poorly describe these magical fractal dreamscapes. You journey through an intimate wonderland of dark and sunlit places as you submit your body to the languid pulsations of the hypnotic music. HIGHly recommended."
1,RIP OFF ALERT! This has NOTHING to do with the movie!,"With the title emblazoned in large letters, and the song titles featured as they are, some entity (London? Decca? Allen Klien? Andrew Oldham?) is trying to make you, the innocent buyer, think that this is the ""soundtrack to the movie."" It ain't. It's all the original studio recordings. To the best of my knowledge, the only way one can ""access any of the soundtrack"" is to burn-your-own-CD from the tape or disc of the movie itself. I HAVE heard that ""Satisfaction"" and ""Sympathy"" are available on a boot from Russia, but I ain't really interested in doing business there. Get ""40 Licks"" and ""Get Yer Ya Yas Out."" That's all you need."
4,A Hot Piece,"I've been playing the Lead 342 for over 3 years. I researched it through the studies by John Lynch. it has a great feel. I get a great tone and strength in the upper range, without straining and that's most important!I find that my endurance has doubled. I can play a 3-4 hr gig without a problem. John's studies have helped me reform my embouchure to be efficient finally after 35 years of playing!Kudos to John and to the Asymmetric Lead 342!!!!!Bill Crawford"
5,Wonderful beading book,"This book is one of my favorites... It has a big variation in the types of projects offered. There are projects for all beading levels, and each one is clearly marked with the complexity. The instructions are clear - there is even a section on the basic stitches, with excellent diagrams.I also enjoyed the background stories that accompany each project. It's a nice touch."
