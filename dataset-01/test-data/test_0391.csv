3,Yamaha UX16 Midi interface,I comes with no instructions. You have to be familiar with the instruction booklet of the instrument you bought it for. It seems to work okay.
1,can not be able to return,I bought the product and when i recieved it the zipper was broken. I tried to email the so I can return it but they haven given me a authorization number to retun it and get my money back. Not a good company if your product is damaged. There is no way of getting in contact with them. And the you are stuck with it.I still have it in the hopes I can return it soon.
5,Perfect fit for my husband,"My husband loves these sunglasses and this is the second set we've purchased so far. The first set came with four different types of interchangeable lenses. This new pair only came with two sets of lenses, but the second set is a much improved lense which easily compensates for the fewer sets. The second lense works amazingly well in low light, dusk, and even at night!"
4,Helpful book,"Provides the tips I was looking for to get started writing a novel. Even if I don't ever write a novel and/or write one that doesn't get published, it was a good read."
2,Beginners BEWARE,"I am a published novelist with good reviews, and I got there in large part by reading every book about writing that I could get my hands on. This one offers some limited value for people who already have a solid grasp on the basics, but if you are a beginner, I would advise you to skip this book, at least until you've read quite a few others. And get it from your library rather than spending money on it. Starting with the fact that the author incorrectly explains first/second/third person to the premise that your novel must start with a premise (to insist on starting with one may cripple and oversimplify your book, if you are lucky enough to not have it turn into an unpublishable sermon)...Approach with caution. I believe the best advice is to read a lot of books on writing so you can pick and choose what elements you think will work best for you from the various approaches out there."
2,Disappointing and formulaic,"Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as ""Cheaters never win"") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer."
4,Simply stated,"Writing a novel can be daunting, but this book provides the answers to plot, character, structure, voice and scene in clear, distinct ways."
3,Confusing search,"I know nothing about the product itself. I had to return it, because I bought it by mistake -- it showed up on the DDR2 search even though it is a DDR[1]."
5,It works!,"I used Crucial's software to find out which memory card to get. I ordered the recommended type, received it within 2 days, I installed it in my laptop and it works. 10 minutes to order, 5 minutes to install. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. It's been in use for about 5 weeks, no problems."
1,less than pleased,"I've had my Cuisinart for about 20 years, so no surprise that the plastic parts have broken (I probably shouldn't have put them in the dishwasher). I bought this replacement part and it's thin, flexible plastic and not nearly as sturdy as the original. In order to make it snap into place, I have to fiddle around with the latching part on it to make it push the button down on the machine like it's supposed to. It's too flimsy to latch into place without major assistance. This involves turning the whole part while pushing on the latch with my finger or a spoon handle which isn't easy to do. I should have just bought a new processor, but I was trying to be environmentally correct and not throw away a perfectly good motor. If I could rate this part a zero, I would."
3,Simple exerciser,"This exerciser is easy to user and easy to store. It is a good exerciser for those who may have mobility issues because it can be used sitting to exercise the legs, and place it on a bed or similiar surface, and the user can exerise the arms and upper body. The only real negative is that it slides away being used for the legs, and I ofen have to repopsition it. To exercise the arms, it's easy to first place tClose-up Image of an Exercise Machine Computer Photographic Print, 24"" x 18""he unit against the legs and exercise the arms while standing."
2,It's Required Text,"It is a very basic book and covers secondary dominants and tritone changes. If you are new to this, it gives a general overview which might be useful. The examples are nice, but again, it's basic. If you are looking for cool piano voicings, try Mark Levine or Frank Mantooth. If it were not a required text, I would not have gotten this book."
5,precious memories,I ordered this book because it holds a special place in my childhood memories. It is a precious book to read to little girls especially. We have lost stories like this in todays books. Thank you for making it available.
5,A Must Read!!!,"I have read all three books in this trilogy and couldn't put any of them down. I have to date read almost all of Ms. Roberts work and have thoroughly enjoyed all her books. This trilogy is emotionally touching, as well as provoking!"
3,"""Holding""... just ok for me.","""Finding A Dream"" to me was not as good as (""Daring To Dream"") the first book in the trilogy. Maybe it's because Margo was a little more exciting and Josh was a little more...Josh (what a great character he was!). Kate's story was ok, but I guess to tell Margo's and Laura's story Kate's has to be told as well. Now I'm onto ""Finding The Dream"" (Laura's story), and I can't wait to see what kind of man Roberts has in store for her."
4,Holding the Dream,Nora Roberts' second book in the Dream trilogy was great! When I read the book I felt as though I were the character in the story. I can't wait to read the last novel of the trilogy! It is a book that I recomend everyone to read.
2,Same Old Same Old,"If you've read Nora Robert's Unfinished Business, then you've basically read this book too. There are many similarities between the two, each as predictable as the next. I've realized that a lot of Robert's older books have the same plot line as some of the newer ones, just with different character names and a different setting.Read Holding the Dream only if you want to read it after Finding the Dream and before Daring to Dream, but don't expect too much or an exciting read."
1,Gross Misrepresentation/Nothing to do with F-16,"I'll even be harder than the previous reviewer on this absolute piece of trash. Here is why. The DVD, like the previous reviewer has stated, probably has less if not only 5 minutes of F-16 footage and it is uninspiring at that. There are no discussions of flight characteristics, no in cockpit views, no comparisons to adversarial or contemporary competitor aircraft. There is nothing ""in-depth"" about it. The only footage provided are some basic test flights showing basic flight maneuvers. That footage is in the opening and closing credits of the film. The rest of the film is dedicated to the history of air warfare and it does not even cover that appropriately. The whole DVD is about 30 minutes long.Don't waste your money on this poorly constructed and falsely marketed piece of junk."
5,Another treat for Lego enthusiasts!,"My son picked this out as something he wanted for Christmas and was absolutely delighted with it. Of course he finished it much faster than I would have wanted . . . but he enjoyed it immensely, and it will soon be disassembled for reassembly sometime in the future."
1,THIS IS MORE LIKE A F FLICK FOR FLUNK,THIS IS A REALLY STUPID MOVIE SO STUPID THAT MY CATS COULDN'T WATCH IT ANY MORE MY 9 YRD OLD COULD DO A BETTER MOVIE THEN THIS STUPID MOVIE I WOULDN'T SPEND MY TIME TO EVEN LOOK FOR IT. BLAIR WITCH PROJECT WAS BETTER EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE THAT ONE EITHER THAT WAS ALSO STUPID
1,Save your money,"Save your money and wait until this book is released in paperback. Obsidian Butterfly is poorly written, poorly edited and a major disappointment. Anita is getting more and more violent yet moans that she is a monster, get real, sweetie, change some of your ways or quit complaining.. I am hoping that Book 10 of this series is better than Book 9...Anita doesn't need a vacation, she needs help."
3,"Really good, but errors a problem","I highly enjoyed the plot and character interactions in this book (though there could have been more Jean-Claude and Richard) but the large number of errors kept getting in the way of the reading. Scenes were repeated, names were mispelled. Where were the editors for this book?"
3,indecisive plot strategy saved by author's style,"This was my first exposure to the work of Laurell Hamilton, and I really enjoyed her style of writing[her sentence construction/phrases].However, I found myself putting this book aside on numerous occasions because I grew impatient with the endless series of graphic scenes that, while interesting, seemed to diminish the continuity of the plot. I was overwhelmed with spectacle...like a tv movie, broken by an endless series of commercials. By the time I was two-thirds of the way through the book, I was just exhausted and ready to read something else. Nonetheless, due to her skills as a writer alone, I will probably try an earlier installation of this series."
3,More disturbing than usual,"I think I'm getting tired of Hamilton's vampire series, or I don't like the direction she's going. Famous for writing erotic stories (both the vampire and faerie series), this book veers off in a disturbing new direction that I really didn't like. I don't know how to mention it without giving away spoilers, but one scene towards the end really bothered me and turned me off of the whole book. The rest of the book was fine, as Anita travels to the Southwest to help out Edward. You'll get to see a whole new side of Edward, which is really cool, and it totally shocks even Anita. No Jean-Claude or Richard really in this book--it's mainly about Anita and Edward. After further disappointment with Narcissus in Chains, I think I'm going to leave Anita and join Meredith and the Faerie instead."
2,doesn't fit,"unlike most people who have reviewed this book, i did not like it. it doesn't fit the series and seems to throw everything off. i've read every book and if you skip this book and go to narcissis, the series will stay true. this one just wasn't impressive."
5,OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY (EDWARDS STORY),EACH BOOK IS BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE. THIS ONE IS GREAT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. LOVE HER BOOKS.
3,Getting Better,"This latest installment in the Anita Blake series has recaptured some of the feel, excitment, and enjoyment that has been lacking in previous books. The only slightly distracting item I have to complain about is that Hamilton is spending more time on the sexual tenshions in this one, and less time with plot needed detail. All in all not bad, but not quite what say the first 2 books were."
3,Anita strikes again,"Though I did enjoy the book, I was disappointed in that it was like going back to the begining of the series. I reminded me a lot of Guilty Pleasures. I would rather have seen some of the other issues brought up in past books resolved. I did enjoy learning more about Edward, though i disagree with those who thought he became ""warm"" and ""Cuddly"". I thought he was scarier, in a way, because the ""act"" had become so important. In other words, unless its an act, there's no one home."
4,Another winner....,"""Obsidian Butterfly"" was a great book in this series..but then..arent they all? This book focused on Edward. It was nice to FINALLY get to know him a bit better. There was a TON of action in this book that kept me glued to the story..my one complaint that took off a star is that as much as I needed a breather..I missed Jean Claude !!!! I also missed the wolves..especially Jason ..and of course the wereleopards..other than that.a definite must read."
1,Complete waste of time,"This is the first book by Laurell K. Hamilton that I have ever read. It is also the last I will ever read. Has this woman ever taken a writing class? A grammar lesson? Does she not have an editor? Those are the only reasons I can think of to explain the travesty that is this novel. With a strong editing hand, the book could have been cut by at least half and the story would have been just as strong. The long, rambling, nonsensical paragraphs that clog up the story bogged the momentum of the book down so badly that I had to grit my teeth to get through the entire thing. I do admit that I was intrigued by the premise of the book, and feel that the story was entertaining. However, the characters were poorly fleshed out or unbelievable, the descriptions were ridiculously detailed and irrelevant, and the general writing style was amatuerish. I'm absolutely shocked that this woman has sold enough books to have the words ""New York Times Bestseller"" on the front of this novel."
3,sometimes it works,"I'm an on-again, off-again fan of the Anita Blake novels. Sometimes the contents are just a little too bizarre, other times the plot and characters appeal. Lately the novels have been not so appealing. Angst over Jean Claude, who is manipulative; angst over Richard, the boy scout who can't get over his own monster-ness, blah, blah, blah.Although rather gory, ""Obsidian Butterfly"" is probably the best Anita Blake I've read since ""Guilty Pleasures"". The straight mystery/magic/horror was very well done, I thought. A little ""woe is me"" about AB's tendency toward violence, but not enough to side track the novel."
3,"Good, but why bother?","Good reading, typical Anita Blake stuff, but if Jean-Claude isnt' in it, why bother? And now that I'm not afraid of Edward anymore (who I used to love to fear), I'm afraid the author's going to make Jean-Claude into some type of touchy-feely wimp like Richard. There's not much better than Jean-Claude at his autocratic, domineering best and it seems as if she's getting away from that. Definitely going to have to read plenty of reviews on the next one before I buy it to see if she ruins any more of the characters."
4,Needs a few changes.,This game is very fun and the battle system is one of the best I've ever seen. Good graphics although you won't be amazed by the area you are in. It takes place in a dark and stormy castle that seems more like a dungeon. You don't know whether you are running in circles or your eyes are deceiving you because it seems like you run through the same place at least five times a minute. I would expect them to Squaresoft to know better than to start you in such a gloomy set. I think you should wait for Chrono Cross rather than getting this game.
3,Best Dungeon Crawler that i've played,If you want to know if this game is good or not without having to read paragraph upon paragraph just read this review. Bottem line is is that if you have some sort of Dungeon crawler fetish this is your thing. It's a dungeon crawler with heavy RPG elements and thats it. So if you like box puzzles (many many) and demons and such (many many). Not to mention that all you ever do is do the to of the above (no mini-games or diversion or nothing!) then this games for you (only one paragraph! ha:)
2,Worst Game,this game was a total dissapointment to me staying in the dungeon for the praticcaly the whole game was a eyesore if anyone thinking about buying this game don't. Also it is way to easy.
5,Jakes review,This game is a must have for any FF.VII/VIII player. it plays as good as either game but you only control one player. This allows more control over the player with a greater choice of actions and monsters. Amazing graphics and gameplay. A Must Have!
3,don't know if it works,"i'm a t2 diabetic... t2's are prone to heart problems, so i take these supplements under the assumption they might be helpful... i read the ingredient label...doesn't seem to be any questionable ingredient...imho... therefore, i take them... it's like being a member of all major religions...just as a precaution to cover one's bases...just in case there is a hereafter... lol..."
4,"Well-written, strong book","Shelley's story is emotional without being maudlin, funny without being silly, and serious without being dry. What you get from this book is a picture of a unique person who has a bunch of characteristics, including, but not only, Cerebral Palsy. I read it to try to understand what my daughter will go through as she grows up with Cerebral Palsy. Shelley is a strong and talented woman and the book reflects that. I hope my daughter grows up as well!"
2,Somewhat Lacking,"I bought this book hoping it would give me basic information on color mixing, brush technique and composition. It did not. The book has some beautiful examples of the author's art but gives very little information as to how he got there. It is not a step-by-step instruction book. Mr. Greer does not tell how to handle the acrylic medium as far as how to mix and apply the paint to get various results. If you are a beginning landscape painter looking for basic instruction in acrylic painting techniques, buy another book. If you have the basics down pretty well then this book may be for you. The author is a good landscape painter but not the greatest teacher."
2,router with plenty of challenges,"DI-624M is easy to install and provides good signal (at least within the range of my flat!). However, despite the fact that it is easy to install, it is a massive challenge to make it work efficiently afterward. It usually works okay for some time after installation and re-installation (which happens periodically), but after a while it tends to do its own thing (looks like this device has the mind of its own!). It connects to the internet, but prevents many programmes from accessing it altogether (with an exception of Skype, in my experience).Pros:1) easy to install2) good signalCons:1) settings change without any prior action and/or your intention2) settings change without any prior action and/or your intention3) did I mention that settings change by themselves???If you are considering purchasing a router, it would, probably, make sense to try getting some other product. This may prevent you from pain of trying to work out how to make DI-624M function properly."
3,A 5* Movie Deserves Better,"I'm not sure what they are doing when they slap together the entries for the Warner Archives Collection, but it is insulting to pay a premium price for something that I can watch on TCM and discover that the quality isn't any better.The print is old and dirty. There are no chapters. You can only move scenes in 10 minute increments. The sound quality is mediocre. For what it's worth, I might just as well DVR this movie straight off TCM and save myself money.All of this is a shame because NORA PRENTISS is one really good film. Ann Sheridan does what she does best.....sizzle intelligently and convincingly. Kent Smith delivers a great performance as a doctor making some ill-advised and life altering changes that lead him down a path to ultimate disaster. This film noir offering deserves a new audience, but not looking like someone had left it in a dust collecting cannister slowly rotting."
2,YES AND THEN .......!!!!!!!!,"i used it on my car and the scratches are GONE !!!!! i was happy but then , if you dare to wash youre car , the scratches will be back , like when you polish it you can hear the scratches telling you "" ILL BE BAAKK !!!"
1,No Win 2000 Drivers,"You cannot scan with the HP G55 if you are using Windows 2000; you have to keep checking the HP website for updates for when their beta version of the drivers will be ready (recently pushed back from mid-August to 31 August). And then only beta? Printing was difficult and even Uninstalling was impossible using 2000. I returned my G55, purchased a printer and HP flatbed scanner/copier/fax for a total of about $150 less than the G55 and am much happier."
4,Solid & Sturdy,Bought for the smaller size....was more solid and sturdier than expected. Perfect for compact areas and open decks. Needs a clean out
1,"""Inspiring"" should have been left out of the title!","I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this book or I'd have been even MORE disappointed! There were only a few projects presented, & in my estimation they were neither inspired nor inspiring."
4,a damn good cd,"i must say, i have a slightly biased opinion of music. im not really into this genre of music, so i didnt think id like this album that much. i was totally wrong. this is my first cave-in cd, and i liked it a lot. i can understand where some people think that they changed their sound to sell out, but a lot of bands change their sounds as they get older. Cave-In may have signed to RCA, which isnt that cool, but in my opinion, they still make good music. they put on an awesome live show, and theyre talented and nice guys. i definitely reccomend this album to anyone who likes good music."
3,definately not their best,"i had high hopes for this record...and at first listen i was highly disappointed (although after a few listens it does grow on you). its most similar to tides of tomorrow, but the material, at least in my oppinion, is not as good. i kinda get the feeling the major label people stuck their hands in things a little too much...their trademark eerie/spacey sound is much less pronounced on this record than previous efforts. the original versions of stained silver, rubber and glue (aka bigger riff), and lost in the air are much better if you ask me, and i think their single ""antenna"" is probably the worst track on the cd. cave in is one of my all-time favorite bands, and believe me, i wanted (and still want) for them to hit it off big...i just dont think this album represents their best work...every other release with the exception of beyond hypothermia (which gets a 3.5 to 4 rating in my book) is an absolute 5. antenna...its a 3."
3,3 and a half: a solid album,"To tell you the truth, i hadn't heard of cave-in until they had a single on the radio. But i liked it, so i gave it a try. I got it for 7 bucks at used music store. And with no knowledge of their previous ""space rock"" style, i thought of this as straight-forward hard rock, in the best sense. the electronics add a lot of depth (seafrost) while adding power house rock (stained silver) and catchy, if somewhat repetitive riffs (inspire). The drumming is tight, the basslines are interesting, and the vocals have feeling without being whiny, high-pitched, or emo-ish. (even though this album is slightly emo). I can't wait to see what they've done in the past. Great album."
5,"excellant book--good options, easy purchase","This book is an excellant history of the Milwaukee Railroad operations in Milwaukee, with many interesting and very good photographs. The book no longer is in print. Amazon.com provided a good summary of the book and its contents, an excellant offering of used and even some new editions of the book, including useful descriptions of the condition of the available editions, and an easy purchasing process."
4,Great Boys Night Out,"Rita's Playdates - Girls Night Out is a great boys night in. The girls are beautiful. The solo action is hot with lots of fingers, dildos, close-ups, and real orgasms. Rita's Playdates is higher quality than the Juicy Plum DVDs with beautiful women and great masturbation shots."
1,"Not instructional, not sexy- not worth buying","I ordered several CDs featuring female masturbation in an effort to school my long-time boyfriend. I thought this video would help because it featured female masturbation but was also a ""porn"" video of sorts...unfortunately I'm not even going to show it to him, because in the 15 minutes I scanned through I found it to be neither sexy nor helpful. These women- all of whom have seen better days- basically overact, rub their DD fake boobs, and ram various objects into themselves. Between the barb wire tattoos, oversized breasts and worn out privates, I can't understand how anyone else found this appealing- also, there's actually very little masturbation without the use of a sex toy, so it won't help my BF learn anything new. It normally turns me on to see other women touch themselves- after a short viewing of this I turned off the TV and started cleaning my house."
4,Comprehensive,I compared this book to every other travel book in the store and it by far had more information (500 pages of text). The format is easy to follow by region and it lists many of the smaller cities in each region. The maps offer are clear and the descriptions accurate. I've used this book to prepare for several trips to France (all in the outskirts of small towns) and have found it helpful each time.
1,what?,This regards the quality of the book itself... Several of the pages near the beginning were cut off at the ends -- the book had been bound poorly. It was a gift for my mother and we were very disappointed.
1,don't waste your time,"There are good books about the Amish. This is NOT one of them. Her books conflict each other with a love/hate relationship of theAmish. Also do not support ""amish"" books that photograph the amish. This is offensive to them and against their religion! Any book by Garret on the Amish is one to avoid."
4,Perfect for the job,"I have been using a hand made wooden boot jack and wanted another one for a different location.This boot jack is made of plastic material, but it has a good weight to it and doesn't slip around. It's easier on the heels of my leather boots and shoes as well and I now prefer it over the wood one."
2,Looks cool but breaks easlily,"My eleven year old son bought these after saving up his money and finding them on Amazon. When he got them I put them on his bike for him. They looked good and appeared to be something that would last, being that they had metal end caps and all. He had them for a couple of months but after his first fall the end cap broke off of one of them. It was broken and could not be put back on. I emailed the company and have yet to hear back from them. Unless you are someone who will never have a fall on your bike, I would not buy these grips. They are expensive and break easily."
5,Best grips I have owned,These grips are very easy to install and are very comfortable. The clamps are well made and hold very well. The grip material seems to be just soft enough while not being too squishy. I will definitely be buying these again when I need new grips.
2,Thule 724 rack,"I recently just purchased this rack to haul at least 2 snowboards. In the description it states that 2 boards will fit. Well to my dismay, I found that only 1 board will fit. I am a big Thule fan and have bought a roof rack and accessories to haul my bikes plus kayak. To me, this carrier is not up to the traditional Thule quality. I feel that it could have been made better and larger to fit what the description calls for."
3,Nice and light,"This is a nice ""okay"" fragrance. It's only draw back is that it doesn't have staying power unless you use a lot. Cologne shouldn't arrive before you do - but I like to know that it's there.I smelled the cologne on a co-worker who is from Sierra Leone. Oddly enough, it was because he sprayed a tad too much - which is how I came to notice it. Now I understand why he over did it a bit.As a side note; this same guy told me something interesting. This fragrance is by a French designer. My co-worker told me that once a cologne/parfum crosses an ocean, it changes it's scent. He said that it is a known mystery. Can anyone validate this?"
5,Good Read,"Interesting book, easy to read, and written from the POV of someone middle aged with middle aged views. Also, takes place during modern times, instead of 30 years ago... I enjoyed the book and it's got the vagabond raging within my soul!"
3,Too Much Time On My Hands,"The book could have been compressed to half the size without a loss of interest. The author spends a great deal of time discussing the relationships among he and his co-travelers on this hemispheric trip. He laments the fact he is viewed as a weak link in the trio, yet his actions do nothing to supply the reader reasoning for any other view of his role. He also spends more than enough time on discussing the various women he beds on the trip. A good view of an ugly American on an extended vacation. Somehow the author secured a contract prior to his trip and I am sure that this is one reason the title was published. The book is redeemed, in some fashion, with a good discussion of the materials one needs for making such a trip and the various mechanical issues that will face a motorcyclist on the roads of the Americas."
2,Where was this guys editor?!,"Yea it may contain some interesting anecdotal information but, yikes, what a chore to read. This guy must have failed his freshman writing course! Gross gramatical mistakes, misused words (the author must not own a dictionary), unused words (I don't think this guy knows more than 10,000 english words and they are all in this book multiple times), run cover to cover. My ten year old can tell a better story than this with content that would seem not nearly as exciting. Buy it if you must, but be prepared to dumb down while you sift for the usefull stuff."
3,"ok book, not the best, not the worst",this book was good because i had nothing else to read and it kept me somewhat entertained. i've read worse. they were cute characters until three quarters of the way through the book but then Shelby seemed childish and Geoff was disgustingly sweet. i'm glad i read it and i will probably read more by Ms. Wright.
4,TmNT,A family film. The kids will enjoy it. A new story of the four artist-named ninja turtles. The graphics are fine. A good lesson in family sticking together when the going gets rough.
3,Rent It,They just rode the wave of a cool franchise but the movie is pretty bad. The visuals are pretty cool but eh!
2,Very Poor Video Quality,Bought this movie for the kids and could not believe how poor the picture quality was. Renting was available in two formats; HD and SD. The only option for purchasing was SD. I have seen VHS tapes with better quality video. Did I mention the video quality was bad?
5,cowabanga dude,hehehe i have always loved the turtles :D and this movie delivers great turtle action and fun i havent had since the original first Live Acion movie.the grafics are greatthe general flow of the movie is greatthe character developments are fineand the turtles rule :D
4,A Return to Form,"I used to read the comic book ""back in the day,"" watched the animated TV show and even the movies. Yes, the horrible live-action movies. My expectations were low when this movie came out so I didn't see it in a theater. After renting it from Amazon, I now regret that I missed seeing it on the big screen.The animation is top notch and the voice acting is decent. What surprised me the most was the story. Unlike the live-action films, it wasn't loaded up with lame surfer jokes and slapstick. The story stayed true to the comic and captured the essence of what makes TMNT fun.I highly recommend seeing this film."
4,A Tale of Faith Well Written,"Diana Butler Bass has done a wonderful job of describing her faith journey. It is witty, intelligently written, well documented, and compelling. It probably helps to be an Episcopalian to enjoy it and to see one's self in parts of the book. Bass is a churchgoer. Always has been. Always will be. I understand where she is coming from. However, her education and experience at eight different parish churches from Massachusetts to California makes very entertaining reading as well as giving the reader much to reflect on and ponder. There is nothing flip about this book. It is serious stuff and it is also uplifting. Her path in the church does not mirror mine, but that just makes the twists and turns in her faith life more interesting. It also explains why the Episcopal Church can be so frustrating to many and misunderstood by others. It is a journey worth reading about and who knows, you may find strength for yours there also."
3,"Nice , unscented","nice unscented wipes, but to get one i have to open the entire box, cause they stuck, i had them before and those were fine , not going to take chances - will get something else next time."
1,Just doesn't work...even one inch separating the two keypad,"Buying these locators is just like throwing money out of the window...they just don't work! I keep pushing the button when the locator is one inch away from the other and it's only after pushing dozen of times that the other starts to ring...worthless...also when they are one feet away, no matter how many times I push, the other doesn't answer..."
2,"NICE IDEA, POOR EXECUTION","This product seemed like a great idea. A multi-way remote allowing you to find any of the objects tagged with a key chain from any other item similarly tagged. Key chains are larger than I would like, but not unweildy. The problem I had was that the alarm buttons would constantly reset themselves and not function properly. Maybe I just got unlucky and had a defective one, but with that issue and the large size, I opted to get a refund and not replace them."
3,Not what I hoped for,"I agree with the first reviewer. I purchased this kit for my 10 year old son, who is above average intelligence and has a voracious appetite for scientific knowledge and experiments. He is fascinated by the kit, but the instruction book is so poorly written that he cannot even begin to make sense of it. I am taking the other reviewers advice and purchasing some other basic electronics books in hopes of salvaging the [money] spent on the kit."
3,Read this as I was fighting EDNOS,"Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful to see a Christian view on femininity and the body. I just don't think she took it far enough. She presented a lot of wonderful information, but there never was a conclusion. So for me, it was, ""Now that I know this, what do I do with it?"". A good book, but not a great book. A sequel would be amazing. The author has a great heart and good intentions, but runs out at then end when it comes time to do something about it."
1,misleading plot summary,I just want to warn buyers that the plot summary on this is completely wrong. This video has nothing to do with Edgar Allan Poe.
4,Luciano Pavarotti - In Concert in China,"Most satisfactory. It would make a nice addition to any Pavarotti collection, and I would recommend it to all of the Maestro's admirers"
4,I love it,I am a 2.5/3.0 level person and loved the way this racquet acts. It was delivered on time and is exactly what you expected. I love it!
4,Teaching and Island living,"This dvd will inspire and excite you! It is full of energy and passion. You will want to lobby against huge schools and bureaucracy and will long for the one room school house. That said, the original John Voight version ""Conrack"" is preferable and more realistic (no hills depicted as the setting is South Carolina's lowcountry). Also many of the families who still live on Daufuskie are not pleased with Pat Conroy's portrayal of them which magnifies himself to their detriment. Fortunately, the true setting Mary Fields School is still used regularly for church summer camps, town meetings, and even birthday parties. The families still are able to live on Daufuskie Island and maintain much of the culture depicted in the dvd. Most of all, Daufuskie still has a marvelous school serving 16 children ages 4 through 11. And yes, the teachers are passionate and the students thrive!"
2,Inexpensive and cracks all the time,"I can't tell you how many of these slim jewel cases have cracked- very annoying. Very poor quality. I don't know what it is with the ones that come with the blank CDR's either. The slim cases I got with audio CD's in the past(mainly import CD singles) have had no problems, with much use. But these 3M's and the ones that come with most blank CDR's are horrible. I'd stick to normal jewel cases or buy a binder, unless you don't mind the ease in which these crack."
1,swim fishy swim,Very well written with beautiful photographs and helpful illustrations. This nonfiction book is the perfect length for younger elementary students. My 3rd grade class enjoyed the book and became interested in the project. We wrote the school and they were very good about answering emails.
2,Not as Pictured,"The colors of this gnome don't match what is shown online. His skin is tinted a greyish green, making him very ugly. I was hoping for the cute little gnome pictured, but instead it is poorly painted (colors bleeding over their intended area) and has a hue that makes him look sick. Disappointed in my ugly little gnome."
1,Ugly Gnome,"The gnome was for my daughter's birthday. I didn't open the box until the day of her party because I originally wanted to wrap it, but then I thought I would put the gnome on her birthday cake. When I saw the gnome I was greatly disappointed! He had an ugly green face, hands, and the center of the daisies were green as well! Even his beard had green in it. He did not look anything like the picture on the box or the advertisement. At that point, I didn't have time to return it, so I quickly repainted the gnome so that I could still give it to my daughter on her birthday."
5,A cheery little pal,"Ever since I saw the Foreign Film, Amelie, I have been in love with garden gnomes. I would love to have one in my yard, but since I live in an apartment, I can't. This is the perfect trade off! It is small enough to fit in a suitcase (or pocket) and fun to have in photos. It is a silly little thing but always makes me smile."
5,One of my all time favorites,"The fact that it is told, mainly, from the perspective of those using this young man, who is looking for love and understanding after the death of his mother, makes every act of cruelty (the emotional even more so that the physical) stab at your heart so much more.Dennis Cooper manages to infuse hope, love and compassion in with the loss, cruelty and sex. Making this a really brilliant work.If you have a heart, read this book!I think a lot of readers get it wrong when they say that Cooper's work is sado-homo-erotic. It's too human and emotional for such a narrow definition.Dennis Cooper and his works are a perfect example of why I love to be a reader and wish I was a more eloquent reviewer."
5,Great low luster auto interior protectant,"I can't stand shiny, greasy looking plastic /vinyl interior pieces (dashboard, doorpanels, etc. When I tried this product i knew I'd found the one I'd been looking for - a product that leaves a very rich low luster finish. Just spray on an applicator pad, apply to surface, let sit for a minute or so, & wipe off any extra with a micro towel. Use with Meguiar's Quik Interior Detailer Cleaner for a really fine and inexpensive interior detailing duo."
2,What year was this made?,"The liner notes for this CD give a copyright date of 1991 - but you'll swear you're back in the easy-listening 70's while listening to this instrumental blend of guitar, violin, and lots and lots of synthesizer! Actually, I guess if those synths are really good, maybe the whole thing was synthesized!The performers listed in the credits are Stephan Marston and Sheridan Wolf Eldridge, not Thomas Chase and Steve Rucker, who are actually the album's producers.You can learn a lot from reading liner notes - for example, did you know that ""The Beatles experienced one of the most riveting careers in the annals of show business?"" How about that albums like Abbey Road ""forever changed the course of rock 'n' roll""? Oh, yeah, you probably did."
3,"Overall, I liked it.","The premise of Meredith's revenge was intriguing and unlike other Diana Palmer books. I found her character strong, smart and entirely too forgiving of Cy and his mother, Myrna. The boardroom scenes were great even though the plot did drag quite a bit at times. The only real fly in the ointment was that oaf of a hero, Cy Harden. What a sexist pig! He insults Meredith at every turn and yet she practically pants whenever he touches her. I couldn't figure out why someone like her would want him. He was definitely beneath her. In fact, my mind kept wandering to her late husband, Henry Tennison. Too bad he died. Even the bodyguard, Mr. Smith, had lots of promise. Both of these characters were more manly than the juvenile Cy Harden. I guess Diana Palmer likes her heroes flawed. This man certainly was. I have a hard time picturing a truly happily ever after for this couple."
4,True Color,"I almost did not buy this book owing to some of the reviews. Thankfully, I did buy it and finished it in one day.... I loved it. I normally enjoy DP books and this was no exception.... I would recommend it as it definately kept me on the edge of the seat."
4,A retro hyperboost to video game heaven,"As a typical 70s and 80s kid, I played all these games, and framed some of my most basic childhood memories around where my friends and I played them. Of course I bought this album, and was thoroughly entranced. Assuming you fit this demographic, this product might be a great blast from the past, or could prove impossibly corny. Perhaps the very fact that I remember Pac Man Fever all these years later is its best testimonial. Enjoy!!"
2,"Hiya, kids!","I had this album back in 1982. After Buckner & Garcia had a hit with their novelty song ""Pac-Man Fever"", they recorded an entire album of novelty songs about video games. The songs were silly, of course, but mostly enjoyable (to my teenage brain, at least). This CD features re-recorded versions of all the songs on the album. I can't tell you how close these versions are to the original versions, since I haven't heard the original album in over 20 years. But if you want the Pac-Man Fever album on CD, I guess this is better than nothing."
5,Pac Man Fever kicks butt!!!!,I loved this album. The songs brings back such good memories of the glory days of the 1980s. I was 6 years old when this song came out and instantly was struck down by Pac Man Fever. I remember the days when people pumped quarters with a room full of Pac Man Video games. Every kid got their first exposure on arcade games by playing the Pac Man video game. I enjoyed Pac Man in the arcade and on my Atari video game set. I strongly urge you to buy this album if you want to live the cheesy but great 1980s.
2,* some tracks re-recorded to ensure highest qwality possible,"I recently hit the buckner and garcia website and sampled the CD before I made a purchase. And I have to agree with the other reviewer of this CD, it's a nice gesture by the artists, but it doesn't compare with the original album (and single) from 1982. I STRONGLY suggest writing CBS records to have the original re-released if you love this album. Otherwise try a search on other various artists compilation CDs, the P-M-F single is out on CD, if you look hard enough."
1,BORING & RIDICULOUS,"I found the book hard to finish. The characters were shallow. I didn't like the heroine at all, even the hero wasn't that likeable nor were his actions. The book dragged out for me. I usually like the author, but this one was not good. Some of the plot was even unbelievable. Don't waste your time."
5,"A rare thing, a genuine comic novel","If you know anything about the recovery movement, you know that in addition to being helpful to millions, it can also be saccherine, irritating, and humorless. So can most churches, so that's not a condemnation. But what if the humanity and sweetness of the movement could be captured along with a huge dose of laughter at this lumbering, self absorbed thing? You would have a really special book. Written as a series of daily affirmations, the book reminds us of Richardson's PAMELA (a very early English novel in the form of a series of letters home). In this straitjacket of a form, characters develop, personality is revealed, and we laugh at and with the Recovery world without one jot of cruelty to people's pain or their struggles. This is one of the funniest and best comic novels since Auntie Mame. So raise a non-alcoholic glass to salute Stuart Smalley, who is a little bit of a hero after all."
5,Intimate view of the Scotch-Irish coming to America.,The book interested me initially because it was about McClures written by a McClure. I was quite amazed at how closely it resembled my own McClure family's saga. I would very much like to discuss it with the author if she reads these reviews.
3,not all that thrilling indeed,"I can't say I'm disapointed in this cd because my expectations were low, but I'm sorry I bought it. Thats not to say its a bad cd, but it is more than a little boring. There isn't anything on here that we haven't seen done better by AE (though admittedly more mechanically and clinicaly). I can see why people might like it, but I have a large enough variety of electronic stuff that this doesn't make much of an impression on me. If you enjoy laid back AEish kind of sounds, I STRONGLY suggest you run out and buy Phonem's Hydro Electric. you can get it at www.bentcrayon.com"
5,When is book Four? I WANT MORE!!!!!!!,"Redemption is incredible. The writing is gorgeous and the characters are complicated and ""real."" Dhamon is my favorite Dragonlance character. I like his draconian pal, too.The book moves along quickly, and it puts the characters in a bunch of frightening situations. I liked how it went from one area of Krynn to another -- lots of traveling. I also liked all the surprises. I figured by the name ""Redemption,"" that the book would turn out all happy. But it didn't turn out the way I thought it would. Blew me away!I want there to be a book four and a book five and a book six."
1,"This is not the product of our childhood, it is the product of our nightmares!","Remember that time in the late 1980's when Coca Cola created a new version, and no one liked it, so then they created Coca Cola Classic? That is when Coca Cola changed forever. The original Coke was made with real sugar. The Coca Cola Classic they replaced it with a year later was made with High Fructose Corn Syrup. High Fructose Corn Syrup is linked to cancer, IBS, and it is laced with Mercury. This product is poison in a bottle, it destroys intestinal flora and degrades human health."
1,didn't healmy canker sore,"I had this crazy third uncle who said Dr. Pepper had medical properties. ""why do you think it's gor Dr. in it's name son?"" he used to say. But his sane wife used to say under her breath when he made his out of left field claims, ok out of Pluto claims, ""coke DOES take care of canker sores"". Well I finally got me one of those blomming beauties and arlanta's finest product did NOTHING for it. Oh well, may the good Dr. P will do the trick."
3,"Omnipage Pro is Great, Pagekeeper Pro a bust","Out of the box, the OCR software works great with my HP 4C Scanner. Even fax pages are done very well. Nice facility for changing the words that the OCR software does not recognize. Also nice feature to ""train"" the OCR to recognize more. Pretty fast too, although this would depend on your scanner and PC. I am getting about 15 seconds a page with a Pentium II 550, 128MB memory with Windows NT 4.0. Pagekeeper Pro to manage the scanned paper images does not work correctly and the caere.com support web site is apparently dead now so I could not see if I was doing something wrong, an install error or if there was a fix for the problem. So some of the nice features you see in the sales literature do not work. A bust for me there."
2,Program shut-down and other frustrations,"I used the Omnipro 10 and found it often shut-down in the middle of performing OCR and wouldn't keep the zones in a templet I had saved to read the same documents and capture specific bits of data. Otherwise the toolbars are well thought-out and the windows easy to move around. The help could be a little more extensive most times I found I had to go to the website for any help beyond the obvious, ""Is your scanner turned on?"". For document and data capture I recommend looking around first."
1,"Grey, Not White; Shards, Not Bowls","These bowls are tinged grey. (I have some white Ten Strawberry Street china that I like a lot; I had hoped that the bowls would be the same color. Too bad for me.)The inner boxes were open, and just sort-of ""flung in"" to the outer delivery box. No surprise that one of the two inner boxes was full of shards. Target wants me to bring them to the store (and stand in line) or return them by mail, apparently at my own expense.Bottom line: don't buy fragile stuff from Target, and don't buy these bowls if you want to use them with stuff that is actually white.Edit, added the next day: Amazon has handled the return process in a hassle-free way, so I don't have to use Target's mechanism. Thank you, Amazon!"
4,Rotring not what is used to be,The pen broke after about a year. I had one like it before. It broke also. The internal mechanism is flawed. Probably why it isn't made anymore
1,"""0 STARS"" WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE","Pizzimenti's whining, along with his total inability to write in complete sentences, grows tiresome by page 10. Save your money and save three hours of your life (hours I'll never get back) by not buying or reading this book. Where's the epilogue that talks about how the author got out of the Air Force early and turned his free education and on-the-job training into a high paying job in the computer industry? Maybe I missed that part while I was writing out my student loan check."
3,She's written better,I GOT FRUSTRATED WITH jOSIE IN THIS BOOK BUT IT WAS WORTH READING TO THE END. I LOVE SUZANNE BROCKMAN'S SEAL BOOKS AND THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER THAN THIS ONE. I CAN'T IMAGINE A REAL LIFE COOPER WHO WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH JOSIE AS LONG AS HE DID.
1,$40 for a CD ?????????,I love Michael Ball but I would never spend that much $$ for a CD even for him. I find it incredulous that any CD would be so expensive. So I guess I will never own it or even hear the songs. Maybe I can find it on ebay---I will go look. I am very disappointed that the price is out of my range. I am giving this CD a low rating due to price.
3,not a full bottle,this is third time I have sent this but the product came with about 1oz leak out in box. never got any reponce from amazon about this even though I have written twice about it.
2,"Started strong, but quickly failed","At first, everything works. Then one of the extremely thin keys starts to stick... then another. You unstick them but now they aren't on the same level as the other keys. Then the mouse starts to go non-responsive -- first the motion is erratic, then the pointer starts to periodically jump around on its own. Finally the mouse clicks become unreliable: sometimes registering as a double-click, sometimes not at all.I got just over 3 months' use out of this product before it became completely unusable."
3,Great product when it worked.,This was truly a great product for the price when it worked. I used from a range of around 15ft and everything worked just fine. The keyboard had super sensitive keys that were very easy to type with. And the mouse seemed to be of good quality and worked at a long range of over 10 ft with ease. Sad thing is this unit only lasted for around a month and a half before it started not functioning properly. Also the keyboard's keys are very thin and jam very easily.
2,Life in a Cold Climate,"A biography? Not really, she compares Nancy Mitford's life with those of Nancy's fictional characters. Often boring, when she does write about Nancy, its very good. Too much symbolism in this book.She assumes we read all of the Mitford books.Disappointing for true bio readers."
2,rip off,i ordered this watch on here for my boy friend then later found it at tillys in the mall for $30 cheaper. the face of the watch LOOKS pretty big but its about average size if not smaller.
2,"Brief, forgettable, and amateurish...","Rochelle Alers's first novel ""Careless Whispers"" tries to be a different romance, but the story bored me to tears, but luckily it was only 186 pages. Dyana, the magazine writer heroine, starts to fall hard for a maverick Pulitizer-prize winning photographer after someone rams their car in an accident. Dyana starts to see Nicholas(the photographer) in a new light. Then they work together on a ""tell-all"" book from a convicted spy, and naturally, they're smitten with each other and marry. But both have heavy baggage from exes that cheated on them. Will they repeat the same mistakes? Or will they learn to trust each other completely. Only merits 2 stars."
1,Tuning ~old~ Rover Engines,would have been a better title.Written in 1994 and never updated. This book was a total waste of money for me.I have a post 94 Rover engine block as the foundation to a built 4.0 Sadly that block doesn't exist in this world. That should have been my first clue...I was looking to do a conversion from the usual Edelbrock/Holley to GEMS based FI. The section on FI predates GEMS.Not even useful as a paperweight.
4,The final chapter of a classic tv series,"As a child, I was always drawn to The Night Gallery because of its dark humor, macabre story lines and guest stars. The coming attraction was matched by the crispness of the episodes and wonderful camera work. Each had its appeal and lasting effect on me as a horror fan. I am thrilled that they are finally releasing the last season of this series. I cannot wait."
5,Finally,"I proudly have all three seasons on dvd. While yes, a few episodes were lacking, others were superb. Take for instance ""The Other Way Out"". Who of us would wanted to have been in Ross Martin's place when he realized that he was trapped in a cellar beyond all help. Or Mickey Rooney similarily trapped amongst the famous and infamous in ""Collector's Items"". To Mr. Serling, a fond thanks."
5,The Ring with the Red velvet Ropes,Season three is worth buying for one and I think the best episode of all theseasons of night gallery THE RING WITH THE RED VELVET ROPES.
3,...and now completed!,"No matter,the Night Gallery wasn't Twilight Zone.The Stories are not so bad and the guest-stars are famous.The third season is good as well.The bonus DVD with unreleased Episodes are for die-hard-night-gallery-fans!One fulltime episode & the other ones are Night Gallery - scetches.I think,those funny scetches in the Night Gallery didn't work.On the other side you've got the serious introducing by Rod Serling with the thrillin'stories - and then these unserious jokes.Whatever,its a must have for Rod Serling-fans!!!"
1,Piece of junk.,Worthless piece of junk. Really. I tried it but saw no redeeming qualities. really awkward to use. Not a good product.
4,Touching in many ways!,"I couldn't decide if I should give this three stars or four. I decided on four because the story is very touching and the little girl is a show stealer! The reason I would have rated it lower was because the mother (who was so enjoyable in ""the Greatest Love"") played the role a bit too weak for my taste. I think she is trying to portray a very nice person but she came off as being a doormat for anyone to step on. However, that said, overall the characters were engaging. I especially fell in love with grandpa and the little girl! Well worth watching!"
3,The King of ZZZZZZZZZZ Movies maybe!!!!!!!!,"What a let down,yes I have seen worse movies than this one,but not with so many people talking about this guy being ""The King of Gore"" on those worse movies.Which I waited the whole movie to see,maybe the guy's who gave this movie 5 stars,were thinking only about the hooters in the movie,because I didn't see anything to give this movie anything above a 3,and should of gave it a 2.But I am feeling nice today,but if you like gore,this movie is not for you,if you like really bad acting(and I know B-Movies are known for bad acting,but these are below that)this is for you,they must of spent a year in how not to act school.Plus the really bad special effects,which were not cute nor funny.So be warned,don't be dumb or stupid and shell out any money for this(like me),well none more than a penny,and even that's a rip,because you have to pay $2.98 shipping.And I can understand people giving this a 1 star."
2,Could have been much better.,"When I first purchased the game, I had mixed feelings about it. There was no way that it could measure up to Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. But if they were good, this one is too, right?Wrong. The first day I had it, I was already bored. What makes the game even more aggravating is that you have to get all 242 stars to beat it. You also have to beat all the bosses twice (or more). I still wonder why I bought the game.The music and levels are beautiful, but sadly it doesn't contribute to the fun of the game. If it weren't for them, I would give it one star. This would be a wonderful game to rent, but don't buy it. If you want a good Mario game, buy Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Sunshine."
2,Boring and Repetitive.....,"After reading all of the great reviews, I figured I would rent it. But I then found out within the first 10 minutes that alot of it is video watching and playing boring missions (i.e. Playing Hide and Seek with a rabbit). The storyline is pretty much the same as any other Mario game. So overall, Id stick with New Super Mario Bros instead of this."
2,Way too easy and boring,"I agree with most people that the tutorials are long and boring and this game is sooo easy it's super boring. I'm returning it, It might be good for children under the age of ten."
2,Juvenile,"I""m really having a hard time getting into this game, maybe it's not for a 62 year old man who has lost all patience."
5,Galaxy is Great,"This game is cool. I thought at first it would stink since it is only one player, but player two can assist the other player which is great if you are someone who hates to wait for their turn. It has great graphics and the kids all loved it, and the adults too."
5,awesome!!!!,got this item lightning fast... gave it to my niece for christmas and now shes enjoying it everytime she plays...
5,Best Wii Game I've Played!,"I have to say that this is the best Wii game I've played yet! The storyline isn't necessarily all that novel or interesting (and it's a bit childish at times) but the gameplay is awesome. The controls are relatively easy to pick up, especially if you've played past Mario games (like Mario 64). It's not incredibly difficult, but some of the levels and bosses do provide a challenge. The large numbers of worlds and levels will keep you playing for a while, as well as the need to return to past levels to collect ""star bits"". The best feature is the clever use of ""gravity"" that allows you to walk all the way around spherical ""planets""...it's a great twist on a classic game."
5,Super Fun,Love the new take on Super Mario! It is actually one of the best games for the Wii in my opinion and is great FUN for ALL AGES!
5,Great game but a tad challening...,"We love this game expect it is a tad challenging for my 7 year old. He likes to play but is easily frustrated by the finesse you need to have to move Mario around the different obstacles, pick up items, etc. I know once we have some more Wii practice he will love this game."
2,Disappointing,"Mario has lost his way since the days of the 8 bit nintendo. While Super Mario Galaxy is an improvement from Sunshine, I think that Mario 64 is better than Galaxy. The best of the Super Mario series of course being 1 and 2.I found the orientation of Galaxy to be disorienting and uncomfortable. As Mario, you move from planet to planet as levels. The object typically being to find and collect the Super Star. Each planet is like a ball that you run around on, but the camera does not change perspective. [..]Graphically, this game looks good for a Wii game, though only somewhat better than what you would expect from a Gamecube. The music scores are orchestrated, but uninspired. The music from the old 2D Mario games were much more spirited."
1,This game isn't fun at all,The game doesn't have a good plot and the game is very hard to know what to do in. In my opinion this is the worst game I have ever played
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!,"I have yet to write a review for a video game, but this warrants a review. This has to be the best $50 I ever spent on a video game (or on anything for that matter). For starters, this game is never ending. We got it for my 6 yo for Christmas and I have yet to complete it (and the 6yo) is even further behind. Not only is it long it is very exciting and engaging and you are always playing to see what is in the next levelI will be disappointed when I actually finish the game"
3,Not Satisfied,Not happy as we purchased a Wii game that was said to be Like new and when we received the game it would not work in our Wii system. There were many scratches on the game.
5,great game for all ages,I have three children plus nieces and nephews ranging from 2 to 22 and they all love this game. It is easy enough my 4 year old can play and I like it too which I don't like very many and they have ruined the new spyro games by making them too complicated but this game has true staying power. I own about 30 wii games and they play this one the most.
5,Depression experts provide easy to read and use book!,"I have read this clear, practical book from cover to cover. Having been a physician for 22 years, and a psychiatrist for most of that, I have seen a multitude of books, both expert and popular, on mental health.""Beating Depression"" is in a class by itself.First, the writers have a collective wealth of clinical, academic and research experience that informs their work. Content is current and authoritative. Second, ""Beating Depression"" is very clear and easy to read. It is well-organized and practical, --and obviously designed to help people and their families get the care they need for depression. I use it, and highly recommend it to friends, colleagues, and patients."
1,Poorly Shipped Product Makes a Mess,"Always order this by itself. Do not have other items shipped with it.While I'm sure that this makes proper chili, whoever packages it for shipment has done a very poor job. When I received my packages, chili dust was everywhere inside. The packets were stored together in an extremely flimsy paper bag. I'm not usually too picky about how my things are shipped, but I expect to not have the remains of an exploded pack all over the packs and my other purchases."
2,Underwhelmed,"This product is easy to use and convenient, but the final product does not taste like Skyline if that's your goal."
5,Great product,"If you like Cincinnati chili you'll love this mix. So much easier for making 5 way then measuning the 20 or so individual spices, not to mention having to keep them in stock."
5,best chilii,There aren't chili parlors in Ohio for nothing. This is great stuff and I have given the packets away to all friends and family.
3,Sorta fun but the lack of dialouge really takes away from the experience,the lack of any and all dialogue and instructions really take away from the experience since so much of what makes star wars great is the story which is hard to really follow with out the characters talking So really if you have watched the movies then you will recognise what is going on but still not as fun as it would be.
1,It was good until I hit the freezing bug,"This game is a blast. However (and this is a big however), the game crashes at the same point every time you try to play through Return of the Jedi's super story mode. In other words, it's nearly impossible to get 100% complete the game without massive frustration. Supposedly, there are certain ways to play around the bug, but I've tried this level four times (wasting about an hour each time) only to have my Xbox 360 crash whenever I get to the creek in the Battle of Endor level. I'll continue trying because I'm a completist, but failure to properly playtest a game is inexcuseable.Unfortunately, LucasArts has shown no interest in fixing this flaw, which is absurd. If you buy this game, I'd recommend buying it used so that you don't reward them for putting out a game that obviously wasn't thoroughly playtested."
1,Angry book written by angry woman,This book was an angry rant about everything to do with pregnancy. Coverage was not especially good. I loved What to Expect When You Are Expecting; that had much better coverage of info and was written in a much nicer manner.
1,I was very unimpressed with this book,"I hate to complain after seeing all the positive reviews but I was really unimpressed with this book, some of the daily tips are funny but I have seen other books since buying this one that I wish I would have bought instead, I would recommend looking around before making a decision on a book such as a pregnancy diary because you only get one chance to get a nice book."
5,Get this book back in Print!,The perfect book to understand art critique and the way it is explained is wonderful. I wish I could find the Teacher's Edition
3,Giant step backwards,Audio inconsistant because of DSP making adjustments. Never as clear as Plantronics 510. Returned 665.Neither usable in 18 wheeler. Sound bad in high noise.Nokia BH 900 usable in 18 wheeler.
2,Alright,I normally love all the Olsons movies as they are always adventurous and creative.I thought this one would be the best as it was filmed and acted where i live which is Sydney.But to tell you the truth this was the worst one ive seen yet as its confusing in i thinking its not making to much scence.I was very disapointed about this as it was there first in Australia.If this review is helping anyone at all don't let it put you down try it and if you like it there is a MUST for the rest of there movies.

4,a risky adventure,"you get a mix of ""gangs"", but in a good way and some stealing, but the boys are cute and everything works out in the end"

5,famous writer tells vivid stories of his travel adventures,"Anastasia Little, a native of Denmark, has trans-lated for the first time Andersen's accounts of his travels in Europe and the Mediterranean, meeting a fascinating and colorful cast of characters under circumstanceds which seem like another world to a reader today. a book full of unexpected oddities and beautiful descriptions which gives us Andersen in a new role as a social historian of arevolutionary epoch as Europe entered the industrial age and life began to change at a much more rapid pace. But all this is coincidental to the sheer enjoyment of discovering Andersden himself as a person telling a different kind of story, or rather many stories of a world that was his own reality."
3,takes up all ports on my laptop,"I was to understand from the product description and other reviews that this hard drive had an ac adapter that plugged inot the wall but it only has one that plugs into the usb 2.0 port or the ps2 (mouse) port. Well my laptop doesn't have a ps2 port so I have to plug into my usb port and the actual usb for the drive is in the other port and I only have 2! I have a 4 port bus but it doesn't supply enough power for the drive so i have to use both of my ports for this one device which is very frustrating. Other than that, it seems to be a decent drive. So if you only have 2 usb 2.0 ports like me, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,"drive sucks, service sucks","I bought two of these (100GB version). They both failed. I sent them in under warrantee. They were returned to me ""reconditioned"" - and still with the same problem. I wrote back to customer service and they ignored my emails."
2,Only worked for a certain amount of time,This is my second Lacie Mobile Drive and I am having the same problem that I had with my first one after using it for about a year. Since its so small its great for travel but the problem i'm having now is my computer is not detaching it.I'm sure this is because the there is something wrong with the power wire. The LED light comes on as if it was working but my computer and my other computer is not detaching it.I'm going to try to look up info on the net for help and call them tomorrow because I really need my data.
3,"Some Good Tips, But Too Young For My Kids","I really enjoyed listening to Scott Flansburg in person and thought that this book would have some helpful tips for my kids, but this is really directed at first to fourth graders. If you have kids of that age, this might work for you."
4,Feel Good Fun...,"I decided to purchase this DVD after having read some of the reviews regarding this title. In all honesty, I was prepared to be disappointed, but It's In The Water is the most pleasantly surprising film that I have watched in a very long time. Despite the rather absurd premise regarding the hazards of the town's drinking water, the writing is funny and clever in the way it illustrates the narrow-minded atmosphere of a small Texas town. The acting is somewhat forced and at times falls flat, but the characters are well developed, albeit more than a little stereotypical. The key to enjoying this film is to recognize it for what it truly is: a satire that pokes fun at heterosexual perceptions regarding gays and lesbians but also at the way gays and lesbians see themselves. Don't take it too seriously. You'll only spoil the fun."
4,Trying to rent a funny lesbian flick? Pick this first,"Chances are, by the time you're considering watching ""It's in the Water"", you've seen a lesbian-themed movie or two. So if you think you're running out of options because you've seen ""Gia"" and ""Better than Chocolate"" or what have you, feel free to dive right in to this.""It's in the Water"" is worth renting because it's fun. The first few minutes may have you wondering what you've spent your money on, but don't worry. It gets hilarious. The humor is fresh and the chemistry between the lead characters is genuine. And for some reason, that blonde just looks better and better with every scene.Bottom LineCuddles: ***Tissues:Hotness: ***Laughs: ****Quality: ***Rent it first. Buy after you don't return it because you can't quit watching it."
4,Pokes fun at bigotry,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film even though the acting is overdone in spots, probably to reflect how ridiculous anti-gay bigotry can be. Keri Jo Chapman and Teresa Garrett are both hot and very believable as a couple. Teresa Garrett's (Grace) final line in the film is definitiely worth watching the whole movie for."
4,It's In The Water,"""It's In The Water"" is a light-hearted, romantic comedy that showcases a small southern community with its expectations of behavior grappling with a new Hospice Center that serves AIDS patients. The movie, in outlandish ways exemplifies ignorance around AIDS. That one of the community's most notable families unexpectedly comes face to face with one of its members who falls in love with another womyn, a former community member who is a nurse at the Hospice. In both heart-warming and heart-breaking ways this movie shows the indomitable human right of love and dignity.I personally enjoyed this movie a great deal even though some of the acting seemed a bit stilted. Overall, the movie is funny and loving enough that I watch it over and over. For I have decided I'd rather watch a slightly stilted movie that makes me feel good than a dark, depressing one. For me, anytime love prevails that equals a WIN!"
3,Entertaining and Funny,This movie made me laugh. Small town people believing in a rumor is funny. It just goes to show how uneducated some people can be about the gay population. if you need a laugh then this is the one to watch.
2,This is the silliest movie i've ever seen!,"Although far better than Bar Girls, this movie ranks high in the ""stupid lesbian movie"" category. It's funny though, and I somehow recommend seeing it... but don't buy it. I won't ruin the ending for you, but it will undoubtedly inspire laughter. e.g: ha ha ha! Happy Viewing! Watch it after a breakup to remind you not to date those dreaded: ""bi-curious"" girls."
2,Nothing In This Water...,"If you're looking for actors who can act...don't buy this dvd! The storyline is cute, but the two main characters have no chemistry whatsoever. The sex scene was pathetic...the actresses looked so uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable! Don't waste your money on this one, save it for ""Better Than Chocolate"" or ""When Night Is Falling""."
4,It's In The Water,I loved this movie.Both lead characters have tons of chemistry alone or together.This movie is over ten years old having been made in 1996.I feel that it is well ahead of the other movies made during that time frame.Lots of humor thrown in.Don't be in the mood for a serious movie when you watch this.Try to have fun with it and see the humor in not only the acting but the scenery and the clothing.Don't forget this was made independantly (which means only one camera was used)thus you will see a few bloopers.The two sex scenes are done quite tastefully yet both are beautiful in there own way.Spend a few bucks on this and I'm sure you will be pleased.
2,The problem with indies,"Although I, too, appreciated the story and the message which this film sent, I couldn't help but think about one of the sad facts of ""indie"" GLTB film making, i.e., indie = not very well made. ""In the Water"" basically could have used a way, WAY more competent screenwriter, a way, WAY more incisive director, and with a few exceptions, way, way, WAY more talented actors, as opposed to those who are graduates of the Indie Filmmaking School of Hysterical Overacting. As it happened, I watched ""Water"" on the same evening as I watched ""Hairspray"". I fully understand, of course, that ""Water"" probably had a total budget equal to John Travolta's wardrobe costs in ""Hairspray"", but the contrast was there nonetheless. And not in ""Water's"" favor. In short, watchable for the message. Pretty gruesome in the execution."
3,You've all heard this line..... this movie is worth a viewing,"While the sleepy socially elite residents of a southern suburb are awakened by the clichéd rumor that the drinking water causeshomosexuality, the town is confronted with some of its most unexpected residents coming out of the closet. With several adorably humorous, classicly gay characters, as well as the development of a profoundly intimate lesbian relationship between high school best friends, ""It's in the Water""covers the heavy topics of identity, heterosexism, AIDS, race, and class.With a playful, over the top cast, this film is bound to get a few giggles from everyone while carrying home a hard-hitting message about the nature of homophobia in the south that is sure to resonate with all audiences."
4,Its still raining,"I HAVE JUST HEARD THIS CD AND IT HAS JUST BLOWN ME AWAY, FROM TRACK 1 TO 12 IT DOES'T FOR ME. MY FAVORITE IS TRACK 10 DON'T LET IT BE A DREAM, THE SAME GOES FOR YOU MICHAEL, HOPE I HAVE NOT JUST DREAMT ABOUT THIS ALBUM, GO HARD AND BRING ON A REAL DOWN POURYOURS IN THE BLUES ED"
1,"Spotty performance, useless for iTunes","I purchased this hard drive to use as my music library with my Mac and iTunes. It doesn't work. As the drive heats up, iTunes will only play portions of a song, then move on to the next song. This does not happen with other hard drives, just the La Cie Porsche design hard drives and many others have had the same problem (check the iTunes forum over at Apple.com and you'll see).Also, when hot, the drive will frequently do odd things, showing full folders as empty. Yes, these drives are cheap compared to the prices of others on the market, but in the end, you get what you pay for."
3,Fair,"I commend this piece for it's value but every Product has it's shortcomings including this one.My Specs: p4, win xp, 512mb memoryPROS:-true plug and play-great value-small size (to help you conceptualize- about as big as a VHS cassette but lacie's peice is 3/8"" thicker)-quietCONS:-overheats easily-transfer rate is a bit slow even if it us USB2.0 (my comp is usb 2.0 capable but i do transfer large files as big as 3 to 6 gigs)In my opinion it was worth buying because as i see it the pros outweighed the cons. I don't use this hard drive for constant use. When i want to watch a movie or listen to music i just use this bad boy. If your going to buy a dedicated hard drive why not upgrade to an internal one? a couple of my friends use their ipods for file transfers whenever we go over each others apartments and i bring this. It's 1/3 less then their cost and it's storage space is 7/8 larger."
5,Had no problems with 80GB version,"I have the 80GB version of the LaCie Porsche Drive. I've used it for over a year, backing up about once a month. I've never had any problems with it. Nice design, easy to use, I recommend it.I've had no trouble with the LaCie brand - it hooked up easily via USB, was ""plug and play"" with XP, and you can drag files to it like a hard drive or use windows backup tool to create compressed backup files, and it hasn't failed on me.I didn't run it constantly, but it has been on for days at a time before and never generated any errors or other issues.For a low-cost 160GB drive, check out the Acomdata drive on several online sites, they are often offering a rebate."
3,good music,"pictures at an exhibition is done twice on this cd. the first, is entremont doing the entire thing on solo piano. and the second, with full orchestra as conductor of the denver symphony orchestra. i enjoyed the solo piano version a lot. the orchestra version is well-done, precise and flawless, but lacks the intensity, and dynamics that ""exhibition"" truly deserves. informative booklet about ""exhibition"" and entremont. total running time: 62:53."
3,What a waste for a title,"I would strongly disagree with the publisher that this is a horror novel. Soft porn -- yes, Suspense -- yes. Horror -- NO! Laymon did have me reading nonstop to see what would happen, but ultimately most of the surprises were not -- they were very predictable. I did get way too much of a teenage boy's sexual escapades and frankly those moments that happened to the main character were so unlikely I skipped over them just to find the horror/scare that Publisher's Weekly had promised on the front cover of the paperback edition.It's too bad this title, premise and even cover art were wasted on this book. If you want a mindless read and don't want to be caught reading a romance novel, this book is for you. The only sleep you'll lose is actual reading time. There's nothing scary here!"
3,MIdnight Vampire Show.....Not what you think,"I Really have to say I love Laymon BOOKS but this story is like the ""Stand By Me"" cast waiting for the end of ""Twilight"". This book is written for a one day event and by the time that you get to tne middle of the book you wanna know where the vampires are. Sorry to be so harsh but our three main characters are your average characters with a few other characters thrown in and might as well jump to the last two chapters for the fianle cause you will only get a character description through out the rest of the book. The last two chapters are exciting however."
4,"Good book, great ending","I started reading Laymons books when I was at Waterstones one day and was looking at the Stephen King books for one I hadn't read - and discovered that there was none! So I picked up one of Richard Laymons books - the island - and thought Id give it a try. Ever since then I have been a huge fan of Laymon. This is my sixth Laymon book and I have yet to read one that I didnt enjoy (or one that I was able to put down either). This is not one of his better books in my opinion but it won a Bram Stoker award (whatever that is) so it must appeal to most people. It is more of a teen adventure story because the ""horror"" does not really start until they arrive at the Traveling Vampire Show in the last 100 pages. As I say, not his best book but Laymons' worst (which I'm not saying this book is) is still better than any other authers' best"
4,Laymon is food for the starved Stephen King fans!,"I just recently discovered the Richard Laymon books. He apparently hasn't published a lot in the US. I've been a die hard King fan for years and have been really disappointed in his work lately. Laymon is almost as good as King when he was at his best with the early books. Vampire Show is fast paced, totally unpredictable and fun to read! Laymon seems to always throw in a little sex with his story line which keeps things interesting. I am now on a quest to read all of Laymon's books.King fans will love this book but it's not for the squeamish!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A couple of teenage boys are doing their own thing, when they get news that the circus is on town.This one is a little bit different, in that it claims to have a vampire in tow.As it turns out, the claim is correct, and the vampire babe leads to escapades and death.It is really a bit on the slow side for a reasonable part of it."
3,Has some bite.,"A good, original vampire yarn is hard to come by these days, but LAYMON pulls it off well with this story about innocence lost and terror found. THE TRAVELLING VAMPIRE SHOW is a punchy, swift read filled with good characters and some visually harrowing scenes. There are some short descriptive lulls, and a fair amount of eroticism that slows the momentum, making the novel a bit less intense than it coould've been. Almost all vampire stories have to add the flavor of sexuality, which I understand is part of the vampire mythos, however takes away from the creepy factor of a being who drinks human blood to live (undead, of course). This book elevates above most bloodsucking sagas I've read, but not above some of the better horror lurking out there."
5,A classic,"Layman isn't going to write the prettiest sentences, or long descriptions of houses with picket fences and blah blah blah. What he does do is write really good stories with great action and dialogue.I wish there were more authors like him. his books are always scary and fun. This book was no exception. A cross between Stand by Me, and Something Wicked This Way Comes. It builds, slowly, but comes crashing through in the end with some intense scenes."
4,Enjoyable,"This was the second Laymon novel I have read, and it is certainly much better than Resurrection Dreams. The story takes place in 1963 and involves 3 young friends Dwight, Rusty and Slim(who happens to be a girl) The story is mainly about their quest to go see the Traveling Vampire Show and the series of strange events that lead up to it. Typical Laymon sprinklings of sex are found throughout with the ever horny Dwight lusting after Slim and his sister in law Lee. Having a lusty vampire Valeria doesn't help either. Most of the story is a coming of age tale, with the horror being racheted up in the final 50 pages or so. The story was interesting and kept me wanting to read just one more chapter before going to bed. Based on this book, I will be picking up more Laymon novels."
2,Could have been shorter,"After reading the ""The Traveling Vampire Show"" by Richard Laymon I felt robbed. Three hundred and fifty pages of character development, with little story gusto. There's nothing wrong with character development if it was a novel but it's a horror book, which should mean more suspense and killings. If you read ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" by Ray Bradbury that's all you need to read. This story is about a couple of kids who wreck the plans of an evil vampire who comes to their small town in a traveling vampire show. That's it. The story doesn't come alive until the last fifty pages of a four hundred page book."
4,A good read.,"I really enjoyed this book, and it moved along at a fast pace. There are some bizarre things that happen (i.e. the relationship between Rusty and his sister) that I found quite disturbing. I really like the way that Laymon had all these creepy things going on throughout the book, and in the flashback sequences. Totally kept my attention. I was a little disappointed with the ending. It seemed to be building up to something bigger than what actually happened. Had it not been for the ending I would have given this book 5 stars. All in all though it was a good book, and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of horror."
1,BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU'RE 12,"I bought this book on the advice of several of your reviews, but it is certainly not for the discriminating horror reader. It is juvenile and silly and the middle 100 pages could be eliminated by saying, ""Dwight's horney"". I could have cared less about Dwight and his hard-ons, or Lee and her ripped-off blouse.The most interesting character, Bitsy, was not even given a hearing, much less a plot line. I can understand why Richard Laymon is more popular in Europe, where readers are less educated and far less well-read.This writer would not stand up two seconds next to King or even Saul or Koontz.If you're 12 and need some assistance with fanticization, buy this book. Everyone else forget Laymon. I'm sorry he died, but it may be for the best for the horror genre.Fort Wayne, Ind"
2,So-so,"The more I read Laymon, the more I dislike him. This is the 5th offering of his I've bought, and I am beginning to worry about the man's mental health. If you've read ""Come Out Tonight"" you'll undoubtedly notice the similarities between that book's villain, Toby Bones, and Rusty in ""Travelling..."". Fat, immature, delusional and degenerate. If I knew anyone remotely like either of these characters, I would quite happily punch him in the face. Laymon's characters tend to be inneffectual and irritating, and I implore anyone who is looking for an introduction to Laymon not to read this book. Go and read ""The Midnight Tour"" instead."
2,Sloppy story and very sloppy proof reading,"I felt that the story had alot of potential, but zero follow through. I have read three other Laymon stories and liked them. It seemed to build the characters up pretty well, getting you to care what happens to them. But like alot of the reviews (2 or 1 star ones), the story just fizzled out. The ending seemed like some crazy twist was about to happen and Slim was going to be the hero/tough girl. And I was looking forward to the new story branch and then fizz.... story over.I dont know if this was just my Kindle version, but there were sooooo many grammatical errors and strange ""pastings"" of ""- Richard Laymon"" through out the book. I have not read any other reviews with this mentioned. Seriously, was it just my copy?"
5,Holy meetings in Jerusalem,"In this pioneering work Herbert Weiner recounts his meetings with a number of Jewish teachers in Jerusalem. He reveals a world or worlds which at the time were little known outside the Holy Land . This book has about it the feeling of discovery, of new promise in the world of Jewish learning. It is inspiring and still very much worth reading today."
5,Love the coffee maker,We could have bought a new coffee maker but loved this one so much we just wanted to replace the carafe which got a chip on the edge. We were delighted that we were able to replace it. It would have been nice to have been able to purchase it with black trim but we were able to exchange the parts from the old one and it works great.
2,"book was great, movie wasn't","I was eager to see this movie after reading the novel, and I have to say I was disappointed. As far as movies go, I thought this was one of the worst I have ever seen. While it is faithful to the novel, I thought some scenes were very poorly done, cheesy, and not entertaining at all. It was painful to watch and the soundtrack was terrible too. If you want to be depressed and see a lot of a hairy naked chick, buy this movie. You have to be one of those literary types to enjoy it even a little bit."
1,"Incredibly dull, poor acting, poor cinematography, just dreadful","This film does not do justice to Orwell's novel whatsoever.The acting performances are mediocre and passionless, there is no emotional connection, and the way the movie handled scenes from the book seemed curiously amateurish. This feels like a dated and cheap made for TV movie, a total waste of time.Maybe someday in the future a film adaptation of the novel will be done right, here's hoping for that day!"
3,Kudos to No Soundtrack Alternative comment,"I agree with the review of this DVD concerning the lack of the Eurythmics soundtrack. This really makes the film a much different experience than the one I enjoyed and coveted all these years on VHS. Director Radford has made a huge miscalculation in judgment, if he's the one responsible. I would like to point out that the UK release of the DVD had the original electronic soundtrack, if you want to track that down. The grinding drone of string instruments on this DVD version overdoes the depression."
2,A little boring,"The book is of course a classic, but the movie does not do a great job of capture the emotions of the book."
5,Do not watch this movie with a loaded gun nearby,"...I believe it is essential to read the novel then watch the movie. If you have seen the movie without reading the novel you should read it and then go back and watch the movie. I agree that it is almost impossible to translate a novel into celluloid but I believe the pathos this movie exudes is breathtaking. It is stark, melancholic and disturbingly close to Orwell's vision. Radford drew from the core of the literary creation and gave his movie pungent and decadent life. Orwell would have approved of the movie but not of the world's current state of affairs, which he had himself predicted..."
4,Another Dystopian Classic Removed from Mass Consumption,"I thankfully was able to rent this minor classic from the library, but why is it out of print? Seems so inexplicably bizarre. I have been checking frequently for the past year or so, and still, you can't get it used for less than $85 and new will cost you $170! You would think that they would keep a popular classic like this in stock, if for no other reason than their bottomline! And what of this film's historical significance? It was the late great Richard Burton's final role onscreen.Obviously, it is the message contained therein which these cowardly tyrants are afraid of.Get this out to the public Amazon!!"
3,"1984 ""1984""","Fairly good movie (1984 made in ""1984""), better then the 1956 version of 1984 but still not worth the $40 + price tag!"
4,good Arabic study,"I find this a very friendly book for the beginning process of learning Arabic grammar. It assumes a knowledge of the alphabet, sun and moon letters and the capacity to transliterate Arabic. It presents it's information in small chunks, easy to assimilate. It is very readable and easy to understand. It's vocabulary is useful to readers of the Quran. It gives a foundation on which to build a more complex understanding of the language."
1,"Can't connect at 108mbs, max is 54mbps","The card worked really well except for one little thing. There is no way to enbale super G mode (you need it to connect at 108mbps). Without the most I could connect at was 54mbps. The quick install guide and the manual said it's available, but it wasn't. Tech support was able to reproduce my problem, and tried many, many things. Even though they were very helpful, they coudln't fix it.My guess is that it's going to take a firmware upgrade to enable Super G. If you can wait for that, then you will be happy. I returned mine, and bout a Linksys WPC54GX."
5,A must see!,"This has got to knock Steven King off his thrown! No offense, I love King, but it was absolutely spine-chilling. Do not watch it alone. Especially, do not let children watch it, as children are victoms. RENT THIS!!!"
1,I must have seen a different movie,"I have one word for this movie. Sad! Disfragmented, plotless, acting that hit many valleys and very few peaks (which is surprising, considereing the accomplished cast), the only near interesting facet of this film was the underwater town, which seems to have been thrown in as visual candy as opposed to being REALLY necessary to the plot. Do not waste your time or your money. Invest in something like Silence of the Lambs if you want to be scared."
3,a lost story,"The first part of story seems to have some suspension and frightening plot, but the story got lost on 2nd part. It is not any actor's fault perhaps, but director's or screen play writer's. As the story reached the end, I don't even feel I care anymore, even though it would shock you at the last scene. Once again I like Rober Downey Jr.'s protrait of Vivian, a dark, weired, routhless but still charming killer, who only appeared actually on the 2nd part of the film. But it didn't save anything from the lost story, which wasn't that good really. Maybe the only thing the film has achieved is its visual effects, beautiful, haunting and chilling."
5,"Scary, suspenseful and smart","This is not your typical horror/thriller. The cinematography is incredible, especially the dream sequences. The acting is first rate, especially Annette Bening. It is very well-written, it doesn't insult your intelligence. The unique cinematography and sound effects make this a particularly good watch on DVD. The DVD also contains interesting tid bits about the making of the film."
1,'The Company of Wolves' it is not!!!!!,"First of all, 'Wolves' is very much a surreal fantasy, romantic and fairy tale like. 'In Dreams' is sickly disturbing, and the acting wasn't very convincing either. If it must be compared to something, try 'Candyman', though more violent and graphic in nature, it leaves the viewer wondering about the definition of insanity. 'In Dreams' asks no deep questions, and isn't scary. I would not call kissing the (known) killer of your child romantic or sexy either, but very disturbing. Sharing and manipulating dreams, are not new concepts to film, and this one exploited them poorly. If you like horror, fantasy, or romance look elsewhere - there are plenty of good movies to choose from. If you like to conclude a movie with the words; ""it left a bad taste in my mouth"", then try 'Dead Ringers', 'Damage', or 'Barton Fink', at least the acting is light years ahead of this!"
3,Great book....SLOW service.,"The book itself is wonderful (5 stars). My disappointment was with the supplier. I was trying to get the book to my married daughter who was struggling with a frustrating job situation and needed encouragement quickly. I thought a copy of the book from her childhood would give her a boost to her confidence and make her smile, but it wasn't delivered in a timely manner. Also she thought it had been sent to her in error, because there was no indication in the shipping material that it was from me."
3,"great knuckle protection, but no hand support","At first I loved these. Used them for kickboxing and muay thai (not for boxing). Easy to put on and fit comfortably, but no hand bone support. my Right hand (heavy hitting hand) started to hurt after a few days of use. decent wrist support for me. They are too tight for hand wraps to go under and too big for wraps to go over. Probably acceptable for light bag work (not a speed bag, though . . . too thick). But since most of my time is spent with 100+ lbs bags, I'll jsut keep these in my gym bag for now!"
2,Disappointing,"I don't usually watch foreign films, but I'm trying to be more cultured, and my girlfriend is one quarter Italian, so I thought I'd take in an Italian flick to see if I could understand why she's yelling at me all the time. Anyway, this movie was a real drag! First of all, the dude playing the romantic lead was big old tubby guy, totally unbelievable that Mimi would fall for him. Couldn't they have got Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp to play the romantic lead? Also, I don't know when David Hasselhoff got into foreign movies, but his italian accent was terrible! Also, the thing was subtitled like an old japanese godzilla movie, the actors would be going on and on really excited about something, and the subtitled would say like: ""pass the salt."" I think maybe they were saying something dirty, but the translator tried to cover it up because she was embarrassed. Anyway, the italians should stick with making pasta, and leave the movies to Hollywood."
5,Season Two on its way,"Season Two is being release MAY 15th, 2007. HOOORAAY! The best comedy ever. And question for Ann, Have you even seen the show?"
5,Great album,I am very pleased with the condition my vinyl came in and the vinyl itself. It came very quickly considering that it had to take a trip across the country. Diamond Dogs is such a brilliant album. I recommend every Bowie fan to buy it!
5,Best on vinyl,"This is an album that truly is best on vinyl. The record really is just one big story, and the transition between songs is critical. Listening to a digital copy of this amazing album is still great, but it is hard to remove the pause between songs. ""Sweet Thing-Candidate-Sweet Thing (Reprise)"" as an example, should be viewed as one song with three parts and seamless transition is important. Other than that, the sound is incredible and makes me want to listen to more Bowie on vinyl."
5,In my top ten favorite albums ever,"I have no idea what the person who reviewed this album below is talking about. Trust me you need this album. I can't stop listening to this, it's taken over my life. This one here is very unique, the guitar is wild and all over the place but comes together perfectly. The vocals are so distinctive and just plain rockin'. The electric guitar intertwines itself with the acoustic so well you almost don't notice it until it kicks you in the soul. The chorus's in this masterpiece are absolutely beautiful. I remember the first time I heard this thinking that this is music right here, this is how it should be done. I mean it, if you want a better life get this album and be happy, be free. The Soviet Union really came through with this one. Out of struggle insane beauty is born."
3,"Inspirational, but not very practial","This book is filled to the brim with inspirational talk for people who want to write. Elbow tends to emphasize non-fiction, which is a bit of a shame. Most of what he says boils down to: write a lot and revise a lot. Although that is sane advice, it hardly justifies the number of pages Elbow has filled. The last half consists of vague, non-directional musings about the ""voice"" of a writer--a concept Elbow can't even describe with sufficient detail to be of any practical use.So all in all, this book is a bit of a mixed bag. When you're stuck in a rut and need some ideas to keep your juices flowing, this might just do the trick though."
5,"""krakka""","I first came across Writing with Power in our university library when I was starting my thesis in my final year of my Architeture Degree in 1991.Up to then, my essay writing or writing generally - was lousy!!!!. So I was looking for a book which may help me.Well what a surprise.Peters suggested that writing be broken into 2 stages -1. writing of ideas,and then2. editingThis new process provided for me , a creative person , a breakthough in a how to write that was contrary to how I had been taught to write ( writing and editing at the same time) which quite frankly didn't work for me.Now armed with this more creative process, I was able to write and draw my thesis, graduated with 2nd class honours - much better that barely passing.I reckon this ought to be a basis text book introduced to all students, at any level of schooling.Now that I have found this book available on the web, after 15 years, I going to get myself a copy -Thanks Amazon and Peter.ps didn't help my english though."
2,Writing with Power,"I just didn't click with the writer of this book. It's chock full in fine print, full of a lot of info; I just didn't care for it."
4,"Writing with Power, Book Review","Book is pretty good. I am a writer though, so it seems like the first few chapters talk about things I already know, even though I am young. I have recently graduated from college, so maybe that's due to my background. I haven't read past the first few chapters. I hear the book gets better and advice stronger."
3,hard to use,"This product isn't really that great. The tutor doesn't really help because everything they say is in Spanish, French, German or Italian. Also the Intelliplan is hard to figure out because again it isn't in English. I bought this product because I wanted to learn a new language but if you don't already know some of the basics then you are completely lost. The only part of this program I do like is the headset feature.The headset allows the program to ""rate"" your pronounciation which is very helpful."
2,Typical darkhorse,"Go read the novel instead. The art will be better if you imagine it instead. As usual darkhorse has a bad track record when it comes to artists. As soon as i opened it, i knew i was in trouble. Why cant they get someone like Jim Lee?"
4,Great Literature from the Border,"This collection of poetry, essays, and photographs does a wonderful job both of depicting the hardships faced by Mexicans and Central Americans in their homelands, and of showing how these hardships have led them to undertake the ardous, sometimes dangerous, trek across the border into America.The Hispanic culture is full of vitality and color, and through these works we can clearly see the richness that it has added to its adopted homeland. Some of the works in this collection are not translated into English, but not enough of them to keep readers who don't understand Spanish from getting a complete picture of these immigrants' experiences through the rest of the works included. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in gaining a greater understanding of the border culture and its people."
1,This book is garbage and I deal in undergrounds,"I've been selling underground comix for years and this books is garbage galore. First off, the pricing is all wrong and is based on a few select people that want to control the industry for their own businesses. It's not even an even estimate of the prices of the old books. Now the real bad thing about this book is that undergrounds have continued to be published all the way up to this year and I'm one of the dealers that sells those taboo comics from all years. So much is missing and it's a crime that a real guide isn't published that is honest, makes sense, has a real underground sensibility, and is a service to all of the lovers of this genre. Another control mechanism of a bunch of neo conservatives is this book."
5,Two Great Disney Legends,"This isn't on the market right now, but I hope it becomes available. Both Johnny Appleseed and Pecos Bill are wonderful Disney stories that many would love to have. I feel Disney would make a nice profit on these movies.Bring them out on DVD and Blu Ray soon... PLEASE."
3,Not Morrow's best work,"While still very good in its own right, I count This Is the Way the World Ends as one of Morrow's weaker efforts. The book details the end of humanity and the quest of the last surviving humans to both survive and make some meaning out of their existence.In his work, Morrow handles the most serious topics (the death of God, the end of the world) with an sense of inventive whimsy that can almost always overcome the inherent absurdity of the subject matter -- but This Is the Way the World Ends is long on absurdity and short on inspiration. This Is the Way the World Ends has many absurd moments, but too few genuine moments to make it all come together the way it did with Towing Jehovah or Blameless in Abaddon.As an author, James Morrow still stands head and shoulders above the pack in my book, and This Is the Way the World Ends is definitely a volume worth picking up -- but I would do so only after you've devoured his other works."
2,Kurt Vonnegut Wannabe,"I was disappointed in this novel. I was expecting science fiction and got fantasy.Morrow seems to want to be Kurt Vonnegut. His plot twists, unfortunately, don't measure up to those of Uncle Kurt.The Lewis Carroll references were overdone.I can't see this being recommended along side THE LAST SHIP, ON THE BEACH, and similar books. If you are looking for apocalyptic fiction, look elsewhere."
1,Louie is a pain...,"I was looking forward to this game as I love playing game shows on the PS. However, the graphics are slow in loading and not impressive and Louie is just down right annoying. I would skip this one if I was you."
2,Wrong cable for my application,"I needed this cable to connect my Mac Mini to an HP 1905W LCD monitor.Turns out that although the computer supported DVI-D dual link, the monitor only supported DVI-D single link, so it would not fit.Unfortunately I did not know this at the time of ordering.It wasn't worth the effort shipping it back, so I still have it - virtually unused.The product itself seems well engineered, but I do not have any other DVI-D dual link devices to test it with."
2,Could have been better,"If you loved the first game, this sequel will be somewhat of a disappointment. It is simply not as much fun as it could have been."
4,Excellent look at culture,Some things I like about the book:- excellent writing and not filled with typos like most technical books; care was obviously taken with this book- superb look into culture and unstated assumptions in OO/XP development- unique perspective on OO that doesn't just assume that UML = OO design- David West is obviously very creative and has great vision into the big picture of software developmentSome things that could be better:- the book starts out abstract and by the end still feels abstract- I'm left feeling that I agree with most things that I read but I have no idea how to apply them; just stating that relational databases are the antithesis to OO doesn't help me in my day-to-day job in which I have no choice but to use an RDBMS
2,Pictures don't represent quality,"I had high hopes for this book. There isn't enough out there to visually represent the work of Westwood. These pictures catalogue her work from the early 70's to her latest collections, but none are of high quality decent enough to compliment her outstanding and truly creative visions. Better to spend your money on the ""Universe of Fashion"" book on her, or if you're looking for literature, check out ""Unfashionable Life"" by Jane Mulvagh."
4,thp8: the better of the tony hawk games,"this is overall my favorite tony hawk game. although 2 more are coming out soon, i don't think they will be so good. they should stop for a breather every couple of years, jeez! bad call on activision's part. this game, which is so much better then american wasteland, is better suitable for children and is physically unbelievable. buy buy buy!!! :-)"
4,Cons and Pros,"tony,tony,tony i loved american wasteland and could not wait for p8. i was a tad bit dissapointed. the classic mode is built in with the story mode, i never really enjoyed classic so this is a con. another is the fact that there is no mode. like easy normal or sick. i usually start with easy then move up but i guess it's automatically on normal so after u beat there is nothin else to do except beat side missions.but i 3njoy3d p14y1in6 i7 50 1 64v3 it this score.3=e1= i or l6=g7=t5=s4=a"
5,Medieval entertainment,"I read this for my European Epics class and could not put it down. It is a very long book (about 1500 pages total), but it does not feel long. It has a everything a story should have. It is also extremely entertaining. Ariosto was a genius. Furthermore, the Reynolds translation is the best one out there. The notes are extremely helpful and the character index makes it easy to find the info you need when writing a paper."
3,pretty good,this film had some good moments&then other moments where it kinda dragged in spots for me. I prefer other Blake Edwards Films&also Dudlet Moore.same with Amy Irving but they have Chemistry in here.i hadn't seen this film in years.it has some moments.
2,"""It's Fun! It's Girls! It's Song! It's Color!""","And it made money! ""Tickle Me"" actually saved Allied Artists from financial ruin. However, 1965 proved to be Elvis Presley's last year as a major box-office draw. The primary virtue of this fluffy musical-comedy lies in its excellent soundtrack - comprised of songs from the ""Elvis Is Back!"" (1960) and ""Pot Luck"" (1962) albums. Presley makes the most of his low-budget surroundings, displaying nice chemistry with Julie Adams and Jocelyn Lane. Neither the best nor worst of Elvis Cinema."
5,The holy grail and an oasis for every BTAS fan,"This book is brilliant and amazing. Finally all my answers about this popular TV shows have been answered.What I love about this book is that we all get to see the secrets about how and why this program be came so popular and forever will be embeded into television history. Final comments to Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and all those brains behind BTAS,one of the most entertaining books I've read in years and PLEASE! come out with another book like this one. To Kevin Conroy, baby, you're the greatest!"
4,Very convenient,"Same one they sell at Sears for twice as much. Keep your deep-throat as well as standard depth sockets on one rail.Only ding one star for looseness of the attachment of magnetic strip to the plastic casing, pretty simple to fix with a couple rivets."
4,Are You Unable to Articulate Your Raging Emotions?,"Let Bryan Hartley do it for you.This album is everything that rock and roll is about. Remember what Jack Black said in School of Rock, how rock is about sticking it to the man? Whoever the man may be (and in the case of this record, the man is most certainly a woman), this album tears at you with its sincerity and depth. About half the record are songs that you want to be listening to while driving with the top down, playing as loud as you think you can before blowing out your speakers. There are others, contemplative and earnest, that are best heard when alone with your emotions.This record is sophisticated but honest. Yearning but aggressive. It is not pretensious or formatted or stylized. It is what rock and roll should be but often isn't.You know the experience. You buy a lot of records. And some of them leave with you an unsatisfied feeling after a listen. Like the music wasn't real sustenance. Other albums feed your soul. This is one."
4,"Awesome movie, a little grainy on the video","Great movie! I love the movie!The picture is somewhat grainy. It might be pretty noticeable on a large TV. Ours is under 30"" and one of the older TVs (before HD meant anything). Farther away, the grainy was unnoticeable.Would have liked a better quality picture on the DVD. DirecTV's replay of Overboard wasn't grainy the last time I saw it."
3,a so-so movie,It is funny but it is not one of Goldie Hawns best movies. I do like it thou. And I say if you are looking for a movie to watch on a rainy day then choose this one.
4,Feel Good Film,This is a wonderful lighthearted comedy with soul.Played to perfection by Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell (real life partners)Really recommended. You can look at the others for more of a synopsis ... just wanted to add my vote.
4,Very Funny,Silly and light hearted with a good moral story.Goldie Hawn & Kurt Russelll at their Comedic best!
3,Slightly Unhappy,"I am just slightly unhappy as a movie buff. The movie itself is just fine,but I would really have liked to have known ahead of time, that I was NOTgetting the cover that is shown in the picture! I know there are a lot ofpeople out there who are probably saying ""big deal,"" but I like to get certaincovers for certain movies - preferably NOT the newer ones."
1,Buyer Beware!,"The book has pretty pictures, so why not hire author Randall Koll, who is not a certified interior designer? It may turn out to be a very costly mistake. We hired Randall in the fall of 2006 to organize and furnish our home. In January 2007, Randall was given a check for thousands of dollars to buy furniture. It is now August 2007 and our home is still not organized and we still do not have new furniture. Randall has not returned any calls or e-mails since May. So save your money and learn from our expensive mistake."
4,Newlywed Review,"Loved the book. Wished I could make all my spaces look half as lovely. The catch? I'm newly married and trying to combine 2 furnished households into 1, on top of the wedding gifts.I would have loved helpul hints on decluttering what we already have. Or how to sort through what to keep and reuse in the new space and what to toss out!I'll use this book as inspiration!!!"
4,those androids,the uncuts of the DBZ series shows blood and spit and this one shows blood and spit. great sequences are when Trunks and Adult Gohan fight Android 17 and 18 and we get to see how Trunks turns super saiyan and how it goes into the series. exciting and exhilarating
4,Must have for any trunks fan,"Seeing both the VHS and DVD version of this, I have to say the DVD version is much better. For any fan of trunks, I strongly recommend getting this. The DVD has both the English and Japanese voices, as well as subtitles in both languages. The emotions come across better with while watching the japanese version. It tells the story of Trunks from shortly after the Androids arrival until his journey into the past."
5,This book is the ULTIMATE!,"My family and I share cooking responsibilities and time and time again we go to this cookbook for inspiration. We have tried probably half of the recipes and THEY HAVE ALL BEEN WINNERS!!! This book is excellent: the ingredient lists are short, the instructions are well-written and the photographs are BEAUTIFUL!!! With a well-stocked pantry of easy-to-find condiments and fresh food in the frig or freezer, you can find a recipe for tonight's dinner and make it in 30 minutes or less!!! NO KIDDING! We're ordering several more copies to give as gifts -- it'd be a great wedding gift or for the kids going off to college!"
2,yuck,this band is not the christian band nailed! so becareful! i sticking with christian metal! thankyou! won't be a fan of this band! no thanks! sent it back!
1,"Ordered it, but they cancelled my order without explanation",I order this product and over one week later they cancel my order without an explanation. Just a short email from Amazon - what's up!
5,Bernise Mountain Dog Trevor,"My son loves his stuffed animal dogs, and the Bernese Mountain dog is his newest favorite. It is very realistic looking, as my son, the dog expert, pointed out. He sleeps with it every night. It is well made, and I anticipate it will stand the test of time as his other dogs from this brand have as well."
2,Heavy on newspaper reprints and opinion......light on facts.,Not well written. Disjointed. Over all a poor effort. Much better books on the subject are available.
3,Magnesiumn Oxide 400 mg 120 Tablets,"This product is misleaded by AmericanWholesale, advertised and pictured as Magnesium Oxide 400 mg by Rising but by GeriCare instead."
4,Another interim title,"Like CROSSING THE WATER, this volume was put together before COLLECTED POEMS existed. It is a fine collector's item but otherwise is an unnecessary purchase."
4,nice CD,"While not as good (in my opinion) as the others, it's still got some good tracks. Hippie couple on the cover does hurt it though."
4,fine strong pen,"I have had this pen for many years (couldn't have been more than $40 when I purchased it), and it is my go-to pen for everything that needs good looking lines. I can use a few different brands of ink (uni-ball, foray), so that helps. I am a bit of an OCD engineer, so I am very particular about my pens, and the heft (heavy, but I kinda like that), feel and look all fit my bill. Not a grand statement, but the best pen I have ever owned. Gotta say that I am surprised by the current price, though. Not sure if I would fork out over $200 even for this pen, but I try not to spend more than $70 or so on my writing instruments as I can loose them easily."
4,not bad,"could use more velco to secure it to the walker, other than that it is a decent product for the price"
1,My least favorite kart game,"I found the graphics choopy, the Karts annoying to control, and the tracks boring. The kids and I love Kart games. We still play Mario Kart on Nintendo 64 and a Mickey Mouse racing game. Not to mention, we play CTR on Playstation and have a lot of fun with that. On all those games the Karts are cute, the tracks are fun, and so are the items. Can't say the same for this game."
3,Great suspenseful british empire adventure tale!,"This film is one of those that somehow has slid under the radar but deserves better! Very good british empire themed film without ANY embarrasingly stupid 'hollywood moments' or sappy romance crap. Just a good story with an ever present suspensefull presense to it. The VHS print that is currently available is better in some parts than others. If viewing on a high quality/resolution tv you will need to crank back the sharpness etc a great deal or it will be quite fuzzy, otherwise it's perfectly watchable."
5,Great book,"I have only read the first book and want the second one. The book was wild and suspenseful, it was sometimes even spooky, I LOVED it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Kensington noise reducing headphones,"This Kensington noise reducing bulk pack was disappointing. It is not well constructed and the noise reduction is not powered, i.e. batteries are not required. There is no instruction whatever enclosed with the product. Noise reducing is minimal to non-existent. The most I can say for this unit is that delivery was fast. This was probably on account of a sincere desire to get rid of these units. Since there was no documentation, I may have received something other than ordered, which was product# 33137."
2,Sounds okay but the noise cancellation was lacking.,"I thought I give this product a try since I wanted a headphone that's both inexpensive and has the noise-cancellation feature. The sounds okay but I didn't notice any appreciable reduction in the ambient noise. Gave it a shot and unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations."
3,different interest,"I haven't really seen all of this movie. What I saw was not good but I am interested for a diffent reason. 1) It was filmed partly in my home town in south Georgia and 2) It was written by Winston Groom the author of ""Forest Gump"""
3,Good if you want to hang up sockets on a wall,"There are a few small problems with this product. 1) It will add more weight if you use it in a carrying case because of the magnet. 2) It is not space efficient in tool box drawers. 3) Not all sockets fit in sequence, that is for larger sizes you might have to skip a space or two to get next size socket to seat."
5,Excellent socket rack!,I really like this style of socket holders. If you have a tool cabinet the drawers can be 2 inches or less and this design is roomy. I have another set for metric and sae that I have had for 20 years and they still work great.
1,this movie has fans?,"this movie just downright sucks...i guess if youhave a facination with zombies you might give it benefit of the foubt but not only is there bad acting and a horrible story, its just a horrible movie. The girl should have died 20 times by the end of the movie and shes such a b!tch it just makes you mad she made it out alive. The zombies are all morons, in one scene even resorting to eating itself. the gore was great but it just seemed senseless. I'm a fan of japanese cinema and this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen...next to versus and the returner"
1,Erroneous information on website,"Ad stated this product is an RF headphone set. When received, it was actually an IR headphone set. The ad also states it runs on 2AAA batteries. Actually, it is a mobile set that required 12VDC to power the transmitter as well as the 2AAA batteries."
1,Not safe,"I ordered this fan and it arrived broken. The propeller flew off which was really unsafe and then it just stopped working. I contacted the seller and they were very nice about sending me a replacement, however, the same thing happened with the second one. The propeller is not attached to the fan so it can fly off and hit you in the face at any time - very unsafe. It could absolutely do damage to your eyes or cut your skin. Besides that it does not provide much wind and goes through batteries very quickly. I do not recommend this product."
2,Disappointing!,"At home I sleep with a cool-mist humidifier blowing all night long. I've found that when I travel I miss the coolness and the white noise that the humidifier provide. I thought this fan would do the trick. Unfortunately it's way too noisy to sleep with. The fan makes a nice cool breeze, but the batteries that came with the fan only lasted a couple of hours!"
1,this is not even a product....,running it a little and it is history...We bought fan toadd value to our existing hand-held fan.The product last less than 1 day.
3,PhotoShare 7 Samsonite Carry Case,PhotoShare 7 Samsonite Carry CaseI purchased this case to protect my PhotoShare. I was a bit disappointed to find out how snug the case fits the product. It is almost impossible to get the case either on or off without a great deal of tugging. Perhaps the case should have been stitched to make it less snug.
1,This Game is the Absolute Worst,"If you ever played the original Nascar Racing Game from Papyrus on your PC, don't waste your time with this piece of junk. If you've played games like N3 or N4, you'll probably have congestive heart failure at the sight of this game's HORRIBLE graphics, WORSE engine sounds, and total lack of ability to have a ""cockpit"", like 9/10 of the other racing games out there. If you're looking for a sim, keep looking, because you certainly haven't found it here. If 0 stars was a choice for it's rating, I would have given it that, because one was too many!"
3,Nascar Heat,My main disappointment was it would not work with my V3 steering wheel.How can you do simulation with buttons?I guess it's just an arcade game.
3,Good Choice of Songs,"I guess I was a bit disapppointed in this CD because I expected a bit more energy in the gospels. I have no complaint about the vocals, it's more the arrangements that didn't grab me. I expected the Oakland Gaspel Choir to deliver a more rounding performance, however it may suit others better."
3,Not what I expected... But ok,"I was so excited to see Galaga for the Sony Playstation after years of hunting it down when I was at a pool hall or arcade. I was very disappointed that only the first level stays true to the original arcade game.It does have great graphics and seems like it could have the potential to be a great game but my expectations were shattered when I discovered it wasn't ""the galaga"" I was looking for."
2,Galaga,"I bought this game as a gift for my spouse. WE used to play it for hours in the 70's when we were dating. Of course, then it was a true arcade game. I think I actually meant to purchase Galaxar! This game is O.K., but I am still searching for the tried and true game of our youth. This game is a bit tedious because you cannot save at all. No matter how far you get in each stage, if you don't accomplish the mission, you lose valuable acquisitions."
3,Very average,"This recording 'averages out' but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it above the others by, say, von Karajan or Solti which cost more. Better yet, the Janowski recording is very good and at a bargain price.Here, there is a good sense of drama; the conducting is fast-paced. The digital sound is also good, despite the live recording's necessary obstructions (always unwelcome to me but that's a matter of preference). The soloists range from outstanding (e.g. Ewa Wolak's lightning and thunder, dramatic Waltraute) to disappointing (e.g. Eva Silberbauer's wobbly and unsteady Brunhilde).I'd say that for the price, it's not too bad."
1,Spirituals by Tennessee Ernie Ford,This is a very fine cd by Tennessee Ernie Ford. He does an excellent job of singing the fine songs on this excellent cd. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys excellent gospel singing by one of the very best male vocalist.
5,Wonderful book--words can't describe,"Speaking as someone from an alcoholic family, this book helps you ""detach, with love"" as they say in AA. You realize you can live life for yourself and that you deserve to. The courage to change is needed because the old patterns are familiar and comfortable, but they no longer work. The book brings together wisdom from diverse sources, is divided into 365 short sections corresponding to days of the year, and encourages you truthfully, yet warmly, every step of the way. Read this, it's time to stop beating up on yourself!!"
5,wonderful,"This daily reflection book has a wonderful message for every aspect of ones life, whether it is work, home or just everyday life. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
5,Inspirational,"This little book is full of encouragement and insight into how to live with an alcoholic and be at peace with it. It gives you the tools to change your way of thinking and to take care of yourself. I read it daily and it helps me understand why I feel the way I do and how I can deal with my feelings in a more positive and loving way. This book goes everywhere with me and I believe that it has made me a better, more understanding person."
3,Not as good as One Day at a Time.,May be more appropriate for those who are more secular. Not much of a spiritual perspective. All in all it is definitely a life saver.
4,Davy Jones DVD,"I'm pleased to have this DVD, even though it is rather short at 25 minutes. This is the best interview I've seen on David and most of it is in close-up form which is nice. I also enjoyed the concert footage clips I hadn't seen before. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is OK. As its not easy for me to collect much on David these days due to half his music being download only and his books scarce, this is a valid item to own on him but I wish the interview had been longer. I would recommend this for any new fans of his who want to collect him."
5,Up there with the best,"This four part OVA is simply brilliant. In my book, it rates up there with the original Bubblegum Crisis 8-part OVA and 13-part Tenchi Muyo OVA. The quality of the storyline and animation is excellent. The characters are three-dimensional and the series has to be watched a couple of times to pick up the little subtleties. I look forward to acquiring some more of the Kenshin series, and hope that the animation quality, character detail and plots are equally as well crafted."
5,Incredible,"If you are a Kenshin fan, you don't have to read this. Just go buy it if you haven't seen it yet.If you have not seen Rurouni Kenshin, it just doesn't matter. This is as good as it gets. Animation is beyond most other anime. The story is intricate and incredible. The action is teeth-grinding and what comes after is ""That was so cool.""One note: After watching this you are going to feel empty, like your soul is missing something.... so watch Rurouni Kenshin: The TV Series After!"
1,GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,"Look, you better get the Japanese version if you want the real fun. For heavens sake, this took place in JAPAN! NOT THE USA! So why do they speak in English???????????????????????????????????"
2,Where We Stand: Class Matters,"Where We Stand is a book that relates class and race. As you read you are confronted with a number of instances related to you by the author about her childhood. She does this to illustrate her point when confronted by class discrimination that goes beyond race later in the book. I read this for a College level English class and was constantly analyzing, and picking apart this piece of literature. during the course of our discussion, we came to the conclusion that bell hooks was seeing past the social constraints and looking at the real ""problem"" with society, Class. This seems like a good idea, but throughout the book I was constantly agitated with the way she presents material and argues her point, halfway through the book I put it down, I didn't need this monologue of at times childish whining."
2,Well Written But......,"This book is well written however, it seems to be an American version of Karl Marx's communist manifisto. The author advocates redistribution of wealth for the workers. A scary thought."
5,it is very good book,"i read these books , as part one , as start from study , untill now after master , she has the ability to but the information , in very good easy way , as iam in tropical country , i found it great one"
5,Terrific!,"This book gave our company just what we needed, a clear view into the PeopleSoft Integration Tool environment.It was extremely helpful to us in many ways. We are very pleased with this book as it offers us an excellent perspective into our business systems."
5,GREAT QUALITY & SPEEDY SHIP - ENJOYED CLASSIC MOVIE,"GREAT QUALITY, EASY ORDER, SPEEDY SHIPMENTGIFT FOR HUSBAND - HARD TO FINDDEFINITELY RECOMMENDED to any fans of this movie"
4,hard to find movies,where in the world do you find a hard to find movie to purchase? Well I have been everywhere and so far have not been able to track a single copy of Stone Cold With Brian Bosworth. This movie is action-packed-motorcycle-rally-hunk-babe-fest. So if this is to be seen by everyone why doesn't the makers make more of it for people like me to view any time I want.
3,Dragon Ball Movie,"Most americans aren't quite familiar with the saga before Dragon Ball Z. But everyone knows about it. This saga is more humorous than DBZ is, & not quite as serious. None the less, most Dragon Ball movies are quite good. I recommend this movie for those die-hard fans because it is only the second Dragon Ball movie or tape for that matter, that comes in the uncut version. And everyone knows, UNCUT IS BETTER!"
1,"Definitely, Not Worth the Money","The sticks seemed cheaply made and there was no video. I would have liked to send them back, however since I work three jobs, I was too busy to bother with it."
2,I Wish I Had Started With Some Later Works,"This novel left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems padded out for length- a contract obligation. Our protagonist muses about his reaction to an event, but the reader has to wait a few chapters before finding out WHAT event caused this reaction. More often than not, the event itself is anti-climactic and makes one wonder at the dramatic reaction our protagonist experienced. The constant use of this tactic gets tiresome well before the halfway point. Finishing this novel was a task, and not a well rewarded one at that.In spite of this novel, I explored Clegg's later works and now consider myself a fan.If you're interested in Clegg, put this book at the BOTTOM of your reading list- you may miss out on some great entertainment otherwise."
3,Goat Dance is truly a goat.,"I purchased this book after having read a book by Andrew Harper and looking for someone in the same genre. Clegg was touted by some online reviewers to be the second coming of Stephen King. I purchased Goat Dance and I labored and toiled through half of the book, but in an unprecedent act, I abandoned the rest of the book.Clegg is a good writer, in terms of the style and narrative, but this book was way too slow and far from being a thriller. It was meandering and repetitious and self-indulgent.I do not plan to read any more books by this author."
2,Not really a fighting movie...,"Jet Li and the kid in thes movie are good... when they actually fight which isn't a lot at all. The Kid has a fight scene, and Jet has one at the end..., and aside from the opening that's all there is. I know overall it's a good movie, but I usually just watch Jet Li for fighting... which this movie lacks."
2,The killing of a stuffed animal and the murder of a movie,"My brain is still trying to fathom what my eyes have just seen. I usually enjoy this kind of action movie and I can appreciate it's style, but this is ridiculous. What the heck was going on with the fake dog/sheep thing? I know you can't hurt real animals in movies, but it turned out so cheesy they should have left it out. Movies shown on MST3K had better visual effects. Using the kid as a human yo-yo was just plain silly. And when was the mother going to die? We all knew it was going to happen. Hell, I was looking forward to it. Don't even waste your time. Look out, it's Jet Li's Enforcer! Boot to the head."
3,This movie is My Father is a Hero,"Before buying this movie people should know that it is the same movie as My Father Is A Hero. Having said that, this movie was OK. Jet Li and the kid have one fight sceen each and then they have one together at the end. I watch martial arts movies because I love to see the fight sceens, and this movie just dosen't have enough fights. The story however was pretty good plus Jet Li is in it so I couldn't give it less that 3 stars."
3,Looks like Andy is having the time of his life!,"If you enjoyed the mind games that Andy Kaufman played on friends, family and audiences, you will enjoy this tape. He is at his ebullient best, smiling, singing, having a wonderful time. You will find yourself smiling and having a wonderful time, too. Only problem with this film as far as I am concerned is that Tony Clifton takes up some time on it. Why ever did Andy like that guy so much?!? =)"
2,"it's pronounced ""don't rip-off you previous album.""","i hate to be negative, especially about a very talented artist, but this album just sounded like he copied ""collaborations"" and just switched a few of the words. like ""47 pop stars"" it was just lame compared to the acappela ""47 m.c.'s"" from ""collaborations"" which was brilliant. there are a few good tracks, but i was dissapointed by the lack of creativity. hopefully K.J. will not try to follow what seemed to be a successful formula when he records his next album. COME ON K.J., I'VE HEARD YOU DO BETTER THAN THIS!"
5,I Love It!,"This is best anime I've ever seen. I've watched the whole Kenshin series. I really recommend buying the whole series! Now, check out the independent sellers because you can get the first 48 episodes for a low price. Then you can just get the third set with amazon. Amazon has a great decorated box set.Also, check out the OVA's and the Samurai X movie. This whole set is so beatifully drawn!"
4,The Alpha is a Great First Rocket,"Estes' Alpha rocket is perhaps the best first rocket that a model rocket hobbiest can build and fly.The Alpha is easy to build (simple design, flies straight and true, and is durable. It can be used with a variety of rocket engines for short flights or really long high flights.Building and flying the Alpha teaches the basics of rocket design and how a rocket operates. It is a cheap and fun entrance ticket to model rocketry.Highly recommended.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
5,Authentic,"This was a gift for my mother, whose first language was Polish. She said when she first listened to this music, she wept. It brought back so many memories of singing carols in her childhood. The BEST part about this CD is the insert which has the song lyrics in Polish and English. For someone who is rusty with the language, it's a great aid."
3,Sounds Like...,"So is it just me, or does the lead singer of Boomkat sound almost exactly like Moloko? I don't know how many people are familiar with this artist, but I'm thinking of her song ""Fun For Me"" on the Batman Forever soundtrack...could just be me, though."
3,For the price it was OK,"This game I would put under the Yea I'll play it just to see how it ends.I didn't find it at all challenging and it wasn't difficult to complete.It got redundant real quick in that the game play really doesn't change much through each ""mission""The other thing I found odd was that the ""bosses"" weren't any more difficult to beat than their underlings.I gave it 3 stars because it was a decent enough time waster, but not much more than that.The story line is weak, the load times are a PIA, but I wasn't expecting a lot so when your expectations are low, as long as it's playable, it's fine."
5,MUSIC of KABBALAH by Baal HaSulam,"This music is more than music & more like opening windows of Light in the heart, soul & mind."
1,No improvement over stock,I really can't tell the difference between the stock bulbs and these expensive units. Wouldn't recommend them. The high and low beams I purchased for the same vehicles and from the same vendor work great.
2,C.S. Lewis's Diary of Day to Day Events from 1922 - 1927,"As someone who has read nearly every Lewis title in print, my conclusion about the diary is that it is entertaining in places, is good for giving a feel for what day to day life was like for the author as he was made the transition from student to teacher, and gives fuller information about some of the characters anonymously or only briefly described in SURPRISED BY JOY and LETTERS OF C.S. LEWIS. I doubt, though, that anyone other than a Lewis enthusiast would enjoy the book. It is rather banal, certainly not on par with his later writing, and indeed rather provincial. I recommend it for Lewis scholars as reference material, but not for general reading. His brother Warren Lewis kept a far more interesting diary, posthumously published as BROTHERS AND FRIENDS."
5,Staple in my home,This product is amazing. Used for many years and will not be without. Unique in the fact that it not only kills bacteria but viruses as well. Take immediately at onset of cold or any ill stomach feelings... Comes in pill form as well as liquid drops. Great for sterilizing water and will disinfect hot tubs as well. Safe for humans and animals a like. Do some research online and you will find a website for the many forms of bacteria and viruses that GSE attacks. Buy the Nutribiotic brand as reviewed here - they are the originators of GSE.
3,Don't know,"I have taken this item, but really do not know whether or not it is doing anything for me. I feel no different but that does not mean it is not working."
4,Pleasantly surprised by this little fan,"I bought this fan to diminish my hot flashes! And it does the trick nicely. The ""mist"" is more like a squirt-gun spray, but that's OK. For a tiny little fan, it moves a lot of air. UPDATE LATER: It eventuall broke -- not the sturdiest thing, but what do expect for this price?"
3,Powder Requires blender,"I was trying to find a product that I could use in a self blending sports drink cup. The kind with the metal disk in it. Well this powder is not mean for this type of cup. If you are looking for a protein powder, milk, juice, and/or water to go.., than this is not the powder for you. I don't have time in the morning to pull out the blender to mix this stuff up. Any added protein is good, so that is why I don't give the rating less than 3 stars."
1,One Hour American Dream,"If you like the score to this Movie, you might want pick up the Score to ""Amerian Beauty"" and ""Requium for a Dream"" ..."
4,prologue to the movie Star Trek 2,"Every successful story has to have a great villain; Khan is physically and mentally superior and knows it, what more could you ask for? How can Kirk possibly defeat him? This is from the 60's so it's quite primitive TV viewing now, but it was ahead of it's time back then.This is where the movie franchise got it's start. The second movie picks up the story line 20 years after the TV show."
4,Space seed is a must have Star Trek episode!,"Star Trek episodes Space Seed and the Taste of Armageddon are on this DVD! These episodes are about War! I recommend ""Space Seed"" more because This is the episode that inspired the film, Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan! Space Seed tells the first appearance of Khan Noonian Singh (Ricardo Montalban) and his crew of supermen from the Eugenics Wars in the 1990s. They were rescued by Captain Kirk and his party form the starship Enterprise. they were in suspended animation on spaceship called the Botany Bay! This is a great episode that introduces the classic Star Trek villain, Khan to Star Trek lore. I highly recommend this DVD! A-"
5,Valuable,A great collection of translations from one of the best surrealist poets. A well presented book with a intriguing introduction.
4,A good way to get your feet wet,"I liked this book a lot because it wasn't intimidating. A lot of SAT books are HUGE, and you may feel as if you're drowning in material. This book quickly introduces you to the types of problems you'll see on the SAT, and does it in a way that's fun and makes you want to read on. You'll be feeling better about the whole SAT experience before you know it. The math in this book is not terribly difficult, so it's not for people who want to learn advanced mathetmatics. It's more about how to APPROACH SAT math problems, and the pitfalls most students fall prey to (far more invaluable than a math book on the SAT, believe me). However, the problems in the book are explained very comprehensively, so if you're phobic about math at all, this is perfect for you. I still recommend other books in addition to this one, because it contains no actual practice tests."
3,Save your $$ and get Railroad Tycoon,"This game is fun, a bit confusing at first but it's eassy after you get the hang of it. The AI's are a good challenge, but the teadious task of upgrading trains every some odd yours is a real pain. If you own 50 tracks for say, you have to go through EVERY one of those tracks to updeate the type of train it uses. FOR ANNOYING and not worth the time. I got bored of the game after 2 sessions!!!"
2,Lame Train,This game is ugly. The top down view is terrible it looks like the game was released before the artist were done. I found myself playing in the furthest out zoom and all you really do is look at lines that represent tracks being built. You do manage the railroad but this in itself is not much fun. I have played Railroad Tycoon Gold edition for numerous hours and enjoyed it immencly. I played this game off and on for about a week and have no interest in playing it again.
3,Got Old,My son really enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 but Season 3 was a little disappointing. Needed new material to mix it up
2,Did not catch any attention,This was really boring.I've bought Wiggle's Time and that was really intestering.But this is just song's with some cheap special effect's.This purchase was a waste of moeny.Dont buy this.There are better Wiggle's DVD's available
2,My son didn't seem interested,My son who usually stops everything for The Wiggles was not the least bit interested in this Wiggles DVD. Parents will probably like the music more than the kids. This one just seems targeted at an older audience. Even my 11 year old daughter said it was boring and she usually watches off and on with my son who is 2.
3,Depends on the Child,"My six-year old likes this DVD somewhat, but my two-year old, who is usually a Wiggles fanatic, isn't that interested. While this is one of the most polished productions of all the Wiggles DVDs, it is too sophisticated for the youngest children. Simple songs and dances that are perfect for tots are largely missing from this show. It is much more theatrical and feels self-indulgent. If your children are older Wiggles fans, they might like this high-quality choice. For children three and younger, I recommend Toot Toot Big Red Car or Splish Splash Big Red Boat."
1,Dont Bother,"I loved Jacquie D'Alessandro's previous books, and thinking this one would be funny, heartwarming, and just plain GOOD, I bought it. BIG MISTAKE!!! The heroine is nothing of the sort. I found myself disliking her more and more as I read on. Selfish, nagging, and just plain stupid. As for the hero, he was nothing to write home about. The book is too long, with too many twists that make no sense. Please, save your money and pass on ""Who Will Take This Man."""
5,The Best Book Imn the World,this was one of the best books i have ever read its about Maggie being accused of killing her father and then she escapes and gets a job watching two young boys and then you'll have to read the rest if you want to know what happens!
5,Better on you back,"The handlebar raiser does the trick for a very reasonable price, it makes it much easier on my back because of the position of your body"
1,I hate it,"I was truly looking forward to this product and was extremely dissapointed. The inside diameter is too small and this info is not provided. I own a Fuji road bike. I was going to buy another product until I realized it was manufactured by the same company. Again, no info on the diameter is provided. You just lost a customer."
4,Electric Prunes - 'Singles' (Gone Beat) 4 1/2 stars,"Here's an Electric Prunes compilation CD that until recent I was never aware of. Put out on an unheard-of label Gone Beat - in Israel. With a total of eighteen tracks, eight of these songs do NOT appear on their unofficial release of their must-have 2-fer-1 CD 'I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night / Underground' (see my review) on the Head label. Those eight tunes are as follows ""Ain't It Hard"", ""Little Olive"", ""Dr. Do Good"", ""You Never Had It Better"", ""Everybody Knows You're Not In Love"", ""Flowing Smoothly"", ""Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers"" and ""Love Grows"". Stunning cover, I thought. Recommended."
4,"Peaceful, relaxed and calm","The title of my review says it all. It is how I feel as I hear the first Om come through my speakers. I use this CD mostly as background ""noise"" to help me fall asleep after a stressful or emotional day. There is a resonance to the Om that soothes my soul and aids me in falling to sleep. Perhaps it's just wishful thinking on my part (or a self-fulfilling prophecy), but either way, I enjoy this CD. I will try using it when I meditate as well."
5,"I love, love, love this CD.",This is one of my favorite CDs to listen to while meditating. It helps me focus on Om and tune out everything else.
1,Poorly tested device baffles Cisco Certified CCNA,After 3 hours of troubleshooting my network it appears as though this thing is not compatible with Linksys WAP's. intermittent connectivity and documentation that resembles that of something scribbled on toilet paper (good place for it). Poorly documented features and support does not exist. E-mail off your questions to someone that works at Intel (who acquired us) and when they are bored and need a laugh they'll e-mail you. No FAQ's on the site that could of easily taken care of this early on (during my first visit to the tech support page). I sat here for hours feeling like a fool troubleshooting my network when it had everything to do with Xircom not bothering to test their product with the most commonly placed AP in the market! Anyone have any input or wish to collaborate on this issue e-mail me (...). Keep this POS out of the back of your Visor!
1,absinthe 17,"Rosin was dried, chalky, brittle, and unuseable. I had to discard it. Not a particularly good value."
5,Excellent book on chess variants,"David Pritchard, author of The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, has written a book that features 20 different variants of chess. Variants are given with rules, historic comments, and with examples of play. These are often very illustrative and interesting.Most variants are playable by two players with a usual chess set; in addition, shogi and xiangqi (Japanese and Chinese chess) are given. Overall, a book that I liked a lot, although The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants contains much more information."
2,Did Author's Friends Write Rave Reviews?,"It did not take long for me to lose interest in this book. I can't understand the 5 star reviews! The story was disjointed & the characters were not developed very well. I forced myself to read the entire book. It did not hold my interest. The one redeeming thing that I liked about the novel was the Pittsburgh setting. It was very true to life & the author worked in various Pgh. hot spots, locations, and quirks of the city. Of course I am a native Pittsburgher....so I was able to appreciate these things. I don't know if a reader from elsewhere would enjoy the Pittsburgh details as I did."
4,I really liked this book!,"I wasn't prepared to like this book so much. I found myself drawn into the storyline and caring about the characters. I'm glad there's another book in the Jake Merlin series.For my money, James Tucker has written a great debut novel. He really covers the medical thriller aspect and actually makes it interesting....the author also makes good use of Tory Welch, Assistant DA and Jake's love interest, to keep his readers interested in the legal side of the story.Contrary to some reviewers, I thought Tucker developed his characters AND his story lines with skill and cunning...I look forward to more Jake Merlin stories.Enjoy!"
4,Nice product after...,This is a quality product however i put a little silicone to hold the soap dish part on the bracket. It was a little loose for my liking
5,Securely holds your canoe and much more,"I bought the 579XT to carry my 17"" Grumman Aluminum canoe. These do exactly what they are supposed to do. The padded mounts are easily adjusted on the bars to fit your canoe snugly. The included load straps and bow and stern lines are of good quality nylon with equally excellent ratchets and covered buckles.Best thing is that these carriers are versatile... they helped me carry plywood, tables and a mattress on top of my car. Thule makes a great system and the Canoe Roof Carrier is one great part of that system."
2,Wha' Happened?,"Here's what I said about Season One:""This version of Robin Hood is fantastic. So much better than the '80s Robin Hood BBC series...This is a Robin Hood for fans of Indiana Jones and The Lord of the Rings. A gorgeous score, wonderful costumes, outstanding performances, riveting plots, cunning twists...Aside from the biased, uninformed view against Christianity that is evident in the writing, I endorse this Robin Hood wholeheartedly. Worth the full price! I can't wait for Season Two!""And then I bought Season Two the day it came out...Um...what the heck happened? Did the writers just get in a big hurry? Did everybody lose their sense of humor? All of a sudden, this great Robin Hood story turns into a lackluster, boring crawl through Sherwood Forest. These characters I grew to love (and love to hate) in Season One are now making me want to walk away for a sandwich mid-sentence. I'm very disappointed in the way Season Two decided to turn. I won't be returning for Season Three."
3,Another May-December Romance But Has Its Moments..,"Although Anne Rice is onne of my all-time favorite writers. I had never read one of her ""Erotica"" books until this one. It reminded me of Jackie Collins with much better writing of course. I felt it was too long and Belinda was rather annoying at times. Your standard poor little rich girl. However, I really liked the Jeremy Walker charactor and how he undergoes a transfomation as a result of his relationship with this perfect young thing that just lands in his lap one summer day. It's an uneven,but at times very intriguing look at an oft-written about theme. And I actually did want them to end up together. I suggest reading her other books first though as this one is not the best example of her work."
3,3rd Act Problem,"Perhaps it's just me, but I LOVED the first third of this novel yet couldn't plow my way through the remaining two thirds."
1,Boring...,"I made it through about 45 pages of this book before I had to put it down and just walk away. It is boring, slightly disturbing, and just all around not my thing. I love all of Ms. Rice's other works, but this one is just not up to par."
1,The worst book I've ever read!,"Easily the worst book I have ever read! I was ten pages in when this first occured to me and I should have abandoned the book at that moment. Don't get me wrong, I love Anne Rice. Grew up reading everything she wrote. This little gem escaped me. (Thank God!) The entire premise is an insult to my intelligence. I'm 41 years old and the thought of any man my age ""falling in love with"" a 16 year old, after meeting her ONE time is just plain silly. I guess this was written for sappy teenagers of the world. And, who talks the way these characters talk? The drinking, the smoking, the kinky sex.....it was absurd from the first. And I'm the farthest thing in the world from a prude. Do yourself a favor, read the placemat at a Chinese restaurant. It will be more entertaining."
1,-Negative 5 stars,"I really enjoy Anne Rice and her pen name works. This book however was soooo boring I read to page 97, couldn't take anymore and skimmed the rest reading the end. I don't know what Jeremy did to Belinda in New Orleans, or Marty, Blair, G.G., Alex, Bonnie, Susan etc roles in the outcome. I just didn't care. I am so glad I only paid $1.50 at a used book store for this waste of time, I have never been so disappointed and bored numb. The age difference between Belinda and Jeremy didn't bother me which I was surprised, the only thing I guess is that the ""eroticism"" was so bland and vanilla I missed it somewhere. Please save your money, I have no idea what these other reviewers are going on and on about unless they have never read Rice at her erotic best in the Beauty Trilogy."
2,Does This Novel Not Remind You Of Another?,"The one name title Belinda is quite a la Lolita. In fact the entire novel is. I realize that most story plots are recylced like aluminum cans. This novel is just a little too obvious. The beginning works like a half-way decent mystery. When the mystery is gone half-way through, so is the interest. All that is left is the pretentious prose. In fact, the prose drowns this entire book. I recommend a read of the original Lolita. Lolita is fresh and the prose is thankfully sincere."
3,"Okay, but not the best","Anne Rice has written much better in her time. Jeremy Walker, a 44 year old children's book author and part time artist, falls in love with Belina, and 16 year old beauty with a mysterious past. The book is interesting in ways, but Walker's obsession and [...]relationship with Belinda sometimes creeps me out. I wouldn't recommend this to someone that has a problem with that sort of relationship, like I did."
4,Classic Hitchens,"If you want to know why Hitchens is such an in-demand writer, read this book. The man has an unrivalled talent for polemicism. If this means that his essay on, say, Mother Teresa comes across as a little over-the-top, so what? It's an antidote to everyone else's sheep-like adoration of the woman, usually unsupported by any knowledge of the facts of her life. That's the function of a contrarian, and Hitchens is the best in the business.The book is not all polemicism - elsewhere Hitchens indulges in his love of literary criticism. Readers who wish to know the details of his conversion from opposing the first Gulf War to supporting the Iraq War will also find what they're looking for. If you want to buy just one Hitchens book, this is the one."
1,Have writers the right to be wrong?,"Hitchens is getting boring. His contrarianism feels more and more like schtick and his rabid support of the Iraq catastrophe is the stuff of sour grapes and DT's. HOWEVER, as far as Iraq and Mother Teresa and, yes, even the Dalai Lama go, he has an absolute right to be wrong as long as we have the right to shoot his lies and mistakes down in flames."
3,product incomplete,CD case was blank with no sleeve and no cd info. product arrived in relatively good time.
2,Let's be honest here,"I'm a little mixed in my feelings about this product. If I were to just read the lyrics I would be sold. It's positive and has good intentions...but when the background music begins to play it becomes a whole different story. At first I thought they had accidentally used a 70's porno movie soundtrack! It's cheesy and unpractical to be listened to on a regular basis. Then the ""artist"" begins to sing. Oh boy. My 15 year old dog carries a better tune than her.It pains me to say this about a product that Bob Proctor was involved in since I love his material so much; however, I felt a sane person should review this product and shed some truth about the content.Unfortunately, there isn't too many alternatives to positive music like this - so if, after sampling the tracks, you are still compelled to buy it. Go for it...just don't say you weren't warned beforehand."
1,"Awful production quality, cheesy lyrics","Honestly, the songs on Disney CDs are less cheesy than the lyrics on this CD. Sure, the words are positive, but there's nothing original about the style. I felt like I might as well have been singing a list of affirmations to a Miley Cyrus song. Save your money and purchase motivational songs like ""Unwritten"" and the like. This CD sounds like it was recorded on a very, very low budget."
1,I had to return it.,"I have not returned anything for over 10 years.The text dicussses the FBI agent's feelings.On and on and on...Her feelings...From one mood and feeling, to another feeling...I understand that many will like this, so that is OK.But I could not listen to it...I was thinking: please don't tell me your feelings,on and on, just get on with it and catch the bad guy...Perhaps, this is just me, and, again: I am aware that many many people like this type of writing, and, it sells well.If so, for you, buy it.Be well."
2,Terrible,"I didn't find this book boring, but I did find it incredibly unrealistic and absurd in its plot points.Every character in the story is doted over to the extreme. I found myself wondering how it is possible that every person can be so awesome. Also, the authors fixation on revealing emotions through people's eyes gets very tiresome. I cannot imagine what it must look like for a persons face/eyes to register sadness, fear, a deep longing, gratitude all in the span of 10 seconds. It seems like it is easier to just say that a characters eyes show fury than to actually show his fury through the writing.I can imagine high school kids sitting around coming up with the list of 'things that are sweet and extreme' that a serial killer can do which was shown in this book.Not to mention, the killer was obvious within 10 minutes of reading.Don't bother with this one."
5,Great Read,I really enjoyed this book. Could not put it down. Very exciting and well written. Am looking forward to the next book from Mr. Mcfadyn.
2,What?,"I saw this book while I was on the computer and gave it a try. The characters have the same persionallity half of the time, cold but caring. It got old. It just wasnt a book I could get into. I dont sugest reading it."
3,"very neat, boke easy","I had gotten this a number of years ago, fun color, functional, wish it lasted more than a month. The part that holds the knife in place does not hold it in place anymore opens in pocket...has been in a drawer ever since, I think it is under warranty but I dont know how to go about doing that."
2,"Good tool, Dangerous design flaw","I would give this TEN stars if not for a dangerous design flaw. I love the thin needle nose plier head.BUT, when the pliers are used, you can get a *VERY* severe pinch of your skin in the palm of your hand that can draw blood. The design is such that the handles meet/touch without a gap to prevent a blood drawing pinch. I own three other Leatherman multitools NONE of the handles meet/touch they all leave a gap to prevent this problem. That is why I call it a design flaw.THis tool is good, but the pliers cannot be used safely."
3,Tommy James Live at the Bitter End,"I was somewhat dissapointed in this disc with the sound. It is weak and empty in spots. The song list could be improved also. All and all it sounds like it did in the day, so I can't ask for anymore from them.It could be that I expected more sound after watching the new ""Queen and Paul Rogers dvd"" and that isn't fair.I'll watch it again it might grow on me."
4,neat story line,"unique story line. go figure, raist the darkie showing whitey .. (dont want to spoil, youll figure it out)"
5,A good read!,I love Dragonlance a lot! This trilogy was not as interesting as the first one Cronicles. however it was very good. If you like Raislin and the story of him searching to gain more magical power than this is the trilogy for you. A must for Dragonlance fans.
5,Life Album 1997: A year in Pictures,I loved this album. Over time you forget what happened in the past. This was definitely a good year and well done. I enjoyed the colorful pics and stories. History is so amazing! Thank you.
4,Great Multi-purpose Opener for Arthritic Hands,"I have used this tool to open jars, lift pull tabs, and cut through packaging. Hopefully the soft rubber material will last. It does keep my hands from hurting and opens jars easily. I would buy it again."
2,"Not sturdy, broke easily","I bought the green version of this at Crate & Barrel and while it opened jars easily and was nice to also have the bottle opener and bag opener handy, it broke really easily within about 2 months of owning it. Very disappointing."
4,Very Handy,"I purchased this from a different site but this opener has come to the rescue on many occasions to pop the cap off of a bottle and especially to open those really tight jars. Its been the muscle in my kitchen for over a year now. Gave it 4 stars because it does show wear and tear over time. I don't know if it's all the jars I've been opening but the top edge looks as if its cracking. Well, I did get a lot of usage out of it...and when it goes, I'll be back for another!"
2,Broke within 4 weeks,This thing works great but its easy to break it at the top pivot point and there is no repair possible because it needs to pivot at that point. Glueing is out of the question. I am going to buy another one because it works so good and be really careful with it.
3,Beautiful video enhances basic principles of Feng Shui,This DVD shows you only the basic of Feng Shui. That's the goal of Dummies series. The beautiful video does help you easily understand the basic principles. It will leave you wanting for more. You'll have to read books on this subject to satisfy your need.It's worth buying.
5,Great learning toy,My 1 year old loves it. It does not just teach shapes but matching colors also. He loves the sounds when he puts them in. Thumbs up to the educational value but a bit pricey.
5,FUNNY !,Christmas is here and i love watching these kind of movies.I watch this every year.It's an excellent movie.I love the plot.Now my sister even watches it with me.
4,fun for parents too!,"I thought this would be another movie my son would watch while I read my book. I was wrong! It was so cute and funny, I couldn't help but watch and giggle with him. It is light-hearted fun for the whole family, we still laugh every time my son says, ""sorry, I'm nervous!"""
3,Much better than the previews showed it to be,"Watched this film last night on On Demand, kind of a last blast of Christmas Cheer. It was much better than I expected, will watch again next Christmas. Don't know if the DVD has extras or not. The price of approx. $20.00 is kind of steep for this type of film. No need to go over what the other reviews have covered. However, watch for Terri Garr in a small role."
1,Big lie! Poor quality with material of chemical fiber,"Three weeks ago, I ordered the Extra 40% Off Super Soft Baby Alpaca Wool Reversible Shawl Wrap Cape sold and shipped by Great Gift idea Etc from Amazon. After I received it, I find its material is chemical fibers but not 100% pure natural alpaca wool as described on the Amazon internet and the label on them. This is a big lie! The chemical products are not worth of so high price.And also, it is difficult to return it because you should make sure your returned stuffs can be received by Great Gift Ideas Etc (not in US, address is Suite 11-B, Ave Gonzalez N31-55 y Gonnessiat, Quito, Ecuador) within 30 days. Anyway, if you want to buy it, think it over!"
1,Do not buy this if you like GNR,"This CD is not a tribute. It is techno and GNR was not a techno band. The bands that play on this CD are not techno bands. The songs are crap and this is a worthless, waste of time and a HUGE dissapointment."
2,The 16 sec clip of the new GNR song is better then the CD,"I heard a 16 sec sound clip of the up coming GNR song for the movie ""End of Days"",That 16 sec clip really is better then this whole cd... I like the song ""My Michelle"" on this cd thats why i gave it 2 stars,but its not the same with out Axl...this is a suppose to be a rock cd and its not that at all.The people singing sound like thay dont know what thay are singing about...Axl lived his words this is just some ones idea of a sick joke..."
1,Ummmm....yeah......,"Even though I'm fan of all the eighties bands, there is no way in hell I'm going to support this garbage! Whoever produced this cover album needs to stick to their day job. It makes all these bands look and sound bad!"
1,[Stinks],"I really wanted to like this disc, but I really didn't. It was an utter disappointment, even for a GNR and Jizzy Pearl fan such as myself. Wow, I mean, this was so bad, it could literally make you paint the walls with your lunch."
2,Rather an insult than a tribute!,"You should only buy this album if you want to dance to an ""Erasure-like"" version of Sweet child of Mine on your next party!"
4,"Comfortable, easy to put on, but not enough support for broken ankle recovery","I am recovering from a broken ankle and need more support than the Futuro Sport Deluxe provides. After the cast and walking cast, the Orthopaedist put me in an Aircast hard brace (two of which broke within 3 weeks but that's another review). Now that I've been released from the doctor, I wanted to give a soft brace a try. I am probably going to have to go with something along the lines of the Active X in order to get the support I need but overall I'm happy with the Futuro. It's fast and easy to put on, comfortable with shoes and a great price. I'll hang on to these and try them again in a month or so."
2,Very disappointed,"Have owned this for two years, and I'm kicking myself everyday that I didn't pay the extra for the bosch with the excellent reviews. The blade falls out every other cut and I'm not even sure why, sometimes the whole quick change unit falls out and has to be reinstalled."
4,nice jigsaw,"This jigsaw is well built and fairly well balanced. The motor on mine gave out at about 11 1/2 months but no problem - it comes with a 5 year warranty and there are service centers all over (even in RI, which can't be said for alot of other major brands).Someone mentioned there's no variable speed at the trigger. This is true but who cares? Maybe with a drill you want to start off slowly, but with a saw, if you start off slowly, you're gonna splinter whatever your cutting. And anyhow, the speed adjust wheel in front is unbelievably simple to use.Overall, this saw is a great value for the money. Especially with the outstanding warranty."
4,a solid collection of songs featuring Celly Cel,"This is a solid collection of songs featuring Celly Cel that have not appeared on his own studio albums. Here is a more detailed track listing:1. ""Time 2 Play""- 4:042. ""My Tip Toes"" feat. Levitti- 3:593. ""L.A. to the Bay"" feat. WC, CJ Mac & Homicide- 4:034. ""What U Hustle Fo?"" feat. Baby Bash & Don Cisco- 4:215. How I Roll""- 3:456. ""Get They Wig Split"" feat. B-Legit & C-Bo- 4:087. ""The Only Way""- 3:588. ""Shoe Strings"" feat. E-40, Mugzi & Kaveo- 4:239. ""Pop Yo Collar"" feat. Rappin' 4-Tay & Big Ton- 4:1710. ""Tramp Delite""- 3:5611. ""We Bring the Funk"" feat. Mac Shawn- 3:3612. ""Beware of Those"" feat. E-40 & Bigga Figga- 3:5413. ""Struggle"" feat. B-Legit & Araphoes- 5:2214. ""Bay Riders"" feat. William Floyd- 4:14"
3,Something important is missing,"While I enjoyed many segments in this rare treat something important was missing. I can't understand that the director didn't include interviews with important students of the 16.Karmapa, Hannah and Ole Nydahl.Not including them seems to me that he takes a certain stand in the following ""Karmapa controversy"" about the recognition of his reincarnation. For the uninformed: there are 2 candidates. Hannah and Ole Nydahl were his students who spent considerable time with him and would undoubtedly have contributed invaluable memories about their beloved teacher. They were not just listening in but have transported his teachings to the West and continue to do so. (Hannah passed away in 2007)Lama Ole continues to this day to travel the world, teaching and creating Buddhist centers. He founded Diamond Way Buddhism under the spiritual guidance of the 17. Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje and Shamar Rinpoche."
4,fun and challenging,"at first this game was to confusing so i didnt play it but lately i have been playing it and it is great. its fun when you figure out how it works. I listened to the tutorial a second time and now i understand it. Just give it a second chance it is quite fun and different, kindof like age of empires only with ants and bugs and stuff, for those who like difficult strategy maybe think of this game."
5,Extraordinary account of WWII combat,"The Black Devil Brigade is a personal story of the First Special Service Force in World War II. This brigade consist of US and Canadian commandos fighting in Italy. At first I was not overly impressed with this book. The grainy photos and primitive maps are substandard. Moreover, I encountered errors in the manuscript due to little or no professional editing. More importantly, and in light of historical research, there is the lack of a table of contents. Despite these shortfalls, and problems notwithstanding, the extraordinary personal recollections recorded in this hardback makes it one of the finest overall personal and oral narratives I have ever had the pleasure to read. I recommend this book to all serious students of history, or any reader in search of an extraordinary story of warfare."
2,dissatisfied,"I ordered this book, used, even though there was an unfavorable review. I have a number of Peterson books and like them all. The Mexican book is the exception. The one I received was from a very old edition, had incomplete illustrations of many birds, making identification difficult to impossible, and did not picture many birds found in other Peterson guide books. It is the worst. The reseller did ship the book promptly but I did not pay attention to the edition date and was unaware that there was a later edition of the book."
3,"Its okay, but not that easy to use","Overall this thing isn't bad, but it sometimes is tough to get it set on the can properly. I usually struggle to get the blade in the right position before I can open it. I used to have the B&D Spacemaker hideaway, and I never had this kind of trouble."
5,Safety!,"This fall, my daughter will be attending college in a relatively large city. The college has a good safety force, but still, assaults have occurred on campus. While I have preached the importance of not trying to use the small knife to defend herself, I have also stressed the importance of walking with this in your hand and whistling it as loudly and as often as she can while screaming for help. The scissors, etc, will I am sure come in handy as well, especially the nail file. But nothing beats knowing she has the whistle to call fr help if she needs it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Cool concept, but the hardware doesn't work. To count steps, the device depends on its internal pendulum (a weighted switch) to bounce for each step you take. However, the pendulum in my unit frequently stuck and thus stopped counting my steps. First used it on a 3.3 mile course, but it calculated that I had walked 1.0 miles. I walked the course again but carried the unit in my hand so I could feel the pendulum clicking; when it stuck (every few hundred feet), I had to shake it - sometimes quite hard - to start it working again. That time, it showed I had walked about 2.5 miles. Since I had to concentrate on the unit rather than my walking, I shelved it. I'm very disappointed with this product."
4,Track your walking!,"Pretty neat - very easy to setup and get going. Be sure to enter accurate data. I found it simple to use and easy to keep track of my walking. The only complaint I would have is the case for your belt is easy to come loose, I find myself constantly checking to make sure its there. I think it could have been made a little more secure."
1,H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E,"We've got Valerie who lacks spines and is very uninteresting, drab. Then we've got Gabriel here, king of the snakes and brujo, who is an oversexed macho seducer. Valerie generally seems to look down on all the inhabitants of New Mexico, very WASP. The one exception is Gabriel, whom she lusts for. Not very original. The whole story is a dragged out love affair between them. It tries to have a plot but doesn't. It keeps on going on about the wonderful sex they're having, and how much they lust for each other, but it doesn't contain much else. There's no point in reading this. Plot? None. Characters? Not realistic, nor interesting. If you like books of this ilk, fantasy-romance, I'd advise you to instead go for Laurence Hamilton's Anita Blake series. It's much better than this thinly veiled porno book."
2,good but been done before,i heard the album and it is one i would buy. but the style has been done several times over. time for a new scene to pop up .
4,"Target, cease fire!","Panzer III & Its Varients is THE book to buy about this German Tank of WWII. All of the models and varients are captured- the prototypes, production tanks- in many excellent scale drawings, cut aways and photos.What makes this book so excellent is the quality of the photos and line drawings. Everything is covered in a single source- hull, chassis, powerplant, suspension, turret, armament, armor, equipment- it's all there.Two minor irritants, first is that many of the line drawings have not been translated from the German orginal. Secondly, many of the photos & drawings about the Sturmgeshutz (self propelled gun varient) are duplicated in Spielbergers work on the Sturmgeshutz.An excellent work, a valuable collection to anyone's collection, highly recommended."
5,Spirituality Beyond Religion,Charlene finds God within herself and writes about the experience. A great book on the blessed effects of Sai Baba's Love & Grace upon Charlene's life.There are many wonderful teachings given to us through this book. I found it very difficult to put the book down.
4,Artists Journals and Sketchbooks,"The strength of this book is it's visual orientation and scrapbooking quality. It is rich with examples of different treatments of subject matter. It doesn't really address journaling for conceptual development, but there are other books that do this so I don't think that is a weakness."
3,"Not my favorite, but not bad either","I did not find this book horribly inspiring. Although many of the pages were absolutely wonderful, this book did little to excite me. I will keep it as an occasional reference...there were a couple descriptions and different techniques I may try. Not bad, not great."
3,SOOTHING.,"Although I highly recommend the L'occitane precious protection cream and emulsion (gave each 5 stars). The eye balm is just...""ok"". It is very soothing but doesn't seem to do much for wrinkles around the eyes."
4,Stranger on Horseback,"Thank you to company to release this rare western. The quality is ok, a few parts show to be aged , but overall good. The movie itself reads straight from the Louis Lamour story. Recommend to see at least once."
2,depends on major,"The tapes are definately helpful if you don't know the basics of studying and notetaking. However, the stress is on mindset and being alert and quick to review while your mind is still fresh. I found the tape full of information that could be benificial at a high school level, but applying it on a college pre-medical curriculum did not work because some courses are about working hard and smart, not just smart as the tape teaches you how to do."
4,A Diamond in the rough,"I've been following the progress of this game since early February and to see it be released is a great joy for me. The game ultimately is fun. From being a tanker, a trooper, a pilot -- viewing the accurately modeled country side, knowing that the road your walking on or the town your fighting in really does exist across the sea's is a high all it's own. Like any game on the shelves right now, it's not without it's fair share of problems either. Some players are reporting Crash's to Desktop, other are reporting Connection to host lost problems -- in the end though, with performance patches and feature updates this game will grow from my four star to easily an 8 star. The Naval portion hasn't been released yet -- but is expected to be released soon enough.Overall. A great game with even better potential. A definate buy."
4,A must have for online war gamers,"This game promised to have it all and it just about does. There are bugs in it as almost every PC game these days however the company is working on patches everyday. This game has it all, squadrons of aircraft, men, ships, and tanks..all fought in first person on an enormous virtual battlefield that is half scale of Europe. The only reason I give it 4 starts is simply because there are still many bugs to stomp, but I highly recomend this."
1,"Has potential, but is barely playable","The concept is great. Unfortunately, the reality is that the game client is big, slow, buggy, unstable, and the graphics are poor. I could live with the poor graphics, in fact I was expecting them, but the playability just isn't there. It takes forever to load, uses ridiculous amounts of RAM, and once you get in the game it's hard to tell friend from foe.Also I wonder if anyone beta tested this game. It seems like there are some pretty basic bugs that could have been fixed prior to release. For instance, if the install path for the game has a space in the name (like Program Files) you can only play offline. The fix is to uninstall and reinstall to a different path. Also the game hangs on launching under Windows 2000 unless you rename a particular folder so that it doesn't try to play the intro movie.After 6 more months of patches this game might be worth the money."
1,be prepared to be frustrated,"This game is horrible. The box for this game lies about the system specs. I have 256 megs of ram and a T1 line, which are both insufficent to play this game. I have talked to other players online and they said that for the game to run smoothly at least 500 megs of ram are needed. Plus, the game itself has graphics of a snes game and consist of nothing but tank battles. It takes about ten minutes for the game to load and sometimes it takes thirty minutes to find where people are actually fighting. The most frustrating thing about this game is the fact that a joystick is required and it says nothing about that on the outside of the box. So using a plane or a tank is not possible."
3,It's early but it's not looking good.,"For fans of fps's, I definitely recommend waiting. Trust me.1. The game WAY exceeded the sales the production company thought. This means you must download a 65mb + file from online to update it. So if you use a 56k modem, hopefully you know someone with DSL and a burner. 2. It is not your standard fps. The gameplay is more like Everquest than quake or HL. 3. It costs $10 a month to play. The first month is free. This I actually think is a good thing. It will at the very least weed out the idiots who ruin online gaming by being idiots. 4. The registration serve went down because of the overload and an ""incompatibility"" issue. 5. The game server is down and at the present moment (6/8/01 5:35pm EST)the most people that have played so far is 600. Again, the servers had an ""incompatibility"" issue.So wait till they fix all the bugs. Wait wait wait. Be patient. I am as excited to play a working title as much as you, and I already own it."
4,If you're a quaker go somewhere else,"This is not about fragging, this is a game for the mature gamer, it is for the player that don't play games for the eyecandy but for the pure gameplay.Imagine picking a mission and then jump on the truck at sunrise, close in on the front hearing the sounds of cannons and machineguns fill the air, see the burning tanks as you get to the battle, enter the town on foot your, while enemy tanks, planes and infantry try to stop you, take the town and get ready for the counterattack as the sun sets, you really feel that you are part of something huge.It is also nice to play a game where the development team cares.I would give WWIIOnline 5 stars, but there still are some problems, some people can't get the game to run and some features are still missing, but it is the first of the next generation online game and it is going to be though to beat.Personal glory is funded in teamwork."
4,A Great Game....In a few months,"This is truly going to be the game you love to hate. First off the reports are ture, there are some major problems with the game. I have a AMD 650/ 352megs Ram 32megs video card...and a Dsl Connection. If you have anything less then this I would forget it. I can play fairly well. A lot of the features used to promote the game arn't even in the game yet. That being said, the game is a hoot. I play for hours, even with all the problems. My advice is to wait a few months to get it, and forget what the specs say on the side of the box..you need a powerful system to play this one."
1,BEWARE!,"This item isn't described well!There are 2 kinds of DVI cable. One (this one) is a DVD-I. The other is a DVD-D (for digital only). Most computer video output cards use the DVD-D. This DVD-I one WILL NOT WORK for most computer and modern LCD monitors!IT WOULD REALLY BE NICE IF THESE DEALERS WOULD STATE THIS CLEARLY, even though one does mention it within the fine print. Pretty Tricky... By the time you open the obnoxious bubble wrap, it's yours..but feel good because these merchants will one day run out through selling them to us dummies, then there will only be the DVI-D, and we will all be okay. The dealers are unloading them without a honest attempt to let you know they will not work, and at the price it's not worth sending them back. SLEEZY PRACTICE!"
4,Globalaza,"This is one of those relatively rare friends that marry minimal techno with sharp electro. This is another fantastic cd that should be listened to in its entirety, not as single tracks in an attempt to find the gems. It has great pace and a logical progression of tracks that really need to be savored rather than just added to your list of music.This is an acquired taste that won't appeal to everyone, but for the real fans of detailed and innovative techno, techhouse or electro, this is a must for your collection."
2,Pfaltzgraff Yorktowne Tray is Melamine (Plastic),"I will still use this tray, but I was expecting a ceramic tray, not a plastic one. Now I won't have to worry about breaking it."
2,Doesn't quite fit,"It almost fits my Black and Decker HCC100 Home Cafe coffee maker, but severely binds when I try to close the lid. I am going to try to identify the points of obstruction and make it fit by carefully filing plastic as necessary."
2,make your own pods,"Why spend so much money on specialty filters for your one cup coffee pod maker. I purchase ordinary unbleached coffee filters (small), then measure the amount of coffee I like to use into it. Then I twist the top of the filter tightly, tie it off with a cotton thread, then trim the top off. I then put it into the coffee pod drawer and make my coffee! Works every time!"
3,Okay substitute for Senseo pods,"I ordered these because I like to save money and I had some good coffee beans that I wanted to use in my Senseo. The MyPod/coffee grounds combination is a little messy; so frankly, I prefer the pre-prepared Senseo pods and won't use the MyPods on a regular basis -- too much trouble. However, I am quite satisfied to have a suitable substitute and effective way to use other types of coffee in my Senseo machine. So for that reason, I would purchase MyPods again."
1,Crappy locks. No support. This sucks!,Installed the crossbars last week. Went to move them and the locks are rigid and won't accept the key(s). Piece of crap. I would look eslewhere.
2,"Well, I'm not so sure......","I read all the reviews, discounted the negative ones because of the type of praise given by the positive ones. I will have to admit that there is SOMETHING amiss in this recording or rendition! I've played it through twice now and STILL haven't heard it all, what's with the sound here? The choir had been singing 5-10 minutes before I knew there was a choir, there were previous tracks I could only faintly hear. I finally turned up the volume and started from the beginning, OUCH! Let's turn it back down! Oops, too low, let's crank 'er back up! OUCH, back down! This is the first recording, of my hundreds, that I have had this type of sound problem. You might want to consider the negative reviews."
4,It moves slow....but makes up for the pace,"THE STORY: Two Russian soldiers are taken hostage by a small Chechen establishment. The idea was to trade them for the POW son of one of the Chechen men.WHAT'S GOOD: The soundtrack is amazing. The filming is simple, raw and honest. This is not a special effects war movie. It's a story about friendship and breaking down barriers between people that technically should not be associating.STANDOUT CHARACTERS: The young Russian soldier does a good job of being innocent and naive..The girl who plays the Chechen Dina..she's memorable. Hasan, with his tongue cut off by the Russians, somehow makes up for the fact that he has no audible means of communicating.WHO IS IT FOR: Not for people who can't follow subtitles, and knowing a little Russian helped me when all the words were not translated. Definitely not for anyone seeking a high paced, blood and guts war movie."
3,Well Done Slice Of Life,"An interesting look at war and an area of the world that most of us will never see in person. Good performances and nice location photography on obviously a fairly low budget. The story keeps your attention but it's a little slow paced at times, still worth the visit. I don't speak Russian but found the English subtitles easy to follow.A Russian friend viewed the film as well and she enjoyed it. Her only complaint was that much of the Russian language did not always translate well into English or didn't have the same meaning as was coming up as English."
2,Modernization creats confusion,"Although I have throughlly enjoyed other more traditional adaptations of Hamlet, I was lost by the over modernization. When placed in the steril, artsy setting the charictors seem to be over dramatising trite inconviences or playing a continous joke bon those gulliable enough to believe them."
1,The Worst Adaptation,"There are just some actors who just shouldn't potray the lead role in one of the world's best loved plays. Ethan Hawke is one of them. I've been exhaustively studying the play Hamlet for years and never have I come across an adaptation so poorly done. The movie lacked in emotion and sincerity...it sounded more like some bland read-through of a scipt during rehearsal time. Perhaps the best portrayal done was by Julia Stiles in the role of Ophelia, but even that was not at it's best. This is a movie that would make true Hamlet fans cringe."
2,"I wanted to like it, but....","I am very open to modern reconceptualizations and all that, so I really wanted to like this version. Unfortunately, I thought the acting was really lacking. Ethan Hawke in particular sounded like he was reading all his lines for the first time - no spontenaity or ownership. Occasionally, that worked for Ethan as sort of a disaffected angsty thing, but often it was just unconvincing. Liev Schreiber was an acceptable Laertes, but for my money it was Sam Shepard who outshone everyone else in his tiny role the ghost of Hamlet's father. As for Kyle McLaughlin, he was ok; I'm just happy to see him working these days."
5,wonderful - Ethan Hawke is amazing,Had to watch this movie for a Dramatics class. Great version of the actual play. Ethan Hawke is instrumental in protraying Hamlet. Beautifully done. :)
1,"To Yawn or Not to Yawn, That is the Question.","This is the absolute worst Shakespeare adaptation I have ever viewed; it was so horrid, I could only watch 45 minutes of it before I took it back to BlockBuster.The acting (?) was pitiful; Ethan Hawke meandered about the screen in what looked like a pointless daze. Claire Daines spent 90% of her camera time in an open-mouthed, slackjawed stupor, apparently attempting to garner an Oscar for Best Fly-Catching Performance. Bill Murray acted like he was still singing in a lounge on Saturday Night Live.If you can even get past the acting (?), there's the problem of the story - as in - where did it go? Quite a bit of the original storyline seems to be missing, making the title of ""Hamlet"" to be one of major deceit.Save your $3.50 and rent the Mel Gibson or Kenneth Branaugh version and let this one collect dust mites on the shelf."
5,Excellent choice for graduate students preparing to work in schools,"Dr. Lisa Aronson Fontes has written a unique and extremely helpful book that is a must read for anyone who works with children and families. I had my graduate students in school counseling read and discuss the book this past year and they found it to be extremely practial, enlightening and applicable to their work. It really engaged and challenged them and sparked an extremely rich and useful dialogue. I have been looking for a book like this for some time now and I am thrilled to have finally found a well researched, compassionate and clearly written book which speaks respectfully to the complexity of these issues."
2,Not Credible,"I believe that the thirst for oil will eventually lead to an apocalypse but not because of the reason Ruppert claims, but because of turmoil in the Middle East that upsets and restricts the export of oil. In any event, Ruppert has some thoughts worthy of consideration intermingled within a lot of unsubstantiated conjecture presented as fact. As a sidebar and given Ruppert's self-proclaimed credentials, his often use of vulgarities during the interview is a decided put-off; a truly educated man does not need to resort to gutter language to express his emotions on an issue -- in fact, the emotion displayed (including the tearful breakdown) causes the viewer to question Ruppert's stability and therefore his grasp of the issue, his research, his conclusions, and, finally, his credibility."
1,All about michael!!,He thinks he is some special person with the CIA always trying to recruit him. How do we know this is true?
3,One perspective,"It is worth seeing, but offers a very limited perspective. His views on peak oil are good, but it needs to be added to other possible and intertwining reasons for an economic collapse."
3,It only takes one spray to be illegal.,"I saw this item, thought ""hey, I can impress my friends with this!"" and bought it. Well, the item itself is decent. Quality sprayer and very fashionable. However, DO NOT TAKE THIS TO A CLUB! I was at a local club when an undercover cop saw my spray this into my drink. Immediately I had my legs ripped out from under me, my head hit the bar, and I dropped my martini. I dragged from the club with beers and martini on me, a horrible headache, and everyone pointing and laughing. Turns out, he thought I was spraying an illegal substance in there but later found out it was nothing. He then offered to buy me a drink to make up for what he did, but I refused. I think he was trying to trick me into thinking he was my friend. Makes a great birthday gift!"
4,A good start to a big question,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book doesn't have all the answers, and that Lane often spends too much time pressing the same points. That said, Lane supports his conclusions well, and presents his central message clearly. For someone without much philosophy background (i.e. me), Lane's discussion of the trinity of ultimate goods was valuable and instructive. To recently graduated students: this is book is a great reason to use your alumni library privleges."
1,Vianix SASO Digital Voice and Audio Management System,"I am extremly disappointed with my purchase. I do not recommend this product to anyone. I am also very disappointed with the seller who sent me a used product as a new product. I have been trying to get a refund, but he has been giving me grief and run around and trying to presnt his faulty product as a good product."
1,"Retarded UI would be ok, but the units fail repeatedly...","I have to give Aprilaire engineers an award. An award for worst engineering effort since the square wheel.I have gone through maybe 3 of these units, and every six-nine months their internal firmware bricks the unit up, so that it cannot be upgraded or updated or reset or reboot or anything. From reading other reviews, others have experienced the same thing.Tech support from Aprilaire was good initially, but the guy just stopped responding after I kept coming back with the same failure.Bottom line: stay away from Aprilaire, stay away for sure from this 8825.Aprilaire engineering: you suck. tear up your AA degree and apply immediately to McDonalds."
2,camera bag,The camera bag in the picture looks wider than the one I recieved. The one I recieved is narrow and tall which my camera will not fit into.But as for all the rest of the things that came with the bag they are ok. So the picture is miss leading.
3,A Great Gift,This was sent as a gift.... a perfect gift for any Die Hard Dylan fan....It came greatly appreciated and I enjoyed listening to it myself when visiting!!! Should have purchased two sets!!!
5,The orange Juice is sweet,The Juice S2 is a good utility knife for basic electronic maintenance. Love the color too!
5,It really works!,"I've had a gopher problem for a few months now, and being an animal lover, I tried another friendly way of getting rid of my gopher. How? I bought a dried blood powder mixed with chili powder stuff from a local store. Did it work? No! I begged the gopher to leave. I even suggested he move over to my mean neighbors yard, but he wouldn't go. Finally I decided to buy the Black Hole here after seeing such positive reviews for it. The trap was easy to set up and didn't require any bait. It worked the first try! It broke my heart to have to kill the poor little gopher so I said a prayer has I placed him into the trash. I think (hope) he was the only gopher, but if he's not, I'm sure the Black Hole won't let me down again."
5,Best Dang Trap EVER!!!!,"Easy setup, neat, easy ah.. disposal of target, trapped 6 gophers the first week! Safe, non threatening/macabre. Set the trigger up so that it is easily tripped."
5,Skeptic says IT WORKS!,"I have no problem sharing life with the gophers and moles on our five acres and would never use poisons, but after years of losing flowers and bushes in my gardens we'd had enough. My husband ordered two Black Hole traps even after hearing complicated stories of placing the traps correctly for results. Oh my gosh...Four days after receiving them my husband has caught ten critters! Wherever a new dirt mound appears he finds the hole in the middle of it and simply places the trap in, with about a quarter of it showing (that way he can see if it's been sprung). Being an animal lover I appreciate the instant-kill aspect, so thank you, thank you, thank you."
5,Dream Catcher,The trap works great better than other ones on the market. We finally figured out that we had to put a rope or chain on it and nail it down. The stray cats take off with the trap to get the food out of the trap. Then under the house and it disappears. We found it two days later.
2,It works but not like it should.,"We used to have a pampered chef sprayer and it worked much better than this thing. The lid has separated from the plastic pump part. But more annoyingly, the spray is like a jet spray from a fire hose not a nice even mist like the pampered chef kind."
1,Not good at all!,"Perhaps my expectations for this produce were too high. I was expecting a fine mist similar to Pam Olive Oil Spray. Not the case at all! I filled the bottle half way and pumped it up a few times. When I sprayed it, a sloppy half mist/half spray came out. It also went all over the bottle. I tried different variations with more oil and less air and vice versa. No dice. Also, when the bottle is pumped with air, the lid will not stay down. This was a complete waste of money. I'm sticking with Pam Olive Oil Spray until I find something better. [...]"
4,Very useful!,I bought it for my wife and she loves it!It's very convenient and filled up with the quality (and expensive) olive oil we use allows us not to waste it as we used to; it's not on sale here in Italy where I am sure it would be a big seller.
5,Love It!,"Since cutting butter out of my diet, I have been using olive oil to grease my pans. However, I do not like greasy/oily food so I prefer a thin coat of oil. I had tried several other methods of spreading oil out in the past, but they were all messy and/or wasteful. The Misto solved both of these problems by spraying a thin, even coat of oil over all my pans with no mess!The only problem I had when I first got it resulted from filling it too full. At first it would only spray a few seconds before sputtering but as the level went down it worked better. I learned to only fill it half full and it has worked perfectly ever since. I have not had any issues with clogging, but I am going to take other reviewers' advice and depressurize it after each use from now on.If you cook with oil a lot I highly reccomend this product. And mine will easily pay for itself by eliminating all the oil I used to waste!"
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,It takes a lot of pumping and a lot of spraying to do what a pressurized can does in a few seconds. I use spray oil on dry popped popcorn. It didn't work out for that. I'm sure it's fine for other things.
4,Great value!,It will be a necessity!It saves you money on oil because you have control over the flow of whats coming out...very economical!
1,Stopped working after just a few uses!,"Save your money. I thought it was a great idea to mist on olive oil on pizzas, pasta, bread, etc. You fill the canister and pump it up a few times and spray it out just like a can of Pam Cooking Oil. However, after using just a few times, I never get a mist. Just a lame squirt of oil, regardless of how much or how little I pump the cannister. What a waste of money! What a waste of time! If it cost me $2.00 then I would expect it to break after just a few uses, but for $.. I want the stupid thing to last at least a couple of years."
5,Great,Works like a champ and it a great help for greasing baking pans with olive oil - wish I had bought the 2 pack
4,Excellent kitchen tool,"I wanted to find an olive oil sprayer to save money on Pam sprays and to have more control over what I put in my food. When I first took this out of the box, I was concerned because it felt cheap (I don't know why this surprised me - it clearly says ""brushed aluminum"").I have used this both to spread oil on bread when making grilled cheese and to oil a cooking sheet when making homemade fries. It worked great for both of these things. I am very pleased and recommend this product."
1,Product does not work,Received this item as a gift. I could never get it to work correctly. Leaks constantly and does not mist. Sent for a refund but still had to pay return shipping. Save your money.
4,works well but clogs easily,"it works so well when brand new, now about 1 year later the nozzle is now clogged. will buy another one again & try the suggestion of another reviewer of releasing the pressure when not in use."
1,Doesn't Spray,Bought one. After 10 days the spray turned to a stream. Bought a second one. After 10 days the spray turned to a stream. Bought a third one. After 10 days the spray turned to a stream. Three strikes and you're out. One star.
5,Great!,I'm replacing one that I bought 10 years ago. I used it all the time with no trouble until it finally won't hold its seal.
3,Misto oil sprayer,"The sprayer looks nice and works fine except while pumping it up, the insert in the cap doesn't stay in place and has to be reseated to continue pumping. A little spot of glue should fix this problem, but this should have been glued during manufacturing the item."
4,Awesome product for the price,I just received my Misto Spray and I love it so far. Its not been long but seems to work well. Very happy that I have moved away from all the propellants and silicones in store bought cooking sprays.
2,Ok,"Not the best. I had to really cram down on the spout to get a spray, otherwise it was just a single line of oil coming out no matter how much or little I pumped. After about a week, the plunger tore and it is now useless."
1,Utter garbage,"I heeded the reviews of others, to no avail. It doesn't matter if you release the pressure after each use, the spray nozzle will fail eventually. In my case, it failed after about six weeks of once-daily use. It's a pretty piece of junk, that's all."
1,Used item?,"I received this on time with what seemed to be ample padding in the box. The lid on the sprayer looked to be used. It was scratched up and ""dinged"" in several places. We thought about keeping it, but I finally said we needed to return it. I don't know that a new one would look this bad after we would have had it for a year. I wanted to just exchange it, but that was not an option, so i'm having to return it for a refund and buy another. We found this for the same price in our local Publix shopping center the day after we ordered. Looks like we'll be shopping locally."
1,Not worth the money,"I am very disappointed in the performance of the Misto Sprayer. I like just a light mist of oil on veggies or for baking. This sprayer needs constant pumping and delivers dribbles of oil. It's a real chore to get it to work properly and not worth the time, effort and mess it makes."
4,Solid performer,Gave this as a gift and the recipient said it worked very well. Supposedly this is the best make out there!
4,mist food sprayer,"They work great for now, did have to glue the pump tube to the lid so they would stay together. One I use for liquid smoke and the other one has seasoned wok oil. just a few pumps and I get an even spray."
1,Awful,This product does not work and its mist is more of a sputter! Not just that after using it there was oil all over the sprayer area of the bottle so its messy to handle. Complete waste of money!
4,Great Misto,It works great! .. as advertised.Saves oil and uses so much less to get the same job done = healthier!PLUS .. so many more uses that you wouldn't have normally done with pouring oil out of the bottle.I highly recommend this product.
3,Didn't work as I'd hoped,"I had high hopes for this, I can't have much fat in my diet so I figured this would help me cut out some. It is tough to spray. I only filled it half way as other reviewers suggested. It sprays uneven and gets stuck often. Not pleased, just ok."
3,Its OK for the $,"I bought this as a replacement for an older Misto. Old one was metal and heavier. New one works OK but its more plastic, not the same quality. Last one lasted 10 years. We'll see on this one."
4,Useful,"I think it doesn't spray like a can of spray that you buy, but you can't beat it for the health benefits. It keeps you from having other chemicals put in with your oil and it does help restrict the amount of oil you use when cooking. But I also bought one for my father and he finds it bothersome to get going with it and easier to go to old habits of just pouring the old out of the oil container, and I have to admit, I tend to do the same thing even though this wonderful item is sitting right in front of me."
3,"Impressive kitchen gadget, but not necessary","This is much more elegant and environmentally friendly than disposable olive oil aerosols, and you can use it with whatever kind of oil you prefer. The major trade-off is that it takes a lot of pumping action to get a good spray. As others have pointed out, you should fill it half-way for optimal spray; as this is a large device, that's still a lot of olive oil, and you'll have to use it up more quickly than if it were sealed in a bottle.Buy this device if you need to dazzle guests with aerated olive oil, or if you absolutely must coat a pan evenly, but be prepared to sacrifice some convenience. Squirting oil from an ordinarysqueeze bottleis far more convenient."
4,really great,"I had been looking for something like this because I wanted to add more oil to my cooking but I didn't like the idea of pouring the oil into the pan. This is the perfect way because you just pump up the tension and spray what you need, whether it is to coat a pan or to coat some bread for toasting. A really excellent purchase."
1,mine broke too... not worthy of a single star.,"apparently, these are great when they don't break. mine broke after 3 uses. i won't be buying another.i was forced by the rating system to select a rating in the range of 1 to 5 stars, inclusively. i can't imagine how something that breaks immediately earns a single star.i certainly didn't get my money's worth. of course, i had tossed my costco receipt, so i couldn't get a refund.:-("
3,Work for awhile,"This item worked for awhile then it stopped cold. It would not even pump, but it did look pretty.I bought a cheap plastic one from the A&P; and have had it for a few years now without problems,got my moneys worth already."
1,Broken after a dozen uses,"The product worked well when it was about half full and now the unit does not work at all. When it is pumped up it just squirts a stream, leaks pressures and the button does not seem to be working correctly. Since it was bought as a gift in early December I can no longer get a full refund. Its not worth paying for shipping to send it back. Very disappointed with the product and Amazon."
2,started leaking,"worked for 12 months, then started leaking. It needs higher pressure to atomize the oil to really do the job.I am using an airbrush with a small compressor set to 50 psi. works great."
3,Good for a little while,"It works great for a month or two, but then the spray just becomes a thin stream. Still usable, but not quite what you want.Tip: Don't fill it up past 3/4 otherwise it won't be able to presurize right."
2,"After two times,it broken!","It broken, and I opened it.Eventually I found the spring is plastic!!!so I cut off the broken spring and chenged a metallic spring ~~~It just works....So, if you do not want to fix something ,you'd better do not buy this one......"
1,broken,"I bought two of these items, one for oil and one vinegar. I realize there is no warranty on these items but the fact that I've only had them less than three weeks and one has failed, I find utterly ridiculous. The spray nozzle does not work."
1,"Junk -- great, until (both) broke","This was great until, after 2 months of daily use, the plastic pump broke and it would not fill with air. Same thing happened with the second one I bought. I emailed the company to inquire about replacement parts -- never got a response. Like reviews said, it produced a fine mist. But it's just not meant for regular use."
5,Great product,I love the Misto. Now that I have it I put EVOO in it and use it all the time. It's great!
1,"I try to be positive in everything, but...","...while thing started off well with the Misto sprayer, after a very brief time it just fizzled completely (no pun intended...). What initially was a fairly nice spray of olive oil (still dribbled a bit, but generally OK) has morphed into a steady stream of drippy, runny oil.In addition, this thing smells terrible! I guess that may be my fault, but I was unaware that olive oil would turn rancid after a little while. Call me a dumb guy, but who knew?In the final analysis, this was one of my worst Amazon purchases. Good thing it was less than ten bucks!I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this turkey."
2,Meh.....,"I've had it a couple months, worked fine at first, but quickly started having issues with it not sealing properly. So you'll be pumping it for pressure and the top will fly off other times, you'll pump forever and it will barely work. Oil all over the place. Looking for my replacement now. $10 good price, but you get what you pay for in this case! Bummer!"
2,Idea is good even if no longer so new,"The object is badly and cheaply realized. I already shared an image where is possible to see the internal plastic part of the cap that came-off at the second pumps.Another problem is that part of the oil is 'sprayed too thin', more then spray it you atomize it, so that the atomized part is too 'light' and 'stay in the air' instead pf your food, and eventually fall off the dish and you can even breathe it!I had one I bought in Italy that was half the price of that one but worked well for 2 years, so no excuses, that works wrongly because it is cheap, cheaply done not cheap in price."
1,Really works,Product works fine if you only fill it 1/4 to 1/3 full of oil and release the pressure after each pump up.
1,Shop around for another brand,"We have had two of these already and both eventually failed. Usually the spray evolves into a stream, and then the plastic spray mechanism, which seems very cheaply made, totally fails."
1,Not that good -- Misto,Misto M100S Gourmet Brushed Aluminum Olive Oil SprayerI bought this to replace one that I had for years from William Sonoma. The Misto spray didn't even last one year.
5,My favorite!,"I bought mine at a store, b/c i did not know amazon had them, but I LOVE this, u can put any type of oil, I fill mine with high quality grapeseed oil, u just give it a few pumps and spray on your salad or on a pan, and u use very little amount! This is one of my favorite kitchen items that I own, Highly recommend! I have owned mine for 2 yr it is high quality and looks great too."
5,A treasure of a book,"While this book may be about 40 years old, the recipes contained within are timeless. They are delicious, contemporary even for now,and easy to prepare. Grab a copy of this book if you can!"
4,Bad Shipping,The product works great but when they were delivered one of the two bottles were broken and leaking.
1,overpriced,"the product itself works great and was shipped and delivered within 1 week.however, this is only 64 ounces ... 1/2 gallon. if you are purchasing for home or personal use, you are better off ordering the 1 gallon version, which is cheaper than the 1/2 gallon!!! even if you are reselling this stuff, it would be cheaper to buy the 1 gallon."
5,Meguiar's G7164 Gold Class Car Wash Shampoo and Conditioner,"This worked just as described. I would recommend using a couple gallons of water with your mix of Meguiar's for an SUV sized vehicle, especially if you use the recommended wash mitts. It cleaned well and rinsed off easily."
2,Telarc not up to it's usual high standards on this one.,"I have been buying nothing but Telarc from the days when they started from the 33.3 half-speed masters to the CD age. They were always forthright in listing the audio components used in there recordings and always produced the best. They were the first in using DAT for there masters. What happeded to you Telarc? Get too rich too fast?? The 5.1 DTS Surround Sampler is nothing more than old music recorded to a new format and can never be better than the origial masters? If I did not already own a DVD-A player , this DVD would not covince me to. Even the ""Gladiators"" sound was better thn this!"
3,Average booklet for gardening,"This was an inexpensive booklet. It was good for basic information, but the information was basic enough that it could be found in any other type of Herb Gardening book. It's not something I will reference very often."
3,Great concept but TYPOS!,"I just wrote the following email to DK Books about this book:We got this book for Christmas and have used it a lot. My kids (aged 7 & 5) are able to do everything themselves now except turn on the oven and the stove, which Mommy does. But still, there are some typos in the book that are frustrating my kids. There is a recipe in the book for ""fruity tarts"" which definitely has errors in it. It calls for only 2 TBL of butter, which is impossible! You can't make tart dough that way! But what is the correct amount? My kids have been increasing the amount every time they make it (we are now up to 8 TBL) but the tarts still don't turn out. Can you tell us what the right amount should be? And if there are any other typos in the recipes, we'd like to know aobut them too. Otherwise, we love the book! We've made just about every recipe except the soup one.Peace and goodRegina SchmiedickeCaleb, Rose, Marygrace, Joshua"
5,Richly deserving of praise,"This really is a great album. By the way, there are no vocals, in case you're new to Pelican. To me, that's a good thing: the truly beautiful guitar work can really shine without the distraction of forced lyrics or drug-induced ramblings.Speaking of which, what's up with Amazon's Editorial review? Maybe I haven't listened to City of Echoes in the right *eh-hem* state yet, but I'm definitely not getting the whole pile-of-elderly-heat-stroke-victims vibe from it. Just sayin'."
3,"Okay, but Pelican can do better!","This cd was kind of a letdown for me. For people that are new to Pelican I wouldn't recommend starting out on this album because it's boring and predictable. The sludgy riffs are Pelican's signature but they don't vary much from track to track. I didn't like how Pelican shortened all their tracks on this cd either. 90% of Hydrahead's music is better than most other stuff out there. This is just my opinion but this lacks the sparkle that ""Fire in Our Throats"" had and that Isis always brings to the table. I think Pelicans side band named ""Tusk"" released a stronger album than this one. Tusk sounds dark and dreary like Cult of Luna. I only gave this a 3 star because it's Pelican and they set the bar fairly high with ""Australasia"" and ""Fire"". I personally don't listen to this one too often."
4,Quality but needed quantitiy,"This is another great Frank Miller graphic novel, with plenty of good characters, excellent writing, wonderful art, and the greatest story line of all history; the battle of Thermopaylae. However, the book remains a bit short, each day (which there are seven)are no more than ten pages at max. I love long Frank Miller novels, and even though this isn't one of them, it's still a great read for any fan of history, war, or Frank Miller."
4,Interesting Historical Fiction comic,"If you like other Frank Miller stuff you'll likely go for this one also. Great art if you like this type of comic and a decent historical fiction portrayal/interpretation. Don't go basing your history paper on the story presented here, however Miller's version is likely a little closer to the actual ""gore of war"" than was presented in the ""clean"" movie (The 300 Spartans) it was based on. Personally, I wish Miller had based his book/movie on the ""Gates of Fire"" book by Pressfield; it would have been even better. It isn't politcally correct, but then it doesn't need to be. The spartans certainly weren't. For me, it was entertaining and that is the bottom line."
2,Interesting but curt like Spartans were supposed to be,This comic book is a replay of an ancient war in Greece. The director of Sin City intends to make a movie out of the books contents. Interesting read but it is over in 15-20 minutes and for the price I would take a second thought.
1,Terrain Twister,I bought this for my son and within two months it quit working. Do not put this toy in the water! I spent a lot of money on this toy and my son only used it a couple of times. The insides rusted out. I would not recommend this toy at all.
1,good enough to qulify for a toy like this,i guess it is ok but the most fun part is when it goes from water to land
2,battery issues with this toy,batteries are sold seperately and are super expensive over $30.00 plus the batteries only last an hour or so then you have to recharge for 5 hours. Kids cant wait that long to play with a new toy. at the $30 dollar price cant afford to buy a second pack. $80.00 dollar toy only worth $25 if that. dont spend your cash here look for something that you could actually keep your kids entertained with
5,Fast and Slcik,The toy is great and durable now me and my friends can play crash because of the way it's built.
1,It's a bilge pump,"Don't bother with this. If you want this same product, go to your local marine supply store and ask for a bilge pump. They cost about $30 and are the exact same thing as this. Don't buy this unless you like wasting time, money and intelligence"
3,Disappointing.,"There's a saying along the lines of ""Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't.""Paul Burrell spends over 400 pages describing innumerable instances in which he believed he served as Diana's faultless knight in shining armor. He repeatedly uses words such as ""heroic"" and ""discrete"" (!) to describe himself, which struck me as increasingly strange as the book plodded on. Also, Paul has a wife and family but yet states clearly that his loyalty was/is foremost to Diana - all day, every day.It doesn't someone who's studied psychology (which I have, I should add) to realize Paul Burrell (and Diana, to be honest) have some issues. Most likely, codependency.Don't read this book if you're hoping to learn a great deal about Princess Diana. If self-congratulatory butlers are your thing, though, this is the book for you."
4,Just read it,"I haven't bothered buying this before as I admit I was predjudiced by all the bad publicity towards Mr Burrell. Why I bought it now I'm not sure....but I am very glad I did.History as it was happening...and a peek into the privileged life in the Royal Palaces and Houses.Diana was no angel, she had major issues no doubt caused by being born into the very dysfunctional Spencer family, and Paul Burrell shows all facets of her of her character, but the love he has for her is a major theme of this book. As his story unfolds the actions of the Windsors and the Spencer's speak for themselves.My feelings now towards the author are now very different, he did what he could in very difficult circumstances, above and beyond the call of duty.I think Diana was truly blessed to have him as her friend, and we are so lucky to have this ""up close and personal"" chronicle of recent history.Thank you Paul"
5,An Honest Portrayal by a Truly Devoted Man,"Thank you Paul Burrell. You have written a wonderful tribute to a woman the world will never forget. Princess Diana was very special to many people. I commend you for your strong sense of integrity. You should feel very proud of this book. I will add this to my collection. As a reader of every single book ever written about Princess Diana, I believe yours is the warmest book I have read. I wish you and your family all the best."
5,Wonderful Travel Book,"Wonderful book. Took it with me to Honolulu ..and while I was on the beach it never left my side-fascinating story. Mr Burrell's honesty and loyalty are impossible to miss. He gives the first believable account of the Royals, their society, and an understanding of the complexity of the beautiful Princess Diana. His story is defintely worth reading!!"
3,Not impressed,"I was looking for a book that would give me a little more insight into Diana, Princess of Wales but it is an insider's look at the life of an employee in Royal service. Interesting, but not what I expected or wanted. Towards the end of the book, the author seems to be in the ""poor pitiful me"" mode which made finishing the book laborious. The photos are excellent, though."
4,similarities,I finally saw this last night and what struck me was a similarity in some ways with this film and a old film with Jennifer Jones called Good Morning Miss Dove a devoted teacher bought gifts for her students every year nurse in hospital was a former student and the story of the gift the girl remembers and both Hetty and Miss Dove told the little girls to wash first. The sudden need for surgery Very much reminds me of that old movie.Other parts of the movie where more original I thought the parts with Janet and Alex King missing the boy where good. I was also shocked about not mentioning Sarah even perhaps a christmas card from her. Would have like to see Gus and Jasper. Enjoy the actress that plays Hetty she was always great.
3,The Return!,"I was so excited to learn that Kevin Sullivan had decided to make a sequel to ""Avonlea""! I just saw ""Happy Christmas Miss King"", and was a little disapointed. Sara Polley didn't appear, eventhough the show was originally centered around her character! Zach Bennett had very few lines, and ""Gus Pike"" didn't appear either. Although it was nice to see how some of the characters developed, you can't expect that same old feeling to come back when all the old cast isn't there. I hope in the future, Sullivan makes another movie, but this time with everyoe in it. The series always had a charm about it, and for that ""may we be truly thankful!"""
3,All sizzle and no steak,"Eh. I really don't know what to say. I feel like the information in this book can be had somewhere online for free. Like it just seemed like a compilation of stuff, no real insight or anything like that. As I said, it's not what I expected so I give it 3 stars still because I feel I'm more at fault than the book is. Complaints about the actual book- I really feel this book could be about 30+ pages shorter. Half the pages have are almost half empty. Some of the pages are just unnecessarily huge pictures with a little caption and maybe a paragraph if that. I just don't get what's the point of pictures that big with nothing to expand on? To be honest if I had the chance to do it again I would not buy this book, luckily I got it used so I didn't pay too much."
3,Fustrating,Story is very frustrating - main character is do involved in himself and his need for self indulgence he misses what is really important. Seems his entire family is caught in their own personal hells.
5,Sick Twisted Unreal I Liked It,Story of Ari who is torn between several worlds and in reality he's being torn apart. He doesn't know if he's coming or going throughout the whole movie but you know what it somehow hits it dead on like it's real life. Worth watching over and over again! Not to stereotype but this should be on the movie list of every gay individual out there as they will relate to this movie because it actually caught the lifestyle most gay men live when they are younger like Ari and also what they feel inside. Most individuals will relate with this film in one way or another.
1,Very Disappointing!,"This was definitely not entertaining in any sense of the word. So negative, in fact, that I wondered what it was trying to achieve. The premise of a 19 year old dealing with his sexuality, family culture, and resulting self-destructive behavior seemed like an interesting start. From there, the movie drags us through the character's unbelievable encounters with grungy men, an equally unbelievable encounter with police, other idiotic misdeeds, boozing, drugs, and violence. In the end, we are left with a repulsively pathetic loser. This seems to do little more than promote a dissuading stereotype."
3,The Half Breed Book Two,"Don't let the three stars keep you from reading this book; I think I am a little cheaper with my ratings. Book two was an improvement over the first book in my opinion and is a nice story of the romance between the illegitimate son of Tom McBride and an Indian girl. Chase is a Texas Ranger who has been summoned back to the ranch in Sidewinder like the other legitimate offspring.The romance and action with Faith and Chase was sweet and I loved the way Tuner and Callie accepted them into the family.As always the evil step mom figures into the story, but we can only hope that she gets her just deserts or has to bake cookies for all of the grandkids by the end of the series! She is a character that you love to hate.Bobbi Smith had not been one of my top authors, but surprised me with a nice piece of work."
2,A wonderful coffee table book (but I would stick to Janes),"If you are looking for a wonderful coffee table book that you can show little children so that they can ooh and ah to, then this is the book for you. This book has nice pretty pictures, which are not very accurately captioned, and it printed on very nice paper. However, for a more serious review of the history of Warships, I strongly recommend that you discard this book for a doorstop and rely more on the Conway's series (All the World's Fighting Ships). Conway's is for the serious historian. Chant's book, and Chant has written some fairly good books on military subjects, is only for show but not for tell."
2,A bit deceptive... But good otherwise.,"While its description says its heavy duty it is probably more suited to casual use. I work in a factory where I use my knife for 8 hours a day. I bought this knife with the hopes that it would stand up to a normal shift. After just two days use the thumb nub got extremely loose on the first one. After a replacement, the second knifes thumb nub broke completely off. I noticed that they are screwed on and the screws become stripped. To tighten the screw you have to rip up the rubber pad to get to the screw which would create a whole new issue trying to reattach the pad. While the knife is heavy duty on the whole it is just frustrating when the comfort features fail. I plan on trying to reattach the nub before sending it back to see if in the future it will make a useful product."
1,"horible, no lo compre si gusta de la buena musica latina","natalia oreiro es una joven actriz, que a raiz de un exito en tv en la argentina, se ha dedicado a cantar. Es bonita, indiscutible, pero cantando es realmente torturante. No se puede rescatar nada de ninguno de sus cd, que pueden hacerlo sentir enfermo o romper su equipo de audio a los 5 minutos. Si tiene ocasion de verla por tv en algun show comprobara que baila (?) casi tan espantoso como canta. Este tipo de pseudocantantes le hacen mucho daño a la imagen de la riquisima musica de nuestra region."
1,"someone rewrote 1 and 2, for the most part","its just more of 1 and 2, most of it, you can figure out on your own, a few useful things perhaps, other wise there are other things to spend your money on..sean fielding smithusmc"
5,Outstanding!!!!!,"Great Product. My lady turned me on this this stuff and it's really great. I had been suffering from itching dry skin before I started using it. Now that's a thing of the past. It even cleared up three arera on my body that were giving me trouble. One application last at least 24 hours. I like it so much, I started a monthly subscription with Amazon for three two packs a month. Only problem is I didn't need that much. Three tubes a month is about all I need. This stuff may not be cheap but it really does the job. Highly recommended."
4,great product and last a long time.,This cream is great and our baby loves it. The 14 ounce tube last a long time. We use it everyday.
1,Not so good,"If you are a fan of Bally-K, like myself, skip this series. There were people i didnt even know or knew how they arrived at Bally-K. The priest was ""off"" too.Ballykissangel - Complete Series Six"
2,See-Through Paint,"This paint is gel-like, as other reviewers have said. Think of it like the gel frosting in the little tubes - if you spread it out at all you can see right through it. When I bought finger paint for my daughter,I was remembering the type from my childhood that was more like a cross between tempera and paste. I will keep looking."
1,Not Washable off clothes and carpet,"This paint is terrible! I don't know what they meant when they said it wash ""washable"" My kids spilled it on carpet and their clothes while painting and the stains NEVER came out. I have used steam cleaning, industrial cleaners, and numerous stain removers to try to get out...I am left with ruined carpet and clothing.I have thrown this paint in the garbage! Do not waste your money!"
3,"Okay, But Do Something!","It was entertaining just for the sake of reading something. Georgina spends the entire time justifying her relationship with Hugh which in the last few pages of the book realizes the truth for what he is. Too bad, I would have liked the author to further develop George's reaction to Hugh in the end and the birth of the baby. The birth of the baby would be more meaningful than ending on such disappointment from Hugh."
4,One of the best graphic novels on Magic: The Gathering,"This is the second attempt at comics based on the Magic: The Gathering game world (The Acclaim series was discontinued in 1996). In many ways, this is the best drawn and most interesting one. The story is about the adventure of Gerrard and company as depicted in the M:TG Tempest card set. Unfortunately, the book has not gained much popularity and it remains the only title in the planned series."
4,good book,I bought this because it was highly recommended as a must have for the software engineer. I browsed through it and I'm not sorry I bought it. It has some good stuff.
2,poor format on kindle,"I bought this book in papaerback and I thougt it was OK, not great but I have been slinging software for forty years mostly on mainframes so very little is totally new, I then got a kindle version and I am really dispointed since the charts and graphs are pretty much useless and cost of the Kindle version is high compared to other books (I have 290+ kindle books). I cannot recommend it."
2,Hm.,I think I would have preferred this book for the Kindle. The information is great and highly recommended but the production of the book itself is shady. The spine is cracking and coming apart and I feel like the cover isn't going to last through my first reading. I don't abuse books so I'm disappointed by the quality of the book itself.But I'm definitely not bothered by the CONTENT. As a newbie I find the information valuable and worth owning.
5,Great Book,"This is an excellent book. And our town is very supportive of Diane. I know who she is, she lives in our town of Meeker. Diane is a great auther and she has done an excellent job writing this book. Its definitely a book that you are not going to want to put down."
3,love and the single.heiress,The book was a pretty good read. The story was a but weak but all in all a pretty good book.
4,Great addition to the Rat Zapper,"The Rat Tale is designed to be used with the Rat Zapper Ultra. It plugs into the top of the unit, and flashes whenever the trap has been activated. Since I had my Rat Zapper in the back of the attic, it was a big pain to go up into the attic every night to check the trap. Checking the trap a lot also discourages rats from entering it if it is constantly moved. The Rat tale has about a 12 foot long cord, and I was able to let it hang down from my attic (see picture). I kept looking up at it every time I came home, which I later found out was unnecessary since this thing flashes like crazy when it goes off. The LEDs are very bright so, there is little chance you will not notice is. I recommend it for anyone who plans to put the Rat Zapper in an inconvenient location."
4,Works well but battery is difficult to change,The Rat Tail monitor works very well with two different models of Rat Zapper I own and it sure is nice not to have to crawl into the space where the Zappers are located to see if there has been a catch.I only gave it 4 stars because I had to replace the battery on the first Tail I purchased but couldn't get the battery compartment to close up again. Frustrating. But I like the product so much that I purchased a replacement rather than not have one at all.
5,Will order another,"This little Remote Monitor is a ""have to have"", for us at least. I've got two rat zappers and they work great, but they are in locations that I have to remember each day to check. With the little Rat Tale Remote, all I have to do is walk in a room and it tells me if we've caught a mouse. It works great and will be ordering another so each rat zapper has it's own little remote rat tale."
4,Great for the car,"I got this toy for a toy for the car, and my daughter loves playing with this toy in car."
2,A few problems,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old. There were a few problems with it. 1) The plastic is hard! He has clunked himself in the face a few times and it left a mark! 2) The keys don't stay on the link very well and 3) My son likes to teeth and bite on the white part that the music comes from. Problem is is that when the saliva goes into the holes where the music comes out from, it warps the music. At first I thought it needed new batteries, but the toy was wet on the inside and it speeds up the music and singing and sounds like Minnie Mouse on helium!All in all, not a very well thought out plan for a toy! :-("
1,Too Clunky,This toy is too clunky and hit my 6 mos old in the head when she was playing with it and she cried. It's hard to clean too as I shorted out the music by accidentally getting too much water into it.
2,Learning Keys,THe keys all fell off so now there is just the push button box left. My son plays with it but it is not a whole lot of fun. I think he just likes it because it makes a noise when he pushes the button. A short noise.
2,Didnt work for us,"it was too big on my small frame and my son's head wasnt well supported. It was akward to put on and I couldnt see over it! I am not that small, 5'6"" and 120lbs... I dont like it.. I ended up getting a Infantino Spft Carrier instead."
4,Use it all the time,"I would recommend this carrier to anyone. I have no problem with back pain or the carrier not fitting and I am small framed(5'4""). I use it mostly with my baby on my back since I use it when I work and it is akward to work around my baby. Both my babies still fit into it and I can be comfortable for hours. My only complaint is that it is falling apart. The stitching is actually pulling out! I won't replace it since my youngest baby is not far from walking and I don't use it often for my older baby but I wish it would have lasted longer because it is so great. I have had it for about 19 months and used it at least 2-3 days a week. It was impossible to use during the last 2 months of my pregnancy w/baby #2 but my husband used it alot as well."
5,Snugli Front & Back Pack Carrier,Fast Delivery Positive communication. Great transaction. Highly Recommend!
2,Not for us,This carrier was not for us. It was awkward and difficult to use. My son was not comfortable in the carrier either. I exchanged it for the model below and love it! It's super easy to use and my son loves it!
3,tough to get on but its quality will last for a while,"he hates getting in it and i find the side attachments difficult to use with such a heavy child and the adult buckles are basically all in the back this makes it difficult to attach with only one person but, once in he seems so nice and secure and goes to sleep almost instantly."
3,Not So Good,"I bought this second hand thinking it would be a lifesaver. I used it from the time my daughter was 2 weeks, and it never worked properly. The straps are hard to adjust, especially since her father likes carrying her. Her body also did not seem to be comfortable in it. It could be an older model that I have, but I was unhappy with it. I bought a Baby Bjorn second hand (for much less than $90) and I'm thrilled with that. I also bought a handmade sling and she absolutely loves being in that to nap. It will also last much longer, as the Snugli is only good up until 25 lbs and a sling can be used as a back carrier."
2,"interesting enough, but dragged on","Just finished Skull Session last night and was very disappointed in the ending, well, actually the entire story. The information on the mental disorders was informative, but the story lacked good characterization and dialog. The dialog was stiff and too formal - who speaks like they are constantly referencing a thesaurus and psychological texts? Seems way too forced. I just couldn't get into the disappearances and murders, or Paul's relations with his family. I was thoroughly disappointed and found myself just trying to get through it just to get through it."
4,Great Read,I picked this book up on a whim & found it to be outstanding! After the first couple of pages I found myself hooked. I too found myself researching the condition to further validate the author's story. Unexpected ending was a great twist! Editing was terrible but looking forward to his next novel!
3,Great story,"Daniel Hecht is a very talented guy. Skull session is a very good story with terrific development of characters who a reader will wish he could continue to know when the last page of the book has been turned. It's no wonder that Hecht went on to create the Cree Black series beginning with his ""City of Lights"" as with so much effort having gone into bringing characters to life, they may as well go on for a few books.Skull Session is an interesting story with a predictable ending. A great deal of scientific information is offered throughout and with Hecht's occasional slips in presenting this information one can't help but wonder how much of what is offered is erroneous. For example (Daniel), one cannot smell tannins in red wine. Tannins don't have an odor.But be this as it may, the characters became real, the story was exciting and it's one darned good first novel by my standards. Keep writing man!"
5,Which is better,MHz is the Short form for Megahertz and it in not a power measurement. all it is is a way to run them both at the same time. it is in the antennae of the vehicle and the controller
3,Confused by ToyrUs,"I bought mine and haven't used it yet. I tried to take advantage of ToyrUs sale (buy the twister and get the battery for free) But all the stores never recieved any (no rainchecks) Seems misleading to run an ad with no merchandise in stock. I'm giving up on this store, seems more bait than anything else. I'm sure the toy is going to be fun for my child [...]."
1,It's going back.................,I will help fix the out of stock problem. Mine is going back to the store. My 5 year old and 8 year old wanted no part of this.I tried it and felt the same way. Not what we expected.
1,Batteries required,"I can't rate this toy because my son can't play with it.I don't know what people are talking about when they say that the box tells you the flex pack is required. Read the box! It shows a picture of the flex pack and battery and says in plain english ""batteries required."" I don't watch kid tv so had no idea what in the world a flex pack is. Is it a battery? I was very mislead and now two days after Christmas my son has not even touched is only Christmas gift because there isn't a flex pack to be found in any store."
1,Misleading Order Information,"Upon finding this item on the internet I placed an order. After doing so I saw it needed a rechargeable battery pack which I also ordered. Upon receipt I wrapped the items together for my child for Christmas Day. On Christmas day we sat down with our child to put this all together and go outside and try it out, only to find out that the battery pack Amazon offered to go with this item is THE WRONG ONE. How dissapointing can this be a new toy and not be able to use it. Just think how you would feel receiving a new car and not get the keys to drive it home."
3,"Good, but was missing a part.","My son is 3 1/2 and I thought this tractor might a bit too small for him. The size is actually just right. As for quality, it passed the ""Dad"" test. I am 5'8 and 185lbs, I sat on it and paddled on it. Nothing broke or bent. Quality is definitely good. The instructions are not so good, they are also in German! The one thing that kind of pissed me off was that, it was missing a part. It was a part that hides part of the steering column. Nothing major, but I expect every part to be there."
4,Kettler Cat Kid Tractor,"A bit more complicated to put together than lead to believe...just be patient and READ the instructions!! But, our little guy loves it and that makes ""some assembly required"" worth every frustrating minute it took to get the final product!!"
4,Great for little excavators,"This tractor is an excellent toy. It is very durable and can handle anything my son throws at it. I love the fact that any child will be able to use it and also grow into it as they get older and bigger. Assembly was a little tricky due to the fact the none of the directions were in English(they were in German). Take your time putting it together, the diagrams are very good and should be enough to get it done. A must for any boy, or girl, who loves ""big diggers."""
4,Loads of fun!,3 year old loved this for his birthday. Turning radius could be better and it is difficult to assemble with included instructions. Overall very satisfied.
3,i guess it's ok,"Well, I'm one of the odd ones I guess who isn't blown away by the book. It's ok. I've only had it a short while and made two dishes + pastes. They were good, altho not mind blowing and actually some of his instruction is quite vague. The curry dish didn't look anything like the photo i.e. thick, chunkey, very red. Mine was light pinkish, not thick or chunky. I know my way around the kitchen, especially with Asian food, so the jury is still out on this one. In the meantime, I'm checking out other books on the subject."
3,Product Not in New Condition,"My daughter loves the PowerPuff Girls and I had ordered this for her as a gift. The product had several scratches on it and did not look new at all. Plus, the battery was already dead and it did not work when we got it. I had to buy a new battery on top of the purchase. I needed by a specific date and didn't have time to return it so, we just kept it."
5,very satisfied,"I got this product December 26, 2006.and it is still same as first time I got.and it was $23.it look also good.I do love it. If it is $23, worth it. but now $40"
2,Leather cleaner and conditioner,"I used this product on my vehicle's leather seats. (1998 Aurora) It didn't do as good of a job as I had expected. I didn't notice much difference in the appearance after using it, and my seats are just a touch on the slippery side now. The scent isn't too bad...not overpowering or ""smelly"". :)"
5,Amazing conditioner,"I use this on my leather seats and it leaves the seat feeling soft and smooth, I also have used this on a leather jacket that I foolishly sanded to try to wear it in. On one spot of the jacket the leather was completely ruined, once I applied the conditioner it was like it never happened. I couldn't believe the results. I've also used this on a leather holster that's 60 years old."
4,Nice conditioner,"This is a fantastic conditioner -- but a cleaner, it is not. At least, not more than surface dirt and dust. That, however, was fine for my purpose (new leather with nothing more than some surface dirt). It goes on easily, smells great but is not an overpowering scent, and leaves the leather looking nice, dark and clean without any ridiculous shine or slippery feel.I didn't really find it difficult to apply, but it may be a little messy. I just dedicate one cloth for application, do the whole car, and then use another 2 cloths to go back around and wipe up the excess. Takes about 15 minutes on my Nissan. I still prefer Lexol for cleaning and conditioning, but this is a great product for monthly application to protect against UV exposure, which is what I am looking for."
2,says cleans vynal,It didn't touch my boat seats!!! a little mold and dirt... try tylex tilex( sp) worked great!! rub maguiars on after (maybe) I'll update after summer!
4,Great Service,"I recieved the product, and one of the bottle tops were loose. Some of the wax had leaked out. I contacted the seller, and he replaced it with a full bottle of the product. He gave me great service with no questions, and that is something you don't see very often. His service to me was outstanding."
5,My brother and I really love it!,"I first see this Mandrake Linux PowerPack Edition 9.1 on my brother's notebook. Together with my brother, I found it so flexible and durable. It can recognize MOST plug-in peripherals so easily without any problems. Since my brother works in an IT company, we both agree that Linux is THE BEST choice for us. Even, my old Linux 2.2.6 performs far better than the leading brand OS, especially in networking. The best of all, it is cheaper but performs far better than the leading brand OS. If you need a durable, flexible, compatible, and dependable OS, try this Linux!"
1,THIS ISN'T THE NEW ONE!!!,"We made the mistake just like everyone else thinking this was the new version. We actually hunted it down at Target, bought it, opened it, put it in and finally realized it wasn't the new one until it got to the movie. WHAT A TRICK!So, we shrink wrapped it and took it back :)Don't make the mistake we did! What a trick! ""Let's re-release a deluxe version at a high price because the new lorax came out"" What a scam"
2,Bad Product presentation,"I purchased this video expecting a full length movie. I discovered that it had a run time of 27 minutes. I plan to keep the dvd, but I will be more cautious about my purchases through Amazon.com."
2,Terrible,"I had to buy the flick, so there was no way for me to ""Rent"" before I purchased via Amazon. If you're kids liked the book, then I guess they'll like the visual effects. I'm thinking the new one coming out will be 1000's of times better."
4,UNLESS...,"As a child I loved the Lorax for the simple rhymes and laughed at the comical little Lorax standing up to the might of the Once-ler. I think from the standpoint that it is fun and interesting ryhme ranks it right up around the four stars mark because it got young children to read.As an adult, I find the stance that the Lorax make for accountability to be a valuable lesson that adults can relate to children in explaining this story.What I really like and thought it was well conveyed (despite the very dated background music and the liberal rewording to extend the poem) is that final stanza where Dr. Suess, through the Once-ler, lets us know that even with all the problems there is still a chance to better the world we live in but it will require great care and effort..."
4,So that's what it was called!,"I remember seeing ""Pontoffel Pock and His Magic Piano"" when I was very young (I was born in 1982), but haven't seen it in ages and the name of it slipped me for a long time (I always mixed it up with ""Oh The Places You Will Go!""). I remember being young and liking the magic piano with the colorful buttons--it was like a player piano--to escape, he would push a colorful button and would fly away on his piano as it played a fanciful tune. Wow.I am really well-versed when it comes to obscure Dr. Seuss cartoons--and I love them all. I had a boss several years ago who was a fan of the Lorax, but I haven't seen this one in years.Finally I figured out the title!!!! And I can remember liking this one. I would love to see it again!!!"
3,Making The Man,"I watched it and through most of it, It was ok, but I ended up bored. To each is his own taste.. I suggest you check it out yourself and decide what you think. I can be hard to please. I am a movie fanatic from the word go."
5,"Good Read, Great Storytelling","This book was a kick with some quirky characters and some scary reallife parallels to religious nuts today, Id read it again. Like Judgment Day by Jane Jensen and Michael Crictons State of Fear. Good for people in cults."
4,One of Alphaville's best,"... Alphaville is still playing the sort of electronically-oriented pop/dance music that made me so fond of them in 80s, although they do seem to have mellowed (and darkened just a tiny bit) with age. I recommend this CD to anyone who has fond memories of Alphaville's music.On the plus-side, stand-out tracks include ""Guardian Angel,"" ""Wishful Thinking, ""Dangerous Pieces,"" ""Pandora's Lullaby,"" and ""Wishful Thinking Physical.""On the minus-side there are some tracks that go on just a bit too long to support the flimsiness of the song in question (""Flame"" and ""Point of Know Return,"" and ""Soul Messiah"" are the greatest sinners as far as this goes).The good, however, far outweighs the bad on this CD, so in the end it stands as one of the best Alphaville albums I've heard."
1,Another AIDS gay flick,"If you've never seen a story about a gay man stricken with AIDS and a loyal lover in a tear jearker, then you may be able to tolerate this movie. Otherwise, if you're looking for a film with real sex, believable characters and plot, don't waste your time. The only redeeming feature of this film is the French sea town setting. The motivation for the straight diver's change of preference is totally absent. The presentation of the main character as more than a kooky, pushy companion is not convincing."
1,"Too idealistic, Too Simple","I found this movie to be incredibly simplistic in its ultimate message and its failure to fully develop the characters leave the viewer feeling unfulfilled, and in my case, extremely confused. The Man I Love immediately introduces that the main character has feelings for Lucas, the straight guy (I'm talking like in the first 5 minutes he is like I love you). Because of this hurried approach to ignite the love between the two characters, the powerful message in the end becomes undersupported. For Christ's sake the main guy has AIDS and chases after Lucas, who is struggling with his own sexuality. So, there are two conflicts occurring simultaneously. The amount of internal conflict paired with lack of character development (like the viewer doesn't get to know the characters at all, period, the end) causes the movie to ultimately fail in its purpose. Don't rent this movie, 'cause youll get a huge disappointment. Rent Burnt Money. It's awesome!"
3,"Good, but easily dirty","The bag was a good size, and cute. But the outside ""cooler"" compartment won't hold even the smallest sippie cup easily, making it difficult to grow with your child. Mine has rips and tears in it. Also, there is no real way to disassemble the strap (or any other part) to wash as it gets dirty... and it will, being so light in color."
4,Good singer. Good musician. Good songs.,"The songs are well composed, well played and well sung. But the instruments, especially the guitar and the drums, sound too loud compared with the voice. Perhaps reengineering could adjust this. I don't know."
2,Definately only for bored die-hard war- fans.,"This book was terrible. I had a hard time reading it, and that has never happened to me before. The language used made even me disgusted and proved how small the vocabulary is of Walter Dean Myers. It is about a soldier in Nam, named Richie Perry. Perry disgusted me because he becomes friends with the stupidest, most foul mouthed hick I have ever heard of. This red-neck was named Pee-Wee, a war-monger. I hated it."
5,A spactacular book! One of the best I've ever read.,"""Fallen Angels"" is a great war novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. This novel really goes deep into the devlopment of the characters and how the horrific experiences of war thrash them mentally and physically. This is no light read! It really goes into the graphic realism of war and will change your view on war entirely. This book will change your life for the better,and will also reveal how horrible, and yet trimphant fighting for your country can be."
5,Fallen Angels: A Must Read!,"I've read this book in the seventh grade and loved it ever since. We're already experiencing war as it is, and it is important to read anything about it, but this book shows how many Black men felt by joining any branch of military.Besides the narrator, my favorite character was Peewee (Gates). He was a silly person, but he really shown in the book the true meaning of friendship.There are many men over in Iraq and Afganistan right now the same age as Perry. This book will give more insight about what goes on inside their heads, even though this is fictional."
4,Fallen Angles,"Fallen Angles is a good book for war buffs.In the book is a lot of action ,comedy ,and sadness wrapped all into one good book.The book is based on a soldier in Nam named Perry.Perry struggles through hard times with emotion and even harder times during the war.Fallen Angles is a really good book I highly recomend it."
5,A Splendid Discussion on the Meaning of the Cross of Christ,"This book is written in an engaging style utilizing concerete stories of suffering, nonviolence and hope to illustrate the keen theological insights of the work. I found the discussion on Walter Wink's work and the nonviolent cross to be exceptionally clear for those who have not been exposed to Wink's work. I was very impressed by the feminist perspective that permeated the book that should serve as a corrective to hierarchial and patriarchial tendencies in seminary theological training. I hope that this book will find wide readership in the theological community and among lay persons."
4,Great reference especially if you're interested in churches and buildings.,"Very good general reference for people planning a visit to Italy. However, I found it a little heavy on the information regarding churches. One might get the impression that there's not much else to do in Italy except visit old churches and buildings. Practically every town listed highlights at least one church or monastery. Good value for the money."
3,A Mixed Bag,"First of all, Dixon created his book by using Wayne Barlowes idea for a similar book. Read The Alien Life of Wayne Barlowe and you will know what I mean. Dixon managed to include imaginative text, but lacked interesting looking post-humans, some looking embarassingly stupid. To say it nicely, Philip Hood was not the right illustrator for this book. It's the only field guide type book I have found on the future of mankind, so if you wanted a book of this subject you might find it entertaining, but if you want great artwork look elsewere. If it helps, the book is not centered on very futuristic post-humans, but ones engineered to repopulate the earth in an animalistic style. There are a few technologically advanced humans at the beginning and end, but are far outnumbered by the ""natural"" ones. As a final note, I think the book would have been far superior to what it is now if it had been left in Barlowes hands."
1,DO NOT FIT SONY CYBER-SHOT DSC-H3,The item description is not correct! The filters do not fit the Sony DSC-H3!
3,"Orangey bronze, not ORB",I received this and it seemed like good quality but the color is not oil rubbed bronze. It is more orange bronze so it was returned without any problem.
2,small problem,i was really excited about this grill and it's good but the only problem we have with it is the gas pipe keeps breaking it's done very cheaply so if you planning to keep it your right and thats it then it's perfect but if you are planning to move it around i would probably think again
4,Great Value for the $$$,"Just installed this over the weekend. Had all the proper wires and duct work been present beforehand, this install would've been a breeze. Fan and heater work perfectly but for some reason the posts for mounting the light are obstructing the bulb holder and I haven't figured that part out yet. Hint, hint, the instructions are a little lean on explanation. Confident I'll square the bulb issue away and I'm considering buying another one for the 2nd bath. The unit is a little loud but really, what are you listening for outside the bathroom when you're...indisposed? I typically don't carry on conversations between rooms when I'm using a bathroom. I like some noise. ;)"
2,INTRESTING,The dvd is great in regards to its high intensity but the instrcutor does not allow you time to learn new steps. She practically introduces a new step..you do it twice and then she adds on to it. If she allowed more time to learn the steps it would be great. Also it doesnt help that the camera shows feet and the back of the participatnts backs and necks when you are in the middle of trying to look at the screen and listen for ques on the new steps introduced to be learned in less than one minute. I just got it in the mail today and am looking on how to send it back for another dvd!
5,Courage My Love,"All of Merle Shain's books are balanced, insightful, tender overviews of the human relationship in its various guises. Why these books haven't gone into re-print is beyond comprehension!"
1,Not the same smell,"Cologne does not smell like the usual Jordan cologne I have purchased the last few years. It smells more like cleaning solution. It is a rip-off that we cannot return these kinds of items. The ""cologne"" could have been filled with just water, and I would not get a refund.What is strange is I have bought this product before in the past and it smelled just fine. I'm guessing their supplier must have changed."
3,IT was not as good as I anticipated,The plot of the story could was good. But the movie just drag ged on & in the end I was disappointed.
4,The Lovely Film,"Peter Jackson's adaptation of THE LOVELY BONES is beautifully executed. The movie is so rich in visual metaphor and surreal environments that it is breathtaking. The way the film is shot makes for an amazing play on emotions and tension. This film is almost poetic in the way it is offered. As a Christian, I must emphasize that the film's view of the afterlife is strange and not particularly Biblical. However, the film was so haunting that it has had me thinking of its rich landscape long after it was over. Saoirse Ronan's acting is absolutely top notch. Her portrayal is riveting and beautiful. Great film!"
4,The Lovely Bones,This movie shows that you can't trust someone even if it's a person that your parents interact with...this man was creepy!!!
3,Stunning and yet finally exceptionally disappointing,"While the movie is visually stunning, and Ronan indeed does give an amazing and beautiful performance as Susie, I was left thinking that this movie is as much based upon the book, ""The Lovely Bones,"" as the movie ""Simon Birch"" was based upon John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany,"" which is to say very, very loosely. It would have been better had Spielberg and Jackson given the movie a different title. The book, while not great, is a very good story. Unfortunately, the movie does a masterful hack job on the book, and what results is a one dimensional and not very interesting interpretation of Sebold's work. All the characters, save for Ronan's and Tuci's, along with their individual stories, are bereft of depth. If you've read the book, be prepared to be disappointed. If you haven't, enjoy the movie for the visuals. The soundtrack is also quite lovely."
2,Just Odd......,"I only knew a little about the premise of this movie. The movie started out ok, then became some sort of acid trip fantasy land that just didn't work with the supposed plot. The story bounces along to so many things that either don't make sense, have no bearing on the movie or are just plain odd. I think this would have been a better story if it had just focused on the family dealing with the death of a child ,sans the big color trip.. The villian was very unbelievable. The ending was a big let down. Susan Sarandon's role was weird. Not really sure why her character was involved.Overall this movie is weird. I didn't care for it."
1,"Terrible, pointless","I kept waiting for some kind of ""twist"" that would make the story come together and be more than a series of dreadful events. Bad dialog, bad concept of how people might act in this situation. It's just an awful, awful movie about nothing more than killing, with a touch of what another reviewer called ""New Age junk."" Hard to imagine anything worse. Mark Wahlberg should be more discriminating about the jobs he takes, he's better than this."
1,Watch if you want to be depressed.,"I am glad I didn't suffer through the book if it is as depressingas the movie. I wish I had been warned that this movie has noredeeming features and is as depressing as a movie could be made.I am only writing this review to make sure anyone consideringwatching this movie knows what is in store. A very, very depressingexperience with NOTHING at all in the movie tolerable.I only wonder why would anyone make or participate in the makingof this movie. I had a pretty good opinion of Peter Jackson before this movie. But, I can't understand why anyone would want tohave anything to do with this movie in any way.In case I haven't made myself clear: I hated it."
3,good but quite flawed,"OK; the acting was quite good, the screenplay compelling, the direction eye-grabbing and attention-getting. But the movie as a whole just doesn't jell. The main reason is what others have said; far too much attention to the afterlife and not enough interaction with the real world. It's never explained how Susie's father knows Harvey is the killer; it just suddenly comes upon him. Ditto her sister. They were major plot holes that really worked to spoil the film. Worth seeing? Yes. More than once? Doubtful."
2,DULLER THAN DULL,"Peter Jackson is anything but a good fit to direct this story, as his well-intentioned efforts at conveying transcendence sometimes look and feel phony.It's a great deal of effort by a lot of talented people that results in two-plus hours of tepid clockwork blandness. The cinematic equivalent of that big farm your childhood dog allegedly went to. ""The Lovely Bones"" is a skeleton of a movie, lacking any sense of life and vitality. When I read Peter Jackson was handling the story, I figured if anyone could do it, he could. I was wrong."
2,Wish I didn't spend the money for this one,"I hate to speak poorly of ANYTHING yoga, but this book was disappointing. Most of the vacations are expensive and are limited in number of times offered per year and length of instruction. I've seen most of these listed somewhere in a copy of Yoga Journal magazine. Flip thru one of those before buying this book. It may be better to talk to someone who's done the vacation package before spending the money. Namaste."
4,excelente disco,"Este disco es excelente. LFC continuan experimentando nuevas fusiones, y se afianza en este disco la presencia del tango, que ya venia de los Fabulosos Calavera,un muy buen disco, aunque algo oscuro y dificil de digerir.En La Marcha...consiguen plasmar las nuevas tendencias del grupo en un disco maduro pero con toda la fuerza, donde las canciones van transitando, a veces saltando, los diferentes ritmos, desde Piazzola a Mano Negra, pasando por el jazz, la murga, etc.El disco en general es muy bueno, con temas excelentes como ""Los Condenaditos"", un verdadero clasico,""La Vida"",o ""Vos Sabes"". Un discazo, sin duda uno de los mejores."
2,"Good music, but...","Jewel has to be the worst excuse for a singer/songwriter in the 1990's. Her first album was good, and I only stress GOOD, with some poor lyrics (""Pieces of You"") and some really brilliant moments (""Amen""). However, on ""Spirit"", Jewel tries to ""up"" her dull and depressing lyrics with some faster songs. Musically Ms. Kilcher has it going. Lyrically, however, she needs help."
2,Not good and too pop,"The only reason I gave Jewel two stars is because she looks cute and has a good voice at singing . But her songs are really too pop and makes you feel like shooting yourself . Her lyrics don't make much sense and real musicians who play guitar usually wear chains , play distorted rock and sings good with strong lyrics . Jewel's last album was also dissapointing as well . I think I'm attracted to her but her music is just flat"
3,"""Pieces of You"" was better","I know there has been a lot of hype about Jewel's newest release ""Spirit"", but personally, I find it rather dull. All of the songs seem the same, just different words. I really felt her soul in ""Pieces of You"" and it is one of my most favorite CD's, but ""Spirit"" is nothing like that. I feel strongly that she needs some better melodies. I still think Jewel is a wonderfully, talented lady, but ""Spirit"" to me was not nearly as good as ""Pieces of You"". I would like to see what her next album (supposedly a country one) will bring."
2,"Too much like ""Pieces of You"". RESIST !!!......","Basically ""Hands"" is all this CD offers (and perhaps one other title). The rest is Jewel plunking her guitar while singing poetry which becomes tiresome. When you have a message and decide to deliver it, over and over, with only one voice and one instrument: YOU'LL BORE YOUR AUDIENCE NO MATTER HOW FAITHFUL THEY ARE. I AM a fan of Jewels: I very much enjoy her voice and her songs ""Hands"" and ""Foolish Games"". I am disappointed in this album and sense that she focuses on expressing her thoughts & beliefs and demonstrating her 'intellect' so much that she is oblivious to what good music is, what she is capable of doing musically, and what we want to hear."
4,The Art of Maturity,"Several of the cuts off of ""Spirit"" have been included in live sets and will be instantly recognizable to her fans. But listening to the new single ""Hands"" is moving. The first noticeable redirection is the use of full instrument arrangements. ""Pieces of You"" was very sparsely arranged with several tracks containing just vocal and guitar. I believe this new dynamic will continue to solidify Jewel as a wonderfully talented songwriter, who truly has something to say. ""Spirit"" continues lyrically in a very poetic vein without sacrificing her mainstram appeal. This album is noticeably more upbeat with such lyrical proclamations as ""only kindness matters"". ""Spirit"" will be one of the biggest releases of this year. Don't miss it."
4,"good voice, good music, trite lyrics","Jewel is a very pretty girl (I know I shouldn't mention this in a review of her music, but ... hey she's hot!) who has a very pretty voice. Her music is well played, arranged and produced. The problem is 90 percent of the time her lyrics are air-headed drivel. She must hire a bunch of little junior-high school girls to write her songs. C,mon she lived in a van for chrissakes! If I had lived in a van I'd be playin' the blues, I'd be Robert Johnson, no ""we're all ok"" or whatever for me, nope, it'd be ""I'm livin' in a van, damn, ain't no life for this man"" you get my drift. Anyway, my wife bought this cd and if I tune out the lyrics I really like it, so it will probly end up in my collection ha-ha."
1,"Jewel, Jewel, Jewel. . .","Granted, it would be incredibly hard to follow up something like Pieces of You, but I was so terribly excited when I bought this album, and so terribly let down when I finally listened to it, that I just had to sit there. This was not the same Jewel I was listening too. Gone was EVERYTHING that had made Pieces of You such a good album. This thing put me to sleep, and left me empty. Spend your money on something else. Check out Sordid Humor's Light Music for Dying People."
2,Not as good as I thought it Would Be,"The reason I bought this C.D. was because I really liked Pieces Of You, and I thought Spirit would be mostly the same but even better than Pieces. I was so wrong! When you listen to this album it feels like you are listening to the same boring song over and over again. The first three songs are the best, but the rest of the album was lifeless and drab. It lacks the originality and heart that Pieces of You has. It is not an album I would recomend, unless you like monotonous, lifeless songs."
5,AMAZING,"I THINK THAT HER NEW CD IS AMAZING.. MY FAV SONG IS HANDS IT WAS FEATURED ON "" DAWSONS CREEK"" AND WHEN I HEARD IT FOR THE FIRST TIME I WANTED TO CRY MY EYES OUT... HER VOICE IS SO SOOTHING I AM HAPPY FOR HER AND HER SUCCESS..SHE'S SO AWESOME!"
1,Not Reflective,"I come to the conculsion that the reason that I do not like this album is because it is too perfect. Jewel strength is her live songs, wich some traks on POY were. She needs to put out a live album so that people can see her real talent."
3,Go back,"Jewel, you have a great voice, go back to the solo guitar, drop the band/commercial bit. You were powerful then."
2,Hype,"Alas, Jewel's greatest assets appear to be just below her neck, and little is made of them in the packaging of this otherwise boring ""If I could tell the world just one thing"" pretentiousness."
2,Check it out from the library,Maybe I haven't listened to the CD much--not the 1000's of times it would require to develop a taste for this album. At least the songs on Pieces of You were all a bit different. Spirit puts me to sleep because all the songs sound the same. But I give her an extra star for commanding her voice in a more mature way and for the professional-sounding recording.
5,IT ROX!! That's all there is to it,"This album is much better than her previous release, Pieces Of You, which was...needless to say...one of the greatest albums on the planet!!"
1,only two good songs on the album !,number 3 and number 5... amazingly disapointing.Is it still the same person composing ?
1,"please, stop.","This is inflated, simplistic, low IQ, aural wall-paper. What happen to driving melodies, complex lyrics, beats, rhythms, anything! Your all in a cultural COMA! Go buy Liz Phair's Exile In Guyville CD and snap out of it, for the love of God and John Lennon. music fan"
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz................,"I like Jewel, but his c.d is sooooo boring. The only good songs are ""Hands"" and the new single ""Down So Long"". I think she needs an upbeat rock album next..."
4,Pretty good,"Jewel's second is quite different compared to her first album. Her lyrics are simple and yet very hard hitting. This is a different and yet a good follow up to her first album,'Pieces of You.''Spirit' true to it's title is a very deep and spiritual album. However if you're looking for her raw, innocent style from her previous album, you won't find it here.Her song like""life Uncommon"" is a fine example of her matureness towards the world and to her beliefs. This is not an everyday listening cd, but very soothing and thought provoking."
5,"A Shining Jewel Full Of ""Spirit""","Jewel's follow up to her debut release, ""Spirit"" is an overall worthy successor. Some of the lyrics may seem contrite at times but still, Jewel carries this recording with grace and precision. Much of it is rife with very nice acoustic flourishes and her trademark delivery.I find almost every track noteworthy barring ""Fat Boy"" which rings a bit too maudlin to me. But the following don't disappoint; ""Hands"" the lead single, The nice understated and enchanting ""Enter From The East"", the plaintive ""Innocence Maintained"", the determined ""Down So Long"", the expressively folky ""Kiss The Flame"", etc. ""Life Uncommon"", ""Do You"", and ""Jupiter"" all hit the right notes as well.While ""Spirit"" may lack some of the raw intimacy of its predecessor, it compensates with more overall refined production and maturity. A good find."
3,My Jury is still out on this one!!,"This album has a few great songs like ""Hands"" and a few others but the rest seems to be just filling up time. I love Jewel and I think she has a great voice but her first album was much better. So if you want to buy a Jewel CD buy her first album. This one is somewhat disappointing."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,Juel's bored look on the album cover perfectly reflects the music it contains. Great for insomniacs.
3,"Jewels voice needs no help, but her lyrics do","Jewel's new album ""Spirit"" is pleasant to the ears but once again Jewel lacks the talent to write new and original lyrics. The songs lack the very essence of what seperates the mediocre singers from the great singers; lyrics. Jewel has made some improvements on ""Spirit"", the addition of a band and some new intruments makes songs like ""Hands"", and ""Absence Of Fear"" two of her very best songs. The major problem with ""Spirit"" is that many of the songs have similar lyrics and similar ideas, which can get sickening to the listener after a while. For Jewel to utilize her beautiful voice and reach a new level in the music world she will have to look deep within herself and write some original songs."
5,Jewel keeps making beautiful music!,"I have been a big Jewel fan from day one, when ""Who Will Save Your Souls?"" first hit the airwaves from ""Pieces of You"". Now she's done it again with ""Spirit"". She has a lot of critics who will try to tell you that her lyrics are trite and unimaginative, but that couldn't be further from the truth. More than anything, I think Jewel expresses honesty and compassion in her songs. Her unique, sweet voice combines with her thoughtful lyrics to make her songs pure joy to listen to. The well-known ""Hands"" and ""Down So Long"" are two of my favorites on the album, but three other songs that shouldn't be missed are ""Deep Water"", ""Jupiter"", and (my very favorite), ""Life Uncommon""."
3,Jewel-Spirit,"Often dismissed by critics for her high school poetry and tree-hugging persona, Jewel is an artist who knows what she wants, but cant seem to zero in on it all. As great and powerful as her post-van experience Pieces Of You album was, Spirit tries to do and say too much, falling on its face more than a few times. The first single ""Hands"" is hardly the ""Give Peace A Chance"" of the 90's, but its better than some of the other 4 minute life preservers Jewel throws out. The opener ""Deep Water"" is one of a few standouts that are more like mere appetizers before the big meal, which never is served. ""Down So Long"" holds too many folk/rock cliches, but its worthy of a few listens to make sure Jewel's earnest, childlike caring wasnt made for nothing. Spirit isnt a horrible album, but compared to Pieces OF You, it does sound like living in a van really hurts."
2,whatever,"i heard the hands release on the radio, and thought why not? big mistake. it was just as dumb as buying her book of poetry. seems like she tries much too hard."
3,"If you a fan its ok, it not stay away.","Cabo Blanco is an awful remake of Casablanca. U.S. Marshal is Bronson's guest appearance on the show of the same name. Chino is a decent western movie and worth watching. Man with a Camera was a show Bronson did in the 50s about a photographer that gets into all sorts of trouble. Like I said, if your a fan, go for it."
5,This Book Was Great!!!!,"Daughters Of Silence was a really good book. I reccomend it to anyone who wants a good scare. I think it sad that Simon and Angelica had lost their two daughters because of a family curse and all. But, you have to wonder, wil they ever be able to bring their daughters back from the dead????"
4,exciting!,"I LOVE Fear Street,it is UNREAL!!!...Unreal certainly IS the word isn't it??This is another very strange,very spooky,very EXCELLENT edition in this ..erm,imaginative..series!!"
5,A Trim Midsummer,"I just finished staging a production of Midsummer with high school students. I had already started making my cuts when I came across Ms. Timmerman's text. I went back and compared--there was no comparison. What she gives is a clean, clear, plot-thrust version of the play. It made it a lot easier for me to see what I wanted to do with my production. I pray she continues."
1,disapointment,i was very disapointed with the cd. it would have been nice if i could have previewed the music first.
2,The Essential George Gershwin,"I love George Gershwin tunes. But, after listening to the first cut on disk one entitled ""Prelude No.2 For Piano,"" my first thought was: ""You've got to be kidding, couldn't the engineers have reduced the ""hiss"" noise from this great collection."" Unfortunately, the problem was with my equipment. Once corrected, this CD was well worth the money spent. My vote goes from two stars to Five Stars!"
2,Academic Review,"The index does not represent the actual contents. Beginers can read this book for leisure, and improve your CAD software's philosophy. Experience users will not find much new materials here. The authors (20 some year design veterans)should have their drawings with proper dimensions and notations (ref. pp14-18). Too much text on materials that can be found from web site easily. This book should only be used as a referenced book, and not a teaching textbook. Next revision should only be concentrated on the Pro-Engineer software with additional graphical demonstrations."
2,Unkindest Cut of All,"This would have been an exquisite DVD if it hadn't been edited on rusty Cuisinart. The editing of this video is a crime; everyone involved in this project should be enraged.Balanchine instructed the editors of film versions of his ballets to ""edit on the breaths"" or words to that effect. Whoever did this edit cuts mechanically from one POV to the next completely without regard for the action on stage, the rhythm of the music or the dance, or any sense of his own timing. The result is nauseating.I'm not writing this to dissuade you from buying the dvd; it is a lovely performance of a great ballet. I am hoping that somehow word gets back to the hack who edited this thing that he or she should be ashamed."
5,Visionary!,"Calkins says, ""The problem is that if our teaching is to be an art, we need an organizing vision that brings together all of these separate components into something graceful and vital and significant. It is not the number of good ideas that turns our work into art, but the selection, balance, coherence and design of those ideas (p. 4)."" This articulates what I've sensed for some time and am finally beginning to understand after eight years of striving to help first graders become readers for life. Lucy Calkins built the foundation for elementary wiritng workshop and now has formed a vision for a reading workshop structure that, I believe, will endure. This book is for all elementary teachers who are about helping children create literatie lives. It is both inspiring and practical, heady and humble."
5,An Artful Presentation of the Reading Workshop,I have been a teacher for just a few years and I am currently working on my master's degree. I wanted to know more about the process approach to reading and writing so I approached my professor. She loaned me a brand new copy of this book. I found Calkins the most useful information in forming an understanding of Reading Workshop. Calkins even has a section that gives tips on how to acquire more books for your school. This book is invaluable!
1,Very disappointing,"So disappointed in this book. It was truly awful. Very little authentic horsey detail and full of insipid romance. Try ""The Dressage Chronicles"" by Karen McGoldrick for an exciting, believable horse story with a touch of romance."
3,Not in this case.,The product didn't work for my wife. The source is shellfish which has its own complications. Shellfish allergies appear to become apparent with this.
3,More information needed,"I haven't purchased this hair dryer yet, and will most likely improve my rating when I try it out. For now, it seems strange that what's crucial for a travel hair dryer - size - is not specified anywhere. Does anyone know what the length of it is in inches or centimetres? Does it have a swivel handle like its more recent version? Thank you in advance!"
5,Delightful simplicity,"This is a wonderful product of the 50's when things were less complicated and dreamers abounded. If you simply want to be entertained and spend the rest of your day/evening feeling good, this is your movie. Unfortunately, this was one of the last pictures produced before Hollywood became a prostitute to the riches of the baby boomers and began producing movies in which young people had no problems other than whether there was enough wax on their surf board or whether the waves would be high enough. Story of Three Loves has no deeper messages but has far more character. Yes, cliche as it is, it is a movie for lovers."
1,maximum disappointment,"If this DVD were FREE it would be a waste of money! Likes: nada. Dislikes: Boring, slow & poorly done. Dont waste your time or money. -the Hermit"
3,Better for older kids,"I bought this for my 18 month old after Christmas. It had good reviews so I thought she would like it. However, my daughter barely touched it. The only thing it really did was the drawbridge dropped when the flag was pushed. Not a whole lot to keep a little one's interest. I'm sure it would be a lot more fun for an older child using their imagination. I definitely won't recommend it though for the younger toddlers. The house and farm make a lot more sounds and hold their interest better."
1,Not very helpful for our kids,"This book was not helpful for us in terms of really engaging our kids, and we found the writing dry. There is a sexist streak too that won't win the hearts of mothers or daughters."
3,Thought provoking.,"I would love some feedback on her story ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"". Did those who walk away do so because they refused to live a comfortable and successful life at the cost of another's suffering? Did they go to find help for the boy?"
3,Disappointing,"I am a devoted fan of Misty's books, but I found many of the stories in her compilation to be poorly written. There were the occasional story that drew you in, but for the most part, Misty should have found some more creative authors this book. Ron Collins' story about a wizard's son and the hawks who always stayed around the castle was a good one with a surprising ending. Nancy Asire's story of a priestess resisting a conquoring wizard was also well written. Misty's own story was interesting, as always. Most of the others weren't worth mentioning. Sorry Misty, you did a better job picking stories for Sword of Ice."
3,"Ok, but the old version was better","I bought a set of Monster rechargeable batteries 4 years ago to use in my digital camera and my wireless microphone. They worked beautifully and would last a whole night out (5 hours or so) in my microphone, and most of the night in the camera. They had been charged and recharged two or three times a week for 2 years.I bought this set as replacements, and they didn't last all night in my microphone, I had to change them out mid-stream. They still work well, give me the juice I need. Maybe the older version that I got was just a fluke that they worked as well as they did."
2,"Useful, but not the highest quality.","My brother bought me this as a christmas gift, otherwise I probably would have stuck with my Swiss Army knife. While most of the tools are really useful, the metal that this thing is made of isn't very strong. My corkscrew bent screwing into its first bottle of wine (and it was a totally ordinary cork), and then when i tried to bend it back with a normal set of pliers it was very flexible and then snapped off at the base. Also, the tool feels flimsy when you use the pliers and really have to clamp down on something, and the handles also cut into my palm. All in all, it's useful enough to keep in the glovebox for an emergency, but I wouldn't use it when I had access to proper tools or even a real Swiss Army knife."
2,FRAGILE!,I had one of the original Leatherman tools which served me well but was prone to rust at the joints. My son gave me the Juice and initially I liked its size and loved the pliers. However after a couple of years of light use the springs holding all the tools fractured making the tool useless. I never abused the tool and it was very lightly used. I sent it back to Leatherman finally after it laid around broken for a year or so. They sent me a brand new one in a couple of weeks.Guess what? on about the fourth use of the knife blade the spring broke. I don't get it. I am sending it back. I think I will give it away if they send me a new one. Give me a Victornix Exployer anytime over this. I will just throw a Vise grip mini needle nose clamp in my back pocket and with the two will face anything without fear of failure.
2,not as described,"I am returning this. This is neither ""oversized"" nor ""warm."" It is a simple coverlet. It is definitely not worth the $86 price."
2,Not that good,"I bought a batch of these months ago and they look good. However, they just don't have the pinch to hold up a pair of slacks unless the material is coarse or the slacks have cuffs. Even then, if you are sorting through your closet to pick a pair, the slacks will fall out of the hanger unless you are very careful about your sorting. I wouldn't recommend these even though they look great."
2,Doesn't grab me.,"I thought Trio I was great and played it to death. Nothing here grabs me. I have owned the album for quite a while now and have never gotten into it. I don't like Western Wall either. Maybe I have lost the thread, but this does not sound as good as the earlier stuff to me."
5,"Excellent, what country music should be.","It is true that many of these songs have been previously released on various albums. This is because it was thought this album would never be released so the artists divided the songs amongst themselves, so we are lucky that this album came out at all. Also, while the music style is not quite contemporary or completely traditional it must be remembered that much of this album was recorded during the eighties which had a great influence on the sound. Despite this, or maybe because of this the album is truly remarkable and the harmonies continue to send shivers down my spine."
1,A complete loss of respect,"I have no idea why the singers and the producer decided to change the words in After the Gold Rush. It greatly subtracted from my overall listening experience of the entire album to hear ""felt like getting high"" change to ""felt like I could cry."" If the singers really thought that saying that phrase would condone drug use, then they're nave and they never should have chosen to cover that song. Who were they scared of offending? With that one change, the singers turned one of the great all-time songs into saccharin garbage and made me lose respect for them!"
1,"A ""Trio"" not worth revisiting","Amazon's review opens ""This long-awaited, highly anticipated follow-up to 1987's much-loved initial Trio offering doesn't disappoint"". It does, if you've heard the songs before. The album was supposedly recorded in 1994, and shelved because of it's lack of ""marketability"". However, Linda released most of these songs on her album ""Feels Like Home"" in 1995, with EmmyLou backing her on many of the same songs found here. It seems Dolly went into a studio, and dropped her tracks over the existing ones, and viola!, new album (to hear her solo rendition of Neil Young's ""After the Goldrush"", get a copy of 1996's ""Treasures""). I'm enchanted each time I hear the girls together, and realize how hard it is to get together to record, but a better effort was due their fans who've waited this long."
5,A long-awaited sequel doesn't disappoint,"The follow-up to their 1987 ""Trio"" album, 1999's ""Trio II"" by Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt doesn't disappoint. In fact, it builds on the earlier work and expands outwards to music beyond country. Beginning with the Carter family's ""Lover's Return,"" these ladies set the tone with a beautiful rendition of a classic. Sounding as though they're hanging out on the porch on rocking chairs, Harris, Parton and Ronstadt make their extraordinary collaboration sound easy. The harmonies are flawless. There's no grandstanding here--the point is not for any single voice to stand out, but for all three to melt together in an emulsion of vocal purity. They take on Neil Young's grand ""After the Gold Rush"" and transform it an eerily beautiful anthem of hope and fear. And Ronstadt on the quiet but propulsive ""Blue Train"" uses the long, lean line of her voice to vocally paint the picture of a train going, going, going. Gorgeous stuff."
5,"Really Good Follow Up To ""Trio""","The album is so great, I can't believe I never knew about this one earlier. The album is so moving, the music & the singers on here are totally haunting. The songs get to where they never leave your mind and it gets you where your listening to it over & over again, of course the most haunting and beautfully sad song on here is ""After The Goldrush"", I really can't understand what it's about, but all I know is that's the one song that sticks in my mind. ""Trio II (2)"" also gives you three different kinds of music, there's Country, Bluegrass, & a little bit of rock/pop especially on ""5. The Blue Train"", ""8. He Rode All The Way To Texas"" & ""9. Feel's Like Home"". Emmylou Harris & Linda Ronstadt are the lead singers on here & their great, But! Dolly Parton (one of my favorite's ever!) only sings for the leads on track 4 & 8, the rest is either back vocals are all together. Overall it's an A- album."
2,monotony,Each song was the same as the last...dull. The lively tones of each singer was not to be found anywhere in this cd. I thought I was going to hear a rousing selection of tunes. Instead all I got was monotonuous tones of boredom. I am so disappointed that I wasted the money on this cd.
3,deja vu,"Given that much of this material saw the light of day on Linda Ronstadt's Feels Like Home CD in 1995, this one has an anti-climactic feel to it, even though it was 12 years in coming. As on the last CD, the best moment belongs to Emmylou, with a beautiful arrangement of a Dolly Parton classic, ""Do I Ever Cross Your Mind."" Another effective moment: ""After the Gold Rush."" Unlike the other retreads from Ronstadt's Feel Like Home CD, this one features Dolly on lead vocals. Still, I think I'd prefer 3 solo CDs by these talented women, who don't record as often as they should, than one CD where their talents are dilluted."
2,some of it was funny,Most of this game was a bore. It was funny at times but really a complete waste of time to play. Do not pay more than 2 or 3 bucks for this game.
2,"Terrific, sick, funny... BUT VERY ""BUGGY""--- BEWARE!!","I'd love to love this game. I've been a computer nerd for nearly twenty-five years and ""politically incorrect"" pc games take the edge off the day when I get home from the nine-to-five. My present pc is no slouch vis. power/memory/graphics, but installing ""Postal2"" and keeping the game from crashing is a nightmare...I've followed the instructions on the official website, downloaded the patch, downloaded ""DirectX 9"", re-installed numerous times, ran the game in ""safe mode"", submitted bug reports...The result???A beautifully twisted vision of a potentially GREAT game which because of the ""bugs"" is ultimately aggravating and *NOT* worth the $$$.Unless you have tomorrow's top of the line gaming machine with *all* the bells and whistles, my advice is to wait until they can work the bugs out or it comes way down in price."
5,Easy to remove,This case is easy to remove from your shoes. And does not flop or distract from running. Great if you have different shoes you would like to use the nike plus with.
2,NOT WEATHERPROOF!,"Until this past week I would have given this pouch 5 stars. However, after running 2x this week with light rain, my sensor died. I have only had the Nike+ system 12 weeks -- which really stinks! I am now looking for a weather proof sensor pouch because with fall and winter around the corner... I am not risking it!"
5,Works Great,Works perfect! very happy with this product. Nike+ seems very accurate with this holding the sensor. Who says you have to buy Nike shoes?
5,"Hey, you do your job well. Nice going.","For those that don't wish to be tied down (pun intended) to running in Nike shoes, this Marware Nike iPod Sport sensor holder does exactly what's meant to do. Once you've got the holder in place on your sneaker, you never need worry about again. Lacing your shoes on and off is unaffected - it's the perfect product in that you forget you even have it."
5,Automate your finances and have peace of mind every day!!,"My husband and I read this book and went through David's early release of this program last fall. Each week we took a step from David's book and automated our finances. With this book we have automated our finances completely and have a greater piece of mind. We have automated our bills, our savings, our house payment and more. We feel so confident about our future. This is a great book that everyone should read and take action on. It really just takes a little effort for a huge reward!!"
4,Great Advice - Easy Reading,Daivd's latest book is so easy to read and follow. It's written so that all are able to quickly read and adopt his advice. Setting up accounts to automatically work for you - makes financial planning so much easier and soon you will see the fruits of your savings. Your accounts will quickly grow when you automatically add to them each month. Buy the book! You will love it. I did.
1,Useless unless you're clueless,"Wow! I was so enraged to see this book on the bestseller list that I had to jump on here. If you are the average lunkhead who has no clue what do with their money (which is obviously many of you), this book MAY be of some use. Even then, if you can't figure out that putting away 25-30% of your income into an IRA will result in a lot at retirement you should maybe start with some Dr. Seuss books. Anyone with sense will go away saying ""Tell me something I don't know."" I couldn't even bring myself to sell this one at a yard sale."
1,Terrible,After reading this book I can only conclude that the only person getting rich or will get rich is the author. Very sad.
3,JBQ Shills? C'MON NOW!,"I find it amusing that a certain reviewer is referring to all of the one star reviews as being placed by a ""JBQ Shill.""Seriously folks, how can a person who cannot sell books even afford to hire a paid shill? Doesn't make any sense.I do believe that that 1 star reviewer has a serious problem, probably deeply in debt and has a lot of hate so takes it out on reputable authors like Bach and perhaps is hoping that you suffer the same financial calamities.The Automatic Millionaire is an OUTSTANDING book and highly recommended for anyone who wants to achieve great wealth.In another regard, I do agree that JBQ's book really stinks and is totally worthless."
5,A realistic portrait of battle on submarine,"Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster give an impeccable performance of different leadership styles on the submarine. One was able and experienced with the dangerous waters of Bungo Straits, the other well-loved by the crew. Clark Gable had a hidden agenda and vendetta. The film was excellent in portraying his skills in pushing the submarine through drill after drill.To be able to dive fast in just more than 30 seconds, make bow shoots and detect the decoy of the Japanese fleet; All these make the film both suspensful and thought provoking. To run silent, run deep and pull off an ingenious strategy is a master stroke. For intelligent war play and two actors' great performances, this is a wonderful movie."
3,Overrated and dated,"The Bottom Line:Run Silent, Run Deep is often said to be one of the best submarine films ever made but even in such a narrow genre it's not at the pinnacle; poor special effects (obvious wires on the obvious models in the obvious tank) and poor pacing (the middle sags quite a bit at times) along with Clark Gable's one-note performance as the captain mar this modest but not great movie whose reputation far exceeds its qualities as a film.2.5/4"
4,I thought this was pretty good!,"It doesn't have all of her hits. But it does have just about all of the classics, I highly recommend it for experienced piano players, it's not 100% true to the recordings, but afterall it's only the piano part, and it's pretty close!! If you are a Carole King fan, and you play the piano, why wouldn't you want this book! :-)"
1,Carole King Tapestry,"As I am researching Carole King for a scholarly paper, I ordered this book hoping there would be an introduction or preface with some history or information on her. Alas, there were only the song lyrics and music for piano and guitar--nothing else. Presentation of each song offers a page with the lyrics in poetry form preceding the sheet music which includes lyrics and music. I gave it a 1-star rating only because it didn't suit my purpose. I am sure anyone wanting just the sheet music for ""Tapestry"" would be very happy with it. Hopefully, I will find time to tackle learning to play her wonderful music once the paper is finished."
1,Poorly/cheaply made.,Mine was out of warranty and the composite video started to become flaky. Turns out the plug to the video was loose. I then found out that many of the plugs were loose. So I took mine apart and found that many of the solder points were disconnected from the mainboard of the device. Completely faulty soldering.
2,A seperate out for every kind of output... :-(,"I bought this, only to find out that it does not do any conversion. So although it has svideo, rca, and those other rca ports, you have to run a seperate wire to the tv for each of them - one for svideo, one for rca, and one for that other rca kind. For me, I'm returning mine, as it completely defeats the point of having a switch to begin with.If it said this on the outside packaging I might not rate it so harshly, but it doesn't."
1,Big disappointment after GK2,"This game is beautifully rendered graphically but the content leaves much to be desired. The object of this type of video game or any other game is to be as entertaining as possible while presenting a stimulating challenge to the gamer. While this game is aimed at a mature audience the puzzle content is in many instances sophomoric, silly, and so obtuse as to be annoying. Kudos to the graphics department, a big boo to the puzzle and story people."
5,Bloody Good Game,"Gabriel Knight has been a highlight of the Sierra titles since the first game came out years ago. BotS, BotD continues that tradition in a fully rendered 3-D environment that lets the player become immersed in the scenes of the crimes that truly adds to the fun of being an investigator of the paranormal, like a mix between CSI and The X-Files. Though the puzzles can be weird at times (getting cat hair with scotch tape to make a fake moustache), and the locals French accents get annoying, you'll love the story, adore the characters, and start to hope that Gabriel Knight 4 comes out very soon."
4,At last after such a long wait,"At last, after such a long wait, Gabriel Knight III is here. It is fun, and I hope the series continues, but Gabriel Knight I is still the best, for atmosphere, characterization, and narrative. Unless your system is the newest available, it is likely that you will have problems running GKIII. I had to borrow a new laptop, because the game kept crashing on my Gateway 2000. The potential of interactive narrative is only being hinted at, though the GK series does a good job of suggesting what can be done in the future. There are still too many silly puzzles that actually detract from the story line. Also, the new age, mystical melange of ideas and themes seems excessive juvenile. Why not give us an interactive Agatha Christie style mystery to solve? Nevertheless, this game was fun, and I'm glad I did wait, however impatiently, for it."
1,Beware!,"While this might seem like a bargain, it ain't. I bought it specifically for ""Blood on the Sun"". It made the film look and sound as if it had been filmed underwater. My own fault. Too inexpensive to be true. Don't make the same mistake."
5,60 min is not enough time! But a GREAT 60 minutes,"Considering the series, I did not expect much & actually expected poor teaching. I was pleasantly & happily surprised.The teacher is three-time Canadian kung fu champion Sifu Glen Doyle who shows Kung Fu Hung Gar & is passionate & gets to the point fast. He's not boring at all, & has great, fast, beautiful form. He teaches the basics such as punching, stances, kicking & explains the forms & how the work using Olympic athlete Elvis Stojlo who also has great form. He also demonstrates some basic combinations of kicks, strikes using other students in normal, slow speed as well as different angles.I skimmed this with a martial arts friend of mine who was also surprised & impressed with the passion, style, detailed instruction. You really feel like you're in a dojo class w/o any digressing talking. Just explaining the moves, important info and move on.I plan to watch this all the way through & practice along."
4,"Dorris' final novel is flawed, but ultimately succeeds.","Finishing the final words of this novel broke my heart. Michael Dorris, at the end of this book, had 'pulled it off' and ended a sometimes-substandard book with beautiful prose and images. Rayona, the young girl from the haunting Yellow Raft on Blue Water, is here again and will be okay. I closed the book and looked at the author's picture for a long time, shedding a few tears for a great writer. It would seem that he, too, was deeply flawed, like us all, yet full of humanity and wisdom. I will miss his literary presence."
2,Disappointing.,"I read this book right after I had read A YELLOW RAFT IN BLUE WATER. Perhaps I should have waited the 10 years Dorris took to write the sequel. CLOUD CHAMBER is formulaic and bland. The reworking of Elgin's (a minor character in YELLOW RAFT) background to fit this book is dishonest and cheats the reader. My disappointment for this book colored my very positive feelings for YELLOW RAFT, but I was happy to hear Rayona's voice again"
5,I BELIEVE!!!!!!!,"RAHEEM DEVAUGHN'S ALBUM IS ONE THE BEST R&B ALBUMS I HAVE HEARD IN AWHILE. HIS LYRICS ARE CAPTIVATING, AND CONVINCING. HE SINGS FROM HIS SOUL!!! I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE THIS ALBUM YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! (I PINKY SWEAR)!!!! ALTHOUGH HE'S A LABEL MATE OF R.KELLY, I WOULD RATHER LEAVE KELLS TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET AND ENJOY RAHEEM'S LOVE EXPERIENCE!!!"
5,"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE Raheem Devaughn","Raheem's soothing voice is so relaxing. I already have his 2nd Album, and after hearing/seeing him in person, I was determined to purchase his 1st album. His melodic voice and the substance in his music will persuade anyone to appreciate love regardless of their ""love experiences""!! Any one who loves real music (R&B, NeoSoul, oldies flow, classics) will love this album. Put the CD in, Turn it up, Relax, and Groove to the beautiful sounds and words you are about to hear!!"
4,Can't Stop Listening To It...,"I went up to visit my grandmother and aunts up in Northern VA/MD/DC last week and they were playing Raheem Devaughn on the radio, the song ""Ask Yourself""...I had heard of him and seen the video for ""Guess Who Loves You More"" and was grooving to it and singing along to it. Then when I went up to MD my aunt and her husband were playing his album in the car and it was so hot. I find myself out shopping humming some of his songs and his songs stuck in my head all day long. Raheem is really talented and everyone should take a listen to this album..."
4,Congratulations to the author,"Amazing book, easy to read even for a non-English-speaking person like me. And thanks for the free pdf file available on-line."
4,Freaked out by the staggering lack of compassion between,"the pages of the volume. Yes, as the book rather harshly describes, God is boss of the universe & reserves the right to fire whomever he chooses. However, R.C. Sproul offers no help to those of us who have a heart toward others & know better than to look down our noses at fellow sinners. Yet the author portrays God as some sort of capricious monster, just itchin' to get his cookies off throwing unchosen souls into the pit. Mmmhhhaahaahaawwwww!!!"
4,"Well written, good logic","This was my first experience reading Sproul and I was very impressed my his style of writing. It is such that the question forming in your mind is often addressed by his following statements. I didn't agree with many of his ideas, but I could understand his logic."
3,Chosen by God,"A professorial dissertation on predestination and Reformed theology. Much human logic and illustrations but not much specific reference to Scripture. No challenge to the reader to search out the truth from the Scriptures, but a clear and somewhat contradictory presentation of the Reformed view."
5,Biblical Christianity!!,RC Sproul once again takes us into Scripture to wrestle with the tough yet refreshing truths found there...excellent and encouraging book.
4,Realistic and entertaining! For any age!,"I am not a teenager, but this book brought back many memories. Cat Bauer does a great job of personifying Harley in such a way that anyone, no matter what their age, can identify with. Harley is a remarkable character, and you feel you really get to know her, and her feelings in the story. She is very easy to relate to, as you go through her happiness and heartaches in the story. A great book to pass on to friends of all ages."
1,not like the photo - and silence from the seller,"Beware ... I bought this based on the description and photo. The item I received is WAY TOO SMALL for any Razr, especially the TALLER v3xx. Height aside, the case I got is WAY TOO NARROW for any Razr. Mine has white stitching, and no metal clip at the bottom (as in the photo). What I received should NOT BE ADVERTISED as ""for Razr"" ... oh, and the seller won't answer my polite email. But, then again, it cost $5 --- there's more than that under the seat of my car."
5,Simple and What's Needed,"If you want to hold your sharpening stone so it doesn't move on the counter, this is the product for you. It is well made and simply does the job!"
5,CHARMING AND EDUCATIONAL,"We found this DVD to be a very charming tutorial to learn the game of chess, we were glad we bought it. It is perfect for anyone who is interested in learning how to play chess. I would highly recommend this DVD."
4,Listen to the Liberals Squeal!,"This book offends Liberals according to an old formula; For every lie they have told about a Conservative Icon, it tells a truth about a Liberal Sacred Cow. Naturally they hate it.In point of fact the book is a well written account of the intellectual dishonesty that the Liberal Left has practiced for most of recent history. It is both more entertaining and more informative than the average Liberal tract, not that that is saying much.Try it. If nothing else, it will infuriate all the Liberals who see you reading it, which must be counted as a plus."
5,"The Art and Artist Are Not One, but Two","This is the first book I read by Paul Johson and found it incredibly interesting, most noteably because I enjoy reading about the lives of ""great"" people...often times, as this book highlights, the lives, friends, and especially family of intellectuals and other ""greats"" are negatively impacted by the very nature of what makes that person great in the minds of countless, anonymous others...you may like to read Hemingway or Marx, but after reading this book, you realize that to achieve greatness on a historic scale, one often is forced to both carry and administer lot of turmoil and pain in their personal lives. Something for any aspiring artist or writer, and highly recomended to those who are interested in some of these modern heroes."
1,Westwind,"The item arrived quickly, exactly as ordered. Unfortunately, the shoe runs large. The 6S fits like a 6 1/2 B. Since the shoe was inexpensive, on sale, it's not worth returning. This is apparently a manufacturer's sizing problem. Finding a true 6S has become almost impossible from any manufacturer, at any cost, from any supplier: store or online. This is an attractive shoe, seems well constructed, and would be comfortable, I'm sure, if it fit. If you have a very narrow foot, I would not recommend this item."
5,Great Workout!!,"I love this workout DVD, even bought it twice and downloaded on my IPad for when I travel. Easy to follow and is a great workout and I love that it is divided into three segments, so I can do one, two or all three, depending on the amount of time I have. I love Bethenny Frankel, I also bought her book from you, Skinny Dipping, and I am reading it now. Aloha from Hawaii, Cheryl"
2,She doesn't stop talking,"The workout itself was ok. I like how it showed different moves and how it didn't put too much pressure on you to be able to do so much at the beginning, but Bethenny just wouldn't stop talking. It got to the point where it was just annoying to listen to her. I wouldn't do the workout again."
2,Not Ted Chiang,While it was moderately entertaining his description of consciousness was ultimately so bothersome that it ruined the book.
2,stopped reading it,"Simply put, it is just not compelling. There are long stretches that read like a physics class, and where I blindly purchased this as a sequel to old mans war, it isn't at all.I was looking to see the characters in the first book develop a bit more, and instead we got new and less compelling ones. Skip it."
4,Ghost of the Old Man's War,"Compared to the first novel in the series, I found this a pale reflection, a specter without the substance. I really loved Old Man's War, and I didn't feel the same spark in the sequel.Personally I would have given three and half stars here, but I'm rounding up while waiting on book three.The semi-reflective tone of down-to-earth sarcasm the followed the first novel is missing here, and I really felt the lack. The narrators are more matter-of-fact and gritty, and less enthralling. It is hard for me to define what was specifically missing in the sequel, but I never felt in the middle of the story.A decent Sci-Fi read, but not among the best in the genre."
3,Good but not great,"I feel like this book could have been so much more. Scalzi has some interesting ideas, but he just doesn't push them far enough. Degenerates into peeew peeeew shoot 'em up. He's no Charles Stross."
4,Interesting,"After reading Old Mans War I was keen to read this. It doesn't contain the main character from that book, but has a few others from it who made appearances of various lengths.As the title suggests, it follows the special forces and ends up being about what it means to be human. Thankfully it is not bogged down in the heavy artsy style some books use when tackling the subject. More like, ""I do care about people and now I'll kill this creature in a violent manner to prove it"".It expands the knowledge of the books universe enough to pique interest and have you think about how the other races see humans as a species.While not perfect, a lack of visual description almost to the point of annoyance at times, it is a fun, smart read."
3,"incredible music, awful production.","I should have heeded the warnings of others about the production on this album. It's really a shame to ruin such great music with such lifeless, flat sound. Not everyone cares about these things, but it's hard to imagine someone who is a fan of EITS's better work will not find this to sound as flat as a pancake."
5,Great Frist Novel,"For those of us who have become fans of the work of writers like Cormac McCarthy, Pete Dexter and others with the guts to handle the seamier side of things up close, Reap is a breath of ""fresh"" air. Believably gritty and dark, Reap reminds me of McCarthy's early work: Suttree, Child of God, Outer Dark. While McCarthy struggled through obscurity for years until All The Pretty Horses won awards, someone smart discovered Rickstad in his fist crack at long form fiction and we readers are the beneficiaries. Expect more good work from this intelligent, observant and sensitive writer. Buy this book today."
4,very good debut,"This was a very good debut. It reminded me at timesofTwain, and at other times of Lewis Nordan. Sad and tragic, yet funny in a dry way. The cast of characters range from the depraved to the endearing.Some of the peripheral charcters were my favorite. The setting was beautiful. I could see and feel this novel. I would recommend it."
4,get this for the summer!,"The first thing I thought when I got done this novel was that I wished I'd not found it until summer! It would be a great book to read in the safe warm daylight. Dark and humorous and brooding and exciting! A character driven thriller/noir of sorts, with a splash of old time anti-hero in the way of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. The carnival scenes reek of summer adventure and danger. Get it for summer and read it in the sun so it doesn't keep you awake too much!"
1,too many mistakes,"this kindle book has an extremely large number of words that are cut off, but always in the beginning of the word.Example: ""brigade"" is printed as ""ade"", ""children"" is printed as ""ren"". there are so many typos that it is very difficult to understand the meaning of many of the sentences.I would like my money refunded"
4,Samsung DVD-VR325,I just got my unit. Works easily out of the box but when I made a DVD from a old home VHS tape it played easily with the Samsung but not in my DVD player for my other TV. Guess there is some format issue I am not aware of.
3,A little abstract for preschool children.....,"I do like the story, but I think it's bit abstract for a 3 year old. My daughter listens, but I question how much of it she really understands. Its a great story, but a little over the top for small a children."
3,no back support,I used this carrier for about 4 months and found that wearing it for more than 30 mins would cause a backache and i was only using it with a 15 lb child. There is no back support to help distribute the childs weight so it was all on the shoulders. Not bad for around the house but wouldn't want to use it for a longer period of time.
4,no complaints,"This really is worth buying and although i have the money to buy the expensive baby bjorns, i never did. i carried my son from when he was a month old and he feels warm secure and snug, as it's also called snugli. he likes it very much. at first i was able to pop him in without taking the sides slips out, but now he's a little bigger its not possible. the sides are a little difficult to open when carrying the baby, but easy when puttin him in. but buy it its really worth $20."
2,He cried because it hurt him,Every time I put Port in this carrier he cried. I couldn't figure it out. One day He HAD to be in it because I had a dr appt and we were waiting. I couldn't get him to stop crying unless I held him up higher then all of his weight in the carrier. It became quite clear. It was hurting his (for lack of a better word) boy parts. I left the carrier at the dr's office. Something that I also noticed was the material between his legs was far to wide and tight. Since then we have moved to a native sling and LOVE it. He's comfy and I'm comfy.The reason I gave it 2 stars is it is comfortable wearing it and I have a cracked tail bone.
3,"ok, but won't use again","We got this carrier for our first child. I was excited at the thought of being able to take walks without having to push a stroller, especially since my husband and I love to walk in the woods. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't even carry her at 2 months. The strain on my back was so intense that I had to give her to my husband. It's not really made for people who are tall (daddy is 6'1) He used it, but didn't really like it. We're looking at getting the Ultimate baby wrap which looks like it will give me better support and the reviews I've read are great. I don't mind a little extra time to get it one if I can comfortably carry my child."
2,Lots of promise but disappointing ending,"The start of the third book of this series was great, beginning a day or two after the ending of the second book. It moved slowly, well slowly as possible, through Wolf's and Jesse's whirlwind engagement but before even a quarter of the way through the book, I was picking up on many of the threads that hanged from this story. From people who were introduced to the plot before being abruptly killed off or barely mentioned again, such as Red Cloud and his tribe, to the fact that the last 20 pages of the book were incredibly rushed as though the author had given up on an actual plot and was just winging it. Greatly disappointing to what the other two books were and perhaps I would be more forgiving if there was another sequel on the way but since there has been 10 years between the publishing of the last book, I highly doubt it."
5,excellent,"This was an excellent book in the continuing sequence. I do hope the author writes another book, because she still leaves several issues hanging with no indication as to how they will work out."
1,measurement question,This looks like what I want but the measurements given have to be wrong. The three dimensions quoted would produce a nearly cubic cart. I can't order it not knowing its true size.T. Cortesi
4,A Revelation for the Previously Unaffected,"This was introduced to me when our family suddenly found ourselves involved with a victim of false accusations. It was most helpful in opening our eyes to what actually goes on -especially where ""the Law"" is concerned. Well written and informative."
3,Strap on your Agogo boots and go for a ride,"This is a wonderful collection of rare tracks from one of my favorite bands. The cover of U2'S ""Mysterious Ways"" far surpasses the original. And ""Zip"" is probably one of the most hilarious songs I have ever heard. I am not a guy, but I can only imagine what it would be like to get my <beep> caught in the zip of my pants. Although other than these two priceless tracks the rest of the album is not all that great. But if you are a KMFDM fan, and desire to have a complete collection be sure to pick this up."
5,My all time favorite,This is the perfect perfume. At least for me. the scent stays on for at least 24 hours and the combination of ingridents mada this perfum mt number one choice of all times. too bad it is not for sale in Europe.
1,surrender hell,"surrender hell. this movie is not cracked up to be what it is advertised on the packaging.the lenghth of the movie is only about 1.5 hours not as written on the disk cover.it suppose to be remastered I dont thinlk it is? I have a new widesceen t.v. and its just an awfull picture.I have thrown it in the bin.In the future I shall be going with the maine company titles,such as wb.mgm.lionsgate,etcKen barrett"
5,It works as advertized.,It works as advertized. It is easy to use and saves time when compared to other tools I have used.I can recommend it.
1,Completely useless,"I have a GPS which requires an angled cable. Unfortunately all the straight cable does not fit. I thought the adaptor would do the trick, but it does not go into the GPS. Completely useless."
4,Right Angle Mini USB Adapter,"I had looked for this adapter in several electronics shops with no luck. Found it on Amazon ""Shopers who bought this also bought..."" THe shipping was twice the cost of the adapter but well worth it. Solves several problems with my GPS Power Plug placement & interferearance with Dash & Controls"
4,I Like It,"Just shook my first Vesper in the Metrokane Bullet. It has enough capacity for ice & 6-8 oz of mix. Ergonomics are excellent - easy to hold on to and shake the hell out of it. You do, however, need to keep pressure on the strainer lid & small cap to keep them sealed - that is to be expected. I do have a question for others who have used this shaker - I don't find the ""bullet"" top useful when shaking. When using the bullet top to cover the top of the shaker (with strainer lid & small cap in place), the small cap comes off inside the bullet top while shaking. With the small cap loose inside the bullet top the shaker leaks. Seems the small cap should stay in place with the bullet top in place. Do I have a defective unit? I took one star off because IF the bullet top WERE designed to keep the small cap in place, the shaker would be even more ergonomic and PERFECT."
3,Hard to open,"Just got this the other day and only used it once so far. In the looks department it's great. Very elegant. In the mix your first drink department it works like a charm and is easier to use, less messy, and has better capacity than my old Boston-style shaker. But in the ergonomics department, it leaves something to be desired. After my first shaken cocktail, I wanted to pull the top off to rinse it out before the lime pulp dried on the strainer. I could not reoopen it. Tried everything, including a dish towel and silicon mat to get traction, but no, it wouldn't open. I ran hot water over it three successive times to ""shrink"" the metal to loosen the cover. Finally, on the third try, it came open. If I'm only mixing one drink at a time for myself and not expecting to have a second fine. But if I have a party going and want to mix for a crowd, this would definitely be a problem. I will try the hot water trick the next time I use it, but to have to do that is quite an annoyance."
4,"Excellent Alarm System, easy installation!","This alarm system is super easy to instal, the option that have: the dialer, is excellent and complement the system.it works perfect with all the sensors and the dialer.the built in siren is so Loud when it fires, when i saw the panel at firt time i never thank that this siren can make a lot of noise. i will buy the sisren for outside for maximun coverage.the set up is easy, and the dialer makes the call when the systen fires, excellent when you are out of home/work depends where you put it.By now i do not have any complain, i put it on my Photograph Studio, and i have problems with one flash trigger that does not work properly, from the day that i put the alarm, but i think is the trigger that is no well build.The Alarm system works at 318MHz. if you want to know about it.i do recomend this unit."
3,"A good product, but","I purchased this product 5 months ago. As of this date, I have not completely installed it. While the installation can be simple, there are too many components to deal with. The tape that comes with it does not hold on all surfaces. I live in an apartment and did not wish to nail or screw in the components. To do so would mean, that I would have to leave the system as a part of the apartment unit. I do not wish to leave the system as it was costly."
5,Another Great Geo Trax,My 4 1/2 year old LOVES his Geo Trax. He's had them since he was 3 and still plays with them daily. My mom bought this for him and he played with it for 2 solid hours today. It's great. He didn't even want to leave to go to Chuck E Cheese to play with friends when the time came to go because he wasn't done playing with it yet. That's a husge + in my book.
2,Not as good as it was supposed to be,This movie failed to live up to all the hype and its delivery was sloppy. I knew what was coming as soon as the plot was laid out. It was a far cry from the very humorous & iconic American Pies and Scary Movies I grew up with. This movie tried and failed.
5,movie lover,"Project X is great! We loved the movie and are going to purchase it to watch with all our friends. We've watched everything from The Hangover, to The Notebook, to Bag It. This movie is one of our favorites!"
1,Crap!,A sad modern day attempt to recreate the Animal House / Super Bad genre...and they failed. A complete waste of my time. Hated it! Not even mildly interesting.Not even funny watching it drunk. lol
5,"stupid kids' movie with lots of bared breasts, but a delight","just making the movie must have been a riot, and the result is a lot of fun, with a few life lessons thrown in. Rampant property and tree destruction, but no human injuries. In the genre of Porky's and Animal House. Good acting by young unknowns. Fun all around."
4,Good movie,"I can't remember if I paid $3.99 for it or it was free on Amazon prime, but either way it was worth a watch. Couple of good scenes, typical teen comedy."
3,Pretty funny!,Not what I was expecting....it was better! Definitely a movie I would watch again. I don't think it's the quality of Old School or Talledega Nights but it is up there for its era
3,Party,"Its just a party movie..Party,laughs,dancing,exploding,short people,fighting,pools...Just another Party movie..That is all..Really nine more words..Now six more words really...Not cool lol"
1,WTF?? - terrible movie,Thought this was gonna be funny based on previews . It was not. at all. period. Turn on MTV springbreak and you will see the movie for free.
1,"Honestly, terrible","This movie is trying very hard to be superbad. Unfortunately, the character Costa is the most annoying whiney bitch ever, and unlike Jonah Hill's character in Superbad, completely unlikeable. This is unwatchable."
4,Project X,"Bought this for my daughter, she loves the movie and I didn't have to leave home to buy it. The price was no different than buying from a store."
1,Life's All About Fun And Good Times,"While the rest of the world plunges into an ever-downward spiraling struggle, fraught with war, famine, murder, rape, alienation, and other ails, Hollywood decided to make this noxiously reprehensible movie embodying absolute idiocy, coupled with a delirious psychotic detachment from reality which happily boasts affectations involving destruction, perverse sex, and partying that brings general hurt to the people, both voluntarily and involuntarily, involved. All this in the name of ""fun and good times."" Just goes to show how many people are living in the same devolving bubble.Let's hope that this bubble of our immoral zeitgeist bursts before it's too late."
2,Project X,This movie was just okay. There were some laugh out loud moments but most of the movie was slow and unreal.
4,"A cheaply made, but functional hub!","I was looking for an inexpensive USB hub as I am quickly gaining new USB devices, and there are no USB ports left open! This was definitely the least expensive hub Amazon had to offer, and I decided to give it a try. It's exactly what you you expect for the price. It is very cheaply made, and you have to push a little harder than normal to insert devices into the ports.However, on what is MOST important, the device works well. I plugged the hub into my only remaining USB port, and then plugged other devices into the hub. They all work with no issue whatsoever! I am not overly picky with devices like this, as long as they work I am happy. For what I needed it to do, it is everything I need. I would buy it again.PROS = Inexpensive price, works exactly as it should.CONS = Cheaply made, you will need a little extra effort than normal to plug devices in."
2,Sold as a 2.0,"I bought this because it was sold as 2.0 hub, but my compoter says it isn't ! I have six USB 2.0 on my computer, so I know it's not the computer !"
3,Kinda Cheesy!,"This product works. That's enough given its low cost.However, it looks sort of cheesy, has an LED to advertise its presence and the cord is too short to get it out of the way.Just remember--It Works."
1,Blah blah blah,"Nothing new or enlightening here. While it may be helpful to some if you are hearing the ideas for the first time, I was looking for some new ideas."
1,The epitome of shallow and superficial,"This the first customer review I have ever written, but after viewing this film I felt compelled - no, obligated - to warn anyone else away from wasting their time and money in order be told that the only way to be happy in this world is through money, success, and love... The film stays true to this idea all the way through, and basically states that thinking in the correct way (or asking God) will garner you gifts along these three dimensions. The film is very weak and based upon personal experience of one man, with no real evidence either for or against the 'revealed' process, and the purpose seems to be to generate revenue from this poorly made documentary, with no real substance provided to the consumer."
4,Practical and positive,I've studied many techniques for self improvement and thought this approach was very practical and straightforward. I think this is one of the better approaches out there and it reinforces what was learned elsewhere. Stick with it and you will get results!
2,Uneven,Spray pattern very uneven. One side sprays in a uniform funnel pattern the other side is weak and spray to one side.
5,Excellent PDA,"This was the first PDA I ever had, and that was a while ago. I still keep it - I've gone through other Palm devices but not a single one had a better handwriting recognition (Giraffe) than this one. Of course it does not have the multimedia capabilities of more modern devices, but it works well with the PalmDesktop software, there were plenty of applications for it, and it excelled in what it was supposed to be - a rodolex with a notepad to scribble thoughts on with a calendar that beeps when your next appointment is due.It uses AAA batteries that last a lifetime - months!!!!"
5,This book is DYNAMITE !!!!!,Failed step 2 4 times then read this 3 times and passed !!!!Absolutely Fantastic Book !!!!!!Hope they have one for step 3 in the works.
1,Big disappointment....,"I thought this might be a fun purchase -- one to partner with a tongue-in-cheek book I purchased years ago, WHITE TRASH COOKING by Ernest Matthew Mickler, 1986 -- but it wasn't.... No comparison. This book is crude, and for the most part mean-spirited. Sorry I spent the money."
4,Review about Mennyms in the Wilderness,"This is the second book in the Mennyms series. The Mennyms are a family of life-sized rag dolls. This book really isn't about this family in the wilderness; they are moved out of their house by a real man named Albert Pond. They live in his house untill it is O.K. for them to move back into ther house. This book wasn't as good as The Mennyms, their first book, but never the less a great read. I hope you read this book. It is good for 4th to 6th graders."
4,A bit of a 'let down',"I bought this My Scene: Shopping Spree: Chelsea doll in early April. At first, i thought she was perfect, with her soft, red & streeked hair, and her awsome clothes and shoes. But, when i got her back to out hotel, i noticed she had a big grey blob on her fore-head. I tried to whipe it off,but it wouldn't come off, which really made me mad. Overall, a great doll, but the big, grey blob wrecked her from being perfect."
1,Would be nice if it worked!!!,I was looking for a comfortable headlamp with a red led for reading at night (Helps you go to sleep faster with the soft red light). First one of these I received wouldn't work right out of the box with a couple different sets of new batteries. Amazon was very good about replacing and I received the replacement in a week or so. The bad part was the 2nd didn't work either! Time for a refund and look for a different light.
1,Hate the Headrest!,"Everytime my 7 month old fell asleep, his head would flop forward and get stuck unger the headrest and he would scream. I exchanged it for the Britax Decathlon. I love Britax and realize this carseat may work great for some, but not for me. Maybe for a larger child with good head control would do better."
4,Great Product for the Price,I have an abalone necklace for which I needed a pair of matching earrings. These definitely fit the bill! They appear to be of good quality.
2,Very poor durability,"We have had two of these units within 9 years. The first one lasted 4 years and then died, and we figured it was a random occurence and got another one. The newest one is 5 years old, and has just croaked. Five years is a ridiculously short period of time for an appliance to last in normal household use. The cost of repair is more than buying a new one. Do not buy this product!"
5,Dumb Luck,"So here I am, it's nearly two in the morning, I leave a Jazz club on Bleecker Street because the cat on xylophone (vibes, man) is giving me a funny look. I grab a Sunday Times, carry it into Café Dante, and work on the crossword over a double espresso. They've got Joe Franklin on the radio, Memory Lane, and Joe is talking with this guy J. L. Abramo who writes Private Eye novels. I write it down in the margin of the magazine section. Following afternoon, I walk to the nearest bookstore, I won't name names, and find ""Clutching at Straws"", a signed copy if you can believe it. It's raining in New York City, which is all it ever does lately, and I read the thing in one sitting. You want a review, go to Publishers Weekly. You want advice, read this book."
2,Misrepresented,"Read the only review on the 1 1/2"" brush and was hoping the 2"" one would be the better quality. Not so! It is not the blue one as shown in the picture. I will probably keep them as the handle is the same and is better for my arthritis, but the bristles are not the same as the original Newell-Rubbermaid blue handle one shown in the picture. Another product ruined by a cheaper bid from a Chinese company and then discontinued when the product no longer lived up to it's reputation. I'd pay for a good brush made in the USA but can't find one. Recommend you skip this one. Not worth the price!"
1,"Wow, so much useless information...","I can't believe how much fluff this book has. Talk about everything and the kitchen sink. There is a thing about going overboard, and this book does it. Not only is this book poorly organized, I would say 75% of it has nothing to do with the Security Design exam."
5,A must...,"I haven't read this yet. I'm still going through the XP book, but if this one is even close, this book is a must. An easy read and well laid out. The accompanying CDs are very beneficial also."
3,"moisturizing feel, but not strong enough","Goes on well, feels good, but I had to add a little isopropyl alcohol to the bottle to make it more effective in relieving razor burn. When it says ""for sensitive skin"" I thought it meant sensitive to razor burn. Instead it means sensitive to strong ingredients that relieve razor burn."
4,Good stuff - never liked after shave before,"I never liked aftershave before. My father used to use Old Spice, and when I started shaving, I tried a few different varieties. None of them really appealed to me.This stuff I like. And I'm not the sort of guy who likes a lot of junk on my skin.But I agree with the other reviewer, four bottles will probably last me a few years. I'd recommend giving a couple away."
3,Already ripping,I registered for this item and when I received it for my shower I was happy. My son is 7 weeks old and already the strap is ripping at the seam. Its time for a new bag already. Not worth it.
3,"Yeeehaw! If you have a red neck, you'll love Honky!","This albulm is one kick you in the ass, rock 'n' roll, red neck tribute. The songs are a bit long but it's the lyrics that are so amusing. Ironically, they seem to poke fun at the average Texan/good ol'boy. These guys seem to have conjured up this band idea back in high school and are just now getting around to putting it together. Jeff Pinkus, formerly of Butthole Surfers, dons his curled up cowboy hat while Carson Vester, guitarist, sports his tattoed neck and Lance Farley, drummer, formerly of Austin's very own Thighmaster wags his tongue similar to Michael Jordon while playing. It must be an accuracy thing. This trio combination makes for an interesting mix of followers. Forget ZZ Top, Honky is now the national band of Texas! Mandingdong!"
5,Excellent resource for purveyors of open source solutions,"I came at this book from a different angle - that of someone looking for resources and strategies to convince potential customers of the benefits of open source solutions. Golden's book is extremely valuable in this regard. It presents a framework (the OSMM) to assess the viability of an open source solution. It has the added benefit of managing customer expectations for me. It informs the intended audience (IT organizations) what they can reasonably expect from enterprise level open source solutions and what their responsibilities entail. In short, the author describes the underpinnings of a paradigm shift in the process of evaluating and deploying software."
1,DUD BOOK,I don't even know why I ordered this. Perhaps because of some good reviews. But I just don't get it. Not funny. Not useful. Just a waste of money. Let me save you some money by giving you a way to annoy people: Pick you nose in public. All the book is not this tastless but just as useless.
5,comprehensive & great photos,"I read this together with ""London's Secret Tubes"". The photos in this book are well taken and portray an old and complex transport system. If you enjoyed the Underground scenes in Skyfall, these books will feed you imagination."
1,Great Player - Lousy Teacher,Don't expect clear explanations from Emmanuel. This was not worth the hefty price tag. At about $5 I would have felt I got my money's worth.
4,"Barbie's much younger ""younger sister"" Kelly","It's true that Barbie and Ken were never married, but those correcting others here about Barbie's relationship with Kelly need to open their eyes. Are we so gullible that we're going to believe Barbie that Kelly is her sister? Barbie dates to an era where it was not uncommon for an unwed pregnant girl to be shipped of to ""stay with her aunt"" for a year, then after her return she would conveniently gain a ""baby sister"". Marlon Brando went most of his life call his grandmother ""mom"" and his mother ""sis""; google it for the details. The images and text accompanying the set of Barbie pushing Kelly in a stroller makes it clear what their true relationship is."
3,A solution,"Don't worry ladies. I'll deal with this Blaine guy for you. He will be entering the witness protection program under the name of Julian. He will be shacking up with Princess Anneliese at my house since the ""real"" Julian can't be found. Once he's gone, Barbie can get over her little mid-life crises and get back with Ken. Then all will be right in the world again."
3,WHY!!!,"WHY!!!Barbie and Ken had a thing for each other!Why does she like Brain or whatever you call him better than Ken,I mean she's known Ken since Barbie dolls came out!How long has she known Blaine,two or three months!?!But he still is cute and is a nice doll.Hes not educational at all because it does not rub of good on little kids."
5,The Stick,Purchased the stick for my sons - both soccer players and one a cross country runner / track runner. Both very pleased with The Stick and works out muscle pain and soreness. Very pleased with price I found on Amazon as well.
4,Preferred the smaller size.,This works very well. I have a larger version but it was harder to use. Both actually help more than I thought they would.
2,not stiff stick,"this product needs to be much stiffer to be able to do the job that it is suppose to, should only be considered for travel use that is about all it could be good for"
3,Confiscated at TSA,"My husband and I really love our sticks. They work well for sore muscles and once you get good at it you can massage the back, neck, everything.HOWEVER, my husband's stick was confiscated at TSA last time around. He's on a plane 2 x a week. The stick made it probably 30 trips with no problems, then... bam, they take it. So don't be surprised."
5,Great Product,"I reached the point where stretching just wasn't enough. I use the 17.5"" Stick before and after exercise to loosen tight leg and hip muscles. After using ""The Stick"" for just a short period of time I noticed I had better mobility. Wow! What a surprise to discover that my lack of mobility was due in large part to tight, stiff muscles. Now that my leg & hip muscles are looser, walking is easier. As an added bonus it has helped relieve some of my lower back issues too. Using it regularly offers real pain relief. The Stick is light weight and easy to use on yourself. Purchased on the recommendation of my chiropracter, this incredible, inexpensive tool is money well spent!"
2,superfluous cd,It is useless to buy this new released cd! what a superfulous idea to release again the most commercial songs from the commercial famous rock band. Buy the original albums! like you have bought the other cd's from other rock bands... Thanks
3,hmm,"No, I don't own the album, but I do have every other Zep album so I know all these songs. 2 changes I'd make to this compilation. I'd have a whole lot more tracks from Zep 2 (Heartbreaker, Ramble On) and I would put Going to California instead of Battle of Evermore. I don't suggest this to anyone, I suggest getting all Zep albums, but if you're new to Zep and would like to get a starters compilation than this is for you!"
5,The Thunder of the Gods,"How could anyone give this less than 5 stars just because it doesn't give you all of Led Zep's music? The music that's here on these hour-long volumes of classic rock is absolutely masterful. These discs are perfect for an old Led Zep fan like me who still has all the old records... and a means to play songs missing from this anthology. I certainly wouldn't buy this if I had already sprung for a larger Led Zep CD collection, but for someone like me who finds 1 and 4 their best albums (both well represented here) and 2 and 3 over-rated but for a few killer tracks (""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Imigrant Song"" are included) EARLY DAYS is ideal... LATTER DAYS doesn't make as good choices from the available material... 'Physical Graffiti' is well represented, but don't through out your copy of 'Houses of the Holy'..."
2,Why?,"I really enjoy Led Zep's music, but enough is enough. The only way to release a greatest hits collection by these guys was to release it over six discs on the two box sets (Just like they already did.). This collection leaves off too many worthy tracks."
1,The CD is tuned at F!!! A HUGE FLAW!!!,"I bought this CD/book package for me to practice while playing the CD along with it. However, the CD is tuned at ""F"" which is unheard of. I am a Floyd Rose player and there is no way for me to adjust my guitars' set up just for this purpose. What a terrible waste of money! I am wondering if the author is aware of this serious problem. Dave Celentano is a great guitarist but it's a shame that he doesn't care about his quality of work. Maybe he just cares about money? Also, the publisher has to take a responsible action by dispatching corrected CD to buyers."
1,"Pretty, but not practical or durable!","I bought this bag and promptly sold it on ebay. It is pretty, but not made very well. The inside zipper did break the 1st time I used it. It does not have any type of organization inside, just one pocket that hangs from the inside wall. Everything just gets lost and it is SOOO HARD to find anything in it. I bought the Wendy Bellisimo ""Love"" bag and am very happy!! Lots of room and easy to find what you want, when you want it!! Face it, time to search when the little one is screaming for something, not going to happen!!"
3,Gorgeous But Cheap Quality,"When I saw this bag I had to have it!! It was beautiful and stylish, so I got it. I got so many compliments. No one believed it was a diaper bag. It has great matching accessories. Soon after buying it the interior zipper broke. Then a while later the main exterior zipper broke. Would I recommend this bag? No. It's style does not matter if it's falling apart."
3,Believe the reviews...,"We bought this for our grandchildren. Within 5 minutes of our setting it up, the bucket on the end of the digger arm cracked. We called Little Tikes and they are sending a new one. But shouldn't it last longer than 5 minutes??VERY disappointing for our grandchildren and for us who spent so much money on the thing."
1,Wish I'd have read previous reviews,"Well, everything that I'm NOW reading is true. The sand that I just removed from the sandbox was green and full of leaves and bugs. The digger is nearly impossible to use. Honestly, this was just a breeding ground for mosquitos..with all of the standing water...in the sand...in the dumptruck ..and in the digger.I'm sorry I wasted the money."
2,What a disappointment!!,"For 2 years I was against getting a sandbox. But then I saw this one and agreed to let my son have it for his 4th birthday. I just knew what a hit it would be since my two boys (4 & 2) just love playing construction site in the dirt. I should have stuck with my first instinct. The lid doesn't fit well, so needless to say there is often rain water in it- which is a breeding ground for mold, algae, and mosquitos. The digger is also awkward to use. I spend more time removing the water and wet sand than the amount of time my kids actually get to play with it. This toy has real potential but with the poor design it is a waste of money."
3,Don't waste your money,I am very disappointed with Little Tikes. I had been a long standing customer and would purchase LT Brand over others. This is the 2nd time that I have been disappointed after purchasing a LT Brand toy and will not waste my money again. We are very disappointed with what could have been a great toy if they would have made a lid that fit and the scooper arm to work a little easier. Don't waste your money on this toy.
5,The kids can't get enough!,"...My children love this item! I am the family babysitter and if you have a kid in my family there is some part of my day that I will probley have someone else child. It is a fight to get them to play with the other toys in the yard. It is big and fits 2 or more children. Yeah the water doesn't drain out anywhere but moist sand makes better sand castles. We have never had a problem with things growing in it. The only semi-complaint I have with this item is the lid feels not so strong. The kids keep stepping on it, nothing has happened so far but If just looks like it will break. I guess that is a good thing. They love the scoop and bucket. We can't enough of this item. We might buy a second!"
3,I can't help it I like it,"I got this for my son last summer. I have to constantly let the sand dry out. I have been in contact with the company and they informed me no where does it state the top is to keep water out (stupid me that's what I thought lids on sandboxes were for. But every day, some days all day, we are playing on it. He has several trucks that fit well on the ramps. I think all the little tikes trucks are made to fit it. If I had known of water problem before I bought it I may have not bought it. But I do think he plays in it so long is because its........cool"
2,no so great,"Constantly full of rain water, no drain plug. Claw broke very soon after we got it. Emailed Little Tikes since their site has replacement parts but not for this. No response. called, no replacements for it."
4,Nice large sandbox,"Unfortunately my daughter is too young to take full advantage of the crane arm. But the sandbox was quite a hit when it first arrived. the cover make keeping local cats out, easy. not to mention insects that like to burrow in the sand. would recommend to anyone interested in this sandbox."
2,A waste...,"I was very excited to see this sandbox, and went to great lengths to find one for my 2 boys last summer. I was very disappointed that not only does the lid not keep the rain and grass clippings out (which results in filthy, ruined sand in no time at all) several of the parts on the scoop broke over the winter. This was not from overuse, as the kids hardly touch it - which is fine with me given the condition of the sand. I e-mailed Little Tikes and was quickly replied to with a promise of replacement parts - much time has passed and the parts aren't here."
5,No Problems here!!!!,"I bought the sandbox for my son's 3rd birthday, that was two years ago. It is still in great condition, it has been through some bad weather, even some hurricane force weather. Still, in great condition. No problems with rain getting in the sand and the scoop works still. And i havent notice rust the metal parts. This sandbox is wonderful and Little Tikes has great products."
2,Not what you expect from Little Tikes,I agree witht the majority of the other reviews. The poor fitting lid allows not only water but large numbers of bugs and leaves to accumulate in the sand box.The lid is suppose to also function as a road when place beside the sandbox but if my children (ages 1 and 5) put any pressure on it while driving the trucks up the lid buckles. As a result the lid is developing cracks from the buckling. The shovel (which seemed like the most appealing part of the sand box) is impossible for my 5 year old to operate. I attempted to use the shovel this summer and it broke into two sharp and jagged plastic pieces. This was a HUGE waste of money and disappointment.
3,Too hard to pierce,My daughter is 5 and was ecstatic to get this doll. There was NO WAY she could pierce this doll's ears herself- it took me 25 minutes to do it. My daughter lost interest in the process. Cali girl is cool but the ear piercing is not!
1,FAILED,"Bought two of these cables, neither one worked. Then bought $1.00 extension cables at DOLLAR TREEE and those worked perfectly - go figure. Don't waste your money on these."
1,Cheap cable but poor service and not willing to take a return.,I thought I was getting a good deal by buying this cable from Sabrent. When I took it out the box my video capture wasn't working and suspected the cable. I verified the cable by buying another from Fry's. When I asked to return the cable to manufacturer all they could suggest was that I try another computer. That was the last cable that I'm buying from them. Very poor customer service and not willing to return the cable.
4,Almost Right,"I bought three of these so that I could use my webcam for observing betta fry. It's been working great! The only problem was the chords fit together loosely and kept falling apart, so of course I had to duct tape them. There's duct tape on a lot of stuff I own."
5,Fun to Read.,"The Jazz and the Blues is an easy to read and fun book. It moves quickly without a lot of unnecessary description. Mr. Woods gets down to the story and moves it right along to keep your interest piqued.I'm sure that many less courageous souls have longed to do just what Arthur Combs did--just get in your car and drive and not look back. The story is a down-to-earth, often times humerous account of Arthur's adventures on this journey. It is to the point and not cluttered up with a lot of description to make the book longer.I thoroughly enjoyed it and think you will also."
2,Buyer beware,"There's nothing wrong with the performance: it's Gershwin himself, according to the editorial review, taken from a piano roll. ""Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" it says on the packaging. All I can say is, it's a thin excuse for a surround-sound DVD-Audio disc: the one track is the only thing on it. Maybe 15 minutes, total, though nowhere on the disc or its packaging does it mention the track list or the timing. Or that it's remastered from a piano roll, for that matter. And all at a premium price? You've got to be kidding!Watch out for the entire DVD-Audio series by Alexander Goldberg Jero. I bought several, to fill out my DVD-Audio collection, and none have lived up to expectations."
2,This is *not* a quant/behavioral finance book....,"This book starts off on the premise that 1) companies can manipulate eps but not cashflow and 2) rather than engage in all sorts of scenario analysis, look at the securities price and determine what growth rate this implies for sales etc.Great start, but they then begin a long discussion that basically involves stock selection. Now, i though they spent the first 50 pages of the book saying that stock selection and analyst engaged in this activity are swimming upstream...Very dissappointing. Another ""How to Pick 'em"" book."
2,A good practical book,"A good practical book which try to address real world image and video compression designs, but it is inaccurate, typos, ...."
3,Not as advertised,"Be warned: Yes, you will receive 300 bingo chips, but they will not be as displayed in the image. I received three separate plastic bags of 100 bingo chips each in three colors. This aside, they are fine bingo chips. As a falsely advertised item however, it only merits three stars."
2,Needs more pictorial diagrams,The book was just 'OK'. It would be easier to copy designs if it had more actual pictures of the processes. I would not recommend it to friends.
3,lacks the last ounce of elan and incandescence,"I thought it was pretty good when I first heard this disc.After having seen the film, however, it sounds decidedly tameand lacks elan. That said, based on the ""original score"",it is in no way a bad recording of this perennial masterpieceand deserves a place in your shelf. For anyone who thinksthat Bernstein's operatic rendition is a bit overblown, thismay be the one to go for. The sonics are good without beingexceptional."
1,BAD,"This book had a fun sweet beginning. Delaney and Jack had great chemistry. I thought this was going to be a great fun screwball romance, but it fell flat. Delaney turned out to be a sniveling, self absorbed, liar. The author never adequately conveyed a strong enough reason to continue to lie to the entire town. The ending was anticlimatic and I wished Jack hooked up with Kim took custody of Emily and left."
2,"relevant issues, but not much of a story","While the issues Bayly deals with (euthanasia/assisted suicide, abortion) are extremely relevent in today's society, as a novel Winterflight wasn't exactly great literature. The dialog was wooden and a lot of questions were left unresolved at the end of the book. I also question his resolution of the characters' problem - from a Christian perspective, I don't know that the solution George chooses for himself and his grandson is any better than the alternatives they faced."
5,Great toy!,I purchased this for my nephew's birthday. He loves it!!! It's adorable and is very sturdy. Affordable priced racing ramps for a young child.
5,Hours of Fun,"I almost didn't buy this for my son because at first look it seemed that it had no educational value, and didn't really do anything. I was sooooo wrong! After my son received a toy with a roller coaster and I saw how much he enjoyed just pushing the car down the roller coaster, I ran back to the store and picked it up. It wasn't very expensive so I thought it would be worth a shot. From the time I brought it home he has loved it. At first it was just the fun of watching the two cars it comes with go down--and he got a kick out of the ""racing"" noise it makes, but then he started to use it with all his toy cars and he picks out the different color cars and races them and counts them as they go. His biggest thrill is letting them all pile up at the bottom into a big heap, then separating them and starting all over. For him its pure enjoyment, for me it was a valuable lesson--sometimes you just have to give kids stuff just for the fun of it!"
2,Take the batteries out!,"If you want to save your sanity, take the batteries out of the thing before you give it to your child. It does not inhibit the function of the toy, but it will save your sanity!"
3,Too much noise,"Well if you rae the type of parent that enjoy to much noise, you better choose this toy, you will really enjoy it more than your kids.Or if you have to buy it because of you kid, you might add on your shopping list a 500 tablets of aspirin ( a Month supply)"
1,ANNOYING - NO OFF BUTTON,"First off lets start that this toy does not have an off button or a mute button. This toy has a feature that simulates the revving of a racecar engine. It's supposed to rev when you release the cars or when you pull the release in the opposite direction. However, the mechanism is sooo sensative. It is constantly going off. Even just walking by it it goes off."
3,Very durable but annoying,"My son, age 3, just had to have this toy. He plays with it every now and then but not often. It also doesn't have an off button. It will start making annoying sounds when we're just walking through the room. I'm ready to put it in the garage sale!"
1,World's Most Annoying Toy,"I bought this for my son last Christmas. He enjoys it but the toy is about to meet Mr. Garbage. This toy has a feature that simulates the revving of a racecar engine. It's supposed to rev when you release the cars or when you pull the release in the opposite direction. However, at any given time (day or night) the revving of racecars can be heard. The least little bump to the toy, slightest breeze in the air or walking across the floor can set the thing off. I have to store this toy in our den downstairs or it will wake up the entire house at night. If Fisher Price hadn't designed it in such a sensitive manner, it would be a great toy; but it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING. Don't waste your money."
3,About 2 days worth of fun.,"My only real complaint is the really annoying ""racing"" noises that this thing makes when you launch the cars. It was so annoying that despite the objection of my son, we took the batteries out. Also, you get what you see. A very basic spiral track. Like I said in the title, it gets old and boring pretty quickly. Thankfully, it wasn't expensive."
1,Watch popped out of the band,"I purchased this watch at Wal-Mart, and after a month or two the strap separated from the watch on the side of the buckle. It pulled away from the watch where the two upper buttons are located. The watch could be hooked back into the strap; but the strap remained loose and the upper part of the watch separated from it frequently. This continued for another month or so until today, when the watch popped completely out of the strap and was lost somewhere. This is a terrible design and I would never purchase another one."
4,sports watch,I am well pleased with this sports watch - which I mainly use on weekends - especially to time my bike rides.The only (slight) problem with it is that the words on the buttons are very tiny but I'm not sure how this could be solved with the space limitations.
3,Watch had condensation gathering in it in 30 days,"This is my 4th Timex Ironman watch in 15 years. The strap has always worn out before the timepiece. Not this time. I had the watch for a month and had worn it in the pool with seemingly no issue. I flew to Hawaii a few weeks ago and upon landing noticed condensation in the lens. It still has not dried up. I am out of the Amazon.com return period so have contacted Timex directly. We'll see how they handle it.Other than that, I like watch...great color!"
1,faulty watchbands on the women's ironman triathlon sleek,"My wife has been through three of these watches. She loves the functions of the watch for work, but the bands keep breaking. So far, googling hasn't shown a source for replacing the watch bands.It shouldn't be too difficult. The watch body itself just pops right out of the rubbery band. Given the tremendous amount of bands that are breaking, I'm surprised that someone over in China hasn't started making a living from selling replacement bands. But even eBay doesn't have anything.I'm wondering if we can find a craftsman to fabricate an alternative?"
5,great timex and inexpensive,"i researched this watch and others prior to buying. if you go to the actual timex website - you can find this watch for around $60. at k-mart i found it for $47. amazon has this one for $28. it's great for everyday use, but especially if you work out a lot. i use it when i'm swimming laps, going running, etc. it can store up to 50 laps and you can review them. 3 alarms. can't go wrong there!"
4,"Looks and Works Great, Doesn't Last Long","This is the third one of these watches I have owned in the past year and a half. It looks great, works great, but my previous 2 have both had the watch band come detached from the timekeeping piece. I wish they would hold together longer. The watch still worked perfectly when the band failed. Mine underwent harsh conditions in Central America and were often wet and always in hot humid conditions. Maybe that contributed to the failure."
1,NOT water resistant,"I bought this watch for my daughter to wear to sailing class. 1st watch was dead within hours, returned it and 2nd watch was dead after it's first swim. Total junk."
1,Water-logged,About a week after I got the watch I wore it to the indoor pool and it had condendsation almost immediately. Then the functions didn't work. Definitely not water resistant. I also thought the band was stiff and uncomfortable.
1,I want my money back!,"Simplistic and poorly constructed. This book is offensive to other religions and those who question the narrow confines of a twisted version of Christianity that is worryingly popular at this time. I was actually shocked at the weakness of the arguments and very surprised that the author did not see their obvious faults. I was expecting a book that would offer a refreshing take on Christianity, with factual and honest information. I think this would turn many away from Christianity. It is sad how the basic truths of this religion have been distorted."
4,"Clever Premise, Compelling Story","I've meant to read this little book for some time. The thought is intriguing, a dinner with Jesus. Hmmm. David Gregory unfurls a story set in an Italian restaurant that ends up being mostly dialogue. But fascinating dialogue. Nick is skeptical, sarcastic, angry and not looking for anything even resembling church. He expects that this invitation is a practical joke and spends a portion of the dinner date scanning for his work buddies. But as Nick and ""Jesus"" talk, Nick begins to think.This is a very quick and entertaining read. One that might just make you ponder some of the truths shared within. Nick is a scientist so much of what is shared is geared toward a scientific or logical mind."
2,Interesting concept marred by flawed execution,"The concept was interesting. As a non-Catholic Christian, I found it appalling that the Pope referred to non-Catholics as ""deficient"". I am similarly appalled by this writer's casual dismissal of other religions. Treatment of this and other topics was superficial and narrow-minded."
5,Food for thought,"I thought this was a wonderful ""little"" book with a ""big"" messege. Made me wonder what questions I would have for Jesus/God. I think everyone should read it..might make the world a better place."
3,"Short, but sweet","An interesting tale of a modern day's man out to dinner with Jesus.The way that Gregory weaves together apologetical answers to get to the heart of the issue of faith is very clever and easy to read and follow. An enjoyable read that may not exactly present new things, but will refresh the soul, and maybe just maybe at the end of the story your heart will fill with gladness as mine did; though the story is fictional."
1,Worst. Trimmer. Line. Ever.,"These are WAY too brittle. While edging my lawn, I had to change them literally every 20 seconds of use. I could only edge maybe 2-3 feet at a time before they had completely broken off at the base. Seriously, just trimming grass, no rocks or cement with an electric trimmer. I went through 2 packages just to finish the front yard, forget about the back. For what these cost, I might as well just buy a new weed eater every time I mow the lawn."
2,Not for the TeleSelling Professional,"While I found this book helpful in the general sense of the word, it was aimed solely at the ""outside"" sales rep who sees his/her customer face-to-face. It provided good reminders for seasoned sales reps, but wasn't revolutionary in it's ideas of selling. It was a short read - no more than 4-5 hours. It demonstrated very good closing tactics and objection handling, but all of this is after you make contact. It didn't explain how to get past the secretary screen, how to get the appointment or even how to find out who the decision maker is. Most of the sale, if not all of it, is done over the phone and that was completely overlooked."
3,Buyer Beware! Pictures Subpar,"This book is a reprint and I knew that going it, but I'm really disappointed in the quality of the pictures. I have seen an original copy and it would be worthwhile to try to locate one of them. There is a wealth of information, but if you enjoy the old family pictures as I do, you won't be happy with the price of the book once you've seen how poorly the pictures were reproduced. My advice would be to pay the extra money and find an original copy."
4,Fun quick read,"Definitely an entertaining fast read, quickly immersing you in both the characters and the arm wrestling subculture. It made me want to read more on the subject,and more by the author."
1,very poor product,"Within a month of occasional use, the nonstick xylan coating of the skillet began to lift and come off. The metal underneath the xylan rusted and the poacher/skillet was unusable.I guess you get what you pay for, at $16.99 it seemed like a good deal. I have since ordered a calphalon egg poacher which is much sturdier and better made."
2,Love at first...,I loved this pan when I first got it. It worked great for poaching eggs (and scallops) evenly. After about two years the paint started to peel off inside the cups and the lid started to rust. So I bought another one thinking I would be more careful to use only rubber spatulas to get the eggs out. Still had problems with the paint starting to peel. I will be trying a different model next time.
4,nice product,worked very well will recomend to friends worked as advertised nice price good quality loved it it it it it
1,Not much is helpful in this short book,"I was expecting more details in the pitching section to provide more drills and advice, but the book is too general in my opinion for helping a golfer with their short game"
3,Not the best sound,"Selected songs were OK. Only some concert versions could be also included.However, CD seems to be recorded not well as the sound is not satisfactory. Especially the vocal is so much distorted from the drum & guitar. Anyhow, it was good to listen best selections in 1 cd."
2,Not bad but a step down,"First off, I LOVED ""Big Surprise"". One of the most original album in Christian music in a long time. I was eagerly awaiting more. Well i got more today and i was sorely disappointed. It's not a bad album, but a huge step down. They want to get on the radio and they want to be popular. It's obvious. They now sound like every other straightforward, modern rock Christian band out there. If you like Gin Blossoms, Third Eye Blind and bands of that nature, you will love this. If you weren't too keen on the first album, you'll probably love this one. They do put on a good show, though so check 'em out if you can. Still waiting for the proper follow-up. Maybe next time guys."
3,Black Rock...If Their is Such a Genre,"I'm a pretty big fan of Darkthrone's earlier work, such as panzerfaust, Transylvanian Hunger, and Total Death, even the newest one The Cult is Alive is very well done. But this album makes me think of what it would be like if a standard rock band tried to do a few black metal cover's it doesn't work. If your new to the band or the genre, check out the other's I mentioned prior."
5,busy mom of 4 month old,"I thought this bag was the best find yet. Great for traveling, it worked wonderful on the plane as a carry-on for all baby's things. Also is great for overnight stays, etc...My favorite part of the bag is the spacious capabilities and the therma inside pocket, with a small frozen gel pack, it keeps bottles frosty for hours without worry.My only problem has been finding an everyday, moderately-priced, diaper bag that I like as much."
1,Waste of money,This lab manual is horrible. It is only sold at UGA so that the lab professor can profit off the students. Half of the experiments don't work.
5,Mambo Sons Review,"Mambo Sons (S.Lawson, T.Guerra, K.Aaronson, M.Hayden.)Every Inch Of This Music Is Solid, Clean, & Excellent Material. After Listening to The CD I Immediatly Was Focused On The Power Of Mambo Sons. I Am Delighted With Every Song On The Album! It Is Total Proof That Connecticut Musicians Rock. An Excellent Mix Of Every Style of Music, All Blended With The Master Touches Of Guests : Rick Derringer(Guitar)/ Collin Tilton(Sax)/ Alan ""POPS"" St. Jon(Keys, bk Vocals)/ Jimi Bell(Guitar)/ Joe ""THE CAT"" Lemieux,(Drums)/ Freddie Mac,(Hammond, Piano)/ Gina Gunn, (Bass,bk Vocals)/ E.M.

2,Barely readable,"I knew this was a facsimile edition when I ordered it. After examining it, I am asking myself why a facsimile edition of a 1920 edition of these essays is useful or desirable. As a curiosity, perhaps? As a treasure for Emerson admirers? If so, surely this facsimile edtion deserves more than its cheesy unsubstantial binding. And whatever its value, a book should be readable. This one is a challenge to the best eyesight because of the microscopic type."
5,excellent razors,Product was recieved as ordered. Razor really helps with razor burn/bumps.Would recommend this product to anyone who gets frequent razorburn issues.
1,dont bother if you are not in the USA,"I spent ages downloading all the things they told me to download so that I could watch these episodes. I got charged for the episode I wanted to view, then when I went to watch it, I was told that I could not watch it because of my location. Somehow, they figured that my computer is not in the USA and so therefore, I can't watch it. Its only avail to computers in the USA. If only they had figured out I wasn't in the USA at the time they charged me, and at the time they told me to download the viewer program then I could have saved a heap of time and some money. What a waste. Why on earth can't they just sell the seasons in boxed set, becasue not everyone gets the show in their country, and not everyone can work these new fangled download things - I just want to watch the episodes not take ten years off my life trying to get it through the computer. BOXED SETS - OF ALL THE SEASONS IS WHAT IS REQUIRED. PLEASE CBS PLEASE."
4,Good!,It's hard to find good Christian romance books- this book is really good! The continuation of the characters through the connected stories gives you a sense of finality in the end.Highly recommended.
3,"Pretty good, but could have been better...","Excessive verbiage is the main problem with the book--the other being that the author seems biased towards her subjects.An interesting account of the gypsies, their history, and life today, but I had hoped it would be broader in scope to include other parts of the world besides Eastern Europe."
4,"Fun GPS, Easy to use, but not the most accurate spoken directions.","Hello,I have been using this GPS almost every day for almost a year now, and am an expert on this thing. It's good for the price of $125 I paid, but would not go much more over that. The worse thing is that it tells you to turn in 100 yards, when it is actually 100 feet, It is off by a factor of 3-8 in calculating turn by turn directions. Othewise it is very easy to use, the screen is the perfect size for a large truck or SUV. Usually tracks 9-11 satellites due to the SirF III chipset. It is a good bargain , get it for the right price though. Many good options. Voices are British for the English spoken voices though. Maybe Austrailian? I am happy with this so far, Esy to load pictures and MP3's on the storage card as well, No other complaints."
3,E-Business Techologies: Supporting the Net-Enhanced Organization,"This book was one of the most difficult to read and understand. It spoke of advancements heading into 2003. This book is outdated and not written well, in my opinion. Used in a college class, this book was horrific when studying for an exam, because it just did not make sense as to the realities in technology today. There was not one student in my class that could read the book once or twice and comprehend the full extent of the information. A new updated book should be done, that reflects the current status of E-Business Technologies."
4,"Super quaity, nice looking and great extras!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I first bought another of this brand and brought it back to the store as the feedback was horrible. I saw this one and LOVED the extra USB ports in the stand of the screen. The picture is great quality and the 17 inch size is wonderful, the other was 19 and way too big it hurt my eyes. The colors and 8ms response time is great. I love the built in speakers so it doesn't need a lot of room since it is also a flat panel. Pc compatible and mac is also a plus. You never need a new screen and it comes with a 3 yr wattanty. What more can you ask for. I love this one. a keeper!!! P>S> the sound is only basic so if you are looking for speakers to bring down the house this is not for you but perfect for me 37 and just listening to music as I surf the net."
2,GO PLAY OTHELLO THEN!,The book is not so bad for a Basic starting point on how to play Go. My review is of the uneducated review calling the game of Go Othello. You have never played Go or Othello if you would make such an absurd remark.
4,Great Music,"Though I didn't particularly like her man hating first album (yes I'm a woman, but I don't hate men that much) this was a breath of fresh air. She has a nice mix of uptempo tunes along with beautiful ballads that showcase her voice well. Among my favorites are Faithful to you, So willingly, I'm gon' cry and a nice remake of If you play your cards right. Definite purchase, you won't be disappointed, unless of course you don't like music."
5,Cleo1956,I must agree no words can express the talent of this artist. Syleena first album in my opinion was outstanding and she has done her thing again. My favorites on this album are I believe in Love and So Willingly. I hope Syleena recieves the recognition she so greatly deserves this time out. If you're not familiar with her you must take a chance and buy this album. I promise you won't regret it! Much love to you Syleena.
4,old memories,i use to watch the degrassi high shows all the time and loved them. i cant wait to see them again.
5,COOL,"I like this set. Dad doesn't think that not-clear-boxes are a good idea. I agree. Still, it's cool. My brother likes Attacktix.So do I."
5,Simple Classic,"very nice, simple, classic phone that compliments my H-series headset perfectly. I've always trusted Plantronics brand because they're so reliable, I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4,Helped me see things from a different perspective,"I was really frustrated and angry with a family member who had so much potential, yet decided that she wanted to drop out of high school and hop trains. I never understood it and questioned her safety. Catching Out gave me a different perspective. We haven't reconciled yet, though I am sure we will when the time is right. That aside, I'd love to know how the cast is doing. I visited the website, which doesn't appear to have been updated in some time. Many of the links are broken. Bummer! :("
2,"Great stories, not great directions","The book doesn't have great directions for actually getting to the towns. The stories are ok though, pics are fine too."
2,Should not be your first choice,"I'm just getting into Jim Hall and bought this album after getting several others such as Concierto and his albums with Ron Carter. Compared to those, this is a very odd CD and isn't satisfying. Look for other better reviewed CDs first and get this to complete your collection."
4,great belt,"i spent 20 years in the military and missed having those adjustable buckles on my belt. so i ordered this product. while it is not quite up to military grade, it still looks and works fine. the smallest size being 44"" is more than enough room for me. not to worry you can adjust or even cut the belt to match your size."
4,Classy,Actually bought this for the wifes Nook color. Works great with the Nook color. She attaches the Styra to the cover of the Nook. Looks classy with the Nook color! A bit pricey.
3,Nice stylus,"I had hoped it would work for my iPad _and_ my Trackpad. Unfortunately, the touch sensitivity on the trackpad is a little different than the iPad and it doesn't work very well there. But as a stylus for the iPad, it's only advertised compatibility."
4,All folks said it would be,BoxWave Capacitive iPad Stylus (Jet Black)I did some research on the types of pens out there and this one kept coming up as superior. After having used it for about a month I can truly say it is all everyone said it would be. I am truly pleased with the purchase.
4,Working well for me!,"I am thoroughly enjoying the stylus so far. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but the fact that it matches my white iPad and is so sleek is perfect.Pro: small, easy to use, has worked well for a month and a half so far and is very clean looking. Lastly, the pen option is amazing and have used it several times.Cons: the cap can be lost, which can be a problem. Secondly, the material on the pen is a bit thin and I ahve noticed it being scratched a bit...however that is just me being picky. Compared to other styluses, this is definitely nice."
2,Came Apart After A Couple Weeks,I like the BoxWave Styra a lot but after only a couple of weeks use and even less use of the pen the Styra fell apart. Whenever I attempt to use the pen the insert that connects the cap with the barrel of the Styra pulls out of the Styra's barrel.I'll probably glue the insert in with some super glue but I shouldn't have to muck with a product as expensive as the Styra.I wouldn't buy another one.
5,Fantastic album!,This is one the best retro pop acts going. The vocals are superb and the song writing is sly and catchy. This is a keeper.
2,lookout! did it again,"when i first heard this album i was a little skeptical, even though its a little different from most lookout releases (especially older ones, but the newer ones too) with the spacey sounds and such, its still a solid album, full of good bass lines and the lyrics are well written. theres worse albums out there, but theres better too. 2 stars."
4,Viking! By Connie Mason,"If you like Connie Mason, or if you just like historical romance, you'll like this book. It has everything historical romance readers want."
2,Disappointing Read,"The hero and heroine have to be the slowest learners in the universe! Over and over they reject what they know and listen to people that have been proven evil--Would you believe someone who tried to kill you when she says she's looking out for your own good? A few of today's colloquialisms slipped into this medieval novel--Off Limits, for example. The situations become so contrived and far-fetched that it was ludicrous. The heroine has leverage to save one girl but not herself and another when all 3 find themselves in the same predicament? Disappointing."
3,Interesting at first,"This lady really was able to see God's grace when making the company. It's an easy read, but half way down you kind of get the whole point of what she's saying. It's a good testimony of God's love for her but she didn't need to make the book as long. I got the point!"
4,Only 2 stars??,"I bought this player 2 years ago ...in Japan and thought it was a bargin then. I still haven't changed my mind. With SD cards (Sun Disc) making 512MB and soon 1GB memory cards I can listen to my player for hours and hours. My only wish is that it was rechargabe like a cell phone as the hook that holds the battery door closed snapped off. Also, I can only get 5 hours of play time with 2 AAA batteries. Other than that, one of the best buys I ever made!!At (this price) it would be stupid not to consider this player."
2,Falls Apart!,"We bought this for our son to play with. He loves Dora...and we were excited at first, but that went away quickly. This thing falls apart! We can't keep the two islands connected, they keep coming apart, and the tree doesn't stay in the stand. And in ours, Swiper isn't seen very often. He doesn't spin around the way he's supposed to when we pour water in it. Very disappointed."
2,Terrible Tub Toy,This toy frustrates my daughter. She now only plays with the figurines because the palm tree never stays together and when you put it in the tub the ends float apart and the bridge falls off. The figurines hold water in them even though there are drain holes in their bases. It is really a terrible tub toy. The boat is durable but that's about it.
2,"Great ideas, definate flaws","I bought this toy for $4.99, so I don't feel as cheated....but it has some problems.CONS1. IT DOESN'T FLOAT VERY WELL! hello!2. The tree doesn't clip into the base in any way, so it is constantly falls off.2. The dolls have holes in the bottom. Once they are in the water, water is constantly coming out of them. You cannot play with them outside of the tub (not to mention the cooties growing on the inside and coming out when they are submerged.3. The boat won't stay on the tie off, very frustrating for a 3 year old.Pros1. It is Dora, which makes everyone smile :)2. They loved putting everyone down the slide.A great concept, just not designed very well at all."
2,Falls Apart,This bath toy is very cute - but falls apart when you look at it. My 3-year-old ended up giving up on the palm tree filled with water and Swiper the Fox simply because it fell over every second! She plays with half of the toy - the slide - and sets it on the side of the tub and makes all her friends slide down into the tub. Not worth the money.
5,great toy,"My dughter loved this toy and I never had any real trouble with the toy falling apart and with a little water in the tub it floated just fine. My daughter played with it daily until I tossed it for mold. Yes mold grows inside the toys after a while and the outside becomes funky, as with any tub toy. Also, someone complained about the holes in dora and boots, but that is what makes them squirt. As far as playing with it outside the tub, well I guess you need to choose if you want it to be a tub toy or a floor toy. I would not really expect to play with a tub toy out of the tub."
4,Met my needs,I have a Honda that only accepts this kind of card to get music into the navigation system. Not an easy product to find these days.
1,The most incompetently engraved music I have ever seen,"You may or may not care for ""Godspell"" -- for what it's worth, I'm rehearsing it right now. But before spending fifty dollars on this book, you should know that, despite the fact that it's been in print for 30 years, it is full of flat-out typos, misspelled accidentals, mislabeled parts, unexplained divisi, and other musical grekh. The publisher should be ashamed. If you plan to use this book for a performance, be prepared to spend many hours correcting it before rehearsal. (It is also often musically different -- even in the melodies -- from the Original Cast Album, but I don't know who was responsible for that.)As an example of how slovenly the engraving is, consider the word ""Stained!"" in ""We Beseech Thee"". In the first place, it doesn't read ""Stained!"", it reads ""Strained!"". But, more than that, it's on two notes, so what the score is actually telling you to sing is ""Strainèd!""."
4,"Informative, but a little confusing","I am currently an eigth grader and am using this book in my school's ""challengers"" program. I found the book filled with lots of examples on solving polynomials, mixture problems, rational square roots, etc. However, if one does not master the concepts from Chapters 1-6 (this covers everything from factoring plynomials, solving equations and problems, etc.) one will have a hard time understanding new material from Chapter 7 and on."
3,One of the Greats,"I was a mild fan of Simon & Garfunkel. Of course, I owned ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", ""Rhyming' Simon"" and my favorite, ""Graceland"". So when Amazon chose this as the ""Deal of the Day"", I couldn't resist. Songs like ""Mother and Child Reunion"", ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" and ""Kodachrome"" were 70s radio staples.But it was the magnificent ""Graceland"" where he embarked on a world music endeavor bringing some of the best of African culture to the mainstream.Songs like ""You Can Call Me Al"" is at once clever and then joyous. ""Graceland"" remains, hands down my favorite Paul Simon effort. While I was happy to add the other songs in this varied collection, chances are iffy that I won't be hitting the ""fast forward"" button through a lot of these songs."
4,Good,Like most of the songs. Brought back some nice memories. Would buy again. Give it a try. Thank you for offering.
4,Rare Gem,"This dvd is worth the purchase for the emotional intensity of ""I'll Look Around"" and ""For All We Know"". This is how music is supposed to sound: emotive and utterly original."
1,Nina Simone Live,I thought I ordered a CD - turns out I ordered a DVD. I have been trying to contact the vendor since I received it to determine how this item can be exchanged - no response. Very disappointed.
5,A MOST BRILLIANT AND COMPELLING BOOK,About 5 years ago I checked out Ryan's book in my local library. Never in my life had I been so touched by a person I didn't even know. I taped Ryan's movie and still have it on tape to this day. I think the book has a focus on the hardships that Ryan had to endure but at the same time his compelling attitude forces us to take a look at our own lives and see how good we really have it. I will forever miss Ryan. I would also like to say that I have become a huge Elton John fan after I seen all of the great things he has done for Ryan and his family and I now know why Elton was so much loved by Ryan both on a personal and musical level.
3,"MISS BADU, WHAT HAPPENED???","First off let me say that I am an Erykah Badu fan to the bone and could not wait to get off work to pick up Mama's Gun. To my shock I am disappointed. This cd is filled with lackluster songs where the music oftentimes outshines the vocals. Although Mama's Gun is not up to par with Baduizm or her Live cd it is not all bad; there are a few cuts worthy of play like ""Orange Moon"" which has a beautiful flute soliloquy. There's ""Bag Lady"" which has a different mix than the radio/video version which has a nice twist. ""Booty"" is reminiscent of ""Tyrone"" and ""Green Eyes"" which has trumpeter Roy Hargrove and flutist D'Wayne Kerr featured would make Billie Holiday smile. All in all after multiple listenings this cd may grow on ya. I'm still a fan."
3,What's Going On Ms Badu?,"I love Erycah Badu. Unfortunately, I did not love this CD. It is melancholy and uninspiring. The vocals were awful. I did like a couple of tracks like Didnt Cha Know and Orange Moon, but overall I was not impressed. To make matters worse, the Bag Lady radio edit was not included on the CD. I will most likely, however, support her future endeavors. I watched Badu walk out onto a stage in New Orleans, looking unmotivated and sad. I also watched as she threw herself into that performance, surprising me with one of the best shows I've ever attended. Mama's Gun is weak and I know she can do better."
3,Not sure about this one...,"I bought this cd as soon it was released, played it once and wasn't compelled to play it again. My biggest problem with ""Gun"" is the casual and frequent use of the ""N...""Word in most of the songs. It's a bit disturbing...not to mention confusing, because she goes on as one who's progessive and beyond such things --perhaps I thought wrong. I still like her talent though and look forward to better material from her in the future."
3,SOMETHING TO GET USED TO,"Well, for all you ""DIE HARD"" Badu fans out there, the wait it officially over. Unfortunately, you won't experience the INSTANT GRATIFICATION found on her debut effort: ""BADUIZUM"". Erykah tries a tad bit TOO HARD on ""MAMA'S GUN"", to display that she can infact be the ""NEW MILLENIUMS"" Billy Holliday. This is evident in tracks such as: ""GREEN EYES"", which is bueatiful in it's instrumentation, but becomes drawn-out and excessively layered, in addition to the fact that the song itself is 10-MINUTES LONG??? ""AD 2000"", which is not as extravagant, but shows that sometimes ""LESS IS BETTER"", is a delightfully dream-filled song, and it's acoustic sound, shows that Erykah has not only matured as an artist, but that she is also stepping into new ground musically. These are the DEFINITE HIGHLIGHTS of the album. Overall, ""MAMA'S GUN"" is not great, and will require a few listens for satisfaction, but one things for sure, Erykah is on a journey to find her ""ARTISTIC NICHE""."
1,It's just not worth it,"This is one of those albums you know you're supposed to like, especially since it features the same Soulquarians (especially ?uestlove) production that have made releases by D'Angelo, Common and The Roots so impressive. You have this feeling that if you can't appreciate ""Mama's Gun,"" it probably means that you are too tied down to the pop song structure and can't appreciate true experimentation. After some consideration, you realize that no, Erykah Badu is just overly in love with herself and doesn't really care to make music that actually sounds good. This album is more or less designed to make you feel obligated to appreciate what she did here, but don't waste your time, especially when you can listen to the Jazzyfatnastees, D'Angelo, Lucy Pearl, or Dionne Farris instead (of course the last three aren't likely to release anything anytime soon...)"
3,Ba-Humbug,"Oh geez, Badu is soooooo annoyingly pretentious. The album is a'ight but her personality gets in the way of what she's laying down.Yes, she can create a mood, yes, her vocal style is laid back and easy, yes I'd rather listen to Badu than Destiny's Child. BUT, she needs to chill out with her ""i am sooooo deep. i am such a creative powerhouse, telling the world its truths"" artiste schtick. She needn't hit us over the head with how (fakely) ""real"" she keeps it.AND she needs to stop biting. A la Lauryn Hill, Badu's record cover is a total bite of early 80s Rockers album covers. It's very similar to a Dennis Brown import. Yes, yes, we can tell the girl looooves reggae. So does Lauryn Hill. But y'all need to STOP BITING! I know, that's a petty nitpick, but the woman gets on my nerves."
2,Waste of money,"This carriage was a present to my daughter, Christmas 2004. She liked it until she attempted to play with it. The horses do not stay on the toy...the plastic strap to hold them in place is the problem. It's too flimsy. It now sits in her toy box, unused.Mattel had a good idea. Their follow thru leaves much to be desired, however."
1,Julian,Your advertising implies that there are four dolls. Why else would you have a carriage that seats four? The picture shows a blond Julian. We have hunted high and low to find a Julian only to be told he does not exist. I am very unhappy regarding the implication that a fourth doll is available. (...)
1,"Poor quality, prompt return to the store!","This toy is very poorly constructed. My daughter received this from Santa Clause yesterday morning. I told her he gave us permission to return it for a better toy, so this morning (the day after Christmas) we packed it up and took it back. If I had my way I would return the $100 castle as well but she wanted it so badly. There is no way to play with this toy without the horses coming apart from the carriage and falling over. Are the toy companies even testing things before they release them to the market anymore? Mattel needs to test their toys with actual children (to make sure they can even be played with) before they allow anything to be sold. As consumers, we need to let the toy companies know that we will not accept toys made under poor quality standards. The only way we can let them know that is to return items that are unacceptable or not buy it in the first place."
2,As Seen on TV,"I really wanted to like these cookies. The TV show, ""Unwrapped"", made them look sooo good. However, my family was gravely disappointed. They arrived in a huge paint can with a tiny little foil bag inside. When we took our first bite it was like eating a dry, breaded piece of citrus candy. A unique flavor, but not one our family appreciated."
4,j.walters,"very nice,comfortable,light sweater,crafted from fine Italian Merino wool.this wool is durable and resists pilling and does'nt itch like conventional wool."
4,******FUNNY******,My daughter loved this doll. She learned the songs and sang with Dora all around the house. The greatest part of it is that did did it so much my husband got anoyed and turned it off with out my daughter knowing it had a botton to turn it off. My daughter thought dora really had gone to sleep and she would tell it to wake up....The onl bad part about this doll is that I have not found a way to remove the night gown. My daughter has dragged it aong so much that it is very dirty. I am kind of glad she left it in her aunts house by mistake b/c I dont want her playing with it just because the gown cant be removed to wash.
4,Buyer Beware,"I have nothing against this four episode release from Critics Choice of the ""Sky King"" series . . . the episodes look fairly good (though far from pristine), the price is right, and a couple of the episodes even include original vintage commercials (a real plus among collectors). So why the ""Buyer Beware"" title? The episodes included on this DVD are the exact same four episodes that were released on another DVD from Alpha Video which Amazon also carries. Apparently, only four episodes from the series lapsed into the public domain and that's why multiple releasing companies are offering the same episodes.The four star rating is well deserved for this entertaining show that many of the Baby Boomer generation enjoyed during the 1950s and 1960s and can again, thanks to this DVD release."
2,Not for Everyone,"This book is really for Neo Pagans and Pagans. It's not a good book on incense making or incense in general. Recipes based on using saltpeter to make them burn come from the work of Cunningham, and are not traditional in incense-making. Saltpeter is one of the main ingredients of gunpowder, matches, chemically assisted charcoals and may be harmful to your health."
3,Good scholarship on a not-so good text,"Of all the Apocrypha, I must say the most forgettable may be the Wisdom of Solomon. The Platonizing of Judao-Christian religion was VERY detrimental to it's spiritual growth, and sadly; this document was a big contributer. However, it's influence on the Catholic Church and Mariology is VERY interesting and so it deserves a look. Many points to the scholars who devoted great time and effort to getting to the bottom of this much misunderstood text."
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR. It is horrible. All you hear is static. So much static that sometimes I don't even hear my baby. The lights are always going on because of the noise from the static but sometimes the lights don't work & ofcourse that is when my baby is making noise. I try to sleep with this on my night stand but can't because of the static. There are 2 channels. One has static and the other is the worst sound you will ever hear. This monitor makes me crazy listening to static all day & all night. I am going out tomorrow to purchase a new monitor. Don't waste your money. You get what you pay for!
2,Only good a few rooms away.,"I used the monitor alot when my daughter was napping at home and it worked fine. However, the 400 ft range is not accurate. We used it this summer while camping. My daughter is now 18 months and we wanted it while she took naps and went to bed in the camper. I could barely walk 100 ft from the camper and it would all be static. I would recommend spending a little more money for a nicer one unless its just for a room to room monitor."
4,Great Monitor,I am a first time mom so I have been very picky about the products that I have selected to use. I have to say out of all the monitors that I have researched this has got to be one of the best. I can hear my son clear as can be. I have found that in some areas of my home it does have a little static but if I just turn it a little the static is gone. I was most impressed with the fact that I could hear my son breathing with the monitor at leat 3 feet away from him. I can get a peaceful sleep knowing that this monitor is definatly going to pick up any noise that he makes.
4,The Glass Menagerie was a well written play.,"Some people did not think much of the play, but I thought it was an excellent play. The charecter laura in the play is a crippled girl who feels that she is unable to do anything because she is crippled. Laura keeps a glass menagerie and is very attached to it because she feels they are like her, fragile and transparent. One of the glass charecters resembles her because it is different from all the other animals. Tom, who is Laura's brother wants to leave his house and do something adventurous with his life, but can't until his sister finds a suitible match. Amanda is their mother, who feels self-pity because her husband left her and she has to take care of two children. She keeps reminding Laura of how she always had so many gentelmen callers and Laura has none. This play ended sadly but made a good point."
2,DOA,"This is one of ""those"" movies...you know, the ones released because the lead actor got famous somewhere else and the drawers of previous work is emptied. In this case, Molly Parker from Deadwood fame.I didn't connect the dots until I got it home, I gave it a try because it sounded creepy and I have deep roots in the funeral business. The best thing I can say is it's only 79 minutes. My finger hovered ""at the ready"" over EJECT for the entire flick. It's pretty low budget to boot. The casket props looked like leftovers from an old horror flick (trust me!) and the embalming school scene was shot at an empty junior college. No Pushover recommends dropping in at a stranger's funeral instead of watching this."
2,For true beginners only,"This is a very thin book, with little substantive information. If you know the rules of omaha and know how to read the board, you are a step ahead of this book. The only substantive information is regarding good starting hands, but it is mostly common sense. For the small price, you will get your money's worth only if you are a true beginner to omaha."
3,"Definitely NOT a scrapbook, but beautiful","This is a beautiful photo album, if that is what you are looking for. Definitely not a scrapbook. I wanted more of a scrapbook. If you are looking for an heirloom quality photo album than this is the one for you."
3,Great for teaching ideas,"Great for science teaching and project ideas grades 7-9... if you have higher level or younger kids, you need to do some serious modifying."
4,"Excellent book, deceiving genre","This book was a good read, but don't be deceived by the title/cover or Amazon's ""recommended also"" titles. The negative reviews seem to be concentrated on the fact that it wasn't erotic enough. Read Laurell Hamilton (I do!) if that's what you're after. This isn't an erotic thriller--more of a space adventure, and a lively one at that. No sex scenes in this or the sequel, but fun characters. The story is reminiscent of Anne McCaffrey's Catteni Sequence/Freedom books. They didn't have a lot of sex even though humans were pleasure slaves in that story too. Don't go into it with high expectations--just read it for a good story."
2,Needs to be redesigned,"My 2 year old daughter received this item as a gift. As a Dora nut, I figured she would adore this but we have come to find out that it just makes her upset. First, the bracelet is TINY! It barely fits around her wrist and is almost impossible to get on. The ring is huge and fits my size 7 finger. The necklace is bulky and heavy. Not only does it fall right off her because of its weight but it also barely fits around her neck because the chain is so short. She loves to pay with it but it makes her upset when she can't actually wear any of it. This definitely needs to be redesigned. Overall, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Excellent Handbook fo Advanced DIYers,This book has been an excellent handbook in working on a major remodeling project of our 15 year old house. Text is easily understood and the phtography of the worksite and the tools are crisp and easy to view. Both compliment one another. Am very pleased to have spent the money on this reference! I recommend it to all DIYers.
4,Very Good Book,"This is a very intresting book that gives you glimpses into what Rachel Scott was thinking and feeling and how she delt with them by her faith in God.However, it does bother me that this book is an adaptation of Rachel's journals and that the reader may not be getting the whole picture(and this only adds to my personal skepticism of some things surrounding her death and why she died) and this is why I gave the book 4 stars.Overall, this is a very good book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what Rachel Scott was thinking and feeling."
2,"It's ok, very overrated though","This album isn't nearly as good as most from other solid state bands. I really don't see why Demon Hunter has such big status in the Christian hardcore scene, there are a few good songs though, like ""my throat is an open grave"". Seriously, if you like this you should check out some Norma Jean, Underoath, Zao, Few Left Standing, Living Sacrifice, Beloved, Narcissus, or Unearth. Those are some good bands. And for the record, they sound NOTHING AT ALL like slipknot, I have no idea where anybody got that crazy, retarded thought in their head."
5,Spectacular heavy metal opus:)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tacky name aside, this disc is no one trick pony, but a self assured solid effort. The members are Christians, but those excpecting gentlemen restraint in their musical chops will be blown away by the abrubt and implosive tenacity of their musically feuled fire. This disc rocks harder then most treademark/generic heavy metal acts, and even though there have been some comparrisons to the likes of Slipknot(uh),these guys really rock with punch perfect precision in all varietal executions:production,vocals, songwriting and overall musical skill.No empty/barren filler here;the rock keeps a coming. True heavy metal dosen't get any more stronger, self-assured or focused then this. BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
2,Its OK...,"The CD has a few decent songs, but as a whole it bored me. Plus the CD was recorded at a low volume. It sounded like an 8-track in my vehicle, and I have a good system. It lacked bass, and mid-high levels were muffled. Just wasn't that good."
4,very satisfied,We live in a split level house so it is nice having a receiver in our living area and one in our bedroom. We do get a little static that I thought would be annoying especially at night but we got used to it the first night. I love that I can hear my daughter breathing (no more going in to check for breathing when she is sleeping!) I would recommend this monitor.
2,STATIC...STATIC....STATIC.....!!!!,"Did I say Static? I am on the second monitor, thinking something was wrong with the first one. Nope, still the same static roar as the first. it works as long as you are holding it. Put it down and you cannot hear anything. I am taking it back again and this time I will have a total different monitor. Like the clear and near. This was an absolute waste of time."
2,Started out ok but not anymore,"I registered to receive this item for our first child. At first it was great. All you had to do was barely turn on the volume and you could hear everything from her waking up to rolling over. It has been just a little over a year and it sounds horrible. The static is terrible. The minute you turn on the monitor, it makes a terrible roaring sound. After great research, we are now on our way to purchase a video monitor."
4,Great Monitor,"We have really liked this monitor. Once in a while we get some static, but if you move it around you can find a spot that works well. I like the lights in case the TV is loud. Overall, one of the most useful baby items we received."
2,Too much static,"I agree that this monitor has terrible static. It is so loud. It is better when it is plugged in but that isn't practical. Actually it is too sensitive. If I just watch the lights, it picks up every sound from other parts of the house. Spend the money & get a better one."
2,Ours broke at 18 months,"Maybe these aren't built for the long haul, but we're ready to trash ours at 18 months. They still work technically, but one receiver has horrible sound quality, and the other has off and on static and then cuts out completely depending on how the cord is positioned."
1,Horrible static,"After seeing so many positive reviews of this monitor, even that it was one of the ""must haves"" in a popular baby magazine, I was so disappointed once I got this home. Not only did we have static, we also had a horrible high-pitched squeal. Changing channels helped the squeal, but the static was still really bad. And I kept getting up out of bed to check on my daughter because I kept hearing a baby cry through the static - but it wasn't MY baby!! I guess it was the neighbor's child. Not once was I able to hear my own baby through this monitor!!We switched to the First Years 900mHz Attachable monitor (it hooks right onto the crib). What a difference!! Last night, for the first time since we moved our daughter to her own room, I was able to hear her sigh in her sleep and roll over!!"
2,I've had better,"This is my 4th baby monitor, and I can honestly say I like this one the least. My other ones were Safety First (I think that's the name).But I couldn't find that brand with 2 portable units, so I bought this instead. My other monitors were so clear I could hear the clock ticking in my daughter's room. This monitor I can only hear my daughter if she is actually vocal. Which kind of sucks. I also hear CB conversations. And I never did with my other monitors. It also is staticy. It does it's job, you do hear your child and a few other things you may not want to hear.But it's just not as sensitive as my others, and I miss hearing my little one sucking her fingers when she's in a deep sleep. Or sighing in her sleep, or yawning, all the cute little noises are gone. Well I can't hear them anyway!"
2,We went through two of these!,"We like Fisher Price, so we got a set. we got some static sometimes, but after a couple of months could hardly get anything but a blast of static! Also, we got feedback that was horrible if we opened the babies' door. We have twins, so we need both receivers to work if one was in bed and one of us in our room. Both sets have died by stopping completey or only getting awful static after a couple of months. Today I got a Graco monitor, so we will see. I will never get a Fisher Price monitor again, and do not reommend it at all!"
4,How to get rid of the static,"We got this as a gift and after all the static, we were ready to throw it out and buy something else. The static was so annoying!!In the meantime, I had to move the baby monitor a few feet so I plugged a surge protector with emi/rfi noise filter into the wall receptacle (that the baby monitor used to be plugged into) and then the baby monitor was plugged into the surge protector.Wow! Most of the static went away. I still hear a little static but it's very usable now and we don't need to buy another monitor."
1,Don't buy it!,"I usually am a fan of Fisher Price, but I have to say- don't buy this product. It worked well the first few weeks we got it, but over a year later, it only offers static, no matter what channel I set it. I wish I'd read the reviews first. I still trust their toys, but I'm very disappointed and frustrated with this monitor..."
2,Not worth it,"We bought this monitor when we moved to a 2-story house, and only used it at night. There was so much static that I could not turn the volume up very loud. We finally decided to buy a monitor that was a little more expensive when our older son had to come and wake us up at 3 am to tell us the baby was screaming, crying. We could not hear him because of all the static. I went out the very next day and bought another one. If you spend a little more money (about $20 more), you can get a good, clear, crisp sounding monitor."
3,Sleek looking monitors are nice,The monitors are nice looking and so a great job for the most part. The base is located upstairs and we have one receiver downstairs in the family room while the second receiver is located upstairs in our bedrrom. The downstairs recevier works great... the upstairs recevier has a constant hum or buzz to it no matter how low you turn the volume down. At first I thought that I had the wrong channel selected but that was not it. Maybe this is happening becuase it is only a short distance from the base?
1,Didn't work for us,"This monitor was recommended to us by a friend and I purchased it for the dual listening monitors and the fact that it had AC and battery power options. The big visual display also seemed like a plus.However, when we tried to use the monitor all we heard was interference. We tried switching channels and adjusting the volume and still only heard static or feedback. We have a lot of wireless equipment in our house and my husband thought that might have something to do with it not working. I ended up returning the monitor to the store. Since then I purchased a Graco monitor and have had no problems with static."
1,annoying monitor,"I am completely annoyed by this monitor. It makes a constant static white noise that drives us crazy, plus it picks up radio waves and we hear the beating of a drum late at night. I would not reccomend this monitor."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I was given this as a baby shower gift. Its reception is HORRIBLE! All I can hear is static, no matter what channel I use or where I place it in my house!! The static is so loud, you can barely hear the baby. Also the on/off switch is impossible to use. I am returning this today to try a different brand!"
1,Too much static,This monitor started off fine but within 6 months was static all the time- it actually kept my husband up at night. I threw them away and bought Sony monitors. So far they are great! Don't get these!!
2,Lots of static,"I thought this monitor was pretty good (I've been using it for 12 months now) until I visited a friend in Colorado. Her monitor (First Years) was so silent I had to check over and over that they were on. That doesn't happen with these ""Sound n Lights"" monitors, there's so much static I always know they're on!"
2,"Items were not the ones shown in the picture, disappointed","Promptly shipment but items received do not like the picture shown in the web site which has a hen chicken shown on the top. Instead It comes. from Orville redenbachers. It is different item than the web site show. I specifically look for the ones with chicken logo brand. Disappoint, I have already bought several Orville brand. I really do not like what I received. Waste shipping $9 to get this."
4,Nice case for my casio camera,Protects like it should and it's easy to carry around. Little pricy but the camera makes it worth the price. Would recommend to everyone who spent >$200 on their casio camera!
3,Defeats the purpose of a slim camera,"It is a high quality case (full marks there). However, I have 2 issues:a) I cannot help being stupefied at the large size of the case, when you consider it is meant for Casio exilim cameras, of which I believe mine (EX-Z850) is one of the thickest and I still don't need such a chubby case. The case effectively doubles the size of the camera, which is a huge turnoff for me. That extra pocket in front is a complete waste because I have a 1GB card and don't expect to want to carry around anything extra. I returned it and bought myself a ""CASE LOGIC TBC-1 Compact Digital Camera Case"" which is available on amazon, but $2 cheaper at Circuit City (no wait, no shipping). I'd recommend this case over the Casio, even if you buy it on amazon for convenience.b) Humungous as it is, it is still too short for my EX-Z850 for the magnetic clasp to close over it reliably. I'm fumbling for 20 seconds before I can get it to shut reassuringly."
2,Nice but not very practicle.,Bought this for my Casio Exilim EX-Z1000. Perfect fit for everyday use at home. Downside: will not protect camera from dust and other fine particle.
2,Full of holes,"There is one and only one reason to watch this movie: To see beautiful people getting ripped to shreds by nasty aliens. That's it. The special effects are amazing, but the plot and acting are absolutely horrible. What grade do you have to pass to become a general in the future? Ever heard of TANKS? We had those in the 20s, but somehow forgot how to build them in the future. At least our heroes had grenades and rocket launchers. Too bad they almost never used them. Overall NOT the movie to watch if you want to know ANYTHING about military strategy, but the bugs are cool."
4,Has to be seen a few times...,"I hated this movie the first couple of times I watched it, but the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. It's got evrything that makes a good sci fi action flick. Giant bugs, big starships, big guns, legions of troops, etc. The plot seems really weak at first, but after a few viewings, the plot seems more sound. All in all this is a pretty goofy film, but it is a lot of fun to watch. One warning though, this is an excessively violent film with lots of blood and gore"
5,Great Sci-Fi! Great action! Pure entertainment!,"This is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies. I had to buy this one to go with my collection of favorites. and I only buy movies when I think they are good enough to watch over and over again! Some people may think ""people killing big bugs?-GEEZE?"" but this is really a good movie. If you do not like Sci-fi...don't waste your time..this is a true sci-fi lover movie. ENJOY!"
2,"Great special effects, Horrible acting and story line.",The story stinks but it has the best special effects I've everseen. The film is worth watching once or twice for the effects but only those who have been raised on MELROSE PLACE and 90210 will think it is an outstanding story.
1,If there's an actor in this film could someone identify them,I have never seen a major film with worse acting. Denise Richards is another Hollywood tart with no talent. The lead actor Casper Von Airhead another no talent. What is there to reccomend? Cool bugs
2,starship bloopers...,"As long as you dont take it too seriously this is not a bad flick. Its your typical 1990's sci-fi with lots of special FX and ....bugs,thousands of them,big yellow green blue horrible brain sucking mothers.Not for the faint-hearted. There is also the one-take-only co-ed shower scene in which the director had to firmly encourage his actors.A pleasant but brief interlude in an otherwise ordinary matinee movie.Not for the kids..."
3,No Metaphore! BUGS!!!!,This was a great sci-fi movie. I had a movie party at my apartment and has one pretentious fellow instantly start raving about what a great metaphor the movie was for the failures of democracy and the evils of communism. Needless to say we pummeled him with popcorn because theirs nothing deep about this film even though the novel it was based on was a political satire. The movie has big mean bugs and big explosions and that's what you rent it for. People who say it's a bad movie are just being dumb for renting it because they're looking for a plot in a rockem' sockem' robot movie.
3,It's OK,"OK film, good effects and acting. It doesn't have much in common with the Robert Heinlein book, but it's still a decent quality movie. If your a fan of the 'colonial marine' type books and movies, you're sure to like it."
4,This is a so bad it's good movie.,"This movie is almost NOTHING like the book it is based on. It's a Paul Veerhoven explosion of ideas all thrown into the blender and set to frappe. It is chock full of bad acting but has great effects. Love it or hate it, you must own it.Also it looks and sounds great on Blu"
1,why'd the girl have to die?,"this movie would've had about three more stars if the girl hadn't have gotten killed! I mean, it's bad enough that there's enough violence in this movie to make Braveheart look like 'Barney', but why did the guy have to end up being lonely. And another thing, the girl died a HORRIBLE death! She had things sticking all in her and there was blood coming out of her mouth. And she was ugly and pale in her casket. The rest of the movie was stupid and unrealistic, so she could've gone down beautiful. She was a very beautiful girl. I know that it's just a movie and I shouldn't be getting all worked up about this, but it's the principle of thing, guys! Come on!"
4,"Who Says this has to be accurate, it's FUN!!!","Gore, Gore, and more Gore to please the fans of Splatter, Robocop, Swat Kats and Total Recall. The Story deals with Alien Insect creatures who battle against Humans in a bloody war, it's a Entertaining and wild Sci-fi Ride that will make sure you have a strong stomach....END"
1,Will not play on a Panasonic DMP-BD85K,"I own 55 Blu-ray discs, a this is the first one that will not play on my Blu-ray player. I order two of these discs, and I had to send both back to Amazon for a refund. This player will not play this disc:Panasonic DMP-BD85K WiFi Enabled Blu-Ray Disc Player (Black)"
4,DIDN'T EXPECT THIS FILM WOULD BECOME ICONIC,"But having bought the laser, then the DVD and now the BluRay, this new format reveals deep dark depths of philosophic considerations to ponder. With even profound political comments too.The print/sound are excellent+. The action, of course,superb; the gore in BluRay pops, literally.All that said, I have to tout a future-war film with all those elements with 50% more IQ points and extraordinary production (including a top-notch script) scifi epic that's perfect:Amazon's product link insert isn't working today, but do look up THE CHRONICALS OF RIDDICK. Concept, art direction, production qualities are superlative. It's a far finer flick of future fighting. I've watched it a dozen times and it never fails to awe me.Get both movies; each in their own way, top of their respective genre`."
5,This is the movie that diserved the Visual Effects OSCAR,"C'mon, I know Titanic was expensive, but the special effects in this movie are state of the art (simply the best I've ever seen). But, since Titanic was more expensive. The special effects aren't the only thing, the screenplay is incredible and the actors are ""acceptable"". And the actors are well-chosen ones. Michalel Ironside is simply incredible with his army sadistical look, and Casper Van Dien was ""a good soldier"". I saw this movie four times and I didn't get bored, 'cause the action is unstoppable. It's just shooting and flying, but with style. And the bugs... oh the bugs. I'm sure you wouldn't like to meet a Tanker Bug face to face, hehehe."
4,Good movie!,I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it! I think it is worth buying! Good to have in your collection
4,Interstellar Marine exterminators: Hoo-ah!,"Great sci-fi. Human civilization clashes with bug race. Glorifies sexual promiscuity, women in military.Majesty: 5/10Execution: 8/10Taint: 2/10Total: 16""Majesty"" measures how much glory, beauty, and truth the film attains, meaning serious films do better. ""Execution"" measures overall quality given the basic idea, penalizing for problems like plot holes or lame special effects. ""Taint"" measures degree of corruption by liberal ideology.Total score = 2 * Majesty + Execution - .5 * Taint^2, rounded up.[...]"
2,Good FX bad everything else...,"The graphics were great. But my problem is the tactics that were invloved. The ONE and only scene where the humans use air attack they obliderate the bugs, and the rest of the movie they (humans) use ground attacks and just get killed. Would a real army use no air warfare. I don't think so!!!!!"
4,"Heinlein spins in his grave, but that's OK!!","The movie bears little resemblance to Robert A. Heinlein's classic book. But that's OK, because director Paul Verhoeven finds more creative ways to gruesomely kill people than in this movie than in any other movie I've seen. Bloody, intense fun! Those people who complain about the obliteration of RAH's admittedly contoversial political philosophy missed the point of this film. Verhoeven never said he wanted to pontificate about future society...he just wanted to impale people really good!!! Oh yeah, and about the removal of the robotic suits Heinlein fans seem so obsessed about: Verhoeven ditched the robo-armor because the special effects required would double the cost of the film. In my opinion, concentrating on the bug effects was the right way to go. Go ahead and see this movie, but leave the kids at home. Definitely worth renting, to buy it is up to you."
2,Good specials effects but no more,"The visuals effects made by industrial light & magic are excellent but the script is so simple that fall down in the middle of the story. The actors are pretty bad and the direction is not under control. Well, if you are a fan of the specials effects, you will enjoy but if you are a person who like a movie with a good story, you will hate that."
3,Eh...,"Some book-to-movie adaptations are well-executed. I can't say this is one of them. I saw this movie a long time ago, and read Robert A. Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers' later, and the book is SO much better than the movie! The book discusses a lot of philosophy - child-rearing, patriotism, military attitudes, citizenship, war, etc. It really is an awesome book, and I highly recommend it to anyone.The movie is lacking in the genius of the book. Bit of trivia - while in the movie Dizzy was a girl, in the book, Dizzy was actually a man, a minor character who died fairly early on in the book. The film is more about adventure and special effects, the story itself doesn't have much substance. Seriously, read the book."
3,satire saves a dismal wreck,"This was a bad movie. Had it not been for the title, I wouldn't have had a clue this was even based off the book. The plot and tone bear little resemblance. The plot-related sins are forgivable; however, the atmosphere is the fault of the actors. They can't act. Period. I could forgive the excessive violence and fascination with computer graphics (the bugs grew very boring after reptitive appearances) as a ""guy"" thing, but I cannot forgive the actors for turning a so-so movie into a dismal, superficial farce of the ideas the director was trying to convey. The periodic emergence of those themes in brief, biting satirical propaganda paradies were the movie's one saving grace, and the only way I was able to sit through the thing. I'd say watch it just for those; they were an absolute hoot."
2,Heinlein would cry if he saw this.,"This movie is based...loosely...on the great science fiction novel of the same name written by Robert Heinlein. The book is an all time sci-fi classic about honor, politics, government, and personal struggle. The movie is a ""90210"" type parody of this great work. The movie is technically fine, with good special effects and plenty of gore. The story in the movie is silly and soap opera compared to the book. The movie is a waste of your time if you are looking for the great substance science fiction is capable of. If you want blood, gore, brief nudity...then have at the movie."
2,"Good special effects, but bland acting","This movie bored me pretty quickly. The fighting scenes were a little drawn out, & too fake-gory to take too seriously. Not to mention some actors (AHEM, denise richards) need some acting lessons. It's got something for everyone I guess. Special effects I suppose would be the only saving grace, cuz the story line is pretty boring & predictable. Good looking cast for members of the opposite sex to both drool over (if you like the totally fake pretty ditsy types anyway), & at least Casper Van Dien's character did it some justice. I got most frustrated in some scenes where some of the characters should've died a LONG time ago, yet somehow nothing happens to them (ahem, denise richards). Ya, so movies aren't supposed to be realistic, but c'mon!! Worth watching for the fighting scenes, but everything in between, you're not missing much by doing something else."
4,really fun movie,"if you want a deep and meaningful experience, get one of those boring foreign films. if you want one of the most fun action sci-fi movies around, get this. some of the best digital effects i have ever seen are in this movie (hence the nomination for best visual effects). this movie was not meant to be symbolic of anything. it was meant to be a good time at the theater."
1,Wake me when it's over!!! <Yawn!!>,"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, George Lucas made the best Sci-Fi film (Series)of all time. Twenty-some years later, a Luke Skywalker wannabe, named Caspar, played a role in the worst Sci fi film ever made. When movies compare themselves to Star Wars, they open up a can of jellied whoop a**. Independence Day is the movie that got away with it. Starship Troopers (aka. Bug Squadron) doesn't even come close. One thing comes to mind when viewing this film- ""Who---what---where----when????"" and ""Huh?!?"". The movie tried to butch up by showing some ugly a** nude scenes, and a gross-out vomit scene (or chunky beef soup and soda pop being spat out) Some movies inspire us to make our own movies; this one inspires me to make my own gravy."
1,'Melrose Place in Space with a few bugs',"I watched this movie expecting a good action movie, with good special effects. And what did I see??? A soap opera with a few bugs. 1 1/2 hours soap opera / 30 minutes good special effects. So, if you like soap operas: watch it. If you do not like soap operas: do not watch it."
1,"Sorry, I just don't see the relevance","The first time I saw this I was sort of impressed. You know, the action, the FX, the over-the-top stereotypes put in to provide some kind of moral message. Then someone handed me the book. After that, I saw the movie again just to make sure. Yep, just garbage, and that's putting it lightly. Bad acting, cruddy adaptation of the novel, simple minded moralizing that probably wouldn't convince a hippy of the evils of war. But its relevant, right, since it trashes the military. Ok."
1,"TRASH, pure and simple",Garbage heap of a movie made by folks who obviously didn't understand a single word in Heinlein's book. Just to clarify: Heinlein was NOT a warmonger or facist. Get real folks. Better sci-fi in Battlestar Galactica.
3,See it for the battle sequences,"Yes, the tactics are foolish and unrealistic, but it's the exciting battle scenes with their fabulous special FX that are the meat (bloody red [or green] meat, actually) of this movie. Not for the squeamish, but if you have the kind of sensibility that can revel in the FUN of mass slaughter, especially when so well choreographed and directed as it is here, you'll get a kick out of ""Starship Troopers"".It's been many years since I've read the novel, but Heinlein was certainly a right-winger (not, I think, a fascist*) and Verhoeven is definitely not, though his pointing up of the evils of fascism is rather obvious, in my view.It's a slick production, concentrating more on how great things LOOK rather than whether they make sense, but let's face it, there hasn't been a really intelligent science fiction movie since ""Forbidden Planet"".*Compare how Orson Scott Card handles a similar topic in his great novel ""Ender's Game""."
4,It's a fun movie.,"I saw the movie and read the book. I think the movie took about as much as it could from the book. For instance, I don't think the characters could interact very well jumping around in super spacesuits. The book is excellent, the movie is also. The only reason I am giving a 4 star rating is because we didn't get to meet Carmen's twin sisters."
1,"Starship Troopers, the movie? No, thank you!","This movie is one of the worst science fiction movies ever made. Aside from the good special effects, it has nothing else to offer. The story is childish at best, and has almost nothing in common with the Heinlein book. I even felt sorry for the money I gave to go to the cinema and watch it! END"
1,This movie is full of crap,"This movie is full of crap it is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The actors in this movie could not act worth crap. this movie had a really stupid ending. The whole movie was just really dumb, now I am not saying I do not like Sci-fi movies but this movie was just really stupid... If I could rate this movie any lower I could but I can't so One star will do, if I could I would rate this movie with negative stars I would."
1,You have got to be kidding...,"The book was great. The movie sucks. Vast hordes of bugs bent on planetary conquest? Where are their ships? How can they throw rocks across over 60,000 light years of space to hit the Earth? The human soldiers don't even know how to use tactics, their spaceships don't know the meaning of the word 'dodge' and by the end of the film I feel sorry for the bugs! The whole thing looks like a set up to me by the humans to start a war (but frankly that would give the film some kind of plot). There are no powered-suits, the training camp is a twisted, darker version of the one in the book and the generals in charge seem to forget that the idea is to win the war not just fight it."
4,Starship Troopers,IF BATTLING WITH SPACE ALIENS IS YOUR FORTE AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET ALL I CAN SAY IS: WHAT PLANET HAVE YOU BEEN ON?
1,Yuck! What dreck!,"This is a terrible movie. Like Monsignore, it was like being on the set of Mystery Sciene Theatre, as the bulk of the audience heckled the poor plotline, writing, acting. My favorite line was delivered by one of te nubile young women as she lay dying. I won't give it away, you really have to see it in its context to appreciate its absurd impact. The whole psychic Doogie Howser stuff was inexplicable,and I kept rooting for the various characters to get killed by the bugs. Heinlein is one of my favorite writers, but this movie was pure dreck and drivel."
2,Mocks the book on which it was based.,"This movie is the liberal reaction to the book. This can especially be seen in the short films that litter the story. It makes fun of Heinlein's ""militarism"" by turning him into a jingoistic straw-man, following the well worn Hollywood groove of hating the armed forces and pretending that war is a silly game played by overgrown 9 year old boys.Here is a little Latin from Napoleon for you Hollywood:Si vis bellum para pacum."
1,"Horrible, disgusting, nearly worthless film","An insult to one of the better science fiction books written by Robert Heinline. This film totally misses the point of the book (which was a study on both the nature of politics and on the future of warfare). Instead we get some really cute young boys and girls and some really disgusting deaths and maimings and some (it must be admitted) spiffy special effects of space armadas and alien insects.The plot of this film makes just about no sense. Character motivations are trivial and dull.Worst of all: there are no starship troops in powererd armor! Why didn't they call this film ""Starship Lookers (get eaten by bugs)""?The director (Verhoven) hasn't had a good idea in 10 years. Why Hollywood film companies still let him spend millions of dollars to produce junk like this, well, that's Hollywood for you."
1,Awful,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Its special effects are unrealistic and cheesy. The plot is so thin, it's transparent. I turned it off less than halfway through. I love science fiction and fantasy movies, but this one just isn't worth the time."
1,Poor military tactics used in film,"The military tactics used by the starship troopers are inept and ludicrous. Rather than sending infantry with light caliber machine guns, all that is needed against these bugs is tanks and armored vehicles. Instead of dropping of infantry to fight the bugs the aircraft should strafe and bomb the bugs from above out of reach. Air power could have probably won the whole war. For being a futuristic film, the tactics used are pre-world war I. A few laser guided bombs to the bug holes could wipe out the bugs with no casualties."
1,Unquestionably the worst movie ever made.,"The title says it all.This movie is so bad, it actually causes me physicl pain whenever I catch sight of it on cable."
1,"Utter, Complete, Shameless TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I've heard that Robert Heinlein's wife actually signed over the right to Starship Troopers to Columbia/Tristar Studios when they were looking for an idea for a invading alien movie. I'd love to get my hands on her so I could scream at her for a couple of hours. I hope that she's ashamed of herself!If you haven't seen it, there is another series out based on Heinlein's Starship Troopers. It's done in CGI and actually sticks to the spirit of the story while updating the story."
1,"Excellent Book, Movie/Video missed the whole point.","The book presented a realistic soldier's life, in a future where one earns one's citizenship by serving the Government, in either a military or civilian capacity. Part of the impact of the book, is that, not until the very end, does the reader learn that the protagonist is Filipino. In the film, while this surprise identity would be difficult to conceal, the protagonist has been changed to a blued-eyed Anglo type, in the Hollywood tradition. The film is not science fiction. It is pure camp, fraught with cliches."
2,"Good effects, weak plot, violence galore","The special effects are really, really good: those big bugs seem to be truly there. The plot is almost preposterous: finishing off those bugs in their home planet would have been a piece of cake, even with current technology (assuming one could actually get to that planet.) I thought the explicit violence was sickening in several instances, but the fascist subplot was absolutely the worst thing: Verhoeven always manages to make something sordid and sinister of his plots (recall Robocop, Basic Instinct, or the ghastly Showgirls.) I was appalled to see in the theater families with young children. Talk about desensitizing children."
2,Not great,"I use these picks sometimes in the rock-band class I play in. They are okay picks. Nothing great. Don't expect great tone out of them or anything. This type of plastic give the strings a darker tone. Another set back to these picks is that the medium size, I'm guessing about .6mm wears down very quickly. The type of plastic does not last long, and after about 20 minutes of straight playing it with become scratchy and uncomfortable to use."
1,irresponsible,"I recently placed an order for a few similar things, and this one got separated from the other seller. The cost was $4.99, the shipping was $5.99. The 12(?) picks came loose in a box big enough for a toaster oven. It's not that it could have been sent in a $.41 letter, but the arrogance to waste all that material is inexcusable. ."
2,Gambled and won!,"I had read the other reviews about the picks falling out of the box, but thought I'd gamble for $3.14. When I opened the box there were NO picks in the pick pack, but searching through the box, and taking the box apart, I found all 12 picks! Even though some were sticking out of the bottom flaps about to fall out. My lucky day, but I would not recommend it."
2,"Great picks, poor shipping","I read several reviews here before I bought a set of these but didn't heed the warnings. Amazon just throws the set (which comes in a flimsy pop-open clamshell case) in a box to rattle around, open up, and fall out of the top/bottom flaps. So 9 of the 12 picks actually arrived at my door, which is better than most, however 4 of them I found under the bottom flaps of the box just waiting to fall out. The oddest thing is that I thought I was safe since I ordered 4 things at once but they shipped them in 2 separate boxes; in 1 box the items were shrink-wrapped together (and there is no real way the items could have fallen out of the box or been damaged from shipping) and the one with the picks was not shrink wrapped. ???Great picks, just don't order them from here since it's a well known issue but amazon just doesn't seem to care to fix the problem."
3,SoSo,"Product works great, but will eventually break at the power connection like the original. If you do any research, this is an ongoing problem with this product. It is in need of a redesign by Magellan."
2,"Good GPS, bad cradle","I've got a Roadmate 800 something. The Gps is great when it works. The Suction cup mount and cradle it comes with likes to fall off the windshield. Therefore, the GPS unit hits the floor with the power cord still attached. Eventually, the power end must have broken the small pin inside the unit that supplies power. I bought the replacement, and the unit works again.Magellan has a superior GPS technology, but design and durability is not that great. I also have a TomTom unit that is easly upgradable, and pretty stable on the windshield, but the software doesn't give me the same directions as the Magellan, but this is a review about the cradle. What can I say, if your cradle is broken, you MUST buy this one, but that doesn't make it better, just necessary."
2,CRADLE IS WORST,"I BOUGHT MAGELLAN 700 & CHANGED 3 CRADLE SO FAR.IF CRADLE WORK GOOD, YOU HAVE THE BEST UNIT.I WISH IF MAGELLAN IMPROVE CRADLE QUALITY & LIFE."
4,Slight 1970's band showing the way for many 1980's bands,"Roxy Music / The best of... : The band had several good and entertaining hits in the 1970's with a style that greatly influenced many bands in the 1980's. This CD has those hits, and several of their lesser songs. Eighteen songs in a single Hits CD is pretty good, but for this band, eighteen is too many. Four Stars"
3,A half decent effort,"Roxy had two careers:From 1972-75, Roxy Music were weird and very different from most rock bands of the period. They also had one of the best live acts in the UK, although this version of Roxy was not succesful in the States. Tracks 9-17 cover the great years, but strangely the Thrill Of It All one of their best songs has beeen omitted. The 1977 Greatest Hits album, which is no longer available, was a good summary of this period. In my view the live album, Viva! which was recorded 1973-75 captures them at their magnificent best.For some reason Brian Ferry decided to become a lounge singer and from 1979 released three dull, slow, over-produced MOR albums and used the Roxy name. Tracks 1-8 represnt this period. In my view this stuff is awful, but that is a matter of personal taste."
4,Soft and Cuddly,"Our two year old grand daughter really likes this soft and cuddly doll. As soon as she saw it, she exclaimed, ""Dora!"" and gave it a hug. Really can't say it's educational, but it's well made and she likes to play with it. Dora has no sound so it's great for quiet moments, like bedtime."
1,Useless cable,"I do own this cable;it came with the Magellan Roadmate that I bought a couple of years ago.The cable would be used to connect the Roadmate to your computer in order to download a newer version of the built in maps from the Magellan website; unfortunately, Magellan has never updated the original supplied version and apparently has no intention of doing so since newer versions of the Roadmate have been produced by Magellan.That makes this cable virtually worthless. Good idea-bad implementation."
5,So Much Fun!,My daughter received this as a gift when she was about 14 months old. At that time she was really only able to enjoy the setting where you make up a song by pressing the different instruments to go with the background rhythm section. Now that she is 2&1/2 she loves playing with all of the settings. She has loved this toy! It has been dragged with us to many picnics and has never given us a problem!
1,USELESS,"This item was of no use to me. My baby was in it a total of 2 times. It was not soothing to her at all. In fact, it made her cry louder. I was going to give it away to a friend but noticed that it was broken. It's very flimsy. Don't buy it."
2,Outgrown in a month,"My husband and I thought this bouncer would be great for outdoor summer events. Especially since our son was born at the beginning of June. By the end of July, at 22 inches and 11 lbs, he could no longer lay comfortably inside. The back nearly touched the floor even with the inside zipper closed. He's quite the mover and shaker and actually flipped the bouncer over once. On that note, we took it back to the store."
3,Problem in manufacturing...?,"I just re-read the reviews for this bouncer. I ordered it several weeks ago and assembled it a few days ago. To our dismay the vibration /sound unit was defective. The nature sounds worked but no vibration. Much like ""Baby Enthusiast"" from Columbia, OH, we tried several different batteries and nothing worked. I had to make several attempts at getting through on the customer service line (constant busy signal) before I actually talked to someone. The customer service representative was very friendly and informed me that they would be shipping out the new part, however it is on back-order and will probably take 4 weeks. If the part is on back-order it makes me wonder if this is a manufacturing defect that needs to be addressed before anymore bouncenettes are sent out to customers. I like the bouncenette but will not be able to use it for what I wanted when our baby arrives which could be any day now."
1,Boring Bouncer,"I registered for this bouncer because it has the screen that zips all around it. I thought the product would be a good way to entertain my son and protect him from being bothered by my cats. Well, the screen worked to enclose my son in the bouncer and the cats didn't bother him, but my son hated to be in the bouncer for more than 2 minutes. This bouncer is dull and boring. The color is neutral and matches the Eddie Bauer bassinet, but the color does not seem to be appealing to a baby. The nature sounds are nice, but the mobiles that are attached to the top of the bouncer are not very attractive---my son pretty much ignored them. The vibration of the bouncer wasn't enough to soothe my baby---he would cried after being in the bouncer for just a couple of minutes. My son preferred the motion of a swing to the vibration of the bouncer. For my next child, I plan to get a bouncer that is more colorful and inviting."
1,No Good,My daugter hated this thing. I registered for it because I had registered for the entire Eddie Bauer line but after putting her in it realized how unpracticle it is. Doesn't contour to her at all and she wouldn't last more then 5 minutes in the thing. Thankfully she liked the swing. Sold the thing on ebay and won't even bother with a bouncy seat with her little brother that will be here anyday.
1,"Thought this was Pretty, but...","I was excited that you can zip this closed, I have a 2yr old and wanted to protect my newborn. But I just assembled this and discovered it falls foward without much effort. If they modified the angle a bit this problem would go away. I don't recommened this bouncer. I am taking ours back and exchanging it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,It was cool on the stand in the store. Our daughter stopped using it after 1 month. She hated it. I wish we bought a regular bouncer seat instead.
2,Not stimulating...,Not an ideal seat overall. It reclines too far back. I had to insert blankets to support my son's head to enable him to see out. Also he is 7 months now and one of the buckles just snapped off?I also didnt like the non-stimulation factor. Neutral colored over-hang toys dont offer any stimulation. I ended up adding my own colorful toys and hanging them to keep him amused.It looks adorable & simple but isnt practical in my opinion.
2,Waste of Money,This is not comfortable for a baby and the ocean sounds are horrible. Any of the other bouncers are a better choice.
1,Not worthy of the Eddie Baur Name,"I was disappointed by this product. It should fit a child upto 25lbs and my 10lb baby has already outgrown it. The slightest bump would set off the ""soothing sounds"" that sounded more like screaching birds over static. The zipper kept getting caught in the mesh and was difficult to transition from reclining to sitting up. The harness is a one-size fits all and cannot be adjusted."
3,Great for outdoors,"This bouncer worked great for us at picnics during the summer. The net kept our son safe from the bugs. The only downfalls are:*The noises sound a little weird. Not very comforting*The back is a little hard*My son slouched too far to the side when not in recline postitionOther than that, it was fine. We used it as a bassinet at my mother's house for a while. It folds nicely for storage and transporting."
2,eddie bauer bouncer,i live in a heavily wooded area and needed to protect my 2 month old from the bugs while i worked outdoors. but i put it together simple enough.. but already one of the legs was broken. the left side of the thing almost touched the ground. i had to keep the left side zipped and the right side unzipped to get it to lay half way even..and put a blanket under her left side so she doesn't slip in the side of it. she is now 25 inches long and 4 months old.. she no longer fits in the thing. really really bad investment. i used it 3 maybe 4 times. it was such a struggle to get the thing zipped in the first place!! i just bought one of those nets you can put over the infant car seat and i use that.. 5.00!! beats 50.00 any day!
3,"just ok, you can do better","The best thing about this bouncer is the net cover. my son is 10 weeks old and already growing out of it. I barely got any use of this item. He always cries in it a lot, I don't think it's comfortable. The colors of the toys are very bland, I don't even think he knows they are there. I would look into something your baby can get more use out of."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I thought this would be a great item, but I was mistaken. It's too confining unless you have a baby less than 20 inches long. The toys hang in an awkward position. Once my daughter started kicking, she kept hitting the bottom of the bouncer which annoyed her rather than soothed her. We ended up returning the item and digging out our son's bouncer from 11 years ago. She loves the cheap, old bouncer much more than the 50 dollar one. Save your money."
2,Disappointing,"I came across this book at a discount book store and that's where I should have left it. Thank goodness I only gambled an dollar on this disappointing piece of literature. The author (too many times) confused me with her plot changes. Although they are relevant, the set up could have been written better, maybe by chapter rather than by random paragraphs? I read often and was surprised with how confusing this book was. It was hard for me to identify with some of the main characters because of how little Mrs. Croft spent writing about them. I would have liked to have known more about Moon's son. Overall it's definitely a book to pass up. It's always unfortunate when the brief descriptions on the back of an book are more interesting than what's actually inside."
3,good source,"when the subject is a history, the ocidental culture should learn with this book of how much we own to the oriental culture. it is odd to know that the Persian comes from the same indo-european origins of Greeks and Romans. it is odd to know that all we know about geometry, astronomy, mathematics and finances were developed by Persians. the only flaw, if I can say, is that the author writes too much details about the buildings and too few to writes about events and persons who rise and fall the persian empire."
2,A good start but not the final word,"I began this book knowing nothing about Persia aside from the brief mention everyone gets in Western Civ. I now know next to nothing. In all fairness, it is not the author's fault entirely. The book is well-written, but spans so great a period of time - rather important cultural beginnings and whatnot - that no one incident, subject or aspect of Persian culture and society is truly adequately treated. I would suggest this as the start for someone who thinks he might have an interest to pinpoint areas for further study. But, check it out of the library."
5,Tried and True,"Solid recipes without someone's rediculous ""interpretation"" of what a traditional dish should or could be. Great basic cooking techniques for the novice, some more daring for the experienced.I own 100's of cookbooks and cooking magazines - mexican, italian, asian - you name it. This one never fails, and I always go back to it."
3,Not for the amateur,"I really couldn't read this entire book. Actually, it borred the isht out of me early on and I put it down. This book is much more geared toward the 'semi-pro' fish breeders or marine biologists. This isn't for the casual reef keeper who just wants to have a pair of clownfish in the display that breed and then raise the spawn in a seperate smaller tank. Really way too technical of a read for casual hobbiests. Its 3 stars b/c I didn't read all of it and can't comment on the quality of the information provided (neutral review) - this book just isn't for the hobby market."
3,A Decent Live Album,"Do yourself a favor and skip right over the first six tracks: they're mindless remixes that crap all over these classic tunes by destroying the very rhythm that's central to their charm. Luckily, the other 14 tracks are decent live recordings that Bow Wow Wow fans will probably want to have in their collection. The sound quality isn't perfect, but it's better than on many live recordings you might find at a similar price. And, though most of the tracks add little to the original studio versions, they are at least competent."
5,Virtuoso at home in the works of Brahms,"Earl Wild brings sensitivity, lyricism, and virtuostic fire to his interpretations of this set of Brahms piano pieces. While others capture either the virtuosity or the intellectual demands (Katchen, Kovacevich, Lupu, Cliburn) Wild seems unique in the way he combines both. The accomplishment is all the more amazing considering the piano's age (nearly 90 for all of these but a set of variations from the 1980s). I own several Wild CDs but this is my favorite. As much as I love his transcriptions, he really seems to make these pieces SING."
5,Loved It!,"All four of these novels are wonderful. It was a nice surprise to see that the characters from the first book were incorporated into the second one.The first two stories are suspenseful and mysterious, which makes it difficult to put down the book.This is the perfect book to read if you want to enjoy the medieval time period; the land of maidens, knights, and castles. Even though each book is somewhat short (little over 100 pages each) it didn't seem to affect the story. This is a great read for vacations or at the beach, or if you have a few afternoons free."
3,It is okay.,"Tracie Peterson will never be my favorite author.While I was reading these books I felt like I was reading short stories. I did like some of the characters, but I did not especially like Mrs. Peterson's writing style. I am seventeen and read many different styles. Even though I love Christian books I would prefer to read non-christian books like Rosemary Sutcliff's, or the Count of Monte Cristo over this."
