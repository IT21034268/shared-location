5,Very Entertaining,Mr Chriss did an excellent job developing his characters and taking them on adventurous ride thru Washington.
5,The New Rosary in Scripture,Outstanding!!! He reveals facts of the Jewish background that makes the understanding of the mysteries of Jesus in the rosary alive...more meaningful...more vivid.
5,A book to keep handy when meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary,This is going to have a lot of use as I have found it excellent to refer to and keep me on track while meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary. I thoroughly recommend it to those seasoned or new to the Rosary.
3,Great Look,The Disc has a really great look. The weight is really a good aspect as well...however the way the wires are set up that light up the disc...they break where they connect to the lights. Otherwise great product
4,Damn good,Hollow Tip is a very unique rapper. You won't find this kind of music too many places. I know when I bump it everyone's heads turn. the new Flawless album is alright also. Takin no shortz seems to be a little better though.
4,"Merry Christmas, everybody, and a Happy New Year!","This Christmas album by Hall of Famer Bobby Darin was released in 1960. Bobby eschewed contemporary Christmas songs in favor of traditional hymms and Negro spirituals. No songs about Santa here, only songs about the birth of Jesus. Bobby sings them very well, with help from the Bobby Scott Chorale. The CD includes one bonus track, ""Christmas Auld Lang Syne"", which was released as a single the same year the album came out. It probably wasn't included on the album because it isn't about the birth of Jesus. This is a very good Christmas album."
3,Good movie,"I would have wanted to rent it rather to buy it. Once seen, I would not repeat a viewing. it was ok."
4,Very helpful,"I pray this rosary every day! The author invented his own mysteries (salvation, healing, Eucharistic, and consoling), joining them to the three classic mysteries (joyful, sorrowful and glorious), then put in scriptural verses to go with each Hail Mary. Now you can pray a different set of mysteries every day of the week. My only complaint is the binding of the book: after repeated use the pages fall out of the book."
3,not the best,"If you would like to buy any Jonathan record, this would be number 10 to buy. Go out and listen, there is much better stuff, including the latest one (""High Heels""), ""I, Jonathan"", ""You must ask the heart"" and all the albums from the 70's (the Beserkley-years). So Go Jo JO."
2,Making of RoboCop,"This vid-documentary is ok, it should have more to it(ie. how Murphy was killed,the ""melting man"" (when Emil was slowly disintergrating before our eyes),more intervews,it should have included the composer & how the score was done.The video does look kind of weak( it looks like someone had taped it from a cable channel& the sound is weak-it should digitized.)"
2,"Good, but not worth the price","I've had this tool set for just over a year now. I've been a Makita fan for years when I was a contractor, bought this set for personal use. The tools are nice, solid, do what they're supposed to, but, I haven't been real impressed with how long the batteries last. 3 year warranty on tools, but 1 year on batteries and CHARGER. Well, the charger just went TU and Makita won't cover it. Great.My advice for what it's worth. Go to Home Depot and buy a set of Ridgid cordless tools....they're way less expensive and come with a LIFETIME WARRANTY including batteries and charger. Contractor friend just bought a set and says they're as good as any he's ever used. 'Nuff said."
3,It's OK,Well I bought this game because my husband and I decided to have a few couples over once a week to hang out and play games. Honestly this game wasn't all that great I think it sould be updated.
1,All fluff and no substance,"Absolute basics, and wrongheaded at that. Ignores the impact of extraneous events that can hammer a stock during the short holding period associated with dividend capture, and which can turn incremental gains into disastrous losses. And if you are going to use technical analysis, which involves substantial risk, why not go for 20%, 40% or 100% gains?I will also note that someone frequently spams the Yahoo message boards promoting this book. Just an observation.bear9"
1,Save your money.,"If this book would have had some substance, it may have been worth reading. The author may very well know about capturing dividends, unfortunately she is not letting her readers know much about the subject. The title is kind of ironic. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,I've make a lot of money,"I bought this book last November. It took me about a week to really get the system set up and working. I have captured 53 dividends since I started. Not too many at first but more every month. I'm retired and have plenty of time to devote to capturing dividends, but if you have a desk job and a nice boss, you could do this at work. The book tells you everything you need to know to do this system and there are examples. Some parts are confusing at first, but if you reread them and think about it, you will understand. I can't believe that I am making all this money. It is the most fun I've had in a long time."
1,spammer,"someone is spamming here.. all the reviewers with 4 or more stars only have this review under their name..fishy indeed, I think the author or some friend are making fake reviews to boost sales..Imagine getting financial advise from a person of that kind of integrity ..LOL"
3,Oh My!,I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! My coworkers thought I was nuts when I laughed so hard I cried while reading over my lunch break.
2,Be Particular!,"Before I explain why I only gave the book 2 stars - let me say that I am a Wannabe Wannabe having marched in the 1st Million Queen March - and I enthusiastically anticipated the follow-up book. What a disappointment!I felt the book was only an enticement for those that have not read the first book to go and read it. There were far too many references to the first book - too many for someone that has read the first - but not enough for someone who has not. The first book was sassy and cute with just a little bit of crude thrown in - this one just a little too crude for this Wannabe.Advice from Jill Conner Browne herself - ""Be particular"" Read the first one over again instead of buying this one."
1,Nothing new in here,"If your over forty there's nothing here that you haven't heard already. It's not for the middle age beginner, there's no lesson tips other then way to much material on side saddle putting, and not enough on his swing. It's almost a guide on how to develop the yips! The drawings are mostly page filler."
3,Not Her Best Effort,"The synopsis of this book sounds so great but the story differs from it too much. The characters are interesting, but there is no romance in this novel. I typically expect more of a love story from Jude Deveraux. Also, I expected more of a ghost story not a tale about the devil. I really wouldn't reccommend this book to Jude Deveraux's normal readers."
2,terrible end,"First I thought, I might give this book a try since it was half the price and although I quite liked the b√©ginning and the author shows that she can touch your heart, the end was so very disappointing I still feel quite annoyed about how you could possibly find such a far-fetched outcome to the otherwise o.k. plot. What a shame!"
4,Different story from the usual formula,"It certainly wasn't what I was expecting, but I mean that in a good way. The story is told, in alternating chapters, from the viewpoints of Ford and Jackie. Romance is only hinted at in this book, because the thrust of the story is built on suspense. I'm still surprised that this was written by Jude Deveraux. I expected a ghost writer (no pun intended) because it is so different from her usual prose."
3,No network play function but can play without CD in your computer.,Old version Scrabble 2 requires CD in the computer but has a LAN or WLAN multi-player mode. But this one does not support LAN or WLAN multi-player mode.
1,CD Required...How silly,The game is fine but it will not last very long on my laptop as a CD is required to play the game. This is simply ridiculous. I would not have bought the game if I had known and advise anyone else not to as well.
3,Oddly primitive,"I bought this as a gift for my wife who loves Scrabble and has often played the older Scrabble Complete. This newer version of the game has an oddly primitive feel to it and lacks some of the nice customizability of the older one. It is a smooth and very stable version unlike its predecessor so it gets 3 stars as a compromise. She prefers it to the Scrabble 2007 Interactive game which I also got her despite my personal impression that the 2007 Scrabble looks more polished. The AI is as tough as any of the versions when set appropriately and this game would be useful for a wide range of people, but still retains that odd, primitive, ""childlike"" feel."
4,"Thorough, Reformed Doctrine of the Holy Spirit","Dr. Sinclair Ferguson's book on the Holy Spirit is a welcomed edition to any believers library. Ferguson is one of the best theologians in the Western hemisphere and his writings are brillant and full of Scripture.In this work, Dr. Ferguson delves into the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Yet in this short work (288 pages), he covers nearly every work of the Spirit from His divinity to the gifts of the Spirit.The book comes from a Reformed position so those from say a charismatic perspective may not like Ferguson's views on the baptism in the Spirit or the manifestation gifts of tongues and prophecy.Overall, a great book."
2,"If you are true to Attachment Parenting ideals, this might not be for you","I read (and unfortunately bought) this book ... and it does say you should not let your child sleep in your bed. It may not say you have to wean by 12 months, but it does suggest you look for weaning signs at that time ... AND THEN a paragraph or two later mentions that if you decide to breastfeed beyond this point you will have critics ... AND that some people breastfeed up to 6 or 8 years old. She is clearly driving people away from extended breastfeeding, probably inadvertantly, but still doing it with her presentation of the issue. Read this section yourself and see what I mean. IMHO, specifically on breastfeeding and cosleeping, the author is VERY anti-attachment parenting."
1,Not the best book I've read,"The tone of this book is rather condescending and opinionated. The authors assume that the reader is not too bright. For a more wholesome approach to parenting, read The Baby Book or The Discipline Book By Dr. William Sears."
4,Hmmm...good price,It's a great price...but not super user friendly...you have to know what you want to put in the blanks...nothing walks you through it...it is just forms for you to fill out.
4,Trees & Shrubs of Washington is a good book of Info,"Impressively illustrated with glorious full color photographs of the many trees and shrubs of Washington, serene woodlands carpeted with lush plants, this is the one to read and study. If you know of anyone with trees and shrubs on their minds, this is a unique book for identifing Washington trees and shrubs. I give it four starts only because it could use more pictures to help in the identification of trees and shrubs. It is one of the easiest books to use. Very well done!"
4,Well crafted piece of equipment,I found this capo to be well crafted and reliable. I use it on both my Bluegrass and Tenor banjos and it works well on both.
2,Not Enough Pressure For A Mandolin,"Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin, it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret, as it doesn't have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position.I have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style, but in this case it doesn't work for what I need."
5,Gorgeous needlepoint,"This is a beautiful needlepoint kit. The cotton floss colors are magnificent, even brighter and bolder than in the photo. This is a nice, small kit which you can finish in one day, which is always a plus. Highly recommended!"
4,Poignant and touching,"Poignant, and touching. Bao Ninh shows you not just the sorrow, but also the horror, of war. The horror lies not just in the bloody depictions of his war experience, but also in the realisation of the cruelty and thoughtless violence man can descend into. An extremely difficult read for me personally."
3,A good depiction of the North's view of the war,"In whole, I believe that this book gives a very vivid description of a Northern Vietnamese soldier's encounter with the war; however, I found the book to be somewhat confusing in the way it goes back in forth between past and present. The author's use of flashbacks in the novel make it more difficult for one to grasp the story than if it was written chronologically."
1,Unreadable!,"I am not a Vietnam expert but I have a pretty good background in it. I have read a lot of fiction and non-fiction dealing with the war and I was quite intrigued by this book. A well reviewed biographical novel from the NVA side of the war seemed like a must read.Twice I have read good reviews for this book and twice I have tried to read it and twice I have found it unreadable.Maybe its just the translation, but I just could not get into this book. I found it almost a ramble and just too much of a stream of conciousness.I see here there are many positive reviews for the book. But I must say again two times I have tried to read it and two times I found it unreadable.Maybe the third times the charm?"
4,I love this book,"Sure the book could have been better done, but no matter. Each section captures the spirit and age in which it was written. The photos are rather good, and there are a fine number of them. For anyone who surfs, or looks at surfing as more than just a sport, this is a book to thumb through."
4,"Great songs, but quite old.","I love the band, I love the songs, the style, the lyrics, and the rhythm. Gets to ya after a while though."
4,Decent cable,"It's a good cable, nothing really all that special about it. My brother uses it when he practices bass, so it gets the job done."
5,you will fall in love with this movie,"I can't say enough about this movie. Someone passed it along to me and I cried and even laughed. This movie grabes at the heart and you can't help but think of your own Grandmother. I have a better appreciation for the simple things in life. This is a simple movie but it leaves you thinking about it long after you have watched it. Once you see this film you will want to tell everyone you know to watch it. There's nothing like it, a true gem."
5,More Profound Than a Mere Morality Tale,"I was inspired by this beautifully made film. The message is awesome. Its all about the true nature of love, unselfishness, family, humility, etc.More profound than a mere morality tale, its more equivalent to a beautiful work of art, showcasing the greatness of a simple human heart."
5,Love this movie,"i remember when i first saw this movie, it was touching. its a point of view young adults,teens, and children dont see or dont want to see. this movie helped me respect my parents and grandparents more, not that i was completely disrespectful throughout life, but it made me look at a lot of stupid things ive done in life that disappointed many people besides family. and if you like tear jerkers this movie is a good one, it has its comedies in it. its a great movie you defintely gotta buy it."
1,Useless,"This book was written, like many of this kind are, for people who are already in a position to undertake these kinds of things. It is of no value to me whatsoever. I recommend it to the users and the climbers who have the ability to walk over everyone on their way to the top."
2,TMZ dropped into a drivel pool,"A series of bizarre advice about random things to falsely portray yourself.Example: How To Appear to be Well Read. Really? Who cares? Try reading a f#$#$%ing book.Also provides some underhanded ways to make it by: collecting welfare/pension while on vacation etc.None of the book is supported by scientific evidence, studies or anything remotely tangible.You will, however, find a few anecdotes about people who don't want to work and appear to be well read who manage to crash parties with ""C-list celebrities."" Sounds exciting, huh?"
1,Sleazy,"My objection to GETTING AWAY WITH IT probably has a lot to do with my very straight forward personality. I don't like trying to ""put something over"" on others any more than I appreciate someone trying to fool me. Other people reading the book may see it as a big game and I guess that's okay for them."
3,Not quite up to par,The characters lacked depth and generally the story was more about food and construction than love. I should have taped Home Improvement and saved my $10. She has never disappointed me in the past. I suppose my expactations for Kallmaker are a little to high.
1,A new Guru?,"Of course one can see where he is coming from.The toltec tradition is very popular , but keep an open mind on these teachings . I have met those who wax lyrical about Theun and in the same breath down play ever other toltec writer as if theun shoud be seen as later day toltec guru and anyone who didn't think so was either simple minded or just plain straight out didn't get the message of the books . That is way too dogmatic to be credible. Alot of repetition and retstatement of the same views.The lenght of a book and the densisty of a book is no indication of its quality . The question is it practical and is it respectful of others ,or does it play the game of the specials over here and the not so specials over there . A useful read , but by no means the definitive work that theun tries to tell the reader it is. Also though he makes claims at great lenght about his connection to to castenedas teacher , the details are some what shrouded in mist."
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to get this soundtrack becuase I love the music in the movie. That said, I must say, that when I began to listen to the c.d. I thought something was wrong with it. Who ever thought it cool to add that sound, of a running car in the background was way off base - it sounds awful(and left me feeling ripped off). Also, the production is just plain poor. The poetry reading, the bits from the movie, all have a tape recorded quality. And again, with that annoying running car sound, the soundtrack often sounds like we are listening to someone listening to the soundtrack while driving in a car and that, in turn, was recorded on a tape recorder. What gives?!! Neil's music stands on it's own and some bonehead loused it up! You'll have to work hard to get past all that crappy production to appreciate the haunting, awesome atmosphere of one of Neil's most artistic forays. I wouldn't buy it if I were you. You'd do better to record it straight off of the dvd, it would be less irritating."
1,Are there two releases of this?,"My disc has the engine noise LOUD! It is so loud and noticable that I cannot escape the notion that the people who gave this CD a favorable review did not have the same CD!And it's not just the engine noise, which at times is louder than the other content... there is absolutely room noise and other mechanical noise that means this is an ambient recording of the actual tracks! There is hiss... not tape hiss... BAD, CHEAP MIC hiss!I'm going to hook my DVD player up to my decent recording setup and make my own soundtrack. I'm not putting down Neil Young's work on this film. That was inspired and beautiful. The CD I have is just more bad recording noise than it is music.And yes, I have the full CD product, not a copy."
1,dreadful man,"i own all neil young CD's in print, LP's and a half dozen bootlegs. every artist is entitled to make an occasional mistake. i've compared ""dead man"" to everything else neil young has done, and there is no doubt it is mistitled. it should be titled ""dreadful man"". i'll take re-ac-tor and hawks and doves any day, even american star's n' bars."
2,Dead Man movie soundtrack by Neil Young,"Mr. Young has added background noise that was not in the original Movie. These noises aresomewhat atuned to the Grounge movement of the Washington State area, Seattle and such.I do not like this sound mix."
2,didn't like it,"just not what i expected. o'well, its the chance ya take on some things. i would not recomend it to any one."
2,I should've read these reviews before buying,"A frustrating and disappointing edition of what should've been a great soundtrack. There's some great guitar-playing here, I admit, but the main theme (as featured in the film) is missing, the automotive sound effects are a weird and irrelevant toss-in, and one poem would've been plenty. The biggest drag is that I bought this CD for one song, and for whatever reason ""they"" didn't see fit to include it."
2,Malfunctioned and overheated. Good customer service.,"Very hard to install. Operates with horizontal mount, but not with vertical. Overheated and took too long to stop spinning. My friend has Acer CD-Rom with the same problems. Customer service was good but best they could recommend was to return the product. Would give 0 rating if not good customer support."
4,"Richly colored music, with pungent, smokey flavors.","This album duplicates my first encounters with International Music. In the 1960's, I traveled up and down the radio dial, listening to the language and music of different ethnic communities located in Chicago. It was thrilling! In this album, we hear the exotic music ""broadcast"" by the mysterious ""Radio Tarifa."" The music blends modes from the European and the African shores of the Mediterranean. The music has a haunting, plaintive quality that grabbed hold of me. I look forward to purchasing their other album in the future.Note: The theme of thrilling music coming in on radio waves from distant lands is also captured in the song ""Telefunken"" (?) on the album ""Enlightenment"" by Van Morrison."
5,Wow this study is awesome,This is the most amazing study and will get you closer to God. We have been all sharing and getting closer together also. It is great for personal revival. I have had experience with Life Action Ministries in a real life revival and it changed my life. Do it! God Bless.
3,Ok,Arrival took longer than i hoped was more writing in pen in bookThan i would have liked but was ok.
5,Best Foundational Study,"Nancy Leigh DeMoss et al did it again!This is the best foundational study and all leaders male or female should be required at leaststrongly suggested completing this study in order to serve the body of Christ.Great personal reflection questions that are HARD HITTING but in a good and necessary way.Don't miss out on growing closer to God with a heart that has been tenderized and certainlyplowed up and turned over for the seeds that God wants to replant in your heart for REVIVAL.Can't recommend it more highly and plan on leading it again in the fall.kfleming colorado springs, CO"
3,May be upsetting to sensitive readers,"I thought that this book was well-crafted, but I didn't enjoy it. The main character, Kamoj, is abused by one of her lovers - I won't say which. It seemed to me that she never escapes a victim mentality or truly learns to stand on her own two feet. For this reason, I found the book very upsetting.I do believe that the issue of abuse should be addressed in literature, but I don't think this is the way to do it. I didn't feel the book gave enough resolution to the issue it raised. I have to wonder why something like this would be given the Nebula. What does that say about our culture?"
5,Please give us back this book! You have no right !,"I am profoundly indebted to Mr. Woodrow for providing a serious study using reliable sources and thorough research into a religious system addressed in Revelation 17. Thank you sir for your courage to reveal the truth about this ""religious whore"" which will surely drink the blood of many believers and is beginning to exact punishment even now on those who worship the King of kings."
1,RCA Should Be Avoided,"My husband bought this as a surprise.It was the highest end at the storehe shopped at. I would not have purchasedanother RCA product as the prior two werereturned for being defective.This product has a fan that moans andgroans real loud for about five minutesuntil it warms up. Some of the featuresjust come and go. The first night it wasjust great - but give it a week. It was thesame way with the last two, they should lastlonger than a month!? But they don't. Neveragain I say."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This system is so bad, that just looking at it now puts me in a bad mood. The speakers are average, but the DVD player has the strangest balance. The system has scratched more DVDs than I can remember. If you feel like having a $200 dust collector that produces poor sound and destroys your stuff, then this is for you. I will never own anything by RCA again, nor will I wish this poor product on anyone."
2,Terrible Product Support,"This unit works fine about 70% of the time but has started not recognizing DVD's. I assumed the lens needed cleaning so I bought a Maxell DVD Lens Cleaner. It would not recognize the disk. It showed the message ""Bad Disk"". Finally, after turning the power on and off several times it recognized the disk. Cleaning the lens didn't seem to help. I e-mailed RCA customer support and received a reply to call customer support to discuss the problem. I called the toll free number and was connected to a customer support center in Manila. They were absolutely no help at all. Their only advice was to clean the lens. Please, save your money. Do not buy this unit. I will NEVER purchase anything made by RCA"
1,Amazon jipped me on this shipment!!!,"The item itself was fine. What was not fine was the fact that this case was to have 12 boxes in it and my box only had 10 - so I got jipped out of 2 boxes. Since Amazon won't take this item back - I am just stuck paying for 12 items when I only received 10. So, think twice before ordering this item from Amazon!!!"
5,Finally a Book with the AIDS given clearly,Finally! A book on in hand training and how to take the movements from the ground to mounted training. And a real explanation of each step for teaching the Spanish Walk (among many other movements) to a green horse. This is a book we'll return to again and again.
5,Moving Mountains,I meet this young lady when she was first coming out with this CD. She autographed it for me and then later we went to private concert that we had won tickets to. She has an awesome voice and is a very nice person to meet. Water to the soul is an excellent edition to any collection. I just found she sings country now and I'm buying those Cd's also.Thanks for the great music and hope to meet you again one day!God Bless Our Troops!
1,Bad Buy!,"This is a bad buy! The Kenny Ball disc is missing 3 of the songs listed in the track listing, the listing is misnumbered and the last 3 songs listed are played in a medley....they are not complete songs at all. I found it to be a very big disappointment."
4,Let's FREAK Again !,"Here it is: The second and strangely final season of Steven Speilberg's ""Freakazoid"" is now on DVD !From Geek to Freak, Dexter Douglas is having some stranger adventures. Especially when he starts to ""FREAK OUT"" and transform into the craziest hero you'd might set your sights low on: Freakazoid ! Witness 11 insane episodes on 2 discs like Dexter's first date, Freakazoid versus an evil Freakazoid clone, and even the origin episode of the freakishness that started it all. Sadly, since it's the last of the series, it's more than enough to satiate one's sanity in this cartoon.And to spice things up, there's some nifty special features like a retrospective or two by the creators and cast of the show on the final episode as does this whole season. Plus, there's a never-before-heard demo tape by music man Richard Stone (known for some of his award-winning work on Animaniacs).With two complete seasons of sincere super-powered silliness, this collection can really get off the wall !"
4,It was a pleasure...,"Well first off i would like to say this novel was defenantly a shock to me. I wasn't too accustomed to Channer's writing. I previously read one of his novellas in ""Got to Be Real,"" and was impressed. After reading ""Satisfy my Soul,"" i truly came to realize how gifed this young black author truly is. One of the biggest things that suprised me...was the fact that this wasn't the common ""romance novel."" At times i question if it was truly made to be a romantic story. To me it seemed to be a plot of a man discovering himself, finding his self identity possibly through meeting his supposed ""soul-mate."" But his journey was truly interesting and thought provoking. Beyond the self discovery and love there was also underlining themes of friendship, loyalty, belonging, history, family, and most importantly religion. I truly did enjoy this novel and recommend everyone to experience the distinct flavor Colin Channer has to offer to the literary society."
1,A TRUE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I don't know what Colin Channer was writing about in this book. It appears he might have lost a true love & is still sulking. Come on, Colin...MOVE ON...I LOVED WAITING IN VAIN...I was looking forward to another masterpiece. Sorry..this one didn't make it in my eyes."
4,SO YOU WANT SOME ROMANCE?,"HOW ABOUT ROMANCE, AFRICAN HISTORY AND SPIRITUALITY TO TOP IT ALL OFF. SATISFY MY SOUL DIVES INTO ALL THESE THEMES AND COMES OUT WITH A READ THAT WILL TAKE THE READER TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING LOVE AND SPIRIT. AS CHANNER COVERS THESE THEMES, HE SOAKS THE READER IN WORDS OF A PSYCHO-SEXUAL NATURE THAT IS NOT ONLY WHAT WE WANT, BUT MORE IMPORTANT, WHAT WE NEED. I WAS SO SWEPT AWAY BY FRANCES AND CAREY'S JOURNEY. IT IS A CHALLENGING AND VERY FASCINATING READ.......LOVE YOU, CHANNER!"
4,Highly recommended,"I have been amazed by those tree comments above. As a proud Iranian-Azeri I found this book very enlightening about a history that because of some political reasons is steal under shadow. I think that Mr. Atabaki intension in his book is to mention some historical fact rather then an attempt for separation of Azerbaijan from its mother-land, Iran. My personal impression from whole book was that, at the same time that Mr. Atabaki tried to write an academically type book but some times in the book he was hunted by his feelings about Iran specially when he talks about ""nave Nakhjavanin request for union with Iran from Russia."
3,"Expected more ""VISUAL"" in this book...","Name is misleading...it was all print and very little pictures. I was expecting a ""LIFE"" magazine type of paperback book. It was printed on the cheapest grade of paper and looked ""aged""...definitely overpriced."
1,Eh,I was really excited to read this book but I didn't enjoy it. It reads like a textbook to me. My mind drifted. Even the part about Disneyland couldn't hold my attention. Overall I found it really dry and not a fun read.
5,Pantera Bring Out Another Classic,"Oh my God. This is one of the best albums I own. I like every song on this. Dimebag Darrels best work is on here. This album includes my favourite Pantera aong of all time Becoming (Next to Cemetery Gates) 5 Minutes Alone you might have heard already. Vinnie Paul is such a good Drummer. I'm Broken is one of Panteras best songs. And Shedding Skin is great too. Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills...check out the lyrics to this one! Planet Caravan is a Black Sabbath cover, and I think Phil has a better voice than Ozzy, so Panteras cover is better than the origional. Strength Beyong Strength is one of their heaviest songs of all time. At the moment Phil Anselmo is in another band called Superjoint Ritual. They're one of my favourite bands too. Pretty much anything Phil touches turns to gold. If you're a real heavy metal fan, you'd already have this CD."
3,I don't know???,"Hmmmm. I have such mixed emotions about this band and this album in particular. I think musically this album is great. It has driving guitars and powerful rhythms that are great for running around to. However, I have problems with this band lyrically. While Phil Anselmo attempts to get some important social issues across, he does so in such crude fashion it is hard to take him seriously. Maybe if they thought out their lyrics a bit better, people would acquiesce and say, ""Okay. This is a good metal band. I think they could have been a little more intelligent."
1,why?,"....I thought they were struggling on vulger but damn they shoulda stopped why they were ahead, doesnt even sound like metal to me... just some dweeb screaming trying to look cool. If u like good music dont buy this."
1,Remember battle of the bands in high school?,"This is not very intelligent music. Maybe if you are a teenager or a slow, or immature adult, you could get into this band, but otherwise I would recommend staying away. By the way, the lyrics are among the worst I have ever seen! I would advise Pantera to not included them next time. If lyrics, songwriting, and musicianship are not important to you then here is a band for you, but otherwise do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,Terrible pressing,"I received this vinyl today and could not wait to play it. My enthusiasm came to a grinding halt when I hit side 4. The sound became shrill and the surface noise was unbelievable for a limited edition 3000 count vinyl. It was like I had a totally different record. You think the quality control would be manageable for such limited quantities. Forget it! I have read on the internet about Cowboy's having some skipping issues on side 3 and I can tell you 1st hand that Vulgar is full of non-fill discoloration. Although that title seems to play decently. Avoid these Record Shop Day reissues at all cost. They are going to do them all over again anyway as anniversary editions and a defective pressing of 3 titles would give one cause to buy them all again, but I wont be giving the Rhino hogs any more cash."
4,Good for its price,"The only complaint is that when I tried to use a better headphone, there was considerable hiss. Otherwise pretty good."
2,Beautiful but WAY too delicate,"I received these glasses and both were craked during shipping. They were well packed, but just WAY too delicate. I'm sure that during use they would have cracked on their own. . . . you're better off to order the plastic ones."
1,"These glasses are delicate and break easily, even when just putting in ice cubes...","No warranty on these glasses and they break upon putting ice cubes in them...not functional....too bad, cuz' they cost a lot of money...if they don't break, they are great glasses...if anyone has warranty info. please let me know."
4,no sweat double-wall glasses by bodum,"Worth every penny. Great size, blown glass, no sweat. Only complaint is that they're fragile. I bought the smaller size in December and found out how fragile, by busting 2 within 2 days. One just by sticking my hand in to vigorously wash it. I don't do that anymore."
1,STOP! Don't even think about it!,"Don't even think about ordering from Warehouse Deals! Currently, 02/06/2012 I have had two separate orders for these good glasses, but neither order contained the glass that Amazon is showing. You don't get the double-wall Bodum. TWICE now this company has sent a great looking, correct box, . . . but inside is a completely different single-wall glass. Amazon should NOT let this kind of merchant continue to send alternate merchandise without informing consumers that there is a swap. Great Box! Wrong glass!"
3,Broken hearted,"Really liked these glasses, problem is getting them. They keep arriving broken, Amazon says dont worry about sending back broken ones, then one month later say there going to charge me for them for not be returned, What a pain this was. I really like amazon, but no more glass products will be purchased there!!!"
1,Shattered Dreams,"They were more than I'd usually pay for glasses, but I figured heck, I had just gotten payed might as well get something nice. A few hours after purchasing I noticed all these negative reviews about them being fragile, and thought to my self ""oh noes"". A few days later mine arrived, and were in fact in a million little pieces in the box. I contacted the seller and he told me they were insured, so I took them to the post office, and they gave me a form, which I'm about 90% certain the *sender* was supposed to get. Overall, these glasses have just been a disappointment. Adding insult to injury, I was at Target yesterday, and right on the rack they had the set, for less than I payed, non broken. I suggest avoiding mail order with these!"
3,"Good, but McDaniel is the best MFU writer","British writer Peter Leslie was probably the most prolific writer of ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" novels next to the late, great David McDaniel. He favored a dry, somewhat humorless style of writing which didn't really bring out the tongue-in-cheek approach that underlay so much of the series' charm (though there were moments).""The Splintered Sunglasses Affair"" is a typical Leslie MFU outing. In this novel, Napoleon Solo is kidnapped from the famous fitting room in Del Floria's tailor shop literally under the eyes of U.N.C.L.E. itself, and spirited off to Italy where he is (politely) grilled by a senior Thrush official and his lovely companion. At the same time, an U.N.C.L.E. agent is murdered over critical information on holograms and Illya Kuryakin (and Solo, once he gets away from his captors) must track down the ""splintered sunglasses"" of the title.Well-written and fast-paced, but as I said in my title, David McDaniel is the best U.N.C.L.E. writer."
5,It does the job,It's black and holds eyeglasses on a chain around the neck. It is very easy to install- just slip it on.
4,Lots of information,"This book has a lot of useful information and I believe will be helpful, have learned quite a bit already."
2,Would have been a great book if one chapter was not missing!,"One chapter was completely missing from the copy that I purchased from Elliot's in Sacramento, CA. I felt that the book concentrated too much on RA, and not enough on OA. I suffer from OA, and the book did not offer me any hope at all. Please send another copy since quite a bit of mine was missing."
5,Gout is a form of Arthritis too!!,"This book is amazing. I followed the plan and my Gout, the constant pain in my legs and tendonitus all went away within a month. I highly recommend this book no matter what form of Arthritus you have. JUST DO IT! It will not only change your life but give you your life back."
5,one of the best albums of the 90's period,"When this album came out in the fall of 91 i couldn't believe it sank without a trace, but it did. after releasing ""chain"" which sold well on black radio, this talented trio bought all the chips to table an amazing fusion of hard rock, funk, soul, hip-hop ballads and lyrics that make you think and songs that shake your booty .black radio ran like the punks they are opting to play no-talents like jodeci and mary j. bilge(no wonder black radio still sucks for not playing a more diverse musical pallet) they are and rock radio was even worse in the era of nirvana it seemed like they wanted praticed the highlander theory ""there can only one"" black rock band it that was living colour.in an era where gangsta rap was starting to take off this was a musical breath of fresh air where real people played insturments , snag and emoted."
5,The Best Trumpet,"I have dozens of albums in my car, but Moment to Moment finds its way to my cd player more often than any other album. The quality of Hargrove's trumpet is the best one could ask for. The musical choices are perfect for producing a contemplative mood. I could never part with this work. Every piece is a treasure."
3,Good phone for the price.,"The Uniden EXP 7901 has the basics you want in a cordless phone such as clear reception and a long battery life, but it is nothing special. The best 'extra' features are the three ring choices and volume control, the handset locator and the low battery warning. The major drawbacks of this phone are an echo of your voice when talking, the weight of the handset (fatigue becomes a factor over long calls) and the ring volume doesn't go loud enough to be heard if there is a lot of background noise such as TV or stereo. The Uniden EXP 7901 is good to have as a spare, but I don't recommend it as your primary phone."
3,Uniden EXP 7901,"This cordless phone allows conversations to be heard extremely clear. There is no static heard even when using the flash button to answer call-waiting.However, the ""flash"" and ""talk"" button features are inconvenient; when the phone is held to your ear using the side of your face and your shoulder to hold it to your ear, the ""flash"" button can easily disconnect your party. In addition to that, if you move your face slightly, then the ""talk"" button will also disconnect your party.Whenever the handset is lifted from the cradle while the phone is ringing, then you have answered the phone without pressing a button. This feature can be a nuisance at times.This phone does not have a button to turn the ringer off. The volume of the handset can only be adjusted slightly. If your caller talks loud, then there is no way to keep this person from shouting in your ear.Overall, this phone offers clarity and that is it. It lacks several other important features."
1,Don't be fooled,"The record you receive is not the one described on the site - it's only the 13-track version, not the fifteen."
4,Excellent reference guide,Very informative and thought provoking. a must have for specialists in the field! you wont be wasting your money
3,Another fine score from Stephen Flaherty,"Stephen Flaherty, composer of ""Ragtime"" and ""A Man of No Importance,"" and director Frank Galati have fashioned this musical curio based on the words of Gertrude Stein.Anyone familiar with the works of Stein, knows that she is an acquired taste. This work proves no exception to that rule. The story follows the relationship of Gertrude and Alice from courtship to grave. Flaherty's score is both varied and accomplished. the singing players perform admirably, raising their voices in splendid harmonies; and though the gorgeous melodies and orchestrations struggle under the weight of Stein's monotonous, often nonsensical word play, I found the effect wonderfully strange and hypnotic.This is adventerous, challenging material that I wouldn't recommend for the tired businessman. ""Loving Repeating"" is something special for Stein enthusiasts and die-hard musical theatre lovers."
4,FatMax laser,These work well for vertical. We have purchased them before from box stores but the price was much better here.Had them in a couple days.
4,"Great Instrumentals, Vocalist Needs Work","At first, I found the lead singer of this band, Selene Vigil, to be increadably annoying. Her lack of melody greatly perturbed me. Perhaps this wouldn't have been so obnoxious if the instrumentalists weren't so damn good. The rhythm section as well as the guitarists are solid and innovative. After a while of listening to this album, the vocals became bearable, and sometimes invigorating. 7 Year Bitch is a step up from punk: they posess the rage but also include technical maturity and knowledge."
4,It is one of the best.. but,It was a little bit bigger than my wife's face.. but it would be amazing if you use it with big faces..one bad thing about these masks is that they don't have sizes
1,Disappointing,Highly disappointed with this mask. The feathers appear to be hurriedly placed and are falling off. Glue can be seen at different places on the mask. The headband does not help the mask to stay on properly. It was also too big for my face. Not worth the money.
2,it was okay,My head was to big for the mask. also the feather and beads kept falling off. besides that it was a nice design
1,Utter rubbish,"This is a collection of perhaps the worst ever music heard on the tv series Doctor Who. Why it was ever released in the first place is a mystery itself - as for why it was re-issued, who knows. There are a few redeeming tracks from Dominic Glynn, but practically all of Keff McCulloch's work here is pure elevator music. Not an album to play to impress a prospective romantic partner..."
3,worth the money,"The video is decent and worth the money. Nothing flashy or crappy. I would have liked more info on the makiwara (i.e. constructing one, especially the striking post with the tire in the background of the video). Good info."
1,This should be illegal!,"Wow! Paul must have loved Linda dearly to not pull the plug on this and put his namesake on it. I`d stick Linda`s lyrics on the family refrigerator along with Ringo`s. But please don`t let Linda or Ringo`s lyrics leave the safe, loving confines of the home. We`re embarrassed by such projects, but don`t let Linda and Ringo know!"
3,Interesting,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this album-but it's not bad--on some songs, particularly ""Cow"" and ""The White Coated Man""-Linda reminds me very much of Kate Bush both in style and substance. ""Mister Sandman"" and ""Sugartime"" are both fun versions of older songs-and ""Poison Ivy"" while not quite as good-is the same. ""The Light Comes from Within"" is probably the highlight of the album. All in all-a fun cd from an artist who wasn't appreciated in her lifetime."
3,"Good product, poor website","The hardware and software both seem to work pretty well and consistently, but the website where the workout info is downloaded and archived rarely works smoothly. For example, sometimes you can click on a tab to change the way the information is displayed and just a blank screen comes. Not infrequently when you go to the website from iTunes you still have to sign in again, but not always. Fortunately the workout history is also recorded on the Nano itself, but there's more detail on the website and you can see everything all at once on the website too, whereas on the iPod, it's just one workout at a time, as far as I can tell. Bottom line: good product and great idea, but there are plenty of kinks in the website. Fortunately, those kinds of things can always be improved in the future and hopefully Nike's people are trying to do that now."
3,Something you may not like about this product,"This product is generally well designed but one thing that prevents me from enjoying it is when I plug it in, the ipod become too long to hold in hand. The original ipod nano has just the right length to hold comfortably between my thumb and little finger. By holding ipod this way you worry less about it slip through your hand. However, when the NIKE+IPOD receiver is attached, it can no longer be held in this way, and you will need to buy an arm band etc.Another thing I don't like about this product is the NIKE+ website. It could have been so much more fun if they put functionality before how cool it looks. The website is entirely in flash, and it takes 100% CPU when you use it. A lot of time you won't be able to do what you want, for example look at other people's run profile (speed vs. time)"
2,Great for stalkers.,RFID chips in your shoes allow anyone to follow your every move. Hope no one is stalking you.
4,Just for your informstion.,"TRACKS INCLUDE: KICK IT DOWN, BED OF ROSES, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?, BAD NEWS, LET IT GO, RAGGED HEART, NO SAD GOODBYES, WHEN ANGELS CRY, BABY THE RAIN MUST FALL, RESCUE ME."
1,"unimaginative, crass, lowbrow","What a dreadful piece of dreck. this may be the REAL drew carey, but that's more than i want to know about anyone. while his tv fans are certain to sample the book. i suspect word of mouth will quickly kill this cretinous compilation."
4,The only time I put it down was to go to sleep at night.,I got this book as a christmas gift this year(Thanks Mom and Dad) I was very excited to get it because 1. Drew is one of my favorite TV shows and 2. Because even though it came out a long time ago I had been waiting until it came out in paperback to buy it and read it(I hardly ever buy books in hardcover unless its history because it costs too much. After all that waiting this book didn't disappoint. The only time I put it down was to go to sleep at night. It is by far the best star written book I've read.The only part of the book I didn't like were the short stories at the end. This is not to say I didn't like the stories. They just didn't belong in this book. Drew should write a book of just short stories. It would be great.
2,Save your money - the TV show's free and better,"The jokes are old, the text is depressing, and Mr Carey was painfully right when he said a ghost writer could have done a better job. Drew Carey spends a large part of the book's 237 pages ranting, raving, and occasionally whining about life. I'm not some blue-blooded snob, but I found his constant profanity to be gratuitous, unimaginative, and tiresome. It's like he's trying to make up for all the language the network censor never lets him put in the show. I LOVE the TV show, but I'm ashamed at myself for having read the entire book (I kept thinking to myself ""It HAS to get better!"" - it didn't). If you're going to read this book anyway, at least borrow it from the library so you don't feel stupid for wasting your time AND blowing $22.95"
3,"Grab a Beer, Sit Back, and Read on","Drew Carey's first writing combines some good, dirty humor (if you like that sort of thing) along with honest, straight forward views on life, politics, and television. He also takes a few shots at writing short storiesThe first part of the book deals primarily with humor and some of Carey's personal views on life. I felt that this was the best part of the book, full of great jokes and blunt, but fair criticism of politics, hollywood living, and other aspects of life in general. There was little coverage given to Carey's personal life history. I would have liked it if he had said a little more on this subject. Drew included a section of pictures that will surprise the reader. You won't believe that some of these pictures are really Drew Carey.At the end of the book is a section of short stories that Drew Carey wrote himself. These ""stories of the unrefined"" are ok, but I would have preferred to read more humor."
2,Very limited appeal,"This is a collection of dirty jokes, short fiction and autobiographical tidbits will please some readers and offend most others. Drew Carey, a stand-up comic and star of his own TV show, writes mostly about sex, drinking, gambling, football and television. Four-letter words dominate this book, giving the book a definite adolescent, male tone. Carey makes note that the more offensive his material, the more popular he became. He also includes a sample of the negative reviews and letters he has received. Overall, this book has a very limited appeal and I don't recommend it."
4,"It's not War and Peace but then again, it not supposed to be","Drew Carey is a funny guy. As his Funny Bone commercials state, ""funnier than you"". The first half of the book is extremely funny then loses its momentum for the latter half. Drew lets you in to his human side, where a lot of other celebrities would shy away from such thinks making Drew even more likable knowing who he is and where he came from. I think his show was great and I think he knows that the joke and his star are not always going to be popular so enjoy it while you can. Drew, the every man's everyman. This book is not a laugh riot but a nice look a man that found his way to stardom by accident without any aspirations from childhood. It does make you laugh but it is not a jokebook. Remember that. I enjoyed this quite a bit while at home and at the beach, a very good beach companion. Give it a try!"
4,Very suprised with his cohesive fiction!!,"I was very pleased with the final four chapters of Drew's book. His dark comedic approach to fiction reminded me of Steve King stories as told by Steve Martin. Drew Carey has, at least, a solid part time job writing about the humor involved in lethal revenge."
4,Drew Carey can write? Yes he can!,"This book is an interesting humor book. Part joke book, part biography, part short storeis. It's three short books combined into one. The first part is by the most hilarious. Just pure, uncensored hilarity. I got a great kick about how he made 101 jokes about how big one certain body part was.The second part is not the best part, but it sheds some light on who Drew Carey is, and what the show is all about. It's not the highlight of the book, but even Drew Carey grudgingly admits he didn't want to put it in but felt obliged to.The third part is suprisingly good. He writes about 4 short stories that, though not humorous, are interesting. It's classic blue collar literature. ""Tackling Jim Brown"" should by all means be considered a classic.Check out the book, and you can show why Drew Carey has a highly rated show and is a great stand up comic."
4,Great flag,"This is a great flag for the money. I wish it had a sleeve at the edge for a flag pole to slide through, but it just has two grommets for clips."
4,"Nice, but...","I would give it a 9 out of 10... The only drawback is that it does not provide a constant monitoring. You must press a button to get a new, up to date reading... not bad, but it does throw you off your stride."
4,"Good HRM, lousy band","I bought this watch over a Mio mainly because of price and because of the poor reviews the MIO's received on Amazon. NEVER had a problem getting a reading, but it is a challenge getting a stable reading while running (not to mention trying to avoid running into something or someone while you're looking down at the watch). I wore this watch as my everyday watch for almost a year until the band finally gave out. That's where I think MIO has an advantage, they know the band is going to give out, so they offer ""colorful"" replacement bands."
4,a good design,"Purchased this feeder at the end of season for birds. It seems a bit flimsy, but works well. No problem with ants when the moat is filled with water."
1,"broke after 3 months, no fix in sight","I purchased this sharpener about 3 months ago. It looks good but after sharpening 30 pencils over this short time the roter is broken. I went to the place of purchase and they were ""out"". Useless 2 year warantee."
4,Visually and conceptually compelling (with great soundtrack),"Psychedelic animated collage meets Postcolonial Studies in a compelling visual and musical commentary on Euro-American colonialism / imperialism, and the orientalist construct. Ken Adams has made an innovative step forward in awakening American popular culture to its long held stereotypes of the indigenous and Oriental ""Other."""
2,Okay...,"Not that amazing, just a rubber brush that worked better for dust on my tv screen than anything else. I honestly haven't used it but once or twice and wasn't really impressed with it removing cat hair"
5,Great tool,"This is a great to tool to complement anyone's tool chest. Although item arrived broken, there were no issues with even exchange/return. Simple to use, but need to read directions for mounting and use."
1,Doesn't Work,Put batteries in; 2 lines appeared and then disappeared forever. Product didn't work and I could get it to work. I returned it.
2,Putty leaves residue on drywall,"The level is designed to adhere to a wall with provided putty. But when you pull the level off a painted drywall wall, there remains remnants of the putty. Because it doesn't harden, it's nearly impossible to remove. Big fail."
4,Works Great! ...with a catch...,"This product works just as advertised. The laser is easy to align and makes it easy to hang stuff on the wall or whatever you need to work with. The only thing I would caution is that the sticky stuff used to hold it to the wall doesn't work. It will hold it there for about 20 seconds before this thing comes crashing down onto whatever is below it. Find a buddy/wife/child/robot to hold it up and you're good to go. For the price, it certainly can't be beat but the sticky stuff loses a star for this product. Other than that, it works great!"
3,Unusual Olga,"This is probably the oddest of Olga Tanon's albums. It is basically a pop album with a big layer of Spanish sensibilility layered on. Overall I find it a bit overstylized and over earnest, even hoaky, at times. It couldn't be more different than her previous album Llevame Contigo, or, for that matter, her following one, Yo Por Ti.The best songs are the three by Kike Santander: Tu Amor, Hielo y Fuego, and one real gem--Un Hombre y Una Mujer."
2,A cut-and-paste history,"The author, strangely for an expert, does not present a coherent vision of the history of the area. Little nuggets of information are strung along, as if he has cut-and-pasted this history together, without any real mastery of the subject. The pace is consequently choppy, as bits and pieces are seemingly added as they occur to him, without plan. The space allotted to each topic is equally random. It is possible that these problems have their roots in his straining to be seen as a revisionist historian, tidying up the history of Appalachia for the tastes and prejudices of 21st-century readers. The choppiness allows for suspicious omissions or digressions. This makes him appear to be an unreliable, uncertain source of information about the region. The editing makes the book seem even more unreliable. Quotations are not cited, and what sort of editor lets through the use of ""of course"" multiple times on a single page?"
2,love the colors,love a lot of their products but this one didn't last long. The battery fell out of the center and I had to tape it in.
4,Cute fun for kids,"This is a full-color set of stickers and forest background consisting of two 9"" x 12"" pages of stickers and two pages of background opened out to form one large (12"" x 18"") scene. The stickers are a sturdy material that's stronger than paper, and consist of fantasy characters like fairies, dragons and storybook characters, plus mushrooms, butterflies, rocks with faces and so on. The images are a detailed watercolor style and the colors are quite nice."
5,On the edge of your seat page turner,I loved this book. I could not put it down. I literally read it in one day. The chemistry between these two is explosive. The only negative thing I would say is I felt the age difference was a little to much.
5,What to say?,"This is book 7 in the Tall Dark and Dangerous series. Suzanne never ceases to amaze me. Each story is full of love, romance, suspense, great scenes...and yet all are so different. We learn about Admiral Jake in book 6 and after he lost his wife he was not out for much else. In comes Dr. Zoe Lange as the biochemist looking to help the gray team and........chemistry. The fact that Jake is way older than Zoe didn't affect me any. It was kind of interesting to see it all come together actually. You get introduced more to Mitchell and Lucky..I can't wait for Lucky's story. :-)However, I was really worried towards the end.....just read it, it's good!"
5,A remarkable love story,"The movie is excellent, the only thing make me frustrated is the DVD video and sound quality, not that satisfied as I expected. Hope next new release will be better."
2,Fails to deliver...,"I agree with an earlier review - the story *is* promising.However, I think the characters are two dimensional, and I felt disappointed when I read through to the end and wasn't hooked by any part of the story - plot/characters/delivery.I was particularly disappointed with this novel, because I recently purchased Ann o'Leary's other novel 'The Other Woman'. It was a FANTASTIC read. In fact, I found it hard to believe that this novel was written by the same author...If you want a quality read go and buy 'The Other Woman' over 'Julia's Song'."
3,Pearl Buck Biography,"This biography was very informative and I thought it gave me a good sense of who Pearl Buck was and why she wrote the way she did. She was almost a Chinese native with the insights of an outsider. The author was so impressed with her that I was never sure if I got an honest look at Buck. He quoted from her so much that it was more like an autobiography. He was stuck on telling her point of view as he saw it. I felt there were major gaps in telling how she related to the rest of the world. I knew a little about her activities in support of progressive causes but I felt he brushed over those, instead always in a hurry to tell you what a wonderful extremely intelligent woman she was. It was an informative book but written like a sycophant."
2,Not a good book,"Sadly, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews about this book. One of my biggest pet peeves is Big Misunderstanding in a book. It's even more irritating because the Big Mis leads to long separation and a deep emotional scar to both Hero and Heroine. Had I known this from the beginning I definitely wouldn't have picked up this book. To think that all of this could have been prevented by a simple dialog between Hero and Heroine. Grrr..!!Add to that the hero's treatment to Heroine that really leaves me cold. Throughout the book, I can't see a single reason for the heroine to fall in love so deeply with the hero. When the book finally comes to an end (a rather simplified ending considering what they've been through), instead of the satisfied feeling I normally get after reading a happy ending in a romance novel, I feel sorry for the heroine for always being the one who gives and gives and gives in their relationship. Not a happy ending in my book."
4,Good Stuff...,"Yeah, refreshing slab 'o' hardcore, Scarlet has definately got something going for them that every other kind of band like this seems to lack. This is their best album in my opinion, love the new singer."
1,USB Cup warmer,"I was VERY disappointed in the product!!! I had ordered 2 thinking one for work & one for home. But in trying the one for work, it did not heat up hardly at all--certainly not enough to keep a cup of coffee warm. My coffee was lukewarm at best!!! I would not recommend the product to anyone. My experience also discouraged a co-worker from giving one to another of our co-workers for Christmas. I have other cup warmers that do heat up beautifully, but they are wearing out & I wanted to replace them. Not with THIS product for sure!!!! Thumbs down!!! Linda, Weatherford TX"
4,Loved it!,"This is a great book! My son loves learning about the states, and it is not only a fun book for kids, but also adults."
5,great learning tool....,"My daughter told me that my young grandchildren love this book and the humorous way it was written. I found it through the reviews in here and wholeheartedly agree with the good ones and thank everyone for posting them. I haven't gotten to read it myself, as they are in another state...but I can assure you, it is a book to include in your little one's library! :D"
5,Very clever and funny...,This book is so much fun to read with my kids. They are learning so much US geography and they have a blast doing it. Very clever concept and the illustrations are great. We laugh all the way through this book!
5,all i can say,All i can say is that i used to love this book when i was younger so i am really glad furture generations get to read this book cause this is great book of states switching areas and why it wouldn't work
2,Poor sound quality,Found significant sound distortion when used with my IPOD -very disappointing. Also not comfortable to wear for extended periods.
1,I think I'm going to be sick.,"Would you look at that cover? Thats horrible! And take your peek inside the book, look at that table of contents! I wish I had done this before I ordered the book, that alone was enough to make me send it back for a refund!"
5,Worth a Reread,"This book was published almost 15 years ago, but it remains relevant today. For those who read it when it first came out, it's worth a reread. For those who aren't familiar with this volume, take a look at it for the first time.Roger Masters is ambitious in his aim--to use a conception of human nature based on evolutionary theory as a springboard for explaining political phenomena. Few people in the discipline of political science have the breadth of knowledge to attermpt this task.A look at the topics in the book illustrates: Masters explores the roots of altruism, bonding, aggression, society and language to explore, as the title of a key chapter has it, ""politics as a biological phenomenon."" As a philosopher, it is unsurprising that he uses his evolutionary framework to explore the nature of the state. He concludes this volume by examining some political phenomena in more detail.All in all, this volume is as relevant today as when it came out."
2,Really poor execution,"I was so excited to get this game because I am such a huge fan of the show. It's not fun. You have to track the dollars you win, but it doesn't come with scorecards to make this process easy. Basically, it's just a DVD full of game simulations with no rhyme or reason to how to PLAY the game effectively. I'll admit, I had fun fulfilling a lifelong dream of playing PLINKO, but ultimately think this game needs LOTS of work."
2,Might Be Worth It?,"My wife swears by these inserts and won't use anything else. I think they're overpriced junk, but since some holistic doctor (if you can really call a chiropractor a doctor) introduced her to them, she now thinks they're the world's greatest insoles...Personally, I'd just stick with the Dr. Scholl's that you can buy almost any store for about half the price. But, what do I know?"
4,Spenco Insoles,"Have enjoyed these insoles for about one month. Definitely better than regular ones bought at WalMart (Dr. Scholls). Hopefully durability will be just as pleasing as their support, comfort and workmanship."
3,Too much heel,"I think the heel is too narrow and too thick to be good for any sort of sport where you might need to change direction rapidly. The narrow and tall heel lends itself to lateral instability. I think if they widened the heel and made the overall insole the same thickness from heel to toe it would be perfect.As they are, they're great for a casual/work shoe. However, the thickness of the heel makes your once well-fitting shoe that much smaller.If you are used to low heel-drop shoes (meaning relatively flat from heel to toe), these are not the insoles for you."
5,"Excellent product, especially for big runners","I have been a big fan of this product for many years. I usually buy New Balance 993 running shoes for the road running, but their native insoles are too thin. So, pull them out and put these special insoles to allow better force cushioning. It is excellent, and really extends the life of expensive running shoes as well. I am a big guy, so better cushioning is critical for me to avoid injury, and this product is worth every penny you will spend on it."
5,Super Comfy,"These are absolutely great. Very comfortable and very helpful for my plantar fasciitis. Just be aware that since they're pretty thick, you need to have a spacious shoe that can accommodate them! But these are much better than any of the Doctor Scholls products I've tried so far. I love these and will use them continually."
4,I messed up,"When I first got these I just put them in my shoes. They were some Reebok tennis shoes that I wear for casual occasions. They hurt my feet. If I wore them for, say, 6 hours or more, the ball of my foot would hurt. Then I removed the old insoles from the shoes and put these insoles back in. No longer did I have two insoles in each shoe. Now I love them. They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day without any discomfort. Don't make my mistake."
5,Helped me tremendously with Plantar Fasciaitis,"After walking 1 mile to/from work in ""driving loafers"" every day, I started to get a horrible pain at the base of my heel in my right foot. The Podiatrist said it was a very common location to feel that pain and it was most probably Plantar Fasciaitis. He gave me a pair of these and they were incredible! I ended up ordering another pair from Amazon since the price and shipping are great. The only downside, the dr. recommended only these cross trainers bc of their added heel protection but these are a little too bulky for dress shoes. I ended up buying a pair of the regular Spenco ""heavy duty insoles."" They fit and seem to work but I only wear dress shoes, maybe 4 times a month.Bottom line, if you feel any bottom of the foot pain, give these a try!"
4,Spenco's!!!,"The difference in these inner soles compared to the originals that come with regular walking shoes, cross trainers and running shoes is night and day. You will not regret trying these!"
2,not so great...,"I have a very high arch and these still hit my arch causing pain in my foot. The heal cup is also very high, and pushed my foot to the wrong place in my shoes. Just did not work! Had to go back."
5,These are so comfortable I don't take them for granted.,These are by far the best insoles I've ever had. I can't live without them. Instead of slippers at home now I have to wear tennies with these in. I wear them in my work shoes as well. I swear by these now and I'd recommend them to anyone.
4,Loved It,"I would rate this higher than Superfeet.At half the price of Superfeet, you can't go wrong.However, Amazon did not carry all the sizes - what do you do if you are a man who wears 9 1/2 size shoes?:s"
2,Too Thick in the Heel Area,"They seem to be well-made and cushioning. However, the heel area is so thick, they push my foot out of the shoe. If you need a lift, these would work for you."
5,This CD is Greg Graffin at his very best!,"This CD is truly a beauty to hear. From the slow, beautiful, piano-driven melodies of ""Cease"" and ""Fate's Cruel Hand"" to the more upbeat and fast paced ""Maybe She Will,"" this CD has something for everyone. It is truly an achievement for Greg Graffin, his voice has never sounded better. It is also an amazing display of his composing talent. Unless you are the most die hard punk purist on Earth, get this CD! You won't be sorry."
2,Good...But Not my Genre,"Don't get me wrong, Greg Graffin is a great musician, lyricist, and singer, but this album just isn't my genre. And let's face it, if you are looking at this album, then you are a pretty big Bad Religion fan. While it is cool to hear ""Cease"" at a slow pace, I just can't get into this style of music."
4,"Not an ""Easy Read""","Very interesting information, and required reading for my yoga teacher training, however, not recommended as the first book you ever read on yoga."
5,Ranks in the TOP 10 of All-Time for Electronic CD's PERIOD!,"Without a doubt this CD has captured the hearts of so many now addicted electronic music fans...time and time again u hear people always refering to this CD as the CD they first heard that got them into Trance or Progressive music...I'm not just talking fans or everyday people..i'm talking about DJ's, Producers + MS'c...this CD is all-around AMAZING!...and should be one of the CD U must try out before u DIE!...It will change your view on music without a doubt my friends!DJ Sebas Arcabascio"
5,The album that started it all,"Having only listened to popy or house techno this Album was my guide into the world of TRANCE music. I first listened to TRANCEPORT shortly after 2000. I must say I have been and addicted ever since then. Yes this Album is old, but by far one of Oakey's bests if not his best. (I think ""perfecto presents another world disk 1 and 2"" is a close runner up) I have now seen Paul Oakenfold live in two concerts. One at the old ""red zone"" in Columbus Ohio and again at the Winter Music Conference 2002 in Miami Florida at a club called ""spin"". I must say this was the KING of this musical genre at one time. The newer albums just don't do it for me though. IMHO"
5,This CD is so...MONEY!!!!,All i have to say is that i have listened to all kinds of techno/dance/house and this is by far my new relegion in terms of music trance is the ultimate rush... from the first song on it was like being in a trance i just got it today and i have been listening all day if you can try to pick up paul oakenfold live from the creamfields it's also hype
3,"Trance is ok, if your in that mood","I love going to parties, especially when there are going to be some really good DJ's there. Now I went and saw Oakenfold last Tuesday, he really does a good job live. I'm not the biggest trance fan you'll find, but it is something to dance to. My fav. style would be house music, now thatsjust me but i love a hard beat with some phat base lines. Oakenfold is a good DJ, but I would highly suggest getting his Live in London CD...now thats what i call some good stuff!"
5,Oakenfold at his BEST,"First of all, not only would I say that this is one of the best trance mixes ever, but in my view, one of the best collections of music period.This is Oakenfold at his best. A far cry from what he has become, but nonetheless, an unbelievable mix.His mixing and track selection are FLAWLESS and the overall tone of the mix is soothing, pounding, and uplifting all at once.A MUST own for any fan of dance music. Highly recommended."
1,Poor Quality,Although this product is inexpensive I still thought it would be better than this. The inside was dirty with white spots on the leather. Some of the slots for the credit cards were not large enough for a regular sized card. All in all it is a very cheap wallet. Looks like I bought it off the street.
5,"Richard Komp: physicist, historian, and social engineer","Practical Photovoltaics is one of the finest, most comprehensive guides to the world of solar energy. The book starts with a beginer's course in solid state physical devices (which taught even an Electrical Engineer such as myself new things) and leads into the history of solar cell materials and procedures over the years. Next comes an in-depth discussion of the various types of materials, and how they are suited for different applications. He makes logical predictions about the future of some of these materials, and hints around at what new techniques scientists are starting to look at today.In the appendix, he even describes how to assemble your own array of solar cells for those who wish to try a hands-on approach to learning.Oh, yeah, one more thing: he has a decent list of recomended readings at the end of each chapter, allowing you to select topics that interest you to continue your reading."
3,"Strong on Content, Weak on Construction","This is an outstanding book as far as its content,descriptions,artwork,and overall information. It will satisfy any birdwatching enthusiatist in that respect. However, the the book is poorly constructed in that the weight (very heavy, a lot of pages) of the book and several readings will have the cover and binding coming apart. So be careful, not for younger children. I guess I should have looked for a hard cover edition instead."
3,Feels wonderful,It feels great on skin but have not noticed any brightening effects to my skin. It does last for 24 hours.
4,Van Helsing,This game is pretty awesome. I love it. Yes would for sure recommend to all of my friends and family.
3,Not Quite Like Silver To A Vampire,"I really wanted to like this game. The movie Van Helsing is not quite great, but it would at least qualify as pretty good. Unfortunately, this game can only qualify as good overall. I give it three stars because it really does have some good points, and many of the choices with weapon combos are pretty useful, but overall it just didn't hold up for a long enough duration to earn more than that. The first part of the game is actually pretty good, but once you get to the home of the late Doctor Frankenstein it starts to go downhill. Maybe if they had stayed a little closer to the ideas from the film it would have been better. I really don't know, but I wish the creators had put as much effort into the second half of the game as they did the first, because this could have been an amazing game if it could have kept a consistent level of playability. Overall, I would say it is worth a try, but not really worth keeping for longer than that."
1,Don't bother with this poorly made product,"These are the worst glass on the market. If you're looking for a great looking product that can't function at all, and will break through normal use, well, then the Docum Double Wall product line is for you.Had my set less then a week, used them less then 3 times before both of them broke. I'm pretty gentle with them too. Hand washed them, etc. They are pure junk."
1,why bother,"I was initailly excited when I saw these glasses. Looked like a great design. I ordered two sets. When they arrived one of the glasses was broken in transit. I sent them back for replacement and when they arrived another glass was broken during shipment. I cannot blame it entirely on the design of the glasses, since they were poorly packed. The second shipment was sitting on the bottom of the box with no cushioning. Amazon is refusing to replace them after the second damaged shipment, but is refunding the purchase price. I must say I am very disappointed. My advice is to save your money."
5,six drawer storage cart,"This product arrived in a timely manner, exactly as represented. It was a very good transaction, nice and smooth. I would definately recommend World wide Sourcing as a company that can be purchased from without any problems.Thank you"
5,Obagi Nu Derm Foaming Gel,"I've been using Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel on my face for a year now. I started using it together with the other obagi products since I started having break outs last year. It deeply yet gently cleanses the skin and after washing, you'll immediately feel that your skin is supple and fresh. It doesn't dry your skin too. When used twice daily (morning and night), the 200ml bottle will last for about 3 months because you only need to use less than 1 ml (two to three drops)per wash. I never had break-outs ever since."
3,Too expensive,"I've had the Guia Roji Atlas once and found it fairly good, but expensive.Then I found Quimera's Road Guide at about half the price at scale 1:1,750,000. First I thought this one wouldn't do it for me, but I was surprised that in many areas it is even more detailed and reliable than GR and their infamous inaccuracies (that's why you have to drive back ;-) ). Guia Roji doesn't offer gas stations, there's virtually no sight (archeology, nature, colonial) shown, and Quimera's design is just clearer and easier legible.And than there's the price..."
1,Pooooooo!,"I ordered this for my specific camera (Nikon Coolpix L110) and I checked several times that my camera model was included in the description, but sadly the covers were way to small and of no use to me! I reccommend this product to people with small digital cameras and not bigger point and shoots or professional models..."
1,More like Ultra Ripoff,"I have all 5 volumes and this is the only one I don't like. The selection of music is just plain bad. There are a few songs that are OK but most are just dull, dull, dull. I recommend going with one of the first 4 volumes instead."
2,Behold! The downfall of dance as we know it!,"Let's face it. The Ultra Dance compilation CDs have gone downhill ever since they let USA DJs mix the music. To find DJs for a good Dance/Trance/Techno compilation, Ultra Records should have went with a european DJ or group. Dance has never truly existed here at all. Listen to some Scooter and you'll know what dance is. And this is far from.The music on these CDs is hip hop and ambient with some keyboard thrown in.Very disappointing.The one track I do enjoy is the ""Fallen"" remix. It's a great trance track but not dance.So, overall I would say do not get this CD."
4,My First Ultra Dance,"My first Ultra Dance CD, I got to listen to some of it in B&N since it was a new release and liked a lot of what I heard.I bought it, brought it home and listened to it a few times, most definitely prefer the 1st disk to the 2nd, but there are a couple on the 2nd that I do enjoy."
2,You're better off buying Sex Pistols Dance Remixes Than This,"Absolute garbage. True disc one was okay. Disc two (except for iiO's ""Smooth"") sucked. It's like the remixers knew that they sucked,so they enhanced disc 1 with photos of some Ibiza-Looking Posuer Chick. If you want some good lovy-dovy dance music, I'd suggest you buy The Germ's ""MIA"" before buying ""Ultra Dance 0.5.""Bobby Ballistic"
2,"Nice story, poorly written","By the time I was ten pages into this book, I couldn't believe all the grammar errors and just poor writing that I found. I was wondering how these items got past an editor. So I turned to the front of the book and didn't see any publisher information...leading me to conclude that this book must have been self-published. If I had realized that I probably wouldn't have decided to read it. I did end up finishing it. The characters were decent, the plot was reasonably interesting (though uneven in quality)...but I just couldn't get past the amateur-level writing. Perhaps this book is worth reading if you are traveling to Zihuatanejo, but otherwise, I would give it a pass."
1,Causes iPod to freeze up.,This product caused my iPod to freeze up after minutes of use everytime it was used. I am returning it for a refund.
5,A VISIT THAT'S WORTH THE TIME,"TAPESTRY REVISITED is along with the birthday tribute CD to Marvin Gaye are, in my opinion, the only two such recordings worth anyone's while. Carole King should be very proud. Beautiful, absolutely beautiful--you feel the earth move!"
5,Baker Street CD,"Cool Baker Street CD, I have heard these songs on the radio for years, and finally have them on CD. Crank it on some Bose speakers and appreciate the full range of the tunes. Some of these songs have more impact than songs from really heavy bands, because the music is believable and not too abstract. Cool CD!... Cheers Amazon!!"
5,Perfect camera,"I love this camera, I got it for my wife a few weeks ago and today she cant imagine not having it. it works perfectly at night, I was surprised considering the low price.they also helped me install it over the phone."
4,"Great Choice, Great Service, Great Price.....Bombard Story.","Bombards Bombards Bombards Bombards everywhere...Bombards to the left...Bombards to the right...now this is a definite Bombard!!Great Choice, Great Service, Great Price.....Bombard Story.What a story!!!!!"
2,looks nice,This item worked well at first and may still but since I can't keep it on my ear anymore I will never know. The earpiece is cheaply made and recently snapped off. I would have expected this item to have lasted much longer than 4-5 months of light use.
1,Junk - Don't buy it,"Although the case is nice, the belt clip snapped in less than a week of ordinary wear. Save your money and buy something else."
5,"Hardcore, bouncing, Hip Hopping Funk","The album is bananas. It's a good old school, west coast hip hop CD. Sicx spits like a loony, nut job, while rapping about gang life, street life, crooked cops and all the jealousy and drama that he's experienced while growing up.The beats are funky as hell and drenched with samples. My only problem with the beats is that many of them I have heard variations of on other hip hop albums, but that's how it is with many hip hop albums.Still a great album that I recommend for fans of Brotha Lynch Hung and X-Raided or any other hardcore hip hop.Put it in, turn it up and just let it commence playing.Also, a great album to crash a party and offend everyone.(Yeah, the price tag is currently ridiculous on Amazon, so I got my copy off of ITunes for $9.99.)"
4,If You Like The First Lynch and X-Raided You'll Dig This,This album reminds me alot of the first X-raided. Ya know song blending into song some sampled beats throughout. 2-3 hit album but the hits are good ones.
5,A worthwhile book.,"This book provides an excellent alternative method of using egg tempera to the traditional methods detailed in Daniel Thompson's book. The author shows that egg tempera is a lot more flexible medium than many people believe. Mr Vickrey attempts to show how some of the myths about egg tempera are self limiting. Vickrey's paintings themeselves have at times the air of whimsical magical realism tinged with a nostalgia for lost childhood days. They may or may not be your cup of tea, but if you are interested in Tempera painters and the techniques and materials required to paint this way then I highly recommend this book."
4,Word to Ak Son!,"ClassicLyrics -------- 9/10Production courtesy of Large Professor --------- 10/10Album Cover --------- 10/10Theme --------- 10/10Standout Tracks --------- Da bomb,Excercise,Ak Ah Ah.Guest Appearances ----------- None Son.Overall ---------- 93 was the year and Hip Hop was alive."
4,different than expected,"This album is nothing at all like the Sugar Ray I know now. ""fly"" is the only song on the cd that sounds even remotely like Mark McGrath today. The whole thing blew me away completly. It sounds somewhat like old 311 meets old Limp Bizkit mixed with Linkin Park. A song I recommend is ""Stand And Deliver"" although the whole thing is an amazingly refreshing sound from what i'm used to."
4,"Wow, I didn't know Sugar Ray went hardcore","It all started one day when I didn't have any music to listen to for my CD player. I went through my friends CD collection and I saw this Sugar Ray CD. Since I was bored of all the other CD's he had, I put this one in. When I listened to them they sounded like a whooole different, harder band (comparing to 14:59). It definetly impressed me. They have a very unique sound in their mix of punk, hardcore, and some reggae. I gave this CD 4 stars because I am picky but I would label his CD a ""punk"" album."
2,not a good cd,read the the second reveiw from the bottom that says a music fan from the east coast. the olny good song on this cd is fly.
3,I've heard better,Sugar Ray has done better music. Their new CD 14:59 is much better. I reccomend buying that.
2,shitty album with one good song,"After i had heard the one single for Floored, which is ""Fly"", i bought the album.Now i know why ""fly"" was the only single. This album sounds like it was put together in about 5 minhutes. You should get their 2nd album, ""14:59"" which is a much better bargain."
2,INSA not so good.,"This clock looks good and is in a sturdy housing. However, there are definite QA issues. The buttons are plastic ( I think the Yugo era was metal) and protruded through two holes in the wooden housing. They were jamming out of the box. I rasped the holes a touch wider and they functioned fine after that. The setting dial was working fine on one side but sticking/jumping on the other making very hard to set precisely. I oiled (with WD40) and the 'bad' side works a little better now and the 'good' side started working a little worse. I would have sent the clock back but I have already opened it up, rasped wood, etc... It is functional, just hard to set. I don't have a lot of experience with chess clocks, but intuition tells me you could spend your money better. I suspect someone could get a real lemon (worse than mine) and another person may get a good one...perhaps they were better under communism."
2,romance,"I just saw this film last night. It was ok. The nude scene on the beach was oboviously not the real actors and didnt need to be in the film. If you can get it for cheap, or off netflix, i'd say it is worth an hour and a half."
3,You Get What You Pay For,Sometimes there is a reason you can get five movies on one DVD for about $5. While the sound has been digitally mastered the the prints are murky and/or greenish with a fair amount of flicker.This is a Hearst Entertainment/King Features set so it begins with those pointless movie excerpts leading into the annoying theme song. It's sad that Columbia hasn't released an actual set with the Chic Young opening credits intact and restored prints. I recommend this set if you are a Blondie fanatic and do not mind VHS quality on a DVD.
3,Brighter than the picture,"I ordered this for a musical I am going to be performing in. I wanted an orange hoodie that wouldn't be too bright and not too dull. The picture looked like the perfect shade that I wanted. When I got it, I was surprised by how bright it actually was. It really is more like a safety orange than the color of an actual orange (fruit). I tried washing it to see if it would fade a little, but that didn't work. I did notice after the first wash, the lining on the inside began to release a lot of fabric like strings and snags. The pull string even came out after just the 1st wash.I will admit that I still like the the look of it despite it not being the shade I wanted. I will probably use it for when I run in the winter, but not for the purpose I purchased it for. I probably should have returned it when I noticed it wasn't the right color I wanted, but too late for that."
2,Mediocre at best,"I got this CD after listening to the Welcome Interstate Managers CD, and found it a little below rudimentary. None of the sharp wit and huge melodies that made their most recent effort so worthwhile. Very basic, very stripped down, and lacking any real spark."
3,"Their first album is interesting, but wait till you hear their others!!!","Fountains of Wayne debuted in classic fashion: great ideas, but not so great execution. Evidenced by their later albums, ""Utopia Parkway"", ""Welcome Interstate Managers"", and ""Out of State Plates"", the maturity in their lyrics and depth of songwriting really stands out as intelligent, personal, and downright addictive. If you enjoy most any flavor of the rock genre and almost story-like lyrics, you should give any album except their first album a listen - I guarantee you'll be hooked.Great band who will be producing exceptional music for many years to come."
5,Well done!,"Bravo to Mr. Crole for this work, which is a step towards ensuring that the magical world of tobacco pipes will endure!I have only one minor gruble: Alfred Dunhill cites in his Book of the Pipe a theory that tobacco was not introduced to Africa from the Americas but the other way around. It might have added a little interest for this to have been mentioned . . . perhaps in later editions?All in all, a splendid book which will appeal to veteran pipe smokers and beginners alike."
5,SanDisk 1 GB SD Card,"This is an excellent memory card for storing whatever data is needed. I purchased it to save camera pictures, in which it worked perfectly.Previously, I purchased a SanDisk 4 GB SD Card. But unfortunately, it was non-compatible with my outdated camera with a limitation of utilizing only up to a 1 GB SD card. Thererfore, prior to purchasing any SD memory Card, you may want to read the specifications of the devise you will be using it for.Enjoy!"
5,Never a problem,SanDisk are the most dependable SD cards. I never worry about losing any of my photos.
5,Surprisingly funny.,"You wouldn't think that an adventure set in the land of the Killing Fields could be humorous, but the author gives us a side of Cambodia that many of us have never seen. Without downplaying the violence and chaos, Asma shows us that there is far more to this part of the world than just misery. The local people he meets are warm, hopeful, and deeply spiritual people, and the expats are quirky characters that make you laugh one minute and horrify the next. The Buddhism here is complex too and Asma proves an excellent guide."
1,Why people like that?,"Hey, this is not a pop-rock band. They're a pretty faces band. Handred percent of false music, standard production. Give hamburgers to the masses..."
5,Great Album....clap clap=),"I first saw this wonderful group on saturday night live and i was amazed of how much life and energy they have in their music. FOrgiven, Not Forgiven is one of those albums that after u listen to it the first time, it sure sounds strange, but after u get tempted to listen to it again and again, u CANT STOP. THe album is full of magnificent melodies and great songs, such as Heaven Knows, SOmeday, Secret Life, Leave Me Alone, and the greatest song ever, RUNAWAY. go get the CD now, u wont regret it=)"
3,Hill Street Blues Season 3,"I am sure I would have enjoyed this as much as the previous ones I purchased, however I ordered the online viewing version by mistake so I called and cancelled this order. I never viewed it and am waiting to purchase it in DVD form to add to my collection."
5,Die-Hard HSB Fan Wants Entire Series on DVD,"Please FOX, end the agony! Give us the remaining HSB seasons for our collections and satisfy all the die-hard fans out here! We've been ever-so-patient! Hill Street is the best cop drama ever and had one of the best ensemble casts ever and still holds up. Please don't keep it hidden away in some Hollywood vault, but share it with devoted fans and create new fans too! Please and Thank you in advance. Hurry, we are salivating from waiting so long!"
4,Hidden meaning of C'mon Daddy,"I only recently bought this CD. It has some real gems, especially The Outdoor Type, which I'd heard in the film The Tao of Steve... but the only reason I'm writing this review is because I only just realized what the song C'mon Daddy is about.Here are some lyrics: ""I feel like Steven is my father but I don't know why/But I realized it when I looked in his eyes.... Didn't know I was your baby until the age of nine/Didn't know I was your babe for such a long long time...""The real giveaway: ""Now we're back in the saddle..."" I still can't believe I didn't get it the first time. It's a song about how Liv Tyler discovered that Steven Tyler of Aerosmith was her real father!I'm sorry, but that is just so damned clever it kills me. And for that alone (plus much much more) you should buy this album. And what the hell, buy It's a Shame About Ray, too."
4,A good model,A good model. Not easy to put together but the end result is attractive. Could do with a motor and steering for better play value. RC would be great. Cost is too high.
1,Foil Broke,Two weeks into using this product the foil broke on one side. Not just a small break but a big one. So now I have to use one side. I used the previous foil for a long time. Would not buy from this vendor again. Very cheap workmanship.
3,First Impressions,"I was not familiar with Crowded House's work until this album. I'm not very impressed, lead singers voice and musicianship of group was mediocre, lyrics were interesting. To compare this album with works by the Beatles(one of the reasons I ordered it) is sacrilegious. For every Eva Cassidy,100's of performers and groups are relatively obscure for a purpose. However, don't tear down if you can't build up, the last(title) cut combining extensive Maori chorus with log drumming was exquisite. ""Tis a gift to be simple"""
4,Brilliant,Swansong for this band. What a brilliant effort. Love the Finns way back to thier Split Enz days to today. This is a hypnotic work with tons of beautifully written songs. I recommend getting this as well as all the other releases of Crowded House. They show how it should be done.
4,"Edwin McCain...the ""unknown""","I had never heard of Edwin McCain until I heard the song ""I'll Be"" on the radio a little while ago. I fell in love with it and would sing it throughout the day. Still though, I didn't know who was the brilliant singer. It wasn't until I saw the soundtrack for ""A Cinderella Story"" that I finally found out who sang this! I HAD to have the CD! I must say, although my favorite song is still probably ""I'll Be"", I love all of the songs on this CD. (Now I have more songs to sing throughout the day!!) Each song is different--and beautiful--in its own way. If you like ""I'll Be"", I'm sure you'll like the CD!"
1,Not too good,I bought this cd because of I'll Be but the rest of the cd was pretty bad. Nothing like that song. If you like I'll Be youll probably hate the rest of the cd.
2,very average,"This is basically an album full of rock ballads. It's pretty listenable but there're only about 2 good songs, the rest are melodies which will never stand the test of time. If you're only considering this album coz of ""I'll Be"", just get the single; the rest of the sngs aren't quite worth the money."
3,Misguided Roses - Edwin McCain,"I'm one of those audiophiles that purchase an album for one song when I want it. In this case it was Edwin McCain's ""I'll Be"". The CD does not disappoint, and the song is a wonderful medley about love and relationships as well as commitment. I'll explore more of Edwin's work on this album as time goes by, but I recommend it for anyone that wants to expand their music library."
4,Edwin can do better,"Like many others, I bought the CD for ""I'll Be"", which turned out to be the only really good song on the album. This guy definately needs some help on his lyrics. However, he has a great sound, a voice that makes you want to hear more of it. I don't regret buying the CD, I'm only hoping that Edwin McCain can get his groove back to put out more hits like ""I'll Be."""
2,I wouldn't if I were you...,"This book is irritatingly repetitive and needlessly jargon-packed. The essays are too shortly excerpted, and often uninteresting. If you wish to teach or learn only that the things we say, write, and/or do convey meaning, societal training, and possibly false assumptions on our part, this is your book (especially if you like very floppy bright red square things). If you would like to teach or learn more than that fundamental Toulmin-based premise, look somewhere else."
3,difficult even in class,i am currently using the book/dvd in my asl class. i find it difficult to follow without instruction and some of the signs go against several dictionaries and aslpro.i'm not sure where the signs in the book are the most common as they vary from many of the ontario signs i first studied. the dvd does help but i find it intensely boring.this is not a book i would suggest to learn on your own.
2,Signing workbook & video,"I am disapoointed in the condition of the workbook. I feel the workbook and video was over priced.For the price that was paid, I expected the condition to be better."
4,parent support,"A good overview of toys that support early child development . Helpful in suggesting to new parents ways to engage with their child.An overview of the toys use at different milestones for infant stimulation. Reader friendly, clear layout."
5,Excellent tool for ALL parents with small children,"I have used [...] for guides for buying gifts for children often. When I learned that Dr. Toy launched a book called, ""Smart Play, Smart Toys"", I purchased ten, one for myself and to give as gifts to friends with small kids. I love the book in how it is organized. It is easy to find the right age group and it is a fast read with the most pertinent stuff you need to know. I also like that it lists milestones by age and suggestion of toy lists by age category. I recommend this book for anyone with small children. It covers up to age 10+. It stimulates new ideas for exposing and educating and entertaining children and you can use it as a guide over the years."
2,New York in your pocket,The best thing about this book is it's size it fits handilly in your pocket. Planning a visit to New York in February 2002 i did hope for more from this guide. Its size limits the entries to a few lines which is the books main problem. The Bars section may come in useful but Virgin will have to do better if they want to rival Time Out's NY guide.
3,"Okay, but very different","If you've already heard Jill Sobule's self-titled and loved it, you may or may not like this album. I didn't...it's harsh, a bit flat, as if she were afflicted by the pills mentioned in the title cut. The bounce and joy and enthusiasm that so drew me in in her previous album have been transmuted, in most of the cuts, to something more serious, even harsh. At times she's brooding, her voice is rougher than before. If that's the kind of music you like, it might be a good album...I wouldn't know, since I don't. But if you're expecting more of what she delivered on her last album, don't. The flights of fancy and dreams have been subsumed in the modern rock standard mix of angst and anger."
1,OUCH!!!!,"I've never had a more uncomfortable shoe. They hurt my feet and my lower legs and I now have three black toenails from these shoes. The company says your feet have to get adjusted to the shoes and I did give it a go for about three weeks, leading up to a tournament (I play competitively, 3-4 times a week). But I couldn't take it anymore and went back to my old shoes for the tourny. Was such a relief to be back in my old shoes. Totally regret buying these shoes and now I'm stuck with them since I wore them for a few weeks. Maybe others will have a different experience, but I'll never buy these again."
2,frustrating,"This toy is very frustrating, for a dog and for the owner. It makes my dog rather hyper and makes her bark too much. There's nothing wrong with the manufacture of the toy; I just don't think it works well as a device to keep a dog happily busy."
3,"Okay, I Guess...","While the concept is great - my dog LOVES empty pop bottles - he doesn't have any interest in this particular toy. I think it is pretty sturdy, though I may not be the best judge as he hasn't really played hard with it. He has a ton of toys and this is his least favorite. It really is a good idea though and I do like how well it was made."
3,be careful,"my dog played with this at first, until she was swinging it & decided to let it go & broke a lamp in my house. Looks like she won't be getting this toy back!"
2,Too heavy and only for food motivatewd dogs,"I bought this based on a friend's recommendation, but was disappointed.Although I checked the sizing chart, the item seemed too big and heavy for my dog. I recommend going one size down from what they recommend.Also - although my dog loves playing with her stuff-a-ball toy, she will barely go near this thing. So - the one doesn't necessarily imply like for this item.I suspect this would work best for a dog with strong food motivation. My doesn't like it at all.As a toy, it's not much fun, unless a dog really wants food badly and is willing to put a lot of work into it."
1,Turn the volume down!!!,"The toy is so so. I enjoy the buster cube and atomic treat dispenser much better. The hard plastic jar against the tile floors is VERY distracting.The tug-a-jug kept my dog entertained just as long as the other 2 dispensers. After a while, he just gave up and would lie down next to it.The noise this thing made was just unbearable."
3,Tug a Jug,"I thought this toy would be great for my dog. He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great. However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber ""tug"" rope was broken in half. I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged. He still uses it though, even without the rope. Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown. Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it."
3,Made my dog go ballistic!,"When i got this for my dog, Hilde, i gave it to her and then left for about half an hour. It had her breakfast kibble in it. When i came back to check up on her she was trying to use it but couldn't figure it out. There was also the same amount of food when i came back. I had to try to help her with it and it was still hard for her. It was pretty sad because she was going ballistic because she couldn't get the food out. It seemed like a good idea at first but i dont think my dog very much liked it. There are scent holes at the bottom and she could see the treats inside so she would try to eat the plastic! Either this wasnt a very well thought out toy or my dog is dumb! Hope this review helps."
3,Good Toy--A few Drawbacks,"My labs like to play with this toy-- which is good. I don't put treats inside it and they still will play with it and fight over it.It seems durable and it seems safe. The problems are two fold. If the dogs play with it on a hard surface, like a concrete patio or a wooden deck, it makes a lot of noise as they drag the bottle end around and bounce it off of objects. Also my Labs will grab this thing by the rope end and swing it around in the air and it becomes a weapon of mass destruction whacking fixed objects or another dog while being whirled around. Nothing is perfect. I let the dogs have play time with it regardless of the negatives."
2,Bad for extreme chewers and smart dogs,"I purchased this for my Westie because I work and she's home alone in her crate most of the day. I wanted to give her something to stimulate her mind, so she didn't get too bored while I was away. I received many recommendations on this toy, and read many great reviews. Here are my issues with it.1) My dog may only be 16 lbs., but she's an extreme chewer. The product says it's durable, but it's not. She almost had it chewed through by day one.2) Apparently, my dog is a genius. She figured out how to dispense the treats, just not the way they're supposed to be dispensed. She unraveled the rope. Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats. For extreme chewers, and smart dogs, it's not durable or stimulating enough for them."
1,Not for powerful chewers!,"I bought two of these for my 16 month black lab and my 3 year old Golden Retriever. At first they nosed it and tossed it, but within 5 minutes my black lab had ripped the rubber stopper in half and dumped out the kibble! Maybe he is smarter than I thought!The toy is completely unusable now and we are sedning it back.I think this would be a great toy for a smaller or less voracious chewer. If your dog is a strong chewer, I would get something else to entertain them."
3,Just Okay,It's kind of noisy so my dog doesn't love it. It's kind of an awkward design. There are better treat toys out there - my dog loves the disc shaped one.
3,My dog is afraid of it!,"I have a one year old lab mix that we adopted from a shelter. Got him as a puppy. I got this toy because I work out of the house, and he is constantly wanting me to play with him. Thought this would be ideal. Have no idea whether this is a good toy or not because my dog is afraid of it. He does not like anything that makes noise!! So, in theory it is a great toy, in practice, in my house, it's a bust!"
2,Busy Buddy,"Ughh ..l I tried getting a toy for my puppy to play with to dispense treats.. it worked for a day.. my puppy was slammimg this jug around .. and the treats would dispense out .. he whipped it around he loved it ..but it cracked on the bottom and that's that.. so out of commission .. but nosey if you do not have and carpets or rugs in your home.. i have hard wood floor .. it was loud and nosey ,which was ok for a few minutes but then, i had to take it away .. good idea but my pup is 3 months old pitbull/german shepard mix.. he is active so now i ihave to shop for another treat dispenser.. i will submit a video of what i am talking about .. i just purchased another toy I will tell you how it goes .. i ordered the squirrel that dispenses treats i heard it was strirdy !!"
3,Depends what you are looking for - not for strong chewers.,Was a little too hard for my dogs after initial training. One dog gave up. The other dog kept at it and chewed through the rope within an hour. There was a product insert suggesting to put a ball inside if your dog ate through the rope. That actually turned out to be more fun for my dogs because they aren't so big into the ropes and prefer to push their food dispensing toys around. I don't think this toy will last for long based on thickness of plastic.
2,DO NOT BUY FOR ACTIVE DOGS OR PUPPIES!,"Unfortunatly, we bought this at a high end dog store. We paid $22.00. My 6 month old RR puppy figured the tug and throw to release the food quickly. We have had it for two weeks and I want my money back. The plastic jar busted open with sharp edges. Super dangerous."
2,Busy Buddy Tug a Jug,"This toy does not entice my pet at all. I am ""underwhelmed"" and actually regret purchasing it. I could have spent my money better purchasing nylabones which my pet loves."
2,The lid cover broke within 5 minutes,"I thought this dog toy would perfectly fit my 11 month Samoyed and provide the durable playful time. Unfortunately, my Samoyed was not just rolling the bottle, her chewing on the knots caused the bottle to fly around and when it hits my fragile ceramic floor, it broke (both the lid cover and my newly set floor).. *sigh*Maybe this product should be used in a carpeted environment only."
2,Not for a smaller dog,"This gizmo is HUGE! If it weren't so much trouble I'd send it back. Looks like a great product for a St. Bernard, but for my 13-pound Shih Tzu it's overkill. There may be a smaller version, but I can only imagine what the hard plastic would sound like on my tile floors!"
5,dog loves,"i had to give this away, because my aussie loved it so much, every time the cat or other dog walked by she'd snap. she really liked this toy and it gave her something to do,"
4,"Great, but potentially dangerous.","This is one of my dog's favorite toys. It has entertained her for many hours. Prior to her getting the rope out of it, she would swing it around like a mace or weapon and bang people on the knees if they weren't paying attention. Now that the rope has been shredded, I strategically put a larger treat in to prevent the kibble from just falling out. Good idea, but the design could be modified for safer play."
3,"So So, There Are Better Out There","I bought this for my 4 month old Frenchie and he just seems absolutely disinterested in it lol. The way the bottle is shaped along with the rope it's almost ""by accident"" that the treats come out. He plays with it for about 5 minutes but then goes back to his IQ TREAT BALL that I also bought on Amazon. I feel like you have to basically flip this bottle upside down and mess with the rope for it to come out and I don't see Jackson being able to do that. If the bottle is laying flat as in the picture, how does the treat come up the neck and out the hole? He does grab the rope and run around with the bottle but I can tell this is not his most favorite toy."
1,Didn't last long,"Have a 6-month old black labrador. She destroyed toy in less than a week. When the container broke, it was very sharp."
3,Good and Bad,"Works great for my GSD with one exception. I had to remove the rubber rope from the bottle. Otherwise it would be impossible to get the food out!! Maybe this is because his food is larger I really dont know however, with the rope gone he stays active until all the food is out. Good buy since I purchased it from target at the clearanced price of 3 dollars!"
1,Dog can't Get treats out!,"I thought this toy would be amazingly stimulating. If you look at the top of the bottle, it is nearly impossible for a dog to get the treat out. I wanted a toy that would engage and keep my Cojack busy.. She can't get the treats out. Please fix the design!!"
2,Not worth it...you'll need to spend more money,"So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'. It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions. I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy. They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought. AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes. It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and/or up the quality of this product."
1,Disappointed,My Min-Pin shows absolutely no interest in this item. He is usually very receptive to anything that dispenses treats.
2,Dog won't touch it!,"I have a 7 pound miniature poodle, and she is terrified of this toy. She tugged it a couple of times when we first gave it to her, but it made so much noise she has never messed with it again. I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds."
1,My dog broke it quickly,"I bought this toy and put one of my dogs in her crate with it. I just filled it with a handful of kibble. 1/2 hour later the Tug a Jug was broken. My dog had chewed the end off where it screws on. Her chewing destroyed the threads so the toy is useless. She's a 55 pound food motivated dog, medium chewer. My original worry about the Tug a Jug was that it would be noisy on hard floors. It never made it that far. I had better luck with the Busy Bone toy, although she can get the Gnawhide rings off pretty quick. At least that one is still usable."
2,Not all dogs love it,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, but unfortunately neither one of my two dogs were at all interested."
3,Not for use on hard floors,"This is definitely more challenging than a tricky treat ball or a twist n treat saucer, and our 55 lb pit mix really enjoys it. However, it should not be used on hard floors. After only 3 weeks the entire top is completely cracked, and it's only a matter of time until the entire thing is going to be broken. Upon discovery of the cracks we started letting our dog play with this on the carpet, but it was too late; the damage was done. We considered duct-taping the top to keep it in place and all in one piece, but it was too difficult to try to get the kibble in to the little space on the rope end. We will probably buy another one of these since it is so much for for our dog, but I wish that it was more durable so that he could play with it in the kitchen on the tile floor. Allowing him to play with it on carpet = lots of vacuuming of the kibble crumbs!"
2,not worth it,I have yet to figure out how to get the bottom off to place treats into the toy. So I put them into the top which was difficult and they are hard for the dogs to get out. There are better toys than this one.
5,Tug -a- Jug,My dog is on her second one and will be needing a third soon. She (Bella (Morkie)) will play with this for hours.
3,"Kept her interest, then she destroyed it","My dog really enjoyed this. she spent hours trying to get the treats out. but in the first 10 minutes she chewed the plastic 'rope' in half out of frustration. So now the toy doesn't work as intended, but still i put her dog food in there since i know she'll be able to get it out pretty easily, it will just take more work than the bowl. This is a really great toy, just wish the rope would have lasted a day. so be sure to supervise play before you leave your dog with this one."
1,waste of money!!!,"my dog loved it at first but an hour later the plastic bottle cracked!! maybe this toy should be kept ""indoors"" only :("
3,"Looks like fun, but my dogs ignored it.","I think the problem with this toy is that the rope fills up too much of the bottle neck which makes getting a treat out of the container nearly impossible. It is certainly a sturdy product though, but having Boxers I can just imagine one of them grabbing it by the rope and swinging it around, and breaking something in my house."
2,Hard Plastic,"This is made out of hard plastic. I bought this for my Shepherd that loves to chew. She's not interested in playing with it at all. It's made to be a educational for dogs, I guess she just got bored with it. On the plus side your human kiddos will like it."
2,bummer :(,I thought that this was going to be great for out larger breed dog. Unfortunately it only holds really tiny pieces of treats. I cannot see how a dog small enough to eat such small pieces could pick this heavy toy up.
3,fun while it lasts,"This is a great interactive toy. We used it for every feeding. A great way to slow down the doggie vacuum cleaner. Unfortunately, the toy is made of hard plastic and while we didn't care about the noise, the plastic itself eventually cracked from the beating on the hard floors. We continued to use the toy cracked, until the lid finally cracked and was no longer able to be screwed on. All said, the toy lasted about two months. You decide if the price is worth it. For us, we'll be looking for an interactive feeding toy that is made of hardier material."
2,Plastic can crack from a strong chewer,"I have a three-year old lab/chessie mix. She's a fast eater and a strong chewer so I bought her the Tug-A-Jug to slow down her eating (and give her something to chew on).It does slow her down. It can take her up to a half hour to eat a meal instead of two minutes.I've given her food a couple of times without the bottle, but she prefers the bottle now.Updated section!As she become a strong chewer, it's fairly easy for my dog to chew off the bottom part that's screwed on. This leads to the possibility of her swallowing a sharp piece of plastic.It's a great toy, but only for dogs that aren't extremely strong chewers. My dog loved this, but it's too much of a safety hazard for her to have again."
3,not as well researched as it could have been,"There are a couple inaccuracies which could have been corrected had the author spoken with anyone in the alternative music scene in Portland (to which Mr. Van Sant is connected). The gender of the sound engineer of Male Noche is incorrect (Pat Baum is a woman, drummer of early punk band the NeoBoys, and former dj on KBOO radio), and Chris Monlux and Mike Quinn's collaboration is called MonQui Productions, not Monique Productions.I was really enjoying this book, until the inaccuracies noted made me suspicious of what other errors might exist. I didn't finish it."
2,Dee Dee Pont Eau (No!),"Let me start by making it clear that I like Dee Dee Bridgewater and appreciate her talent as a singer. I have been a fan since her recordings back in the early 90s.I am also a big fan of many of the legendary French singers and the ""French Songbook"" of standards. I actually missed this release by Dee Dee when it came out, but spotted it recently while browsing a local music shop. I picked it up straight away and anticipated listening to it with great expectations!I have to say that I was highly underwhelmed by the recording. I'm actually surprised to read in other reviews here that she lived in France for 20 plus years since one of the things I couldn't get by was what I though was a really horrible singing style with the French language. It just made me want to cringe!Anyway, bottom line: Dee Dee Good, Dee Dee singing in French, not so much!"
5,Surprenant!!! (amazing),"I happen to have heard this CD featured on a particular website and I fell in love with it. It really takes me away. Its seductive and fun. I don't speak french too well but the way Dee Dee sings the songs allows to me create a clear vision of what is going on. My favorites are Mon Homme, Et Maintenant and Dansez Sur Moi. This CD will definitely last the test of time."
4,J'ai Deux Amours,"Dee Dee""s singing is very playful on this album. She is quite accomplished and comfortable with the French language. The minimal use of instruments is so pleasurable...lots of accordian....used as a jazz instrument ! There is a wonderful feeling of spontaneity on this CD.Her fur coat modeling on the cover is unfortunately... rather Gauche.But I can hardly think of anyone having so much fun with the music .Of course Europeans support American Jazz more than Americans...And the French seem to love DeeDee,....on this recording she loves them right back.!"
5,Diana Krall's name can be spoken,"in the same breath as Billie Holiday, Sara Vaughn and Betty Carter.She has the style, power, control and range to put her in this league. This is first class, world class jazz. Buy it."
3,"Man, has she improved!","The first time I heard Ms. Krall was in All For You, her best album to date. Since then, I've bought everything she's released, and Only Trust Your Heart was something of a disappointment. I mean this in reference to Ms. Krall's singing, which is nowhere as elegant as that of later recordings. Here, she is still shouting in quite a few songs - not as much as to remind one of the dreaded Whitney Houston, but enough to make me want to warn Amazon.com customers who haven't heard this album. I must say, however, that her piano playing is pretty much as good as ever and that Christian McBride's bass is the instrumental highlight (Sorry, Ray Brown)."
5,A Huge Talent,"Diana Krall once again proves that her talent is enormous. This is an excellent example of mellow jazz vocals at it's best. She sings and plays like no one else around today. This is a great Cd to sit back relax and just enjoy, and I do mean enjoy."
4,Great for Brit Lit,"I used this in my Brit Lit class as part of an introduction to Shakespeare. I only used some of the episodes, otherwise we could spend an entire term just watching this documentary. But I thought it was great and I learned a lot myself. I even made handouts for the episodes I used, check my blog to get the handout link. They're free! [...]."
2,"Okay, but...","Great idea, but... I like the idea of being able to attach to a surface by suction cups. This works very well. However, 15X magnification is far too strong. To use, I need to go up real close to the mirror to see clearly. In fact, in applying makeup, I have difficulty using an eye liner pencill, as the pencil can hit the mirror while I am applying...showing how close I need to get to the mirror to see!"
5,"Fun, Fun record....more like LWTCDI than anything they've done in 20 years","FINALLY!Even though this is a collection of covers, it's more like Look What the Cat Dragged In than anything else...it only took them 20 years to get back to their incredible roots! BUY.Also check out Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded, heavier, but a ton of fun, with that raw edgy fun sound."
1,Why bother?,"This album really was a disappointment for life-long fans like myself. Poison has been notorious for their re-release / re-working of the same old material with all of their live albums, greatest hits albums, etc., and they have put out very little new material in the past decade. When they have put out new material, it is often what I would consider sub-par (i.e., the new part of ""Power to the People"" and all of ""Hollyweird""). On the heels of all of these disappointments comes this album--a cover album--in which there really isn't any inspiration or innovation in the re-makes of these songs. Honestly, I think that Poison has lost its edge, and I feel as though they are taking advantage of their fan-base."
4,Great movie.,This is a great movie as the others in the series. It is only unfotunate that they don't come as full set. I would like to order all of them but shipping is to much.
1,Dave Hunt just doesn't know the subject matter,Dave Hunt doesn't know the subject matter. Dave Hunt's book brings nothing more then an emotional response rather then offer a exegetical response to the subject matter. Dave convinced me that calvinism is now biblical.Thanks Dave Hunt
1,Erroneous Assertions,"Having read St. Augustine's City of God, John Calvin's Institutes, Martin Luther's The Bondage of the Will, and having just finished my tenth reading of the entire Bible, I am convinced that Hunt misses the meaning of God's love. This is a book not about God's love, but about man's gloriousness. It would fit well among the writings of the Age of Enlightenment, except for its bad scholarship. Particulars about the author's misinterpretation of the above books abound in reviews by other sensible readers, so I shall spare you... Readers who give this book more than one star fascinate me. My conclusion is that they have read neither the Bible (unless they have read it in their sleep) nor the works of the theological giants mentioned above. For that they are to be grievously pitied."
1,About as theologically adept as Shelby Spong,"It is almost laughable that, first, some one who claims to be an evangelical throws more mud than a 19th century editorialist, and secondly has the audacity to question the Calvinist/Covenantal theology when he shows that he does not even have a theological leg to stand on. Even basic tenants of Calvinism are misunderstood or not understood at all. The worst part of the whole thing is that those who are yet babes in need of milk will take this curdled milk as food. When one compares this suppossed refutation of Calvinism with Calvin's Institutes, Augustine's City of God, or Berkhof's Systematic Theology, he will notice a few glaring differences: A lack of basic logic, no viable alternative, no biblical quotes, a complete lack of understanding of the precepts of Calvinism, and finally no real understanding of the totality of scripture. A very sad book, it is no surprise that Tim LaHaye likes it."
1,He misunderstands sovereignty,"Unfortunately, this author is one of many who misunderstand what Calvinism means. He views free-will and sovereignty as polar opposites. The more sovereignty exerted, the less room for free will there is. It's tragic, but oh so common when stuff like this gets into print. The reason is that he equates God's sovereignty with the type of sovereignty that man has the capacity to exert. With man, they would be polar opposites, but God's sovereignty is so much larger and greater than what we can exert that there is room for free-will to operate within the spectrum of God's sovereignty. There is no conflict or paradox, and nearly all Hunt's points are erroneous due to failing to understand this."
1,Same old...,"From Rev. Roger Smalling, PCAProfessor, Miami International SeminaryAuthor of Unlocking GraceA good way for theology students to gain confidence in Reformed theology is to read arguments by Arminians. So with Hunt's ""What Love Is This?""Hunt repeats arguments refuted for centuries: Divine commands prove free will; election is unjust; predetermination destroys liberty, etc. I recommend this book to students as practice for refuting logic fallacies and exegetical errors."
5,Danger of Exetreme Calvinism,"This is a must read for all church history buffs and those that love the gospel and love the foundation of Jesus Christ. Jesus told us to go into all the world and preach the gospel. We were not told to set up Christian dictatorships and communities that controlled people's lives and practiced forced conversions to any religion even Christianity. We are to preach the gospel that causes one's life to change and become in the image of Christ. This book points out the error of Calvinism and John Calvin who had a man burned to the stake for disagreeing with the Calvinist doctrine. It is an eye opener and a reminder that we are to do all things with love, not cruelty. We have enough cruel religions, we need to be different than the world around us imitating Jesus Christ Himself."
3,Interesting,I purchased this book as I was planning a trip to the area and wanted to get a feel for it before I left. I like history and it was very warmly written and I mentioned it to a friend who is tired of living in the city.
3,yes,this is a cheapo made in china ford keychain. i was looking for something american made and that would reflect the quality of my ford product. this was not it. i am dissapointed in amazon.
3,JVC MG77U Camcorder,"This camcorder is great, however it only has a 10X optical lens whereas even their less expensive camcorders have at least a 30X optical lens.Our camcorder was missing the lithium battery and the lens cover didn't fit and the JVC factory refused to do anything about it. They suggested I call the dealer to see if anything could be resolved, but we ordered it online and it's difficult to get repairs/replacements such as this.When buying one of these camcorders, be certain that it contains a U after the product model, since I believe the ""U"" refers to United States."
2,I'd rather forget this experience.,This book was sub par and did not capture the mood of the old man. I would not recommend this book.
3,For appearances only,"Soft, cuddly, cute shark plush... But the stitching isn't very strong. After only a few days of squishing, several spots along the seams needed repaired. Not sure it would put up with the kind of abuse a child could subject it to. Perhaps something more suitable for decorative use."
4,A good yarn with some interesting twists in the cryptogram.,"As usual, Jules Verne writes a good yarn. This one is about a successful Portugese man who is wrongly accused and convicted in the far reaches of the Amazon basin. He is eventually saved by the solution of an encrypted confession by the man who committed the crimes. I found the challenge of solving the cryptogram before I got to the ""book solution"" to be trickier than expected. The type of cryptogram is pretty easy to determine; but getting a complete solution means overcoming three unexpected hurdles, two of which aren't even mentioned in the book."
4,My most bought camera,"This camera is pretty good for any person. I was trying photo art with it and it's not excelent for that... but for memory photos is great.I had another like this one but with 6.5 MP, then I bought this one.. then I bouth another one like this for a friend. Now i'm saving money to buy another one, because a couple of days ago i lost this one i bought :(I think this is the best option because of the price, and because is a really good product. I love taking pictures, i love images, i love memories, i love visual art.. and this is the perfect tool."
4,"Beep, Beep, Beep...","KEEP YOUR BOX & RECEIPT! After 200+ pics my lens got stuck! Samsung online service was fast & easy, don't bother with the retailer or their service plans, you've got 1yr from purchase - labor & return shipping. they want you to insure & ship by UPS, but I just threw a priority mail stamp on it!"
3,not the muse we all know. but actually a fine cd.,"especially the song STAR. i get this cd very cheap from a used store and finding it not to be the Muse that put out Absolution, I almost disposed of it. But i gave it a listen, and it has some ok songs. the main singers voice is really good too. ""3 Stars"""
3,Not as good as the manga,This came on time and in great condition. I don't like the way this ends and it changes things from the manga but it still is a cute anime.
4,Nice little camcorder,"I like this camcorder because it is small, lightweight and travels easily. Neat little feature- you can take snapshots while recording video. I'm very happy with the optical zoom. The only downfall- no separate charger for the battery so the camera has to be plugged in to charge it, which is very limiting. On the upside- it charges quickly."
3,Amish Barns not about barns,"I bought this book at a gift for Valentine's Day, thinking it would show many Amish barns, their construction and variety. Instead, the book is a history of a few foundation Amish families, their homesteads and geneology. It was not a successful gift, alas."
2,No thanks.,"I was really dissapointed with this. When the case is on, it's nearly impossible to get the memory card in and out. It leaves too much space between itself and the player, making it possible for dust and particles to slip in. I was constantly trying to take it off to clean due to this, but the case was also extremely hard to remove."
3,works good enough,the only thing wrong with this item is that the threaded part that connects the clear case to the belt clip are molded and too loose. the clip tang threads onto the clear case with an opposing nut. it's easy to strip it and make them unusable. use some thin cloth tape to make the threads bite again and it works great. the clear case is a perfect fit and allows access to all ports. great item for the price. get something better if you want to pay more.
4,Not great.,"The case does real well protecting the mp3 player, but it leaves much to be desired. Once the case is on it's very difficult to get back off. I had to pry it open with a knife, which is very hard to do without damaging the sansa or the case itself. The belt clip is rather flimsy, so I don't use it at all. While the sansa is cradled perfectly inside so there's no bouncing, there is plenty of room for a lot of dust to get in, making the mp3 player look dirty and dusty, which drives me crazy. Otherwise the case is fine. It doesn't add too much bulk to the player like other cases do. Overall 3 stars, because of the difficulty of removing the case without damaging the sansa and the ability for so much dust to get in."
4,What You See Is What You Get,This gate is wonderful. I loved that my son would still be able to see me through the gate as though it wasn't there. The only thing I was a little dissapointed about was the fact that you need to have a relatively large door in order for the gate to be able to swing open and walk through.
4,Wonderful gate for the money,"I bought 3 of these gates for my home daycare and love them. They were very easy to install and seem to be very durable. I would agree that I would not use the pressure mount as that is how I had them set up to begin with and I was very unhappy because they were not that easy to put up and take down on a regular basis. I think that for the price they are one of the best wall mounted gates on the market. The gates are also extra wide so they fit larger than normal doorways without having to buy an extension piece. If you have a climber as I do, they can get over them as with any gate of this height but it does not pull out of the wall or open by its self while he is doing so. The gates are very sturdy and I am going out today to buy a fourth for the top of my stairs."
3,"Good gate, but has downsides","Bought this gate as a replacement for ours, the wall brackets broke. I thought this would be great because you can see right through it. While that is a nice feature, it does eliminate the support bar across the middle of the gate and this seems much more unstable and wobbly than our last one did. One nice thing is that this is a taller gate, which is quite helpful with a tall child! It also has snap width adjusters rather than having the old fashion screws like our old one did, which is nice. Overall it is not a bad gate, but I would not suggest using it at the top of stairs. Other than the questionable stability it is a nice gate and the handle is very easy to operate."
3,Warning: NOT pressure-mounted,"Unlike some other models (like the hands-free gates), you'll need to bolt this to the wall. Otherwise, it's a barrier, not a gate: it won't open."
4,All Clear Swing Gate,"I installed the gate at the top of my stair case (using the hardware mounts, not the pressure mount system). The installation was quick and easy. The gate operates with similar ease. The clear plastic makes the gate more aesthecially pleasing than most other gates and so far seems very sturdy. For the price, this item can't be beat."
3,Good condition,Book was missing the entire test review for the finals but it was in good condition. Was told it wasn't missing pages
2,Could be better,"I used this book as a primary text for inspection training, and it does an adequate job of explaining the information. However, it does not quite explain the material as well as some of the other books on the market. Now, if this is your primary text for GD&T application from a design standpoint, immediately file this one in the nearest garbage can and consider: Dimensioning & Tolerancing Handbook by Drake (probably the one to get if you only get one text because it is very comprehensive...even includes stack-up calculations), GD&T Fundamentals by Krulikowski, or Design Dimensioning and Tolerancing by Wilson (this one and the one by Drake are really done with the design application in mind). Bear in mind that the previous texts and the one under review all reference the 1994 revision of the standard (which should be fine because the vast majority of industry has largely ignored the 2009 revision...to date)."
4,Live in London great CD,"I am currently listening to this album as I am writing this all I can say this is a wonderful album.I own the Album version of this but it doesn't compare with the digital re mastered CD version its so clean and clear and when playing it I actually feel like I am in the audience.Listening to Bluebird live is just so much better than the single version and that last note she holds is 100% Diva material.Also I love ""Candle On the water"" both the live and studio recordings of this songs gets to me every time the lyrics are so beautiful and powerful.""Poor little fool"" from this Album should have been released as the single why it wasn't I will never know this arrangement is powerhouse and 100% top 40 material for its time a hit lost forever.If you are a Helen Reddy fan you owe it to yourself to get this CD and spend a Evening with Helen and when the show is over you don' t have to worry about leaving the theatre and drive home just turn the player off ;o)"
4,Some nutty fun.,"Kind of like Caddy Shack meets Animal House, but on a lower budget. Very pretty girls. Fun to watch if not taken too seriously."
4,Lots of Laughs,"OK, so I didn't learn anything about golf from watching this DVD.....but it was a pleasure to see Amy Lynn and the other girls washing all of those golf carts....lots of suds and skin!"
1,This movie wasn't funny,"I bought this movie based on the other reviews but apparently they have different tastes than I do. I sat bored to death through the show and my brother got up and left. It's because the actors were not natural, they appeared to be trying really hard to act stupid and sounded like they were reading cue cards. The T & A was mundane too, something like teens might want to see. The only way a person could enjoy this movie is to be so drunk they don't know what's going on, since I don't drink I didn't enjoy it. I would have given it about minus 10 stars but there was no setting to choose that. Save your money and buy something funny made by the National Lampoon guys or some other tried and tested studio."
4,Great anamation,"A great movie. I was not familiar with the comic book series so I watched this movie with no pre-conceived ideas. The only dissapointing part of this dvd is that you must flip it over half way through the movie. It could have easily fit on one side in a dual layer format. Boo, hiss. END"
2,oh crap i got excited for nothing i had no idea it was editited,i taught i was receiving the uneditied version longer one i noticed it's only 90 minutes n skips a few episodes darn
5,A Wonderful Journey,"I have been a Peter Murphy fan for a long time and have always considered him to be my favorite artist of all time. ""Deep"" was at the top of my list till I acquired ""Cascade"". It further solidified why I enjoy this man's music so much. The CD opens with two of strongest tracks in ""Mirror to my woman's mind"" and the infectious ""Subway"". ""I fall with your knife"" may be Peter Murphy's best song to date as it stirs your insides with his strong vocals. The CD closes with the hauntingly powerful ""Cascade"" which whisks you away to another place. I am in total agreement with a previous reviewer...play it loud!! If your new to Peter Murphy, get Cascade. You won't be sorry."
2,A remarkable story told poorly to an American audience,"Curran writes to a distinctly British audience. I found his use of the laguage confusing and it detracted from what was an interesting story. For people interested in learning about high altitude mountaineering is it educational, but not very fun to read."
1,"Very poor product, very poor quality","Please do not waste your family's hard earned money on this product. The finish was terrible and the fits when assembled were worse. I did not expect much for the price; however, I have bought much more inexpensive type products that were far superior. If you need something that looks terrible to store a few items in a dusty dark garage then it might serve a use. If you actually want something for inside your house go somewhere else. We have furnished our entire living room with inexpensive items (IKEA) that looks great and is functional. This was actually the most expensive piece we bought and just can't express how bad it is."
2,"Yup, cheap.. cheap cheap cheap...","What can you say. When you look for the cheapest linen chest on the internet, that's exactly what you're going to find. This Ikea-style piece of furniture is pretty much what you would expect. Don't order it if you don't already have experience putting cheap furniture together, the instructions are NOT very helpful and you'll be going by instinct most of the time. Screwing-in the top is especially hard (the screwdriver that comes with it is useless) and when you're done, it doesn't actually close all the way :(But hey. It's just a chest. you can put stuff in it, it doesn't look half bad.. but they could really do a lot better if they just give you better instruction, and work out a better way to close the top."
1,reiki first aid,too much work if your not serious about it-and it really requires a lot of practice-and its small print so its hard to read
3,Flashback to 90's!,"Soundtrack is ok, not quite as good as I'd hoped for. Tool song is from opiate EP and Sugar Ray song is from Lemonade & Brownies album."
2,Two minutes long? Clarification requested.,"This is really more a question than a review as I have not seen the product and I don't think I will based on the information in the product listing.The description says: ""ONE AND ONLY (unauthorized)is an excellent new documentary about Adele and contains everything you need to know about Adele, the new star in music business.""The product details also list the running time as 2 minutes. I'm certain that I'd be interested in knowing more information about Adele than could be presented in two minutes.Update 2/8/13: I see that at some point they finally corrected the running time to 44 minutes. Still, we don't see that many people have viewed and reviewed this, so I'm still not inclined to take a chance, though I'm sure it would be interesting to know more about her life."
4,The soundtrack to your next coke and whores party.,"Though I like their earlier stuff more, this is a solid release from them, and ""13 Above The Night"" is liked the most by some fans. Roughly fitting into the techno-industrial genre, this album is full of distorted vocals, driving beats, horns, sex/drug lyrics, and anything else you can imagine. Plus you can dance to it. More like Lords Of Acid than Skinny Puppy. Each of their albums are different, but this one pleases like any of the others. It's perfect for a ""Disko Fleshpot"" who's ready to live the ""Badlife""."
4,"Once you get started, you won't want to stop.","I really enjoyed this book. If you like mysteries then you'll love this book. Anneke, Zoe, and Clare make a great team. This book really draws you in from page one."
5,Smokin' Hot,"This book is one very hot read. All three stories in this book are awesome. Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. You will not be disappointed with this book. The authors are a must buy for me now."
3,Not bad but not great.,"Too much happening, you get used to one story then it moves on to another story, sometimes the stories are a tad boring and take up the whole 45 mins.Great acting interesting but a bit slow.Thanks"
2,not that great,This is a pretty bad commentary on Jonah. There are few good insights and the prose is laborious and a really boring read. A better commentary (if you can stomach the maddening transliterations of the Hebrew) is Jack Sasson's commentary.
5,Our favorite rice for Chinese cooking,"We were introduced to this brand of rice by our long-time favorite sushi chef. I don't make sushi often, but it's our go-to brand for all our Asian meals."
4,Fine Soul,"Cindy is a very well known backing singer. This is to my knowledge her only solo CD. She has a strong voice and the songs are good and fine soul. ""Smile"" is a duet with Gerald Levert. It's a good buy, but rare to get"
2,Doesn't work for me...,"Gary Smalley seems to take the position that if you make a woman the center of your universe, everything will work out right. Lists and lists of all the things the husband should try to remember to do (fine if you have no job or other commitments). His position seems to be that if the husband does ALL the right things for LONG enough, the woman will respond like a puppy dog. I'm sorry, women were born into sin just like men and can be just as rebellious and obstinate as men can. A marriage is a relationship between TWO people and is only as CHRISTIAN as the two individuals in the marriage choose to be."
5,Excellent Book- Love those wives! Eph 5:25,"I have not finished it yet, but so much good schtuff. Be ENCOURAGED!Pray! Work, Pray!Remember to pick this up and re-read it yearly if not more often!Your Marriage IS savable. Do NOT give-up like the rest of the world.Have FAITH and BELIEVE!!Blessings all,Eric"
3,women beware,"When I bought this book for my husband one year ago, we were in serious trouble. I bought the book for him as a gift hoping to inspire him to try to pay attention to me. Mostly he laughed it off and put in under the bed to gather dust. Most of what Mr.Smalley writes about what women need is really well put.He also describes a womens needs and if they are not met, well. However, if you, (a woman) reads this book and your mate does nothing and disrespects you even further, you are most basically dealing with a man who is insensitive and disrespectful, and you are probably being verbally, physiclly or emotionally abused or all three. Contact your nearest womens' shelter for more information. My husband is now my EX."
5,If he only knew,It's an awsome book It has helped me understand my marrige and with my kids sooo much every man should read this book
5,"Bought Mine in 1991, Still Going Strong","My everyday beside alarm for 20+ years. Mine might be the earlier FS-5000 but clearly it's the same system. Wakes me to my radio station unfailingly. Excellent sound quality particularly for classical and similar music. I'm finally going to look for a replacement because at long last the display is starting to fade out, and the lack of USB/iPod connections (not needed in 1992!) is starting to pinch. JVC = Quality!"
2,not great,"I've had the FS-7000 for a few months now, and it especially bothers me that there is no balance control, b/c I don't have room for speakers on one side of my TV. I didn't find out until it was too late though."
5,Highly Entertaining,Reads like a funny novel but jam-packed with lots of useful advice for writers and today's generation of industry people. A great behind-the-scenes peek at the olden' days and lots of old characters. If you like Rege' then you'll love this book. I did.
2,An extremely biased account,"Stonewall Jackson at Cedar Mountain is an aptly named book. Krick focuses the majority of his efforts on the Confederate high command at Cedar Mountain, and when Union actors are introduced they are a portrayed as simple buffoons and not the complicated, yet flawed individuals that they really were. In addition the vast majority of the sources the Krick uses are post war memoirs that are filled with Lost Cause memory. I was looking for a well researched book on the battle, which I have walked over many a time, however it has yet to be written. I for one can not wait for a book that will objectively look at Jackson's actions in a battle that he almost lost."
1,Disappointed,"We bought the watch for our 8-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. It ran for about a month then stopped. I tried a new battery twice new but no luck. Cute wristbands, nice concept but the watch itself doesn't make the grade."
1,Lousy!,"Second hand fell off before my daughter ever got to wear it. It's cute, but no good if it doesn't work!"
3,Wont keep the right time,I bought this for my 8 yeat old to help her to keep reading time. The watck works for a few hours then no longer keeps time with the other clocks.Overall a very cute watch just for her to dress up in
2,Not worth buying,This movie has a decent creep factor for your average slumber party of 13 year old girls who want to scream and tell scary stories. No violence or anything just the average current ghost cliches. I'm glad I watched it for free on Amazon Prime because I wouldn't have wanted to pay it!
1,Not what it looks like,The preview looked promising but the movie was a let down. Bad acting and terrible story line. This is a waste of money.
3,Ok..,Movie was a little scary but not really worth paying for it. I say dont waste your money ... ..
2,Wouldnt watch again,"Watched the trailer, and my expetations were high considering the other documentary style thriller movies that are currently out, however, this one fell short. Only 2 scenes in this movie that lived up to being a thriller movie and that was it. Even with the lag of time between scenes it wasn't worth waiting for the conclusion of the movie. Poor."
4,Apartment 143,143 doesn't mean Iove you in this case. This is a very busy flick. There's a lot going on here. You have to pay close attention otherwise the movie won't make much sense. I'm not going to give a snopysis like some other people do. By the time they're finished you might as well not watch the movie. I recommend this if you like a good scare. It may be a little unsettlelnig to some.
4,very good sound for the price,"I didn't expect a whole lot when I installed these outside, but was pleasantly surprised. They have a much better bass response than I expected. Certainly not great stereo sound, but for the price, they are certainly worth the money. Very satisfied."
5,Great sound at a great price,"impressive sound in a small speaker.The ""housing"" look real enough and the price was great"
2,After years of trying to finish...,"I've picked this book up multiple times the past couple of years and somehow could NEVER get past the third chapter. I'm not sure if I was just very determined this time, but I was shocked to discover that the book is sectioned into three parts. If you can get past the first section (Queen of Hearts) the last two are more entertaining. I found myself actually wanting to find out the mystery behind Terra Viridian's Visions. There isn't really a payoff at the end and a relationship between two characters is never fully explored. I guess since this book is such a departure from her usual fare, it's worth a glance for the curious. But truthfully it has put me in the mood to read Stephen R. Donaldson's Gap Cycle again."
4,Great value!,Clear optics to the edges all the way around the lens> Great light gathering in low light ....dawn and dusk. Have had mine for 3 Wi deer seasons and temps from 45 deg and fog to -5deg.No fogging and it stays on target from yr to yr. I shoot to make sure it is still on and just because I like to. It is certainly not a Nikon or Leupold but doesn't pretend to be though it holds it own just fine. LIfetime warranty is good insurance as well. I paid alomst $100 3ys ago so this price is a steal. I also have a Leopold 3x9 50mm and a n upper end Bushnell and this is a great buy! IF I had another rifle I would get another Alpine....especially at this price.
3,"Like a Cosmo quiz, writ large","Not a bad little book ... it even asked some questions we hadn't thought to discuss. But on the whole, this book is rather shallow and only really touches on things in a superficial way. An excellent start, but if it goes well another more serious book would be a good followup."
4,THE SWEDE RISBERG STORY,"After the Black Sox: The Swede Risberg StoryI HAVE READ AND RE-READ THE SWEDE RISBERG STORY. I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT AND THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE INFORMATION THE AUTHOR WAS ABLE TO FIND. UPON READING THE BOOK I WAS ENGULFED IN THE NOSTALGIA OF THE TIME. BASEBALL WAS INDEED A PART OF THIS NATIONS GROWTH, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AMERICA. MY FAMILY WAS A PART OF THAT TIME AND INTEREST IN THE GAME STILL PERSISTS. THIS BOOK WAS JUST EXACTLY THE KIND OF INFORMATION I NEED."
3,a baseball historian's dream,"This book is of interest to those true baseball fans who understand that the interest in baseball in the 20's was so much different than it is today. Men played for the love of the game, even in sand lot leagues. Towns fielded their own teams, and locals went to see the games. This is a book that will show that deep interest that towns had for these teams.It doesn't dwell on the scandal, but more on the itinerant life of a ball player of that time.My personal interest comes from living in the town where Swede passed away, although i never knew him. I did visit another town where he lived and talked to oldtimers who knew him well -- what an amazing history to be able to revisit. One of the greatest sports books ever written is "" The Glory of Their Times"" by Lawrence (sp.?) Ritter- I read this when I was about 12 years old - I loved the spirit of the oldtime ball players. This book is a great history of the early days of baseball !"
2,"Average, not that hot","The scenes in GGW: Girl Power vol.2 are average make out scenes. There is a good club scene with two women having lots of fun. But other than that, many of the scenes are edited short where you do not see all of the girl power action."
1,"A good item for middle-aged, stoned people or second year art students","This thing is way too long and renders an interesting artist boring.Far too self-involved and masterbatory. I actually liked A.G.'s work before I saw this movie. Now? Not so much. I just can't deal with people who take themselves that seriously, especially a guy who spends all day arranging twigs.The attempt at creating drama out of a dude stacking rocks is rediculous at best.Just stick to the picture books if you want to continue enjoying this artist."
2,Horrendous DVD transfer,"I must agree with one of the previous reviewers. I love the film but the quality of the DVD transfer is terrible. The picture itself is widescreen, but they transferred it in 4:3 format. So if you have a normal 4:3 tv you'll get black bars on top and bottem. If your tv is widescreen, as mine, then you'll get black bars on the sides as well. What kind of moron did they hire to do the DVD transfer?"
5,Inspiring,"Seeing one of Andy's pieces of art is impressive enough, but getting to know the story behind these temporary works of art, having some insight into his thinking and learning how these very different pieces fit together leaves me even more impressed. A must see."
5,Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers & Tides DVD,"Love this film. Rarely do I purchase movies, but this is a must have. Through Andy's vision and creativity, we are reminded that reconnecting with nature is primal food for the soul. Joy in the process, the exchange, the present moment, is what matters. Essential viewing for the artist, the lover of nature, and anyone wishing to be wowed."
4,Engaging portrait of a remarkable artist,"A very engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland."
3,An OK come back,"Not what I excepted especially from E. Lynn. Compared to all the rest of his novels this is sub par work. We debate the Bible all the time but those of us who read it on a regular basis no matter what version, know what it clearly states. This book was more about dislike toward a kind of people who chose to be the way they are."
3,Don't Expect a Lot,"I went in to this latest E. Lynn release with no expectations and I'm glad I didn't. I sort of left his books after his third book and returning with ""I Say a Little Prayer"" was a flat liner to me. The story of Chauncey and Damien having childhood experiences in their boy band ""Reunion"" and that being the foundation of the story was weak. Then as we move into present day - the lead character seemed indecisive and overly eager to find romance in his male suitors. The plots of the revival, day of absence walkout and choice to out Rev. Upchurch was dumbed down in the end. There was no real closure or climax to the story. This book was a light, easy read but I didn't grow attached to any of the characters."
3,Needed a Little More,"I enjoy E Lynn Harris and usually find that his novels have a refreshing mix of seduction and scandal with humor and (albeit a bit fantastic) plot. I Say A Little Prayer introduces some characters with great potential, but it read more like a series of introductory character sketches than a finished novel on par with Lynn's other works. I recommend it because it is a quick and easy read, and I'm hoping that the books to follow in this new series give us more of what we've become accustomed to from Lynn."
3,Propaganda,"I have never experienced propaganda as I did with this book. It felt like a big reading advertisement as to why it's okay to troll gay parties looking for anonymous sex partners and then get up to go worship the next morning.I have read every E. Lynn Harris book written and have enjoyed his stories because it wasn't trying to sell me on something being right or wrong. In this book, I felt a need to defend the faith.My fan days are over, I guess."
4,E. Lynn Harris....,"I had this book for about a year before I finally picked it up and read it this weekend. I have to say that it was a nice read. Was not crazy about the plot twist. I loved the Basil update. Always need that... This book was not E. Lynn's best, but it was still nice to ""see"" new characters and touch base with the old."
3,Very good Synopsis,"I've known Shane and Carl since we were activists in the early eighties. This is their best work to date. As we are in the midst of real upheaval and uncertainty in our political climate, where we could lose much of what we've gained, the time is right for this book. Read it, now more than ever. We can fight or we can get along. The book has many answers!"
4,Great sharpening system for beginners,"I have to be honest, it took me a while to get the hang of sharpening the Henckels in my kitchen. First it was difficult for me to figure out how to sharpen the knives with little ridges and I ended up sharpening on one side only without them. Then I had to correct myself whenever I had the angle wrong. Also there is a movement of the knife on the stone that allows for the most efficient and sharp product. This also was something that I had to get used to.But by the end, I had the whole process down in my arm and I sharpened the knives to my preference. They are so sharp now that I started getting cuts in my fingers (another habit I have to watch out for.Overall, I'm very happy with the product and the price."
4,Good little sharpener,"Good little sharpener for the money. Only issue I have had and I've seen other say the same thing, is that the Medium stone is definitely smoother than the Fine. I just finish with the medium instead of the fine, not a huge deal. Also if you have a good size collection of knives to sharpen, order an extra bottle of the honing oil, as the one it comes with wont last that long."
4,Fine stone came unglued after 15 years,Otherwise it works just fine. My coarse stone is getting worn out. I would get a diamond one next time if I could afford it.
4,Sharpening system,"Very nice product, easy to use and clean up. What a nice difference to be able to sharpen my own knives!"
4,Description is misleading but a good product,"While it is a ""TRI-6 Arkansas Tri-Hone SYSTEM"" they are not all 3 ARK stones. Two are synthetic and the fine one is a genuine ARK stone. I thought that was a little inexpensive for 3 stones. They should make the description a little better. IT is misleading. I do like the system though."
2,Don't use with single bevel knife,Don't buy this if you are planning on sharpening a single bevel knife. It will actually blunt it.
4,"Very good, just needs some base stability","For the price its great, just a little light weight. put a damp cloth under it and it holds great. great for all kinds of knives and sharpens to a darn sharp edge."
3,OK,"I am semi-pleased but cannot in good faith give it a huge star rating... it seemed to help my knives somewhat, but they never sharpen as sharp as I want. This could be the knife, me, or the hone.... I am unsure..."
5,A helpful supplement for your dog,"Some dogs have anxiety issues triggered by various events or situations. I'm not sure how Cholodin works, but it definitely has a calming effect on dogs, and seems to alleviate some dementia in older dogs. We've had good results with it."
3,Martin Nylon Uke Strings,"Reasonable tone & durability, particularly in light of their budget price. They string an old Taiwanese laminate I leave in the corner for a quick strum."
1,Better to get the cheap crap,"Thought I would upgrade and get Martins. I have a half a dozen ukes of varying sizes and styles. Purchased 2 sets.Total crap. Buzzing, breaking. The two sets lasted a total of 17 days. Total waste of money.Went down to the local store and got some cheap plastic crap. Have had those on the big banjolele now for 3 months with no trouble at all. Will stick to those."
1,No longer best in the wold,"Somewhat disappointed with the new Riedel Sommeliers Burgundy Grand Cru, Single Stem.I believe quality has dropped a lot from the legendary Riedel manufacture.This is not the first time that I am replacing single stem of the Riedel product.The original was purchased about five years ago and they were perfect. I bought them right here at Amazon.The new one is not as tall as the original and has some imperfections in the bottom of the glass. I am not sure how this high-end wine glass pass their quality control. Perhaps, it is no longer available.I for one will look for alternative next time around."
4,Dilla shoulda produced more tracks,"Though I was quite impressed w/ Commons latest release, Im dissappointed Jay Dee didnt produce more tracks. As gifted a producer K. West is....I find myself getting bored with his endless samples, and recycled kicks and snares. Dont get me wrong...son is ill, but Jay Dee should have handled more production. Also...after listening to Common for about 10 years now, I'd like him to SWITCH UP HIS FLOW !!! I love and respect Common as an emcee, and he can get on ANY track/beat and rip it, but its the same flow with the same infamous 2 to 3 second pause every 8 bars or so. Depsite my sea of negative comments, I love this album and it is worth the purchase."
3,hypo allergenic,"kanye west takes the prize on this. production great, words ok. a bit dissapointed in the flow. can't someone write some original lyrics? we need a little sun ra with our bacon and eggs."
4,modern tech features,"I'm used to anything Mac being on the high side price wise, so I'm also glad that the price is lower. I was having trouble getting a 3GP phone converter software and was surprised that this mac software has the feature. My phone plan doesn't include video and photo mailings so it gets pricey too for sending media. I can manipulate the video files much better with Popcorn and then use my phone as a viewer. When my contract expires I'm going to change plans, but I know I could still use the disc copy, dvd compression, iPod converter features. Good deal."
5,"Spoken Softly, Hard Hitting","Less an autobiography and more a series of reflections, philosophies, and anecdotes, I'd Hate Myself In The Morning is a slender but superb work by one of the most underrated writers America has ever produced. I say underrated because he was not only competing with the legacy of his famous father, but also because of his experiences with the blacklist and his subsequent emergence from that period, all of which Lardner discusses with a candor that is very engaging, honest, and thought-provoking. In noting that he passed away shortly after the book was published, it casts a very eerie, but not creepy, shadow over the last chapter in which he discusses his views on mortality and death. A very quick read and well worth it."
3,more expensive than Stigma from sports authority.....same thickness 3/4',i found that this butterfly table seems more expensive than Stigma from sports authority.....for the same thickness 3/4'
4,"Make sure this is the ""Broken Lullaby"" you really want!","The original ""Broken Lullaby"" was produced in 1932 and is a story of redemption and forgiveness through love (in my opinion). It is one of the most powerful anti-war movie you will ever experience and is a must-see for all serious movie-goers."
4,Better than expected,"I've had this movie for some time but kept putting off watching it because I didn't expect it to be so great because of the cast--not my favorite actors. I finally watched it and was very entertained by it. What was interesting was watching the changes in some of the characters, especially Mona's husband. The undertaker was hilarious, particularly his joke about ""everyone and their mothers"" betting on the game."
5,Casey deserves an OSCAR,"Note to agent: the kid is funny. The whole movie deserves to be watched as a monthly ritual. Every part was perfectly cast, and the movie is never slow... always entertaining to me and I'm the girl who loves Jane Austen novels, period pieces and any informative documentary over 2 hours. Ang Lee as well!For some reason this movie just sticks with me. Will Farrell's little twisted role is a huge reason- but it's just something else that makes me pi$$ myself- maybe the Yugo's? I dunno, I try not to analyse it much more than this movie deserves to be in your collection. Oh, as does Detroit Rock City."
4,Fine entertainment,"While not a masterpiece, this movie provides good, solid entertainment. The director's commentary is ver enjoyable addition to this film."
1,Yugo the Only Winner,"The story line of this movie is interesting enough, but the writing and the performance of the actors is anything but stellar. The big names chosen for this movie (DeVito, Midler, Curtiss) are not enough to keep ""Drowning Mona"" from drowning. The only winner in this movie seems to be the Yugo automobile makers who seem to have created a movie-length advertisement. With only a rare exception EVERYONE in town drives a Yugo. Save your money, don't buy this movie. Rent it only if you are planning on running it for background noise--you won't miss anything by not watching it. Just like most Americans missed nothing by passing up that opportunity to purchase a Yugo from the local dealer."
2,Wasted Talent,"I watched this movie because the cast included Bette Midler, Danny DeVito and Jamie Lee Curtis. I thought: ""This must be really funny."" Wrong. This film is full of adolescent, predictable humor held together with the thread of a mystery: Who killed Mona?. By the end of this movie, the hackneyed humor and ""obvious"" plot twists lead more to the question of ... Who really cares? The one redeeming feature of the movie is that it contains a large collection of Yugos. So, if you want to feel nostalgic about the Yugo, watch this movie; otherwise, do not let the cast fool you -- skip it."
2,Mildly Amusing...at best.,"A few funny moments throughout an hour and a half don't make a good comedy and that is what we learn after seeing this movie, which contains 80% stupid mindless drivel."
4,I LOVED THIS MOVIE . ...,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!...WHAT A DARK COMEDY... IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OFF KEY . IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LITTLE STUPID . THAT'S THE POINT. THE WHOLE CAST OF THIS MOVIE IS GREAT AND THEY MAKE IT WONDERFUL TO WATCH.
3,It has it's funny parts,"This is a decent film. There are plenty of funny parts.The story is based in a small town in New England, sometime around 1985. Yugo (the car manufacturer) has selected this town as a test bed for their cars.... But that's another story. Everyone in the town has a Yugo.Anyway, Bette Middler is a real pain in the neck of a woman. Everyone hates her, even her family. She's abusive and cruel. So, one day she has a bad accident in a Yugo and is killed. DeVito is the local Chief of Police. He detects foul play immediately.The movie goes from there as each of the possible suspects begin to tell their stories. The reenactments are very funny. Each person remembers the same scene differently.However, I only give it three stars because these actors have some much more skill than the film allows. Either way though, the film is entertaining."
2,The tone didn't hit the right key.,"There were a few funny moments, but nowhere near enough to recommend the film. This was a screenplay in dire need of a rewrite. They either needed to make it darker or lighter; the ""in-between"" tone didn't work at all. I do agree with one of the descriptions in an earlier review regarding Casey Affleck's acting. He annoyed the hell out of me. Jamie Lee Curtis was decent, but Danny Devito looked like he didn't care a whole lot. Bette Midler had some funny moments, but she wasn't in the film much. That, for her career, was a plus."
1,Boring,Bridge of San Luis Rey is a really boring movie. Such an excellent cast is wasted on a slow movie that's an aweful period piece.
1,silly,"this movie was silly, boring and poorly done. The only saving graces were the excellent performance by Robert Deniro playing himself pretending to be Spanish and how admirably it performed as a cure for insomnia. I managed to stay awake through out the entirety of my viewing but only barely. My companions were not as unlucky as I was and dozed periodically only to rouse themselves intermittently to wonder if anything had happened. That's rather a big problem trying to adapt this book; it's not especially action-packed. Honestly, the book is so much better. I'm not sure it's possible to capture its essence to display on screen. It's probably futile to try."
1,Never again!!,This was garbage!! I had it maybe 2 weeks when it just stopped working. I am in IT and a coworker of mine took a look at it also and couldn't do anything. I ended up throwing it away in discuss. I've got Archos products that I've had in excess of 5 years!
1,Horrible zombie short movie. Do not waste your $1.99. So glad I did not buy for $10.,"Based on the review of the 1 person who has left a 5 star review I thought I would watch this movie. Regret it. Thank god it was a short movie 20 minutes. It didn't feel short. It felt long. It was perhaps one of the worst ideas I have ever seen for a zombie movie and I have seen almost all of them. Boring, no emotion, horrible writing, elementary shots, bad acting and even worse makeup. I can see this was made by wannabe movie makers. That is really no excuse for making people think this is a good movie when in it is a bad one. It must be one of their friends trying to help sell this piece of garbage. Two thumbs down and if I could give it a zero stars I would. This makes me want to watch zack snyders dawn of the dead it was so bad. Hope this helps you save your hard earned dollars."
4,"no ""dead ringer"" remake","i find it a little bit of a shame when readers tell you the whole story, i think it's no point since we have matlin's reviews for that already. Most people think this movie is a remake of ""dead ringer"" but it isn't. The only common point is you got Bette playing twin sisters. While ""dead ringer"" is more of a film noir kind of thing, this one is more romantic and sentimental. Saw them both, loved them both. I have to say though that ""dead ringer""'s ending is much more interesting."
4,Great Book - Interesting Perspective,"This is a good book, puts into perspective our relationship with God. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about living a life to the glory of God."
4,Glory and praise to God,It's a good chance to review our heart and mind to see if we live for God or not.May all glory and praise be to our Almighty God.
3,Yanni can do better,"I really enjoy Yanni's music. However, I didn't enjoy this cd very much. There were some good songs on this cd but not enough to make it good. Alot of the songs sound alike. I don't recommend buying this cd unless you are a true fan of Yanni. Yanni's tribute cd is his best work so far. You should check it out."
1,Yanni is an over dramatic Yak!,"Having been raised among artists and vagrants, (my mother being a concert pianist) I know what good music is. This is not good music. This man is a schmuck. It infuriates me how ignorant so much of the buying public is. His music is so sugary and schmoozy it makes me ill. If you people want hear some real music that is on the romantic side, try Chopin or Listz. Forget Yanni, get an education. It will be well worth your while. As for Yanni, if this reviewing system would let me, I'd give him no stars at all."
1,What's up with this?,"Well, this is a big disappointment to me! Where is Yanni's old dramatic & uplifting style? This new album and his past few re-releases of songs that he has already done, have been a big disappointment! I think the mellowness of this new album has something to do with the split up with Linda Evans! He feels sad, so that's all he can compose! Well, I don't plan on buying anymore Yanni albums in the future! It's a waste of money!!!"
1,Not your typical Yanni,"I looked forward to this new release since it had been a while since we'd heard from Yanni. How disappointing! While the instrumentation was good (not up to usual standards, tho) the music was often interrupted with an irritating voice that sounded like a cross between a witch casting a spell and a cat in heat. I want to hear the music, Yannster, not caterwauling!"
3,"Mediocre composition, tends to be forgettable","Don't get me wrong. I am a die hard Yanni fan and have ~ 10 of his CDs, and the LATA/Tribute Video, and have been to his concert twice (with a 3rd time this Novemeber). But I was hugely dissapointed by this album. It sounded like a rehash of his previous albums... where is his originality this time? And after listening to the entire CD multiple times, most of the songs still sound the same (except that African song).... The whole album feels as though it was a rushed product when Yanni joined another company (anyone else noticed the influx of old Yanni music by his old company whenever his new music are coming out now on the new company)? This album is my least favorite of all Yanni CDs. Get LATA if you are new to Yanni. That one is phenominal."
2,not good,This story was bnizzare and felt like it was on a soap box preaching a political idea. I was not impressed . Vague character descriptions and scenes.
4,A well crafted Romance,"I finished this book like a runaway train. I started to read it at intervals for the first third and gradually slipped into the world built around Kasey and Connie. Then, well, I became part of the audience for what seemed like a live performance.Ms Martin writes beautifully and I easily flowed along with her and the story.The current moves like a gentle river, but beneath the surface a more complex terrain provides the reader a with something more akin to white water.The protagonists are attractive, likeable, and three dimensional. Their conflicted reactions were never artifical and the sudden plot twist shocked me.The romance was genuine and sensual and I can't wait for the sequel, ""Indelible Heart"""
1,"Disappointing, don't bother","I admit I had pretty high expectations for this book after reading some of the reviews, but not even those account for the level of disappointment I had with this book. The characters are two-dimensional and unimaginative, and Ms. Martin provides no motivation for their actions or exploration of their emotions.Also, while I usually commend authors for using current social problems to challenge their characters, there were times when I wasn't sure if I was reading a social commentary or a romance. The subplot involving a hate crime was written particularly unrealistically, ... .Being neither a literary nor a romantic success this book fails to provide an reader satisfaction, and should be avoided at all costs."
5,It took my breath away!,At first the story seems a bit predictable--Kasey and Connie are immediately attracted and will eventually get together and fall in love-right. Not so fast! First they go through some wrenching personal stuff with Connie's Mom. Next they face their own fears and some baggage from the past. Then when they finally do get together they have to deal with all different forms of prejudice on the way to everlasting love. Including tragedy that rocks their world and the fairly closeted gay community in which they live. The story is well written. The characters feel real. It is sometimes sad and at other times laugh out loud funny. I am going to read all of her books now. Don't miss this book.
4,almost no complaints,"This mount seems to fit and work great in my '93 Integra. The only (small) complaint that I have is that it is not entirely clear which way it needs to be mounted. It would be helpful if it had an indicator or a schematic showing which is the top and which is the bottom, since the mount is *almost* symmetric but not perfectly so."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I wanted a book with lot's of color pictures that showed different deck styles and accents so I could design my own custom deck. If your looking for something for design ideas or to show to your contractor, this is the book for you. I also picked up ""A Portfolio of Deck Ideas"" to go with it.If you're after a ""how to"" book, this isn't it."
5,The other side . . .,"In these poems Ward Kelley takes the reader to the other side, into the unknown, into deep corners of the soul. His characters have a transcendental effect of overtaking you, pulling you beyond your existence. What better way to explore your own soul and still be able to learn something about yourself? His stories have a touch of medieval spice along with the contemporary physics of humanity. Each time I listen to Comedy Incarnate, I come away with something new and different. I take something back into my world. The poems stem from tragedies, yet blossom with humility. Kelley is comfortable with the soul and he shows it. This is definitely something special for those of you who study literature or just a special gift to share with others."
5,Someone finally did it!,"This cd is the first of its kind. A patient soundscape that makes all worldly thoughts fall away - leaving you to reaqauint with the real you. This cd implies and encourages health, self-awareness, and honesty. It was made with those intentions and it can help you to find those things in a world that almost prohibits all three. If you practice yoga, meditation or any other breath-conscious art get the whole series of these cds."
1,terrible,i read and then there were none before this book and loved it. this book has nothing that gabs your attention. it doesnt have that wow factor. the method of murder is stupid and it seems that agatha christie wrote this book just to make some money rather than deliver a quality story that had a lot of potential
4,$50 for another year,"Since it doesn't say how much an aditional year cost, I'll say it here: you gotta pay $50 for an aditional year. Unlike Sony, Microsoft does charge every year, but most magazines say that Microsoft's online gaming is better than Sony's. The quantity of games and quality of Microsoft is better than Sony's."
4,accessories for x-box live,"I do not play however, my son is an avid player & I purchase all the games, & equipment that goes along with it. I just wanted to express my concern with the headphone that is with the x-box live. We have had to purchase 2 so far since we went on-line on Christmas. My son is 14 years old & treats this with kit gloves so it is not due to mis handling. He says that no one can hear him when he talks. At this point I am not sure that I would recommend the x-box live to anyone. It has cost me $ 29.99 each purchase of a headset. He is now playing without one. I am a single mother & can't afford to continue buying this headset. Thanks so much for your time.Cathy Smith"
4,Viewsonic projector,I have been using the Viewsonic porjector at work for several years and have found it to be excellent for Powerpoint presentations. I recently developed a need to have my own LCD projector for private work and elected to go with a proven product. I have not been disappointed so far. The product is very reliable and the cost has dropped considerably in the past several years. This is a very competative product.
3,get what you pay for,"This rack is ok I guess. I'm not thrilled with it. It seems to be constructed well and of good materials. It doesn't fit my car with the spoiler/wing very well, but does hold a bike from A to B. There are enough straps, but I had trouble getting the bottom two to hold under all conditions. I found that it was troublesome figuring out a way to not have my pedal banging on the paint of my car. I e-mailed Thule, and this vendor, and they both said all trunk racks have that problem. It would have been nice to know that *before* I bought. Anyway, you can work around it with a bunjee cord, padding, or other tying methods. I have not yet tried to get three bikes on, but don't expect it will be a smooth affair. So, not thrilled, but it's an ok rack."
5,A Grandma's truth,"I had read this book a long time ago when I first became a Grandma. When my sister became a Grandma, I got it for her. Mine is 23 years old and sometimes I look at it for some laughs and also some truths. This is really a cute book and I know anyone who is becoming a Grandma will love it. The title of the book Grandma knows best, but no one ever listens is true sometimes. I like to remind my kids of this but always in good humour. This would be a great Grandma gift at a baby shower."
1,Extremely poor game,"This game have great graphics, and cool character to play with, skeletons or samurai or whatever, it has like 50 card games. But it sucks, i didn't like to play with it, i bought it, but i'm gonna sell it over. Card games needs a screen touch like nintendo DS has."
4,I liked the previous edition better,"I wrote a five star review for the previous edition. I don't think this new edition is as good as the older one because the ""pocket pal"" in the back of the book was eliminated. The pocket pal was a laminated sheet with numbers, foods, and expressions in Spanish and English that one could take out of the back of the book, fold and carry. It was one of the best features of the book. I still think the book is good, and would probably rate it four and a half stars if I could, but I'm very disappointed that they took the pocket pal out. You can buy a separate ""language map"" that looks like the same idea with more phrases than the ""pocket pal,"" but you'd have to order that separately."
4,Pretty good album...,This is one of her better albums in my opinion. Nice edgy and fun alternation- pop type songs. I would recommned this one.
4,"Timeless Humor, But We Can Do Without The PC Police","Here are 38 more Tom and Jerry classic cartoons. It's interesting that on the back of the DVD box, it reads ""is intended for the adult collecctor and may not be suitable for children.""Disc one contains early material. You can tell because they have ""Mammy Two Shoes,"" the maid, in many of them at the beginning. She is a supporting character who's face we never see, and she was fazed out after a few years. The PC Police consider this to be racist, because she's black. A white maid, however, is okay with them. That's the typical Liberal double standard. They even change Mammy's grammar when you use the English subtitles! Puh-leeze!'Anyway, there is enough good material on here to enjoy this collection. These Tom and Jerry cartoons seem timeless. They were good 50 years ago, and still funny today."
3,Warners drops the ball again,"Not only are 4 cartoons using redubbed voices for the maid, but my favorite Saturday Evening Puss is poorly mastered and looks worse than any cartoon on this set. Plus they repeat Texas Tom from Vol. 1. Did nobody involved in this project look at the set list and notice that Texas Tom already came out? And it wasn't even one of the three cartoons snipped on the first set. Expect to see it on Vol. 3."
1,Refuse to Buy!!!!!!!!!!,I refuse to buy... release a true unedited version!!! Enough with the Sensitivity Crap!!!!!
3,Does this have the correct soundtrack?,"Hi all,I am a big fan and watched this completely on a friend's set, but there was a problem with the soundtrack, and Warner had declared they would replace the discs.Now that I am contemplating buying this for myself, can some recent buyer confirm if the problem is fixed?"
1,Depressing,I'm depressed after eagerly waiting a year for this 2nd set. Unfortunately Warner Brothers has let down devoted Tom and Jerry fans for the second year in a row. This collection is a better effort than last year's spotlight collection but the fact of the matter is that not all cartoons in this collection are presented in their original form. One can only hope that WB will correct their errors someday in a future edition or heaven forbid issue a recall considering that this set was advertised as unedited and uncut.
5,Top 5 favorite books of all time,This is easlily one of my favorite books. This book leaves no one unchalenged. No one is let off the hook of living righteously in light of this teaching. From the begining he attacks pride in both the individual believer and also in the broader Church. He painfully points out our areas of lack and apathy and answers those pains with the words of Christ in this sermon. What a blessing to have this book!I am desperately wanting a kindle version of this book.
5,Great,"What can i say, not spectacular acting but still pretty good, main thing was Kenny Rogers, still looks just as good in his 70s."
3,Way too wide. Strong but better options out there.,Yeah it works and it real metal. But its huge. There are smaller options out there that are not plastic and are half the size.
2,Underwhelmed,"This sounds like little more than retro goth pop of the stereotypical kind to my non-fan ears. For such an influential group, I expected something a little more inspired, though I suppose a taut minimalism the band plays out is sufficient enough for merely seeking head-bobbing with a darkened edge."
4,Awesome Single,"I bought Human After All when it first came out, and loved every song.Last week I bought this album and lemme tell you, the two remixes on here are Freakin' Sweet!The Maximum Overdrive is really intense, and the Soulwax Remix is pure Robot gold,showing off everything the song could possibly be.Good Buy if your lookin' for more Robot Rock"
3,For Daft Punk Completists ONLY,"The remixes are good only for those that have a computer to skip the rediculously long, drawn-out, and poorly thought out EP.Maximum overdrive is really more of Daft punk saying ""These are the different vocoder samples we were playing with while making Human After All, all 72 (sic) of them. And now here's the different rhythms and hooks we toyed with but never really made the cut into the album... stuck together.""Soulwax remix is same idea but borrows the slow-to-faster-hokey-pokey used in ""Primetime of Your Life"" and glues on the 2 guitar riffs for 85% of the song. Fantasmic Disaster.Really, if you love Daft Punk soo much that you're a completist (like I am), then you've probably already bought it. But if you can't decide on this EP or the Technologic EP (1st or 2nd), get either of the Technologic EPs. They were much more planned and as a result give a better performance than this whole CD can give you.Oh and check out Vitalic. He rocks Hard just like Daft Punk did."
4,CHURCHILL,"Who knew Winston was such an effective and accomplished author?This is a complete, and I mean complete account and recount (he was there as an Calvary officer) of the life, battles and religious struggles of Sudan and north eastern Africa in the 1800's. He describes the local peoples, their histories and lives, the incursion of Islam, the resultant battles and outside interferences (British, Egyptian...) which plagued, and still plague, this region.Written with period bias and descriptions he effectively draws you into battle after battle in places he so accurately describes that you can smell to rot, hear the shooting and shouting. If you ever wanted to know every detail about long forgotten, although still regionally important, battle scenes: Winstons your guy. Read his other books too."
3,Maps Would Be Helpful,"When I was in college, I got a belated start on a paper on Italian colonialism in Libya. I was so rushed that I neglected to include any maps. For this sloth, the paper was marked down and the professor also jotted down "" some maps would have helpful. "" I had made numerous references to Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, etc. This otherwise fine edition of Winston Churchill's The River War, which seems to have applications to the current wars against Islamic fascism is likewise marred by the lack of maps. Aside from Khartoum and the Darfur region, I admit not being overly familiar with Sudanese geography. Lack of maps on my Kindle edition brought it down to three stars."
5,Love It,"I absolutley love this diaper bag!! It is big enough for a few diapers, an extra change of clothes, two bottles, my wallet, car keys and cell phone. But not too big that it is ""awkward."" Would definately buy again."
2,Worst Atwood Yet,"Atwood is my favorite author. Personally, this novel is her worst - almost as bad as her poetry. Less than half way through, I just didn't care what would happen to the main character and the ending left me without feeling. Atwood has wonderful talent for delving into humanity and psychological realism, but Oryx and Crake was minimal in these areas. She seemed to have left the novel incomplete and without purpose. It has no point and didn't do a good job of having no point! Try Cat's Eye!"
4,Chilling as heck,"So its about a world, where everyone is obsessed with computers and no one really talks to each other except on the internet and everyone is sick because everyone is eating food full of antibiotic's and chemicals and lives in these compounds where the government watch everything and controls everything.This is just he problems for the rich. The poor people live in the polluted earth and are left in a cesspool of danger and disease.Prostitution is rampant.Until a guy gets sick of this crap makes himself god and destroys everything and tries to starts over."
4,Corknut,"I feel ashamed because I had to look up the spelling of dystopian and the tireless Margaret - I have it on good authority - did research out the wazoo, spending several days w/ the real Alex the Parrot (who did not care for how he was portrayed). I hit the Chickie-Nuggets section in the famously healthy (and possibly humorless) Angelica Cafe. I was reminded at times of the tv series Lost (probably because of the weather). And Children of Men (probably because of the Scotch, Clive Owen's and Snowman's, not mine). And my travels in the seamier sections of Bangkok. And the end of Planet of the Apes. Hopefully just a fairy tale, but it had the ring of zombie possibility. Don't forget to pack your sunblock."
2,100 Words or Less,"Atwood creates complicated worlds. When it works, you don't even noticing while accepting the future she builds.But when it doesn't work, as in this novel, nothing holds together. Sections here are so well done, but the connections to other chapters, to the novel as a whole, are missing. Frankly, I think it's due to the length. The novel seems half complete, as if large swaths of details have been glossed over.That's disappointing. It's not bad. It's only half-baked, I think. I suppose that's a weird review: ""I didn't like it because I wanted more."" But there it is."
3,Orys and Crake,"The city I live in had a snow storm around the time I ordered this book, so it took an unusually long time to receive it. But the book was in excellent condition and was a good read."
4,Just Kidding,"The Plot:Jimmy, a man living in a post-apocalyptic world (and who now calls himself 'Snowman'), creates an accidental gospel for a new race of homo sapien like creatures, while tormented by dreams of his childhood, visions of his disappeared mother, and apparitions of a former lover.Atwood's Take:In an interview about this book, Atwood remarked that scientists and novelist are driven by the same question: what if? I am not certain that all novelists would agree with that statement, but it certainly drives this novel. For Atwood, God and science are interchangeable; one happens to be a three letter word, the other a seven letter word- makes no difference.My Take:The sister and daughter of scientists, Atwood's ""gallows humor"" is the main character in this book. She is lying to us. Will you laugh at her joke? Or will you take her tragic nightmare seriously? Or will you do both?I recommend this book."
3,Fragmented and depressing,"This was my second Margaret Atwood following gBlind Assassinh. But in comparison with gBAh, this book was rather disappointing. The author covers many current issues from genetic engineering to child abuse, using a guise of a SciFi fable that is mercilessly pessimistic and unevenly humorous. While the book is filled with imageries that are both powerful and fascinating, somehow it does not all come together. It is like looking at a collage made out of bits and pieces of great artistic works, but it is so fragmented that it does not have a central story to tell."
2,i didnt get the edition it showed on the order form,this book was the right book with the same title and words as the one shown in the picture except it had smaller text and less pages. all the content was there and the book was in good shape but when you are in a class going off of pages to reviewing passages and you have the wrong edition when you ordered the correct edition you get pretty pissed.
5,Composition 2 requirement,It is required for a gen ed courses in college. I have not read it yet so I am not sure what the out come is going to be of the book.
3,"Conclusion, please!","The plot line was intriguing. I found the switching back and forth annoying with too much time spent on Jimmy's childhood and friendship with Crake.I wanted to deeply immersed in the Robinson Crusoe aspect of her story.While no one will regard me as a literary genius is it too much to ask an author to finish the book? Now begins the rolling of eyes by the illuminati...stories, like life never end yada yada. If I have to write my own conclusion I should get a discount on the book. Bah-Humbug!"
2,misled,"This book is NOT Science Fiction and it is NOT even primarily an apocalyptic novel. Stop calling it either. It is most definitely well written, but it is primarily the story of a man looking back at his life and relationship with his best friend and quasi love interest. That is how it should be billed. If scifi or apocalypse stories are what you are looking for, move on. And as to what it actually is, it's still not that good. Great it was written well. The author knows how to put together a sentence and tie together bland storylines. And it succeeds in being really depressing. Sorry I need more than that. The story is boring, the characters are boring, and the setting is boring. Alternately the author gives far too much depth or far too little. I realize I'm in the minority but I have no idea why all of you like this so much. I found this completely unexciting, non-thought-provoking, unemotional, tepid, and unimaginitive. OVERRATED."
1,To Toop first!,"I'd rate this higher just because I find the subject so fascinating were not two very good alternatives available: Richard Toop's ""Gyorgy Ligeti (20th-Century Composers)"" and ""Ligeti In Conversation"". There is no need at all to suffer through ""Gyorgy Ligeti: Contemporary Composer""'s extremely affected and nonsensical mauling of the English language, its banal observations, its specious reasoning."
3,Got what I paid for,"I'm glad I found this book- it got here right on time :) It had some gross stuff on it, though.... that was weird."
2,"GOOD IDEA, DEFECTIVE ASSEMBLE","Pistol-Grip Remote Toe-Nail ClipperGOOD IDEA, POOR DESIGN, POP RIVET POPPED OUT ON 3RD USE. OVWE PRICED`Toe-Nail Clipper Pistol Grip Remote 18"
2,Dissapointed,"I have not yet received this item of purchase and am dissapointed with the time this product is taking to arrive as the final deleivery date is set for the 23/03/11, should this be a cause for concern?"
3,"Despite low quality, still a good value","I picked this up from Amazon for three dollars. Seems like a no-brainer for 45 Bob Marley songs! but keep a few things in mind. If you are looking for a single ""best of"" collection, this is not what you are looking for. Go get ""Legend"". Sure, more money for fewer songs, but it contains the essentials with MUCH higher quality.This collection might be a good 'second' choice. It contains a nice set of great songs with no overlap, but the sound quality really suffers. The master tapes lack and most of the songs are encoded in the 150 kbps (VBR) range. Some songs have some downright nasty compression artifacts. This is really unfortunate.At this price I'd like to give it a 5, but the quality really, really suffers. Still if you want a bunch of Marley to use as background music for a party... I bought it."
5,"different, innocent, inspiring, wonderful","When I read this book, I couldn't believe how simple but how moving it was. One of the lines that really sticks with me is "" I remember James Dean in his red nylon jacket."" Funny, sad, wonderful prose reminicent of the Beat authors."
1,Falsely labeled,"Be careful! This audio book is actually in MP3 format, not CD-ROM. I ordered and returned it twice. I am not sure what is more irritating, the false labeling or Amazon's unwillingness to ship the advertised product."
2,Incredible errors ruin a good idea for an interesting book,"I had looked forward to the arrival of this book for several months. On examination it has so many major factual errors that it cannot be taken seriously even as light reading. I simply cannot understand how a book this shoddy could be published. The erroneous information is easily researchable in many reference texts and on the internet. The author, editor and publisher should be ashamed of this substandard publication."
3,Bandaid fixes??,"Replacing the board is a good idea and can be helpful in some cases, however, in many cases and particularly with a well entrenched board and its allied management company, it is only a bandaid fix for the deep wounds of CID living.In addition to reading this book, it would be good to follow up with, Villa Appalling! Destroying the Myth of Affordable Community Living, written by Donie Vanitzian and Stephen Glassman."
2,Lots of good stories but not real pithy.,"This book is a good source for general stories about homeowner association nightmares. If you haven't already purchased a home having a homeowner's association this would be a good book.The commentary supplementing these stories are mainly exhortations for developers, lawyers, and boards to be reasonable. This theme too often repeats itself throughout the book rather than offering more insight into how to handle the specifics of solving these problems."
1,It's no good without the cassette tapes,"The authors state that the book is designed to be used with their cassette tapes which correspond to each lesson, or with the assistance of a Turkish speaking teacher. IT DOESN'T COME FROM AMAZON WITH THE TAPES! If you had a Turkish speaking teacher, you could use any of a dozen other texts. So, until Amazon starts sending the tapes with the book, don't waste your money on this book."
1,HUH???!!!,The ring and the description DO NOT MATCH!!!The diamonds do not go all the way around. DO NOT BUY this ring! I could have bought this ring at any local discount store. Don't waste your money
2,Disappointing,"My two-year-old barely looked at this book. She loves lift-the-flap books and loves Pooh, but we found the flaps to be very boring. The book has over 60 flaps, but they reveal nothing interesting. Honey pot standing up becomes honey pot tipped over. Pooh smiling becomes Pooh with no expression. Snoozeville. If I had looked at it in a store, I would never have bought it. I highly recommend instead ""Arthur Goes to School""."
5,A lesson for all ages - what a wonderful story!!!,"From the moment we ordered this book my kids waited daily for its arrival. We received it today and read it the minute we walked in the door from school! What a touching story and such an easy, wonderful read. Alex is an amazing young lady who can teach us all a thing or two about selflessness and making a difference in the world. This book will make for a great birthday gift because of its positive message and also because the proceeds support Alex's cause. ALEX SCOTT - you are our hero!!! Thank you for all that you and your family have done and continue to do for those in need."
5,Brilliant,Won Kar Wai has done it again. He is known for Chungking Express and Fallen Angel. If you love foreign films and aren't totally homophobic you should see this movie. The love between the characters is unmistakeable.
3,A Window to the Past,"Want a peek at what recipes used to look like? Nobody expected perfection because we were all winging it to a certain extent. Great for ideas and a REAL biscuit recipe. Know this is for cooks who enjoy freedom, have guidence, or for people who prefer doing things the hard way. I appreciate all the trivia."
5,Great workout,"This is an intense and muscular workout. Uses basic moves, like the squat and muscular yoga. makes you sweat! I've taken these calsses at the gym- this is a great intro to her program"
5,Nice and solid.,And easy to install. I used a drill press to get a good hole and in minutes I had the switch I needed on my bathroom light bar.
5,Definitly worth it if you want the best,"This cable isn't cheap. So why pay so much for it? Why not just buy a cheap s-video cable? Because the quality suffers. They don't just jack up the price for no reason. Gold tipped connecters, more shielding from interference, thicker wire, and better quality materials used provides a better picture. Colors are more vibrant, the whole picture more defined. You get what you pay for, and this Monster Cable is definitly proof of that. I have this cable and it is worth it. Monster all the way."
3,MAYBE IT'S JUST ME?,"I've just finished reading Tanya Anne Cosby's,""ON BENDED KNEE"".First of all,i have to say that after my initial reservations,i did fall in love with the characters.Colin Mac Brodie did not pretend to be anything other then he was.Colin was a womans man!Seana(gorgeous name)was such a sweetheart.I just wanted to hug her and tell her that everything would turn out o.k. in the end.At times during the book i did laugh out loud and at times i cried.So why the three stars instead of five?The storyline seemed to be more prominant then the characters!There was not enough tension between the characters.Their relationship was not consumated until the last few pages!There could have been alot more jealousy and misunderstanding thrown in to the story.After reading""PERFECT IN MY SIGHT"" and ""HAPPILY EVER AFTER"",i know for a fact that Tanya is talented.I just think that for all of it's potential,""ON BENDED KNEE"" did not deliver all that it could have!"
4,Deal of the day,"Got this as the deal of the day. Lion King is always great, got the second and third movies for basically the price of the original blu-ray alone. Packaging is a little much, but great buy all said and done."
4,Great!,"The movies are great! The picture is awesome! The sound in Lion King 1 is 7.1, the other are only 5.1 which may be a drawback for some. The packaging is by far the worst part about this, it is so large and clumsy. The sleeves that hold the discs are a pain, and the box doesn't fit in on my shelf next to my other blurays very nicely. I wish the 3 movies were released seperately so that I could have them in standard bluray cases, but oh well, I guess this will have to do, The movies are so good its worth the extra trouble for me personally."
5,Awesome Polarized Light...works great,"My husband works on small, delicate electronics items and needs light that won't tire his eyes or reflect off the metal. This lamp has fantastic light, it's very natural, but yet polarized so your eyes won't tire and there's no glare. That to me is worth every penny. It's sturdy and sits on the desk without tipping. The light is concentrated so it won't go far as some people have noted but it is task lighting not general lighting. He loves it so I would highly recommend this lamp for those who work on small objects. It would also make a nice reading lamp if the light were to be over your shoulder. Hope that helps your decision."
5,For anyone who has or teaches young children,"Ellen Cromwell has written a beautiful book and curriculum that captures all that is important for young children in early learning environments. A deep understanding of young children and the uniqueness of this time of life is evident in her writing. I have explored and used many curricula for young children, but none of them is as responsive to the ultimate needs of young learners as this one - based on play, learning (nurturing readiness), the arts and nurture. Her writing is beautiful, and her advocacy for young children is so ""right on"" it often brought tears to my eyes. I have used this book as the textbook in my community college classes, and my students love it as well. Cromwell clearly and simply presents the essentials of an early childhood curriculum. She cuts through all the rhetoric about early childhood to the heart of what we intuitively know young children need to be ""ready to learn""."
2,Triathlete Mag,"This magazine has some good training tips and all but it does devote alot of space to high profile race results and what the pros are doing. I guess Im more interested in what I can do to improve, so I really dont care much about what the pros are doing all the time. There are alot of advertisments as well, which are good to a point, but they overdo it a little."
5,Ironman checked off the bucket list,"I ordered Triathlete Magazine for my brother last year when he announced he would be competing in the Arizona Ironman 2010; he had never done a triathlon, let alone, an Ironman! He loved this magazine and it helped him get ready for his first Ironman. He found the stories inspirational and the training advice motivating and informative. I've renewed his subscription again this year. Maybe Kona is in his future..."
1,Worst subscription EVER,"I ordered a subscription to Triathlete Magazine back on April 24 as a gift for a friend and here we are on September 7th and she still has not received it. It's due to expire in July of 11. HA! I will never order from them again!If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would."
4,i am reading it rightnow!,i giveit an eight so far. elizabeth is so darn pushy bout stuff! good lord. but itis a wonderful book so far! i got it intentionally thinking it would be just like the movie and it is but it isn't right?
5,The ship gets old but the book dosen't,"Not only can you read it once in one sitting but I found you can read it over and over and never get sick of it. The characters are very interesting, the plot is close to what a real life scenario could be and Diane Hoh captures the difference of the worlds of Elizabeth Farr and Katie Hanrahan perfectly. There's suspense, a little bit of action and some definte romance happeneing here. Pick this book up for a little bed time reading, a rainy day or just something for your spare time... you won't be dissapointed."
3,Basic waterproof -- good value for money,"Pros: Easy to focus (even with my perscription glasses). Good value for money.Cons: They are heavy; wish they were any color but green; and most of all, the neck strap is way too thin. But I have bought other binoculars and the straps are always too thin and cut if you want to wear them around your neck.Bottom line: I would still buy them again. Will search for a replacement strap."
3,Cord wheel,"it does hold 100' of cord, but it would have been way more useful, if it could plug into an outlet and let you unroll the cord as it is plugged in."
1,Poor design! I returned it. It's much easier to not use it.,"We ordered this along with 100ft of cord and our electric snowblower, it was a good deal- but a great pain.You have to reel one end of the plug under the whole cord, and while you wind it up, the plug hits the reel handle and the sides. In order to use your cord, you have to unwind the whole length of it. What a pain. It doesn't work like a hose reel, where you'd hook one end up to one connection which in turn hooks up to the outlet. I stopped using it after the first time. I can't believe I had to spend as much time as I did trying to figure it out, I then showed it to my husband who also said ""WTF"". Though he was able to wind up the cord, it looked like a tool that a clown would use."
4,coed wheeel,"Fast deli. nice product but it looks it can break easily, seems cheaply made. would like to see a heavier duty."
2,"Plastic, not meant for outside cords","I am sure this is a nice product, but not for the purpose I bought it for.I bought a snow blower with a 100 foot outdoor cord,You can't use this, just pulling on it would knock it on its side.For light weight things, inside electrical perhaps ok."
5,As good as new...,"Being too young to really know much about Ms. Gore's early pop career, I got turned onto her music by a friend who took me to one of her live shows. Without the need to compare the old with the new interfering with my experience of her performance, I simply took it for what it is --- brilliant, moving, full of soul! I bought the record, and now it's one of my favorites."
4,I really like this album!,"I don't even remember what made me purchase this album 14 years ago, but I am glad I did! It still gets occasional play, especially ""What it is"" and ""Lemonade"". Pure gives you an album full of pretty standard alternative rock consistent with the mid 90's, but they have just enough of a unique sound to make the album stand out. This is a good add for anyone looking to discover an under the radar 90's alt. rock band."
5,"Great mix of modern Jazz, Jeff style, Cool!","This is a very interesting CD, that I enjoy keep coming back to and hear new things on it every time."
1,Mega-Boring!,"The most boring book I have ever read. I deeply regret the waste of money. Story of a drug-adict and lousy ""poet"" told in ten times as much detail as any sane person could possibly need to know. Frankly, I think it a scandal that money was wasted in publishing such garbage.The author could do with a few lessons in English, too."
3,Mistaken Order,"It was our mistake, but we thought we were purchasing the much better boneless/skinless club sardines from Seasons, which are very good. These are not as good, although they are better than the cheaper branded sardines."
5,Good Fish,"These sardines are larger and tastier than many I 've tried costing more. The taste in olive oil is purely lite and tasteful. Add some tabasco, for added pop."
4,"Perfect for holding games, not memory sticks.","This would be the perfect product for UMD storage - it's a hard shell, holds 8 games firmly in place, works perfectly. I only give it four stars because the image states it also holds memory sticks and it does NOT actually have a space for these. You cannot store memory sticks in this case, which is half the reason I bought this case. So I am disappointed by that, but oh well, it's a fine UMD holder which really was more important to have anyways."
1,i cancelled order,I cancelled the order for the psp because you kept delaying the delivery date and I went to WalMart and bought 3 of them right off the shelf. I was very disappointed in the pre-ordering process for this psp.
4,"Good case, a little bulky and hard to take UMD's out","My title says it all, the case is nice and well-built. It is bulky though and hard to keep with you. Also the UMD's are held in very tightly and are hard to get out. I've had a few times that I thought I was going to break the disc.Pretty good product overall."
5,Awesome Book,"This book, and the others in the Air Disaster series (4 volumes as of Oct 2006), are compelling and interesting reads.Highly Recommended"
1,My bag ripped too.,I was so disappointed in this bag. I too registered for it and thought I would love it. I wanted it because it wasn't too girly and my husband agreed he would carry it. I also liked that it had a separate place for bottles.I no longer use this bag because the lining has ripped and it is just a pain. I am using a different bag.Please don't buy this unless you are ready and willing to deal with a ripped bag. Save your money.
2,...it's all true,"..it's all truethe lining rips (even if youre a gentle user, like me)and the insulater is not insulated,even condisation will leak through and leave stains!..it could have been a great bag, plenty of room, easy to carry, fits on stroller handles and the straps dont fall off shoulders."
3,IF YOU LIKE STONEKEEP IT'S A GREAT BOOK,"The title says averthing, if you like the game the book help understand it a LOT."
1,Does not support up to 30 pounds,the item i wanted to hang was only 15 lbs...it wouldn't support it...and about broke finger when it snapped..wasted my money on this purchase...
4,Works Great,It works just as advertised! I don't really think that anything else needs to be said but as you require it I added this sentence!
2,Terrible,"Really not very strong. I have tried approx. 20 different adhesives and this was the one I thought was gonna be it. It was not. I am trying to repair a glass piece with a clean break. Followed instructions to a T and thought it worked but after only 1 day it fell apart. I highly doubt this is what professionals use as the product description says. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because I'm sure that if you are repairing an object that is for show and never to be handled it would work fine. But if you expect to be able to handle the fixed object you are repairing for this you will be very disappointed. I'm trying to fix a ""Tobacco"" Pipe."
3,Simultaneously inspiring and disappointing,"Though the text of this book evidences a brilliant, well read mind filled with sagacious insights into the difficulties of making art, the paintings themselves, while sometimes beautiful, are sometimes amateurish. She makes her own paints out of dry pigment and the how to do section on this is unique. She applies paint by using the side a of flat brush and dabbing on the paint. Her darks are made by combinations of ultramarine, and cadmium red and cadmium yellow. If you know anything about paints, you will be able to predict the muddy, opaque mess likely to result from such mixes. All this said, she employs a limited palette and has a unique approach and I learned a great deal from her book. Several paintings, like the cover, are unique in their focus on fleeting light effects in water. She is highly influenced, when all is said and done, by Monet and many of he paintings look like Monet style oils -- hard to believe they are in watercolor."
2,don't bother,"I bought this set hoping to supplement the Looney Tunes Golden Collection. If that's your plan, don't bother. Practically everything here is on one of the Golden Collection discs. Sure, ""greatest hits"" compilations are convenient. But as other reviewers have noted, a lot of these classic shorts have been hamhandedly redacted.Note the title of this set: ""Looney Tunes Movie Collection."" Sounds pretty comprehensive! Odd, then, that the second movie is omitted. What you get here are the first (1979) and third (1982) Bugs Bunny movies. What you WANT is the second (1981) movie, which has ""Knighty Knight Bugs"" on it. (Y'know the one: Yosemite Sam rides the dragon and gets flattened by the drawbridge. You can't get that cartoon on DVD.) Yes, what we want is ""The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie."" No such luck."
3,Sundial - 'Acid Yantra' (Atlantic),"Even though 'Acid Yantra' isn't their best work,this 1995 catalog title is still worth check out. Best described,as some WOULD say shoegazing psychedlic (I've always HATED that term,for some reason). Tracks I was semi-impressed with were the *ss-kicking ""3000 Miles"",""Bad Drug"",the adventurous ""Fly Into The Sun"" and ""Yantra Jam"". Personnel on this effort was strictly a duo,of Gary Ramon-guitar,mellotron&vocals and Craig Adrienne-tabla,drums,vocals and mixing. Just might appeal to some fans of Flaming Lips,Mercury Rev and Spiritualized."
1,Green Backpack by Fisher Price,"I bought this bag because most diaper bags are way to bulky. I have a four week old and a six year old so my hands are tied when I go out without my husband. I hated the way you get into the bag, there is no way to lock it and open it with one hand. I use the disposable bottles and the were to wide to fit into the bottle pockets. I bought it because I thought it would be a good size but it was all wrong for my needs. I am still on the search for ""THE PERFECT DIAPER BAG!"""
3,Needs a glossary,"The book is very comprehensive and I got a few important points out of it. The frustration is that it used technical terms from the very beginning, which were either explained (or inferable) later in the book or never explained at all. I wonder how much background in plastic molding the other readers had if they found this easy to read. Also, the sentence structure reminded me of my college term papers: Never say, ""It smells bad"" when you can say ""Issues of noxious fumes that were held to have a negative olefactory effect have limited the usefulness of this particular composition."""
5,"Great, informative book!","Dan Robey is the best self-help writer I have read to-date! I have gleaned wonderful, not to mention extremely helpful, information from his book ""The Power of Positive Habits."" I believe that this book can help every member of your family. This is one investment that I am truly proud of making."
1,what?,"I don't understand the reviews for this book. It's nothing but a bunch of common sense that you can find ANYWHERE! What's the deal with the price being so high? I sold mine because, hey, I could use the $40+ dollars people are shelling out for it. Just my opinion, save your money."
4,"thoughtful, intensive, well-written","This is a very informative and crisply written history of environmental thought and politics in the U.S., from John Muir to Peter Singer. It offers a great deal of thoughtful commentary, for example on the gradual shift in focus from tangible benefits for humans (underlying the conservation and national parks movement circa 1900) to inherent rights of nature itself (signalled e.g. by the Endangered Species Act). It's not hard to see that Nash is sympathetic to many of these causes, and clearly this book isn't for folks who prefer to view things in strictly economic terms, but still it is quite well-balanced in tone, and the scholarship is really impressive. I highly recommend it to anyone interested at all in the environmental movement, or American intellectual history generally, or simply looking for some thought-provoking reading. 220 pp., plus 50 pp. of notes."
5,National Board Certified Physics Teacher Loves It,"This pack is an outstanding resource for students enrolled in college preparatory physics courses, or AP Physics B courses. The explanations are concise and clear. A student reading these books and completing the tests will understand the core concepts, be able to solve basic problems, and attack classroom physics tests with confidence.As a teacher, I have found the series an invaluable resource for developing test items, and refining my lecture notes. I look to this series of books as a primary curricular standard for my college preparatory physics course."
1,Nero PhotoShow Deluxe 4,"Simplicity is with the picture slide show available in Nero 7,but it is limited, to among other things, 99 pictures. And it is a great deal easier to use than PhotoShow Deluxe 4. Which reminds me of trying to buy a used car. The salesman (in this case Nero) continuously tries to sell you something else. Never mind your concerns about the product you just bought. This product is not user friendly and, for me, failed to save the slide show and since there is no SAVE button... I sent ""Nerosupport"" an Email five days ago today. No response at all. The e-mail address used is contained in the manual. Deluxe 4 does not show a list of the music you desire to play and the film strip of the pictures you want to use is so small; I can't make out what is what. There are some great functions... some just don't work.Would have to rate this Nero product a Do not buy."
2,Cannot Use Mp3 Audio,I purchased Photoshow 4 Deluxe specifically to put my Mp3 tracks to a slide show. It does not work as advertised. Even after going through support they ran into the same problems and said they would get back to me which they did not. Otherwise it works well if you like the alternate artist music they provide(I do not) Disappointed in their ability to update to fix problems. Even their Photoshow 5 did not fix the problem as I would have bought it.
4,Beware ! One woman on the loose !,"A western film that stands upside down right on its head. Many thieves and robbers, on the frontier with Mexico, in the midst of the Mexican Revolution, with Mexican soldiers and Mexican revolutionaries, with all kinds of gangsters and other outlaws, with frightened bankers who get held or blown up, with women who are nothing but entertainment. Well, nearly all of them, except one who is a master mind in getting rich on the back of the thieves and robbers, the soldiers and revolutionaries, the gangsters and outlaws, the bankers and cops when necessary. She manipulates all of them men with her charm and flesh and she gets the money when it is ripe, without even making the slightest effort, except at luring all these men into falling into her trap. And you can be sure she never shuts her trap. Brilliant and funny with a Lolobrigida that is coming of age and starting her lovely and enticing career.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
3,Imperfect understanding of oppression,"Herbert has a fascination with oppression, which makes for good stories occasionally, but not this time. The idea that a poisoned world (Dosadi), cut off physically from the rest of the universe, with most of the world's population concentrated in a small area would produce astute and cunning political leaders is absurd. Look around at the real world. The places most oppressed produce liars and tyrants as their political leaders.Ignoring that, the story is somewhat interesting. As a social experiment, put two different intelligent species on a poisonous planet, where the population had to group together in concentrations rivaling downtown Manhattan during the day, then see what happens. It's, also, a sort of quasi-meandering on law.Taking the book as just a book it's not bad, but taking it as a book written by Frank Herbert, the writer of the Dune series, it's a serious disappointment."
3,Hoping for a certain cartoon...,"I enjoyed the ""What's Opera, Doc?"" on Collection 2, but i am also waiting for a few not released yet, such as ""Ten little Rabbits""(a parady of an old movie called ""Ten Little Indians"") and ""Knighty-Night Bugy Bunny"", which supposedly won an award(sorry i don't remember which reward). I hope they release these soon on another collection...."
4,Noteables that are still absent...,Can someone please explain how Blacque Jacques Shellacque and 'Operation: Rabbit' don't make the cut for three volumes of four-CD sets?
5,Banned Cartoon or Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips,"I would like to see ALL of the Banned cartoons in a DVD Box Set.And to you people who like to Whine and Cry that they Offend you i have only this to say:: Don't Watch Them.It's funny, Archie Bunker and Fred Sanford used to Pop Cracks at Everyone and No One raised an eyebrow, suddenly everyone is Offended by a Rabbit named Bugs. SAD"
1,WARNING - SOME DEFECTIVE SETS OUT THERE!!,"I purchased this volume along with volumes 1 & 2. After watching both volumes without incident, I pulled off the factory seal on volume 3 and discovered, instead of the DVDs, there were 5 BLANK Memorex CD-Rs! I'm not blaming Amazon, because they don't make the things. I writing this mainly as a warning to other customers. Amazon has allowed me to return the defective set and is sending me a replacement. I will post a review of the set once I receive it. Volumes 1 & 2 were great."
3,"4 stars for the stars, 2 for the film","This is another MGM musical in which you just ignore the plot and enjoy the numbers. Ann Miller - ""I Gotta Hear That Beat""...Nat King Cole - ""My Flaming Heart""...Bobby Van ""Take Me to Broadway"". Jane Powell was getting too old to continue playing the innocent maiden, but as usual turns in a good performance despite the material. Billie Burke, Glinda of the WIZARD OF OZ and Fay Wray, of KING KONG fame round out the cast."
3,Uncomfortable,"I wouldn't call this fabric ""microfiber"", it's more of a nylon swimsuit material. I was hoping for something with a bit more coverage in the rear...maybe if you don't have so much ""junk in the trunk"" they would fit you better. I doubt going up in size would help since the fit seemed good width-wise, just not long enough. I also did NOT like the seam in front that kept riding up in a most uncomfortable way. Next time I will look for something that is tagless, as this is not."
4,great for the price!!,Just what my son wanted and a great price! Big enough for all his books and then some!
4,Good not quite approprite,"a great book but for immatured people it is a bad idea... in one part it gives a very,very grafic depiction of the sexual actions exibited by 16 year old Jenny and Chris"
2,Why?,"...Basically I think that this book was way to simple. I dunno if I was dazed while I was reading or what, but there were a lot of detailes and complexity that was missing. The whole book was kinda boring and kinda pointless as well. Im very disapointed of Philip Pullman because all of his other books (the ones that I've read anyway) were brilliant and this one just wasn't up to par."
1,Could it get any worse,"Look, the book was OK, but...its the worst book Ive ever read. Its not even original, Its a reteeling of Romeo and Juliet. The plot twists is really bad and predictable. COME ON PEOPLE! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT ITS REALISTIC. I MEAN, BY COINCIDENCE, SHE JUST HAPPENS TO-- I DONT WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY. If your curious and bored enough, read the book. Even 10 year-olds can see that this is not realistic, Phil Pullman is a fairy tale writer and he should stick to that By the way, the sex scene is not that shocking, its just plain..let me put it this way, it was written by a horny, bald, peverted 40 year old man."
5,EXCELLENT!,This has been my favorite candy since I was a kid in Hong Kong. SO HAPPY to find it on Amazon!
4,Good product,"Good MP3 player for working out/jogging and the recording ability is a bonus. Recording quality is ok. The controls are not very intuitive however and you have to really become familiar with them in order to be able to use all of the features. Not something you can just pick up and use without reading the instruction manual! If you aren't technologically inclined you might want to keep looking for something with simpler controls, but if you actually know how to set the clock on your VCR (does anyone still have VCRs?!) then you should be ok with this product."
3,Training and combat in World War II.,"Vernon was a naval pilot in World War II and flew Hellcats. This story is his experiences during the later part of the conflict. Much of his story concerns his experiences during his training at various naval bases. This experiences relate to the difficulty in learning to fly and qualifying as a naval aviator.Other expiences such as dating and drinking and playing cards are also related in this time period. The last 40-50 pages dealt with combat experience and how he adjusts to losses through both training and combat.I enjoyed this read very much, but there are so many books just like his out on the market. There is no unique material in here, just a story of an average man making an adjustment to his life to fight for his nation. Our nation in built upon the sacrifices of young people like him."
2,Poor Christian Character,"J.P. Holding has many good intentions, but his efforts in apologetics are marred by his use of mockery and insult. As a brother in the Lord I cannot support Holding's ministry. Mockery and insult have no place in any ministry representing Jesus Christ, much less apologetics. Often Holding even likes to insult other Christian ministers like in this following quote insulting Francis Schaeffer. ""Schaeffer was not a serious Biblical scholar but a theologian with' no relevant credentials for contextual exegesis. His son Franky is a legacy of his lack of competence in that regard."""
4,beauty,A beautiful book. But why buy it? The information about people is just enough to wet one's interest. The patterns aren't anything special. It is simply a beautiful book to look at and dream.
3,Ok product.,"Product arrives as the pre-cut plastic protector and separate adhesive strips. You need to apply the strips yourself (they are very small and fine, almost rubbery, and difficult to apply with accuracy. They give you several extras in case you make a mistake) and then apply the protector directly to the camera's display. Get it right the first time; the adhesive is very strong and I'd be worried about pulling the camera's LCD cover off if you had to remove the protector to realign it.Make sure you clean the protector and LCD! Otherwise that fingerprint will be trapped forever!The protector is not an exact match for my LCD (Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT). The shape is slightly off in the corners. It also covers up some of the writing on the screen.Cheaply designed product, but it does it's job."
1,Support/Website Issues,"Christmas morning. Traffic Jam on Webkinz. Tearful kids and mad parents because they now have a useless toy and a code that says it is invalid, because THE WEBSITE WAS JAMMED!Ganz knows how many toys they sold. They could have and SHOULD have been prepared to handle the children that would be busy trying to register and play with thier webkinz for the first time. Very dissappointing and frustrating."
1,LAME!,"TINY! AND SOOOOOOOO NOT WORTH IT! ITS DURABLE AND THATS IT! MY ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES CATS, SHE SEEN THIS AND WAS OVER IT RIGHT AWAY! IT DOESNT EVEN LOOK LIKE A CAT! IT LOOKS LIKE A LUMPY BALL OF CHEAP STUFFED ANIMAL FUR! ITS RIDICULOUS! ID PAY A DOLLAR FOR THIS AT THE DOLLAR STORE......FOR A CHEW TOY FOR MY DOG! WASTE OF MONEY!"
4,I'm reading it now,"I bought this to replace a book entitled ""The Woman"" which is probably out of print, which I'd had for more than 40 years until it disintegrated. The copy I received shows its age in yellowed pages and obvious shelf wear. However, it's otherwise in good condition. It arrived over-packaged in packaging difficult to open."
5,Yes,"I loved it ,and I hope the other ones are just as good. I have a feeling they will be. can't wait"
5,Amazing,I read this book in two hours. I couldn't put it down. It really drew me in! I recommended this book to any teen girl out there
4,Amazingly Relatable,"I loved this book because it was relatable,funny,and steamy. It ended like a fairytale. I think this book describes the majority of high school life."
4,Amazed,"I wasn't sure how I would feel reading this book as a junior about a freshman, but it was pretty good."
3,Great ending,The book was enjoyable though not one of my favorites. But I do recommend you read it if you haven't already.
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,It was the cutest thing ever!! I hope i meet a great guy like Colin. Hes so sweet. It was an amazing book
4,Putting boys on the ledge,"I really enjoyed this book. I had finished it before I could comprehend every detail. I highly recommend this book for preteen girls who are as obsessed with boys as I was. I feel like it covers everything girls need to know about guys, besides the thong part. How blue felt after Colin kissed her was exactly how I felt as well. Usually it's hard for me to find a book I just can't put down and this book was an excellent example!"
5,Aww!!!,"Oh my gosh I really loved it I thought heath sounded dreamy at first, but then when Colin came into the story I was swept off my feet. He just seems completely perfect, like be exactly my kind of guy, cause I love the barn and the animals and he just was a great character, easily my favorite. When blue had her first kiss I was like teary eyed because I've never been kissed and I thought that's exactly how I want my first kiss to be. I want the author to write another story about a girl named summer with curly light brown hair freckles and green brown eyes , so that I can be even more swept off my feet because that's e exactly how I look!!! Once again, a really great book I'm going to read it again and again."
2,Bad color and fit,"I ordered this to match my steering wheel and floor mats. first of all its a lighter blue than the others. second of all, it doesnt fit snug on my seats, but i have the detachable headrest, even though it says these seat covers fit over them.i wouldnt recommend this to anyone"
3,Codependents book,"I received the correct book, however, the cover was different than the one I ordered. It wasn't worth the effort to return it, so I kept it."
1,Junk quality - Inferior - I give it 0 Stars!!!,"I got this printer bundled with the computer I bought. Thequality of this printer is remarkably bad. It has acheap paper feed mechanism that ""eats"" paper through thetop. Paper jams with nearly every print job. A 10 pagepaper can take as long as 45 minutes!!!! Even theconstruction of the unit uses inferior plastic. EverytimeI open it up to clear a paper jam, I'm afraid theplastic will break.This was an incrediby poor unit for Lexmark to use asan introduction model. My frustration level with this printerwas so off the charts, that I would never buy a Lexmarkunder ANY circumstances."
3,"A Fun Read, But","This was an enjoyable, quick read, and as always with plays, is better left to watch the stage version. Though I was initially pleased with the ending, and the story stayed with me, I still wonder about the point of it, what the message way.Still, I enjoyed the writing and reading the play."
1,Less than impressed,"For the price, I think a good pair of Zeiss binoculars, mounted on a tripod, is a far better package."
4,A definite must have,"I had a copy of this book for several years and some how it disappeared. I refer to it before dating and have found that 90 percent of the comments are true when it comes to my compatibility sexually, intellectually, and emotionally with other signs of the zodiac...it's amazing...Now that I am single again and have lost my copy of the book, I feel naked without my friend, Sexual Astrology, by my side."
5,Outstanding,This is one of the first books that I have read on astrology that has been so close to home that it gave me the creeps. I was amazed at how exact this book was. It told a side of me that very few men have ever seen. I highly recommend this book for those who are either very intune to themselves or are willing to get intune and experiment.
4,WOW!,"This female Capricorn is still blushing! I was startled to read a couple of the specifics (no, I do NOT bite), but give it an overall 90% accurate. The only ""issue"" I had was that the sign compatability sections weren't consistent. Cancer-Capricorn is different than Capricorn-Cancer, which seems a bit counterintuitive to me."
1,Sounds Good When it Last - Piece of Junk,"It sounds great when it works, my first amp died within the warranty period so Klipsch send me another amp after I send them mine but it too almost 2 months of turn around time and mailing charge. After another 9 months of use, just yesterday the bass started to go again, I am not sending it back for repair this time and it is going to the trash. Klipsch should never release a product like that, every forum I goes to the user has the same faith. If your speaker is working right now, good luck and enjoy it, it will go the same way with all the others in the near future. I am going to get the Logitech Z5500 instead."
2,Failed,"These were great speakers when they worked. Failed after 2 years, Klipsch wanted over $150 to repair them. Sub died and would make aloud buzzing noise. I don't think I'd buy a set of Klipsch Speakers again, its such a shame because when they worked the sound and base was amazing."
2,Good sound but mine failed too.,"I bought these at the full retail price when they were first introduced. They worked well for 2 years then the amp apparently failed. I still use the speakers with a good quality home theatre receiver and a new subwoofer.I read about the amp failures in the previous ProMedias but the problem was supposed to be addressed in the Ultras. Not for me.Given the choice again, I would have purchased a decent home theatre system to start with and used that with my computer instead."
2,I'm luckier than most - mine failed after 2 years,"Well -- I was sastified with this for two years, but today I went to turn them on and all I got was muffled sound, clicking, and distortion. Sounds like I have the exact same amp failure as everybody else. Treat Klipsh products as what they are -- DISPOSABLE!"
3,dead amp,"I would like to give these speakers 5 stars because they sound great, but I'm giving them 3 because the sub amp died a year ago. I never got the sub fixed because I read on Klipch's forums, that many had the same problem I did and once they got it fixed, the same thing ended up happening again. I am going to get a new desktop soon and am now reading reviews for speakers to replace these. I also found out that they are discontinued. They should have fixed the amp problem and still be selling these. They were great sounding speakers."
4,i feel sooo lucky,"wow, after reading all the bad failure reports in previous posts i sure feel lucky. i bought these 5 years ago, and to date are the best sounding speakers i have ever heard, specially the sub woofer which when testing a low frequency sine wave (at full +15) will vibrate all the windows on 3 floors of my house/ an old victorian. And i have had NO problems with any speakers. I do have a problem with one of the controllers 1/8 headphone jack,which doesnt connect well sounds scratchy / took over 3 years to fail, slightly a common problem with heavily used ports. if i could replace the controller i would.but this is SO minor next to all the other problems i could have. otherwize I guess im just lucky to have a continually working great set of speakers."
4,"Great speaker system, amp finally blew","I bought these in 2002 and they sounded great. I've had them for around 7+ years and last week, the amp finally blew. I took it apart and replaced the blown fuse and then the new fuse blew. The amp is finally dead, but I can't complain as I've had these for awhile. I always used them and had the volume cranking and they sounded great until the minute the amp blew. I replaced these with a Sony 5.1 Home Theater system and actually re-used these speakers and they still sound great!"
4,"Practicing Therapists ""Must Read"" Each Year","Ethics in Psychology is a graduate level textbook on the subject of ethical dilemmas in counseling. The authors definitely meet their goal in exploring the APA's Ethical guidelines and applying them pratically to the practicing therapist and academic. Their use of humorous ""psuedo-psychologists"" illustrate well the problem of many counselors who get themselves into ethical dilemmas each year innocently. I believe every therapist and academic should read this book at least once a year in order to minimize the ethical issues that are a part of everyday practice. Non-APA practitioners may find the book slanted toward doctoral-level therapists being the minimum for competence but there is great wisdom in this book."
4,Solid Record With Future Room to Grow,"This record has a solid set songs with the featured highlights 'Thought You Should Know' and 'Daytimers' leading the way. What I like about this record is that the lyrics are honest and the music, although not revolutionary, is full of tastefull hooks. My only complaint about the record is the length, I think Nimbus Luna could have cut out a song or two and made it a five star record instead of a four but that was there choice. It seems like this band has just hit their stride and has a room to grow in the future. I have to respect the band for selling the record at such a reasonable price it gives listeners like me the chance to try something new."
3,Know why VHS is dead technology now,"One of those good old lost movies. It's good to see Richard Harris (original ""Dumbledore"") in one of his earlier works in a movie very delightful for its time.Gripes about product is it is VHS, and after watching any VHS on newer TVs that exist today, you wonder how we were ever satisfied with that technology. Picture and sound is terrible. This is a film that at least deserves a DVD in original theatrical quality given there's many more films that deserve less and do have DVDs."
3,Flawed but still the best,This book is wildly overpriced. The Urdu typeface is not friendly to the beginner. There are many discrepancies between the written text and what is read on the CDs. It's too obvious that the speakers are reading. Needed more voices to be realistic. There are errors and inconsistencies in the transliteration. There is far too much English on the CDs.Hower: It's the only Urdu text worth considering. The explanations are good and anyone who persists with this book will learn Urdu.
4,Boht acha!,I have been in the market for two years searching for just the right book. I have found it. It's professional produced and also incorporates the cultural aspects of the language as well. My only discontent with the book is you have to learn the written script as well in order to follow along after Chapter 5. I didn't learn to read and write English that way. Be forewarned if you just want to learn to speak Urdu.
4,Excellent product,I am very happy with both the book and the CDs and I strongly recommend this product for anyone trying to learn Urdu.I would have give 5 stars if the book provided corrections to exercices.
5,Great album - great band,"I bought both of these albums after hearing a short snippet of the band on SMALLVILLE. They quickly became part of my ""play-it-over-and-over-again"" collection."
5,Over and Over Again,"This is really one of those cds that you can listen to over and over again. I play my cds in my coffee shop, and get asked about this cd almost every time. I think if you like a band like Travis, you would find this cd appealing."
4,One More Time for the Old Tosser,"Although the Humble Pie ""reunion"" stuff is the highlight of this CD, there are several other nice surprises. Of course, you have to be old like me to appreciate them. What are they, covers of some of the old small faces stuff, done quite well. If you want to know more, buy the CD."
3,Needs a life span,"Three years is almost like one hundred thousand miles with a computer controller. Unlike the Play Station controllers I've noticed that there simply not meant for the continues wear and tear. After using it through many great years of Final Fantasy VII for PC the touch buttons finally gave way. Oh, well bought another controller and this worked well for three years. Mark my words the best ten bucks ever spent on a computer part. Besides, got an original used Play Station controller that works just fine after five years of use!"
1,Big waste of money!!!!!,"I bought NBA LIVE 2000, controller goes on its own and buttons do not work .piece of crap."
1,This is crap,This product is junk. I bought it because I didn't want to play Resident Evil 2 with the keyboard... but I ended up playing it with the keyboard anyway and doing much better than the pad. The problem is this: the calibration program is junk. You set a null input and yet your character will spin around as if he/she is doing the Chubby Checker Twist.
1,Don't do it!,"Got the ProPad for Christmas. It loaded and plugged in real easy, but from then on it has been one big disappointment. Tried to use it with Thief, and Tomb Raider 3, but it doesn't work. TR3 she just runs around in circles. With Thief you can't do anything but run, and you lose the map. Check the calibration program folks, it really could use some work."
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!!,I would give this product zero stars. The controller wouldn't work with any game. After many miserable hours of trying to figure it out I tossed it into the trash!!!!
2,47st photo sent Opteka instead of Jobu,"I ordered the Jobu design dual axis level. 47th Photo sent a similar-appearing Opteka instead. I placed the Opteka on a flat table; the bubble moved to one of the tube, as if the table were not level. I then rotated the level horizontally 180 degrees on the same spot on the table. The bubble stayed in that same end of the tube (it should have moved to the opposite end). This suggests that the level had inaccurate calibration.I returned the level to 47st, and a refund, including shipping ($7.95 for such a small item), was posted to an Amazon gift certificate."
3,Good for concept. Inadequate for exam,I am a VB programmer for 2 years. I write most application on local machine. I have very little idea on how DCOM and MTS works.The book is only good for basics. It gave me a good conceptual insight of how distribuetd COM stuff works. But the exam is more difficult and the scope is wider than the book covers.You need to use other supplement to pass teh exam. I recommend Transcender and MSDN.
4,Less sanding dust,"This works well with my dust collector. I still get some dust escaping from boards that are 11"" by 32""."
5,"Bought one, went back for more.","I bought one set (of three) of these at a major bed/home store and went back for more. These are great - they have a little hook to piggy back two, or three, hangers downward as pictured. Note - they also have a model which has five blouse hangers built into one rack. It's a little cheaper per shirt but more awkward to use - maybe ok for very light sleeveless tops, polo shirts, etc. Otherwise I prefer to get a few sets (of three) of this type."
2,Much Cheaper Elsewhere!!!!,"These hangers are great, and if I were rating just the product, I would give 5/5 stars.However, I gave so few stars on this review because they are way overpriced here. You can get the same exact hangers from the same brand at places like Bed Bath & Beyond for just $5.99, that's more than 30% cheaper! Get the product, but save your $ and go elsewhere for it."
1,Too Slow,This one I found to be too slow and plodding. There's too much description and not enough action going on. Couldn't finish.
5,Blessed are the Meek,"Touching and beautiful. Two words not usually associated with horror fiction. After having read so much mind numbing ""crap"" lately, this book was refreshing. My first but definitely not last Braunbeck story."
2,A Great Story Poorly Told,"I'm a fan of Bukowski's work, so I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, I gave up on it after the first 200 pages. The events of his life are so interesting and definitely worth reading about, but this biographer's writing style was repetitive and dull. Every page is essentially: ""Bukowski made this statement in (insert the name of an interview or Bukowski book here), so it must have happened like this.....""I'm sure there are much better Bukowski bios out there. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Why?,"I own an Iomega Zip 250 drive, and I used it... for about a week.I thought it would be great to back-up web sites, and to transfer files between my computers at home, but then I just found it easier to spend the money on a 4 port networking hub and a good CD writer.Zip drives are nowhere near as dependable as a CD-R or RW, and CDs cost less money, plus Cds hold more information.I work at a printing company, and do a lot of freelance web work, so I get a lot of different types of media, and I have to say that if everyone just bought a CD writer, it would make life a lot easier."
1,What is this?,"Sorry, but this was just a BAD movie... yes the actors were young, but there ARE people out there who are young and can act. The plot was shallow and far-fetched. Overall, I'd say there's a reason nobody has seen this."
5,Good Clean Fun,"I love this movie. It was fun inventive and clever. The story is cute and written by Stewart St. John (Sabrina, Power Rangers and many cartoons on the Cartoon Network). I would suggest this to everyone that is looking to just sit down and watch a feel good movie. Also, the music by Boys 2 men is awsome."
4,Grandma....Grandpa?!,"How would you react if your brainy little brother accidently created a formula that could make people young again...and some of it rubbed off on your grandparents? This is a fun movie with a good moral and cool characters. It IS hard to constantly invision the grandparents as young people, but I had that problem with ""Freaky Friday"", too. Some parts may also be iffy for small children, but other then that, this movie is enjoyable and fun to watch when it's on the Disney Channel. And it's on about every two or three months, so I wouldn't recommend buying the movie."
4,The High Commissioner,"Rod Taylor is excellent as the Aussie detective sent to London to arrest an Australian political figure (Christopher Plummer) wanted for murder. Intense, intriguing and set in swinging 60s London, the plot moves along at a great pace with unexpected twists and turns. The Wimbledon Tennis Championships backdrop adds an element of extra interest. Great 60s suspense."
4,A Pretty Good Flick.,"Other reviewers have provided all the details of the movie, so I'll spare you another reading of that information. The bottom-line is this is an interesting film that is even-handed with the historical facts of the time. The film doesnt explain what the Scottish conflict was about, but you can do some remedial reading afterwards to get up to speed. The acting is good. The scenery is excellent. And it is refreshing to see characters with rotten teeth and really bad hair!"
3,Not as good as the old Disney version.,"While this story is not a bad version of the book, you should watch the Disney movie starring among others, James MacArthur as David Balfour and a young Peter Finch ( You might remember him as the man who says "" I'm mad as hell and i'm not going to take it anymore. "" in the movie Network.) as Alan Breck. The movie was made long ago and being a Disney movie, it has all the hallmarks of those old great Disney films, which not only means it is great for kids to watch but also for adults. If you really want to see the only great adaptation of this story, you must see the old Disney version, unfortunatly, it has never been put on dvd,so you'll have to find the vhs version."
1,Soul Stories,"This book is a major waste of time. In ""Seat of the Soul"" Zukav is fascinating, making one wonder how a mere mortal could have such insights into the metaphysical world. ""Soul Stories"" is pointless, boring, like those papers we all wrote at the last minute in college....merely words on paper with no meaning. I saw this guy on Oprah, wearing this look of enlightened bliss talking about what soul stories are. Makes for good daytime TV hype, but that's about it. Do not buy this book, I kept reading while expecting it to get good....it simply doesn't. Sorry, Mr. Zukav, no warm fuzzies on this one."
5,Life Changing,This book changed my life. It provided a whole new perspective at looking at myself and others.
3,WE NEED THIS?,"When I had Thanksgiving dinner with Gary 15 yrs. ago or so at Jean Taupin's, I said ""Gary, I just read your book SEAT OF THE SOUL. I think you should have stayed a Physics guru instead of trying to become a guru guru. Your way out of you're water."" From the latest, I don't think Gary's gotten any smarter."
4,if you need a pep talk...,"This book was the right thing at the right time for me. As I was deciding to leave insitutional ministry and launch out and plant a church, I picked up Seizing Your Divine Moment. During one of the scariest times of my life, Erwin McManus took scripture and applied it in such a way that I was not only encouraged, but I was energized.I highly recommend this book to those who are thinking about their lives and wondering ""What's next?""...and who might even be a little afraid of the answer."
4,A great read,"This is the 2nd installment of the jewel Trilogy, Amethyst being the 1st. Emerald was also a very excellant read but not as much as a page turner as the first book.Jason Chase relunctly joins forces with Caithren Leslie believing her to be a notoriius Scottish bounty hunter but instead finds a red geaded beauty. Joining together to after a pair of murderers.Slowly but surely love blooms.It is part of a trilogy"
4,Better than average trackball,"I do digital image editing as a hobby, and I wanted to find an accurate input device to handle fine line editing. I tried two different Kensington trackballs, but both had problems whenever I used slow, flowing movements. Even with clean rollers, the ball would never roll smoothly enough for minute editing. Logitech's use of optical tracking make the motion nearly flawless, almost no straying, even with a pixel-wide brush. I agree that the setup of the ball and buttons requires a bit getting used to, but the new hand position is more comfortable once you adapt to it. Others who are complaining about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome are probably trying to force their hand position to match the usual angle they've used with other trackballs. You need to look at the instructions to see how to rest the arm and wrist properly for this item. I only dropped a star off the rating because it's too dang expensive! It's worth it, but I wish they would give us a break."
1,Laptop owners be wary,"I bought this device and tried to install it with a Dell laptop. What Logitech fails to tell you, until you spend 1 hour on a tech support call, is that this device does not work with laptops with Synaptics touchpads or docking stations. This of course comes out right after following the tech support guy's directions which also fried my machine -- he never bothered to ask these questions up front."
1,carpal tunnel syndrome in 1 easy step,"although this trackball has an appealing look, and may appear to be ergonomic, it is not. I developed chronic wrist pain while using this device. Other people using my TrackMan would complain that it was uncomfortable to use.The reason for this seems to be that usually all your weight rests on your wrist while using this trackball. In addition, any movement that you need to effect is created by moving your wrist, rather than your hand."
4,Love the band!,"I love this band and have seen them live in concert many times. They are great performers and musicians. The only thing I think could have been better is the sound quality of this dvd. Not as clean as I think it should be. Otherwise, a great performance and song selection!"
2,"I wanted to like it, but couldn't","I often like concert videos, and I usually like Irish music. But this one was a bit dull and, more importantly, the sound engineering was simply horrible. There is no excuse for not being able to hear pipes or drums that are clearly miked for the show. And, often, the sound did not synch well with the video. I'll trust the live show was a hoot, but translated very poorly into this video. I wanted to like it, but simply could not get into it.If you want great concert DVD, try Ozomatli or U2 (Boston concert)."
3,"Decent, but he's done better","New Vintage contains a couple of absolute gems in Maynard's version of ""Maria"" and ""Airegin"". If you were lucky enough to see him live, he often kicked off ""Airegin"" in very unique ways. Those two tunes are tight. The remainder of the album is okay weighed down by the mechanical ""Main Title"" from Star Wars. Still, a decent purchase if for nothing more than ""Maria"" and ""Airegin""."
2,"Pictures great, but wording makes no since",I am reselling this one. My 2 year old has no interest in it and it makes no since to me.
3,not great but not terrible either.,"For alvin lee fans this won't be a popular release. Alvin tried to escape his guitar herostatus way too often in his career and this one and the gospel one he did was probably the two farthest away from that image. Another problem is that he named this one 'let it rock' which in his case would have meant screaming hard rock or blues rock or even blues metal, instead you get lots of laid back songs in a mellow rock cd. This is alvin making detour into softer rock. However The song 'let it rock' is a fantastic roots rocker straight out of the 50's that a blast though. It's the one outstanding track on here. a few others though are very good, and a few are average mellow songs. The bonus jam tracks are cooler than the rest of the cd generally. This is one for lee completists I would say. Howver the 'let it rock' song is so cool and made me apprieciate how cool the 50's were really that I am glad I have this one."
1,Buy something else by Alvin,"""Let it rock"" is the only good song on the whole CD. Nuf said. R. Lee Rochester, NY"
5,Monster Power Center HTS3500MKII - Awesome!,Recently complete putting together all electronic components for high-end Home Theater. Last item need was line conditioner. The Price was right and Monster's HTS 3500MK II is an awesome final compliment to the system.
4,Excellent buy,I don't know how well it really works but I feel safer using the Monster Reference PowerCenter HTS 3500 MKII.up grading from the Monster power bar 1100.I chose the HTS 3500 MKII for it's rear inputs giving me a cleaner installAND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT..
4,works well,"Price was good. I use it to switch on a separate Amp when my preamp is turned on and it works well. I don't know how well the surge protection works, but you never know that until its too late. The meter on the front is cool. I liked it enough to purchase a second one for a different system."
4,Propaganda's workings,"This book, while at times dry and actually boring, is an excellent starting point for realizing the extent of anti-male bigotry that is allowed, even mandated, in America today. I would have preferred to see more examples covered in less detail, however."
3,Odd and Creative,"This book is very interesting. I was not at pleased with it as I expected, though. The photographer is creative and portrays some very interesting situations. Most of the book is in black and white. Many of the pictures are entirely too strange for my tastes. They have often been warped a little too much, rendering the images too busy and, in some cases, unrecognizable. The pictures are fascinating, but do not purchase this book unless you intend to view extreme modifications to photographs."
4,Aircraft of WWII is a solid & concise reference,"""Aircraft of WWII"" is a concise and thorough reference of World War II combat aircraft. It provides photos, technical specifications, and operational histories for all major and most minor aircraft types. A unique and useful feature is the author includes production levels for each aircraft in the statistics section which has often not been included in other similar reference books. Some drawbacks to the book include a lack of clarity about which exact aircraft models the technical data refers to, and some errors in the tech specs converting measurements from the metric system into the English system and vice versa. Other than this however this book is worth owning."
5,Netgear FS728TP Review,"With traffic on networks increasing and new devices being regularly added, you need a network switch that will not only cope with your current demmand, but will also be futureproof. The FS728TP does all that. With power over ethernet it can provide power to voice over IP phones on your network, remote webcams, etc therefore removing the need for local power sources for them.This really is a switch that suits all users - from the basic user this is effectively plug and play - just connect your devices and it works out of the box. With other more advanced features such as QoS, SNMP, Web based configuration & DHCP it offers plenty of configurability for the more advanced user as well.All in all, this is a great value for money switch with the performance and reliability that Netgear are known for. A highly recommended product!"
4,A very nice effort,"I lead a relatively large business continuity practice and have recommended this book to my team and clients. It's not that there is so much new information for me, but it is packaged very well and the war stories alone are worth the price of admission.If you are looking for a book covering the IT aspects of resilience this is not for you, but if you want some exposure to improving the resilience of the operational side of your organization I believe you will find this book extremely helpful."
4,Interesting book from Britain,"I bought this on a whim, thinking I could do some woodworking on my own. Well, maybe one day. It's a really interesting and inspiring work, and they make it look really easy, too. That fake fireplace is probably my favorite idea from the whole book, although there are a few other ideas that I would love to have as well."
2,Not tough enough!,"I really wanted this to work for my 3-year-old son but within hours of opening it one of the strings had already popped. A few days later and the guitar was in two pieces (came unglued at the neck). Obviously a child that age can be hard on things, but this guitar didn't even put up a fight!"
2,Lots of old school games,"This laptop toy has lots of games, but they are VERY pixely and not at all intuitive. We've had a hard time figuring out most of them. However, for the price, this little toy d√≠ez have a lot of options. Not the best for English language learners."
4,keeps the kids engorssed,"I bought this gift for my three grandsons. They were excited by the fact that they had their ""own computer."" They seemed engrossed by the many options available. My main criticism would be the quality of the screen. It needs to be enhanced and upgraded.Overall a good purchase."
3,Small screen,I bought this as a gift for my three year old. He is very advanced so I was not worried about if he would be smart enough to use it. It has a lot of good educational games. My son always wants to be on my laptop and that is another reason I got this. The part of the screen that has the games on it is very small and is hard to see. I would have liked to have something like this that the entire screen is used. It would be easier to see and it would look more like a computer.
4,Kid's Lap Top,"It's a nice toy, looks almost like a real computer, has a selection of games. The only think I don't like about it is the small screen- the image is not very clear. There are some small parts- the game cartiges thet are easly to break if not gentle."
1,A disapointment,I guess when i saw the price i should have thought that it was to go to be true. The thing broke after less then a week. I would like to tell everyone not to buy this and to look for a better one if they are looking to buy one.
4,"Amazing, especially for the price!","This vibrator lasted me about three years of fairly regular use. I've seen vibrators that cost more than four times as much as this one does that didn't last as long! Also, I got the item from the seller only four days after I ordered it-*well* under the estimated delivery time!"
2,Great package but the DVDs are lacking special features.,"I'm really sad. When I saw this come out in the lunchbox, I rushed my pre-order through Amazon and eagerly awaited my set when it shipped. The lunchbox is, to be sure, quite awesome! But the DVDs inside are sorely lacking. The interviews and commentaries mentioned on the write-ups for the other DVDs of this show that were issued back in 2004/2005 are nowhere to be found on these. I feel greatly cheated because that behind-the-scenes stuff is what I crave. I may have to go out of my way to get the other versions, but I'm probably going to look for a sweet deal on eBay because I feel so cheated. Epic fail on this set. It could have been a 5-star collectible. :("
1,Lunchbox is JUNK!,"If the collectable lunchbox is a reason you might buy this, think again. The rivets pop out without even touching them and the back side of the box will likely arrive with several dents along the edges. An American TV show, but this item is not made in America."
4,Super Saturday Morning Series,"Wesley Eure plays Will in this series about a father and his two children who find themselves trapped on another world while on a river. The Land Of The Lost is a mysterious place with dangerous insect people called Sleestak and all manner of dinosaurs. The series was great originally but bringing into play such characters as Medusa and the Flying Dutchman, ruined the concept. The father left in the last season and was replaced by an uncle which did nothing to help the show so it failed. But early episodes are a total delight and I would recommend it to anyone fan or newbie."
5,Great album,"If you like the StaticX style, this album delivers. Packed with plenty of crunchy rythms, energy and the trademark howl of the vocalist. Lots of energy in this music but its very simple music. A few power chords per song is all you get but they drive those chords hard. I liked the album."
4,Good Solid Metal,"Static X is, in my opinion, some of the more fun metal to listen to. The songs are played well, the lyrics are fun to sing/yell even if they don't mean anything, and the band has time and time again put out good music. This CD continues that trend for the most part. Personally, I liked Start A War and Shadow Zone better but I think this album is better than Wisconsin Death Trip and Machine (but as anyone can tell you, beauty is in the eye/ear of the beholder). Some of the songs on this CD were a little boring such as Team Hate and Electric Pulse but others, such as Destroyer and Behemoth, were great. This album stays true to the fast, vivid, style Static-X has been using for their few albums and though Cannibal tries a few new things with varying levels of success, I am glad I bought it. Music and art are almost impossible to rate so listen to it before ya buy it. Theres my two cents, take it or leave it."
3,sony camcorder,"it is real good camcorder it was just a little too small for my liking, i like to know that i have a video camera in my hands, not some itty bitty thing thats the size of an apple. other that that its good."
4,Loved it!!!!,"I read the novel over one year ago, and thought it was ok. I wasn't too enthusiastic about getting the movie, but caved in during one of my husband's business trips.I was more than pleasantly surprised with this movie. The characters are wonderful and are brought alive with great performances.Even though the film is light, it is not dumbed down like many in this genre (romantic comedy). Perhaps this is due to the subject matter, Jane Austen's novels.The only flaw I found with the movie was Prudie's husband's unrealistic personality switch, turning from an avid sports watcher into a Jane Austen reader. It seemed too much of a stretch considering how much of a jock he was.For a feel-good movie, this one hits the spot. At the end of the movie, I had a big smile on my face.Definitely recommend it."
2,Not my style,"I do love everything Austin, but this movie was, to me confusing and most of the charactors lacked appeal."
5,"Love it, not the quintisential chick flick","I bought this thinking, ""Chick flick, probably too cheesy."" I LOVE this movie. It is not your typical chick flick, it is a well written exploration of the lives of women."
4,Delightful story,"The Jane Austen Book Club DVD is a delightful, feel good story, but only if you're familiar with Jane Austen's writing. Otherwise, you'd not understand half of what it was about. Fortunately, I know most of Austen's books almost by heart, so it was right up my alley. In fact, I'm thinking of starting a classics book club which will, of course, include the writings of Jane Austen.The ending is a bit contrived with everyone living happily ever after, but Austen certainly would have approved of that."
2,Unfortunate....,"How sad I am to report being so disapointed in this movie with such a great title and such huge potential. The story plot is weak and predictable, the acting slow and you find yourself wanting to shout: move on!! Sadly not worth the efforts. Great bus/hospital or plane movie, but 3/10 says it all.For overseas customers like myself, my DVD arrived in great time, but in a poor condition. The disc came loose from its poor casing and got badly scratched. Think twice about ordering without asking for the DVD od CD to be made 100% secure."
5,LUXURY TOYS,"I was very happy with the book. But, Amazon takes too long to ship products. It arrived several days after I expected it and therefore missed Valentines day. I just ordered some perfume through amazon March 3, it shipped on March 7 and not scheduled to deliver until March 20. I order lots of itmes on line and Amazon is the slowest vendor ."
5,Favorite books passed down and down,"These simple board books by Helen Oxenbury are great. The little ones who are learning the names of things love them. I purchased them for a grandchild, who loved them so much that when she outgrew them, they were saved for the next baby in the family. They were so loved that they were loved to death. I finally replaced them for grandchild number 4. When the new ones came, the 2 year old sat down with his baby brother, to ""read"" them to him."
4,Encouraging Words,Great book! Very practical teaching for zen practice. I would recomend it to anyone learning zen.
5,great book,"Although this book was boring at first, it became one of my favorite books at the end. I always seemed to be waiting for something exciting to happen, but I still give this book 5 stars. The fact that most of this story was true brought chills to my body, for what a terrible story Mary (main character) has. Through her journal entries you get to know her so much that when you finish the book you feel like you have known her all your life. After finishing the book with an almost ""cliffhanger"" ending, I can't wait to read the sequel ""Sorceress"" although I hear it is not as good. Anyone who likes to read about witchcraft would love this book, and it has made me more interested in the topic as well. I recomend this book for ages 12 and up."
4,"""Witch Child"" is an AMAZING book!","I read the first 41 pages of ""Witch Child"" in my World History class (we were watching a boring movie). I could only get through the first 41 pages because the book belonged to my friend. I could barely part with it, due to the fact that I was in love with what I had read so far. That night, I went to the book store and picked ""Witch Child"" up. I read the rest of the book in 4 hours the next day. I has so captivated by Mary and her story. The way she saw people, how she talked about them, and the fear that something bad was going to happen to her was very addicting, and I just couldn't bare to put the book down. After reading the book from cover to cover, I am anticipating the sequel, even though I don't know when it is supposed to be released...If you want an amazing story of a young girl who has to hide what she really is, and deal with the fear of the truth, PICK THIS BOOK UP! I HIGHLY recomend it!"
4,Fiction & Folklore,"Witch Child is a 'junior' read, but very entertaining. This has been on my list for years, and was not a dissappointment. Written as a diary, 14 yr old Mary leaves her home after her grandmother is hung for being a witch, and travels to the New World in the 1600s to start life anew with a woman she has never met.Their travel is long upon a boat, and her she starts to discover her true talents as a witch; and the struggle to keep her identity a secret.In the New World her struggle grows to hide her secrets and her relationship that develops with the Native Americans. And ultimately, she is blamed for situations she did not committ.This book is an easy read, in journal form, and is very entertaining and heart wrenching.I reccommend to anyone who enjoy's reading witchcraft-lore & fiction combined."
4,A GRRRREEAT BOOK!!! MUST READ!!!!!,"This book is very suspensing after a girl flees from the English witch hunts. I loved this book because I never knew what was around the corner. Surprises were popping up everywhere! And this book is actually based on a true story! The story could get a bit dull. But for fantasy frantic readers, this book is a treat!"
3,An interesting story but not classic Graham Greene,"The author states in the preface that ""The Third Man"" was never written to be read but only to be seen"" which perhaps explains the sketchy treatment of characters throughout the story.At times I was confused by the various people in the book and had to reread some pages.The storyline was interesting and quite exciting and I look forward to seeing the film. The other story in the book,""The Fallen Idol"",is only 30 pages long but Greene manages to convey a sinister atmosphere and great depth of characters-a very enjoyable story."
4,slayer is great,"they did it yet again. slayer has turned oput a a great album. i have teh 4 disk set the the slbum but it is plenty good enought for me, the stufff never seen or heard is very good. you can really see how much they have improved since the first album, their sound chancef but the sound of slayer stayed the same. the riffs and drums have changed so much but they are still as hardcore as before. i really enjoyed it."
2,Long Island Guy is Right!!!,"I agree with the reviewer from Long Island. That's a mighty steep proce to pay for stuff I already have with the exception of the live stuff. I'm holding out for a bit on this one, maybe the live CD will be released by itself at a later time. It happened with the Iced Earth box set. One CD has a bunch of cover tunes but I didn't want to buy something I basically already owned. So I waited and not long after the covers CD was released so I bought it then.Slayer is a great band, but not worth that kind of cash for stuff I already own."
4,"Great 4 disc version, nice addition to a thrasher's collection.","This is a great streamlined version of the 5 disc version released at the same time, minus the second live CD. This comes in an excellent CD sized case with great artwork and 3 CD's + Live DVD. This has all the hits heavy throught the post reign in blood years, plus a few from the past. The DVD gives you a great chance to see and be reminded of what a metal show should be like (War at the Warfield!!!). The live show is not as great as Still Reigning, but is good. This is an easy addition to a slayer fan's collection, or a first time buyer looking at a good value and quick fix to bolster their collection fast with all the important tunes. I prefer the five disc version because I am a big collector, and the extra live tracks I find necessary for completion to my collection, but this is no slouch, and the price is right and I highly reccommend this."
4,Slayer will always RULE ALL,"This box set is the best thing i EVER saw for a fan.Its a collection of all there best songs from every cd.The cd wich contains unreleased and japan only tracks areall most worth it alone but with the HUGE booklet that spans overthere whole career is just awsom. The floppy blood filledcd case is cool and the wall banner is nice, butthe live dvd is Very good. Overall this is the best thing a fan could ask and for none fans looking to get into slayer this is the most perfect thing you could ask for the only reasoni gave it 4 stars is the 100.00 price tag, yes itsi big number but its very worth itp.s. for you idiots SLAYER IS NOT DEATH METAL"
2,"Great Booklet, Lousy Box","The booklet is quite good, but, Christ, even the new Neil Diamond Box my Mum got recently is half the price. This is a really poor effort on their part [Please don't tell me they aren't involved with the creation of this]. Why is it so hard for a good box set to come out now? It is as bad of a joke as the Judas Priest Electric Eye DVD having the pathetic ""Priest...Live"" concert rather than the classic 1982 concert from the Screaming tour on it. I agree with prior reviewers: I have seen them since 1986 and wanted more of a reach if this is supposed to be a collection of rare stuff spanning their career; if you disagree with that statement, you don't understand the concept of box sets and are probably one of the morons yelling on the War at the Warfield DVD"
2,VHS tape only played a quarter of the way,Received the sealed tape from the seller but it only played about a quarter of the way through before it stopped. Tried to make it work (and other old VHS tapes were fine) but for some reason this tape did not work.
2,Upper class indulgence,it seems that rececca relied too much on the help of her mother and her husband and frankly I feel her approach was too self serving. Not too inspirational. She never wanted to be many faceted but seems to have remained focused on making money.
5,"The V4 makes you feel like your on the road, it's great.","Force Feedback in that past has always come at a steep price, I've seen wheels for $50-$100 more that don't feel as good as this one. It's easy to program and the customer support people really know how to step you through any rough spots or questions that you might have. If I could rate this product higher I would, but without a doubt, take it from me, there isn't a better product like it for the price anywhere."
5,"A great way to go ""green""","I saw this at a friends house and had to get my own copy. Since I now have room for a garden I planted a variety of peppers and used the suggestions to pick and preserve my own. Now I can make salsa, pickled peppers, etc. saves money and the good for the environment. Even the ""week-end"" gardener will find this helpful."
5,His masterwork,For me RX5 is the best Alvin Lee solo album. It's no blues album but a mix of excellent Mainstream Rock. The Songwriting has never been better. His guitarwork is great and very emotional. It's an album that wins the more often you listen to it. It's a pity that it was never a commercial success. Alvin Lee tried very hard to produce a hit album. His old fans were disappointed because his blues roots were hardly to hear.
2,A great work of art that implodes upon itself,"I served in the same mission as the author and couldn't put this book down. The arc of the story and the artful portrayal of missionary life in this fascinating place are nothing short of masterful and possess universal appeal. That is, until the last chapter, when the story descends into banality. Here the tale twists itself into fake spirituality that is engineered to appeal to brainwashed mormons. As the great nazi filmmaker Leni Reifenstahl showed us, there is a fine line between true art and propaganda."
5,Gold Warriors: Why the POWs in Asia were Betrayed!,"In 1947, Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered the immediate termination of all investigations of Japanese war crimes and the immediate suspension of the arrest of any suspected war criminals.In June 2000, Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah) said, ""You mean our federal government can just say, 'To hell with you, Bataan Death Marchers, and you people who were mistreated (by the Japanese), we are just going to waive all your rights.'""As disturbing and painful as it may be to read, this is a book all victims of the Japanese, and their next of kins, must read. It's documentation and research is beyond reproach. For many of us, this book will be our 'fall from innocence', if that is still possible.Fred BaldassarreSon of a Bataan Survivor"
4,Decent,"Decent album by DJ Hardware. Not as good as some of his other ones, but nevertheless, a must have if you like his type of sounds."
2,Character assassination,"While providing an interesting behind-the-scenes glimpse at Herzog's truly stupendous films, this amounts to little more than a sustained attack on Kinski. Perhaps Kinski deserves it, but Herzog constantly pushes anyone who says anything nice about Kinksi (which is most of those interviewed) to say something negative about him, usually trying to remind them of some horriffic episode or another. This gets trying in a hurry. Perhaps the greatest display of pathology here are Herzog's transparent attempts to smear someone held in affectionate regard by people he worked with."
5,my most favorite album of all times,"Stumbled across this in Amazon. if you are into groovy electronic jazz, then this would be it."
2,Genetics book,I haven't used the book yet but I was really unsatisfied with the price I paid for the book when I opened it up and saw that pretty much every page was highlighted with a million different colors. This book was only about 20 dollars less than what it would cost brand new so i was disapointed that i didn't just buy it from my school.
2,Just so-so,"My Hoover Windunnel bagless worked fine for a few months. When I bought it I also bought the extended service agreement for $50 because I'd read that they didn't have a good repair record. It was a wise investment. I needed it after a year.To keep suction, you have to empty the canister each time and clean off the filter. This is a time consuming and dirty process. It loses suction quickly when the filter gets clogged. Thank goodness for the self propelled option. It's heavy and not easy to push without it. It's also very loud.It doesn't do bare floors well at all unless you use the hose and floor attachment. By just using the upright, the small rock particles are thrown by the brush to other areas of the floor and if the filter is plugged, it won't pick them up anyway.I will say that it worked pretty well in the beginning. I liked having the hose and all the attachments at my fingertips. The compartment keeps them handy and they don't fall out while vacuuming."
4,The final words and journey of Bob Flanagan,"Bob Flanagan spent his entire life dying: he was born with cystic fibrosis in 1952. Most individuals with this disease of the lungs don't make it out of childhood, but with a combination of strength, humor and a bit of S&M, Flanagan survived to be 43, almost unheard of even in this medical age. This book is literally a diary he kept during the last year of his life. Best known as the subject of ""Bob Flanagan: Supermasochist"", there isn't much kink or S/M in this. This is a man dealing with mortality, reviewing his past life, trying to accomplish all he has set out for himself before he is gone. At that same time that this journal was being written, a documentary was being made, which would eventually be called ""Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan"" and it won the Sundance Special Grand Prize in 1997. This journal is an excellent companion to the film, and a final view of the man in his own words."
4,A beginner...,"I write this review from the perspective of an extreme novice of the genre. I actually listened to this CD at a Borders and was absolutely taken in (especially by the infectious beat and tempo of the first track). I had been inspired to check it out by the popularity of Buena Vista Social Club and actually found myself enjoying this CD more. At the most basic level, I enjoy the range of songs on this album and the incredible musicianship. Going beyond this, it seemed to me to be a good introduction (in part because of the range of songs but also because of the range of musicians) and I feel like I have already learned a lot. I cannot comment, obviously, in reference to other artists or albums in this genre, but I can assert unequivocally how much I ENJOY this album. It has worn very well and I suspect will give me a great deal of upbeat listening pleasure for a long time to come."
2,Bad quality,Too bad that I didn't read the review of this product before I bought. The size is smaller than described and it's not handmade. will not buy anything from Greenland again.
1,Repair costs for warranty items.,"I purhcased this light March 2005 to use as a task light while family watched tv. The light was too bright for this use so the light went into an unused corner for 8 months.I used the Ott light one time for 6 hours on a project. The next morning the light would not turn on. Bought a new bulb (very expensive by the way) the new bulb did not work either. Called Ott Light and we decided to try a new transformer. They sent me one at no cost but that did not work either. I had to ship the light back to Florida at my own expense for warranty work and pay Ott to ship it back. So now I have spent an extra 30% over and above the cost of the lamp for warranty work.I will never purchase another Ott light. If it goes out again, I will rewire the light to work on regular light bulbs."
5,Dated now but still a gem,"Reading this book in the Queen's Golden Jubilee Year is a little spooky in some respects. But even though the British Royal Family's circumstances have moved rather during the ten years since ""The Queen and I"" was written, and three of the characters portrayed here are no longer living, Sue Townsend's send-up of the British political scene and the nation's best-loved family remains a poignantly funny read.To really appreciate the genius of Ms Townsend's satire you will need to have at least a passing knowledge of British Royals and some of the scandals that dogged them in the early 1990s. Even without that knowledge, though, many parts of this book should have you helpless with laughter. It is all very silly and stereotyped, of course, but that just makes it all so much the funnier!"
3,Nice...not more.,"When I started to read this book I didn't know what to expect but while reading I was surprised that the book really had some funny moments (for instance ""a bonk a day keeps the doctor away."") and that the writer creatively combined a more serious matter (the royal family) with imagination and humour.But unfortunately, this creative work abruptly ends when you hit the end of the book and wonder why you have spend all that time reading this book when it ends in a way as if a young child made it up. I thought that this story would end in a more surprising way. Some readers might think that the ending is surprising but I think it's not creative enough in comparison to the content of the whole book. Because the book takes you on a (rather long trip) and when it you close the book in the end you might feel a bit unsatisfied."
1,Disappointed,"I have no idea what the product is like; I never received it because my order was cancelled due to ""an error in your inventory.""I ordered it from someone else.Karen Crowley"
2,Smells like fart.,"When i got this candle i was very excited, but when i lit it, it seemed to make a scent that strongly smelled of fart. When i put it out, the fart smell went away."
2,NOT GREAT!,AROMA EXTREMELY WEAK. MORE PACKAGE THAN PRODUCT SUBSTANCE.SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING IN VIEW OF THE PRICE. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. A POOR VALUE.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
1,Read this before you purchase!,This is just a tiny blank sketchbook. The paper isn't even artist quality! It isn't even an OFFICIAL Miss Van liscened piece of merchandise!...Just a bookcover(a thin sheet of paper by the way) printed with a close-up of a Miss Van piece wrapped around a sketchbook If you want an official book go to her website.
1,The Trouble With Harry,I bought this video in good faith and when I received it I discovered it could not be played in the USA. It is set up for (PAL) European region. After contacting the seller they said they don't consider region issues a defect. These people from MovieMars are crooks and I suggest everyone stay well away from them.
5,Charming Hitchcock Humor,"This was an uncharacteristic Hitchcock venture into humor, albeit still in keeping with his penchant for mystery. It was Shirley MacLean‚Äôs first venture into cinema; and she was delightful! This is a fun movie; one that can be enjoyed many times!"
5,Hitchcock's Funniest Murder Mystery,"This is one of my favorite murder mysteries. It is a leasurely comedic romp that builds to the expected but unusual Hitchcock twist. Shirley MacLaine in one of her first starring roles is marvelous but it's the character actors, especially Edmund Gwenn, who steal the show...Also look for Jerry Mathers (The Beaver). Curl up with the buttered popcorn and enjoy the laughs along with the mayhem."
3,"Not a ""showstopper"", but so what?","Do yourself a favor and pour a nice glass of iced tea, put your feet up, and enjoy ""The Trouble With Harry"" on a lazy Saturday afternoon prior to going out to enjoy the centerpiece activity of your Saturday night. In other words, if you don't expect too much from this film, you'll find it enjoyable and diverting. I liked the gorgeous scenery and wonderful photography; the offbeat humor; and the none-too-realistic but amusing characters (many of whom reminded me of the done-with-a-straight-face neurotics that began popping up in Monty Python sketches a decade and a half later). The movie isn't a showstopper (it doesn't have those three or four stare-in-awe directorial moments that mostly every other Hitchcock film offers) but ""The Trouble With Harry"" is beautiful to look at, laced with several chuckles, and, if not directed in the master's usually gripping style, is certainly presented with supreme polish and artistry."
4,trouble with harry,"great funny old film..not the usual by hitchcok. slow moving by todays standards. great to see how the people get together, at first for own interest then for each other."
5,Definitely a Ten,"I love this album, it's definitely worth taking a listen to... ""Come Sei Bella"" and ""Pensa Ancora A Me"" are beautiful songs, while ""Torna"" and ""Perdutamente"" are catchy songs that are upbeat and easy to move to. Massimo has a great voice and I know I could listen to it over and over and never get bored with it:)"
5,Best Cookies ever!,"I ordered a couple different cookies from Scott's Cakes. I loved every single one of them. The are homemade for sure, none are the same size, or look exactly the same, so you can pass them off as if you baked all day. I ate so many cookies, I should have been sick! They were so moist, and delicious. I will order from Scott's from now on."
5,Five Stars Album,I recommend this album to everyone.It is a wonderful CD.I have NovaMenco first CD Gypsy Fusion and I just bought the newest album Fortune Teller released 2002.I love it.
5,Shadow of Doubt,Good Alfred movie. I like the oldies but goodies. You can always find them on Amazon!!!
3,A bit slow,"I know this is a highly regarded Hitchcock movie and like many they build slowly, so patience is required to appreciate many of his films. Shadow of a Doubt was just a bit too slow for my tastes. I found the plot and the story a bit dull and the villain was annoying. The town and cast of other characters helped offset what it lacked elsewhere."
5,Hitchcock at his best,"Alfred Hitchcock has made a load of fantastic films. The Birds, Psycho, Frenzy, and more. But this one took you in under your wing, and then kicked you out in the cold. I give it 5 stars because of it's great content and just because... I love ANY Hitchcock film!"
1,Disappointment!!!!!,I ordered this product in plenty of time for Christmas... kept trying to track package and there was nothing...called company and they told me that it was on backorder and not available until after January 8th...asked why they didn't let me know..no explanation...I cancelled the order....communications not good at all....
2,Some Boys Do,"Poor acting. If I would want to see it again, no once was enough.... Would not recommend this movie. Only one good looking guy, very disapointing."
3,It would be a 5 if it weren't for the rocks.,"I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste. This is the best tasting flax I have ever had. BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds. I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole. Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident. I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture. Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag."
4,"flax seed, recommended brand",The flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook I purchased. This seed was cheaper than other brands I had checked on. I am putting it away for any emergency that may arise.
1,BAD! BAD! BAD.!,I orderrd this film as soon as I saw it was available I saw it on TV and was impressed with the story and the acting. I waited nearly three months for it and just received it. I was sooo disappointed with it. It has NO Menue. No flim insert on the inside of the case. And you are unable to get rid of the subtitles even with the english version. Even working the setup on the dvd player you cannot get rid of the Chinnese subtitles. It greatly disturbes me to have to have subtitles when there is no english version and have to watch a film but to have an english version and have to endure subtitles it throughly unacceptable. BAD! BAD! BAD!
2,should have released all of the songs from the Carousel show,"had Bruce released all 11 of the songs from the show instead of just 5, this would have been a more worthy re-release."
2,SEX SEX SEX,"This lurid, sex-gorged nudy has nothing to do with the Nicolas Cage thriller; instead it's more a soft porn peep show. The characters who are not likeable in the least do stupid thing after stupid thing, and what's worse, seem bored doing it. Johnathon Schaech and Lori Heuring, who are usually adept in their performances, are tepid and listless in this inane story about an aspiring politician, his nympho wife and a threesome that gets them into all sorts of trouble. Poor Bruce Davison who is so good in KINGDOM HOSPITAL is lost in the role of Heurings judicial aspiring father, and the twist ending is unresolved so we've actually had no reason to want anything good to happen to anyone. A waste of celluloid."
5,He knows his stuff.,I just took a SMS training class with the author. He knows his stuff. Buy this book.
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would reveal some Muay Thai ""katas"". When I think of Kata I think of art, of tradition, and pictured the ""kata"" done in the opening on Ong Bak by Tony Jaa. That was not what I got.Basically, they have taken all the basic techniques, jab, cross, elbow, knee, kick, etc.. and put them together in some combination sorted by difficulty. Unfortunately, they don't look very artistic- there isn't much movement or stances, not much flow, no additional traditional movements such as you might find in a Karate or Taekwondo form, just really really basic stuff (but solid)- like shadowboxing. It did not look anything like a traditional kata. Maybe my expectations were unfounded, but that is not what I was hoping to see. If you are looking for some combinations, then the DVD shows that, and gets the job done. It is rather short and could have been done better, but its ""OK"". The 1 star review someone left is just ridiculous."
1,"""muay thai""",For those of you looking for the artistic traditional side of fighting you're mistaking muay thai with muay boran and as for the artistic side those are only taught by instructors those are called wai krus or however you spell it this video just teaches fundamentals but you cannot learn how to fight properly by watching a video on repeat.
2,Not Worth It,"I can't say I expected much with the price, but it was so dull it could barely cut into a tomato. I knew it wouldn't hold up to the name, but I was hoping that it would at least cut as much as a regular knife. Pass this one up people."
3,"Emphasis on money, bankruptcy, etc.","Too much entanglement on issues scuh as bankruptcy for the lay reader. Might be more interesting for business people or finance oriented lawyers.Hard to take as well is Eugenie's undying love for a cousin she kissed once, who doesn't care about her and even marries another womam for mercenary reasons.Balzac is a key figure in literary history (realism), but would not consider a literary giant.I liked *Pere Goirot* much better."
2,Fraudulent author's name on Eugenie Grandet,"Balzac's Eugenie Grandet cannot be spoiled, but the copy that I am reviewing is utterly spoiled by putting a womans's name on the cover where Balzac's name should be. Not one sniff of credit to Balzac any where on the cover! What has publishing come to? Had I known this before ordering, I would have found another copy of the book to buy.It's a wonderful book, but look for a different copy where the publisher at least acknowledges Balzac on the cover."
1,Unhelpful,"As a Perl neophyte, the book was totally unhelpful. It did not describe clearly the most basic functions a new user would want to know like reading a file, parsing it, matching patterns, etc. Look elsewhere."
1,Not for Beginners,"I found this book very frustrating. The format is that you read and then maybe at the end of the chapter there is an exercise and some activities that I don't know what they have to do with the reading material. Perhaps for those who have experience in C++ or some other language it would work but I have had a little Visual Basic and am not very experienced in programming and this does not do for me what I need in a book and what it claims to do, take me from scratch, assuming I know nothing and building on that. There are too many steps that are skipped. Also there are typos. Notice that he misspelled ""sherbet"" as ""sherbert"" ""Sherbet"" is often misprounouced it doesn't rhyme with ""herbert"" and a supposedly educated man should not make that error."
4,Riveting,"A friend gave me this book. I started reading it one night when I couldn't sleep, and before I knew it I was half way through it. My Mother's Keeper was simply fascinating. Reading about BD's travels and adventures was interesting in itself (she did more by the time she was 16 than most people do in their entire lives), but the startling revelations about Bette Davis' mental disorder and its effects on her family made this a book you couldn't put down. The frank portrayal of Davis' bizarre behavior created a dark, tense mood, kind of like watching a horror movie. I always thought I had a bad childhood (probably a lot of people do) but I really feel for BD and what she had to endure."
1,"Sad, Cruel and Self-Serving","When I read ""Mommie Dearest"" years ago it had the ring of truth to me. In today's terms, Joan Crawford would most likely be diagnosed as having Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The behavior described by Christina Crawford is telling. I had not so different a childhood, and I know that only someone who had been immersed in that awful Alice in Wonderland world of dysfunction could recognize the truth of it. BD, in my opinion, is also a narcissist - self-absorbed, unable to relate to real feeling, unable to empathize, and utterly convinced that the universe was created just for her. One of her biggest complaints against her mother was that she raised her personally - always taking her to sets and locations. She planned surprise parties and other delights for her child and always made sure she had the best. Ms. Davis, cruel as she was, sought to give her daughter every advantage, cushion every blow, and shower her daughter with love and affection - WHAT a Bitch!"
5,Why Ralphie Gets Five Stars,Ralphie gets five stars because:Star 1 - It's a funny book. Like when he took the egg to the stork.Star 2 - It's a cute book. When the baby alligator hatches.Star 3 - It's a nice plot.Star 4 - She uses good words.Star 5 - It has a nice ending.
1,Recording is Live,"This is a live recording--but that fact is not stated anywhere on the jacket, the CDs, the booklet, or indeed on the Amazon page for this product. Unfortunately, the fact is made painfully obvious by the obligatory audience participation (coughing and shuffling in the background).The performance itself is mediocre and would have deserved three stars if the product had been correctly described as recorded live."
1,Did Not Work,The card did not work but e-mailed sellers got feed back in less than 3 hours. They refunded cost plus shipping. Thank for making a bad problem go away.
3,how many,how many come in a package? is this a single ring or a twin pack. i just bought a nikon prostaff scope to mount on my ruger american and need some solid scope rings
3,Solid rings but horrible hardware!,"They are nice rings but when torquing the bolt down to the required in/lb the bolt snapped in half inside to body of the ring. Rendering that one useless, so thats why it only got a 3 star besides that very solid."
5,G-G-G-G-REAT!,"Was that a good movie or what! An all star cast: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson. Great Acting, exciting, and a little scary. If you like sci-fi, you'll love this movie! A bit of addvice though...Don't read the book first if you haven't all ready. Its good but the movie just won't be the same. The movie will leave you hoping for a seuquel. Pay close attention...It can get conffusing. In short...awsome movie, see it!"
2,Could have been much better....,"After watching this movie I had a big feeling of deja-vu. The whole idea behind the movie is just a copy of the excellent 50's movie ""Forbidden Planet"", but much worse... Te first 1/2 hour - 45 minutes are OK since you keep wondering about what these guys are going to find inside the space ship, after that everything goes down the drain with a much too cheesy ending... Only recommended for hard core science fiction fans. If is not the case you will bet much better off watching Forbidden Planet"
2,"DVD 5,Special Effects 5, Plot 4, Movie 2!!","This movie starts off with an extremely fascinating plot: a vessel has been located 1000 feet down on the ocean floor; its very large - a fin alone is 100 feet tall; it has a perfect sphere inside.These items alone would give any competent film-maker the necessary material for a very good movie. Not-so the makers of Sphere.A great deal of the movie is spent dazzling the viewer with very good special-effects. An equal amount of time should have been spent including many of the dialogues, from Crichton's book, the crew has with the alien intelligence. As it is, the movie does drag. As compensation, of a sort, I did learn a lot about the toxic properties of marine life on the ocean floor, and thats worth something!The DVD picture is beautifully clear, and the 6 (uh...5.1) channels of digital sound will put your home-theater system, and your neighbors, through their paces.For a Science-fiction fanatic like myself it was okay. It should have been Great!! END"
1,SKIP IT!,THIS MOVIE HAD TO BE THE ALL TIME WORST SCI-FI MOVIE EVER......IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE COMING YOUR WAY......RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!!!!! DON'T BUY IT...DON'T RENT IT......JUST SKIP IT!!!!!!!!
2,This movie had potential but...,This movie was very interesting in the beginning yet the end was a great disapointment; almost like the author couldn't think of a creative ending. Don't waste your time by seeing this movie.
2,What a waste.,"Not even the acting of Clemens, Stone and Hoffman could save this film. It was too frustrating to watch even after finding out towards the end what it meant. They might as well have all been stoned which would have made more sense about all those hallucinations."
1,Quite Bad ...,"It's horrible that they pumped so much effort into the budget of this movie, hired a terrific cast, promoted it like crazy, and never thought to do something as little as write the script.I've never seen a cast with so much talent be wasted so completely just because there was nothing for them to do. I remember watching a scene where Samuel L. Jackson was reading, I was so bored I was actually envious that he had something to flip through ...Don't waste your time with this. If you really want to see it that bad, make sure you at least rent it first; and if you do, don't forget a magazine to keep you busy with."
1,Doesn't even compare to the book!,"This movie is terrible and like a lot of movies, it doesn't even compare to the book. Don't waste your time."
1,129 minutes of fidgeting on the sofa from sheer boredom,"An extremely long drawn out story with everything happening in the last few chapters. I bought this DVD expecting something close to 'Alien'. Sadly to say, it was a waste of cash. Anybody wanna swop out there !?"
2,MOVIE STARTS STRONG THAN LOSES IT IN THE END.,"Hoffman, Stone and Jackson look so out of place in this SCI FI thriller taking place where else but space. The plot is very confusing until the end. Overall the movie has a excellent moral message for us human beings on how we live our lives more negative than positive, but the movie drowns out into a bore. I say give this one a miss. The only reason for watching it is Sharon Stones haircut and tan....She looks fabulous in this pic."
2,Glad I got it free...,"I recevied this DVD through a promotional offer (5 free discs with my DVD player) and I am so glad I didn't pay for it. Dustin Hoffman is just annoying, the script has so many holes you could use it to pan for gold, the special effects are average (at best)... The ONLY thing that made this worth watching was that the underwater sequences sounded awesome in 5.1 surround."
2,"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.","While much of the movie was technically proficient in many ways, the problem was that no one really cared. The actors seemed intent on hamming up as much as they could, especially in the sequences where they were required to 'blue screen' it. Hoffman pointing at what appears to be a 30 foot pulsating ball and says ""look!"" as if the other people can't see. (of course they can't as it's just a blue screen, but we, the audience shouldn't have to figure this out. Essentially ALL and I do mean ALL of the plot points and twists are covered with the trailer. If you've seen the trailer then basically that's the entire movie. The only exception being the end, where the cast, muchlike the audience wishes that they forget all that's happened and lose their memories. No such luck for those who have seen this movie though."
2,don't waste your money,Bad movie off a bad book this film would never have made it if it wasnt a Chrichton novel. This movie is a waste of a lot of talented actors. Shame on you Dustin!!!!!
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???,"I, like most teenage boys in America, went through a certain stage in my teen years. It is an icky developmental thing that few people like to talk about. It may really be better left behind closed doors.Still, I find myself oddly compelled to share this shameful part of my youth in a public setting:Once upon a time, I too read a lot of Michael Crichton.Of his somewhat vacuous oeuvre, I always thought that Sphere would make the best movie. Unfortunately, most movies come from Hollywood--and we all know where the heads of most Hollywood executives spend most of their time.Samuel Jackson? Maybe.But Dustbin Hoffman??? Sharon Stone?????Oy Vey.I'd rather watch Congo. At least it had Laura Linney to look at.This movie is trash--and in this case (as compared to Crichton's novels) I am using that word in a bad sense.Don't waste your time."
4,HELLO. MY NAME IS JERRY.,"An all-star cast is tasked with investigating what appears to be an alien space craft on the ocean's bottom. This is not your ordinary man meets alien type of movie. In fact the ""alien"" is never really well established. The movie, while it has a sci-fi background is more of a psychological mystery. If your science fiction expectation for aliens and gadgets are not too high, this is an enjoyable film, a more cerebral science fiction.There are no creepy aliens, no f-bombs, no sex, no nudity."
2,Should have been better,"This movie had most of the ingredients for a great psychological sci-fi thriller - an interesting plot, good cast, and decent special effects (the Blu-ray transfer looks excellent).Unfortunately, it fails to deliver, mainly due to a poor screenplay.The characters never fully form or connect emotionally, and the dialog doesn't help. The authority figure played by Peter Coyote suffers the worst.The end of the movie is flaccid and actually kind of funny.A more successful movie in the same vein wasSolaris."
2,Disappointing,"Here's a great concept: a space ship is found under water that crashed here about 300 years ago. More to the great concept: the space ship is one of ours from our future. It came from our future and crashed back to earth in their and our past. Or you could say 300 years ago a space ship crashed on earth, and was discovered now. Think of the possible outcomes, we learn about our future and whatever possible disasters that will happen, alien encounters, how advanced we become, whatever. What we get is a boring Sphere. It has an effect on everyone making them paronoid and hallucinating, who cares. The sphere contains a child like entity. It becomes a horror movie. A great cast wasted. I was very disappointed."
4,Awesome Book,"I began reading this book and just couldn't stop. I skipped lunch and read cover to cover. Great read...just as soon as you figure it out, it twists and your left dying to find out the next turn. I didn't know hockey too much but it's not necessary with the really clever layout. Don't miss the sequal...I can't wait..."
4,Mel's Revenge,"The overall story line has been done before, but this script has taken it to a different level. Edge Of Darkness, in my opinion, is underrated; it's classic Mel action and drama; it's well written, with an exceptional supporting cast."
1,terrible,"What a terrible movie. Totally ruined the original BBC TV series. What was this? I can't believe people actually liked this piece of garbage. The acting is terrible, the plot is just awfully bad and apparently re-written in a very confusing way. I advise you to stick with the original TV show. This movie is worth no stars, let alone one star. I just don't know why the director of the movie (Campbell) wanted to re-do his original great work into a crappy movie. I am stunned and disappointed."
1,Disc did not work,We watch the movie about half way through and then it froze. We tried everything to get it to go past scene 13 and nothing. VERY VERY frustrating to watch it to that point and not be able to see the rest. It was a good movie so far too.
1,Horrible movie... Slaughtered and ruined the original TV series,"What a terrible movie. Totally ruined the original BBC TV series. What was this? I can't believe people actually liked this piece of garbage. The acting is terrible, the plot is just awfully bad and apparently re-written in a very confusing way. I advise you to stick with the original TV show. This movie is worth no stars, let alone one star. I just don't know why the director of the movie (Campbell) wanted to re-do his original great work into a movie. I am stunned and disappointed. 0/5"
2,edge of hollywood,"Edge of darkness... AKA where Mel Gibson is right now. In short: bad script, doctrinaire lines, idiot mystery spy supporting role (De Niro walked away from that role while on set...no wonder...with lines like those) and depressing supporting cast. Director relies on shock factor every ten minutes to wake you up. A great concept wasted. Gibson's statement to Hollywood: 'You killed me, but I don't care coz I believe.' That insight the only redeeming factor. And his acting."
4,Cop on a personal mission,"Another 'Cop on a personal mission/vendetta' It's a good story and Mel Gibson plays the 'stressed out cop' part well, he has ever since Lethal Weapon. I really liked it. You sympathize with the good guy and you hate the bad guy, movie success."
2,Do not buy if you're looking for 33 inch seat height.,"The barstool itself is fine, but as for the product description that says the seat height is 33 inches - it's not exactly correct. The seat might be at 33"" when you're not sitting on it, but as soon as you sit on it, it drops about 3 inches due to the hydraulics.Bottom line: If you're looking to buy this barstool for the extra seat height - DO NOT. If you just want a simple, cool looking barstool and not concerned with height - this one works fine."
3,"Good, but itchy","I tried this on a recent plane trip and even though my legs did feel fresher(not by a lot) than usual, these socks made my legs itchier than with normal socks."
1,sent in horrible condition!!!,"These socks are a gift to my dad who's diabetic and when I opened the socks, they looked absolutely AWFUL! They had strings coming off everywhere on them and runs in them! How do you send expensive socks that look so bad? Think twice about getting them from this seller: The Great Canadian Sox Co. Inc.!! It is obvious they are trying to pass off already worn and returned as new. Buyer beware from this company!"
4,Affordable Quality Lighting,"As a home movie maker, this lighting kit does the trick. I own a Sony HDR-HR7 camcorder and it takes more light than I expected to product excellent results. Although, I have only used it for about 30 Minutes, I can say that I am pleased with the results and quality of the product for the price so far. Using this lighting kit produced excellent results. This color saturation is good and the auto focus works well. I recommend this product and would buy from this seller again."
2,not as good as when I buy it from the vet,looks the same but does not perform the same as when I buy it from the vet
4,A good buy!,This keyboard was easy to use and customize. It looks and feels like a normal keyboard but it does so much more.
4,Tight but great anyway,"I ordered my size which is 3x-4x, I admit they were tight at the tummy but they fit my legs great. If you already bought them and you have the same issue then wear them under your tummy and wear a shaper on top. Besides that I love the quality because despite the not quite perfect fit, they didn't break or rip!"
3,The Fortune Teller's Kiss (American Lives),"The book ended abruptly for me. It did not explain how much of a disability the polio left the author with. Also, I felt it was somewhat repetitous in parts."
4,Worth checking out,"I Bought this movie based on a trailer I saw from another DVD. When I first saw the movie I thought it was okay but not great, but at the same time I wasn't dissappointed at my purchase. The second time I saw the movie I loved it. The action isn't spectacular but the story is innovative and the visual effects are awesome (keep in mind the movie came out in 2002), and it is clear to see that this movie was a major influence on the visual effects on the 2007 release of Transformers.This is a great film for any fan of the sci-fi genre"
5,Better than the first Matrix!!!,"At first judgement at the box art, you would think that this was just another dumb ""shoot-em-up"" movie. A movie with a lot of silly action and no story-line.FORTUNEATLY, The Returner is not that kind of movie. It has a very interesting storyline, with two surprising twists at the end that will really shock you. This is a very good quality movie.And yes my review title is correct......its better than the first Matrix!!!"
3,Not great but a fun movie,"This movie certainly has it all I just could have used a little more action.There is a girl who has been sent back through time so that she can save the world from aliens. We learn a lot about the aliens and what the real reason the world is so horrible in the future. We got aliens, wire fu fight, shoutouts, and all kinds fo crazy stuff. Kaneshiro is the main reason to watch this movie. I never thought of him as an action star but that is just because I haven't seen him in too many action movies. This movie really defines who he is, a great actor who can do just about any role. He is just one of the coolest guys you will ever see. Overall a good story and a good action movie.Special features are sweet with an hour long making of and a commentary as a second audio track to the making of with the lead actress and director."
2,Not my idea of fun,"I devoured all eight of the paperback Stephanie Plum series and recommended them to others, so when I was hard up for reading material one evening I picked up ""Full Speed"" from the 24 hour pharmacy. Serves me right for not checking Amazon first. Not only does the story include a computer with fully human abilities despite being set in present time, but the only character they give a Jewish name to is the used car salesman. The protagonist is having a ""very bad day"", and I guess his name is supposed to telegraph how hard it's going to be for her to get a good deal. How offensive is that?As for the quality of the plotting and writing see the other reviews and steer clear."
1,Awful DVD on Noah's Ark,My daughter just called me and said this was the worse childrens DVD story. Hardley any music and it was hard to watch and enjoy for the children. It's all animation and difficult to follow. My grandson has know idea what it is about and he is almost 4. I'm taking him to see the Noah Ark Children's Exhibit this Saturday and was hoping this DVD would help with understanding the story.Sad Nana
5,Superduper!,"Wonderful!I just bought a new truck with black paint. I work and park at a dusty, dirty job so keeping it clean is a priority for me. Just shopping around looking for something easy to use, I bought this at Wal-mart.(I also bought and useMeguiar's G7101 Gold Class Wash Shampoo & Cond.)Wow! It goes on easy and wipes easily to a beautiful shine. No elbow grease required. A full size extended cab truck has a lot of surface area to wax and NanoWax makes it a snap to do in about 30 minutes. If you hustled you could do it in 15 or 20 minutes I think.Makes the windows shine too. Makes the plastic covering the headlights and taillights gleam.Darin"
4,Brown Tie,Nice Brown Tie but wayy too long for a kids neck. If you purchase this make sure you (if you have a small neck) or your kid can tie a double windsor
1,"Not beyond, still in the middle of it","I read introductory books to be informed on a field I am not familiar with: so I expect clarity and relevance. Ward's book is far from that. The Preface, the Introduction and the first chapter are devoted to promise information about a new theory behind everything, but you never get there. Facts, names and theories are put together, but they don't seem to add up to nothing. Where I am able to check, the book in not correct (Beethoven's Eroica is not a late composition).Really disappointing.Not a service to the theories it is meant to support and divulgate.Somewhere, it should be said that this is just the American edition of an English book called ""Universality""."
2,I would not purchase again.,Easy to assemble. Can not handle much weight. The table is not too stable and bends when you attempt to move it with anything heavier than a light weight printer on it.
3,Looks nice,Made of poor material. Don't know how long it will hold up but it looks nice and for the price I guess it is o.k.
4,Good game,"Nice basic horseshoe game that can be played indoors. Kids like it -- well, for about a half-hour or so, then they are on to something else. Nice to have on hand for a rainy day."
5,A superb book by a Turkey-connoisseur,"Congratulations Mr Mango on your very good book. It can be made superb if the double spacing is used to allow easy reading and published more professionally (which deserves it) rather than on an average paperback edition, which does not help the readers' eyes to follow it easily. I have Mango's personal signature in your best-seller on Ataturk. What I like about Mango is his historical (although he doesnot claim to be a hard-core historian) objectivity and his genuinely feeling the Turkish heart-beat since he -having been born in Istanbul- knows Turkish and Turks profoundly. He does not write artificially like some other so-called experts who publish pages of sometimes fancy garbage about Turkey and his populace..."
1,it's just OK,"Actually, for $250.00, I would expect there would be a piece of jewelry from Diana's collection thrown in! Exorbatant pricing for a book that just rehashes the same ole same ole. A lot is pure speculation...but $250.00?????????? What is THAT all about??? Gold lined? Signed by Diana herself? Good book, but not THAT good..have read better for $5.99 !"
4,Early Hitchcock Still Good,Things get going fast in this movie with a war plane plant being flamed and Cummings being framed by a guy that never existed. He keeps going after the truth and meets some strange and also some too suave and friendly people that eventually he ends up following trying to clear his name. Good Hitchcock method ending.
5,Great for leaning out the legs!,I don't know why so many people are concerned with the production quality. I want a good work out that does the trick and this is definately it. I've been working out for years and also played sports in college so I'm very familiar with various types of training. I've been doing this workout 3 times a week for a little over a month now and I can honestly say my legs have never been so lean and my buns so tight. My legs still continue to burn after each workout. I also do P90X 6 days a week which I've done for about a year but my legs never reached the lean size they are now until I began Pure Barre. Definately worth the money and the time!
1,Horrible instruction,"This dvd provided a good burn once I figured out what on earth the instructor was doing. It is filmed very poorly, shot from the wrong angles so that you often have no idea what the instructor is doing. Secondarily, her instructions seem to have little to do with her actions. I was yelling angrily at the screen during the first 30 minutes but noticed when I finished the workout that I felt toned and trembly. A good workout but a terrible production."
3,Enjoyable but Forgettable,"Trapezoid came out with some LPs back in the 70s that developed something of a cult following. When I saw this CD and read the title, I figured I was in for some really folksy music-making, all homespun and rural--imagine my surprise to hear a Kenny G-type saxophone on several of the cuts! It looks as though Trapezoid was trying to bring a traditional musical form into the `90s. Thinking about it, I guess the title is not Old Ways, it is Remembered Ways, and memories are a construct we create in the present, not a literal re-creation of the past. This is personable music, just a little too slick to get me really enthused, but the blending of past and present is interesting to contemplate, making the CD enjoyable to play."
1,Why ?,"This album is inspired by ... ? It is boring, there is no improvisation. It looks like the musicians are just playing for there money, from 9 to five, with there thoughts somewhere else. The only good number is ""Hollywood"", used as a radio tune for a musicprogram in the Netherlands. The rest is, let's say, a waste of time. Maynard's best CD is ""Maynard Ferguson"", 1971, with numbers like Move Over, Stoney End and Living in the Past."
2,"I agree, save your money for Maynard's better side...","""Hollywood"" says it all. Bland and over-comercialized. Maynard did well to seperate from Columbia. If you are looking for Maynard's hottest years I suggest the following: Maynard '71 (now on CD), MF Horn I & II, and Live at Jimmy's (good luck finding it though).-Dan Billington, Wisconsin"
1,Do not buy anything from this seller again ! It is a fraud.,"I did not receive the item I ordered. It is a bad experience.I ordered the book ""life"" from this seller and chose Expedited Shipping.The order status always shows as Shipping Soon even the expected date was over.Contact Seller did not get any response.So, do not buy anything from sarwatomar. It is a fraud."
3,Valerian Root - smells bad - not sure if works,"I took 2 pills last night. I did feel drowsy within the first half hour. I've been having insomnia lately and don't want to take prescription pills for sleeping. I will say that you really have to wash these pills down good. They are a little large and they didn't go down easily for me. I suffer with a nervous stomach and it seemed to help a little with that which I was pleased about, however, I was still up the entire night, like every hour. I may try it one more time to see if it makes a difference, or maybe I should have taken 3 pills like the bottle suggested."
1,Valerian doesn't actually work,"Valerian root only works when it's ""fresh"" root. The capsule version is dried and doesn't capture the essential compounds that make true valerian work. Save your money."
3,Time will tell...,"Maybe it is the brand, maybe I am not taking enough... However not necessarily feeling the relaxation with it. I may have to perhaps up the amount or something. I will start next week. So far I have notice feeling very relaxed before sleep and have a nice sleep. So I will see if adding to the amount I am taking will have any further effect as far as having a more positive outlook and more relaxed less anxious feeling during the day."
3,Not Too Shabby,"Jaws 2 is a film version of the novel by Hank Searls. The movie which is directed by Jeannot Swzwarc. The movie is way ahead of it's time in spcial effects. Back in 1978, they did not have the best of special effects, such as todays. The movie had good special effects, but not too good acting. The actine is almost too fake and the actors do not act realistically enough to believe. the movie, overall is ok, but not the best of movies I have seen. I would not reccomend this movie except to the old school people."
4,"Great Picture, Great Special Features, Okay Sound","I love the picture quality and the special features.But the soundtrack is in Mono, we need a new 5.1 Surround Sound Mix.Watching this movie on my HD Flat Screen TV, I notice the music would fall flat when it was suppose to be powerful. But other than that, this is a solid DVD."
3,Say Ahhhhhhhh,"The first movie ended with a classic line. ""Smile you son-of-a-BOOOOM!"". That line will live forever. However the money hungry, no talent writers of this film thought they could re-create that magic with ""SAY AHHHHH"". Buy Jaws 1 and ignore this abomination. The whole Jaws experience is watching the first film. I'll never put on a life-jacket again!"
3,"A B Movie, and a C sequel.","Set four years after the Amity Beach shark attacks in Jaws one, Jaws 2 is a repeat of the original with a few different creative twists. This time around ""Bruce"" followed in the horror movie villains footsteps like Michael Myers and Leatherface and sought out teenagers for his main coarse. It is definately not as clever and well written as the original, but it is also not a complete and total film disaster. The new restoration is really good on the special edition DVD. If you are a fan of the franchise. If you hate sequals stay away."
5,good,I love movies this one is vary good and love good scare and thrills and this was my favorite moives of all time thank you for sending this to me
4,Excellent Sequel that Screams Seventies!,"Bravo to all involved in this successor to the amazing original... hey, if there had to be a sequel at all, this is as good as it gets... and there is something strangely wonderful about revisiting the island community of Amity and the Brody family. I wish they'd stopped with this one and not gone on to numbers 3 and 4.For those of us who can remember seeing the film in theaters, there is a wonderful nostalgia preserved here...especially with the young cast members. Not only is there a style, a look and a language...but the whole ensemble DISASTER of it all makes one look bak fondly on the generation weaned on Irwin Allen!The DVD extras are fun and informative; JAWS fans will definitely want to include this one in their collection."
3,Do we really need these JAWS sequels?,"Well, Jaws 3 was decent. Jaws: the Revenge was literally a disaster. Jaws 2 . . . well, it's a notch below J3, but it's way better than Revenge. Here, Roy Scheider returns as Chief Brody, who discovers there's another great white shark on the loose. And you guessed it, the shark is terrorizing Amity Island. So this film isn't very enticing as the original (to me, J3 was better than J2), but it still gives good thrills. But try not to laugh at the shark attacking a flying helicopter (VERY stupid to look at).And it's too bad Hooper isn't in this sequel. It would've been more exciting."
3,"The only good sequel in the ""JAWS"" franchise","Once the music starts you know your in for a first class ride of the same caliber and quality as the original. John Williams does an excellent original score for the sequel setting the tone right off the bat. Really has some genuwine, jump outta your seat shocks and is overall very enjoyable and suspensful. Roy Scheider returns as Sherriff Brody and is just as good as he was in the first, sinking his teeth into the role and tearin' it up, much like the title character.If your lookin for a scary shark movie, stick with the best(""JAWS"" and ""JAWS2"") and forget the rest."
1,hmmm,"i borrwoed this cc from a friend and i was waiting for a good song to come on, it never did, so i give this a 1. they could gett better tho."
1,Avoid This Program!,"Save yourself hours of frustration trying to get this buggy program to work -- steer clear of this one! Also, don't believe the 100% customer satisfaction guarantee -- they don't return phone calls. My advice is to check out ""try before you buy"" downloadable trial programs to find something you will like -- and that works!"
5,this book is great,"of all the books i have ever read, this is one of the best i bought it at a little store on nantucket and was able to put it down for two days of straight reading. it's full of unkown facts and itgives the full Sid& Nancy story! Read This Book!!"
5,Must read material for any fan of Rock and Roll,This book is riveting from beginning to end and as detailed as you could want... some times even more detailed than you want. All taken from direct quotes of those who were there at the formation of punk rock the material informs as well as it transports the reader to the times and places.
4,Review For Bestsellers Class...,"I first picked up Please Kill Me, because I wanted something similar to Punk: The Definitive Record of a Revolution, only fewer pictures and more grimy details. I was very impressed not only with the writing style and format of the book, but also with the sheer volume of information that it included. I was expecting a basic ""this band started this date and the original members were so and so and his brother."" kind of thing, and was quite pleased at the details that were included in the book. My favorite part would have to be Sid Vicious singing country songs and crying to himself around Christmas time, you won't find that kind of thing anywhere else. I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning a little more about the true beginnings of ""punk."""
2,Spend Your Time Listening to the Music,"Save yourself the 5 hours and keep Legs from getting more royalties for this gratuitous, self-glorifying collection of interview excerpts. Put on the Stooges' ""Raw Power,"" some early Patti Smith, and anything by the Ramones. That, my friends, is emminently more enjoyable and representative of the formation of punk music than reading this book. Lessons learned from ""Please Kill Me"":1. Iggy Pop was/is a messed up rock god2. Everyone in the late 60's/early 70's ""scene"" was into drugs, bi-sexuality, or both3. See #24. Lou Reed was a jerk5. The MC5 was a great garage rock band that was exploited by the activist community6. Bebe Buell slept with everybody"
4,If you love the Ramones.......,"Bought this book for my daughter, but found that I enjoyed reading it and reminiscing about those 'by-gone days'. Big Ramones fan so was pleased to see lots about them. Good insight on the driving force behind punk. But beware, this is punk exposed, so don't expect sugar and spice and all that's nice.Definitely worth the read."
1,"Richard Grudens, The Spirit of Bob Hope","Grudens, who focuses on celebrities from the 1930s through the 1950s, has written a starry-eyed story about entertainer Hope. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in its puerile descriptions of the man and his accomplishments. Hardly a biography, this book stands as more a puff piece written by an admirer."
4,"Great book, very informative.","I am pleasantly surprised by the readability of this useful book. The book kept my attention, and it was very helpful and informative."
4,Linden Twin Size Headboard/black,Was pleased with my purchase of the Linden twin size headboards. Was just what I expected and easy to assemble. Good price for the furniture.
5,REALLY A GREAT PRINTER AT A GREAT PRICE,"REALLY A GREAT PRINTER FOR THE MONEY. TOP QUALITY AT A LOW END PRODUCT. THANKS, WE REALLY LIKE IT."
1,This is the worst printer ever,"I was surprised to see so many high ratings for this dreadful printer. It was relatively inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. The cartridges for it cost around thirty dollars and then magically dry up in a couple of months, with the printer task bar being completely inaccurate in telling you when they will dry up. The printer itself has a tendency to jam at inopportune times. For some reason unbeknownst to the mortal world, this printer always tries to pull all the pieces of paper in the paper dispensing container and then get jammed. So be prepared to abort print jobs and grab twenty pieces of paper from the printer's maw. Considering how often this happens, it just isn't worth the hassle; do yourself a favor, spend a little more money and get a better printer than this piece."
3,Informative Story,"This book was interesting because I have a small background knowledge on the Boer war, and presents a point of view I am not familiar with. It is short in length and has no dates attached to events described, but is able to give a feel of what it was like being 'on commando' during the different phases of the Boer war. After reading this book I want to learn more about battles such as Spion Kope, the siege of Ladeysmith, General Baden Powell, the Orange Free State and more which were only just touched upon by the writer. All in all, I liked this book."
3,Too Fast Two Wheels?,"Basically The Fast & The Furious on 2 wheels with ICE cube and some young hunky newcomer in a cat & mouse good guy, bad guy kind of yarn. Some totally ridiculous Motorcycle stunts that look as if the director has watched the Matrix trilogy too much. Plenty of hot babes and even hotter bikes and a whisper thin plot carefully woven between the leather clad opposing tribes. Sure to appeal to the 18-24 demographic, but leave the ""is that really possible"" sensibility at home."
1,A LOAD OF TOSH,"This is the worst film ever made. Rubbish acting and a rubbish storyline. Ice Cube should take acting lessons. The producers of the movie should be lined up and stoned to death. How in the name of all that is holy can a script that bad can be made into a movie i don't know. I really hated it. AND THEN SOME! I had to give this movie a one star to get my review in, but it's not worth any stars whatsoever."
2,Possibly the most boring movie with wheels ever made,"Not even as entertaining as Biker Boyz, which was a pretty lame movie in itself. It shows the speedometer's of various riders going very high, but you rarely see any shots where they're actually driving fast. Okey plot, but very stupid dialogue and exaggerated villains and stereotypes.Rent or buy ""Drive"" with Marc Damascas for a good ""high-octane"" movie."
1,Deja Vu all over again,"Didnt I just read all of this in some of the other books in the series?Extreme Programming Installed is the best of the lot. The others just repeat the same information in different ways. No need to read the others in the series. The initial book, ExtremeProgramming Explained is ok. It explains the philosophy. But XP Installed gives actual examples."
5,Patience for the Special Edition DVD,"The Orgazmo Special Edition DVD was due out Dec 30, 2003, but Universal had to push back the release date because they did not have a wide screen version of the movie. But it's still coming, so all we need is a little patience. It WILL be worth the wait. For updates on the status of it, try www.orgazmodvd.com, www.craptv.com or www.crapmag.com or take a look at the forums there to see if it has been discussed recently."
2,From the mind that created South Park...,"comes Orgazmo. And it has the same (ahem) level of sophisticated comedy you might come to expect after watching several episodes of South Park. And it's almost as funny. If you like South Park, Im sure you'll love the story of a Mormon missionary who fights crime with his 'orgasmo' ray while working in the porn industry to save up money for his wedding in Utah. However, if you don't think that's funny, then stay away. That goes double if you actually are a Mormon. While I wouldn't call the film hate-mongering, it's a little mean spirited at times. I give it two stars. One because I laughed a couple of times, and another because that sneaky Trey Parker actually managed to squeeze in a serious message or two about religion and pornography in the middle of all the crude humor."
1,Poorly Done Sexual Humor,I can't believe that anyone thought this movie was any good. I rented the movie based on the great reviews that everyone gave it. I was sorely let down. I found it hard to even finish this piece of garbage. All I can say is don't waste your money on this turkey.
1,Stupid and mean-spirited - hateful,"I thought this movie is really stupid and mean. Seems like these two film directors have it out for anyone who is religous. I would not buy it - seems hateful for the 21st century when we need more tolerance of all people - gay or straight. Also, much of it is not true according to my friend who knows something about mormons. He said the whole premise is ridiculous - it does not cost anything to get married! Not even funny - if you want to see it I would rent it instead of buy it - save yourself a few bucks."
5,orgazmo,"I watched this movie and almost died laughing, I came so close to peeing my pants. I recommend this movie to everyone."
2,"Quick Cam Pro and the ""red Motion blurr"" blues.","I find that the adjustments on the Quick Cam Pro are very precise and if I use the manual mode and reset all the settings in each situation / condition such as lighting, color etc., I can take a pretty good still picture. The video motion however is another story. The speed is such that all movements are jerky and far from real life. This is especially a major irritant when conferencing between our office locations. I thought I could put in an accelerator card to solve the problem but was told that the camera just isn't good enough. I have 11mb or Ram for video at present. I guess I'll be buying another product. NOT a good thing. Another problem is that I have to diconnect the printer from it's port in order to use the camera."
3,An early disaster classic,"The story is set in ""modern"" Europe of the 1960s, with an infected would-be thief who has been exposed to a secretly-developed plague. He is traced to a train, people who are exposed to him become ill, the authorities decide to shunt the train onto an old rail route that has an old, deteriorated bridge (the Cassandra Crossing), in hopes of killing off the infected people, But the people on the train are into the plan and fight guards on the train to make a break for freedom."
3,"A wonderful ""bad"" movie!!","""Cassandra Crossing"" is truly one of the best of the worst. This is a supreme potboiler of the 80's. An amazing array of talent, completely thrown away, giving overblown and tawdry performances, in a script that is laughable at best. BUT - make the popcorn, choose your drug of choice and have a ball!!"
2,A good cure for insomnia!,"This story has been done to death! A potential disaster on a train, heroes and foes. A covert government plot. The usual same old same old. The acting is poor and the suspense is non existant. The outcome is predictable. I'm sorry I wasted my money buting this movie!"
5,Simply Beautiful to Look at,"This quilt book not only offers many quilts to create but it is just fun to look at over and over. The photos are beautifully styled and opens up the imagination to decorate with the quilts. If you are an antique lover, you'll love the use of old items coupled with the new quilts, that take on an old flavor, themselves. I think there is something for everyone in this book, from the new quilter to the very experienced. Directions are clear and I like the graphic layout of the book. I appreciate the flat shots of the actual quilt so I can see the overall process. I want to make every single quilt in this book! Haven't seen a quilt book like that in a long time. This is a top notch, well put together quilt book. Visually and technically superior. Not many out there like this one!"
5,A fascinating who's who of socialist history,"This book presents a history of socialism by reviewing the lives of some of the most prominent socialist leaders. It is full of fascinating biographical details, and as a whole provides real insight into what made socialism so attractive to so many. The conclusion, with its discussion of the Israeli Kibbutz movement and the empty but dazzling appeal of socialist principles, is itself worth the price of the book. Highly recommended."
4,Sunshine in a Bottle!,"TryMe Cajun Sunshine Hot Sauce is a tasty condiment that pairs well with any kind of Creole or Southern dish. It has a mild heat with a vinegary taste that never overpowers, but definitely enhances flavor. I prefer a hotter sauce, so while it's not my personal favorite, it's definitely worth buying."
2,its 1974 and poorly done as to the real Dickens,The 50's version captures the dark gloom of Mrs Labishes Home. Mason plays the escaped Con and shoul have been the Lawyer.
5,Real...enjoyable...honest...something else,"I must admit that I listen to this album almost every day. No, it's NOT WHO'S NEXT or QUADROPHENIA...but it's surely not FACE DANCES or IT'S HARD. Townshend has always been the creative force behind this band. The Kenney Jones records felt quite half-hearted...impacted by Townshend's addiction and subsequent recovery...but reactive to Keith Moon's death. No...Keith and John are gone (and missed terribly), but Pete has perhaps crafted the most honest and heart-felt and consistent record under the Who moniker since Quadrophenia. Bravo...and give it a listen instead of just reading the reviews complaining about this album."
2,you have to be kidding,"It is hard for me to believe that there are great reviews for this cd.I love the Who as as much as the biggest fan does but to say this is a good cd is a total joke.The positive reviews must have been written by blind fans that would give a good review to this band if they would do a remake of' Mary Had A Little Lamb'The music is repetitive and dull.One song starts out exactly like 'Baba O'Reilly' and only gets worse as the song progresses.Loyal fans must learn to give reviews with their ears and minds,not purely from their hearts."
3,"Forget ""The Who"", this is about Townshend!","To parrot what has been written before, this CD has nothing to do with The Who. If you want their last record, buy ""The Who by Numbers,"" if you want their best record, buy ""My Generation"" or ""The Who Sell Out.""This offering is Pete's record, and if you love guitars, Townshend delivers more evidence of his stature as one of the 5 or 6 greatest rock guitarists ever. If you are among the naysayers regarding his abilities, prepare to be converted (of course, if your idea of rock guitar is someone screaming a blues scale over and over, don't waste your time).Buy this for Townshend's guitar!"
2,Am I the only one who doesn't like this album?,"I really was looking forward to this, but anticipated something a little more ""The Who"" like. ""We Got A Hit""? I wouldn't be so sure."
3,Who's Last,"The Who is the greatest rock band of all time! Having said that, this is probably the least impressive album they have ever released. I've listened to the entire CD five times, and only find ""We got a hit"" remotely memorable. I've enjoyed esoteric compilations like Tommy and Quadrophenia, but think the latest Who release is an uninspired marketing opportunity. Disappointing, as these are brilliant musicians."
1,Mess,"I've been a Who fanatic for 30 years. As a fan of all music, old / new, east / west I must say that this CD is just plain difficult to listen to without cringing."
2,The Who - Endless Wire,"Disappointing, all the The Who energy is lacking. There is no spark or continuity, some songs are good though."
4,Pretty musical dress,Bought this dress for my daughter's 5th birthday party. She looked amazing. She still dresses up in it and dances around in the dress. She absolutely loved it! It's so beautiful. We see the Nutcracker every year and she loves the play and music from it. MY only gripe is wishing the music could have some sort of volume control in it.
4,An aeroplane adventure plus a windjammer one,"It is about half way through the book before he actually boards the windjammer; the first bit deals with his adventures on the way to Australia to join the ship. Nevertheless, a good read expecially because the (late) author tells his story frankly and from the heart."
4,Quality,"This is good quality hardware -- very rigid and sturdy. You can easily adjust the horizontal position of your TV by simply sliding it along the nice, shiny, horizontal rods. For vertical adjustment you have to take down the TV, which is as easy as disconnecting all wires (okay, not so easy), release the locks, and lift it off the wall portion, remove the screws holding the wall bracket, reposition the bracket, screw it back to the wall, and put it all back together. I am not complainin', just 'splainin'.The only problems I had were with the supplied cardboard mounting template, which was a little bent, so I gave up trying to use it, and just measured. I switched left and right when attaching the bars to the TV, because there was nothing in the directions indicating that there was a left and right. After mounting on the wall, I couldn't easily operate the tilt locks, so I had to take it back down and switch the bars.After proper installation, it works perfectly. It is easy to change the tilt."
4,On Golden Pond DVD,"This a great classic movie. Unfortunately in the world of HD and DVDs, it's too bad that is has not yet been digitally remastered. You could tell it was an aged piece but it's still a GREAT movie demonstrates a heartfelt, realistic view on aging gracefully and romantically. The scenery(New Hampshire)is be beautiful too...."
5,On Golden Pond,"Wonderful, wonderful movie. Great actors! Really enjoyed it when I saw it when it first came out. Bought it as a gift this time."
5,Classic movie,"This is great movie with star performers. Nice to see the interaction between real-life father and daughter (Fonda) on the screen. Hepburn is wonderful, as always. Good movie for any age."
4,Finally an Oscar to Henry Fonda!,"So many other actors got the (not always so well deserved) Oscar before Henry Fonda got it: why? It's hard to understand it! At least he was not alone: Paul Newman got it towards the end of his illustrious career, Al Pacino got it more than 20 years after ""The Godfather"", Peter O' Toole never got it, Ennio Morricone never got it, Alfred Hitchcock never got it, Orson Welles never got it, Robert Altman never got it, Brian De Palma never got it, Martin Scorsese never got it and probably never will!""On golden pond"" is a very good movie which, perhaps, could have been a little better. But anyway, seing Katharine Hepburn, Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda act all together in a movie...could one wish more than this?"
4,Superb acting by Fonda and Hepburn,"Fonda and Hepburn won Oscars for this movie. This film gave Fonda his only Best Actor Oscar. It is a great story about an old couple who are take care of a teenager while their daughter goes on vacation with the boy's father. The acting is phenomenal, superb, excellent and every other synonym. One should play close attention to the relationship on camera between the characters of Jane (who plays the daughter) and Henry Fonda. Jane Fonda actually bought the rights of the movie so that her father could play the lead. Jane has said that this film help resolve many issues between father and daughter. This movie also marks the first time Hepburn and Henry Fonda worked together. During the movie he wears a hat which belonged to Spencer Tracy. Hepburn did all her won stunts, including the diving into the cold water (she was an adept swimmer). The movie is just great, it is very well acted, it has an amazing story and it is a classic."
5,This Book Made Me So Mad!,"I am officially furious with Bob Moore. As a horror, true crime, and graphic novel fanatic, I am ruined for life! ""Parker's First"" is one of the most terrifying and gruesome novels I have ever read. Other writers now pale in Moore's shadow. As usual, Mr. Moore develops interesting, sympathetic, and believable characters. This time out he tweaks the mix by throwing in a vicious killing machine that would make ""American Psycho's"" and ""Exquisite Coprse's"" monsters blush! This is a powerhouse novel that reads way too quickly. My heart was broken when it was over as I stared at my stack of books-to-read-next. They all looked dull. Really dull. Damn you, Bob Moore! Now what should I read?"
1,Absolutely horrible,This book was an absolute waste of paper and time. It was so badly written - it could only be for people who have nothing better to do with their free time.
5,Only Cheesecake Cookbook You'll Ever Need,This is the first cheesecake cookbook I bought. I found it easy to substitute other ingredients to change the flavor of a given cheescake. My friends think I'm a cheesecake guru and beg me to bring a cheesecake to parties and get togethers. They even offer to purchase the ingredients. I love this book and can't imagine making a cheesecake without it! It easy to make a great cheesecake when the recipes are so easy to follow.
2,"Good recipes, no pics. Disappointed.","This little book of cheesecake recipes is going to China to a young man who has learned to make cheesecakes in a toaster oven. The Chinese do not have or use ovens like ours. I collected three cheesecake recipe books for him. This one was ok for the recipes but there were no pics and that is always a plus I appreciate. If you are from a non dairy culture, pics are a help.Susan"
1,50 Best Cheesecakes,"I did not like the fact that I had no pictures, the printing was small, selections of cheesecakes were not that great."
3,Love Bruce,Love Bruce and I am OK with covers of his songs. The Costello version of Brilliant Disguise is brilliant. Others less brilliant.
4,Good stuff,"This is the first Springsteen tribute album I've enjoyed. The only cover I didn't like was Jason Ringenberg's version of ""My Hometown."" His vocals made me feel like it was about vacationers leaving Martha's Vineyard on Labor Day weekend - definitely not a working class version. Other than that, it was great to hear different takes on some of Springsteen's work. I particularly enjoyed Mike Rimbaud's hopeful take on ""Atlantic City."" I'd recommend this album to Springsteen fans who enjoy hearing his songs performed across a number of genres."
3,"Loved it as a kid, but...","So, when I was a ratty little kid I absolutely loved this movie -- especially the golf cart that appeared in the background from time to time, and the assault vehicle made from a bus that catapulted parachuting turtles.But I tried watching it again a year ago with my brother. I was far from impressed. Now, the movie is not made for adults. But some of the best kid's entertainment -- Star Wars, Sesame Street, Muppets, Neverending Story -- is great for adults. So it really falls flat for adults. But kids will truly love it."
1,Outlandish Characters,"Paul Kidd has a horrible character mix for an otherwise awesome setting. Descent into the Depths of the Earth (Oerth?) was a fascinating setting that set my fellow Dungeon Masters and players on fire for Drow (evil black-skinned elves that dwell in caves and tunnels).Justicar is a fairly good character, but Escalla is just too Roleplaying Gamey with her random powers. She just makes a serious novel a joke, in the worse sense of the term.Polk and Enid are interesting. These characters have some hope.The way that a minor spell tripped up a major god (Thoth) makes a mockery of gods. But maybe that was what Kidd was after.Overall, I say Ru Emerson does a better job of respecting the setting that Paul Kidd. But her characters are far less interesting.RATING: Since I had to give it a star, I did. Otherwise, I would give it no stars."
1,Stay Away from Polaroid,"They are not built to last. The power supply boards won't last more than a year. Even if it's under warranty, customer service is terrible and if you need a part be prepared to wait 2 months. Don't get fooled by the Polaroid name. It doesn't mean reliability."
2,no sound - stay away,After two years sound went out to the TV speakers. Seems main fix is to get a new TV or spend more than the TV is worth. Only cheap fix is to get a home sound system and plug it in to TV. Poor fix if you ask me.
4,A True Mambo Classic,Wished it the music could of been alittle faster pace other then that it was awesome.
4,My favorite hammer,"This is a great hammer with nice balance. I use this hammer for shaping, drawing out and general smithing. I generally use this rounding hammer and a crosspeen hammer for most of my work. Nice hammer."
1,WARNING: This is NOT the Ben Kingsley version!,"I inadvertantly purchased this audiobook, believing it to be the much lauded version narrated by Ben Kingsley. IT IS NOT - don't get the abridged version if you are buying based on the reviews provided here. There's alot missing from this version - and it does not flow like Yoganandas original. Also, the quality is not as good as the $79.00 version. After buying the ""real"" Ben Kingsley narrated version, I can assure you that it is worth the price!"
5,Interesting book,Autobiography of a Yogi: by Paramahansa Yogananda is about this author inspiring accounts of his life and the ancient science of Yoga. The author comes across many saints and erudite individuals in his search throughout India. During his long journey the author has met many renowned spiritual personalities of both the East and the West. The book is both inspiring and entertaining.
5,Classic must read,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would highly recommend it to any one interested in spirituality, India, history, Yoga and just life. Slow start, but interesting, inspiring and really a classic. I ran into the book after someone recommended it to me, and I am so glad I did....my favorite parts about the living saint Babji and the miracles the author witnessed. Fun and thought provoking. Loved it."
5,Incredible!,The autobiograpy is beautifully written and so simple to follow. I love Yogananda's story and how it just takes me through his jounrney to what he was meant to do.
2,Too much milacres for one book,"Technically my book is not recognizing the dictionary while all the rest of my kindle have no problem.The book itself is a Carlos Castaneda style, good insights with a feeling of fiction imagination on it."
2,So much for flying gurus,"There is a lot of good info about yoga and the book is well written. It's ""scientific"" until the latter third when miracles and flying yogas appear. Use well salted. The followers I've met seem pretty sane.Like all meditation methods, his probably has value, if nothing else to clear the noise in your head."
1,Seduction to Hybris,"What Mr. Yogananda basicly says is that he is God, and that through the powers of yoga he is almighty. Well, he better is, otherwise he is not more than a mere psychopath.Also, what he tells us about yoga is quite one-sided. For instance, he seems to be rather asexual. He doesn't say anything about tantra or Shiva yoga, a form of yoga the famous orientalist and hindu Alain Dani√©lou preferred (""Yoga. Method of Reintegration"" or ""Shiva and Dionysus""). What is striking is that the demonic aspects of yoga are completly left out. But you do open yourself up to demons if you practise yoga, as the brahman R.R. Maharaj (""Escape into the Light"") has shown. Yoganandas approach seems to be specifically tailored for an scientifically oriented western audience. The spiritual dangers of yoga are totally surpessed.During my research on Indian culture I came across the classic ""Christ of the Indian Road"" by E. Stanley Jones. This is the book I liked best. I found it extremly sound."
5,A Powerful Spiritual Awakening & Reference,I started reading this book after my yoga instructor recommended it a few months prior. I could not believe the awakening and journey this spiritual classic continues to take me on even after I finished this book some time ago. My very close grandmother passed away recently and my Father and I were both reading this book at the time. I shared three or four sections of this book with my father that I believe significantly helped him and I deal with his mother's passing. This book has also helped me better connect to my yoga and meditation practice. I am ever thankful for the opportunity to have read this. Yogananda's passage on the after-life is awe-inspiring and revealing like none other I've ever read. Thank you for letting me share this with you. May you have a joyous and loving journey.
5,One of the most important books ever published,"This book succeeds on so many different levels. It changed my life. It is fabulously entertaining but at the same time has incredible depth. I've read it countless times and listen to the audio version (narrated nicely by Sir Ben Kingsley) on a regular basis. Chapter 43 is possibly the most important chapter of a book EVER. The chapter details the resurrection of Yogananda's Guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar. Sounds like hyperbole, right? Check it out for yourself. There aren't enough superlatives to adequately describe this book. I suggest that every person on the planet should read this! Even if you fight spirituality with every fiber of your being, it still provides an intimate glimpse of the world at one of the most tumultuous periods in world history: the 1930's. Most importantly, the book encourages each person to make a sincere effort in order to know God. What could be more important?"
5,Kahlil Gibran of the East...,"An inspiring book introduced to me by my father, I have grown with the wise words of the Yogi. There was a time I could never believe anything related to the so called ""holy men"", but Paramhansa Yogananda changed my preconceived notion towards Yogis and holy men in general. Some of them are, in fact, beyond the restrains imposed by any religion, above fixed beliefs.When I shifted to my own abode, this was one of the first tomes that I acquired. And now with Kindle, I was truly touched when I could download the topaz version of this great publication. Like Kahlil Gibran's Prophet, this is my book of choice to gift to friends.Highly recommended to anyone who approaches spirituality with an open mind."
5,"""Generations to come may scarce believe that such a one as this...""","As Albert Einstein said of Mahatma Gandhi - about the rareness, the unbelievability of his life - so may be said of this yoga master.I thought that saints were long gone. I thought that love for God was only for irrational, careless and unthinking true believers. Here comes a response I can use: test the possibilities of spirituality for yourself. See what ""miracles"" appear in your life once you learn the discipline the mind and open the heart through yoga.I've yet to begin to resemble any of the saints whose lives crossed Yogananda's path. But I know I can nolonger be satisfied with ordinary worldly life. Such is the power of this author and his words to awaken belief, eternal hope, divine determination.To those who have eyes these words may awaken undreamed-of possibilities."
3,Who needs a guru?,This book is rather slow going particularly in the beginning. Be patient and you will learn a remarkable story of a man from a place light years away. Yogananda's story centers on his relationship with his guru and strict adhearence to the discipline of yoga. There are several amusing stories of saints who could perform miracles along with anecdotes about Indian history and culture. Yogananda has a lot of passion about what he says. I personally don't like to be told what to do -- no guru for me. I also think that most people's ability to reason using cognitive problem solving skills is a miracle in and of it's self. Yoganada demands that human reasoning be put aside if we are to believe. If you are a romantic this book is worth while. If you reject authority -- no guru for you.
1,A ...,"This book has been so completely changed and edited by Self Realization Fellowship that it no longer reflects the thoughts and subtle meaning of Yogananda's deep teaching. All of these editorial changes have taken place after Yogananda passed away in 1952. It is sad that SRF has chosen to change the writing of this great avatar to meet their own twisted goals. But don't believe me, see for yourself. Crystal Clarity publishes an unchanged edition of the great work. Check it out. Find out for yourself what Yogananda had to say."
5,Filled with Heart,"I read Autobiography of a Yogi for the first time over 25 years ago. It still brings tears to my eyes. While some might argue that many of the stories in the book are somewhat fanciful or romantized, I can't help but be moved by how much heart this book shows. In this world filled with dogma and ""sharp edges"", it is very refreshing to find a book that expresses such deep love for God and fellow human beings.I have read many good books on Yogic and also Buddhist traditions. But this one will alway remain one of my all time favorites."
5,Illuminating!,"A book that has given me much hope, and spiritual direction. Beautifully written and infused with a love of God that touches the reader. It reads like an adventure story, and then explains God, the universe, existence, and self-realization. It truly has changed my life,inspired, and motivated me in my own spritual search. I highly recommend this book."
4,Taiyo Yuden are the BEST,"I use these discs frequently and have never had a ""coaster."" These come in plastic wrap, there is no spindle, so be aware of this when you order. You can't go wrong with these DVD's at all. And, they are not too expensive either. The only other DVD-R's that come close to this quality is Verbatim. Don't buy anything else."
4,Very good but it needs subtitles in all languages,It is a very good documentary material but it need in the next edition subtitles in spanish french italian portugues and in other languages because all people in the world need to know the truth and the roots of the history to understand the diplomatic position of Israel and Palestina in the actual history and the negotiations to create the palestinian state. The 1967 war was a anihilation war against Israel and the territory prices that Israel won in the six days war were gave in change of peace. To return all territories is a condition of impossible acomplishment that Israel enemies want to never live in peace in middle orient.
2,More like the Six Years of Diplomacy and the Making of the Six Days of War,"About half the book (170 of 340 pages) is spent on the several years of developments leading to the war. A lot of diplomatic minutia. This detail may not be obvious in the description. I was expecting a little more on the war and developments after the war. Afterall, the title is ""Six Days of War: 1967 and the Making of the Middle East"". Ever read a book and you wonder when something is going to happen? Discussions in the Israeli cabinet leading to the war? 30-40 pages. Israeli airstrikes against the Egyptians? 3-4 pages, maybe. Buy it again? No."
5,must read,An excellent history of the 6 day war.Well documented. Good view from all sides.Very fast reading and very informative
5,Georgous photography creative and easy to follow directions,"Until I read this book I never dreamed that there were so many creative ways to set up portable plant features for every area of the home. Especially good is the section on water features complete with plants and fish. The step-by-step instructions are as easy to follow as connecting the dots but the results will bring a lot more compliments like, ""However did you do that?"" Inside, outside, shady or sunny, this book has me believing that we can be successful with plants anywhere."
4,If it weren't slow and ink was cheaper,"Printing quality is very good if you use the proper software, I have had it for three years now. And the only things that bother me about it is that is slow and Ink cartridges are to expensive. It becomes slower if you have XP and the XP drivers, but the generic drivers on XP don't allow to monitor the ink levels. If you don't print on a daily basis (which will make you save on ink cartridges),and speed is not a concern is a very good buy. All my digital pictures were printed on it, but you have to learn how to use the photo editing software and which one is better in order to get good results, since they wont match quality of lab printing on 35 mm. The Print Picture task on the MY Pictures folder has proven to be the best for me, and printing at 600 DPI will do the job 1200 is way slower and there is not much of a difference."
3,Never Preach Past Noon,I am about 50% through reading this on my Kindle. It is a slow moving book. I do like the way this series is written. I will finish--especially since Baseball games will soon be over. HAHA!
1,"N Sync + Guitars, drum, and bass= This junk","What a coincidence, MTV decies boy bands are over and now they move into the pop punk genre. What does MTV have planned for us next? A ""metal"" version of britney spears? A rap version of ""puddle of mudd"". MTV viewers are a lame excuse for living."
4,Thoroughly Thrilling,"This is something superbly surprising for someone who wrote the preppy semi-mosh song ""Fat Lip"". Good song, over played. Anyway back to this album. I bought it expected a shotty album after hearing the descent high power-ballad ""All to Blame"". Wow was I surprised. But I found it hard to take serious at first from a band that used to play pop-punk. Keywords USED TO. This is not metal. No way is it metal, but it is rock'n'roll. And my friends rock'n'roll ain't noise pollution. This is the album to kickstart a new wave of classic metal-classic rock/a hint of punk new wave of rock. The track ""Bitter End"" sounds like Metallica, wheras they have no problem bustin' out the acoustic for a ballad. I do hope they are serious about this sound they are going for, cause I like it. I like it alot."
1,Nope,"This band sucks. They are horrible, all they do is scream and whine in their songs, and then swear every other ten seconds to act tough. Its so annoying, get Papa Roach or SOcial Distortrion if ;you like good rock. Dont buy these cds. This band sucks."
1,Pop punk?,"How in the hell is this band pop punk? What am I missing out on? I actually took the time to listen to this album and a few others from them, and out of all 4 i listened too, this one is the worst. I swear, MTV keeps putting out worthless crap all the time. If you have even a slightly decent taste in music, don't waste your money on this trash. Oh yeah, almost forgot, the song ""the bitter end"" is a total ripoff of Metallica's ""battery""."
4,Rock on Sum 41,"I heard of Sum 41 from the Cheaper by the Dozen soundtrack. They sang ""In too Deep"" I love that song so I check out some other songs by them. This album is pretty good, I like three songs on it: Pieces, Some Say, and There's No Solution. They're mostly Punk and Hard Rock. Sometimes they'll play some metal. I don't like metal. Anyway, this album is pretty good. I'm not sure why I never heard them on the radio. They rock hard! if you like Green Day you'll probably like Sum41"
4,WOW!!!!,"Being the president of a music assication that caters to mostly metal and power rock it's always a pleasure to hear bands that have slowly changed over the years. Sum 41 and Lit carried the torch but Lit slipped and Sum 41 has obviously been taking steroids (that's a joke, they don't play baseball). But seriously, they've entered the punk/metal arena full force without forgetting their roots. I enjoyed this cd emmencely and recommend to all my metal friends."
4,good,"this was another sum 41 cd that seemed more metallish. the only reason i dont give it 5 stars is because like other viewers say, the bitter end sounds a lot like metallica's battery."
4,Don't expect this,"This is probably their best album mainly because I didn't like their early albums but this album is somewhat better. Better arrangements especially with the Metallica like sounding in some of the songs and maybe some Maiden bits.A good fun album album, nothing too serious."
4,Sum 41's one of the best.,"Sum 41's known for having fun. This album is, I think one of their best. I am sure, you'll atleast have one song stuck in your head. They're lyrics have gotten darker, but yet have a enjoyable twist to it. The song ""Peices"" is one of their darker songs, with a lightley strummed guitars, and such.I have listened to this repeatedly, hum to the songs and what not."
4,"Wow, a solid 4 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Any music group that has the guts to stand up and speak their mind I salute with the utmost respect. Regardless that is a pop punk/metal group from Canada. The personal political references gives me goose bumps and makes me appreciate THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND CREATIVITY. And the music has blossomed into some kind of metal thing with driving riffs and double kick drums. Very recommended for any music fan of any genre. DON'T BE FEARFUL...it's just Sum 41.
4,An album dedicated to a hero !,"Well I just purchased the Sum 41 a few days a go , and I find it very different from there other two.They incorporate a few differnt sounds into this album , the other two are more of a punk based sound mixed with a bit of harder rock. This has a few songs that are slower and seem to mean something a bit more to the band.It might be the fact that when they where in congo , they had a close call.Sum 41 is one of my favorite bands and I am in no way disappointed in this album ""Chuck""."
3,hmmm....?!?,"Though I did enjoy some songs from Sum 41's metal-influenced 2004 release, I found that it all just got really repetitive. I could never sit through the whole thing. Vocalist Deryck Whibley seems to have resorted to screaming in some of the songs, and though that might win over some metalheads who had disregarded Sum 41 before, it left me a bit confused. Still, some standout tracks made Chuck a solid three star album. They are-3. We're All To Blame- The first single, the lyrics are well thought out and it's pretty catchy.4. Angels With Dirty Faces- This one's just cool to me.5. Some Say- One of the best on the cd. It's great.8. Slipping Away- This one's kinda soothing to me, I know that sounds corny but it really is soothing.11. Pieces- This ones also great.12. There's No Solution- Pretty Good.13. 88- I love this one.So, all in all, if you like metal music, you might like Chuck. However, if you like a bit lighter, less serious music, you might want to try their older stuff."
4,nice..,"I had to buy this charger when I bought the Denali cordless vac. The battery slides on and off easily, and charges REALLY fast. I don't recommend you keep it plugged it as it can get very warm even w/ out a battery charging in it."
1,Slow Start Ruins Entire Movie,"It might not be a bad movie but the start is so slow that you're bored out of your mind before anything funny happens, and when it does you're not in the mood for it anyway."
3,...a lot I forgot before watching with my kids!,"If you remember this movie from your childhood and are thinking of watching it with your children, like my husband and I did, I hope this helps you... I remembered the adventure and fun of the story but I had forgotten about the language used and sexual innuendo. The Playboy magazine that is referenced and shown throughout the movie, the scene where the tow-truck driver arrives home to find his wife and another man having an affair, the gang scene on the subway in which ""the F word"" is used twice. There are many other instances with four-letter words; I won't list them all.It's still a good movie, just not for my nine-year old to watch!As far as the streaming and quality of picture, that was all great -no problem at all. We streamed through our Blu-Ray player and there were no problems."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"I love this movie! I saw it last night, and I immediately fell in love! I'm very pleased that every review so far has been 5 stars!P.S. If you havn't seen this movie-YOU'RE MISSING OUT!"
3,FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT MOVIE,I SAW THIS MOVIE WITH MY KIDS AND THEY ENJOY IT A LOT. IT IS A FAMILY MOVIE AND IT IS AS FRESH FOR THEM AS IT WAS FOR ME. I ENJOY IT A LOT. GOOD MOVIE FOR THE FAMILY TO SEE AND LEARN SOME.
5,"It should be titled ""The Big Night OUT!""","If it had been titled ""The Big Night Out"", people may have thought the movie was about Elisabeth Shue's big date with her ""boyfriend"". Then people would have thought that night was to be filled with wondrous and fun adventures on the big night out.However, the title is not the best, but the movie is.There are a few naughty words in the movie, but they fit the situation.The movie is cute. There are several scenes that make me chuckle inside.I recommend this movie to anyone, even hardened old crones. haVincent D'Onofrio of Law and Order:Criminal Intent plays a very significant part."
3,Fun eighties nostalgia,"Despite the score I love this movie. But the truth is it is neither funny enough or clever enough to warrant a higher score. Elisabeth Shue is extremely winning in her first lead role, and really deserved to go onto better things. Adventures follows Elisabeth on her journey with the three kids she's babysitting and her attempt to help a friend stuck in the city. They get into all sorts of theoretically wacky scrapes that never really hit the comedic peaks you'd hope. But the whole journey adds up to a satisfying experience and you'll probably find yourself with a stupid grin by the end. On a side the note, this DVD is quite poor, the picture is not anamorphic and the sound is not Dolby Digital. If you look back at eighties movies with fondness this is probably a worthy purchase."
5,Babysitting Adventure,This is a good movie about a girl who ends up babysitting when her boyfriend cancels their date. I dont want to be to much of a spoiler so all Im going to say from there is that it wasnt your ordinary babysitting job which should be obvious. Any its a good movie.
1,Unacceptable,"The shoes are comfortable but the structure of the shoes does not provide support for the sidewalls. They are constantly trying to rollover and your feet are trying to slide off the soles. At a cost of $49, I expected much higher quality construction. When I replace them, they will quickly find a new home in my trash can. Bad purchase!"
2,Sam needs the studio magic from Burnett,"I was extremely disappointed with this CD. I thought sparse production would be a plus for Ms. Phillips. How wrong I was. Bring back the production, add some interesting noises, more instruments -- anything to add some melody to this effort. My favorite CDs from Sam Phillips are ""Cruel Inventions"" and ""Martinis & Bikinis"" -- both of which are sonically impressive. ""Fan Dance"" is dull and not one song sticks in your head after repeated listenings. There are many female artists that can wow audiences with just their songs,their voice and an acoustic guitar -- Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, Rickie Lee Jones...to name a few. Unfortunately, Sam Phillips is not in their class. At least not with this effort."
2,A disappointment.,"I have all of Sam Phillips' albums. I've seen her live twice. She has one of the most interesting voices in popular music. However, I don't like this album. The music, for my taste, is too sparse compared to her previous works. I happen to like unabashed pop music and Sam Phillips has crafted some of the most wonderful pop music since The Beatles . I understand that artists want to grow and expand their music beyond what they've done in the past. And sometimes it really succeeds. In this case, for my ears, it didn't. I still plan to buy the next Sam Phillips album though because even though I don't care for ""Fan Dance"", I'm still a fan."
5,Nice Surprise!,"This angry movie about three different friends of different backgrounds who only have their neighborhood in common, is very well directed and entertaining. The directot shows a lot of talent and a very promising future!"
5,Amazing,"This film serves to awaken the viewer to the harsh reality of the inner-city children around Paris, and does so in a both artistic and entertaining way. Mathieu Kassovitz's accurate social commentary and masterful direction makes this film one of the best to come out of France, and certainly one of the best inner city films ever made."
2,Len gets more repetitive as the album drones on,"The first time I ever heard this album, I loved it; then reality set in. I realized that this Canadian group of mediocre talent was putting on a show for us from one of their basements. I mean, come on, what really is the meaning of ""Steal My Sunshine?"" Unless it has some deep inner meaning that is unable to be caught after the first 100 listenings (much like the critically-acclaimed ""The Catcher in the Rye""), this song is a waste of people's time. Perhaps ""Man of the Year"" will persuade you not to buy it, but please, SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you don't agree with my comments, don't fume at home, e-mail me at: lawellm@wra.net"
2,"The lyrics ""I know it's not for me"" describe this CD.","I really, really love the song ""Steal My Sunshine"" (the one and only reason for 2 stars) so I bought the CD about a week ago. Big mistake. I can't even tell what musical genre ""Can't Stop The Bum Rush"" is! Those ""dance"" songs with hardly any lyrics are extremely stupid, pointless, and time wasting. Shar (the girl) has, in my opinion, a very beautiful voice and hardly ever sings on this CD. It's really annoying when all the guys do the singing-that-sounds-like-talking with no music in the background.Put in short: If you're buying this just for ""Steal My Sunshine, you will be very dissopointed. I, however, request Garbage's Version 2.0I think this CD just needs some time ...A lot of time, come to think of it."
4,A great new artist with a great funky beat.,I am really impressed with tis CD. It is a mix of the old computer synthisized sound of the 80's and the current sounds of rap and R&B. An excellent CD if you are a fan of the 80's sounds.
3,Very good and very bad,"It's CDs like this one which make me wish they still included lyrics in the liner notes.I bought the CD for ""Steal My Sunshine"", I admit. What bothered me was the bit of Rap tacked on at the end. OTOH, this one track justifies the CD in my opinion. I don't care for Rap in general, and that's effectively what this CD contains."
5,KIck-but new style,"Has a old school feel n certain songs and new kind of ""feel good"" thing going on other songs"
1,Disappointed!!!!,Usually love Robyn Carr but with this book I felt she dragged on to much. When I got to the middle of the book I did not like how the story line was going to go and who Clare was going to end up with. Clearly disappointed in the characters. Dont want to write to much to give away the ending. Would of like to see Clare end up in a healthy relationship with someone new. Story line was too much for me to believe or even go there.
4,Good book,"Took awhile for me to get into it, but it really turned out good! I love Robyn Carr's books. Especially the Virgin River series!"
3,Wow. This was hard work...,"I bought this book because I LOVED the movie. I still prefer the movie over the book...it lost me in the long and, as another reviewer noted, really tedious descriptions of the sexual escapades of some characters. Really ruined the book for me...I was unmoved and turned off by the whole ""useless arm' scenario...just didn't get it. A lot of description of the characters in the shetl killed the charm as well. Very unlikable types in many ways. The most enjoyable and moving were those scenes that were also covered in the movie...the search for Trachimbrod, the diaglogue between Jonathan and Alex - quite brilliant. Would have been better as two separate books."
5,This book was perfect!,"This book was absolutly perfect. Nothing written on any pages, absolutly no damage! PERFECT! I am extremely happy that i purchased this book and will definately purchase another book with ecampus.!"
4,Even A Liberal Can Write A Good Essay,"Although the editorial selection clearly slants to the left, and is bubbling with postmodernism, many of the essays here are quite enjoyable, especially the humorous prose of James Thurber and Mark Twain, and George Orwell's ""Politics and the English Lanuage"" is delightfully informative. The best expositionary anthology I've yet seen."
4,Pretty Good,"It would be impossible to make a perfect Bauhaus album because everybody has a different opinion of what there best songs are. For having a fairly defined genre, There songs are pretty varied. This album is good for casual fans, for whom a greatest hits album is all they need and probably want. For the true fans, this album offers nothing you shouldn't already own. If you're not sure about Bauhaus, I'd recommend just downloading a few tracks, probably Bela Lugosi's Dead or Dark Entries, to see what you think. Bauhaus can be an acquired taste. In my opinion the tracks this album is missing are God in an Alcove, All We Ever Wanted Was Everything, Slice of Life and most curiously; Stigmata Martyr. The cover of Ziggy Stardust is unnecessary for the album and the space could have been used for something better. Finally, I like the song Crowds. I can understand why no one else in the world does, but I'm glad to see it on this collection."
3,A little disappointed.,"Overall the Starck clock has the functionailty I was after but the quality of the screen is terrible. Rather than having crisp dark looking digits, all the information looks faded out no matter what angle you look at it from. You can read the display but I expected a lot more from Oregon."
3,Small clouds of clever humor!,"In spite certain innate vulgarity, the movie shows us a mordacious sense of humor along instants that conforms a light entertainment without major pretensions.The picture achieves its task, under the perspective of its outrageousness."
3,If you don't smoke don't watch,"This movie is an all out stoner flick, smoke and you will love it, if you don't smoke don't watch."
1,Dreadful,"This is one of the worst films I have seen in my entire life. While the first one was no masterpiece, it was at least fun and entertaining. The plot here is almost nonexistent; it eventually becomes about a plot to blow up a ""man-whore"" award show. The acting is bad, the jokes are stupid, and even at a running time of 83 minutes, it feels way too long. Even if you enjoyed the first one, avoid this at all costs."
1,jikoplilopkoljdjnannajj,well i got this about a buck back and i ain't understanding how to play it in them high tech dvd player. so i ate it than fed it to wilson my pet horse
5,R. Kelly is a genius!!!,"The is something so wonderful about this man and his music. He has truly capture the sounds of Chicago, relationship issues, cliches and more! I love listening to him. Kelly is truly talented!"
3,skateland,"This movie is slow going and the language is a bit rough for my liking. I was thinking it shows ""what not to do"" for older teenagers. But in the end there was a small morale which redeemed it in my eyes. I would rate it Average."
2,For the love of God,"I just bought this cd tonight and yes it is a bit early to start critisizing, but come on. If you expect this cd to be some good cream hits like i did, its not. This isn't cream like ' oakenfold's 2 years of cream'. This is all vocal rubbish. It's lame mixing and i don't suggest you buy this album. I spend 16 quid on this frieken album and its not worth a fiver. Don't buy it. This is very discoish and i wish i wouldn't of bought, in fact the only reason i did buy this is because i went to an HMV shop and they had a rubbish selection of dance music. I was lookin for ' Great Wall' by oakenfold and this was basicaly all that was there. So don't get caught in the situation i was in. Go to a good dance music shop and get urself a good progressive mix. NOT THIS!"
5,early challenge is good,"I'm very pleased with this book. It brought fun and challenge to my child's early reading. It provides mind stretching language activities like vocabulary development, synonyms/antonyms, word identification from context clues, multiple meanings, main ideas, writing purpose, story plots, characters... They aroused my child's interest without going for far-fetched stuff. She learned a lot while having fun. My only complain is that the book is so thin. We finished it in 3 weeks. Looking for similar material, I found Beestar's weekly drills (http://www.beestar.org) very good, too. My child is fairly ahead in school because of having such after-school programs. Best of all, she is happy and confident with what she learned."
1,What a letdown.,"After reading about this ""great, classic, etc"" movie for years, I finally laid hands on a copy and viewed it. This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It almost seemed like a joke at times. I do love the arthouse movies, film noir, classics, and other non-mainstream cinema, but I honestly do not get the hype over this waste of time. Avoid it."
1,Pretty/painful,"Well, they didn't mess up the scenery at least. They got that wondrfully right. Bad script, bad direction, and even worse acting. One wonders if Kinski & the cast came from a frontal lobotomy ward. They wouldn't seem out of place there anyway. Pretty/painful."
4,Kinski at his vile best,I just watched Aquirre the Wrath of God. I had heard a lot about it. I found Klaus Kinski to be mesmorizing. He was spectacular. The story itself was a very honest and uncompromising saga and period piece. I thought that Werner Herzogs directing was visually stunning and that the final scene on the raft was compelling. This movie is not for everyone but I would have to say dittos to those who have deemed it a classic.
5,An Experience.,"I never knew much about this movie until the other day when I was reading some Top 100 Lists put out by famous critics. It was even more impressive than advertised. from moment one. The opening is absolutely captivated as it thrusts you back into the timeframe the director wishes to recreate. Intensity, intensity, and more intensity is the best way to describe this film. Every time Kinski is onscreen it's impossible to notice anyone else. He absorbs our attention immediately. The peripherals--like the score, the Incan flute music, and even the cluck clucking of Aguirre's right hand man--increase the tension which is only somewhat relieved in the final sequence. Viewers know exactly what is coming but that does not diminish its power and our amazement. This one belongs in everyone's Top 100."
2,Pretty Boring,"This was pretty boring for a feature length movie. I suggest turning on the commentary. It is much more interesting with the commentary. Please don't respond with, ""Pretty BORING!@?!!? Just because there aren't special effects and blah blah, et cetera..."" Firstly, it did have special effects - cannons - and second a lot of this was improvised - Herzog states that he was creating dialogue just before shooting scenes in the commentary. This, in my opinion, destroyed the aesthetic of pure documentary, or true improvisation which would have had the actors creating their own dialogue and story. Thus, I found it boring and no one can't change that. Muahahaha... can't..."
2,monkeys cannons no bears-oh my!,"Poor dvd quality--there has to be a better edition out there (somehow I got a fullscreen copy, f**k!).Cast and script--will challenge your patience if you are not already into Herzog and/or Kinski.Personally found it disappointing, but more than watch-able. Herzog's obtusely insightful commentaries on his films alone are worth i t."
5,"Aguirre, the Wrath of God",I find so few movies today where the plot is reliant on the acting and the viewer has to use their own intelligent connection to stream the plot. I thought this movie was intensely disturbing and valid to the time period it evoked. A brilliant piece of cinema. If only Hollywood could take notice.
4,ELVIS incomplete,"Anything that deals with the KING is worthwhile as long as the info contained therein is correct. I didn't notice any mistakes on first viewing. Only problem is that the period from his return from the Army, in 1960, and his wedding, in 1967, is glossed over. It would have been a more impressive package if it had gone into some discussion of the films ELVIS did from 1960 to 1964, before the Colonel started putting him in inferior remakes of the movies he had already done. ELVIS demonstrated genuine acting ability in ""Flaming Star"" and "" Wild In THe Country"", and showed a flair for comedy in ""Follow That Dream"". Also would have been better if reference was made to the films that ELVIS was offered, and the Colonel (probably) turned down: ""Sweet Bird of Youth"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", and ""A Star Is Born"" to name a few."
5,Didnt work,Purchased this because my husband's key fob had broken and he couldnt have it on his key ring. Followed the directions but it did not work. Then we ended up purchasing a new vehicle and did not need the product.
4,Good choice,"Meryl Streep at her best, gorgeous and vulnerable. Kevin Kline, spectacular.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman tried to copy them in 'Eyes wide shut' with no success. A Modern, more technically advanced Elvira Madigan?This is a movie to own. Watch it annually to remind you to never, ever fall victim of living in a rut.Destruction of ourselves in the need and helpless want of passion."
1,Sophie's Choice,"I bought this for my girlfriend who loves Meril Streep...I like her too...very talented...Kevin Kline: also very talented (""A friend called Wanda""...hilarious)...but this movie: went in the trash...absolute trash..."
3,"Messy, but lit by Meryl","The story can sometimes feel overly packed, we the viewers sliding from the narrator, to Sophie's past, to her present, to her more distant experiences, to her sociopath husband. It's saving grace is Meryl Streep and the performance she gives, culminating in the beautiful, harrowing scene where she makes her 'decision'.However, ultimately this movie still feels slumped by its messy script and very often (particularly at the start) it can almost feel as though it's a play we're watching, all the action contained to a few rooms, interspersed with flask-backs."
1,Viewing disturbed by technical glitch,"What I saw of the movie was fine, but the DVD would not play beyond the 25th chapter of the movie in any player I tried. Anyone else have that problem?"
2,Disappointed!,The only good thing about this movie was Meryl Streep (who deserves 5 stars). I was looking forward watching this movie (when I got it) but I was very disappointed!
4,Good,"I liked this book because it was organized to give different variations to the different card games in an organized fashion. Because of this feature, I have already used the book a number of times."
4,Vip Made,Vip Made is a very good album. It's definitly different from that of other local Houston rappers. There's great potential here. I would most certainly recommend this album to everyone.
4,Excellent practical advice.,"If you're looking for technique, this isn't it. What you do get is much more important: straightforward advice on romance. This book is full of practical information on attracting your woman, generating romance, and pleasuring her _mind._"
5,BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had the opportunity to preview this book. After reading it, I gave it to my husband. It says everything that I always wanted to say, but never could. What an improvement this has made in our sex life! I highly recommend this book for men. It was written by a WOMAN who truly knows what a woman wants."
5,Dream Theater - Live at Budokan,"I've a Dream Theater fan since 92 and I've seen them many times live, including the Train of Thought tour. Many of the Amazon reviews say this is there best DVD and I would have to agree that the quality is high. The bands performance is as solid as you would expect. In terms of production quality, I'd put this set right next to Led Zepplins DVD set or Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society - Boozed Broozed & Broken-Boned DVDIf you are a die-hard fan, you'll definitely enjoy the segements on the second disk. John, Mike, and Jordan each have segements talking about their stage set-up, which I found to be a highlight of the package."
4,"In one word: ""Amazing""","I think this DVD is fantastic. This live performance is one the best i've seen. The music turns from heavy and angry to soft and melodic. The production is superb, the audio is great and the songs are played without a mistake. Once again these guys prove that they are amazing players. Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess and Myung are awesome with their instruments. LaBrie is singing better and more controlled than in previous tours. I give a 4 star rating because the song list it's a bit disapointing, it could have been better. But, if you are a die hard fan, get this DVD! It's a must."
3,do the words mean anything?,"Yeah, these guys sure can play fast. But it would be great if there was more going on here than just finger burning speed. And Labrie could be singing in Japanese and it wouldn't make that much difference. If this band is ever going to attract more than a cult following then they'll definitely need a charisma upgrade. The only guy on stage who seems to be having any fun is the drummer. I swear these guys are so into their instruments that it looks like a rehearsal. And any singer who isn't playing an instrument definitely needs to get out from behind the mic stand. You can play every scale in the book but you still need a tune."
3,Great release but.............,"I love DT and i think they are some of the greatest musicians on the planet.But this is a bit overkill for me personally,i can tell DT are trying to put out all they can before they start getting older,which kinda frightens me.Do we really need ALL these live releases and DVDs.Hopefully this doesnt burn them out and hopefully they are not doing this because they are planning on throwing in the towel sometime soon.Lets hope not.Great DVD though,just slow down and take a break for a bit guys."
2,leather pants?,"Very good musicians but music does not rock,is boring and they seem very mechanical and don't seem to enjoy playing music.And what rock star has to wear leather pants now a days (when did Jimmy Morrison die)"
5,mind blowing,"i""m an old guy who""s never really been into hard rock ,progressive rock, but we get every chance in one""s lifetime to stumble upon these fab bands thanks to computers and the internet. this band is amazing there playing ability is fabulous, i love this dvd and every number is great, especially instrumedly and this dying soul, just great. iv""e also got into rush, yes,deep purple. i love most forms of musicbut this format has taken my fancy for now,how i wish i had the ability to play like these guy""s, at least i""m thankful that they are filmed and presented for us to enjoy for years to come"
2,Much ado about nothing much,"The way Roger Ebert and TIME magazine described this movie made me buy it and see it. I was expecting a gruesome masterpiece, something like Bu√±uel's ""Los Olvidados"" or any film by Bigas Lunas. Certainly, Arturo Ripstein directing is always a good omen, but... alas, it was not to be!Sure, the story is quite disturbing, but not as shocking as you'd think. Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho and Regina Orozco are O.K. but not in their roles of a lifetime. The girl playing the last victim makes the best performance of them all, and Almod√≥var's favorite Marisa Paredes is thoroughly wasted in the most dreadful acting I've ever seen. Too bad, really, but worth watching once.Remember, it ain't over 'til the fat lady... sinks!"
1,this product really sucks!!!,"When i bought my USB Data Cable i was a little worried that it wouldn't work because i read all the reviews below and none of them were positive. I told myself ""This wont happen to me, maybe my cable will work."" well i was wrong! if you want to buy this product and are thinking like i was, your are just going to waste your time and money because this product sucks. It is advertised that it is compatible with the Nokia 6102i phone, but it didn't work for my 6102i. it took me forever to install the drivers and i had to download a bunch of diffrent programs and it still doesnt work. When i plugged in the cable to my phne it says ""Enhancement not supported"". I gave up and im thinking of buying the expensive cable and you should too! dont buy this cheap imitation because you will only be wasting your time and money."
1,"This book should be retitled ""Waste of Time and Money for ..",This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. The examples are poorly explained and teach you absolutely nothing. When I picked up this book I had some (though limited) knowledge of SQL. After reading this book I found myself confused and discouraged. If you are into ASP and SQL I would recommend Beginning ASP Databases (Wrox Press) by John Kauffman.
3,"3 and a half, actually...Good Stuff","I heard about this album from a magazine so I just went out and bought it on a whim. It's much better than i expected but not spectacular. Its def worth owning though. 40 Below Summer is a very original sounding band, which is hard to do nowadays. I give them credit for somewhat setting themselves apart from the rather bland nu-metal scene. They are a very good blend of intensity and melody. Most bands today claim they are but 40 Below Summer actually delivers. Songs are somewhat repetitive but theyr still good. The cd also flaunts some hard hop influences most notably on Step Into The Sideshow and Rejection. My favorite songs are Drown and the opener We The People. We The People just makes you want to get up and jump and scream and let out aggression. Drown is fairly slow but it has an epic feel to it. You goootta love it. This is a very good CD to own and it is a very good release, fun to listen to when you are [ticked]."
3,Has more ups than downs,"I picked this CD up after hearing Falling Down, which is one of the best songs I've heard in a while. So I took the chance of not knowing what the rest of the CD sounded like and bought it anyway. After reading some of these reviews, I can see both points of view. Sure, its not the most original music or lyrics, but 40 Below do the cliches so well, it's worth the listen. Top notch screaming, strong drums, and good guitar work definitly make it worth the 12 bucks I paid for it. Songs like Rope, Wither Away, Falling Down, Smile Electric, and Jonesin' really show what this band can do. It seems the band tried to be a little more experimental and not get caught up with trends on these songs. If 40 Below stick with that direction, I think their next CD will be mind blowing."
5,Great Mood Music,"DO NOT waste your money buying the thirty some dollar Tapestry CD, instead, buy this one. It's got all of her hits, sung wonderfully. This CD always puts me in a good mood. Her intoxicating voice combined with her earthy lyrics make it a very mellow album. Save your money and buy this one. You won't be disappointed."
3,Read this book,"This book was given to me by a friend when I started my business. It was a godsend! It showed me how to streamline and make my company more effective. It was this book, along with Guerrilla PR Wired, that made me a success."
2,Introduction to Modeling of Transport Phenomena in Porous Me,porous media specifically the topic of filtratio
4,soundtrack heaven,"i love the movie so i decided to buy the soundtrack,i lke to listen to it when going to bed , you will not be dissappointed,"
4,great follow up service,"there was a problem with the cartridge, the company immediately corrected the situation with no cost to me"
3,Ink ran out way to fast,I have a X83 lexmark all in one printer scanner copier. Seems like I printed out four pictures and it was out of ink. Not very happy and now I own a Epson All in one.
3,High priced compared to others,"Before you buy a new printer, see which cartridges are available at discount sellers like Costco. While the Lexmark Z51 is an excellent printer, the cartridges are only available at full price retail stores. The Z31 has cartridges available at Costco for almost half the price. But if your reading this, it probably already to late. . ."
3,Why does price continue to be so high?,"The print quality is good but the price is only for the rich. Lexmark needs to bring these prices down and fast. I may soon have to stop using my printer because I can no longer afford these cartridges. I am now very sorry that I bought the Lexmark printer, I should have gotten one where the cartridges are cheaper."
2,this book is way to thin and a rip off. It has no good info.,"it is hardly worth the money. your better off getting the same info off a web site for free, I don't recommend theis book, i would only if it were bigger and had more info.From, A die hard Jaromir fan"
5,Love this CD!,"If you are expecting a female Elvis then you will be disappointed. If you like an edgy rock sound, you will love this. I almost laugh out loud every time I hear Idiot!"
5,Lisa M Presley,Better Than Her First cd Thats For Sure I'm Very Impressed withthis album she has issues but dont we all
2,You will do better next time princess!,I am not going to say much since everyone has pretty much covered every aspect of the project and several have even attempted to analyse lisa marie's emotional world.I think that basically music is a matter of taste.We all like different things. I love Lisa Marie's voice which i find unique and expressive. She is not a bad lyricist either. What really bothers me is the loud grungy rock production. I think she's much much better when she sings ballads than punk-rock(the cool ramones' cover excluded) and she was really wonderful when she sang dont cry daddy and in the ghetto. I know folk music is not as trendy as linda perry's glossy productions but as i have already said it is a matter of taste...Now What
5,Pure Honesty!!!!!!!,"""Thank You"" for sharing your talent with the world. It truly pours from your soul in this album. I LOVE IT!!!!!!This album is simply amazing. It has all the taste of my old fav's. Little rock, some R&B; and tons of soul!!I can't wait to see what the next one will hold. I know it will be truly amazing!Don't every change your style!! You got us fans hooked, line and sinkerd in with your lyrics!!!"
2,Nothing new!,How disappointed I was when I heard this CD and realized that Lisa made her first album another time.Nothing new here. It almost sounds like left-overs from her previous album.The track that features Pink is nice but all the songs look the same. She'd better do like her father and let talented songwriters write for her. She has a great voice but I think she hasn't found her style yet. This album sounds too much like a Sheryl Crow-meets-Alanis Morrissette album.I'm sorry to say all this but I had great expectations when she released her first album. So now with this second album...I'm sure she can do better than that. It's in the genes.
4,Lisa Marie is a pretty good singer to me.,"I was worried about getting this album at first, but I went ahead and got it and when I got home I listened to it, but at first I didn't really get into it but later on I listened to it more, and now it's I am kinda getting into it more, but it'll take awhile for me to love it. But her album is good, if you are a pop/rock music fan or Lisa Marie fan, I recommend this album to you. :-) I give this album 4 stars because, I don't love it all the way yet, I just like it =) But I do think it's a good album, so please don't try to think I'm not saying it's not good."
2,dissapointed,I really didn't enjoy this book. I can't really say why because it will spoil it for some people. I was just very dissapointed and felt the story could have been great.
5,Very Realistic and fast-paced!,"This is the best YA book Oates has wrote so far and I hope she keeps writing them, they keep getting better and better. I finished the whole book in just a few days so it's the perfect book to give to your friends and ask them to read and you don't have to wait for a long reply. READ THIS!!!"
5,Learning to keep Sabbath Holy,A Great read for those looking for the reason why to remember the Sabbath. This book is a classic. The body of the book shares why and how God calls us to a time of rest. Heschel's daughter's introduction shares how sacred this time was for her family growing up and the various ways they celebrated the Sabbath. I purchased the book to read a Jewish perspective on Sabbath from a beloved Jewish scholar and I was not disappointed.
3,Heschelian spirituality,"I liked this book, for several reasons.First, Heschel's a good writer and he put some things into words about the sabbath more beautifully than I've ever read before.Second, it helps me understand Jewish spirituality -- not biblical Judaism, mind you, but mystical Judaism. Interestingly enough, Heschel plays at the edges of intimacy -- not with God, but with the sabbath. There is no such intimacy within Judaism proper, but there is within Christianity.Third, it underscores for me once again why Jesus came to die, what he came to free us from.So I'm very glad I read it."
4,The big clue leads not where you think.,"The book is great fun to read. The young hero and and side investigator, Collin, finds perdictable romance, and helps Hercules solve a mystery from his armchair."
2,"Interesting, but not worth the money","Now don't get me wrong, I love Linkin Park, but who pays this much for a few bonus tracks? If you want different stuff by Linkin Park, go to mp3.com, type in Hybrid theory in the search column, and go to the old Hybrid Theory site. They've got some really cool freebe songs by Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, the whole crew. Personal fav; Carousel."
4,great to have,"it's great to have it, will get more similar ones if possiblegreat additionmom likes it very much !!"
5,Sized right,"I bought this for a 1 year old's birthday and my 2year old daughter found it and wouldn't let me wrap it. It is a nice size for the car not a full sized book, but it has plenty of pictures and pages. The pages are nice and thick, so they won't rip as well.We are practicing the animal noises all the time!"
1,Weak,"I was very disappointed with this book. The word selection was okay, but the pictures were weak. The child laughing and crying were a stretch. Some of the pictures seemed misleading. It was sloppy. The tractor picture was the worst picture of a tractor I have ever seen. The picture of book and read were similar but not distinct enough. The bathtime section, when is a toilet part of bathtime? Who has a rainbow rubber ducky?? Their rattle was the worst rattle I have ever seen. Soft toy, when in that part of a baby's vocabulary? They picked a guinea pig as one of their pets? Yes, a pet but it seemed too advanced for one of the first 100 words. Weak."
3,Small,Excited to give this book to my little guy for Christmas. The pictures and colors are great but it is much smaller than I thought it was going to be.
2,not non-stick,"I like the size of these pans, and for the first few times I used them they were non-stick. I bake bread weekly, and after a few months they got more and more sticky, to the point where I lose half my loaves stuck in the bottom of the pans. Cleaning, as you can imagine, is a pain since they are so sticky.I bought these pans for ease in cleanup and so I wouldn't have to grease my pans, but it looks like I'm right back where I started. I would go with another product if you are looking specifically for something non-stick."
2,"Not Red Capets usual ! Linda Knoxville, TN",I have ordered so many item from Red Carpet and most of them are Wind Spinners. This one is really not very appealing.Will continue to order because I know they have better.
5,Wild Violin,What amazing violin playing-this record is like Jimi Hendrix on violin--really rocks---sounds like african music with jazz violin..very cool
5,Looking for ideas,My wife has a closet full of dresses from her days as a brides maid. I bought her the book just to find ideas about other uses! From the initial read I think Ms. Whitlinger is on to something very big!
5,Too FUNNY!!!,"Ms. Whitlinger truly and humorously demonstrates ""you can wear that dress again!"", while at the same time, supporting a good cause! I have read the book several times...still picking it up when I need a good laugh! Keep it coming Rebecca!!"
1,"Get a life, I notice that only one dress is worn.","If the author has only been in one wedding party, I can see why. What is the obsession with this particular dress? Jealousy? Anger? My fiance laughed and then thought ""Have I picked out dresses that will invoke this respone? Would anyone I consider a friend do this to me? Give me an idea what type of emotion drives such an obession."
5,"Original, outre, and on the edge!","What a hoot! From the sublime to the ridiculous, Rebecca has captured it all in this amusing little book chronicling the many lives of a bridemaid's dress! No one is immune from the author's gentle barbs (including herself), as she and her dress venture into new territory. I especially loved the ""tips."" Just gave it to a bride-to-be as part of her shower gift; she said it was wonderful! Helps you look at life through a slightly skewed, but brand new prism."
5,what a great times,"I saw the movie for the very first when I was [...] (around 1991) and since that time I'd loved it.it's really fun. maybe today not to many people knows about this movie, but I really recomend it!"
1,Falls Flat,"Aging, Dylan obsessing baby boomer takes his teenager on a car trip. A one dimensional documentary of a road trip taken by white, middle class, status-quo folk. I was excited when I saw the title, ""I thought Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"", I thought ""Grapes of Wrath"", I thought ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". I thought, ""Characters, baby, situations man."" But no, McKeen writes dialog like someone who, well, tries to write dialog from an armchair. He keeps talking about Gonzo, but man he could take a few lessons on keeping it real, keeping it desperate, keeping it edgy and tough. Hell, he won't even settle for a regular old domestic beer in his book. How real is that? This book sags like middle age paunch over a coach belt."
4,Great read but my copy is missing pages 309-340,"I have been reading this book and thoroughly enjoying it, having just read The Sun Also Rises, To Have and Have Not and A Moveable Feast. Unfortunately, when I got almost to the end, to the Summer of 1925, I discovered that 32 pages are missing from my copy. Not torn out, just not included. This of course is one of the juiciest parts of the book and includes the appearance of Pauline Pfeiffer, who became Hemingway's second wife. I do not seem to be able to return it to Amazon as it has been more than 30 days since I first bought it, but it seems to me either Amazon or Norton should make this right. Very frustrating!"
3,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book, really finding out more about this point in Hemingway's life. And the author does give you lots of details, BUT, the author seems like he has a fairly low opinion about Hemingway in places in the book and his opionion comes through. I bought the book to read about Hemingway, not the author's opinion about Hemingway."
4,good desk.,"I purchased this desk for my little girl (4 years old). I wanted something she could do her puzzles on but that would be sturdy enough for her tom-boy ways. She like it, but not to sit at. She like to bang the flip down desk part down cause it makes a loud noise. Yet the things stays together and is still in one piece :) All the step 2 products I have bought are very well built and sturdy."
4,"Good, but cheap plastic","A bit flimsy, easy to assemble; for the price I thought it'd be a bit more heavy in the way of plastic. However, kid likes it!"
4,Great art desk for toddlers!,"I thought it might be too early to buy an art desk for my toddler, but went ahead anyway. I am so glad I did as she absolutely loves it. I sneak blank paper onto the easel at night sometimes and she is always thrilled to find a blank sheet to work on in the morning. Lots of convenient places to store things. I even put the thing together myself with just a Phillips screwdriver. Great item!"
4,heavy made!,Sturdy enough to with stand my 2 yr old and 4 yr old boys. Also easy to clean and very well organized.
1,not worth your money,"people say that she's an individual and she's different from the rest, but someone who follows the trend of ""hot topic"" -esque clothes, and sings supposedly ""punk"" music like 8/10ths of the artists on MTV is by no means an individual of this era of music. bland, and disgustingly immature - not worth your money. please, this is just another form of mainstream music to generate money by feeding to the popular trends of the teenage generation of today."
5,Let Go With Avril Lavigne,"Avril Lavigne's first Cd came out just a few weeks ago, but already it's opened our eyes to some good tunes. Avril Lavigne is a punk/skater girl from Napanee Ontario with an amazing voice and talent for the guitar. Being only seventeen she's prooved to be much more than just a airheaded celebrity.""Let Go"" (the title of her CD) really lets us get in touch with Avril's true self. Her songs range from the wicked punk rawk sounds of ""Sk8er Boi"" to the sad and thought-provoking ""I'm With You."" All the songs on her CD give us a sense of what it's like to be yourself against the majorities.Already Avril's debut song ""Complicated"" has tore up the charts sitting at #1 on Much Music's Countdown and there's a lot more #1's in store for this punk rawk queen in the near future."
1,"if she was fat, would you listen to her music?","if she was fat and ugly and played the same music, would you listen to it? most likely, no."
1,Great for brainless Teenage Girls!,"This crappy music is perfect for teenage girls. Avril is a fake bad girl singing horrible music. Yet it lets the listener think they are hearing a rebel in action when they are really hearing safe, boring, pop. Get this for your daughter if you want her to feel like a rebel without really rebelling. Even Britney is more true to herself then this junk. If you want to hear a real woman sing get something by Alanis Morrisette. She knows how to play pop with an edge."
5,Great CD,This girl is only 16? Amazing. I think it is a fantastic cd. This is the year for the young beautiful female singers and it's about time!
1,Ha Ha,"This is hilarious. How dare this chick from Canada parade around thinking she is Johnny Thunders or Sid Vicious. She thinks she is so punk, strutting around with her dumb guitar and singing dumb lyrics with awful titles like the unbearably cheesy Sk8ter Boi. Talk about dumb. But there are moments on the CD when she wnders into the territory of being not-bad-enough-to-make-you-puke. But it still is almost hilarious that this pompous little girl wanders around thinking she is SO punk. It ain't gonna happen. Go back to where ya belong, little idiot."
1,"If there was ever an album worthy of ZERO stars, this is it","Avril Lavigne is a shrill, pointless little girl trying to act like she's musically gifted. Sadly, she is not original to any degree. Her songs are cliche and her false presentation of herself as the anti-Britney is disgusting. Perhaps I'm the only person who saw her hanging out with Nikki Hilton and Nicole Richie on ""Celebrities Uncensored."" For someone who likes to act like she is above the industry, she sure does succumb to it rather easily. The saddest fact is that Avril has convinced herself that she is an ""artist,"" but she's a sham through and through. Just [try to] listen to the agonizing ""Sk8ter Boi"" and it will become instantly clear that this is one of those CDs that one is embarrassed to have purchased later in life."
1,A Horrible Album,"This cd is a sad disappointment to the 3 singles that she has released (""Complicatd"", ""Sk8er Boi"", and ""Losing Grip""). Now, I don't like to sound like someone's mom, but it sounds like Avril is just yelling her lungs out, while her band plays background music. It's absolutely atrocious. Aside from that, Avril doesn't even sound like she does on her cd. In real life, she sounds worse! If you watch the Video Music Awards 2002, she is performing and you can't hear her above her band very well. In addition to that, she sounds like she's dying or something. She is the worst person who has tried to sing since the Stone Age! Aside from most of the cd, the only good songs are her 3 singles, and that's why she released them; because they're the only good songs on her album."
3,Good but not great,"I have somewhat of a love/ hate point of view when it comes to Avril Lavigne and her music. On one hand I really like her songs, ""complicated"" and ""I'm with you"" - ""Sk8erBoi"" is okay. I don't like the rest at all. I also like the fact that she managed to make her dreams come true at such a young age.Yet on the otherhand, she is really shooting herself in the foot by putting down some of the hottest artists and music and I'm sure she's feeling the heat somewhat. And sadly, all of the rumors that she is fake, that she doesn't play the guitar, can't write, can't skate and so forth, are all somewhat true.In short she has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing more. It would kinda suck if she were just a one hit wonder and faded away into history at such a young age. I think that she should respect her peers though, in order to avoid rough waters."
5,it is the best,"this cd is the best out of all the cds this has got to be my favorite i mean i listen to it everyday and i would hope that someday i could be just like her, her songs just made me feel like i was there when that was happening or goin on i just love her and her music thats all i got to say so Rock On! and follow ur dream u never know what might happen"
5,In One Word: Amazing,"The album Let's Go, by new comer Avril Lavigne is one of the best new albums to be let out this summer. Her single complicated isnt not even an example of how good her album is. The song ""Tomorrow"" and ""I'm with You"" are examples of how much of a talented writer this 17 year old is. The songs speak to the listener.. ""Sk8er Boi"" and ""My World"" are the funky songs that also hold some meaning. This album is wonderful.. Its one of those albums that teenagers can look to and listen to and know that there is someone other then them out there that has the same problems as they do.."
5,Not Complicated,"Avril Lavigen showed the world that freshman albums rock and so do skater boys, punk and ties. Her first single track two on Let Go ""Complicated"" was anything but. With strong lyrics and a perfict message for todays teens sufering from identiy crisis she did amazing. The lyric's ""Your not fooling any one when you become some body else round everyone else"" deffinitly shows that Avril is going to go far with her music and stick around. Other songs on her cd that really make an impact are tracks one (Loosing Grip with the lyrics ""You werent there when I was scared"") and track 12 which talks about a boy being lame because he chose weed over her. All of her songs either have an awesome message or there just plain fun like Skater Boy. Avril is going to be a roll model for all girls to look up to. I think everyone should get her cd because shes on fire."
1,Music is dead,"Once I heard what some ""critics"" consider good music, I felt ashamed of the music industry. The image she presents in contrast to her music don't fit. She looks like she is going through a childhood phase and her music sounds like it is too. Originality in mainstream music has died and I'm severely disappointed when I hear of someone that proclaims that they are original like Avril Lavigne. It's ridiculously typical and just by a change of instruments, it can be borderline country music but not just any country music, typical country music. This is not music. This is no better than bubble gum teen pop. In fact, it has sunk to a deeper level. This is selling out people and there is no complexity to the music and to the riffs or scales I've heard. I've heard all this crap before. Obviously she can sing. But she is way too easily amused if this is what she ""honestly"" believes is music."
3,Whatever,"People say you either hate her or you love her. Avril Lavigne might [be bad] in reality, but she's ok on the cd. That's all I care about. She has some mad annoying songs, like Sk8er Boi, which is way overrated and way too punk-wannabe. However, there are some nice songs like My World and Complicated. No wonder the Complicated - Techno Remix got into the fifa 2003 soundtrack. The rest of the songs would be good also, if only their lyrics weren't as [bad]and punk oriented.Overall, some good songs, but nothing special. Just some enterainment that some people like to hear now and then."
2,"Avril is the three H's: Horrible, hypocritical, and a hoax","I don't get why any moron would like Avril Lavigne. No one at my school likes her. I find Michelle Branch to be much more talented, yet she is under similar artists.You know, I wrote a review on the same product, and I think this CD is boring and bland. A boring acoustic guitar, bland lyrics, horrid singing.If Avril would just drop the ""i'm a bad sk8er grrl and totally punk"" act, I think I would like her a little more.Why I gave it two stars is because The songs are okay, but they just have no depth to them. They are just boring and about the same topic. Nuff said."
1,supposedly 0 star for a non star!,"What a lyric! ""She was a girl, He was a boy"" whichever comes first I don't care. No sense at all! Avril is a poser! she can't sing and this girl wears hideous clothes! ""Sk8r Boi or Boy"" whatever! is a song for non-intelligent people. The lyrics to most of her songs especially the cuts made for singles can make people dumb by just listening to it. Simple. Don't buy the record as it totally has no substance at all following the very first track!"
2,all posing aside,"Avril Lavigne may be a poser but she has reached something in American teenagers. I bought this album when I was a poor, misguided radio addicted baby and I loved it. Avril has mastered the G chord and the contrived lyric. Not to mention the whole girls wearing ties thing she started. If you are a fan of pop music, buy this CD, I'm sure you'll love it but if you like good music avoid it."
5,ROCK ON AVRIL!,"Ok...lets just say that this cd ROCKS!!! alright, so some of the songs are slow, but you have to a few on every cd dont you? Seventeen-year-old Avril Lavigne put out an incredible debut album as she is falling into the musical world. The songs are all about how she feels period. Thats it. She is not trying to sell her body or looks, just her music and who cant respect that after all the Britneys have come and gone? This cd is amazing and uplifting and describes many of the real life situations that teens go through today. She is nobody but Avril Lavigne and who wouldnt be down with that?"
5,"""Let Go"" is the RADDEST CD, eh?",I don't just like this CD I love it! Her exceptional voice makes her an individual in the music industry! Avril's songs have touched me like no other artist! Each song can define any mood you are in! I felt that I got to know her through her songs! It amazes me how she wrote all the songs instead of singing someone else's lyrics! What other new artist can do that! She's also Canadian which is an extra Bonus! Way to go Avril!
1,stupid posers... she deserves NO stars,"We don't need anymore of this crap, we have enough, if i could i would put no stars because that is what she deserves. If she had written the songs herself, then MAYBE one, but she has an annoying voice and that crap about not wanting to learn how to play the guitar correctly is crap. She needs to grow up A LOT before she can be taken seriously. She is too old to be dressing and acting like she is a 10 year old at a blink 182 concert. I agree with this ""uncle lester"" and there is much better music to listen to than this crap. You want good music? then go out to a local club and listen to the bands in your area who are struggling to make it and even bring home enough money to eat! that is REAL music... along with the greats like led zep and the beatles and metallica. this cd is NOT worth your money or time."
1,What kind of a name is Avril anyway?,"She can't even spell. Say it with me, ""B-O-Y."" Plus, she's shallow, since she only wants him once he's famous, and she dumb--dumb--dumb--dumb. Vocal chord removal is the only option. Also, someone ought to steal all her pencils so that she can't write all that dumb stuff. Then, last of all, fill her ears with cheeseballs and her nostrils with sorbet. Tie her up and beat her up and throw her out of Babylon. And she has a funny nose. Worse than Michelle Kwan's. And weird eyes. She looks like a demon. Is she into Satanic worship? I met her at the mall once and she was wearing a pentagram necklace and black lipstick and she was singing, ""Oops, I did it again"" by Britney Spears. So she's really just a little teenie-bopper. Get a life. Get two of them. Get a whole barrel of lives. Go off to Zanzibar with your Skater Boi and if you ever come back, we'll kill ya!"
3,A pleasant suprise.,"When I first heard the songs ""Complicated"" & ""Sk8er Boi"" I didn't care for Avril's music. I thought it was too commercial and had no feeling, although the lyrics were cute. When I heard ""I'm With You"" I thought, ""who is that?"". Then I found out it was Avril and said, ""O.K. now were getting somewhere!"" I thought she was going to be all about premanufactured, pop ... like everyone else, but my opinion changed when I listened to the songs that the radio stations didn't choose to play. The first song ""Losing Grip"" is awesome in my opinion, ""I'm With You"" is my second favorite, and ""Mobile"" is probably my third. Radio stations seem to pick the songs they think will be most commercial and play them without giving reference to the more interesting and obscure music from an artist. I think they did that with ""Complicated"" & ""Sk8ter Boi"". Just buy the CD and choose the songs you like for yourself. I would recommend this CD if you like a sweet vocal with a harder edge."
3,Not all that great,"Avril Lavigne might have an image as fake as any artist out there, but I don't judge music by the artist. With that said, I really only found a handful of the songs on this album worthwhile.Avril says that she writes music based on the way she feels at the time, this at least seems to be true. She is still a teenager trying to find herself and it shows. Almost all of the songs are about her in some way. Which would be fine if she were more in tune with who she is. The lyrics to some songs might have even worked with better musical arrangements or tempos.But in the end - I could hardly stand to get through all but 4 or 5 of the songs. Avril shows some promise, but doesn't deliver."
3,It's not THAT bad!,"Geez! I can't believe some of the really horrible reviews I've read. Granted, this little pop/punk starlet is no Streisand, C. Dion or Karen Carpenter when it comes to vocal talent and certainly is not near as talented as America's new idol Kelly Clarkson, but she is not as awful as some reviewers have said. She is certainly better than Pink, her music is much more refreshing than that of Alanis ""I hate everybody so I'm going to depress you with my so-called music"" Morisette and has more substance than Britney Spears and that loathsome woman who can't find her clothes, Jennifer Lopez. I am of the days when singer/songwriters were actually great - Carly Simon, Carole King, Joan Baez, etc. We have only one of those now - Sheryl Crow. So, why do I like this CD - it is good, mindless bubble-gum punk, pop with a hard edge. If you like her hit ""Complicated,"" you'll probably not be disappointed in the rest of this CD."
2,Wow.,"Either Avril writes the worst lyrics ever or she should fire the person that writes them for her. ""I like you the way you are when we're driving in your car."" ?!?!?!?!? Please."
3,Info,"Does it matter if people write the lyrics to their own songs - or even the notes for that matter? No! My man Miles Davis didn't write some of his songs but still turned in some wonderful music. Musicians in an orchestra don't write their symphonies and they still turn in excellent music.How about we just let people like what they want. ""Good music is that which is pleasing to the ear."" I think this well-known composer offers a perfect working definition since it allows for subjectivity, which is what music is. I've had enough elitist pseudo-know-it-all complaints about music for this lifetime.As far as Avril goes, I don't care for it, but music is music and someone else will.End of rant."
5,Avril is amazing,"At first when I heard the song on the radio, I thought it was good. But then I started hearing ""Complicated"" over and over again, and I don't know why but the song became better and better each time I would listen to it. So, I finaly bought her cd ""Let Go"". When I heard the whole album I was amazed, and I wanted to know more about Avril. So I went on her website to see her biography, and when I read that she was 17 years old and that she was from Canada, I was shocked. I would of never imagine that Avril would have made it sooo far, but she did and I'm very happy for her. I just want to say that her album is excellant and everyone should buy it. She has an amzing voice and she's very special (in her own way)."
4,Let Go,"Not your typical teeny bopper cd....I strayed from buying this because I thought this would be another bubble-gum pop cd, but it's definitely not. The cd has a little edge. A couple of songs show her age, but overall I am impressed with this cd."
3,good but forgetable,"I bought this album for the song ""complicated"" then after awhile the song got annoying. so eventually the cd broke and i didnt care haha"
4,Nice CD!! Avril IS COOL.....,"Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come!!! You wont be disappointed."
3,she is not punk,"This album is decent, but she is young and she is learning. I feel that this is just the beginning of her career. Her lyrics are very good especially the song ""naked"". But there is no way that she is punk at all anyone who says she is, does not know true punk. The album is good and she is young so just wait for when shes older, it will be so much better."
1,this some kind of joke???,"This is not punk( even though all punk/pop sucks) and she is not rock!!!! well all the little 8 year old preps that want to ""rebel"" will love this crap its pahetic, somebody please keep her from writing another album DO NOT BUY THIS!!!In conclusion i think its pathetic that they let her play Metallica's ""fuel"" at there tribute show on mtv but wait i think its pathetic that they would let her play any metallica song."
1,avril should learn something from kurt cobain ..,"she should kill herself, or get her boyfriend/girlfriend to kill her. she sucks at acting like she's making music. just a canadian ashlee simpson with a guitar and trying to be punk.oh wait, kurt cobain made good music.....avril didnt/doesnt.seriously though, i'd be happy if she died (and i know i'm not alone on that)."
5,Skeptics READ!,"Ok I started out a hater of Avril Lavigne, they played Complicated to DEATH here. But, despite my better judgement, I listened to this album cuz my friend gave it to me as a gift, begging me to listen. So, bleh, I went into my room, popped it in and listened. And, HOLY BEGEEBUS, I love it! Losing my Grip is one of my FAVORITE songs now. So now, when people diss Avril just for being mainstream and popular, I have to say - Give her a CHANCE. ;)"
2,~>Ducky*s Review<~,"This CD is rather dumb as I word it. The songs are very boring, you'd probably spend most of your time skipping through the tracks trying to find at least a good song. None of the other songs sound like complicated. The other songs all sound like country/pop like a more edgy version of Shania Twain of some sort. The lyrics are very childish something that everybody could write themselves. The songs aren't something you could actually bang your head to (if you want to that is). To sum this up just think of Faith Hill with a horrible voice with the southern sounding theme. It sounds just like what Avril said after she denied that she called it punk, she called it New Country <~~ and that's exactly what it is."
1,"A Viewpoint from a real ""sk8ter""","I trust that all of the people under me are under the age of 13 because as I see it these people have the I.Q. equivalent of a puppy. As the title above me says, ironically, I skateboard. I love skateboarding and as the masses and their ignorant selves decide to flock to it for their own greedy uses, I get sick. People like Avril Lavigne should be tortured ala Abu Gharib style. Music has now been sunk to the point where stereotypes and sex sell. And what better way than using a young girl who is a ""sk8ter punk"". I applaud the Matrix for crafting pop songs for a puppet and showing the world that you don't need talent to make it big (also see most female popstars 80-04 i.e. Kylie Monogue). If you have any sense of pop music then listen to the Velvet Underground's Loaded, or the Flaming Lips to truly understand music with catchy riffs and good song writing."
5,Another gifted young lady !,"Hello Avril, You are a very gifted and talented young lady. I'm sure that you will be an extremely successful musician since you're already off to such a fantastic start. Your voice is beautiful and you have a really refreshing originality to your music and I love how ""real"" your songs are. It's about time someone like yourself made it in the music business. By the way, I'm probably old enough to be your mom, and I think that your style is fantastic. Also I have to ask if you are related to anyone in Michigan, U.S.A. as we share the same last name, and my mother and grandparents on her side were from Canada also. I wish you all the best in your career, take it to the highest place that Heaven will allow as you sing like an Angel!"
4,Great Cd,"I like the CD but it isn't my favorite. I usually like more rock, pop-punk, alternative or that kinda stuff , but I like this Cd anyway. I persnally liked the second album more which is pop/rock ad I would recommend this to you if you like more pop, but if you tend to be more rock like me i would say listen to Under my skin. I especially like the songs Complicated, Anything but Ordinary, My World, Things I'll never Say and Nobody's fool. She write great lyrics, is talented and has a good voice."
3,It is not what it is said to be,"Avril Lavigne sings great and her songs are catchy and positive. There is only one problem, she puts out this image of being a total punk/skater chick who isn't going to change herself to get you to like her, but her music is pop.It sounds like Britney Spears learned how to play guitar from sum 41 and got vocal lessons from alainis morriset. She might write it well, and play a guitar, but isn't what she is said to be, If her true style is pop then don't put the image out of being punk. Let Go is still a good CD if you like pop. if you like punk don't be fooled."
5,"Great book, great teacher","I had the great fortune to study under Michael Walker at the College of Santa Fe. He is definitely one of the brightest lights around - a teacher and writer of the first caliber. If you have any access to his mind, via lecture, this book, online, or otherwise, and you have a true desire to write and write well, take that opportunity. Power Screenwriting (then in a mimeographed and spiral bound form) was the first book I was exposed to on screenwriting and it continues to be the ONLY one that I refer to again and again. Well done, Michael!"
3,OK for the price,"I want to start by saying, MY star system goes as follows:5 star: Perfect in every way, hardly ever happens! If give it 5 stars, buy it right now!4 star: Very good but has very minor deficiencies that are easy to overlook.3 star: Good, but has some minor deficiencies and maybe a problem that can be overlooked. Still a good value but there may be something better out there.2 star: Problems and deficiencies are bad, buy it only if you have no alternative.1 star: Don't buy the product, it's badness is so huge it actually bends space time endangering us all! I don't recall ever giving a product 1 star!The good...It works and is not the most expensive out there.The bad...A little flimsy, it didn't break but it feels like cheap shoe strings.This is a value proposition. It does what it is supposed to and I am certain it will last as long as the original did...one year. And the original seemed like it was well made."
2,I found this book to be old-fashioned and uninformative,"I read this book to get better insights into my own 4-year-old son, but I was very disappointed. It is full of gross generalizations, without many caveats that not all 4-year-olds are alike. I took a few pieces of information away from the book (which is why I gave it 2 stars), but for the most part, I found the content to be out of date and preachy. She also uses ""he"" and ""him"" exclusively, which, although I do have a son, I found difficult to ignore."
1,THE GREATEST DEATH METAL CD EVER,"Now this is death metal, not that silly cannibal corpse, and venom stuff.Backstreet is the sickest most morbid deathmetal band everYa right p.s Death metal sucks"
5,Never gone indeed!,"The Backstreet Boys have done it again! I have been a fan for a long time and I have to say this is the best ballad C.D. they have ever come out with. All the songs go straight to the heart. I would highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone. ""Weird World"" is a whole new sound for them and it suits them perfectly. I hope everyone enjoys this album the way I did."
5,Backstreet's Back Alright!,"Heck yes, the boys are back! Another Amazing cd from the best group ever!Keep the Backstreet Pride alive!!"
4,Never Gone~,"I was nervous when I first purchased this CD since it's been a couple years since the backstreet boys have been around. However, this CD is hot! The lyrics are filled with emotion and will brighten up your day. Definitely a CD to add to your collection."
1,This cd contains spyware,Do not put into your computerhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/usatoday/20051110/tc_usatoday/somesonycdspiracyprotectioncalledspywarehttp://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051110/wr_nm/sony_hack_dc
2,Not so good,"I was very disappointed in this CD, it doesn't have the same great sound of their old stuff!!"
1,Copy Protections means you can't use it,"The copy protection scheme wants to download programs to my computer and it won't let me copy the songs to my MP3 player. What is the point, if you can't use the music in your MP3 player? I'm not buying another MP3 player just to use their copy protection scheme."
1,"Good Songs, BUT, Bigger There's a Bigger Problem:","First let me say, that some of the songs are good on this CD, however, don't buy the CD version of ""Never Gone."" I tried to ""rip"" songs from the CD onto my computer, and now my entire CD skips and doesn't work. The reason why is because it has a copywrite (or however the hell its spelled) prevents you from doing so. If you dont believe me, click above where it says ""1 star"" for Reviews and you will see many others saying the same thing (maybe not CD getting f***ed up, but about the copywrite thing). So if I wanted to listen to the songs again, I had to buy them off of here. Good songs, but simply put, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!"
