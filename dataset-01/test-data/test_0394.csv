1,Horizontally focused,"That Wilkes includes both an entry for Chicago's Old St. Pat's, a veritable showcase of bizarre, 70's-style liturgical abuses, and a reflection on liturgical dance, an innovation absolutely prohibited from celebrations of the Western/Latin rite (see ""Notitiae"" 11 [1975] 202-205, Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship), should give you some indication of the ideological thread that runs through this book. The parishes highlighted here are precisely the sort of horizontally-focused places that prompted Pope Benedict's pending and much-needed ""reform of the reform."""
2,Save your money and buy Dr. Schwarzbein's Principle,"Suzanne's premise is a good one, however, the food combining is too difficult so people are unlikely to stick to this regimen in the long run. I read Dr. Schwarzbein's Principle after Get Skinny, and it is very well written and easier to follow. I only want to lose about 8-10 lbs and have lost 6 lbs in the last 4 weeks on the Principle Plan. Plus, I am not denying myself pasta with meat sauce and cheese, bread and butter, real sandwiches etc. Get Skinny is basically Dr. Schwarzbein's eating plan with a new (and questionable) food combining theory."
4,easy to understand,"Friend at work was raving how she was losing weight, feeling good, etc. I bought the book (she told me to go to Amazon.com) and started new way of eating on 8/28/99. Only had 10 lbs i wanted to lose, but when you are short waisted and over 60, that represents a big roll around the waist. Took it slow and easy and before the end of the year I had lost 14 lbs, went from elastic waist size 12 to nice size 10 clothes, tucked in blouses. Stay away from funky foods most of the time, except Sat nite eating out is my Treat Night. Usually sour dough bread.My cholesteral went from 220 (while eating tons of ""low fat"" food) to 204 fr the first time ever. Even though I eat real butter, etc. My husband lost 20 lbs and looks great. The book is easy to understand -- P.S. Did not start the bread or funky foods until i reached my goal. it is easy to stay on level one when you watch the pounds melt off and the roll of fat disappear!"
3,Good cookbook,"This is just the beginning. Take this information about food combining seriously. If you want to really understand how to use food combining and WHY you should, read Dr. M Ted Morter's book ""Your health, Your choice"" or Theodore Baroody's book, ""Alkalize or Die"". They are well written, simple to understand and contain excellent information. Skinny is only one piece of the puzzle; overall health is the ultimate goal!!"
3,"Great recipes, not so great weight loss","This book contains many great recipes, but after following the plan to the letter I only lost 6 pounds after 6 weeks. I find it hard to believe that so much cheese and high-fat dairy product will not turn out to be bad for your arteries in the long run. I've recently lost weight by eating less and exercising more. I've incorporated more vegetables and whole grains with low glycemic index ratings. I highly recommend this book for a cookbock but as a weight loss plan it truly failed for me. (Like other reviewers I also got tired of hearing about the author's ""perfect life"" and many trips.)"
1,"Great idea, but it just doesn't work.","I bought this book and was really upbeat about it. After trying the program for a period of time I have discovered that it just doesn't work. And, no, I didn't ""cheat."" I ate no sugars, white flours, or ""funky foods."" My advice would be to save your money and NOT buy this book."
4,Help! Not loosing fast enough,I think the program is very good and is easy to follow. My problem is that I am not loosing as quickly as I thought I would. I have only lost 6 pounds in 5 weeks. Can anyone help me? E mail fvaughan@viningsparks.com
5,AWESOME Book!,"I have read this book twice. I'm an educated person with a college degree. I understand biology. This diet is not another fad! It's healthy, and VERY satisfying and delicious! I'm truly glad that I purchased it, and I'm purchasing more for family members! Suzanne is a very intellegint woman, and so is the doctor that taught her this philosophy of nutrition!"
3,Great book but not so great results,"I've been on this plan now for 2 weeks and I only lost 1 lb. I' m following everything like Suzanne sais in the book. I also have a terrible lower back pain all the time and I'm exeperiencing frequent urination like never befor in my life . Could be that something is wrong with my kidneys,due to this diet? Does any one have the same problem? Please somebody tell me..... I read about all this people loosing so much weight so fast and I don't understand why I'm not. Thanks for whoever want to answer me."
1,Bad for me,I bought this book and tried the recipes but I got sick in my stomach. My first day I tried the onions and eggs and it made my stomach flip flop all day and it was bad. The next two days I tried others and when I went to bed at night my stoamch hurt me so bad and everytime I moved my food came back into my mouth and both nights I sat straight up and almost up chucked on my husband. If your stomach can not tolerated that much grease and onions do not try this book. If you have a cast iron stomach then by all means give it a whirl. I just wanted to slim down like Suzanne but I guess not this time around. Good luck!
3,"Great recipes, not so great weight loss","This book contains many great recipes, but after following the plan to the letter I only lost 6 pounds after 6 weeks. I find it hard to believe that so much cheese and high-fat dairy product will not turn out to be bad for your arteries in the long run. I've recently lost weight by eating less and exercising more.

(Like other reviewers, I also got tired of hearing about the author's ""perfect life"" and many trips.)"
4,It works! I need EASIER recipes and ideas. Please HELP!,"I am 26 years old and just had my 2nd child in Feb. I gained 46 pounds during the pregnancy + I already had 30 pounds to lose before I got pregnant. I bought this book in May and immediately lost 15 pounds. I haven't lost anything since then and was hoping someone out there could help me. I am starting to cheat out of frustration and I need more meal ideas. My family is sick of eating salad. It seems like the only thing I make for dinner is chicken or fish with some kind of veggie or salad. I need more ideas with less fancy ingredients. If anyone out there is reading this, please email me @ mccann@gte.net. Thanks, Julie from Atlanta."
4,Love it so far but have tons of questions! Stalled @ 9lbs.,"I loved the book and recipes at first. But after loosing 9lbs in a little under two weeks weight loss has stopped with no cheating. I have tons of questions...If a salad dressing shows 5g of sugar on the label but has no added sugar, honey, (funky foods) in the ingredients can this be eaten? Balsamic vinegar has 4g of sugar. Is there some guideline I've missed for label reading? Or is the rule 0g Carbs when pro/fats are involved and 0g sugar no matter what or where it comes from? I would love to hear from others who have plateaued and gotten past it. Also any help on sugar grams and label reading would REALLY be appreciated."
3,susan somers get skinny,"I think this book is a wonderful way to loose wait. But not to become a healthy eater. My girlfriend is using the weight loose tecnique explained in Susan Somers books, andis loosing weight.I thought it was great at first until I saw what she was eating, eggs, alot of high fat dairy products alot of high fat meats. All foods high in saturated fats. She is now hardley at all consuming enough bran and fibre she would need to keep her body in a healthy shape. Eliminating alot of vegetables that have important nutrients for the body.I know this way of eating is sucessful for wait loss, but at what cost. Her heart is taking a toll, and her colesteral level is probably skyrocketing.I'm sure there is a way she can loose wait with whole foods, ""good"" fats and excersise."
1,Get skinny on Liposuction,"Suzanne, The March 20th Enquirer shows you leaving a surgery center after having liposuction. When should we look for the ""Get Fat on Fabulous Food...then Have Liposuction"" book?"
1,Not a help,"I tried this pillow and couldn't get it situated to where I was any more comfortable. Pass this up and go for a Snoogle. It's a little more money, but worth it for the better night's sleep."
3,"Good concept, poorly stuffed","I was excited to finally get this in the mail. I think the shape is great and even though I am tall and have a long torso, it adequately fit from my knees to my belly. However I was very disappointed with how poorly stuffed it was upon arrival! My knees were still touching each other with the pillow in between them and it did not provide much support to my 5 month belly. I like the shape and idea, so I'm going to get some fill stuffing, and take it apart a bit and add some stuffing to my comfort. Not something I had expected to do for a $30 purchase, but it would cost too much to ship it back."
2,Suffing Separation,"I have this pillow. I got it when I was a few months pregnant. I admit I did like it at first although I did feel it was a little expensive for what a regular pillow could do. In the last few months though the stuffing has started to separate, especially where you would put it in between your legs. It has separated into two distinct chucks of filling. No matter how much I try to fluff it back together its not the same. So, its a nice pillow but don't expect it to last."
3,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to this pillow. I have enjoyed the other Boppy products I have purchased and was pleased with the slipcover and shape of the pillow. My disappointment was over the fact that after sleeping with this pillow for about two weeks the filling was so scrunched up and beaten down that the pillow was not very useful. Expected more out of the Boppy product.
3,Not worth buying on DVD,"If you liked this version so much, you're better off with the VHS. The video transfer on DVD is VERY bad, like seeing it on television, minus the clarity of cable tv.So far I haven't seen a movie that really did justice to Bronte's Jane Eyre. Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester was too caustic and gruff, even for Bronte's version, and the playful relationship he had with little Adele was not true to the book. Ciaran was at his best in Jane Austen's Persuasion, which I recommend to anyone who liked this movie. The BEST Rochester was probably Orson Welles' portrayal. Unlike Welles' movie, this version included Jane's interaction with St. John, which was a bonus.Best to rent this first for yourself before buying it."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"I am a fan of Ciaran Hinds, but he was a little too gruff, like Orson Wells, when he could've shown more of his sensitive side...but it must've been difficult to bring that out in him with his wooden and dowdy leading lady. I was annoyed with her by the end of the movie. They had no chemistry, and she had the personality of a woman suited to marry the town preacher.blah. Ciaran's eyes were worth watching it, that's all I've left to say."
1,The second worse verse of Jane Eyre,"I am a Jane Eyre fanatic, so it is with experience that I can say. . . this movie is not worth the time. I own the BBC and 1997 verse and those are the only two I could ever recommend(the BBC verse is the best). There is NOTHING about Mr Rochester's character that is appealing. In fact, they make him far to angry and unpleasent than he should be. The book portrays a broken man. For that reason, women are drawn to him. Not even in the most climaxtic scene am I convinced that he is truely in need of love. The whole movie felt cold and unfeeling!"
2,Inaccurate but mildly enjoyable,"More Harlequin romance than Charlotte Bronte novel, this is an agreeable enough production. The acting is decent but the script! Trite and overly dramatic, it made me wince every time. By all means get this for the light romance but don't mistake this for anything even close to Bronte's vision. The last two versions were much better."
5,Perfect match,Bought these in the event I required them to replace a missing handle. Now i have extras in the event i need them.
1,HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT,"This toy was awful. I bought this and baby anabelle. Baby Anabelle was adoreable. Our 3 year old loves the dress until It leaked ""potty"" all over it. Feeding this doll was awful. It is like trying to force feed a worm with a spoon. It never did potty on its chair. It did nothing but leak water all over for the price I paid I may as well have bought a hose. Please save your money. Baby anabelle was a much better doll."
4,"Attack on Yamamoto, by C. V. Glines (Aug. 4, 2001)","Glines reports on every aspect of the Yamamoto mission in painstaking detail, particularly on the decades-long debate regarding who actually shot down the admiral's plane. Indeed, barely half of the book covers the mission's planning and execution; the rest consists of in-depth analysis of every conceivable piece of information and speculation on the buring question as to who should get credit for the kill. If the reader just wants a comprehensive, overall history of the mission and its background, there may be better choices. ""Get Yamamoto,"" by Burke Davis fills that bill nicely. But if you want a book that is thorough to the last possible detail with regard to the post-mission controversy, this is the one."
3,It's Okay,Covers too many subjects. I was hoping for a book more about shotguns and less about shotguns and hunting.
4,Facts that would be dull for most,"Well, I liked this book. I also studied linguistics in college. Its a very good book if you are interested in the subject. I enjoyed seeing some history and practical basic linguistic theory. If you are not a linguist, some of these concepts may be over your head. Its a great book for displaying on your bookshelf to make people think you are smart, too."
1,Too basic!,The book reflects a very basic grammar. The test was 10 times harder than the sample tests that were on the book. I would not recommended at all.
2,WQill not work between XP an XP computers,"Although it doesn't say it will, it also doesn't explicitly say that it won't work as a transfer cable between two XP machines. For most software and options XP and Vista are interchangeable and if it says it can transfer between XP and Vista, I think it is logical to assume that between two XP machines would also be possible.. Having bought this item, I then find on the documentation, that NO it will only work between XP and vista.I just think it should have been written as an explicit point in the description. Even better.. publish the documentation as part of the product description.I have now found two cables that should work between two XP machines. The Tornado and Targus ACC96US High-Speed File Transfer Cable. I am waiting on the Targus."
4,Tragic Story -- Well Told,"A heart-wrenching tragic story, well-told.Good supporting documentation -- a fine overview of the campaign which destroyed the Army of Tennessee in a gruelling, marching, fighting, frontal-assaulting, suicidal attempt at the impossible.A must read for anyone who thinks the war was decided at Gettysburg. Every bit as much tragedy, three times the loss of life, and four times the distance marched, and in horrible winter weather -- excellent history."
4,Vivid Account of The Battle of Franklin,"Whether you agree with Mr. Sword's assesment of General Hood or not, he is for the most part on the mark. Franklin was a useless battle that ranks with Cold Harbor, the crator and the third day at Gettyburg as meaningless slaughter. A more balanced, but less vivid account of Franklin is offered in ""Five Tragic Hours"" by James Lee McDonough. Read them both."
3,Not Very Helpful,"This book allowed me to evaluate my procrastination issues pretty accurately, but I didn't really gain any more insight into them. It did a good job at telling me what I already knew. Most of the suggestions it offers seem pretty good, but I had trouble sticking with them. This book has basically motivated me to kick the procrastination habit, but I'm not motivated enough to actually start doing it. Although, I am more aware of my problem now."
3,"""Great book about procrastination--not much spark""","If you want to know the types of procrastination, or the causes of procrastination-then this is the book for you. As for myself, I enjoy the kind of book that makes me feel like running a marathon-before, during, and after reading it. The thought kept running through my mind as I read this book, that I should write a book myself. Oh, maybe someday I'll write one. There is a lot of very useful information in this book, but I have read better books on the subject. Not a bad book, but I'll have to stick to my three star rating."
3,A pretty good read.,"This was a pretty good book. It's got me through the bornig lunches at work.Some of the stories are actually pretty good, and some missed the boat. The biggest problem i had with this book is the many typo's.Over all, I'd say get this book. Some of the stories have several plot twist that will keep your attention."
2,Tom Jones revisted,"I have to say with the exception of the albums bookends ""Here comes my baby"" & 'The first cut is the deepest"" I was disappointed with the album. Most of the album seems trapped in an endless sound of strings and brass that don't compliment the songs rather detract from them. If you like the Tom jones of the mid sixties, and trust me this is not anywhere near as good, you may find it listenable every now and then, otherwise I'd buy his later works. No revelations on this album, but a couple of rays of light that let you know there is a songwriter out there."
5,Sturdy,Does exactly what it is supposed to do and seems to be quite sturdy. Left me confident that it would stay in place and keep my little guy safe.
5,An Absolutely Essential Book for anyone into Rock Posters,"As a poster artist myself, I am thrilled and honored to be included in this book.This book is a mind-blowing achievement. I just finished (finally!) pouring through it for my first full time ... i think it's impossible to get through it all in one sitting (unless you have a week!). The design of the book is a work of art in itself. The posters pop off the pages - eye-candy galore. It is hands-down the quintessential, authoritative collection of modern poster art. I am also really excited to discover tons of artists I didn't know about before, and the international examples are an eye-opener, too. They've really thoroughly captured the whole scene."
3,Good Buy,"Have yet to read it, but it was a good buy. It is really heavy and would make a good coffee table book...something to think about."
3,Meh.,"This movie was quite the disappointment... even for a big Johnny Depp fan, it's just surprisingly boring and bad. Makes me sad!"
1,deviated from the original dark shadows by a football field.,someone did not watch the original dark shadows soap oprah this was far from the original. johnny depp and tim burton need a time out. I thought this movie was terrible and ended up falling asleep through it. I wish could get a refund 3.99 WAS WAY TO EXPENSIVE FOR THIS MOVIE.
5,Action pact fun mystery,"I love the Dark Shadows move; it was a great play off the old TV series! It would be hard to follow all the jokes unless you have seen the old series, but it is worth going back and watching. I enjoy seeing how Johnny Depp, can transform into any character, and take over any movie! Every character of the movie was perfect, and fit their role perfectly – love it!"
3,Good music and otherwise ok,"As a loyal fan of the original Dark Shadows, I was a disappointed in this remake. While keeping some characters true to the original, others and the overall plot just seemed lacking. There was some great 70s music which helped to keep the movie moving."
2,Some funny parts but mostly boring,It had great potentail. All the funny parts are in the previews. Watched 45 mins but it was SOOO boring I just turned it off. I don't know how it ended and it wasn't even worth looking up the ending.
2,ugh,"This was mostly just a really boring movie. It looked very funny in the trailer, but it just wound up being uncomfortably boring."
2,I Just Don't Get It Tim,I am a fan of the original series. I was really excited to see how Burton and Depp treated this as fans. But it was obvious from the get that they were trying too hard to make it their own and they just couldn't decide if they were going to go with comedy or camp. I would have enjoyed a really dark campy movie that would have bitten off the first say two to three seasons of Dark Shadows. They're eyes were too big and they over-extended themselves. Not to mention that their attempts at comedy and camp just ended up looking like bad writing and over production. I was not impressed. I did like Depp's look. That's one star and another star for including Alice Cooper (I won't spoil the surprise). But everything else is just blah.
2,Not Much Shadow,"""Dark Shadows"" was a soap opera back in the late 1960's whose characters had skeletons in their closet, literally. The original show had one of the first sympathetic portrayals of a vampire who wasn't all bad. The movie had promise with the campy acting, good atmosphere background music, and nice visuals. BUT, the characters were not treated well - the witch became a Superman arch-villain, the doctor (my favorite from the original TV show) was treated shabbily and opportunities for a real plot were just wasted. Changes from the original storyline didn't make sense and the ending of the movie was utterly forgettable. The filmmakers could have had a lot of fun with Barnabas' angst in not wanting to kill people and the whole haunted, dysfunctional family. Too bad, if they had done it right, they could have made more movies starring the Collins Family."
4,Fun Watch,"I thought this movie was Fun.... Not so much like the old series, which is a good thing. There's just enough nostalgia to make it a good laugh. Love J.D.!"
2,Hum Drum.,"Best parts of this film appear in the trailer. Very predictable story lines and unimaginative. Very slow and at times you wonder how much linger you have before the movie is over. Except for some funny lines, the movie is a loser."
2,Noooooooo,So disappointed with this film. Surfing the edge of comedy and dark plot makes the viewing just awkward and empty. Burton's worst film yet. Waste of time and money. :(
3,Just OK,"Was expecting more from this movie. Thought it would be funnier based on the previews, but really, the best scenes were probably what made up the preview. Story was a little slow, and the humor was lacking."
4,Dark Shadows,"Great entertainment , Great casting , Great Music . Watch it more than once to get all the entertainment values that are offered . . ."
4,Entertaining,"Johnny Depp is fantastic as Barnabus Collins...really entertaining movieFunny, suspenseful, all around fun movie for the whole family. I would recommend to anyone"
2,Worst of Tim Burton,"I love Tim Burton but this movie doesn't do Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, or Tim Burton any justice.Although, there were some funny scenes, the plot was ridiculous."
5,Dark Shadows,I started watching this movie with reservation about the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The dual have a reputation of pushing the story line to an extreme artistic limit.The movie surprised me and with exceptionally acted and directed. This may have been Tim Burton's best Movie. The acting and story line was beyond my expectation. Excellent movie all around.
1,Just awefull,What was this movie all about? Did all the funny parts get put into previews? This movie was not funny or entertaining. This is one of only a hand full of movies that I almost stopped watching. It seemed to have no rhyme or reason for anything. I rented this movie because I like Johnny Depp. I have liked a lot of his movies. This was a complete dud!I cannot in good concise even say it is rentable or a time waster. It is neither. Just skip this one.
1,Dark Shadows,I did not care for this movie. I know that it was a spoof but it was stupid. I would not recommend it.
3,Not the best not the worst,It was Average for me - Not their best work and not their worst. But Mr Depp is always fun to watch
1,well what can you expect,i bought this movie because i have always loved dark shadows. well barnabas collins this is not. i fell asleep watching it. anyone not familiar with the original dark shadows would probably enjoy it.
4,True to the TV show,"My daughter took me to this movie for Mother's Day. I watched the series on TV when I was young and didn't know what to expect. I found myself chuckling through the entire movie as very subtle references to the TV show were used as jokes all through the movie. The background music had me humming along, and the actors did a remarkable job at imitating their character based on the TV series actor. My daughter is a Johnny Depp fan, but not having seen the original TV series missed a lot of the subtle humor. It was a very enjoyable movie for me, but I guess you had to be a fan of the TV series to appreciate it."
4,Funny but serious movie,I loved the comedic touch and the serious tone of the movie. It's a good family movie and highly recommended.
3,Good but drawn out,This movie could have been 30 minutes shorter. The acting was cheesy even for Johnny Depp. I've never seen the cartoon but its got to be better then the movie.
4,Very funny throwback to the 70's,Don't know how I missed this movie when it came out in theatres but it is very well done. This is the perfect role for Johnny Depp. If you liked Sleepy Hollow you will love this. Very entertaining and the styles and music from the 70's add to the fun. Admit I have never watched the original series so cannot comment on that aspect but will definitely check them out now.
1,Warning *** This movie is a total Flop!,"I wasted money on a ""blue ray"" copy of this movie! I was not impressed. I thought it was a serious vampire movie. I enjoyed the first 15 minutes of this movie until it started to turn very flakey, dry and dull. The movie loses all credibility; it's like some retarded version of the Adams family! Please do NOT waste your time buying this trash. This is a warning. I was so angry and disappointed, that I actually threw my blue ray copy in the trash...but I did keep the jacket! Sorry guys but it's not a hardcore vampire movie...it's a joke is what it is. Thanks"
1,JOHNNY DEPP PLAYING THE SAME CHARACTER AGAIN AND AGAIN TIM BURTON ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GONNA WATCH THIS GARBAGE. DARK SHADOWS THE TV SERIES WAS A CLASSIC AND BARNABAS COLLINS A ICON.HEY JOHNNY DEPP AND TIM BURTON QUIT EMBRASSING YOURSELVES! IT IS A CRIME TO SEE THIS GREAT SERIES MADE SUCH A MOCKERYAND ALL I SAW WERE THE PREVIEWS. I WAS ACTUALLY EMBRASSED TRAPPED IN A MOVIE STORE HEARING THIS TRASH. JOHNNY DEPPYOU AIN'T ALL THAT ANYMORE. TIM BURTON AND JOHNNY DEPP ARE AS BAD AS THE ENDLESS FLOPS ADAM SADLER KEEPS PUTTING OUTHEY TIM BURTON----GET LOST!
2,Dark shadows,Mix between Edward Scizzorhand and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Not really worth seeing. Not like original and a weird storyline. Would have probably been better animated.
2,ok.,"poor story line. a little comedy here and there, but with not much quallity inbetween. my kids ages 8-14 thought it was ok, the younger ones were almost as bored as I was. My two boys found more humor in it than the rest of us, they are 14 and 13."
5,very good,I thought this movie was awesome and funny! it was refreshing to see a funny dark movie. I loved Johnny Depp in this role! I'm not to fond of these kinds of movies but it was def. awesome! I have never written a review about a movie on here before...so what does that tell u? lol love it! buy it! Johnny is adorable in it!
5,Genius at work!,I never get tired of Johnny Depp films! This one is particularly good! Really funny and always entertaining! A different take on your vampire films! You'll love it!
2,Not one of Johnnys better movies,I am a huge Johnny Depp fan but I would have to rate this along with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Had a great supporting cast but the movie just seem to drag on and on until the last 10 minutes. I know that he and Tim Burton can do alot better.
3,Funny - in a weird way,"I'm not particularly a Johnny Depp fan, but I enjoyed him in this movie.It's funny. it's bizzarre. It's entertaining. The plot is not exactly complex, but what do you expect from a movie of this genre?We watched this form Amazon Instant Video. No problems with the streaming, no problem with the download. Much, much better than driving to the video store!!!"
3,DARK SHADOWS,I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I WATCHED DARK SHADOWS AS A KID GROWING UP EVERYDAY. I FELT LET DOWN. I DID LIKE THE SEX SCENE THOUGH - HILARIOUS.
3,New Dark Shadows,Enjoyed the humor in the New Dark Shadows. Johnny Depp was great in the title role but suspected the ending.
2,Occassionally funny,"I had high hopes for this movie, afterall, Johnny Depp is in it. Unfortunately the movie often dragged and had little to no plot."
4,Fun to watch,It's just fun to watch-Not just teeth in neck type of stuff! Horror wasn't really a part of this movie.
2,Slowly boring and predictable,The movie starts well and slowly deteriorates. The ending couldn't come sooner and I would have preferred waiting to watch at no cost.
2,What a disappoinment!,"I really was expecting more about this movie because I'm fan of jhonny depp but this movie is really boring, Don't waste your money."
2,A Taste of Hollywood Mediocrity.,"I watched this movie in Theaters when it came out because I thought it would be funny based on the trailer. Remember how the trailer had 2 or 3 jokes, so did the movie. It literally had 3 jokes. When I was watching it with friends, I fell asleep about halfway through and woke up during the scene [SPOILER ALERT] where the little girl (don't remember her name) turned into a werewolf or something. When I was watching that, I wasn't sure what was going on. Basically, this movie is a mess. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
5,this movie is actually really good despite the harsh critics,"I cant believe it. the trailer made this movie seem like it would be soooo lame and corny. it made it seem like it would be a comedy with old fashioned humor. which is was i didn't want to see it in theaters but oh how i was wrongthis film is dark. lots of death. unexpected. the music makes it more. plot was good, goes into the life of the main character. the antagonist made you want to hate her.i recommend this film to all who want to see a dark story with a twist at the end."
2,fluff,"I had the time and figured it couldn't be as bad as everyone said. I was wrong. Dark Shadowns could have been a comedy if it had been funny, I'm not sure what they were aiming for but they missed the mark.We all know Johnny Depp loves his make up but this was so over the top, the only thing it had in common with the TV version of Dark Shadows was the name of the caracters. Very disappointing."
4,Amusing movie...,It didn't have an exciting plot but it had some funny moments. It helps to be a Johnny Depp fan.
1,"my name is........ahhh, what is this. let me get back in my grave","oh jonny, what have you done to our great dark shadows, you killed it. may the darkness of dark shadows haunt you for all time. this movie should have been so much better. A death no one would ever want. Should have checked with the fans of this great t.v show. You made a big mess. the movie, and the soundtrack. I am sure there wont be a Dark Shadows 2, because of you. YOU GOT IT ALL Wrong.So, R.I.P.....Jonny for such a mess of a movie. THE REAL DARK SHADOWS LIVES FOREVER. You got it wrong, and as movies go, you killed Dark Shadows. and your a fan????????? REALLY?"
2,WTF was that?,"Once upon a time Depp would do a masculine role. It seems with every Tim Burton product he becomes even more flamboyant then the last time. Sorry to say this movie was made for fans of queer eye. Burton you crossed the line with this induction of fecal matter into your collection.It had very few highs, and lower low points through out this utter waste of film. Save yourself the money and watch The nightmare before Christmas, back when entertainment meant something more.I realized 45 mins in, that this movie had no plot. I actually asked for my money back after it was over. I Felt traumatized, and victimized having sat threw the whole showing. My IQ has just dropped 3 points after viewing this film."
2,Should be buried,"This movie should suffer the plight of the protagonist and be buried for 200 years. it is unfunny at best. The highlight is Alice Cooper, but you can watch him elsewhere."
3,Comical,If you like Tim Burton then you'll really enjoy this movie!Classic Johnny Depp role very funny but serious acting
2,What a waste of Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's talents!,"Tongue-n-cheek is funny, that cannot be said for the any of the so called humor in this film. The acting is at times just bad and the plot...well, was there a plot?"
5,fantastic,"I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLY FUNNY AND WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE. JONNY DEPP IS JUST THE BEST ACTOR. HAVE SEEN HIM IN MANY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS, ALSO ENJOYED MICHELLE PHIFER."
4,Sarcastic and fun movie,"I thought there were a lot of great deadpan, sarcastic lines in this movie that made it an enjoyable version of the original storyline. This is definitely more of a comedic homage to, rather than a remake of, the original, but I think that was the best way to go with classic material like this. I very much enjoyed this - Johnny Depp has become one of my favorite actors through the years and I always look forward to see what he will do with a role."
3,Something different to watch,"This movie was ok at times funny but overall not to too funny, Johnny Depp really makes the movie as he does with Pirates, if your interested in something different to watch it will fill the bill."
1,Worst Tim Burton Film of all time.,"When I saw the previews for this I thought it was going to amazingly good, as all of Burton's films are. Yes, I expected the film to be quirky and dark, as they usually are...but this movie was so boring I was actually waiting for it to end. I don't care what anyone says; I grew up watching the Burton movies but this was not one I'll ever be watching again. Not to mention that the plot was everywhere! Also, took my little brother to see this, he's twelve, and there was far too much sexuality in this film for children. If you must watch this with your kids, prepare for some awkward moments."
2,Is it really a dark comedy?,"I love JD and Michelle Pfiefer ever since Greae Two but this movie felt like it had multiple personalities. It felt Disneyesc with a bit of amatuerish flare. The comedy wasnt that humorous and the dark not dark enough. Overall they left it open for a sequel which I hope isnt on JD to do list. Skip it...and if I say this, one who gives most movies the benefit of the doubt...dont waste your money."
2,Couldn't hear the dialogue over the music.,I rented it and asked for a refund due to the audio problems. I didn't watch more than the first five minutes when I found I couldn't folow what anyone was saying..
3,Too Campy,"Barely resembled the original series. Acting was OK, but just too campy for me. Previews make it look better than is actually is."
3,It was ok,This movie was ok. Not exactly what I was expecting but it was good to watch once. I doubt if I will watch it again.
3,LIGHT ON DARK SHADOWS,"JOHNNY DEPP IS ENJOYABLE, AS USUAL. A TYPICALLY ODD, QUIRKY AND DELICIOUS PORTRAYAL. BUT THE FILM ISNT AS ODD AND QUIRKY AS MR. DEPP IS. SOMEWHAT BLAND. THE HUMOR IS TAME. IT NEEDED A BIT MORE WHIMSEY...WITH A DASH OF OUTLANDISH THROWN IN."
3,Dark Shadows,"confusing and sort of blah, until the very end. you never know where this is going or where the story line came from or why!"
4,Deliciously Barnabas Collins,"Fun, dark and an excellent performance by Johnny Depp! Fan of both Dark Shadows and Johnny Depp. I enjoyed the movie. Was dark enough to pay homage to the original show, but Johnny Depp brought his own flair to the character, which is almost always a good thing."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I love Johnny Depp, Tim Burton and Chlo Grace Moretz. But this movie was odd and didn't seem well put together. I just think it could have been done better and the plot much improved. I love Johnnys character and the witty humor but I can't overlook the horrible plot in this one. And much as I would like to say I loved this film, I didn't."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for Dark Shadows. Depp, Burton, and Phfeifer in the same movie. It was long and boring."
3,"I laughed - I cried - Aw, heck - it was fun","I never watched the original but my spouse was addicted back in the day. So I watched and laughed my backside off. He was disappointed. He was looking for the plot turns and characters that had been developed in the soap opera.I had no expectations so the whole thing seemed pretty campy to me. I especially loved the bouncing through the walls sex scene. And the little kid was so scary as the only non-crazy member of the family. Then there was that truly scary teenage daughter. We all shake when we encounter that, don't we?"
2,Amusing,"Dark shadows was amusing, but could have been funnier. Good as a rental; glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it."
3,Fun movie.,I have always been partial to the looks and feel of Tim Burton's movies. This movie was fun to watch.
1,Dull,"I fondly remember the Dark Shadows of my childhood. I am a fan of Johnny Depp. I love Tim Burton. But this film was a hopless mess -- and boring! My attention wandered during the second hour and I could hardly wait for it to be over. All in all, a failure."
1,Skip it,Johny Depp is excellent as usual but with a plot that goes nowhere and a weak supporting cast not even a decent performance by the title character can save this movie. If you saw any of the previews you have already seen all of the funny parts of the movie.
1,A travesty,"If you have even a modicum of affection or respect for the original TV series from 1966-71, you will not buy this movie, you will not rent it, you will not watch clips of it. You will run, not walk, in the opposite direction.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp clearly don't understand the meaning of ""homage."" Homage flatters and honors. This movie ridiculed. In the late and wonderful Jonathan Frid's hands, the character of Barnabas Collins was poignant, nuanced, and at times, quite scary. Johnny Depp turned the character into a candy-colored clown.Even if you are a Burton/Depp fan (and I used to be), you'll see this film for what it is: a complete mishmash that has no clue what it wants to be. Subplots are thrown in, characters reduced to a single note, lots of flash but no substance.I was, and still am, a huge fan of the series. When I saw this movie in the theater, I left in tears. If it were possible to give it negative stars, I would do so."
2,Jonny was,Good but the story sucked. Pun inteaded Once of those movie you just had to see if it was true what they said about it
5,Johnny Depp,"This movie is another hit of Johnny Depp. He plays his heart out and will not let you down. When he plays , his sole is in it. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Dark Shadows and of Johnny Depp."
2,If Johnny Depp wasn't in this I wouldn't watch it.,"This was a one-time watch for me, it is not enjoyable and I could barely make it through to the end."
3,Depp,This was a cute movie. We rented it because it was a vampire movie and Johnny Depp was starring in it. We giggled and laughed it was worth the rent.
3,Just OK,"The original Dark Shadows was serialized melodrama in the best sense of the word. Every episode left you with a cliffhanger that had you coming back for more the next day. The performances were uneven, with actors frequently forgetting their lines and searching for the que cards, but therein lay its charm because we got caught up in the quirky world of Barnabas Collins and Co. Unfortunately, the reinterpretation in this movie was confused. The trailers left us with the impression that this was going to be a campy comedy, and there are some cute moments thanks to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas, but it also tried to play out as a drama, and this is where it failed. While I really didn't want to see Dark Shadows played for laughs, I think it would have been better to play up the melodrama and let the comedy come naturally.All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but as far as I'm concerned, its real saving grace was Johnny Depp even if he wasn't at his best."
3,"Mildly funny, mildly dramatic","A ok story, a few laughs but not many. Really wanted to like it, just kind of blaaah. If I had to do it again I'd try something else, this wasn't worth the time spent."
3,Like Depp!,I like J. Depp and rented this to see it. Wasn't a big fan of Dark Shadows so that may have not helped my rating. I did enjoy it and laughed too.
2,Not Depp's best choice to star in,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Johnny Depp! Just not in this movie. His acting is spot on as always however, the story line is to much like that of every other vampire movie out there."
1,Absolutely awful,"We read reviews that slammed the film, but we figured we would give it a chance. We don't mind campy or less-than-perfect films, as long as they have something to offer. The kindest thing I can say about this disaster is that some of the cinematography was nice. Otherwise, it was a trainwreck. Stay away, even if it's free. You'll never get that time back."
2,stupid,"I hated this movie. It was dull and uninspiring I have seen better plots from children's cartoons. Mr Depp was once of of my favorite actors, his ship has sadly sailed......right down the pirate hole. ."
5,Welcome Home Barnabas Collins!,"As a fan of the original TV ""soap"", I thought this movie brought in the myterious aspects of the show and blended well with being in modern times. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are quite a good combination! I especially loved the portion of the movie where they were restoring the manor and Barnabas is trying to find the perfect place to sleep - it was hilarious!!"
2,Really disappointing,"The only reason I reviewed this movie was because Amazon wouldn't stop sending me emails to review it. The story has a lot of holes. PERIOD. Tim Burton did his usually superb cinematography, but it didn't make up for the writing in this movie. It had all the potential to be a great dark comedy, but the movie really had no substance. Only way I would own this movie is if it were less than what I paid to rent it or it was on Netflix."
1,so disappointing,"I can't believe that someone as creative as Tim Burton could have directed this movie! With such a starring cast, it's unbelievable that this movie could be as bad as it was. Not worth the movie to rent or buy, or the time spent watching it."
2,It had it's moments,Is worth a $1.20 Redbox rental. If you are a die hard Depp groupie then $3.99 rental is a good deal.
2,disjointed and disapointed,"I had semi raised expectations for this film based on friends reviews. Maybethey watched a different movie or just smoke too much crack.Tim Burton just needs to retire. Whatever he had before he definitely has lostand it ain't comin back. The premise was a fairly funny one at the beginningbut then Barton stuck it in a blender and it became a disjointed mess.Also. All the lady leads could handle a film on there own, But this was estrogenoverload. Plus the only lady who wasn't fawning over Johnny's gentitals was michellepheiffer. I could have taken this for what is was, if it could've decided what itwanted to be. Instead as Frankenstein's monster, it's better off dead."
4,Not Burton's Best...but Thoroughly Fun and Enjoyable.,"Every once and a while you need a movie like this - quirky, dark, brooding, lavish, silly and unpretentious. I went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. It never set out to change the world - just entertain. Wonderful sets, costumes and make-up are a given with a Burton film, but this one had wit, charm and good writing. There were no huge surprises but I didn't care. It took me somewhere I enjoyed being, and entertained me while I was there with enjoyable characters and a fun tale. I will definitely watch it again."
1,Worst Burton movie ever,I love Johnny Depp and I do like some Tim Burton movies. Had high expectations but was hugely disappointed. Very boring storyline that didn't make sense and wasn't the least bit funny.
2,"So, so BAD","Like a few others, I feel misled by the trailers -- I thought this was going to be a creepy but funny movie, maybe along the thread of Edward Scissorhands. I know nothing of the original TV series, so I have nothing to compare it to and really had no expectations other than that I wanted to enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in some time -- we gave it over an hour and could not stand to watch any more of it. It's spooky, but too dull to make it thrilling, and the humor was nothing but a few poor attempts to get a chuckle from the audience. Depp is usually able to disappear into a role, but here I felt like he was just playing dress-up as a vampire. The Depp-Burton combo failed on this one."
5,Loved It,I was only excited about Depp playing Barnabus because of the attention he would bring to a series I love. Wish they hadn't played it for laughs but I'll take more DS however it's served up.
2,Not the show I remember,I grew up watching the series every day after school and this doe not do it justice. They took a great soap opera and tried to inject so much inuendo that it just isn't good. Save your money and buy the original show.
3,Entertaining and fun,This would be turned out to be better than I expected love the music in it and the characters Johnny Depp is awesome
5,GREAT MOVIE,MY TWO FAVORITE PERSONALITIES AS A KID. BARNABUS COLLINS AND ALICE COOPER. I COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE. MR. DEPP IS STRANGE AS EVER.
3,Need to watch some of the series first,"I thought overall it was pretty good. Depp generally comes through. However, some of the subtleties of the humor required some prior awareness of the soap opera series. It is good without it, but since I had watched some of this soap in the 60's, I think some of the humor was very clever in synching this movie with the series.Worth a look, particularly if you are a Johnny Depp fan."
3,Okay,"judging by the previews I thought that It would be funnier than it was. Kind of disappointed, but other than that It was okay. Nothing outstanding or really bad. Just okay."
1,Stay away..,"Worst Tim Burton movie ever and possibly one of the worst films ever. I'll planned and carried out in everything from story, casting to overall feel. Yuck!!!"
3,Not as good as I had expected,I assumed with Johnny Depp that this would be much better than it was but it was rather bla to me. I did enjoy it but it was a small letdown.
1,Mediocre Laughs.,"Slow movie with few laughs. Was really expecting more since it's a Burton film. Only rent if you need to watch, do not buy."
3,Dark Shadows,"Although I love Johnny Depp, I felt this movie could have had more depth and less comedy. It was a little weak."
3,"Good, but anti-climactic.","Good movie; the cast was fabulous - as you'd imagine - but the story didn't have much to it... lots of funny parts by themselves, but the overall arc wasn't dramatic or interesting enough. VERY predictable, which is fine as long as it's strong and there's enough around it, but in this case, not so much..."
3,Just ok,"I like Johnny Depp and he is great in those types of rolls. As always he plays the part well, the movie on the other hand is well kinda strange and doesn't seem to pull the story well together. I would say watch it if you have nothing better to do or if you are just a big Depp fan. I think it was just ok."
3,Entertaining,It was entertaining but I wouldn't re watch it or buy the blue ray. It was worth the rental though.
3,Lover JD!,Cute movie. Could have been better! I have watched the Dark Shadows series for years and know what was left out..
5,Great Tape,"If you're used to buying Johnson & Johnson First Aid waterproof tape for bandages, try 3M Transpore tape. It's clear, comes in different widths, and is used by doctors and nurses. It's very easy to work with and doesn't make the patient uncomfortable with its removal. Really nice tape."
2,Not too bad for those with a GBA and are new to Lunar,"If you played any of the original Lunar games for the Sega CD or PS1, you will be realy dissapointed in this game. They kept the annoying random encounters and made the dungeons even more tedious. Then, they removed any humor or uniqueness in the dialog. They also removed the good music, animated cutscenes and voice acting but I can understand that because of size limits on the GBA.AS a RPG for the DS, it is fine, maybe even above average but if you are looking to pick this up to relive some Lunar nostalgia, DO NOT DO IT!"
1,"Inferior Quality, Rough cut & Split nails","Unlike their pet shampoos, these clippers are of inferior quality. The blades are not sharp and arrived with nicks on them. Additionally, some dirt/grease was all over the clippers.The cut was rough and it seemed to snap the nails rather than actually cut them. My dog's nails were split after cutting. The only good thing about these clippers is the guard that prevents you from accidentally cutting too much nail on a squirmy dog.Better to spend $2 more and get a Gripsoft or a Bamboo brand. Your dog will thank you."
4,"Good, not complete","This is a very good set of Allen wrenches, the ball end is useful in some situations. My only issue is the skipping of some sizes, such as the #9 and #7 mm. If you want a set with every size in the range, then pay attention to what is missing in the specs for this one."
1,"Bondhus 20199 Balldriver L-Wrench Double Pack, inch and metric","They looks better than their actual uses. I tried to use them to unscrew the hex screws from my pistol grip, and the hex screw didn't even budge at all, but the metals on the L-Wrench were wearing off!!! This is bad, I thought this is strong steel, obviously it was not hard enough. I wish they have tungsten made L-wrench available in the market."
1,Yuck.,The chocolate was great -- but not the pork rinds. (ick.) Try Sugar Free Belgian Milk Chocolate w/o the pork.Sugar Free Belgian Milk Chocolate Almond Bars - 3pc
3,No match for the initial show,"It is fairly entertaining and the actors are pretty... but....All the boys and girls look like they are from the same modeling agency and most of them look much older than 16. Yes, the kids get into trouble and face difficult situations, but everything seems somehow exaggerated and clichéd.The greatest thing about the initial show was that the teens could relate to the characters and their problems. I do not see how someone can relate to the new crowd. Maybe I am just getting old, though.I think that the show's cast would better fit some TV show about models or actor in their mid twenties (not Kansas-born and LA teenagers).Overall, the show is watchable provided that one does expect it to be the same cultural phenomenon as the initial Beverly Hills 90210."
4,Great new show for teenagers,"I am 17 and I started watching this show. I never kept up with it and have been waiting the day when it comes out on dvd. As far as i watched, the show was everything i like in shows. If you're a tough critic with shows i doubt you will like this series, but for teenagers like me, this show is amazing. I recommend this show to any one who liked the OC, One Tree Hill, etc. :)"
4,Crime Does Pay... For a While,"I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of the book, but I found it very entertaining.Every chapter is about a different gang or gangster from the late 1800s through the present. Some were pretty colorful characters for their short lives, since it is not a profession many actually retire from. Quite a few of the gangsters were involved in the numbers, and the author does a good job of showing how the system operated in connection with the Italian Mafia.The last chapter covers the corrupt police who were as bad as most of the criminals.The book is a quick, easy read but does not go into a lot of depth."
3,Pure bliss to read,"A lovely sunday afternoon book which teaches you how to live in the flow, with ease and simplicity. A great follow up from 'Living Magically' by the same author. Easy to read and follow as you tap into your natural wisdom and learn how to fulfil your higher purpose, as well as discover your true nature of joy and creativity. Delightful."
5,Altec Lansing iM11,"Very good buy for the money. Speakers were clear and had decent range.This unit also did a good job of charging my iPOD, which other stationsI bought did not do. Highly recommended."
2,not so good,"I bought this speaker system to bring life back to my 3Gen iPod. We have the AL InMotion IM500 speakers for my wife's Nano and they sound great for such a little system. I expected the same for this system. I'm sorry to say that these speakers have an annoying hiss that can be heard between songs, and if you are listening to music quietly it can be heard over the music. Also, the sound is not as rich as we are led to believe, certainly not like the IM500 for the Nano. Overall the speakers seem kind of cheap. I am disappointed."
1,Fake!!!,"While I've never used this particular product, I've been using pureology loyally for many years. This item is clearly fake. Comparing the bottle to other, salon purchased, pureology products I own, it couldn't be more obvious. The font is off, the trademark marking is in the wrong place, eccetera. I haven't used it, so I can't attest to the quality of this imposter goo"
4,Pretty good,"I have recently read three different books on becoming a Motivational Speaker. This book was a pretty good introduction. I gained a lot of valuable insight from this book and would recommend it, but the best of the three I read was, The Wealthy Speaker, by Jane Atkinson,"
2,"unfortunately not Nightmusic, Vol. 1","I was so impressed with Vol. 1 I had to get Vol. 2 but unfortunately this one does not live up to expectations. Vol. 1 is the has the perfect mix, timing, transitions, everything. Vol. 2 is a very mediocre mix at best, I don't even think its good."
4,An experience for sure.....,"A friend of mine loves this band, and he insisted I watch this DVD. Surprisingly, I liked it very much, even though there were times I was laughing at the sheer silliness of it. If you like thrash metal played very loud, very fast, and love watching a lead ""singer"" who looks like Gollum scream, this is the DVD for you. Most of the time these concert DVD's are not particularly well filmed, but this one is. There is some startling split screen effects and excellent camera work, which is something one doesn't normally associate with stuff like this. The crowd is really appreciative of the band (Strapping Young Lad recorded this in Vancouver, their home base), and their drummer is phenomenal. He's a really big guy, yet he has incredible dexterity for a man of his size. He also mugs a bit for the camera, and it's very funny. This was my first experience with Canadian thrash metal. It may be the last, though I'm not sure. Still, it's an experience."
3,Average,"The product does work as its intended and I have used it during previous workout regimens. However, it doesn't mix as well as it should. As for the taste it is acceptable and is no better or worse than similar products. Bottom line I probably will continue to use until I find a superior product."
3,Nice lamp don't put it next to a radio...,"I am replacing a similar architect halogen lamp that I have had for years (It was longer, better and the price but I can't find it). The new lamp sits on my nightstand and I was going to use it for reading in bed. It was to sit right next to my alarm clock radio (Boston Acoustic). There is the rub; the moment I turned the lamp on the radio turns to an obnoxious loud static. I only have one nightstand so I don't know what I'm going to do. Anyone buying this lamp needs to know this. You most likely can't use it on your nightstand with a radio. Just got it so I may add info more as time goes by. Update: 5/21/10 It broke. The switch has stopped working. I'm very disappointed."

4,Rediscovering His Roots. *** 1/2,"I will never err in classifying this intimate live showcase in the same league as 1971's masterpiece ""Every Picture Tells A Story"". But it might be no accident that he revives half that album when he was at the peak of his credibility.22 years later, that raspy voice retains its magic and he is greatly assisted by a back-to-basics band that revisits his blues and folk roots from back in the day. Yet this product feels a bit trendy as a whole. The two oldies covers of the Impressions and Sam Cooke are banal. Trying to cover Tom Waits is a misstep. And ""Have I Told You Lately"" holds little appeal and confirms my belief that this song will always belong the Van the Man.Still it's nice that he resurrects some old chestnuts. And the three exceptional numbers in this setting, ""Handbags and Gladrags"", ""Reason to Believe"" and ""Highgate Shuffle"" have me wondering if he's ever done any better. These really get down to his early essence."
4,Useful book for the student of the Tarot,"This was one of the most useful books I've read regarding the subject of divination and Tarot. It takes the classical Rider/Waite deck and analyses it from a pictoral, historical, and a qabbalistic point of view. The progression of 'the tree of life' along the major arcana was incredibly useful to me."
3,Not what I expected...,"To be honest, this book was a bit more than what I anticipated... It seems that the writer goes off on a tangent on certain topics which makes you lose focus on what you're reading about...She's a bit too wordy and all over the place for me, however I do like her insight on some of the cards...so this book has been helpful too!"
3,good book but,"not complete in that an accomplished reader will find alot lacking, a moderate reader will find a few gems but not much else and a beginner would be lost not a book on divination more about symbology and qaballah which is what i was looking for"
2,"Beautiful, but not an ""hour"" glass","The product description is deceiving in that it describes it with the following phrase, ""The hour glass function actually works, with sand showing the passage of time."" While it's true that its sand does show the passage of time, it's a mere 10 minutes. For someone who was looking for a true ""hour""glass, it's a big disappointment."
2,Anshu Chatterjee,"Ok, i thot this could be a nice decoration item which it is but thats all.looks: it looks ok. nothing great. i think there are better crystal decoration items out there. or even decarative sand clocks for that matter. so 2 start for looks.Fitting in the home decoration: Well crystal items dont easily blend in the home decoration. so its all upto whoever is buying it.Usefulness: 0. i clocked the time it takes to empty one side. it takes on an average 15 mins to get empty. but anyway this is supposed to be decorative item and not for much use. so 2 stars for that.Suggestion: my take on this will be check out other sand clock and be absolutely sure that this will actually blend with the home decor.."
2,"Well, it's not the Seven Samurai","Oh boy -- it's not just samurai vs. mecha -- it's samurai vs. GIANT mecha. From space (apparently). As you might guess, samurai whupping spaceships and other assorted targets with swords is a little over the top. Bad isn't quite the right word, since the animation's cool -- but the storytelling is often really cheesy, verging into the preposterous (look, a rice farmer might attack an ordinary bandit with a sickle; he probably wouldn't attack one of three 50-foot-tall mecha bandits standing in his field, who kills him with a GIANT SWORD instead of a gun [the robot might, admittedly, ""not want to waste the powder""]). While a series like Avatar: the Last Airbender is pitched at age 13 or so but can reach much higher, Samurai 7 pretty much targets a fairly unsophisticated bracket."
4,Steele writes gritty science fiction,"I love the short stories of Allen Steele and the stories in this collection were where I was first exposed to him. Steele writes hard SF in a voice that reminds me of Tom Clancy, Bob Seger songs, and Heinlein."
5,ROCK CHALK JAYHAWK!,Finally a college basketball for gamecube! I have been waiting so long for a NCAA Basketabll game! Even though they don't have names on the back. Who cares about the names anyway. It is an awesome game but you need to buy a Memory Card 251 because it holds like 241!
3,...straight to mediocrity...,"This is like a coffee table album of the artists herein; joe strummer contrubutes two songs, and neither is very significant or memorable. The pogues' songs are a little better: a remix of ""if i should fall from grace with god"", and covers of ""the good the bad and the ugly"" ""danny boy"" If you've seen the film, the music will have alot more meaning to you. The enjoyment that can be gleaned is mostly in relation to the film. That being said, Zander Schloss' track, ""salsa y ketchup"" is an incredible little number, a latin hot dog advertisement. convince a friend of lesser intelligence than yourself to buy this, then dub the good tracks."
3,Only a mathematical guide,"Inspite of all the hype about this book, its author Jeff Mayo comes across as a ""shopkeeper"" astrologer, interested mainly in earning money quickly, by generating the mass produced impersonal computer-profile type of reports that have trashed astrology. That is evident if one reads this book. This is an excellent introduction to the technical aspects of astrology such as its basic mathematical calculations, but that is all. And that is NOT what astrology is ""all about"". I would advise the novice reader to treat it as such, instead of regarding it as a complete introduction to the subject where one really ""gets the hang"" of it. For that, read what I regard as the modern classic, ""The Astrologer's Handbook"", By Louis Acker and Frances Sakoian, in combination with this book."
2,Not a Good Case,"The cushions are so small, that doesn't fit in each case. So you need to modify the cushions to take a perfect fit."
5,Elegant and Well-Built,"This gem of a watch case is perfectly suited for displayng your luxury watches in style. Its roomy enough to fit even your bulkiest dive-watch. Word of warning. . . if you don't already have ten watches, you will soon feel compelled to fill the case!"
4,A wonderful resource that teaches by example not just theory,"A clever book that dissects the scripts to twenty-five popular or classic films. Unlike other screenwriting books that teach theory in a strictly generic fashion, Pope teaches by EXAMPLE. He systematically breaks down each script showing exactly why it works, or why it doesn't. A valuable aid that I only wish was in print when I was in film school."
4,VERY GOOD SCREENWRITING BOOK.,"TOM POPE, A FINE SCREENWRITER, APPROACHES HIS SUBJECT MATTER IN AN UNIQUE AND THOUGHTFUL WAY. WELL WRITTEN. THOUGHT PROVOKING. HELPFUL TO MY STUDENTS."
1,Horrible Free Towel,These towels were a promotional item. The red bleeds out and will turn a load of laundry water red for several cycles. After one wash your towel will be pink and any lighter colored clothes may be ruined. Just another low quality product with an expensive brand stamped on.

2,Didn't draw me in,"Edward Bear did make a few good points with what he calls ""Deadly Needs"", however I've read better books on how to overcome, cope or improve these flaws/needs. I'm glad Mr. Bear was able to help others. This book just wasn't for me."
4,The One Minute Golfer,"It is an excellent book, well written and easy to read. It is not a manual, but something more: it really helps you to understand the game of golf."
2,Doesn't Fit Hose Thread,"As a check valve it seems to work well. The product description gave me the impression this was made to fit on the end of your rv hookup hose. It is not so. It took a fair number of adapters and by the time I added a pressure regulator, (which is hose thread) I ended up with an 8 inch long frankensteined looking thing. In short it can be made to work but not as sold."
1,Hopelessly enigmatic,"I defy anyone, even an Italian, even an Italian from the same region of beach as this movie was shot, to explain what in the world this movie was about. Golino's performance was quite good, the other actors were good, but the story behind this left me feeling like I'd just wasted 2 hours of my life.Five stars for enigma, one star for watchability."
2,Rust after second use ...,"I was delighted to receive these knives, and even more delighted after using them. But then came the disappointment ... rusting after two uses (already!) on the blades.Package clearly says ""dishwasher safe."" There is no good reason to handwash this knife, given it's materials & price.I would have been better off picking up the 4-piece set of Chicago Cutlery paring knives for under $4 ... at least they won't rust in the dishwasher."
4,Good bargain,"My mother was in need of paring knives and I read the reviews on this set and decided to get them for her. They arrived while I was visiting her for three weeks and I used them daily. They feel good in the hand. The handles are long enough and the blades are thin making them easy to maneuver when coring apples, peeling potatoes or sectioning oranges. The blades arrived sharp and overall they seem to be a good bargain. I will be ordering a set for myself as they are a good compliment for any existing knife set. Just remember that they are 'paring' knives, designed to cut fruit and vegetables in the hand more than to slice or chop on a cutting board."
5,Repackaging and remixing are good things,"Even though Elvis has been gone a long time, these 30 songs (plus one remix) are timeless. No one sounds like Elvis and it's good to hear ""The King"" even after all these years. The last song is interesting since ""A little less conversation"" now sounds like music for a TV commercial."
3,NOT the King Of Rock + Roll,"I hated how this compilation was marketed: ""Before there was gangsta rap, before 'bling-bling', there was Elvis"". What nonsense, but you do what you have to sell the same music over and over again. The truth is, I had resisted purchasing any Presley cds because I never liked their track listings. When this and ""2nd To None"" came out, there was no question that the time had finally come. I don't mind the remixes; there are a couple of mix points which are unwelcome, but overall the sound quality is good. Not every song is a winner, but credit the record company for stuffing each cd to capacity with tracks. Elvis was as much the King Of Rock as Michael Jackson was the King Of Pop - which is to say, hardly at all. In any event, this is a compilation worth getting. You know who's really amazing? EXTREME ELVIS."
3,NOT A ELVIS FAN!,"I'M NOT A ELVIS PRESLEY FAN. I FELT HE WAS REALLY OVER RATED! THERE WERE A LOT OF ARTISTS OUT THERE THAT DIDN'T GET THE RECOGNITION THEY DESERVED. ELVIS GOT TOO MUCH OF IT. THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION FOR ELVIS FANS. HAD THIS COLLECTION BEFORE, AND NEVER LISTENED TO IT. SOLD IT HERE. ORDERED THIS ONE FOR MY NIECE."
5,Nr.1,"An ELVIS'Hits,""The wonder of you"".What a plaesure to hear:""Love me tender!"",""it's now or never"",""can't help falling in love"".Quick,buy it!Dream,dance,so and so..."
3,Rewriting History?,"This is a very decent compilation, but it sounds very dry. The producers have attempted to make this sound like a modern recording with mixed results. If you want the ultimate sounding Elvis collection try to find the 24 Carats gold CD remastered by Steve Hoffman."
5,Excellent,"This CD covers a great variety of styles and music. The songs sound refreshed due to the enhanced technology. It brings Elvis back and shows why he was the Entertainer of the Century. One can feel the pulsating bass line in ""Hound Dog""; the electrying ""Jailhouse Rock""; the touching, crisp and clean stereo sound of ""In The Ghetto""; and incredible ""Suspicious Mind""; the upbeat tempo of ""Burning Love"", and the one of a kind bass voice found in exciting ""Way Down"" provided by Elvis's back-up vocal colleague. This CD has it all. Plenty of music for all taste and emotions. A C.D. worth adding to your collection."
5,Fantastic product!,"Picked mine up yesterday. I am totally pleased with this effort. The remastering job turned out very well. I bet this one will be the greatest seller in Elvis' history.For Rick let me say, no one ever said Elvis invented Rock and Roll. The definition for ""king"" is a man that dominates his area, or field. Now, in the history of recorded music, no one has ever has dominated like Elvis. Sadly the great artist you mentioned never dominated anything. And that is sad because they are all great artist."
2,Whoever remixed this should be shot!,"The music is great, it's what's been done to it I take issue with. All the latest technology has been used to ""improve"" the original tapes. Unfortunately they've been digitized, remixed and doused in noise reduction. So, now it all sounds sanitized, sterile and has been rendered inert and lifeless. ""A Little Less Conversation"" is yet another attempt to ""modernize"" Elvis. The first time was on the early '80's release ""I Was The One"" where some of his greatest rockabilly performances were defaced by modern overdubs to make them sound ""contemporary"". I don't want Elvis transported to the 21st century. When I listen to Elvis I want to be transported to '56-7 or '60 or '69. If you want good sounding Elvis, try to track down DCC's ""24 Karat Hits"". No ""modern"" studio trickery, just good old fashioned tube mojo."
4,Elvis Fan Gift,Great CDMy husband loved it. The perfect gift for Christmas.Would recommend this CD to any Elvis lover.He was surprised with the quality.
5,It's the original recordings!,"OK reviewers. Get with it! Some of you are too young to remember the ""originals"". I was a disc jockey for over 30 years, and I know my music. To say they're ""remakes"", and the quality (echos and fades) sound bad (like in Heartbreak Hotel) is wrong! These are the original recordings, and RCA isn't ripping anyone off or trying to promote poor quality. This is the way Elvis' recordings sounded in the 50's. Remember, ""stereo"" wasn't around then, and the ""echo"" effect was. This album is truly great. The only song I miss is ""My wish came true"", the ""flip side"" of the hit ""A big hunk of love"". from 1959. Elvis ""lives"" on this album. Enjoy."
5,The definitive Elvis CD,"If you are looking for a great Elvis CD, this is it. It has all of his hits and then some, including many of his earlier hit songs. I could listen to this forever."
3,Poison music videos,"This dvd came out after the ""Best Of Ballads and Blues"" (Greatest Hits 2) cd and contains 6 music videos.Shouldv'e included more videos from the tracks on the album and called it Poison: Best Of Ballads and Blues videos, That wouldv'e been cool."
4,Good tool for continental US,I just bought this map of the USA. The last time I looked the United States of America included Alaska and Hawaii. Well in small print on the box this product is only for the 'continental USA'.Besides missing two areas I wanted it is good for mapping out a trip and finding the mileage. I have not tried loading to my GPS or Palm Pilot yet.
1,If your looking for road map type info its ok . Forget the,topographic details they are very misleading in thereadd. They told me to send it back for a refund thenthey sent it back to me saying they could not take itback.STAY AWAY
1,BIG Disappointment,"My daughter received this as a present for her 3rd Birthday. She was so excited about it, until it was put together! Every time she plays with it, it falls apart. This toy is not worth the money. Please don't waste your time or money!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I recently bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. I was very disappointed and I agree with the majority of the reviews online. The castle falls apart, pieces fall of the furniture and the castle design was poorly made. I would have rather seen the company design the castle on the other strawberry type house, at least that house closes and you can store other pieces in it. Don't waste your money...my daughter does occasionally play with it, but not enough to justify the cost."
1,Berry Berry Bad,This is a piece of junk. Pieces fall off all the time. Some of the stuff doesn't even make sense as to why it was included. We paid seven bucks and feel slighty ripped off. I feel bad for anyone who paid full price.
5,Improves on included cable,This cable replaced the one included with the powered subwoofer found in the home-theater-in-a-box we recently purchased and seemed to add even more bass at lower volume settings. Less expensive than the big name brand and probably in no way inferior.
4,Good for the price,The knives are very nice looking and fit well with our flatware pattern and feel nice in your hand. The knives don't cut especially smoothly--tears the meat somewhat but gets the job done. The serrations seem larger and further apart than other steak knives I've used so maybe that's the difference? Overall I'm very pleased with them and may purchase another set for when we have larger parties.
3,"Knives good, box awful",These are high quality knives and it is important they are protected in a good quality box when not in use.The box provided was very poor quality (the lid was severely warped) and since this set was also a gift it was promptly returned. Bad way to cut cost.
5,What a great product,"A complete set of stylish knives that not only will serve their purpose (easily cutting the steak), but also allow you to present an elegant table, worthy of a top restaturant, home or just for your own delight... They get easily marked with the fingerprints and all, but if you take care of them by the book, it will be just great! You won't regret the purchase of this set."
5,Great workout!,I love this workout. This is the first time I've used the balanceball and I like it alot. Tanja is great! She is not annoying - and that is so important. I would like to see her a lot more.
2,220 grit sanding belt,"The sand belt itself isn't so bad, however the glued seam is too thick and causes the wood to bounce. There is definitely a better way to put two ends together. Therefore I don't like it, but it is usable."
3,Bad title to a fun movie,"No, this movie has nothing to do with snakes. It does have James Caan as a just released from prison car thief getting involved with a hunt for money and running across an assorted variety of crazy characters in California. Richard B. Shull singing ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" really stuck in my mind. And dig that house explosion early in the film. Not a bad movie. Not a great movie. Something to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon."
2,Falling apart after 3 months,"I bought this set to match our everyday dishes from Sabatier. They looked great when they arrived and I have used them everyday till recently when one of knives handle broke while I was cutting a cucumber! Also two of the forks have rust marks on them now. I have been washing them in dishwasher so that could be why they rusted, but the box didn't say anything about handwashing them. Also I have contacted Sabatier and they told me that they will send me a replacement knife as soon as I send the broken one back!"
3,Pup Named Scooby Doo is OK,"My son is a huge fan of Scooby Doo, so when we found these Pup series, we bought them. While they are cute and innocent and have the fun of exaggerated animation (hair going in all directions when scared, Scooby turning into a rocket when given a Scooby Snack), they aren't in the typical Scooby fashion of the older Scooby Doo series. They are imaginative and adventurous but if you are a Scooby Doo fan of the older series or of the ""What's New Scooby Doo"" series, then this is off the path."
4,Great game.,"This game is as good or better than Sega's NBA games. The only disappointment is the fact that all the players are generic - in other words not even the top 25 or 50 teams have their real rosters from last season. I don't expect them to have included every single D-1 NCAA basketball player in this game, but perhaps the rosters fromt the teams that made the tourney last year should be included. I wonder if it's a licensing issue with the NCAA?"
1,Highly disappointing.,"I was really hoping to enjoy this game, but I was very disappointed to find that it's one of the worst games I've ever played on the XBox. The graphics are poor, the announcers are horrible, and the game play is terrible. By my 3rd game I was stealing the ball 80+ times w/ the game set to the hardest level (not because I'm particularly good or anything). The only thing that is half-way decent is the recruiting mode, but recruiting and simulating a season is only fun for so long."
4,Position-sensitive performance,"I've watched these tubes for 20 yrs, they've progressed quite a bit. For a budget-minded system they absolutely deliver. A couple notes -Manufacturer recommends 6"" from a corner, aimed at the corner. I got poor results from that, sort of a one-note-wonder thump machine. Much better when aimed across the rear towards the rear quarter panel, the sound comes alive & is much more fluid, less thump-y. Aiming forward gets very little output.Currently using in a 14 passenger van (HUGE!) with about 300w total to sub, it's plenty of power to offset 75w x 4 mains. Considered trying the 12"" DVC model but I don't think I need any more output than the 10"" in this setup."
2,Sharp but rusting issues,"I purchased a set of these knives hearing good things about the brand but i was quickly disappointed as well. The sharpness was very good but after a few washings, the knives developed small rust spots! Needless to say they were returned. We even contacted the company but they were not very helpful in their response."
3,"Quality cutting board, but slippery to cut on....","I got the quality I expected, this board is very thick and solid. But it seems very slippery with meat juices, veggies etc. I was worried about accidentially cutting myself. Also, it was slightly dinged up when I got it, not sure if it had proper packaging. After washing it by hand gently, I saw faint white spots on the wood. From now on I may just use it to cut veggies on, no meat. Great quality, but not sure if it has enough friction on it, seems too smooth and slippery. B-. Great price for the brand name, though!"
1,Not typical Henkels quality,"The first time I used the board I was impressed, seemed like solid construction, the rubber feet were a nice touch. Unfortunately, this was the only time I got to use it as less than a week later it developed 2 major cracks, making the board nearly useless. Did not soak or otherwise mistreat the board. Am very disappointed in Henkels, usually better quality than this. Save your $$."
3,Henckels,"The only major problem with the cutting board is the lack of a channel to catch juice when slicing various meats..etc.The board is great for cutting drier foods. ie. CheeseHenckels produces two main lines of products the trademarked single twin and the also trademarked double twin. The products made in the United States especially the cutlery is the lower quality line. These are marked with the single twin. The line made either in Soligen, Germary or another European Country is the higher quality (professional chef quality)line. This line is marked with the double twin. So when buying Henckels products look for the double twin."
3,Very very small,"This is too small, unless you're cutting a single clove of garlic. When slicing an onion, half of it will fall off the edges and onto the counter or floor, leaving a big mess. Unless you're cutting a single item at a time, and have no counterspace, find something a bit larger."
1,Not a good one,I completely agree with the other reviewers. This antenna is not at all effective. Tried it all over the room etc but never got half the stations the plain old rabbit ears brought in. Returned it to the store.
1,Review other products first! SAVE your money...,"We purchased multiple copies of goldmine to share databases, EVERY step of using goldmine is overly complicated and fraught with data loss.This is a VERY feature-rich product, but apparently only lifelong goldmine users and the developers know how to use this product.Simple things like merging data, importing records, resolving duplicate records each turn into nightmares.Support from Front Range Solutions is non-existant -- that is unless you pay (a deal at 35$/call) EVEN INSTALLATION required a support call. Add at least 10 calls to your budget for this product.I have managed numerous complex software developments and have rarely seen software this obtuse."
1,Zero stars for Goldmine,"I have used Goldmine for a year (as I was required by my company) and I finally got the word that I can go back to Outlook. What a drama it has been. Even the most obvious feature of being able to make a back-up is a disaster.Customer service was also a drama.Really relieved to go back, THANK YOU MICROSOFT for given me Outlook"
2,Uninspired,"This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all.."
1,"Not impressed, yet.","I suspect this is related more to the seller than the product, but this machine failed right out of the box. The motor didn't even turn over once before it blew a fuse. All it did was hum for a second or two and shut off. When I took it out of the box, it already smelled like a burned up electric motor. I think the seller (The Raw Food World, Inc.) sent a previously returned unit, because this thing was definitely NOT new. I was already a little concerned over the seller's choice of a carrier that couldn't find my address and had to deliver a day late after I paid for overnight shipping. This is very disappointing given all the wonderful reviews and videos on how much can be done with this machine. I'm returning this one and ordering another one from someone else."
2,Too much time to use!,"I recieved the juicer as pomised. However, I did return it. I work and time is so valuable to me, the juicer was just too time comsuming for me. I purchased another type."
1,"Original Snaps Classic Chewy Candy,4.5 ounice boxes of 12","Being a Snaps lover from my childhood days I was so thrilled to find these on Amazon and so very, very disappointed. I can't blame the seller for the manufacturers deceit but these Snaps advertised as SOFT AND CHEWY!!! were hard as ROCKS!!! Even our children with stronger teeth would only lick off the candy coating and then throw out the licorice. The pink ones had a bitter aftertaste. I finally threw them out and will never order again."
2,Great size but cracked easily,Love the size and look of dish. It cracked after a few uses.Only used in the oven and dishwasher - no freezer or microwave.I have all the pieces to this set and am afraid I will be wasting money if I replace.
5,"Imaginative, funny, and touching.","What starts out as a smart and comic novel quickly becomes something that will touch any gay man to his very core. Mr. Merlis takes us on a ride that encompasses Greek mythology, love and deceit, and the lost boy in all of us. What I found most profound about this book was the last fifty pages. Not wanting to give away the end, I'll just say that the pay off is incredible."
4,"too good, too inventive, to be casually dismissed","Nothing in gay fiction I'd read previous to this prepared me for what I found here. The writing is hard and sharp like a diamond, and the Homeric setting (which at first thought- before I'd read a word of the book - irritated me), contrary to the cutesy-pooishness of the idea, actually works, is MADE to work, immensely well. The single and only complaint I have with the book revolves around the Homeric character of Patrocolus, Achilles' doe-eyes boy-toy. Merlis' book relies so heavily on Achilles being uber-heterosexual that he's forced to ignore that whole strand of his inspiration. But that's a mere picked nit! Read this book!"
1,Waste of effort,"I recently ordered these belts, and they arrived in good condition and quickly. However, they are totally unusable. The seam where the belt joins is wildly different in thicknesses causing the material I'm trying to sand to bounce such that it is completely unusable. I even tried the second belt to see if the first was just flawed, but if it is, then they are both flawed the same way. I've purchased a different brand now and am much happier!"
3,A Good Introduction,"Napoles text provides a good overview of the branding topic by mixing visual examples with instructional text which in turn support the text to create a step by step approach. I would thoroughly recommend the book for those seeking information on small scale projects. What is lacking is a strong strategic section dealing with large scale corporate issues. Studio designers working on small scale projects will benefit, but anyone looking for instruction on large scale consultancy type brand creation might be a bit disappointed."
5,One the few good reads on Solar Arc's I have found,If you are looking to learn Solar Arcs...this is the book. Christine did a wonderous job in the layout and writing of this masterpiece. With everything from progressions to transits and secondaries and so on and so forth. I can't praise this one enough.Now I would like to comment I don't like predictive astrology and I don't use the methods she teaches for that purpose. I say this because I think the title might scare some people off.
1,Sent back,"After a few uses, the spring went bad and the blades wouldn't close. I used wd40 and surgical milk but couldn't restore them."
1,Pass on these.,"Shears are a simple tool. All they have to do is open and close. And yet, thanks to the spring mechanism, these particular shears are problematic. First and foremost, the spring will rust and seize up, which leads to stiffness in the mechanism. Next, the locking mechanism will either be too hard to engage (and sometimes unlock), or too easy (locking while cutting). Finally, the plastic nubs that secure the metal spring are weak and will break. These shears lasted a year or two for me being used several times per week. I guess that's not too bad... except my mother has kitchen shears that she bought 15 years ago, and they're just as good as the day they were purchased. These degraded over time and became a frustration to work with. Avoid these like the plague. There are many better options here on Amazon, and most of them are cheaper as well."
3,Not As Good As I Had Hoped,"After reading an excerpt from the author's book on a website, I had great expectations for the book...I was rather disappointed.The author spends most of his time refuting other theories on this Goddess while not really presenting any ideas of his own. It made for a frustrating read, and I came away wishing he'd given a bit more that was ""concrete.""I still recommend it, but also suggest refering to other authors (many of whom are listed in his bibliography) for more primary source material. END"
3,Defective inside sleeves,"Case outside is great, even perfect. The inside first set of pages was upside down to the rest. Kind of annoying; not a big deal."
2,Not actual transcriptions of non-guitar parts,"Contrary to what the other reviews imply, there are ONLY guitar transcriptions in this book. They actually convert the keyboard parts to guitar as well! Horrible. What I thought this was, with the old cover art, and with the customer reviews, was one of the ""complete transcripts"" that has the music for each part in the right instrument. This is NOT that. If you are a keyboard player, look elsewhere."
1,Isn't worth a plug nickel.,This is another piece of Chinese junk that is invading our markets. It did not work when it arrived because the plug did not extend far enough to contact the center of the 12 volt power receptacle. I attempted to repair it as I needed it for a trip I was taking the next day. The tip did not unscrew as it was supposed to and I had to purchase another plug. It still did not work after a new plug was added. This was a complete waste of time and money and I wouldn't bother purchasing this item.
4,can we make meaning?,"Kate Wheeler's character Maggie is determined to make meaning in a world where there are those who suffer and those who are indifferent to suffering. She sees a world of great failures and small successes, in which the distances between daughter, mother and grandmother, between rich and poor, between sick and healthy, between the hunter and the hunted appear nearly unbridgeable. Nearly, but not quite.This is a first novel and suffers from many of the usual faults of first novels. There's a certain amount of wandering in the plot. But Wheeler's characters are complex, fully human and definitely not the kind you'd expect in a made-for-TV movie. Her ability to set a scene is, well, gorgeous. She interlaces stories and relationships deftly.And Maggie, poor Maggie? Does she make meaning? I think so, but you'll have to decide for yourself. I look forward to Wheeler's next novel."
2,Not my favorite,"I bought this early on in to help the pain in my belly when I laid on my side, it was ok for awhile but finally gave it up for my own feather pillows which were much easier for me to position how I wanted them. The problem with this pillow is that its too firm and when my belly was really sore it just put more pressure on it. That didn't feel good, and made it difficult to sleep. I usually ended up tossing it on the floor halfway through the night. I recently tried to use it for awhile and it doesn't work at all for me in the last trimester either. If your belly is stretching and sensitive to pressure don't get this, just invest in a couple of good feather pillows! :)"
4,helped me sleep!,"I have had such a hard time getting comfy at night. This has been very helpful. I don't use it all night, every night. But it is a nice option in the sea of pillows I surround myself with right now (8th month). I started using it around week 28 when my belly needed the support."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"There is nothing WRONG with this cheap, little pillow... except it's so flimsy that it ends up wedging under my husband or lost somewhere under the blankets. I'm glad so many people had success with it. I just felt it was too small to do anything worthwhile. I've had it since early in my pregnancy and tried it at many different stages and truly everywhere I could think to try it around my body. Now I'm in the last 3 weeks and I need something under my belly and this this still doesn't cut it."
3,"Helpful, but not wonderful","This helps take some of the weight off my hips, but I flip in the middle of the night and this always ends up on the floor. Great for lounging, but not great for sleeping."
4,Gotta have it,"I love this pillow. I got a prenatal massage and they used one when putting me on my side. I couldnt believe the support it gave me and I ran out to buy one immediately. It completely took the strain off my back and the ligaments weren't being so stretched with the support of this cushion. My only complaint... I knock it off the bed when I sleep, but that's my problem."
3,small,this pillow is ok. it gives some support but it is really small and pretty thin. Before buying I recommend looking carefully at the dimensions (it's basically the size of a small throw pillow)
4,Background to the King James Bible,"This account of the preparation of the King James Bible provides useful historical background. However, it is a bit disappointing in that it devotes more attention to the politics and personal lives of the translators than to issues of meaning and theology."
2,Overrated,"After reading several great reviews, I approached this book with keen interest, only to find myself bored, and struggling to finish the last forty pages. My time could have been saved if the author had simply said he thinks the KJV is better than all modern translations and have done with it, nevermind that in the 21st century the KJV is hard going, its musicality lost in the ancientness of its language. Even Mr. Nicholson's work is hard going with his insistence of reproducing all quotes in their original 17th century spelling. I found the book little more than a series of personality profiles with precious little actually devoted to the KJV and how its translation came about--something I was far more interested in than whether or not one of the Translators married for money. Sorry, but for me this Emperor wears no clothes."
2,"Mediocre treatment, a dry read","I picked this book up when I read a positive review in a local newspaper. It sounded like a book that would be very interesting. However, I was wrong. Nicolson's style tends to drag, and when he decided to include major quotes in the exact language from the 17th century--well, I, for one could not understand what most of the quotes were saying without studying each one. Two-thirds of the way through the book, I gave up and didn't finish it, which is very unlike me. Rarely do I quit a book when I have made such an investment of time and money.Now that I've had my appetite whetted on this subject of translating the KJV, I might need to look for other treatments, as I've heard there are some better overviews. So I'm sorry, but I just have to say that I was disappointed in God's Secretaries and am therefore not able to recommend it."
3,Not bad but not as good as Alister McGrath,"This is a fascinating subject and Adam Nicholson is a good writer and easy to read, on this gripping tale. So five stars for the book - except that the book by Alister McGrath that came out in 2002 on the subject is even better, because Alister, unlike this author, really understands and can fully empathise with the theology of the KJV translators. So 3 stars rather than 5 - but this is a good book. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
4,Good read,"The author gives us an intimate glimpse of the process that created the King James Version of the Bible. Produced by a committee of 54 learned men, the book remains one of the great masterpieces of the Enlglish language. Nichols takes us behind the scenes to show us the religious and political factions that ruled during that era and who managed to put aside their differences to give this and succeeding generations a translation of the Bible that still has tremendous influence."
4,A Winning Introduction,"Read other reviews for a detailed description of the book. Having been raised on the King James Bible, I knew basically nothing of the story behind it. This story has been marvelously brought to life by the author. It certainly must not be any type of academic reference, and I'm grateful for that. This book appears to written for those, like me, not schooled in theology or history from this period. I found it as entertaining as any novel, and could possibly motivate readers to delve further into the period. Highly recommended!"
4,Indoor tent,"This tent was purchased for my grandson at Christmas. It went up really easy. It just kind of pops open. My 7-year old grandson slept in the tent at night with his legs sticking out, it's not that big. But when it came time to take it down so he could take it on the plane with him - not so easy. Four adults couldn't figure out how to return it to the compact position it came in. We did the best we could but it had to travel as a carry-on because it wouldn't fit in any luggage. In all fairness we were rushed, so we didn't sit down and really try to figure it out. I can't comment on durability because I haven't seen it since then. My grandson had fun with it, but it's not a big tent. Someone who said they fit 3 people (2 adults & 1 child) in it - I don't know how they could possibly have done. I would say that's impossible."
2,"A promising start, but not much substance to this novel","I was disappointed there was not more substance to this novel. Fitzgerald was less than halfway finished when he died, and the seventeen ""completed"" episodes were in obvious need of re-editing. Judging from the author's notes, they would have been revised extensively anyway to fit his shifting vision of how the plot would evolve. There are moments of clever satire on the Hollywood Industry (and especially its writers) that would probably have made the finished product well worth reading, but Fitzgerald was still struggling to balance the satirical tone of his novel with the love story of its protagonists. The editor's notes were very helpful, though, inasmuch as they showed what direction Fitzgerald wanted to take and the alternate endings he had in mind."
4,"A Fun, Lighthearted Dragon Ball film","This is a nicer, more laid-back DB film. It's about young Goku, not the powerful Saiyan, his descendant. 100 years after the end of Dragon Ball Z, young Goku's grandmother Pan has suffered a stroke and is in the hospital. He sets out on a journey to Mt. Pao, his great great grandfather's home to find the Dragon Ball, which has the power to heal his grandmother. A nice movie full of comedy and emotion. Not a hardcore fighting movie, but it does have a camillo with a beloved Dragon Ball character."
5,Finally in America!,"I've seen the Japanese version of this film, and couldn't wait for it to be dubbed into english.100 years after Goku leaves Earth, his Great Great...well, you get it, Grandson, Goku Jr., has to set out on a quest to find the 4-star dragonball, which he believes will help his sick Grandma.Even though Goku Jr. is a complete coward, you have to fall in love with him. He's absolutely adorable, even when there are tears and snot running down his face, and pee running down his leg. He finds out at the end that he does have courage when he needs it, and proves that the power of the Super Saijin will never die."
3,Actual vs Expectations,"I think a lot of Dragon ball lovers have waited for this installment. But when you got to see it, a lot would be dissapointed. It's different from wha tyou would expect from DBZ or DBGT story.The story tells the life of Goku Jr. Probably in between the end of shenron series and before the Tenkaichi Budokai with Vegeta Jr. The whole story showed that all the DBZ fighter's dead, pan so old (didnt show Goku Jr parents), Goku Jr. been a coward, search the dragon ball, goku show up and tell him that he need 7 of the DB, and then ending.You would expect some action, but really, not much. Also, instead of a few series which the DBGT offer. This DVD only have one series, I rather get the 13 movie and 2 TV special, which were made by the Toriyama team.It's nice to see a comeback, but a ratehr weak one. Goku must be sad to see the response."
3,raw and furious...,"Krieg's latest offering on CD is his most straight forward one.. If you don't know or have never heard Krieg's musik, this is raw/chaotic (noisy) BM in the vein of the ancient gods like : profanatica, beherit, blasphemy.. so you know this is gonna be really noisy BM. The vocals are weak in comparison to his previous albums, but still have somewhat ofa nasty feel to 'em. Well, this mCD isn't bad at all, it's just that he's done a lot better.. I must also say that the production on the 1st 4 songs are totally flat sounding, and take away a lot of power from the instruments (what was akhenaten thinking?) , but on the last track, everything sounds better (the guy in bloodstorm drums on this song). If you're into chaotic/noisy BM, don't pass this one up... Hails!"
3,Gorgeously Shot Mess,"No character development, exteriors or minor characters(!), beautiful photography in rich color, some truly revolting/cruel stuff that isn't scary, an interesting plot turn half-way in, shot at Mosfilm studios in Russia for a change, Elisha is fine but another excellent actor is wasted, little effective suspense. The ending is actually very cool. Not good enough, as the entirety doesn't really gel. Not a bad try."
1,"Non-thrilling ""Thriller""","I was very dissapointed. From the onset, the movie was unbelievable and the audience was provided no real reason to like or care about any of the characters. There are much better thriller/horror movies than this. I fast-forwarded through most of the latter half of the movie, and in the end, I wished I hadn't wasted my time..."
1,Captive to this movie for 85 minutes,"I'm not a big fan of torture cinema, especially if the audience are the ones being tortured. This movie was so terrible I had to fight to sit all the way through it. Ms Cuthbert is easy on the eyes, but her character was so shallow she was hard to identify with. And there wasn't really a whole lot done to her. When the male captive is first brought in its easy to see where things are going, and the big reveal is a letdown. A better movie, with better acting, is BROKEN."
1,There is a reason to see what you are buying,"These knives look much better in pictures than when you open the package and see them. Very flimsy and light, they are sharp, and useable, however, I would not have purchased them if I had seen them at K-Mart or some other discount store, where I would expect to find them."
5,We bought this set 20 years ago and still love and use them,"We bought this set over 20 years ago to replace a low quality set given to us as a wedding present that didn't hold up. All these knives have kept their edges and not developed nicks or scratches in the steel from daily use dispite the abuse from 2 children and a rough husband! They all look and work almost as well as they did when purchased! I don't know if Henkels has changed their manufacturing process for these knives over the years, so I can't speak to the negative reviews listed. However, if I had to go out and buy another good quality, all purpose kitchen knife set today, this would be the first set that I would consider purchasing!"
3,henckels int everedge knife set,of course i am familiar with henckels knives and i knew this set was made in china. i did not expect it to be german made henckels quality and i suppose it is worth 40 bucks but not much more. it is a attractive set but the knives are very lightweight. would i buy it again?? prob nottom
1,Poor Quality,"I order this knife set for our Bahama home knowing that with this low price, they could not be a good as the J.A. Henckes I have at my home in the States. But, I thought, J.A. Henckels would not put their name on junk. They arrived at a friends house and he brought them to me in the Bahamas.Was, I disappointed. They feel cheap and the kind of Knife that you would buy at Dollar General Store. They cut and perform the same way.I just ordered a (one)Chef Knife and when it arrives, I going to give this set away. I would rather have one good knife that a set of junk."
1,returned to sender,These knives were very light weight and had cheap looking plastic handles. I returned them the day after they arrived.
2,Low Quality,"Very thin blades, the handles are not rivetted, the blade wobbles if I try to cut something hard."
5,Best knives in 44 years of marriage!,"I bought these knives about 4 years ago and even though they are used and in the dish washer daily, they look and work as good as when I bought them. I have never sharpened them either and they have not dulled in the dishwasher. One of the best purchases I have ever made in 44 years~"
1,henckel? I dont think so,"I dont know about you, but I buy Henckel knives so they wont be cheap japanese Ginsu imitations. I am going to contact Henckel to find out If they know Eversharp is uning their name in vain. Save yourself some money, you can get better knives for free from burger king."
1,Henckels International Everedge 13-Piece Knife Set,"Don't let the brand name fool you. This is a really cheap set of knives and I am shocked that Henckels would even put their name on it. The blades are thin and the handles are poor as well. Seems like the kind of knives you'd buy in a pinch at the supermarket. It may seem like a great deal, but it really isn't when you have to trash it and buy a better set."
3,They are SO SO,These knives are so so. They are not good when it comes to dicing vegetables. Some of the knives are just not sharp thinking about returning them for another knife set.
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"These knives are nice in that they look good and are sharp, but they can't handle cutting through tough items like watermelon or sweet potatoes."
2,Semi-serrated weird knives,"I got these knives as a gift... and the block is nice, sure, but these things are cheap. Instead of a good solid edge, they all have this strange semi-serrated edge... sure, it cuts, but it's cheap and catches on your food if you're making fine slices. And the plastic handles and weighting and... I suppose I could go on, but knives generally are what you pay for, and the price on these are cheap."
1,"A high-end cutlery SHOULD BE quality, fashion, and always high-end","Henckels ... where did you go wrong?!Once a fan - I'm afraid you've become a bit too ""Wal-Mart"" in both fashion, quality, and loyalty to your former cutlery consumers...As of late, I have found MUNDIAL (http://www.mundialusa.com/gourmet.html) to be the up-and-coming Upper East Side quality with an Upper West Side style! At least, everyone in Manhattan is raving about it! InStyle Home magazine even featured it to my surprise!"
4,Excellent Watch!!,Very interesting to see The Residents Commercial Album videos in its entirety. Though they're not all done by The Residents.
1,Product shown doesn't match product number,"The product shown is not the D9013; it is the D9525. I ordered the blue-and-white D9525 product as shown, which includes a two-minute timer (as a reviewer on the Web page pointed out), but Unbeatable Sales sent me a D9013, which is pink and white and does not include a timer. I assumed that the product I'd received was an equivalent (it is also called a ""Plak Control"" toothbrush) until I opened the package and used it. The 9013 is not an equivalent to the one shown on the Amazon site (and which I've owned before) because it doesn't include a timer. The photo accompanying this product description should be changed to reflect the real toothbrush received, and the current customer review noting the timer should be edited to delete that information. Now I can't get the vendor to allow me to return the product, even though it was the wrong product sent."
2,Too much to be believed,"I hate to rain on the parade of stars for this book, but I honestly thought it was totally unbelievable. I had read Sullivan's Island which was funny and convincing most of the time, so I was looking forward to reading this book next. I have to say that except for in a few chapters, the story is just too ridiculous. It has too many underdeveloped characters and plot ideas. Anna, the narrator, takes ONE walk on the beach and meets the perfect man. She buys a new house and starts her own business and has parties and on and on without the least problem. It is such a fantasy, it's hard to feel convinced. The author has talent, but she needs to slow down and think through her plot a little better. I'm getting tired of so many sterotypes in southern fiction. This had potential- it was just overdone."
4,Liked but not loved..,"I truly enjoyed Sullivan's Island...so i was hoping this book would be just as good. Not true...the first part was a bit dull but once Emily, David, Bettina and Brigitte came aboard, all was well. I finished it with a positive feeling and will continue to read DBF in the future."
1,Disappointing,This book was recommended by a friend as being a light hearted fun book. Uhhh...NOT. I was so glad when the story was finally done - only reason I got to the end is because I actually purchased the darn book - didn't want my hard earned money to go to waste so I made myself finish it. After the last word in the last chapter I noticed there was an epilogue...couldn't bear it and didn't read it. Basically I didn't really care about the characters so I didn't give a toss what happened to them.
1,poor directions,i purchased this item and i have been trying to figure out for weeks how to build it. the instructions are horrible.i would not recommend this product.
4,Typically gorgeous Rutter,"I love John Rutter's music. Especially the ""For the Beauty of the Earth"" that is on this CD. Rutter is not the most inventive or varied composer of modern music, but if you have a taste for traditional choral writing with some angelic children's chorus singing, then you will probably share my enjoyment of Rutter's writing. Unfortunately I cannot give this CD 5 stars when it seems there is a drum set tapping annoyingly away on several of the songs. I do not understand this at all and am bothered by it every time I listen to those songs. It's a shame, because otherwise I love the music, and think it is lushly written, and simply but beautifully performed. I would highly suggest listening to sample track 3 before purchasing -- you can hear what sounds like a ride-cymbal right at the very end of the sample. This sound occurs in several of the songs on this recording."
4,interesting tale,"Being a pre-service teacher myself, I was intrigued by the story when I glanced at the back of the book. Then one rainy afternoon I sat down to read the book. I was very pleased. The storyline was not terribly predictable and the main character is endearing. Good read, I recommend it to people looking for a light tale with a happy ending."
1,Xandros os 3.0,"I thought I would try this os, however, for myself I was disappointed it did not initialize at all. It was not what I thought of this os on this disc. I am sure others had no probs., but for myself it was not worth it."
3,"Good Knive, however handles out of the box look worn!!","The knives are very good, however every handle on the 5 Stars looks worn (almost scratched). I thought it may have been shipping damage since the knives do move around in the box. However, I took a trip to the many stores to see in what they look like at retail stores. Every store (including Williams and Sonoma) had very worn looking handles. I check display and from brand new boxes. There is something wrong with either the composite they are using or the process. BEFORE you order any 5 star knives check them out in person to avoid frustration with the handles. Henckels is a great company and these are great knives, but be forewarned the handles on all of the knive look dirty (especially the [end] of the handle)."
4,My sucky review,"An entertaining film that is a good mix of comedy and horror. Low budget but is easily better than a lot of much larger budget films - good actors, cinematography, and direction."
5,Great!,"This is a great read. The unearthliness of Feehan and fast moving and romantic as Lindsey and My newest favorite ""Anything, My Love"" by Cynthia Simmons. A sizzling page turner. That's what I like, book I simply can't put down."
3,"It's Only an ""OK"" Book","I read the book, entered my due date in the back and worked my way forward(which was a pain!). It was very boring, but a good reference if you want to read a little bit everyday before bed to find out what will happen with your baby tomorrow. They do not leave enough space for you to write in the Notes sections. There are no interesting drawings to look at to make your pregnancy experience seem more real. It was 'ok', but not the best pregnancy book I have read. I suggest previewing the book BEFORE you buy it."
1,nonsensical ...,"Someone gave me this book, and I found it absolutely maddening. It uses two different systems for counting down to the due date - one based on 280 days from the end of the last period, and one based on 266 days from the date of conception. The author always fails to distinguish which system she is using, and the numbers in the journal relate to one system, whilst the numbers on the wheel (provided to ""help"" you follow your pregnancy) are based on the other. The authors logic is so crooked that it is almost impossible to match up the dates between the journal and the wheel. I would rate this book as not just bad, but potentially dangerous - it could confuse a woman into getting her due dates mixed up and thinking she was overdue when she wasn't. Don't buy - and if given this book, be careful!"
5,Every mom needs this book,"A lot of books on pregnancy out there but this one really spoke to me. Each page provides a concise account on what's happening in the mother's body with her baby. So many expectant mothers I have gifted this too have thanked me over and over. I even found it fascinating from a male perspective. So, great gift for moms AND dads!"
2,Not as useful as I thought it would be,"There is not anything really wrong with this item, but I did not find time to write in it, or to read it so it was not as great idea to buy it as I thought. The organized pregnancy books were much more useful. Also, some pages have very little space for notes."
1,Not really a journal...,"I bought this book before I knew that there were other journals out there, I looked at the first few pages which had questions about my pregnancy... which I liked I want to document my pregnancy the best I can. Before I started writing in it however, I didn't look through the rest of the book. There is more information in it day to day than there is space to write about your own pregnancy. I was at Barnes and Noble yesterday and I saw ""The Belly Book"" and I WISH I would've gotten that one, and I probably still will since this ""journal"" isn't really a journal. If you want the information and a journal I would just get ""What to expect when you're expecting"" and ""The Belly Book"". Then you get the best of both worlds. Hopefully that is helpful to some of you other preggo ladies out there, I just totally wouldn't recommend it unless you look through the book first and decide that's what you want."
5,Pregnancy Journal,"I love this book! I feel closer to my unborn baby. I had the exact same book for my daughter and had to find it again for this pregnancy. Love it, Love it, Love it!"
4,good book,"So much better than the What to Expect book! Great book, very informative.The only things I wish for are: more journaling space.And the dates are confusing. It gives two different dates on each page for the pregnancy and those dates do not coorespond with what midwife says. For example, I have 100 days left of my pregnancy, but according to the book, I have 112. I don't like how the dates are set up.But it's still very informative and easy to read."
3,i like it,"I like it, the book does not really work well for a couple expecting a baby via a surrogate. we bought it thinking that we would follow along so we could feel more involved? This book would be great for a expectant mom... but for a same sex couple, half of the information is irrelevant!"
3,It is usefull for the first 20 weeks,"I bought this book in Mexico and I paid $40.00 dollars for the spanish version. I really think its worthless. 15 dollars is a good price. It emphasizes on the anatomy and development of the baby, this is good and very interesting, but after the 20 week, prenatal psichology is an important issue: how to communicate with your baby, and the author says it is useless to talk with him/her or play music on your belly, notwithstanding, researches have proved the opposite. One thing i liked are the little parts that talk about traditions of other cultures, it reminds me a great book of ""The Body Shop"" named ""Mama Toto"". The phrases on the bottom of every page give you every day a smile."
5,Favorite Pregnancy Book,"If you are looking for a blank journal - this isn't the book for you. If you are looking for a way to daily connect with the child growing within your womb - this is the perfect book for you. It was a psychological lifesaver for me. When my back was aching and nausea overwhelmed me I would often go to this book and read and it always reminded me that all the tough times of pregnancy are well worth it! I love the in depth detail on the estimated events that are happening. I realize that we all progress differently so the timing may not be perfect. However, as a nurse I am impressed with the accuracy of the material.I have two sons and purchased a book during each pregnancy. I love reading through my notes in the books and recalling the sweet (and not so sweet) memories of pregnancy. We are planning on trying for another baby soon and this is the top book on my list! It will be a very special part of each of our children's memory chest."
2,Would be good if worked right,Like others said it fell apart shortly after getting it in the cigarette lighter. But I kept using it and then eventually it stopped working altogether.
1,Audio interference,"I bought one and tried it in my Lexus - there was a LOT of audio interference that sounded horrible. It worked in the sense it charged the iPod and played music through the car, but the amount of noise introduced by this device sent it right back to the product returns counter."
4,Still works after more than 6 years,I bought this hair dryer back in 2004 or 2005 and it is still in excellent condition. It might not get as hot as professional dryers but it gets the job done. I gave it four stars because the main nozzle comes off while I'm drying my hair which is a pain in the butt. Otherwise this a great product that is definitely worth the price.
1,This saw blade does not hold up.,"As a point of reference, I have used several 7-1/4"" aluminum cutting blades before in building my 49' aluminum sailboat. They have all held up well, but eventually dulled (as expected). I only used this blade for cutting staight sections of 3/8"" aluminum in a cutting fixture (previous blades had been used exactly the same way and often a lot harder). No side loads or free hand cutting at all. The first three cuts were very fine and clean. On the fourth cut the blade self destructed, losing several carbides and teeth. I would not recommend this blade for anyone cutting anything thicker than 1/8"", if that."
4,Fun earrings,I got these for a friend of mine. She has dark hair and a fun personality. I thought that she would enjoy wearing these. They are very nice with a fun quality to them.
5,"Nice blocks, will last a lifetime","These are great blocks and look like they will last forever. I'm impressed with the quality of the letter cutouts, looks to be cut with laser precision. Colors are strong but not too bright, perfect in my opinion.The letters are not too much different than the English blocks (obviously just a few exceptions for the Spanish letters). However, the important thing to remember is that these blocks have animals on one side - all with the Spanish names. The numbers are also written in Spanish.They are just the right size for our 5 month old to grab in one hand, and practice his motor skills but will also be useful for a much older child to start spelling, math and maybe even make stories with the animals. And, of course, they'll be fun to stack up and knock over!"
5,super mefisto,with the avrige power card (lev3) he is a tough hand to hand fighting give him speed laser def and punch and practice driving him and he will give them a (perminent fat lip).ps(he is very powerful and one of the best one's for me)
2,Not worth it!,"This toy, although appears to be well made, just does not work as claimed. They don't move their arms. Needs constant reprogramming. Bought this and another of same kind. I have not bothered to open the other.In summary, don't bother with this toy! If you want this toy to just move back and forth, it probably might serve the purpose!"
4,can't get accessaries,Toy is a lot of fun but i can't find the accessaries for my robot (body armor)I tried on line but only the robot is available. I been to all of the stores that sell them with no luck. I own Lugnut and my brother has Me-fisto. We are also upset with the power cards. Not all of the cards work.
4,A Good Starting Pt. for Lee's Thought in Acad. Conversations,"Since this book takes Lee as an intellectual very seriously, it is a good resource for students in philosophy and theology, such as myself, who draw on his thought in their writings. I've been trying to find a book that would list the books in Lee's personal library, and I've found one.It's inspiring to know that there are academics like Bishop who are interested in giving space to Lee's thought in academic discussions in Philosophy or Theology.With regards to Lee's relationship with the non-martial art world (i.e., those who don't know or have no interest in the significance of the ""straight blast"" in JKD), I agree with John Little who, in this book, says that there are more people who can learn from Lee's ""motivational philosophy"" than from efficient self-defense techniques.Student of Pacific School of Religion(Graduate Theological Union) in Berkeley, CA."
3,Dance steps too complicated for light workout (with bleh music)- rest is good,"I really wanted to like this dvd. It's difficult for me to remember dance steps especially if it's that unmotivating ""generic exercise music"". I was hoping for simple dance moves on my day off because I put my all into my heavy days. The rest of the workout seemed pretty good. The instructor kept stressing how good & relaxing it should feel a little too often though. If the music were better, I could hop around doing my own thing- but I would have to do too much modifying to really enjoy this one- probably will not get much use. I've decided to try a light yoga toning dvd instead."
2,The Firm- Cardio Sculpt Fusion,I had a problem with this firm DVD because she makes you turn sideways for half the exercises for no real purpose and its annoying trying to look at the tv.
3,Good Idea but boring,"This book didn't really give me the information that I was searching for. I was expecting a book about how mother God is, but it mainly focused on her in history and how many people worship feminine deities. There are some inspiring stories though. This is a must read for Sylvia fans."
2,Scattered Introduction to an Important Topic.....,"As a reader of several Sylvia Browne books, in my opinion this is not one of the better written books. Although, I applaud the topic of the Feminine Divine Principle, it's history and current place in society it just isn't covered well in this book. Information is scattered and patched together from many different sources and put together in a ""hodge podge"" way. The Feminine Divine is a huge topic that can't possibly be squeezed into a small book and be done well. What the book does offer is; Sylvia's entertaining style, an introduction to the history of the goddess in different cultures, websites for more information and Ms. Browne's ""take"" on the Mother God Anza. It is a simplistic yet heartfelt introduction to a topic that I hope to see much more of."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I really didn't know what this product did. I bought it for my son, who is an avid modeler, but he has not found any uses for it. I understood that it was a product that helps hold models in place, or that you couldi use to create different pieces. It would be better to have a more detailed description for the uses and design of the product."
5,New laundry room,Couldn't find what I was looking for at the big box stores and found this one on line and it fits just what I needed.
2,Introductory,As a criminal defense lawyer who represents gang members it was an obvious read as law enforcement utilizes it to train their officers. Most of the information is dated and of little use. It is however a good starting point to understand gang behavior.
5,A good starting manual,This book is a good starting manual for those people that need knowledge in the field of gangs and understanding this life style/culture.
5,The Far Enemy,The Far Enemy: Why Jihad Went GlobalWell written. Very detailed. Some repetition. Very informative. Writer knows his subject. Should be required reading at the State Department.
1,"Poor quality, not as advertised","This vinyl cover was not 6 gauge nor was it 16"" deep. I have purchased 6 gauge vinyl mattress encasements from other vendors and I know the quality of 6 gauge.It ripped easily and wouldn't close around my 10"" queen mattress. A complete waste of money and effort."
5,Excellent selection of songs.,"I think there's an excellent selection of songs in this DVD. Although, the original artists don't sing the songs, the singers on each song sound very much like the original artists. The videos accompaying each song are sometimes romantic, sometimes sexy, and sometimes funny. I found them a little distracting at first, but one gets used to them and they make the whole karaoke experience more interesting. I only have a DVD player and TV (no microphones or audio system). The different sound tracks for no singers, male singer, female singer, and both can be selected with the ""audio"" button of the DVD player."
3,Great Show! ...so so blu-ray!,"The return of Bad Co... top notch performance! however I don't think this blu-ray was all that great!it had a lot of noise in the video and just didn't turn out that good! Audio gets about 9 video gets 7hope this helps out...The best concert I have ever seen in blu-ray is The Moody Blues from the Greek !in Los Angeles,Ca. That will blow your sox off!"
5,Creston Mapes.. Is a Fascinating Storyteller.. His Books.. are Fabulous.. Must Reads...cannot put down!,"I had the good fortune of Reading Dark Star, by author, Creston Mapes, shortly after publication. His story is gripping and real.. The story unfolds about a man, who is at the Pinnacle of a Rock and Roll Star, falling, falling.... He realises God Truth and The Healing begins.. I think Creston Mapes writing is a wave, your going to want to catch and Hang On! Kristan M. Root, Los Angeles, California and Cleveland Ohio"
4,wireless ear,"very good product but has limitations. sometimes when you leave the hs815 in your car and coming back with your phone you loose connection. then you have to turn the unit off and on in order to make it work again,but the big plus is because i drive a truck the hs815 is the loudest unit of all. i love the speaker and i can hear perfectly. Amazon service very good but i had to wait over 10 days to be delivered in canada Over all i tried h3 h300 h850 all by motorola and i find the HS815 the best for the money G.RISKA ONTARIO CANADA"
3,Great product!!!,"I am a professional woodworker and not an airbrush artist so I don't know a whole lot about airbrushes, but i bought this product not expecting it to last long or work all that great because it was so in expensive. Well I was wrong it works great and i use it constantly I highly recomend this product."
1,Poor Quality,"These tiles are far inferior to the other Eureka tiles I have. The tiles are made of a cheaper, lighter plastic and the letters themselves are poorly printed and hard to read. This is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon."
5,Godsend and a half!,"I am a PhD student with a miniscule office, so I have started to build a home office from where I can compile my research. I decided to add this white board this past month.Delivery: The freight company Amazon used called to schedule deliver, were there when they promised they would be, and put it where I wanted it in the house.Contents: The white board was received in perfect condition. It comes with all the mounting brackets, but you will need to buy screws to put them into the wall. It also comes with a marker, tray, and things to attach papers to the board if you like.Performance: the board erases perfectly and easily. I have no complaints. if anything, I am thrilled to be able to have such a useful item available to be delivered to my home."
5,The Bible on Distributions,No other book covers the elements of distributions and the fourier transform quite like Rudin's Functional Analysis. This is a must for every budding PDE-er!
1,Camco 25553 RV Precision Curved Ball Level,"This set of levels seemed to be quite good in construction. However, the adhesive tape did not last one full week before they were lost to the road somewhere. I suppose I should have screwed them down, but my buddy has another manufactures version that he had attached to his camper over a year ago with just the adhesive tape backing provided and they are still there. The surface area was thoroughly cleaned and minor scuffing to ensure adherence but........Off to find the version my partner used. This turned out to be a waste of money for me."
2,not the best levels around,You would have to be so far off that items would roll of of your counter before these would be handy. Don't use them at all anymore.
2,Shelby Foote should have narrated this book not G. Gardner,"Read by Shelby Foote, this would have been a priceless treasure worth every one of the $ but with Grover Gardner reading it we have an irritating, expensive, disastrous audio. Grover, who read ""Huckleberry Finn"" well, should stay with children's roles. Why couldn't Blackstone Audio hire someone with a pleasant, low, easy to listen to voice. Mickey Mouse would have been less annoying."
3,A very good book.,It was a very good book to read as my first book in the series. I liked how it started. They all got on the bus and saw the strange bus driver. They then went to the library that day and saw six gargoyles; the next day before school they went back to the library and only saw five!
1,NOT REMASTERED!,"This CD is derived from the same audio master(s) used for for the Renaissance Records 2CD ""Facades/Misplaced Ideals"" set.In fact, the J-card (the rear jewel case label) even states: ""Licensed from Renaissance Records""."
3,A decent product,"The suction cup mount for the Garmin Nuvi's is a decent device. It holds a great suction and doesn't fall off repeatedly like some other suction cup devices I have used in the past. However, I did run into some issues where the suction cup was permanently stuck on the windshield if it was left on the window for too long of a period. The first time I ran into this problem was when the device was on the windshield for about three weeks, but I was able to get it off by simply slipping a tooth pick under the rubber and breaking the air seal. The second time I took it off, it was on the window for less than a week, but it very hot weather and some of the rubber had melted to the glass when I tried to remove it.I guess the best thing to do is to remove the suction cup mount every time your done using the Garmin Nuvi for the day. This will prevent it from getting stuck to the windsheild and possibly melting to it if it has been left on it too long."
2,Not good enough by itself.,"I do not think suction cup mounts work very well. This one is no exception. While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight. I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my Nuvii. However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise. I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount. I have been cross country using this system and it works. the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself."
2,be careful of this,Not all cups fit all Nuvi's This one doesn't fit a 680 and you can't tell from the description.
2,Won't stick to dash,"My Nuvi came with this kit, but I only got the adhesive disk to stay a few days, and that's without having the unit suctioned on full-time. The suction cup sticks great - so much so that I have to break the seal even after releasing the lever. But I can't have it on my windshield full time and am sure the adhesive disk will not stay on in August/September, even if I could get it to stay on now. I do not see a way to purchase just the disk (guess I'll contact Garmin directly). I can't even just lay the Nuvi on a flat spot unless I disconnect the power cable. I suppose I will be forking out an additional $30 to try the beanbag."
2,Works great until you have to move it,"My mount worked great for about a year. I had problems removing it from the windshield when I was going out of town and wanted to use my Nuvi in a rental car. Pieces of the rubber stuck to the windshield. They were easy to clean off by using an alcohol wipe, but so much of the suction cup tore off that it no longer stays put for more than about 5 minutes.Now, it looks like I need to get another suction mount for my car and a portable one for when I travel since the suction cup mount is not portable as advertised. Of course, Garmin is more concerned with selling new units so there is a backlog if all you need is a replacement mount."
4,Good product.,Bought this kit as a replacement set and have had no complaints about it yet. Reliable and easy to use.
3,Beware of the Sun!,"Overall, this is a very good mount. It has great flexibility for positioning and holds well on many different windshields. I've used it for a couple years now in my own vehicles as well as numerous rentals. As others have noted, there is one major drawback...the sun. On a recent trip into California's central valley the rubber baked onto the windshield. After that the unit is toast and won't stick to anything. Unfortunately, you have to buy the whole unit. It would be great if you could just buy a replacement rubber suction cup. So bottom line, don't leave it in the window for long periods of time in warm sunny climates."
4,I love Dr. Greene!,"Although I read this book late in my pregnancy, I would recommend it to any expecting parents! I thought that his insight was more direct (and aligned to my own personal philosophies) than most expectant 'mom' books. Dr. Greene's other book, Raising Baby Green (my personal favorite), encouraged me to pick up this one, and I feel as though many moms and dads have a lot to learn from his experience as both father and pediatrician. Every question from should I eat organic to which diapers to use are covered- don't miss out on this book (it would also make a great shower or congratulations gift!)"
2,"Thorough, but tedious reading","Unlike most of Posner's other writing (his judicial opinions included), this book lacks the verve and wit that marks his style. What is here is a thorough examination of the Bush-Gore contretemps, in which the author concludes, quite persuasively, that almost everybody was right. Yes, the Democrats had a point -- Gore might have gotten more votes, had they all been counted. But yes, Harris was within her discretion to stop the vote-counting. And yes, the Supreme Court majority made the right decision to close the whole show.While his conclusions are interesting, the analysis makes for tedious reading as Posner drills down to the most mundane details of the vote-counting. It's almost like reading a political science text and times, and that's not a good thing if you are a general reader (Posner's target audience, I believe)."
1,Not worth it,Not a good video. Cheap clips of something filmed from someones old tv is what it looked like. Not worth the money.
3,Needs update,"This book has a fair amount of useful information in it for the price, but it is a little bit outdated."
4,Decent Introduction,"A decent reference. Steve Weber wrote a couple of books on online selling - with emphasis on Amazon. This one is focused on the bookselling elements. His approach is to use lots of examples, screen shots, and useful URL's, templates and suggestions on all elements of the business - from start through inventory acquisition, customer service and completing the feedback loop. I liked Mike Mould's book quite a bit better, as it had more detail and seemed more specific and up to date, however this is a very useful guide for the beginner."
3,Hamada Shoji,"A very cool book with interesting back story about the working relationship and mutual inspiration between Hamada Shoji and Bernard Leach, replete with old glaze recipes Leach translated from Japanese to English."
1,a confused an confusing guide,This book doesn't know what it wants to be. I found it not helpful and even daunting--something a gardening book should never be! Even the list of plants to plant is incomplete and hard to use.There are other wonderful books out there. This one is for people who want to make a real architectural change to their patios . . .not gardens.
5,touching story,This is a touching story about the true meaning of love and what relationships should be based on. Loved it.
1,Boris is a billion times boring.,"Pretty simple, this film is boring. I stuck with it and watched until the end, but no redemption whatsoever. I like many movies from this era, and am very patient with story lines. Having said that, I gave it the usual chance after chance, and even thought having Lee Grant might possibly save this one, but no. I can't think of any reason to recommend it."
2,Self Centered and Disappointing,"I read Apex Hides the Hurt after hearing part of an interview with the author on NPR. Perhaps if I'd heard the entire interview I would have known better. The field of nomenclaure consultancy sounds intriguing and a good premise to explore how we are influenced by names of products and places. However, the protagonist is an un-named and un-likeable character. His musings do not lead to any enlightening insights, even though the author may think they do. This book's writing is very contrived. I consider this book self-centered and disappointing."
1,Worked for 6 months,"I bought one of these switches in November 2009. Worked great until today, June 15, 2010. Tried to call dLink. Couldn't get tech support. The switch department selection on the phone disconnects you from tech support. Without a Tech Support case ID you can't return the product. Supposed to be a 3 year warranty! Dead in 6 months. Cash in the Trash! Get another brand switch instead :("
1,Not working - had to return it,"I plugged the switch into a D-Link router. The two could not communicate. I spent 15 minutes on the phone with D-Link tech support. They were very nice but could not fix it, and they told me I had to return the unit. Very disappointing!"
4,Love it,"well built and design. Very attractive price for a gigabit switch, can't complaint, just bought a second one for work."
5,Best piece of tech gear EVER,"How often do you get a piece of computer gear that requires NO screwing around? This is it. I got two of these to feed more devices on my home network. Within 2 minutes of opening the box, these are up and running. There's no setup. Just plug an ethernet source cord into one of the jacks, and plug devices to be fed into the others. It figures out which is the source, which are the others, and even compensates for long cable runs. Perfect product. And you might as well pay the $5 more for this one, rather than save a couple of bucks and get 3 fewer jacks."
3,Worked great until it died,"Purchased in November of 2008 and worked great for roughly two years and then died. The switch died. Forgot about the warranty, just threw the item out and replaced with spare unit. Didn't want to dock too many stars since all of the networking equipment I use is Dlink. The switch was cheap through amazon, so replacing wouldn't sting my wallet too much. They have since updated the model and hopefully it is more robust."
5,Good Fast Cheap What more could you ask for,"I almost did not buy this switch because of the reviews that said it would default to the slowest speed. It does not. I have it connected to my desktop at 1GB, my Buffalo NAS at GB and my wireless router at 100MB all work great. It was easy to setup, just connect and run."
4,Works Okay,"The power saving sometimes slows my ability to get to devices hooked to this switch, but once connected, performance seems good."
4,Fast and Reliable,"I've had two of these in service for over a year and they have performed flawlessly. Data transfer speeds are very good (1Gb transfers in about 30 seconds) and for my application (home networking and LAN parties) the switch is a no-fuss solution. Plug it in, connect it to your computers, and you're ready to roll. For the price, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option."
1,Hate to bash it....,"WELL, the game looked good enough, and I was excited to pull it out of the mailbox and put it in drive.. Up it came on my screen and away I went....in a singular dirrection. The control was a huge dissapointment, you have to use the mouse to turn left or right, and you cannot rely solely on the keyboard. (Forward and back arrows will move you forward, but in order to turn or shoot you muse access your mouse) So rather than turning left or right, you merely lean one way or the other. This mixed with the apparent ability to explore freely earned this it's single star. I can now see my copy staring at me from the depths of my little blue garbage can, already wasted 10 or 15 dollars on it, no point on wasting time on it as well. I am optimistic that the new one will be far better."
1,Awful game,"Terrible game. I don't know where the DX 10 elements are because this game reeks of 1998 graphics quality. It might be okay were it not for the cut scenes every 30 seconds. The action is nonexistent because you are constantly bombarded with cut scenes that never end, and there's no way to skip most of them. I got about 15 minutes into the game before uninstalling it in frustration. Seriously, avoid this one."
4,Art supplies,The art supplies are great inside the box and my daughter loves it. The only things I was not pleased with was that the screws holding the handles on one side came off before she even opened it. Also one of the drawer knobs came off. For a brand new set these things should not have happened. Overall it good set.
2,Could have been much better,I am a MASSIVE Paula Abdul fan and bought this in the hope that it would have all of Paula's videos on it. Sadly it only has 6 - Straight up is all blurry (Arsenio Hall has been blurred out for some reason? loyalties maybe??) - Rush Rush is not the full video. I would say buy this is you fancy a cheap fix of some great songs - but if you want all of Paula's excellent videos... well... they aren't available yet.
1,Heavy Duty Suspenders,"I don't know they would call these suspenders ""heavy duty."" Once of the clasps broke as soon as someone tried to put them on. I filed a complaint with Amazon and they sent a replacement. I am still not pleased with them."
4,Excellent introduction to copyediting,"This is a careful, methodical, and yet quite entertaining introduction to the basic skills of copyediting. Each chapter introduces a new element and ends with exercises to reinforce and test your knowledge. The glossary at the end of the book is also a useful reference, particularly in refreshing your knowledge of grammar."
1,"Sons of Italy, Unite!!","It is time to stop these stereotypes of Italian-Americans!This book relies heavily on the same images as 'that show'---big-bellied guys from Jersey who whack people who disagree with them. I don't know how anyone can read this stuff and take it seriously. There are so many lessons to be learned from great Italian-Americans who are law-abiding! What about many the firefighters and cops in the WTC? We should be holding them up as examples of heros, not this guy!"
5,Vanity Fair,"Get Anthony Schneider's Tony Soprano on Management-that's an order. Capisce?Vanity Fair (April, 2004)"
3,Good vacuum but I'm returning it,"I've really liked this vacuum -- good quality, nice features, light weight. But after just a few months the cord no longer retracts."
3,Great!,"Based on a true story. This is a really good movie, I watched it with a friend and really enjoyed it. It is a Disney movie so it has some effects for kids I would say. Cool!Service was great too! ordered and arrived in a couple days, no delays, WONDERFUL.I would recomend this movie for some nice family time together. Moral of the story, Focus, whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might. You have been given a talent, and you love it, use it for good! :)"
1,Sucked!,"I love golf and when this movie came out in theaters, i just could not get into it. I was disinterested, and i was just...i hated it!"
1,"DVD-""The Greatest Game Ever Played""","DVD requested arrived promptly but supplied to a UK address in USA format, therefore unplayable on coventional DVD. Exchange sought for UK version."
5,Worthy Of The Title,"This gem seemed to come and go from theaters with little fanfare. A true shame. While I too missed its theatrical run, I was determined to watch it on DVD. My family and I were not disappointed. The actors, set design and story were all top-notch and believable; a real credit to director Bill Paxton and the entire team behind this inspirational sports film.Shia LeBeouf is mesmerizing as a young man determined to make a life for himself in the world of high class society using his God given talent for golf. With a strongly supportive mother and working class upbringing, Francis Ouimet (LeBeouf) forges a name for not only himself but for all those not fortunate enough to be born into a life of privledge.Watch this movie, even if you only have passing interest in golf or sports films. It's truly worthy of the title ""The Greatest Game Ever Played""."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I AM NOT A CONTEMPORARY FAN BUT THIS ONE CAUGHT MY INTEREST....HOWEVER WITHIN 30 PAGES, I WAS READY TO CALL IT QUITS. OUR MALE LEAD IS BEYOND ARROGANT. HE IS DOWNRIGHT ABUSIVE.HE IS NEVER LIKEABLE. OUR FEMALE LEAD IS BEYOND NAIVE..ANYHOW 100 PAGES INTO I TOSSED IT WITHOUT HESITATION. I AM ONLY SORRY I WASTED MY TIME BY READING 100 PAGES........."
5,"Awesome, just awesome!","If you have a little elephant lover in your house then by all means, buy this book! It is the cutest thing I've ever seen and I'm glad to find out that there's more of Elmer than just this book. I about lost it when I opened it to read to my little one and saw a patchwork elephant who was trying to help a little baby elephant find his lost teddy bear. Then his cousin Wilbur was introduced and he is a black-and-white patchwork elephant. Okay, then I did lose it - I was really laughing at this book because it is just adorable. What an imagination! When Elmer and Wilbur (don't you just love those names too?! Cute!) find the lost teddy and return him, they also indicate that you don't have to be different to be special in the end. It's just very, very cute and lends a bunch to a child's imagination. We had to read this one a bunch of times tonight. What a great, great book!"
1,Bad Choice,This camera will become out of focus in a month. That is the reason it is cheaper. Look for a name brand next time.
4,4th Season Remains Strong,"The 4th season continues the very good character development and introduces new folks well. Eric and Tami continue to portray strong characters.With the last season over, I can't wait until FNL appears on commercial tv to see how things unfold. My only ""concern"" about this 4th season is with Tim, for example so deeply in trouble, will the writers resort to a soap-opera type finish."
1,Friday Night Lights,We ordered 2 Friday night light dvd's but got only one. WE are still WAITING ON THE OTHER DVD. I'm very unhappy with Amazon.
5,Love Friday Nights Lights,"The videos loaded easily on the computer and did not freeze, drag or skip. Love this show! Has just the right amount of drama, football, and romance all mixed in to capture the viewer."
4,CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS,"When iread this book,i really enjoyed it especially if you are planning to start your thesis and the instructions r very clear and short."
5,Saw Dr. Bolker live and was thoroughly inspired,"I haven't actually read the book yet, just got out of a writing workshop that Dr. Bolker led. It was absolutely helpful and I can't wait to start working on my dissertation, and read her book too."
1,Very Little About the Actual Dissertation Process,"The title of this book is misleading. It should be titled: HOW TO GET OVER WRITER'S BLOCK.There is very little about what you can expect and what you need to do to earn your PhD. There is absolutely NOTHING about how to write your proposal, which is arguably the hardest part of the whole process. The author simply skips over this phase of the dissertation the way she does nearly all the others: by simply telling you ways to motivate yourself to write.This book is the Dr. Phil edition of dissertation writing books. Just sugary motivational nonsense that might make you feel better about yourself, but only until you realize that you learned nothing.If you're a grad student writing your dissertation, then you probably can't afford to waste money (or time). So my advice: SKIP THIS BOOK."
4,Good text for grad level course,"I am currently teaching my first year of medical biochemistry and this book is a nice balance. Not as ""hard core"" on the chemistry as Voet & Voet, but more comprehensive than Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews or Baynes and Dominiczak's Medical Biochemistry. Similar in depth to Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry but slightly less emphasis on the medical aspects. Decent illustrations and the clinical coorelations boxed seperately within the text is a nice feature."
2,A MESS of a book,"I had to use this book for my Biochemistry class. My major is Nutrition & Dietetics, and I already graduated. This book is just awful. Like someone else wrote, if you need to find a term or a figure, you have to look in almost the whole book, and you may still won't understand what you were looking for, or even worse, you'll get more confused. Devlin finds the hardest way to explain an easy term or fact you can explain a lot easier. This is just not worth it. Do not buy this book, there are other books a lot better."
2,Not my favorite,The early chapters are good but I found the explanations of the pathways didn't flow as well as in other texts. The information seemed a bit disorganized.
5,Crazy and amazing show...,"For a no hold's barred type of show similar to Family Guy and South Park, enjoy this outrageous and hilarious show! I'm always laughing out loud and surprised with how much they delve into and how this show lasted for only 3 seasons and a movie!"
4,Defenatly a party in my box!,"perhaps not the wittiest humour out there, but if you are not offended easily... drawn together is sure too push your boundries and offend you at one point or another. never the less this show is fantastic and forces us to take a good look at ourselves (and others) and laugh about how politically correct the world has gotten.Also the unsencored content is a bit confronting at times... but worth the watch if you have seen the sencored tv version."
4,Love the size,"The size is right. It is working well for me. My only criticism is that the connector sticks out from my laptop rather far, making it vulnerable. The connector seems strong, but there is a lot of leverage. Even if it didn't break the adapter connector, it could break the laptop. It would have been better for me if the connector came out at a 90 degree angle.--Allen Brown [...]The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. --- Mark Twain"
5,"Hebrew, the Eternal Language","Excellent book on the history and development of Hebrew. One does not have to be a Hebrew speaker to enjoy it. I am a Hebrew speaker and amateur linguist, and I still learned a lot."
5,Sensational Vocal Album by Carole Farley and William Bolcom,"Carole Farley and William Bolcom have recorded this landmark CD, and I can easily understand why this CD received a GRAMMY nomination in the ""Best Vocal Recording of the Year"" and a 2nd GRAMMY nomination in the ""Best Engineered Recording of the Year"" category. It's indeed one of the best vocal albums of contemporary songs ever made. Carole Farley, who made her MET debut in the MET's first LULU production, seems to be just at home with Puccini, Poulenc, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and even Latin American popular songs (her Lecuona songs album is extremely beautiful).William Bolcom's accompaniment is brilliant, and the songs are a revelation.J.B. (Pittsburgh, Pa)"
5,A must read for single women waiting on God's best....,"I've heard it said that smart people learn from their mistakes, but truly wise people learn from other people's mistakes. I haven't been exactly wise in my choices of mates in the past, through God's word, and time, I've learned to slow down and wait and trust in God's perfect will. Settling for Less Then God's Best was a great tool to learn applicable, relational tools to help in that process. I've led a group of 20 women through it, and I give it to any single woman I know. Elsa's writing style is engaging and thought provoking. I highly recommend this book, or any book written by Elsa Kok."
5,good but..,I had them on at Home Depoe and people kept handing me charity dollars.Very sturdy well made and great clips
4,Full Moon vol.4.,Okay first of all I LOVE THE COVER! (Mitsuki + Takuto <333) I love this DVD cause it has my FAVIORITE episode.Episode 13: That Taki boy is evil at first but he really has a good reason. THe end made me cry its soooo sad.Episode 14: THis is a filler episode. But its fun to watch. :)Episode 15: WOOOOOOOT THIS IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE! :D!!! YAAAA!It's SOOO CUTE how Takutop is jealous of that stupid PLAYER guy. ugh I hate guys like Murakami!!! That @$$*$&&%*!!! I wish Mitsuki and Takuto had actually...gotten even cloiser..than what they did...;)... It';s so cute how the wind...randomly blew right there.hehehehehehe..Episode 16: ugh *sighs* THat Bi%^# Madoka. SHe'/s SOO much nicer in the manga.So basiclly: BUY IT!! Whatever you do you MUST WATCH EPISODE 15 :DOh yeah the Dub is Ok but could be a trillino times better.
1,way too small,"first of all the bag is only a little bit bigger than the wii itself. second, there is no room for the AV cords or games. to get the sensor bar into the case is hard to do without the bar snapping. the remotes buttons get pressed constantly while in the bag and there is no room for the cord on the nunchuck. there is also no place to put the console stand or sensor bar stand. there is a pocket for games but to get the AV cords in this pocket must be used. there are mesh pockets on the sides of the bag but the only thing that fits in these are the wii remote and nunchuck. this would be a good thing if the wii remote fit snugly in the mesh pocket and buttons werent getting pressed while in it. but to fit the AC adapter in the bag, the wii remote and nunchuck must be put in these mesh pockets."
2,Other option for transporting Wii,"After reading the reviews on roomiest of this bag, I went to Walgreens and bought a $10 padded cooler bag. It has 2 pockets on the outside and plenty of room inside. I think the bag is supposed to hold 24 cans. I will wrap my console in a towel and stow the rest of the stuff around it. Cheap and efficient. I also use a cooler bag for my portable DVD player."
4,A little small...,"The Wii Messenger Bag is a great tool to carry your system from location to location. In general the bag has great storage compartments for each of the Wii components. The bag is very well padded and is comfortable to carry slung over you shoulder.The only downside that I've found with my bag is that it is just a little bit too small. You can easily fit the system, power cable, AV cable, sensor bar, the little stand for the sensor bar, 2 Wiimotes (and their silicon skins), 2 Nunchuks, batteries, & 2 games in their cases. The system stand did not fit (which isn't the end of the world).So if you have more than 2 controllers, or want to bring more than 2 games...something isn't going to fit..."
3,Art and Visual Perception,"Good book, but I was expecting more images with description of contents rather than general theory."
3,Kindle Edition Not Worth It,"With the Kindle Edition for Mac, you cannot make photo copies of the activity pages as needed. This book works much better as a hardcopy resource. The content of the book is great. It will be wonderful for teaching my children and exposing them to advanced concepts. Again, the 3 star rating is because the kindle for Mac interface is very awkward for this book, and there are parts you just can't use because there is no way get a worksheet."
2,"Very hard to use, at least for me","This keyboard did everything I wanted except make it possible for me to type. I have a small tablet PC that I use on the road. Occasionally I need to type something long, so I decided to buy this keyboard. It rolls up just fine, connects just fine, resists spills just fine, weighs next to nothing -- it does everything but produce a letter on the screen when you hit it with your finger. I kept having to whack each key multiple times to make a letter appear. The space bar was especially troublesome. It took me so much time to type that I eventually gave up and just wrote on the tablet screen instead, because it was faster. I still want a flexible keyboard that works, though."
2,Great for teen,"This is a perfect gift for a teenager, it's a nice size and very pretty.After a few months it looks awful, it's so tarnished. Obviously not the best quality."
5,A must have for speciation studies,"This is an excelent book for anyone interested in the processes of speciation. The book is written so that an advanced undergraduate can understand it, but a proffessor of evolution can still get insight from it. Theories of speciation are well laid out and discussed in-debth. A excelent addition for any professional book collection."
5,Speciation is great,"Dude, amazon asked me to review this book... an invited review of Coyne and Orr's ""_SPECIATION_"" for my CV... Booyah!!This book is good news for anyone interested in speciation, and brainstorming material for any biologist who's willing to consider an evolutionary approach to his/her system or model or whatever.It would be a frustratingly difficult read for a non-biologist."
5,A classic karate video by an exceptional instructor.,"This is the first karate instructional video I've bought, and its still one of my favorites. There is so much information packed into the 90 minutes that it's difficult to watch it all at once. A great instructor and a really high quality video."
2,Not a Useful Buy!,"This tripod does not have have any defects as such but unfortunately does not prove useful for most photography requirements. It can only be extended to around 43 inches or so. From, my experience one needs at least 60 inch tripods to take pictures of people or interesting sceneries. Moreover, it can pan only in two directions, so this tripod does not help while taking vertical photographs.While purchasing a tripod look for these two main features- 3-dimensional panning, you'll need to turn the camera around both in x, y and z axis.- Also one that can be extended to atleast 60 inches.Trust me, you really need these features, if you are looking forward to serious photography.On the brighter side, this tripod is extremely light-weight and easy to carry around. But then the purpose of the tripod is to help in taking pictures, which this one is unable to."
4,I can watch TV!,This phone is awesome! I can watch HBO on this device. Of course its a charge of 4.99 monthly. BuT where i work i need this. but of course this phone isn't for everyone.
3,I guess nothing is perfect...,"The bad:1) Front Display: As everyone says this sucks, but I just want the time, and you can't even get easily unless you flip open the phone. That sux!2) MP3: the sound is FLAT with no controls to adjust the treble or bass. The front locks controls lock to quickly.3) Camera: Hard to get a clear picture. I expected a better picture.4) The USB connector cover blocks the volume controls when anything is attached.5) the overall volume of calls could be higher. I'm fighting to hear a call sometimes.6) Speaker phone and mute options are too buried.The good:1) Nice big display when open.2) MP3 even though quality could be better3) Picture view. I can take all my vacation photos with me now.4) NO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE NEEDED. slide the MicroSD card into a PCand go.It seems Samsung, just through a lot in this phone that was ""GOOD ENOUGH"", nothing stands out and nothing is great."
2,underwhelming,"The speaker on this phone is too quiet, you can't open it with one hand, and it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. The only thing I like about it is that it is fairly sturdy. However, I accidentally ran mine through the washing machine and I don't think any phone can withstand that. Fortunately, I hadn't paid for the phone. It was sent to me as a replacement phone by my insurance company. I would not get it again."
1,syncing into despair,"I purchased two lovely red syncs about ten months ago. After an initial honeymoon stage, the phone began to reveal some defects. It would not hold a charge, dropped calls...ect. I returned to the store several times the chargers and batteries were replaced but to no avail. Finally, the store manager told me to take advantage of the warranty. He examined the phone and observed that their was no physical or water damage. I took his advice and received two new phones. About a week later I received a bill for $420.00. According to the inspection the phones had water damage, so I was liable. I need to insert here that I have been with this company for 15 years and I have never gotten a phone wet. I sucked it up and paid the bill,however my new phones have all of the same defects. I have now purchased four phones and none of them work. I am locked into this contract for another 14 months. I AM DONE WITH THIS COMPANY. Take my advice find another server."
3,Not the one,"Item was not the item that i was expecting but i guess that's my fault i haven't take a look at it more rigid, I was expecting the one with IDE reader, regarding with the item i haven't really use it yet because i bought another one that has an IDE reader with it which is more functional for me rather than having just a SATA anyway over all the item was not that bad packaging, deliver and others stuffs are good."
5,My son loves this show,"My son is 3 1/2, and he loves this movie. It's presented simply, but includes a lot of detail about farms and how they work. My son knows that honey comes from an apiary, and that veterinarians give cows checkups. Good clean fun!"
4,New Take on Great Music,If you are a WA fan you will absolutely love this CD. I saw them play these songs in a live acoustic set in Chicago May 1999 and they sounded great then and they sound great on the CD. The intrumentation and vocals are top notch.
2,Poor Quality -,"Very hard to hear and understand the dialog, the video not that good, and the material was not Borge-level quality. Even includes the original ads for sponsor Kellog's Cereals."
3,"Rough around the edges, but a few bright spots","Audio quality is sporadic (what do you expect from 50-yr old film?), so expect to ride the volume control while watching these. Victor was a great pianist and the addition of humor made him a great entertainer. These shows repeat the same ""how modern composers create new tunes"" skit several times, and some of the other skits lacked humor. Otherwise, nice to see Victor's humor and piano artistry in action many years ago."
2,Brown university,"This is an inexpensive book, but if you know anything about Brown it is not helpfulminimal amount of insider info"
5,This is the dehydrator to buy!,We have been using this dehydrator since we took it out of the package! The heater and fan on the top are the best in design - no dripping juices onto fan/heater like other models. It fits more food on the trays and we are loving it!
2,beef jerky,The mixes were rock hard. We were still able to use them but it seemed that the packets were subject moisture some how.
5,Jerky seasoning kit,"We have tried a number of differnt jerky seasonings, always returning to N.A. jerky spice varity pack.The hot spice pack is alittle too hot for some people,so just mix original pack 50/50 with spicey pack. This makes great venison jerky, everyone ask every year for a large sample."
5,Derm Caps great for picky cats...,"I have 2 cats...1 is black and her dandruff/skin prob has been an ongoing battle for several years since moving to NY state. The bigger problem is...wait for it...she's a cat who hates fish, the hint of fish, the odor of fish. Sigh.So my vet and I have been trying every kind of supplement and finally...FINALLY...Derm Caps works. Whew!I bought the Economy pump bottle and add a 1/2 pump to some pureed chicken every other day. The fish odor is so low that the chicken masks it, and lo! Within 2 weeks I saw her flakes are down to nearly nothing. Pretty impressive, especially since it's turning cold and dry here.My black cat is no longer dandruffy grey!P.S. Pump is the way to go...easy to mask in food. My vet says it's on manufacturer back order at the moment (about $20 in the NYC area for the pump version). Grab it on Amazon at this price, it lasts quite a while and is effective."
3,moderately satisfied,"While I was pleased with both the price and promptness of the delivery of this book, I was dismayed that it was shipped in a plastic bag rather than a box. A result of the shipping was that one of the corners was severely bent. Additionally, several pages seem to have been ripped out of the book which I needed to complete assignments for class. This would indicate to me that the book should not have been labeled as being in ""good"" condition."
4,Still as Gore Obsessed as Ever,"With politicians breathing down their necks trying to censor the graphic voice of the Corpse's lyrical status, making them come up with less offensive album covers, and the depature of their initial lead singer, Cannibal Corpse is still going strong. Whether it be Al Gore or angry mothers blaming the band for their son's long hair, Cannibal Corpse has taken a lot of heat and will continue to do so. It is downright amazing that a band can go on without change through all the difficulties that Cannibal Corpse has had. They have even been blamed for being everything that is wrong with society today. With their newest release, ""Gore Obsessed,"" it is obvious that this bloody voice will not be silenced. They still remain as bloody, hard driven, and heavy as ever. This is a definite must in anyone's death metal collection."
2,I was disappointed,"Because I love Conran's books (and design sense in general), i was very, very disappointed when I got this book. It is very short on fresh ideas, and, perhaps even more disappointing, the photos aren't as varied and interesting as one usually finds in a Conran book. I flipped through when I first got this and saw lots of hallways and beds. I thought, 'well, there's probably more here so don't judge it right away.' I paged through and still found lots of hallways and beds. Very little in this book. Very disappointing."
3,Decent,"I have installed lots of systems and found that though this wire has the size of a 2 gauge appearance from the outside, the actual copper is more like a 6-8 gauge. Disappointed. The shipping and service was excellent."
4,You Get What you Pay For!!!!,"As with some of the other reviews, this set is definitely not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. The kit was great for the price. decent speaker wire, insulation is a little overkill on the power and ground wire, but works fine. I would throw away the wire loam, as that is about all it is good for. Go to local parts store and get sturdier loam. The rubber grommet included is way to big for the wire, you will have to go to Home Depot if you need a smaller grommet to get through the firewall. I gave it a 4 because it worked just fine for the money."
4,Sneaker-like comfort? Not quite...,"I am very pleased with these shoes in most respects. The leather is beautiful and durable, the style is cute and the heel is pleasingly short (a rarity in women's shoes), and for the most part, they're pretty comfortable. However, as a previous reviewer mentioned, they do tend to run a little bit small, although in my case, only in the toes, the heel is slightly too big. Doesn't grab onto my foot like I was hoping for. Also the sole is a little too thin. The sole is a soft, thin rubber with a little padding in it, which makes them deliciously quiet (can't tap dance with these shoes) and comfortable right out of the box. Unfortunately, that means you can also feel every bump in the road. No problem if you're walking on even ground, but the path from the office to the parking lot is filled with gravel, and I can feel it."
5,Excellent series and very interesting,I saw part of this series on cable and had to see more. Unfortunately they haven't come out with the full series on DVD yet - I think this is the only one available. It's extremely interesting viewing and shows a lot of research done with infants as support. I haven't seen any other programs like it.
4,Entertaining and funny,"If you find this in your local used paperback store, pick it up. Lots of good jokes. It's an interesting story, and the characters are pretty cool too. Not a masterpiece, and more of a novella than a novel."
4,Excellent,I love it. It'd have been better if the CD had the same songs as the DVD but it's still a good product!
1,In the dumpa,"In a classic case of betraying her true motivation for producing this disc, Sarah has copy protected it! One would think that she hadn't already made enough millions off the songs on it (What, maybe $10 million?) So, she copy protects it using SunnComm software to prevent her ""adoring"" and ""wonderful"" fans from using the music as they see fit. I guess making millions off her recordings is not sufficient. I would urge everybody inclined to like this music to examine Sarah's true motives - money, not pleasure! Skip it until she insists on removing copy protection."
2,Off the boil,"I have very much enjoyed reading the series by Barbara Parker of the Connor/Quintana novels. The first, Suspicion of Innocence, is by far the best, although the others are also an excellent read. So I was very much looking forward to the release of this newest addition to the series.I was sadly disappointed. The book is not ""bad"" as such, just off the boil. There seem to be a lot of characters and not much action and the ending felt rather weak. Perhaps the natural life of these characters has come to an end - it is a shame. I would still heartily recommend reading all the other books in the series, but perhaps wait for paperback for this one."
1,Suspicion of Mediocrity,"""Suspicion of Madness,"" Barbara Parker's 2003 mystery featuring Florida lawyer Gail Connor is so trite and predictable and Connor's character is so watered-down, that ""boring"" just doesn't even suffice as a review.Parker's treatment of attorney Connor verges on sexist, even misanthropy. But those words would require a story line worth staying awake for.Barbara, save yourself before it's too late."
5,What can I do on this road to nowhere?,"Well, you could listen to some Blind Guardian for a start. This is the first taste I've had of this band, and I must say I'm very impressed. The lyrics are beautiful and the music is powerful. Hansi Kursch's voice takes a little getting used to, but after I listened to this a few times I grew accustomed to it. Some people love it and some hate it. If you've never heard them before, I'd check the samples to see if you like the singer's voice, otherwise go for it. This is my friend's favorite band and he says this is their best CD. Get it."
4,Orange Goblin has changed...and it is good,"This CD is definately of a more hardcore slant v.s. the old style, slower sludge metal. I'll admit that it was the psychedelic tracks of previous albums (particularly ""Frequences.."") that turned me onto this band in the first place. But I love this new CD..much better than the last one, Big Black. The John Garcia (of Kyuss) tracks are just icing on the cake. This is a fantastic CD, but dont be looking for the psycho-stoner rock of before..this is a much more aggresive sound for them...and it is good. Enjoy!"
1,Supremes 1975,"I returned the product. It was not what was adverized which was the Supremes in the ""70's called ""the Supremes 1975"" featuring the song ""Early Morning Love""."
3,An interesting stepping stone on the Stratovarius journey,This album straddles two eras of the band. There is plenty of clunky early style stuff. But just when you thought that this might be like Dreamspace or Fright Night they pull out stuff like Father Time. Personally I prefer the live version on the Visions live double CD but this is still a cool track. Not to mention the fey sort of feelings invoked by listening to Forever. Try it with the lights out! However I can't justify more than three stars due to the feeling that these Finns were only just seeing beyond the front door and hadn't yet escaped their musical isolation.Though I was tempted to make this four stars due to the excellent Season of Change.....
5,Suomesta tulloo,"Kaikki paras tulee SUOMESTA, NOKIA, STRATOVARIUS, SAATANA, JOULUPUKKI ja SAUNA, PERKELE"
3,Great songs bad album,"This album really has quite a few good songs here, but most of the songs on this album die really fast. For me what makes a great album is one that I can listen to endlessly and still enjoy. For example I have been listening to Rhapsody for years now, and I can still put it in and enjoy it like it is new. A lot of Stratavorius' work does that as well. Unfortunately this album only has a few songs like that. This album doesn't really flow well in my opinion either. I have to skip songs way too much. I had originally loved the songs eternity and uncertainty but both of them grew old extremely fast. The only songs on this album I can really listen to on this album and still enjoy are Father Time, Will The Sun Rise, Speed Of Light, Babylon, and Forever. This is still a good album and Tolkki as always is amazing. This is most definitely one of my least favorite Stratavorius albums, but I still recommend it to any longtime fan or newcomer to Stratovarius."
3,Bizzy Bone Hits??? Not even close!!,"I have been a full supporter of Bizzy Bone's solo career for years, and I still am. But to call this the ""Best Of Bizzy Bone"" is an insult. Sure, they included a couple of tracks from his best release ""Heaven'z Movie"", and the twice released ""Fried Day"", but thats it. The rest of the tracks are from his last few, un-promoted albums released on Real Talk Entertainment. This company keeps re-using these same tracks over and over to get as much money from Bizzy Bone fans as they can. I am not saying I dont like these tracks, but they are not his ""Best"" as they claim. They completely skipped tracks from 3 of his best albums (The Gift,Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End). If you really want to hear the best of Bizzy, go buy Heaven'z Movie, The Gift, Alpha & Omega, and Beginning & The End. Other than that, just wait till this fall when he releases his new major label album ""A Song For You"" on Virgin Records."
2,opps,"Was expecting to see a bed full of spinach seedlings. What i got was a bed of lettuce seedlings and 4 spinach seedlings, obviously someone had an accident at packaging."
2,Did not grow for me,"Planted for fall harvest in CT. (August). Did not have a successful harvest. After 60 days, none of the seedlings grew beyond 1"". The entire crop was lost"
2,Alpha Centauri: Great Elevator Music,"You know when you are in a shopping mall and enter one of those lifts with background music from a loudspeaker and your thought is a 1 second contemplation wondering ""Hmmm this music is nice"" and then when you leave the lift you forget about what you heard?Well this music is just that. Not at all what I expected from a group calling themselves 'Alpha Centauri'. Even the song titles belie the fact and misinterpret what the song may sound like that. This music is jazzy/electronica and pop mixed together. Its a totally missable album and I will not be listening to this CD again."
4,Great book for motorcycle riding,"One of the few books dedicated to motorcyclists. Great pictures, and insightful content.The organization of the book makes it a little confusing or difficult to find something you are looking for. But once you find the content, the information is great.I just came back last week from riding in California, Oregon, and Washington, and I read this book just before leaving. I tried portions of the rides suggested and was very pleased. Most of the rides are loop oriented, meaning they bring you back to where you started from, while we were riding through those States. But I just picked interesting legs of his trips and included them in our path."
5,comfort,Padded seats have tedency to get wet and deteriorate over a period of time.This seat is as comfortable and will last forever.I have replaced both of my buckets with this top .
3,Adequate but,"The standard Sanskrit Dictionary for Sanskrit students is the Monier-William dictionary ... However, packing it around takes the entire back pack. For early years of study, the Apte dictionary is an adequate volume to pack around. However, you'll still need a Monier-William at home."
2,Not useful,"I bought it for my son's medical school interview. We were disappointed that nothing really taught us. Not helpfull at all. Though my son was admitted in medical school, I still could not give high score for this DVD."
4,Just what I needed,I was concerned that a mini coax would not carry a clean signal. But this works just fine to connect my converter to the TV.
2,Non disclosure agreement is very basic,I thought for the money I would be getting a more detailed non-disclosure agreement. This is very very basic information. Can get better free downloads on line.
1,Amazon sent me a used clipper (yuck!),"Encouraged by the nice reviews about the Wahl 79900, I was excited to open the package. However, there were short pieces of hair within the clipper set box and in the blades of the clipper itself. This was gross and totally unexpected as it was not supposed to be ""used""!!"
5,Great product.,"I got this as a gift for my father and he really likes it. it does a great job in cutting hair. Although, I would prefer that manufacturer will sell this item with fewer pieces for hair trimming. Very often 90% of them not needed.Bottom line is that I would definitely recommend this item to anybody!"
4,Easy Clippers,"This is my first pair of clippers, but they were easy to figure out and easy to use. I buzzed my husband's hair right off! :-)"
3,Good value for the money,"I have learned now (after my third clipper of this type) that you truly ""get what you pay for"". Not a bad product; does the job but it is NOISY !! You need to be diligent about lining up those adjustment blades with stationary ones- but all in all, good product for the little money you'll spend."
1,Complete waste of money at any price,"How do you make a quality hair cutter for $25 ? Answer: YOU DON""TThey are trying to compete with the Chinese made Conair kit but that kit also is junk, I tried two different Conair's and this Wahl none of them can cut hair and my hair is quite thin. Pay more it is cheaper in the long run."
1,Received used product!,"When I opened the package this hair cutter came in, the box was ripped, the trimmer was lying loose with the cord undone and had fingerprints on it, the packages with the accessories were opened and a few of the parts were also lying loose in the box! I don't think it's right to ""recyle"" a used personal care product such as this. Be careful if you order this item."
4,"good trimmer, bad case.","The trimmer arrived today. We tried it out by having the wife cut my hair. it trimmed it up nice and short. The finishing trimmer appears pretty delicate, but I think if handled carefully it will provide a relatively long life. Lots of cutter guides to use, theres even one for trimming eyebrows. Or should I say ""eyebrow"", because if you need to trim it, you probably only have one covering both eyes.I am not to thrilled with the carry case. Mine arrived cracked. it appears to be pretty cheap plastic and there are no separators inside the case so everything will slide around.I gave it 4 stars because of the case. It does appear to be a pretty good trimmer for a very inexpensive price. I guess if I wanted extreme heavy duty and a great case I could have spent 5 times more money. But I don't need to this time."
5,Great pair of Clippers,"I just brought the Wahl 79900N yesterday and boy do I love it!! I cut my son's hair using the 1/18 clip(or whatever it's called) and it gave him a nice even cut. I hated taking him to the barber shop and waiting 2 hour to get a haircut, what a pain. Now I can always keep him fresh to death and not waste 2 hours of my life in a loud barbershop.My only drawback is the trimmer that pops up, it doesn't give a good clean shape up. I will just buy a T-Line separately. But overall I am very happy."
2,Too small for (most) adults ..,"Had ordered the adult size and found it too small for regular usage. It hardly provides any neck support, which is very annoying and painful. Too small in size and perhaps that's the reason - The naming of product is kinda misnomer. The quality of product is good and my friend recently ordered an XL version of the same. The XL size was fair for adult usage. So if considering buying it for adult regular usage, XL would be a better option."
1,Worst Bean Bag EVER!!!,Bought 2 of these for my 9 and 7 yr old to sit on while playing video games. After only 3 months of sitting on them for VERY limited amounts of time they were flat as pancakes!!! The stuffing does not hold up at all and they are a completely worthless waste of money!!!!Very disappointing!!!!!
3,way big,"I expected that materials of fillings are bean shaped, but actually they are random piece of junk nylon forms which made me difficult to reshape the chair as I want. The chair is way big in my tiny room. I should have known it when I saw the product pic."
1,unlikeable leads......,"Synopsis:The last thing Jason Kruger needed was a city woman and her catalog of love!He ran a lumber camp, not a lonely hearts club. But Amanda Pierce, matchmaker extraordinaire, offered wedded bliss to his crew ...and made him crave a life he never dreamed he'd desire!How on earth had Amanda found herself at loggerheads with a high timber man wearing a mountain-size attitude? If Jason Kruger hadn't written requesting a mail-order bride, who had? And if he truly didn't want her in his life, why was he trying so hard not to get rid of her?My Review:short and sweet-the hero was a jerk and a bully and the heroine was way too flighty and ""too stupid to live"" for the storyline and the time period-not recommended. Quit it about 125 pages in. 1 star."
5,Fastenating,"It is hard to believe that so many individuals and companies could have been so treasonous at the time our service personnel were laying their very lives on the line to protect their investments, reputations, and the world from the likes of Hitler."
2,what's the fuss?,"I don't know what the fuss is about. This book is a story with pictures, with more prose than imagery. The artwork is okay, but it's nothing spectacular. I was mistaken in thinking this book would be filled with exciting robot designs...it's not. The designs aren't particularly inspired, stylized, or dynamic. I would go so far as to label them ""dated"", but not in some kind of interesting retro sense.I'd give the imagery a B+. However, there's not enough of it either, which adds to my disappointment. It's too bad this expensive hardcover wasn't more of a softcover graphic novel. More pictures would have made it more satisfying.I realize I'm being somewhat unfair. I didn't bother reading it. I'm not going to. I don't care enough and find the overall presentation a bit dull. And the retail price, I think, is absurd for what you get."
4,*Great toning workout*,"I like this new firm toning workout. It is great to pair or alternate with another cardio based workout. I like Alli as a firm instructor and she is great at cuing in this workout. I love doing cardio but know the importance of strength training, so this is a great addition to my other firm workouts. This is a definite keeper in my rotation of new firms and the transfirmer series workouts. I think this one is worth a try if you are looking for a good total body strength training workout."
3,Trapped in Japan,I have only purchased a few exercies videos in my life. I am one that enjoys group fitness but after having a baby my time is limited. I gave this three stars becuase first the music is not energizing to me at all (not montivating) and some of her instruction verbally is too fast. Overall its better than nothing. It does work the upper and lower body together which is great which the whole tape is combination working more than one area at a time. I was sore afterwards and I only used 5 pound weights. I will be doing this one on the days I cant go to the gym and hope to get a basic tone out of it
1,Painfully dull,Had to read this book for a class and I thought it was horrible. After reading only a few chapters you basically have the gist of the whole book because it really doesn't go anywhere. It's just a repetition of car crashes and lude sexual acts which the author seems to be using as a way in which to carry his reader's attention. It feels entirely forced and is noticable that the author throws in random sexual acts and fantasies at the end of nearly every chapter as a way to keep his audience engaged. It seems like it could have been a decent short story but that it was drawn out into a novel without any clear direction of where the story is going. I feel slightly disgusted that this was actually published.
3,car crash sends man into sexual frenzy,"that's right! ballard, the accidentee in question, has a major car crash with a man and his wife. the man dies but his wife lives. but from then on all ballard can think of is sexual positions with relation to car parts. it is really much more than that, i dont want to give away the whole plot, but that is pretty much what the book encompasses. i bought this book, not knowing what sex addict this man is in it, but i do now. i cant put the book down, however. once i started it, i just wanted to get to the end just to say that i read it. i am not sure that i will get anything profound out of it, you might."
2,"Shocking, disturbing, certainly unusual...",...but I couldn't find the meaning of the book. What's it about? Sex? Psychopatic people? Cars'accidents?
1,Hollow Men staggering through a Hollow Plot,"The entire premise of the book was too thinly believable for me to accept - a maniacal doctor who's sexually aroused by car wrecks. He runs about photographing them, wondering whether the victims' genitalia were injured and masturbating at crash safety tests. As the book progressed, I found it harder and harder to believe in the doctor's obsessions - and in his desire to die. Admittedly, those factors do not make the book bad art, they merely make it repellent. Crash is not an entirely worthless book. It addresses a number of issues significant to present-day society. If you're looking for a masterpiece about sex and death, though, don't believe the hype on the cover. Look elsewhere."
2,Its Vile but well written,"My god, this is vile.We have from the 1995 introduction by Ballardto this 1973 novel......I would still like to think that Crash is the first pornographic novel based on technology.Basically this revolves around a group of people that get off sexually around car crashes and the injuries they suffer.As a feat of imagination its is amazing, but that's J G Ballard but many of the scenes are staggering in their baseness. He describes it as pornographic but there is nothing even shallowly exciting about it. Ballard must have been on a retainer for writing "" natal cleft"", if he was he made a fortune.Vaughn the anti-hero is officially the most repulsive character in fiction, hands down there is no one even close and I would love to accept nominations.An amazing writer but I couldn't wait to finish this. The introduction mentions metaphors that the novel is meant represent but I must be too thick to get any of it.A truly horrible experience"
2,zzzzzzzzz. . . .,"I couldn't have been more dissapointed by this book. I decided to read Crash on account of the numerous high reviews posted on Amazon.com by other readers. I felt nothing towards the characters of this novel. Indeed, aside from occassional disgust (with myself for actually continuing to tred through this garbage), this book stirred little or no emotion in me. In concept, the relationship between sexuality, modern society and technology is thought-provoking. Unfortunately, this book did little to analyze this topic beyond using it as a backdrop for the rather boring storyline. In the end, I just didn't care. Don't bother reading this book. You have better ways to spend your time."
1,Terrible shampoo,"This shampoo smells seriously terrible. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it smells like a mix between leather, bacon, and a old woodshop. My girlfriend even agreed with me about that. It's an awful smell. I have tried many different versions of dandruff shampoo and this one doesn't work much better than the rest of them. Not enough to make it worth the terrible smell. I threw it away."
1,I hated this,Yuck... Buy this product if you want to smell like a bon fire all day. I could even smell it after I showered the following day. The smell is very strong.
3,"OK for my needs, but just barely","First I need to state that I'm not using this 12v ""hairdryer"" for hair, or deicing a windshield. I'm using it to clear up the dew that settles on the objective of a large amateur telescope, so I only need to warm it up slightly. Therefore, I'm not really putting it to any stressful use. It's a good thing as this blower is not really a solidly built piece of equipment. In fact, it should be handled with care as it is a bit flimsy. It gets warm, not hot. It blows gently, not hard. It has only a simple on-off. Folding the handle seems to be prone to causing the rear housing to separate from the rest of the blower, so don't do it! If dropped from a handheld height onto a hard surface I'm sure you will find it irrepairably dead. BUT! It's darned cheap, in build along with price. Obviously, I got what I paid for."
1,worthless,This thing puts out less force of wind than me exhaling. THAT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. The air that crawls out isn't even hot. This is the most worthless product in the universe.
4,1968 camaro with 327 small block,I bought this for my 1968 camaro with a 327 small block engine and it fits but its a little difficult to get the last bolt in! Also your going to have to modify the alternater bracket. Otherwise its good for the price just be ready for a project and dont be in a rush!
3,great deal. should have bought more,"Honestly, these are great. however, they dont come with collectors. so its better to pay the extra 20 dollars and buy them with the collectors included. I have had them on for 3 weeks and they are already starting to rust.I should have spent that extra 100 to 150 bucks on headers.besides that, its great. you wont find a 16 gauge header any cheaper than this.on the 1980 camaro, there are some MEAN brackets that you have to take off for long tubes. i reccomend getting a wrench that has a bend in it, if you dont, then have fun. :) be sure you have plenty of patience and possible a torch somewhere close by."
2,Good for general information,"The book is a quick and easy read with good general information about erections and impotence, but it doesn't live up to its title. There is very little information on treatments besides injections and pumps.The prevention that is given in this book is mainly about staying healthy. The prevention methods given could be described for preventing almost every other ailment out there.I will be donating my copy to the local library to others can save the money. There are several other books out there that for a little more money give a lot more information."
5,At last-a toaster that works,"I purchased this toaster because there were two five-star reviews and I was not going to bring anything less than a five-star toaster into my home again-I have had it with the cheap, bad ones. This toaster lives up to my expectations. It is beautiful on the counter, easy to use, does not have a 3-prong plug and I love the reheat button. So far it is perfect for bread, bagels, even crumpets."
2,What a disapointment!,Well I admit I fell for the 3 - 5 star reviews and ordered one thinking that it would be fantastic. I was replacing a $15 toaster that didn't have wide enough slots and never toasted the same way twice. I took it out of the box and put an english muffin in it and waited for it to knock my socks off. It toasted the muffin and the handle popped up. Unfortunately my muffin didn't pop up. I was forced to get two butter knives and use them like chopsticks to fish out my muffin. Why didn't they design this to raise high enough to get a muffin to rise from the slots? My $15 toaster at least did that!Update 12/1/08 I bought a Cousinart CPT-160 It toasts my muffins with no problems and is as nice looking if not more than the Hamilton Beach 22110
1,"Good product, bad install, stupid licensing","You cannot use this product with Visual Web Developer Express. It makes you uninstall VWD(and uninstall then re-install .net 2.0) and once you install SQL 2005 you can't install VWD or any of the express products.So your choices for asp.net developers areA: Buy VS 2005 pro which comes with a developer copy of SQL 2005 in which case you wouldn't need this individual copy.B: Use VWD express and SQL 2005 express, but without any of the admin tools for SQL 2005.In short, buy this developer copy only if you plan to use some non-MS ide. The free MS editors won't work with this and the ones that cost money and work with this developer version ALREADY COME with it."
5,Every parent must read this book!,Wilson really understands how the biblical worldview plays out into all areas of life - in this case with respect to education. Great book.
5,australian dreaming,"an excellent book that integrates the art, culture and ethos of the indigenous cultures of australia with the relevant dreamtime stories, illustrations and photographs."
3,"interesting, but a chore to read","Season of Fire has some interesting behind-the-scenes political/military details, but you have to sift through quite a bit of uneven writing to find it.The writing style changes from pedantic to historical-colloquial to chatty to straightforward so frequently it was disorienting.There's a lot of good information there, but it's hard work to get to it."
3,Entertaining,"The Last Resort is light reading: mainly humorous but with some dark undercurrents. Too many of the supporting characters were stereotyped, though. I wish Lurie had been less predictable in populating the story, instead of rounding up so many stock characters (i.e., a pushy, overweight, right-wing, bigoted, midwestern real estate agent). Still, it's a fun book that provides a pleasant few hours of reading."
5,A gift,This is an excellent book that will touch your heart and reassure you your loved ones live on.

3,"White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd is basically faithful to the Andy Edmonds biography on which it is based, but ad","White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd is basically faithful to the Andy Edmonds biography on which it is based, but ads fictional details such as private eye investigating the case and an imprisoned gangster who tells him some of the details of the case. Roland West is portrayed as quite a bit youg than he really was, and Pat di Cicco is portrayed as quite a bit older than he really was. Somehow, Zasu Pitts is left out of the story altogether, Patsy Kelly is here portrayed as being Thelma's screen partner all along ( actually Thelma Todd was first teamed with Zasu Pitts ) but Loni Anderson did a good job of portraying Thelma Todd and altogether it made and entertaining mystery movie for television."
2,dissapointing,the book was pretty good at the begining but it dissapointed me after that.its got some good moments but its got more boring moments.i really tried to like it but i couldnt give buyers a misunderstood review.
3,COME...ON...DEAN...WRITE...SOMETHING...LESS...PREDICTABLE,"Okay, so it's not a bad novel after all. But it's not good either. Only readable. Go read Intensity, at least it's unrelentlessly scary. You'll figure out what this door to december is halfway through"
1,False advertisement,The tape measure pictured her is not what I received.I've been done wrong.The tape measure I got is far below sub-standard.
3,"Works well, but the color is off","I purchased this hoping to get purple but what I received in use came out a light pink when used on a dark background. It works ok if the background is light but putting it over black you would think it would be darker purple, but that's not how it works out."
3,Ok,I have used this product before and was happy with results. I just didn't like the color as much as I thought I would. That's a personal preference not a critique.
4,Broken Trail,"Unfortunately I saw the movie first and then bought the book, so I was hoping to see much of the movie in the book and that was not the case. I was disppointed in the structure of the book from the movie. The movie was much better in term of telling the story, however, the book have a lot more details, which the movie lefts out. (Hollywood, I guess). Neither book nor movie spent much time on the blossom romance between Tom and Number Three, which they allured to at the end of the movie. Overall, I would give the book a 3 1/5 stars and he movie 4 stars."
3,Peach Jollys,"I chose this package because it was the ONLY way to get the Peach Jollys.I think that the Peach or any flavor should be sold singularly, especially ifordered online is the only way to get them. The other flavors are not requiredand should not be included; it is a waist of time and money."
3,"Who is the criminal, who the victim?","Fast paced, violent and cruel play about a lowlife, Raul, who intrudes upon Marjorie, an unemployed young woman. He attempts to rape her, but she swiftly turns the tables, caging him in a fireplace and torturing him.This isn't giving away the story, because the significance of Extremities is in the behavior, especially of Marjorie, toward Raul, and her roommates, Patricia and Terry, who both come home and must deal with the situation.What makes Extremities interesting is the sort of fatal hand of timing, in that Marjorie seems to be at her wits end, and Raul's presence precipitates an unraveling that exposes the animal and the pain and anger in a young woman.The writing is fast paced, full of colloqueal slang, raw and brazen in it's frayed nerves.This is a quick read, and would be interesting and intense to see on stage."
2,Catch a piece of the dream.....,"I bought this book with high expectations... and though it kept my attention... it wasn't as good as I thought. I enjoyed the idea of the book... a black man making his way in the political arena.... but I didn't really like the book itself. It was set in a series of flashbacks, that at times only confused me more. I don't think that the emotions that the main character had were ever really developed between either woman.... therefore making the ending almost too.... bookish and unbelievable. It was corny actually. I finished reading the book feeling as though I had gained.... nothing."
4,Three stories in one,"this is the story of Henry, who's about to become the first black president. Cheryl was Henry's first love but things didn't quite work out for them, they still have a love of love for one another though, then there is Leslie, Henry's wife who feel she is second after his career. The story gives you a look at their life when they were young, and older."
5,Powerful novel,"Timm McCann displays his excellent writing skills in Always. The novel was very detailed in regards to dates, events and characters development. Dreams never die. I was very impressed with the drive and determination of Henry. Will Henry Davis II become the first African American president? This is a Must Read novel that shouldn't be missed. Congratulations Tim and best wishes. Be Blessed."
3,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed the characters, and his writing style. The storyline is refreshing, set against a political backdrop. Engaging and well-crafted. I would recommend."
1,Misleading........,The amp was very noisy was not what I was looking for. The information on this unit is misleading. I wad looking for a home amp and it ended up being a p. A. Amp. Needed to have more basic info. But Pyle is a good brand and I have bought other things from them. Good for the money......
5,Easy-to-read and easy-to-use,"I loved the book! There are lots of good tips and pointers, and for people like me who don't know how to do some home projects, the instructions were easy to follow and easy to use.I ended up buying 3 copies - one for me and two to give away to friends! Totally encourage you to check this out."
1,Not Enough to Bother,"This booklet is an obvious desktop publishing effort that has very little to offer. It takes about ten minutes to read, and the reader will come away wanting and needing far more information than this small booklet offers. Good information on this topic is hard to find, but don't bother buying this booklet."
4,What a story...,I could not put this book down.It is written so well that you are literally transported to China.A survival story not to be missed.
1,Terrible,This ravor is terrible. It left me with razor burn and didn't remove all unwanted hair. Don't waste your $$.
3,Not as good....,"Product is OK but not made as well as my old Panasonic model that this replaced. Unfortunately my old one died but lasted quite a long time and was made sturdy. This new model seems flimsy and not made as well, but it does the job."
3,Not the best product for fine body hair,"If your hair is fine and baby like, you have to go over and over the hair repeatedly to get it off. I guess I am going to stick to shaving with a razor which seems to work best. However, my sister tried it on her legs, and she liked it a lot so I gave it to her."
2,Stick with Remington,"Thought my mom's electric Remington razor that you have to plug in was outdated so I decided to get the Panasonic. Not only does it not provide the same close shave that a disposable razor would give, but I find myself having to shave the same area multiple times in order for it to actually remove the hair.Extremely disappointed. There must be better products out there."
3,Okay for the money,"does not give a close, touchable shave at all. wet or dry, with or without shaving cream, doesn't make a difference. Okay for last minute shaves when I wasn't expecting to show any leg. Luckily I have very thin, light leg hair.Bikini attachment is a joke, completely useless. Pop-up trimmer comes in handy somewhat for already ""trimmed"" areas.Doesn't even come close to a regular razor blade shave.For what I paid, I'm not terribly disappointed though. I've spent much more on other electric shavers that did a worse job."
5,love this shaver!,"I could no longer shave my underarms with a razor due to a surgery. Dr. said I had to use electric. I couldn't imagine it would work. It was important that it not nick my underarms at any time. I read the reviews and chose this one. I have been using it for a couple of months and love it. It's easy, has never nicked me and really shaves well. Great purchase. I would buy it again in a minute"
5,The Best Of The Best,"I can't believe the way this Panasonic cut so close and left my wifes legs as smooth as you know what. It's the first shaver that cut so close and she had no knicks as in the past with other shavers. She is very pleased and so am I because We found the ""Best of the Best"", finally. It's new and I hope it continues to give her close shaves because stubble is not good."
3,It's okay,"Does the job when my leg hairs get long. It's not my standalone shaver, I also use my No No and regular razor and my husband's braun for my facial hairs. I hope one day, the industry can make women shaver comparable to men's shaver that has nice dual blades for shaving close and is made of good quality (many of those for men in the market)...I dislike the fact that to this day it has not been done."
2,ok in the beginning,The shaver worked OK when I first got it but after a few months it stopped working very well. I don't shave everyday. Maybe that's the problem. I know you're suppose to change the foil and the blades after a year but it wasn't even a year before it stopped working. This is the second electric shaver I got. Never again. I stick to the old fashioned blade razor.
4,Great razor,The razor itself is great. The bikini attachment is useless. I got a nice close shave on my legs and no razor burn. The bikini attachment acted more like a brush than anything and I dont need to brush my bikini area! LOL
3,Not blown away...,"This is the first electric shaver that I've had, so I can't compare it to anything else, but I'm not incredibly impressed. For one thing, if I don't shave every day, it doesn't work well- it doesn't get all of the hair. And forget it if I wait a week or two- if your hair is long at all, it won't even work. Perhaps this is the nature of the beast, but I don't like it. Also, after a few months, I've found that the motor seems to be weakening considerably, even when it's fully charged- of course these things will die eventually, but this one seems to have an especially short life."
3,Not as good as expected,Stays charged for several uses and the pop-up feature is nice. I have fine hair on my legs and it doesn't do a very good job. I have to go over my legs many times. I was a little disappointed. Would probably work better on coarse hair.
3,Auch!,i decided to buy this for Bikini area.since razor gives me rashes and ugly red spots all around the bikini zone. i found that if i use bikini device it will trim the hair long enough to show! so i used it without the device. the same horrible rash plus AOUCHHHHH it pulled my hair and scratch me.generally i think razor is easier than this.search more for better product.
1,Power adapter only 110V,Very bad that power adapter for this model only 110V. My wife can't use it in Europe. Only for US use.
3,"ok, but...","If you have any kind of condition that gives you thicker hair growth, this shaver is OK. It takes work though to really trim that hair down. It will do it, but you need several passes. If you have fine hair, I'm sure it will do the job just fine. As someone who has hirsutism, I need something that can cut cut cut all over. This is decent. Not excellent. Not bad, just kind of in the middle of the road compromise to get that shave, even if not as easily as I'd like.You still can't beat a regular blade, it's not as good as regular razor. I mostly bought it for pubic shaving, and it works quite well for that, since I don't like super close razor shaves as I break out. This helps shave it to skin but not beneath."
2,Charger Inefficient,"I've had this shaver about a year. I thought it was charging efficiently but I was wrong. The charger is a square that plugs into the wall and the shaver sits on the charging station. However, mine wasn't able to connect properly and when it died I was unable to get it attached to the charger properly. Now I have to buy a new shaver."
3,A little disappointed,I thought this would be a good replacement for my remington - not real happy with this one. It's not really a smoothe shave - somewhat like plucking out hairs instead of a shaving.
3,I should have known better!,"I saw this product adverstised on the Today Show arround the Christmas holiday. I am usually spectical when purchasing prior to testing a product. I should have stuck with my gut feeling on this one, I am so disappointed that I wasted my money. I was unable to get a smooth shave dry, and it was unconfortable to get shave the whole leg. The shaver is not comfortable to hold, I had to reposition the devise to shaver. althought it's advertised to be used wet or dry, I don't want to risk damaging the shaver by submerging in water."
2,Very cheaply made product,"It didn't cost a lot, that's true. But the plastic slider pieces are so poorly made that I can't get them to move half of the time. One of them is the on/off switch, and the other releases blades. Not complaining about the shave, when it works it works as well as any electric shaver."
2,Lackluster,"This shaver does not hold a charge and does not come close to shaving like a razor blade. Granted it's the only electric shaver I have ever used, but I was very disappointed with the product."
4,"Convenient, but trouble getting a totally smooth shave","This is my first ever wet/dry shaver so I don't know if using one dry usually results in a faint stubble left behind, but that's what I get. Results improved with wet shave and shampoo. Haven't tried with cream. Still, very convenient for when I just don't feel like showering to shave. Comb attachment does its job, too, though I noticed the pop-up blade sticks a little after a few uses. Hard to work that with slippery hands."
2,Awful product,"This barely even removes hair and pulls and snags on any you have. I thought I'd have less nicks with this but actually it gave me some really deep cuts. It also takes forever to use because you have to go over the same spot again and again. Additionally, it gave me razor burn. Definitely don't recommend."
1,Doesn't Shave! A Waste Of Time And Money!!,This thing is pointless. My big idea was to be able to shave out of the shower b/c my toddler gets impatient waiting for me. Figured it would be a great time saver. I go over one place slowly and nothing! I get maybe a few strands. I spend MORE TIME going over one spot then I would doing my whole bottom half of one leg with the razor. Of course a razor has better results that last longer too. Don't even get me started on the bikini trimmer. First you think it might just need adjust since it has 3 levels of height. Nope!! Forget it. Wasting more time. Just get the darn trimmers out and razor and be done with it. This thing stinks! What a waste of money. Electric razors just never work is what I conclude.
2,Okay,"Not as good as I expected. I wouldnt recommend it, i do recommend purchasing one that costs a little more and offers better performance."
2,Unhappy use,"Received this product. Two weeks later cleaned it with the brush provided. started making a horrible sound, metal piece on front fell off and not does not remove the hair. Have had electric razors all my life and this is the worse. Cost more to replace the head than buy a new one."
2,Not the best,"I received it as a gift and was very hopeful. I use it for underarms and also bikini area. The underarm area is fine, but it pulls the hairs on the bikini area - very painful! I'm just not happy with it."
3,Better than Remington,Much better than the Remington shaver it replaced. Doesn't get a real super close shave but I knew that with electric shavers anyway. It's ok for what I need it for.
5,GREAT SHAVER,My wife loves this shaver. In and out of the shower its fantastic. The adjustable head and bikini attachment works perfect.
2,Not what I expected,"I have an old Remington razor that is 10 years old. Went by the recommendations, should have stuck with experience."
5,Love it!,My daughter received this for a christmas gift and it has solved all her shaving issues. She breaks out normally in the armpit area from regular razors. She loves this and no longer has the rash and pain. It works great on her legs too. I did research the item prior to purchasing an electric razor and this one has definately held up to what was recommended. I highly recommend this item!
4,Panosonic razor,I was in need of a razor and I purchased this one to fill my need. I am pleased with the transaction. The price was right and everything went smoothly!
5,Supreme!,"I am in love, Love, LOVE with this Panasonic women's shaver. It does exactly what I need it to do and works perfectly for me. I can't believe I waited so long to switch to an electric shaver."
4,Shaves Wet or Dry,I have used this product for the past 2 months. It is very convient for major jobs and a quick touch up if I prefer to not use a razor. I am happy with the results. Also the Panasonic has been reviewed favorable by independent groups and that also influened my selection. I like the product enough to recommend it to anyone. The price is right too.
2,Not a close s have,"Was pretty disappointed, I do not get a close shave at ALL! I was really excited about it but does not make my legs smooth."
2,Not effective,Not the best shaver in the world. This thing could not get a hold of anything. I would not recommend it. Maybe is just got one that was defective.
4,Cute,"Wish it was bigger. Love it though, very cute with the tootu! I need to look for a larger one for more money!"
2,NOT large - read descrption very small,"The piggy bank is only 5-6"" big. Not LARGE at all. The product arrived arrived in a damaged box, part of the tutu was hanging off and you can see the hot glue coming out from the top. This will be returned immediately. Highly dissappointed as its for a first birthday gift in a week :(Gave 2 stars because if it arrived undamaged it would have been cute.. But not $20 cute"
4,Precious for baby girl,"Bought this for my niece's 3 month birthday, just precious! Looks beautiful in her nursery. Great gift for a baby girls room-would for sure buy again, and reccommend to a friend!"
5,"Moving, Soulful folk-pop","Kristin Plater's ""24"" is an excellent showcase for her moving songwriting, mature songcraft, and awe-inspiring vocals. Plater has a talent for making unique and personal experiences seem universal, as her relationship-themed lyrics vividly describe situations and perspectives that everyone can relate to. While her situations reveal a keen, everyman's sense of the connections that humans make with each other, her voice - gritty, powerful, beautiful - is uniquely singular. The production on the CD is eclectic and always interesting, lending muscle to Plater's songs. ""24"" is the CD of a fresh talent on her way to stardom - catch her slinky, sexy ""Convince Me,"" her epic and powerful ""Someone Else's Arms,"" the bluesy, bouncy ""Lying,"" and ""The Life I Need,"" which shows off Plater's voice masterfully."
3,A good challenge,"I have been doing Tae Bo for almost 3 years and bought this DVD as a challenge to test my level of fitness and endurance. It's long at around 90 minutes so certainly tests your stamina. However, it is not what I would consider one of Billy's more intense workouts. If you're looking for a stamina test, this is good. But not one you'd do regularly, so you might be better to buy something shorter and more intense if you're looking for a daily workout DVD. For this, you can't go past the Tae Bo Bootcamp series!"
3,A little disappointed,"After reading all the reviews, I was very excited to get this video. I thought for sure in 90 minutes I would be challenged. I wasn't. I was barely sweating when I was done, and I've been doing this for years, so I know how to do the moves correctly and with intensity. It was fun, so I may keep it as part of my collection for that reason. But if you are an advanced exerciser, this is NOT the video for you."
4,GREAT workout but you have to get creative,I am an avid tae bo fan and I have to say that this workout was awesome accept for the dance section in the middle. I did jumping jacks and ran in place...I wasn't going to waste my heart rate on gettin' down.Only complaint
1,Disappointing,The old versions (VHS) of beginning and advanced taibo were useful andactually fun. This DVD has boring routines. After going through the set of routines I felt like I finished a job. If you like frenetic air-punching you will like this--he does that every few minutes.
3,"BY FAR NOT ""ULTIMATE""","This is by far not his most challenging dvd. I was ready for a really amped up workout and instead barely broke a sweat by the end of the tape, even though it was 90mins. I would highly recommend the Advanced TaeBo DVDs, which are tough and really make you sweat. This one is more like his basic workouts, slow paced, with really bad music. I had to plug in the Advanced workout afterwards and do that to feel like i've accomplished something. Also, not particularly motivating seeing Billy with a bit of a gut, Shellie and the rest of his ""supporters"" sporting bellies, cellulite and fat instead of the lean, muscular and toned people he had in other workouts. I would probably do this on the days Im feeling lazy and just need to do something to get a little exercise."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is a typical drug store mystery set in the mountains of North Carolina with an improbable plot, almost no character development, sophomoric writing, and an Indian tribe who turn out to be descendants of slaves owned by an Indian tribe. The only redeeming virtue of the book is a use of herbal medicine within the plot. It contains its own bromide, so to speak. Don't waste your time and money!"
2,Too witty,"I've read two of McCrumb's mystery novels now and had the same reaction: witty murder is hard to take. I won't be reading more because I seem to take murder a bit too seriously for this light, fluffy sort of treatment, where the author's emphasis is often on cute dialogue and witty repartee.That said, the story here has three young people dabble in murder detection and forensic science because-naturally-grownups don't care. Several passages are very well written and McCrumb maintains a tongue-in-cheek touch elsewhere. Don't rely on either the science terminology and interpretations to be accurate even for the 1985 paleo-computer age. Other than the pedagogy, this story will entertain young readers and introduce them to an unusual Appalachian setting and the issue of proving Indian land claims."
3,How much can you gain from a book?,"As a Shaolin practitioner I find this book to be accurate regarding the kind of flexibility and strength that one will gain from genuine Shaolin practice. No normal person would actually do this workout on their own for very long; it is just too strenuous to endure without encouragement from an instructor.As an example of what a Ch'an priest should be... that part is questionable and perhaps not that important to most people who would buy this book. The sheer amount of self-promotion and marketing (this book is only one exmample and certainly the most ostentatious) to come from a ""buddhist monk"" is disconcerting... not to mention Shi Yan Ming's obvious appreciation for his own photo demonstrated in hundreds of pictures of himself in every dramatic and complimentary pose imaginable.That said, I will keep it as a picture book that shows incredible examples of what a 42 year old can when he is in great physical condition!"
1,I expected more....,"The book is very small in size and scope. I expected more from a shaolin monk. It has several short anecdotes about how he tries to talk hip <rolls eyes>. If you want a book about simple stretches that any martial artist that has spent anyone time in a Dojo or in Kwoon, then get the book.If however, you happen to be a little more educated than a white belt when it comes to martial arts, then get something by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, he can be found at YMAA.COM"
4,excellent book if you love naval history and adventure,"Dewey Lambdin does it again.A worthwile, exciting read"
2,Still waiting for a response about sizes,"The sizes of Small, Medium, Large, Extra large are meaningless. I need measurements in inches.I sent a request to the vendor for more detail but have yet to get a response 6 days later.Not sure they really care about a sale."
4,Useful and easy to follow with only one flaw,"This is an easy-to-read, comprehensive guide for those wishing to learn about the various uses of essential oils, what they are, and what they cure. The last section of the book, where more extensive information is given about each essential oil (scent, uses, and cautions), is especially useful to ""intermediates"" who wish to begin creating their own recipes and blends. The only drawback is that some 70 oils are introduced and used in the recipes in the book, which means a beginner who wants to experiment with these recipes will have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get started. I definitely recommend it for someone who knows a bit about oils and already has an EO inventory of their own."
5,Greatest Buy!!!,"Just for the Silk Therapy, it's more than worth the $28. For a bottle that large, I would have to pay at least $40 here at home! So it's far less for that product and the shampoo and conditioner are an incredible bonus and very good products."
4,"IF YOU'RE A JOE LOUIS FAN, YOU'LL LIKE THIS VIDEO.","This video contains exciting knock-out scenes from many of Joe's memorable fights, and it brings back the thrill of watching the greatest of all heavyweight champions at the peak of his fighting prowess. My only criticisms are, it didn't show enough of the fights that it featured, and it should have featured more of Joe's fights. In other words, I would gladly have paid twice the price for a video that covered Joe Louis' career in greater depth. Nevertheless, it is well worth the money, and it belongs in the video library of every Joe Louis fan."
2,Not sticky at all,"I saw a previous review of the same issue, but with all the positive reviews I decided to give it a try, hoping it was just one bad copy or the problem had been fixed. But no. The non-stickers fall off right away and are rather useless."
1,Great show but not Region 1,I ordered the DVD from this page from a seller and I received a PAL DVD. This title DOESN'T EXIST IN REGION 1 FORMAT. Do not order this title unless you have a PAL Format friendly DVD.
2,Too weak for George,"This product (made overseas) is a terrible investment. The stitching unravels from the waistband prematurely causing the waistband to separate from the brief. I have purchased many pair of these, catching on a bit too slowly. If George Forman knew how fragile these briefs were manufactured I am certain he would have his name removed from those separating waistbands. They are not worth $8 per unit....I say $2 at the most. I am currently seeking a comparable ""Made in USA"" product."
5,Great Fit & Nice Look,They fit fine. I am satisfied with this purchase. Will be buying more as needed. I like them better then Jockey.
5,Very comfortable feel and fit!,"I like a fuller fit brief. Before my Harbor Bay purchase I used Fruit of the Loom and Hanes 2XL which I would buy a Walmart for around $10-11 for a 3 or 4-pack(sometimes less if on sale). The price increased significantly at Walmart and at a couple of stores it appeared as though they weren't carrying the 2XL at all and started carrying their own house brand. The no-name brand was about the price of Hanes/FOTL (before the price increase). I tried the no-name and its 2XL was about the size of a men's MEDIUM(a waste of money for me). The Harbor Bay is great and even after washing, no shrinkage. My only complaint is the price: 2 pair for $20. I guess buying underwear in a big man's shop will motivate me to lose weight., But the product itself is excellent."
2,They ship Harbor Bay instead.,"Unfortunately, Casual Male ships Harbor Bay brand instead of George Foreman.It's a shame for Amazon to deal with them."
2,Superficial,"This book is imho quite superficial. To my regret, it doesn't really cover the order of Odin (because, as the book says, the Order of Oding is only rumors). Another thing I really hate about the book is the front cover. It shows a man with a hornet helmet - no viking helmet with horns has ever been found... A bit too 'mythical' for me! Apart from that the book is quite boring."
5,solid sturdy cable,"Have had no problems with this cable, been using for 4 weeks now. Connects my Peavey mic to my Behringer Mixer and is solid and sturdy. Great Price as well.-Doyle Clarkwww.doyleclark.com"
1,"Cable broke after 5 weeks, just after Amazon return Window expired.","I am giving this cable 1 star because it worked fine for the first 5 weeks.No wonder the cable now cost $2 dollars less than what I have paid for it about a month and a half ago.BTW, what is the average lifespan of an XLR cable? It is my first XLR cable, could not recall having cable problems in the past, even with the cheapest ones; but again those were not XLR cables."
5,Wonderful purchase experience,"Received item very quickly and in great condition, would definitely purchase from again in the future!"
1,Unfit for its intended purpose.,"Rather than being made to the dimensional tolerances necessary for a solid and secure fit, this cable's connectors were designed with a lot of 'slop', in the hope that a flimsy pressed metal spring cap will take up the slack and somehow be secure. It simply doesn't work. The result is a loose mechanical fit which will certainly introduce noise into your system as the contact pins move relative to one another.After years and hundreds of Amazon purchases I am amazed that Amazon would sell this item. It is simply unfit for its intended purpose.Thanks to Amazon Prime's return policy I don't expect any problem returning this. In the final analysis it is Amazon which will sustain the loss, but don't waste your time with this cable. Amazon offers superior cables for a few bucks more."
1,Don't buy it!,Cons: Not very sturdy if you travel with it a lot (it was in my car most of the time). Combination lock broke (failed to open) within 1 month of purchase. Since then I've bought a regular cash box with a key and lock and it has been working fine. I do not suggest combination locks (esp cheap ones) if you plan on moving around with it a lot.Pros: quite spacious with money clips
3,Too many reps of each exercise!,Taebo doesnt have much variety so when you add like 32 or 40 reps for each move the dvd becomes unbearable. It is a good workout but the other taebo dvds are better. Taebo is an exercise where u can go hard or go soft and amp it up yourself.
3,Debbie is out of tune,I saw this concert by TV and I was very dissappointed. Debbie sings out of tune almos all the time !!!!! The only reason why I give this DVD 3 stars is because Blondie is a legend and this is one of the few DVD of this great band.
3,Good Product at a Good Price,"I am pleased with this product. It was easy to assemble, looks pretty good and I thought the cost was quite reasonable."
1,Unmoved,Monotonous and lack luster performances; the words and lyrics do not resonate with an authenticity. A total drag to listen to.
1,can't find,"Wanted small skillet with Louis and Clark . Everyone shows picture of it but no one has it. Ordered small Dutch oven and have same problem , no one has it"
3,She'll Learn....,"She'll Learn is about three best friends sticking together as they go through many trials in life only to come to the conclusion they have to love one self before trying to love someone else. Overall, I liked the story line but didn't like all the cursing."
3,Good Quality but small,"Bought this for my teen son to carry to school. I have bought other packs that didn't last a week. This pack has held up well. My son likes all the pockets and other features. It is smaller than I was expecting. It's 2000 cubic inches. I think it lists that it's 2300 Cubic inches. 5 stars for quality, 2 stars because of the size,....3 1/2 stars overall."
3,Problem with color...,"I ordered the backpack in the Bouquet, Plum shade. My issue is that the picture on the web site is not at all similar in color to the actual shade of the fabric of the backpack. The light blue shade that shows under the purple flowers is actually a reallly bright teal/seagreen shade."
3,Arrived rusted,"This is a great size, and the lid being able to double as a skillet helps keep one pot cooking truly to one pot. The only issue is that this should have arrived pre-seasoned and ready for cooking. Instead, I had to spend a fair amount of time and elbow grease stripping and re-seasoning it because just under the top layer was lots of rust, on both the parts."
4,5qt dutch oven,works great in the hands of a cook! Eat out people... good luck join a fatty farm. Home cooks Godsend
3,"Heats up and cooks really well, except....","For the price, this is a great first dutch oven. However, I've noticed the food all has the same iron taste. It's not bad, but can make dinners boring pretty quickly.PRO: Love the lid for cooking eggs or bacon!"
5,To purchase another brand of cast Iron is not Logical,"This is a great ducth oven. I have used it on the stove in the oven and on my grill. Very Very versatile.Lodge Logic makes such wonderfull cast iron products. ""Frying Pans, Who Knew?""."
5,Fantastic,"We've been avid campers for over 30 years, but never really got into cast iron because of the weight. Now that we have trailers instead of tents, and carrying is easier, we have learned the love of cast iron.We have used this to make a quiche, over briquettes on the grill, and we have also done the slow-cook, bury in the ground method to make chicken with all the fixings. Both came out moist and delicious."
3,it's not *Matrix* but somewhat entertaining,"David Rice is one of those guys who has a troubled childhood. His mother has abandoned him when he was just a wee child. His father is an abusive alcoholic. To make his life worse, he's bullied at school. There's only one bright spot in his life...his crush, Millie.Then, one day, he soon discovers that he can teleport. Upon discovery, he abandons his lonely life and makes a comfortable life for himself. However, there's a secret organization of hitmen that seeks to eliminate jumpers (teleporters) because they believe that only God should have this ability.The ""cat and mouse"" game is interesting. The escape from the Paladin hitmen forces David to seek help from another jumper and Millie, his high school crush, whom he hasn't seen in years.While a fascinating movie, the story isn't quite perfect. There's just too many loose ends, leaving you wonder how did such things start or end. It looks like a sequel is possible. If so, hopefully, we'll get some answers."
3,Jumper,It's kind of fun. But left a lot of questions open. Still fun for sci-fi fans. It needed more character developement.
4,I thought it was good movie,This movie is a time travel movie where the 'jumpers' are being hunted by a government group that has been around for years and years. It was fast movie and overall a great escape movie.
2,"lame, sorry.","i was thoroughly un-impressed with this movie. i am a fan of hayden christensen, but i think he has had his better acting moments. i got about half-way through this movie, then quit from absolute boredom. if you wanna see a really good movie with him in it, watch the thriller 'Awake'. now THAT is a good movie."
1,Makes me actually want to watch a chic flick,"Absolutely horrible movie. Terrible acting. The so-called ""good guy"" is not really a likable person - someone who steals from others, while living a good life by eating breakfast on the Sphinx. Makes you actually want the bad guys to win. Too many plot holes. No character development. Please stay as far away as possible from this movie. Unless you have all the time in the world to waste on mindless activities."
2,Who are the real good guys and bad guys?,"I thought this movie was weak because it had no real moral center. It pits jumpers, who are people who can teleport, but never seem to do anything positive for society, against Paladins, who want to wipe out the jumpers. The main jumper character is typical of why I didn't particularly like jumpers. He robs banks, frames a young rival for his own bank robbery, and never, ever tells his girlfriend the truth. Heroic behavior? Hardly. The main Paladin, played by Samuel Jackson, seemed more like a good guy to me, although his methods were of course way too extreme (no trial, death penalty). So for me, there was lots of great action, a little humor, and no good guys. That detracts from the movie."
2,Missing scenes...heck missing some story,"I caught this film last night on satellite, and here is the short of it:Nice effects, some nice editing, cool visuals...everything else leaves much to be desired. Hayden Christensen is adequate for the role, but not the most gripping and charismatic fellow. Sam Jackson does the best with his material and is his usual intense self while delivering the goods as a baddie. However, the film-makers seem to have been so worried about keeping the pace of the film tight (barely a 90 minute film) that some scenes that may explain stuff further are just missing. Who the hell are the bad guys really? How are jumpers born? The director seems to have wanted to leave some mysteries for the sequel (questionable if there will be one), but there just isn't enough to entice with the first film."
2,Jumper (Good Effects?!),"Package recieved in good condition. Everything in the box was received in its proper place. No complaints on the delivery, package or the condition of either. The low rating was for the movie itself. The movie itself, is kind of weak. Yes, the the thought of being able to ""Jump"", is pretty awesome! The effects, and tools the ""Jumper Cops"" have, are pretty friggin cool too. CGI and special effects have come a long way. Also the Cast is pretty good too. But they take the effects away and the dude is still Anakin who wants everything the easy way. If you are reading this Hayden, props to you for participating, and on your performance; but the plot kind of fell short. Either way the cast was great, and their performances were great. I just think the movie could have been better."
4,Coming of Age and Cojones,This was a really funny and touching book. It tells the story of a teenage Hispanic/American preppy kid as he battles personal demons on the way to discovering his heritage and manhood. I laughed and almost cried in parts. I look at the author's picture and bio and wonder how much of this is really fiction.
1,unexpectedly fragile,"In spite of this chip's seemingly hefty rubber coating, the rubber is very flexible and the little circuit board inside is not. I bent this very slightly while attempting to insert it into a socket surrounded by cables and it snapped readily. This is fragile; avoid it."
5,I am unbelievably excited for this...,"I grew up watching these movies with my Grandparents and my cousins! My ALLTIME favorite Doris movie is Romance on the High Seas! I was so excited when they said it was gonna be released I bought 2 copies and now my grandpa is purchasing this box set! I'm in love - I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love.... ;)"
2,"Missing ""Romance on the High Seas""","My wife grew up watching these movies with her Grandmother. I purchased this DVD set for her, particularly for ""Romance on the High Seas"". Wouldn't you know it? Inside the DVD case was one of the other movies. We've watched all of them, and we definitely have two of the same disc. Just thought I'd come back and add that ""caveat emptor""."
5,DORIS DAY collection,This set is missing two very important Doris Day movies:STARLIFT and IT'S A GREAT FEELING
3,Janie's Last Hope,"What Janie Found is the last book about Janie Johnson. It looks as though the Springs and the Johnsons have been able to come up with a good compromise. Janie is even talking to Reeve again. However, things start to get bad again when Frank Johnson has a stroke and a heart attack. Mrs. Johnson is having a hard time coping with her husband's health problems and so Janie is taking care of most of the finances and so forth. Butt when Janie learns one more secret about her kidnapping, will she try to find and meet her kidnaper? Or will she stay away from the past and try to mend things between two broken families?"
2,A Better Ending PLEASE ~ By: Chloe and Susan,"We loved reading about Janie/Jenny in the first three books, but we didn't like the fourth one because of the simple ending. We were disappointed! We still don't know the answers to several questions, such as ""Who is the real Hannah?"" and ""How did Hannah finally leave the cult?"" Although Ms. Cooney wrote a realistic ending, we think it should have been more dramatic."
3,An End to it All,"Pale as baby powder, Janie's face twisted and turned with massive confusion. Both Reve and Brian saw her wear this expression as she looked at a file in the cabinet in the Johnson's house. Her father was very sick and was now in the hospital, leaving all the taxes to Miranda Johnson. Mrs.Johnson was too depressed, and thought she could not take on a duty such as this, so she let Janie take over. Looking through the filing cabinets Janie discovered a deep dark secret her ""Daddy"" had...........and it led her to her kidnapper.Discover what Janie finds and how she and her family puts an end to this tragic event in their lives by reading, a wonderfully written novel, ""What Janie Found""."
3,Depressing Read,"This book was so sad it made me want to cry! If you are too happy than this book is great, but if you aren't don't pick it up! Janie Johnson now Jennie Spring has now solved the mystery of her kiddnapping, and is now living with her real family the Springs. She hates it! They are so different! And Janie acts like such a bratt! The pore family! They have to deal with janies unkindness and her sadness as she misses the Johsons. Or should I say javensons. I rated this a three, because it wasn't a great book and was very sad, and because it wasn't horrible!"
2,Sparkl1590,"I really didn't like this book at all. After reading everything elsethat happened to Janie in the previous books, this was nothing. Theretruly wasn't a purpose for writing it. It really doesn't give you any more information about her saga than the past three books did. However, the book was easy to read and now that I finally know what happened to Janie I'll sleep easier, just kiddin'."
3,A Disappoinment,"I read the book and personally thought that it was the worst of the four books in the series. I liked the first two a lot and ""The Voice on The Radio"" really kept me pulled in. However, when I read ""What Janie Found"" it didn't pull me in like the other books. The book didn't come to a climax and the whole point of the book never came out. If I were Janie in her situation I would have wanted to see Hannah. I was really disappointed in this book. Caroline Cooney is an excellent writer and I know that she will produce more exciting novels."
2,UM..............,"I'm sorry but this book was VERY disppointed. I read all the other Janie books and would have rated them 4 or 5 stars but this one was horrible. It was boring and any suspense that Caroline B. Cooney did put into it led to apsolutely NOTHING!If you have read all the other Janie books and want to read the conclusion book, go right ahead. But I'm warning you, it's not all that great."
5,Hopalong Cassidy Really Neat!!,I received Hopalong Cassidy vol 6 in record time!! The product was in excellent condition and I enjoyed watching the films.I highly recommend this item.
1,Don't waste your money,Their website claims that you will experience immediate results. I used it for 30 days and experienced no difference in my erections. This is just another product making claims it can't back up...don't waste your money.
5,A Very Brady Christmas,This was the best of all the televsion films that followed the original television series. It's the one most on my wish list for a DVD release between now and whever the television show box sets are finished coming out.
4,Enjoyable!,"Ok It's kind of cheesy but I have fun watching it and being a Brady fan I wouldn't mind having this in my Christmas video collection but I really hope they put it on DVD! This was a cute story, the only drawback is that a different girl played Cindy as Susan Olsen was busy and couldn't be in the movie but other than that it was pretty good and the girl who played Cindy though not as good as Susan Olsen was ok as her, I also would have liked Alan Melvin the original Sam to have reprised his roll and had a bigger role than his replacement had but it was still great to see the rest of the original actors!"
5,"Bought 5, great product",One is next to my kitchen sink and one is in my shower. It fits perfectly on the wall soap holder and keeps my home made soaps from sliding all over the place or sitting in water and ruining. One of the soap dishes I received was bent a little but it's been a few days and is flattening out just fine.
1,NOT Tripp Lite P502-010 SVGA Monitor Gold Cable w RGB Coax HD15M/M - 10ft,The product shipped did not appear to a Tripp Lite cable. Some of the pins were unconnected. It also did not support 1920x1080 resolution like my 4-foot and 6-foot VGA cables do.
2,Not as pictured,"missing a ferrite on both sides as pictured. While it does show pin 9 missing in the picture, I wish I had also seen that. 2 stars is for receiving an item falsely advertised."
2,On The Day You Were Born,I'd heard good reviews about this book but wasn't impressed. I would recommend The Night You Were Born over this book.
5,One of life's greatest moments.,"This loving memory of the beginning of life is an instant heirloom. I read the book to Elizabeth, my first grandchild, when she was fifteen hours old. Tiny, with little hands clinched and eyes screwed shut, she and I laughed and cried thru the outstanding prose. We loved the pictures, so fanciful, clever and clear. Now we read the book together, and she asks me, ""Were you really there Pappie?"" and I proudly reply ""You bet, Elizabeth, It was the greatest moment of my life!"" If your looking for a memory, buy this book and read it to a kid. The rewards are immediate."
3,pocket size needs work,"good kit except for the pocket sizes. There are too many small pockets which are next to useless. CLC need to make all the little ones about twice as big. Half as many, twice the size would be more useful. All in all the trays inside are good for holding screws & wire nuts etc."
2,Disney pricing,"I remember Bill Nye being very good and he probably still is, but $49 for a 20 minute DVD is absurd. The folks at Disney need to get a handle on their egos. I can get a 12 hour lecture series from the Teaching Company for $69. I love Amazon, but this product is ridiclously over-priced."
3,Macrobiotic Way,"This book was purchased as a gift. I don't know much about the book, but the recepent requested it. The service from Amazon wasgood, as usual."
5,Splendid Recording,"Sammartini was an extremely influential composer who helped bridge the gap from baroque to classical. These charming selections, exquisitely performed, are a pure delight and illustrate his lyrical compositions and rhythmic freedom which influenced composers like Haydn and Mozart.Highly recommended."
2,"Fantastic singing by Christoff, appalling package by EMI.","""As important to Christoff as the music was the text"" so says Alan Blyth in the booklet to this 5CD set.A shame then it was not so important to EMI France. Are we to assume that the original releases in 1963 and 1969 lacked texts, translations and decent notes? Well perhaps that was possible then, but that doesn't mean that today a major record company should be able to get away with 3 pages each of French, English and German notes and a listing of song titles in French only.It isn't as if EMI France can't do it, because they already did for Christoff's 3CD Mussorgsky set - even providing the Russian texts in Cyrillic, something still rare despite the example of Philips' Kirov sets.No doubt diehard Christoff fans will put up with EMI France for the sake of the music, but if you are just browsing then search for the Mussorgsky set on Amazon and you will soon be the happy owner of one of Gramophone Magazine's top 100 recordings of all time."
5,Just Great!,"I learned how to play chess at the age of 11 with these books and I UNDERSTOOD chess immediatelly. Now, many many years later, I am byuing these again and I am eager to teach my growing daughter how to play ... she is only 2 now, but I noticed that the nice illustrations have already captivated her!!! She knows the pieces already and we are moving on to how they move :-)"
4,Lips Service,I found this lip balm refreshing! It gave my lips a little tingle and made them feel soft and hydrated. I would recommend this product.
2,I thought this book was okay,This book was about a girl who goes to a festival to have a good time and ends up getting more than she bargained for. With her cousin and new friend she helps solves this murder and free's an innocent man.
1,Amateurish.,"I enjoyed She Walks These Hills and was shocked to discover that this book was written by the same author. The plot was silly, the mystery was uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional. It read like a draft for a course ""Learning to Write Mystery Stories"". Ms. McCrum should have kept this one in her botton drawer."
3,A good read,Highland Laddie Gone by Sharyn Mc Crumb. This is the second Elizabeth MacPherson novel that I have read and once again I love the setting; North Carolina and Virginia. Elizabeth is persuaded to be the Maid of the Cat for the Highland Western Virginia Scottish Festival being held at Glencoe Mountain. There is a lot of anger at the Campbell clan and soon the leader of the Campbells is found dead. It is up to Elizabeth to find the killer before someone else dies.
2,A lazy effort,The grim realisation that the last 20 years would be given very superficial treatment dawns when you are several hundred pages in and it's still the early 80's. Very disappointing as Elton had a very popular and successful period during the mid-80's and several top albums and great tours were glossed over. The last 10 years fairs even worse - it appears a superficial update to cash in on EJ's Knighthood status. Even the well publicised friendship with the Princess of Wales is hardly touched. Pity 'cause I enjoyed particularly the coverage of the 70's ...
1,GARBAGE: NOT UL LISTED!!!!!,"This thing overheated before I even had a chance to turn it on to use it! It got VERY warm the minute I plugged it in, and when I did try to use it, it literally worked for a short burst and shut down, and even the next day it wouldn't turn back on. It smelled like melting plastic and I was waiting for this thing to spark up and catch fire. This appliance is NOT UL listed, and while it is made up to look like it is, it does not work properly. Beware if you buy this one, go spend an extra ten bucks and get a brand you're familiar with. I don't be getting an off-brand appliance again!"
4,Classic piece in numerical analysis.,"This is a classic piece in numerical analysis.The book is normally very hard to get hand on.The sections on discretization schemes andODEs are excellent.Not an in-depth book but an overview book.Does not cover late developments.Dahlquist has made significant and wellknown contributions to ODE solver theory.The origin is the department for numerical analysisat the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm,Sweden ...A second edition is reportedly under way."
3,Dissapointed,"I was very excited to purchase something so cheap I could use for my phone and camera to make my life easier.However, when I received the product I was hesitant. The package mentioned there was a 1 GB limit on it, and I have a 4 and an 8 gig card. I tried it and it didn't work with my SD cards. I ended up contacting the seller and am now receiving a refund.I am giving this 3 stars because if you just have 1 GB cards it's perfect, shipping was fast, and good customer service."
5,Great Pocket Light,"I've had the Gerber Tempo for over two years, during which time it has been in my pocket, on my key chain. I love it. It's handy, easy to operate, and bright. The big selling point for me was that it uses a AAA battery: easily found, cheaply replaced. The gray coating has come off on all the edges and along the barrel, and some see that as a negative. But for me, it just makes it look more rugged. I don't need my key chain to be pretty, just functional. I would recommend this to anyone, and plan on getting a couple more.I cannot speak to its weather proofing, though. One of the other reviews commented that the light has to be twisted on for the seal to be in place, and that does appear to be so. I can't see why it was designed that way, since it doesn't make much sense. But since my pockets don't get wet, it hasn't ever been a problem."
5,Beautiful Cake Pops.,I use a small amount to thin candy melts for my cake pops. I could not make them without it.
2,Not as good as expected,"I used these as an additive to my melted chocolate that I was using to cover cake pops and cake bites. Before, I was just using oil to do the job, which was very successful. Many different resources said that I needed to try these paramount crystals to help the chocolate hold to the cake pops. My attempt with these paramount crystals was a near disaster... Several of the pops started to sweat through the chocolate and on others the chocolate cracked, both of which had never happened on the hundreds of cake pops/bites that I had made with oil in the chocolate. Needless to say, I switched back to oil."
2,paramount crystals,I make and sell plenty of cake pops and am constantly working with chocolate. I must say that I would much rather use Crisco. The Paramount Crystals tend to leave little lumps in the chocolate.
5,What a great gift!,What a great gift! I just received all four books in the Dragon Quartet for my birthday and couldn't put them down until I had completed the series. The first chapter of each book is online. Do yourself - or your friend - a favor and get all 4 books.
3,It was returned since the info the seller gave didn't tell the full story and it couldn't work for me so it was returned,If the seller had mentioned that it needs to be used below water level I never would have bought it. I didn't learn that till I opened the box. Then I couldn't use it and had to send it back
1,A pretty useless book,"If you are a student of quantum mechanics (for the first time) you will learn nothing from this book. It does not contain anything of practical value. If you are interested in philosophy, or an amateur of science, this book is for you. If you are an experienced physicist, this book is pretty useless. How can one talk about histories without using the path integral? You are better off reading Feynman, Kleinert, Thirring and other authors who do understand quantum field theory deeply."
5,Fair Tax,This book is a good review of out current federal tax problem and presents a well researched solution.
2,"More shock, less substance","Having been a huge fan of CSI (Las Vegas only) I have been sorely disappointed with season 9. We have all the seasons on DVD (cable not available and don't want a dish) and recently began watching this season. My dismay is not so much with the loss of characters but the increased shock value and gory-ness of the current season. Previous seasons focused more on ""solving the puzzle"" of the crime while this season seems to focus more on the portrayal of the crime (shock value.) The recent episode I watched had a whole sequence at the beginning where a woman was hunted down and strangled (took 1 -2 minutes.) Sorry, I just couldn't watch. The characters haven't really melded yet either which makes for awkward dialogue. Have put it aside for now, may come back to it later.....very disappointed. I guess it was to be expected, most shows don't have a run for this long without the edges starting to fray...."
2,Not new discs,These discs were obviously not new. The case was broken and many of the discs would not play the full episodes.
2,Ray Langston's Back Story Not Believable,"Let me start by saying Laurence Fishburn is a wonderful actor. However, his character's back story is simply not believable. Why would a doctor and a college professor whom one would assume is making a good living, leave to take an entry level CSI job? It just doesn't make sense. Then all the other characters are asking his opinion on things; e.g. ""Ray, what do you think of this?,"" Ray, come take a look at this."" I find it simply not believable. Rather than attempting to replace a Grissom type character, I would have made Catherine a stronger leader and hired Demore Barnes formerly Hector Williams on the Unit to replace Gary Dourdain's character. I think Mr. Barnes would have been a much better addition to the cast."
4,Another great season.,"This season introduces Dr. Raymond Langston, played by Laurence Fishburne. Another season of good CSI stories. Fishburne does an excellent job and fits into his role like a glove."
3,Lovely pagan novel,"Meant for teens but this old lady read it and enjoyed it. And the day to day pagan aspects are blended in the story well and very realistic. But then Silver is a bit of an expert on her path of paganism. And she always writes with integrity, clarity, simplicity and honesty."
3,Husks go everywhere!,"These work well for the finches, but not for me. My finches really enjoyed these but oh those husks, they flew everywhere! Since I have 12 finches, it's important for me to find ways to reduce the flinging of the husks and this is not what I want to use. My millet now sits in a fairly shallow tupperware bowl and works fine. Perhaps for others this will work, but not for me."
3,needs a different title,"I was a little disappointed by this one. The photos are often not sharp enough to really bring out details. Also, most of the Americal colonial and early 19th c. details pictured are in New York so you get a good look at styles from the region, but not a broad overview. My biggest complaint though is that so much space is devoted to reproduction or historic-inspired details rather than the real thing.If you're looking for an idea book for adding historic-inspired touches to a home, this is a good choice. As a source for restoration, I think it falls short"
5,Works thus far!,"I bought this for an aquarium that's exactly 30 gallons. I followed the set up instructions and I'm very glad I did because the seal from the motor to the water reservoir wasn't in its track. So, I fixed it easily and then it worked out just fine. ;)I will put an update if anything changes - I am satisfied."
5,The pyramids of The Ancient Egypt,"It's the definitive book on the subject.Great text,clear illustrations."
4,"Fun, And Definitely Worth A Shot","The story is about about a woman(Trinh) who hires several mercenaries to help complete a series of tasks to save her kidnapped daughter. This movie is in subtitles and runs an hour forty minutes. This movie was very fun, and enjoyable to watch. The movie uses a story line that has been used to death in other movies. This story line being that the main character(This time the character being Trinh) falls for another character and realizes something about him that makes her feelings for him complicated and forces her to take drastic action. But in saying that, the movie was still really good. The fight scenes are very well done, the acting is top notch and the pace of the movie is smooth with very, very few bumps. The movie was fun, and definitely worth a shot."
2,I don't like it,"I don't feel like it helps at all. I've been using it for about a month with no results. Also, the label lies, because the ingredients are FAR from all-natural. It contains methylparaben and sodium lauryl sulfate, both of which are horrible for your skin and hair and have highly detrimental side-effects.I would definitely NOT recommend this."
5,Shampoo Cre-C really works,"My boyfriend has used Shampoo Cre-C for about 3 weeks now and am able to see the difference in his hair. Previously his hair had started thinning and hair line was fading also. But now the hair has gotten thicker, the hair line has started to grow and the hair looks healthier. He is definetly planning on buying this product over and over again.Shampoo Cre-C really works!!!He is extremely satisfied!"
3,"Did not see any difference, maybe I did not used it long enough?","My sister saw results with this shampoo, I didnt. Very expensive and the bottle has enough shampoo for a few washes."
3,It's okay.,"I got this tape for $1 at my local dollar store, and I'm glad I didn't pay more. I would say it's not worth much more than five.The good points are that it's colorful, and the animation and songs are pretty decent. But the instructor often spends way too much time talking about the poses, rather than just getting into them. It's too long for kids to wait. Also, I find the instructor's voice very.....odd. I know it's supposed to be 'soothing', but I find it weird. It's rather deep. It sounds to me like a man's voice trying to be a woman's voice. (If you've ever seen Transamerica, you'll know what I mean.)I don't think my kids will use this as it's intended, as it's pretty slow. I know yoga isn't about speed, but kids aren't generally about meditation and excessive patience. If it went more directly into getting the kids into the poses, it would be better, in my opinion."
3,Burned out in 2 months...,"It worked great for 2 months and then out of nowhere, burned out.I hardly move this light and only when it's off and cooled down. I would have expected this bulb to last longer than 2 months...especially for the price I paid for it."
4,Decent,"The Ro-Kira interaction was enjoyable. Same goes for the Sisko-Quark scenes. The story was just interesting enough to keep reading, but it was only mildly entertaining. It was informative on the Bajoran provisional government. It included alien species that we've encountered on previous missions."
1,Unbelievable!,"I can scarcely believe that this book is even listed on Amazon. Set in wartime Manchester, England, it's the story of a group of girls who begin a nurse's training course at a big, public hospital. The premise itself is ok but the writing is so basic that it was as if the writer was talking to not too bright children, or to slightly retarded readers. She all but spells out, in short sentences, the meaning of everything she says...I simply couldn't continue beyond a couple of chapters. I don't like to appear superior, but the author seems to think that we're all dim-wits!"
4,Very good perspective...,"Although it is difficult to find anyone that someone can entirely agree with on every point, I definitely learned a lot from this book. As it has been mentioned, Hays is a pacifist in some of his writing, but I purchased this book for one section specifically. He brings up some very interesting points and perspectives different from mainstream Christianity, and I most DEFINITELY learned a lot from this, and God spoke to me through it.Read the book; you'll enjoy it! If you read something along the way that you aren't sure about when you read it, then ask your pastor about it, and you'll both grow from the experience."
3,good but not great,"the pari-dakar is better covered by speed tv, when it happens...although that could be because it doesnt focus only on one team. but on the flipside, it does give one a better opportunity to see the behind-the-scenes moments, and how truly grueling a race this is"
2,Poor little butterfly!,"The butterfly was larger than I expected. Mine didn't come with a chain, but perhaps it wasn't supposed to. The piece felt hollow. I would call it molded rather than crafted. Diamond chips were barely visible. Sorry, but it was cheap looking. I would never give as a gift. This company has been great with returns (plus their gift boxes are very nice), so I know there will be no problem returning."
2,Hmm..,"I don't agree with most of the author's viewpoints. When I bought this book, I thought it would be a good book on the mythology of the Germanic people. The author in turn distorts much of the information from the Eddas and Sagas, and if someone were to only read her book and not the original sources they would believe only her point of view. She morphs the goddessess into one triple aspect goddess, which is kind of annoying. Wasn't completely useless, but close."
5,Educational and Informative,"In addition to being well-written, the book was also very enlightening and informative. While some may view the material as controversial; I believe that the author was highly successful in delivering her points and was able to shed light on a topic that needed just that."
3,Blues or Soul,The Memphis Tri-State Blues FestivalThere is an obvious relationship between the blues and soul music. However the title of this DVD suggests that the Memphis event involves the Blues. Viewing and listening suggests that the music featured is mostly soul. The music is generally well done it's just not the blues music that I was anticipating. I should have paid more attention to the artists presented on the DVD. If I had then perhaps I would not have moved forward with the purchase. If live soul music is your thing then this DVD is certainly worth a listen.
3,INCREDIBly dissapointed,"We purchased all of the figures for my daughter for Christmas. Within 2 weeks of her receiving this one, the pin fell out of her leg and her leg fell off. We replaced it with a new one and the pin on the leg of that one fell off within a month. The head does not stay on invisible violet, Syndrome broke in half, Violet's pin fell out of her arm, and Mr. Incredible lost the pin in his leg. My daughter does not play rough with her toys. Just normal play and they fell apart. Also, Helen is supposed to be Elasta girl. Why didn't they make her stretch? Didn't make sense to me."
5,Great introduction to making Hemps!,"I have to say that I love this book! I'll admit that it did not come with enough beads or hemp, but you can buy those cheaply at any craft store!! This book has so many patterns to try, and gives the simplest directions! I would definately reccomend this book to people, because it is fun and easy. *I would reccomend it for kids 9 and up*"
2,"Only book, not beads","I was upset upon arrival of the item. The description clearly states there should have been beads the the book and there were no beads. I want some money back, since the main reason I bought this book was to get the beads as well."
1,Let the buyer beware,"First off, you should know this is a cd-r. Some people may not care but I was a bit upset I paid cd prices for something anyone could burn. Second, if you're buying this for the Dixie Chicks, you may want to think again. This cd only contains one song by the Chicks and it's an old style pre-Natalie tune- great if you're a fan of the older Chicks but not so much if you tuned in to the girls' music only after Natalie joined the band.Overall, the music was fun, really great for younger kids but not much appeal beyond that."
2,Disappointed............ again!,I don't understand this release. Fans waited forever for a live DVD and then we got an acoustic show........ we have continued to wait for a live cd and we get the entire Lucky release live.Getting past the fact that this is a nice show - what does Melissa have against a standard live - greates hits type of cd and DVD....... ot the music that made her?To finally release a live cd/dvd and have it only be about music from her latest release is a huge disappointment!rob
5,Boxing's Best: Rocky Marciano,"This video is a must for Marciano fans. Included, in addition to highlights of his classic fights, is rare footage of seldom-seen bouts against Harry Matthews, Rex Layne, and Lee Savold. Rocky is also revealed in several interesting interviews, clips, and plenty of photos."
5,He was great,"Ok, for all of you people claiming he only fought old boxers, you are wrong. Ok, he had three fights that people critisize him for: Joe Louis, Walcott and Moore. He had to fight Louis because both were looking at a title shot. Marciano almost refused to fight him, as Louis was Marciano's mentor. Walcott was obvious. You can't do much without beating the champion, and Moore campaigned for the Marciano bout. All fighters beat older boxers. Ali fought Archie Moore...he was 19 years younger than him. Ali was 10 years younger than Liston. All fighters have to figt older fighters, otherwise they would seperate weight class as well as age. marciano had incredible punching power, heart and stamina. For those of you who claim he isnt good, you know little about boxing. This video was great, truly showing off Marciano's incredible punching power. Truly, a quality movie if you are a Marciano fan."
1,another boring dvd release by the wwe,this dvd is not worth buying its boring dull and yes annoying and it makes my ears bleed the wwe is going nowhere since it has since gone down the pg rated era when it was the wwf and it was the attitude era the wwf had its run and now its all about familys and kids show its no longer a real wrestling business its now pg rated crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,WAY OVERRATED,"After 3 listens I must say I am 100% underwhelmed. First of all, I thought there would be at least a little originality and creativity in there, but no...none of this is anything I haven't heard before. At all. It's all recycled melodies and chord progressions for the most part. Secondly, the guy's voice is really annoying (what a wuss!!), a la Belle and Sebastian (in fact a few of the songs sound a little like B&S songs). Really, this album did NOT excite me in the least and I don't understand what all the hubbub was about. I'm really not trying to be just a contrary jerk, but Jesus Christ I can't believe all the praise this album got. The only thing even slightly interesting is the instrumentation, and truthfully it's not even that interesting to me. My advice, skip it. Maybe try their first one, which I hear is better (but I've never heard it)."
2,Nice catchy songs....if you get by the.....,"Yes, this band can write some great sounding songs. You just have to get by Colin Meloy's idiotic singing style first. I can't write how annoying it is to listen to him. Either he's trying to be different or is just that stupified in the studio."
1,So effin' precious I can't stand it,"The Decemberists make Belle & Sebastian sound heavy metal. They exist solely so guys who get their asses kicked in high school can know that there are other guys in the universe whose asses they themselves could probably kick. Dreadful. Go ahead and press the ""No this review wasn't helpful to me"" button, but you know I'm right, don't you, spotty?"
3,A Lot of Hype,"I'll preface my review by saying that I have yet to jump on the Decemberists' bandwagon. Although I enjoyed Castaways and Cutouts, I was hardly washed away like many people seem to have been. It was a bit of a disappointment, as I have always been a huge Neutral Milk Hotel Fan and was excited to hear about a band cracked up to be so similar. Perhaps then, I was the victim of my own expectations. Anyway, this album doesn't even match up with their debut. As in the debut, the lyrics are very interesting (definitely the strongpoint of both albums), but the music itself just doesn't seem inviting enough. The whole album borders on being catchy, but it never quite hooked me. Its certainly worth a listen though, and I'm sure that the Decemberists will eventually release a stunning album. Just not yet."
3,Frustration,"I ordered this nook dining set for my daughter for her eat in kitchen area. Without the expertise and competency of my husband, a person with average or below average skills in assembly would never get this product together. It also takes two people to do the assembly.In addition, the table piece came damaged. It took some doing to get Amazon to admit that we purchased this item through them and not Target, a retail partner of Amazon. Once we got over that hurdle we then had to argue with Amazon to agree to pay for shipping the damaged table back to them, of course the table was the last of the four packages we opened when we were doing the assembly.Now, here comes the WOW factor. Once Amazon receives the damaged table they will credit our account for the full amount of the dining set and we will need to reorder the entire set, consequently, we will have another complete dining set of which we will only need the table."
4,Lotsa fun...,"David vs Goliath-type films are always fun. Multiple Oscar contenders are on hand to give great voice to some very good characters. The totally CGI film is wonderful to watch and experience, and is a great family film. Robin Williams is kept in control, as necessary, and Ewan McGregor and Halle Berry carry the lead roles well, and Jim Broadnent should be given credit for the nastiest of nasty persons, with fine support from Greg Kinnear. Expect the non-human jokes, which are all clever. Mel Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Amanda Bynes and Drew Carey add to the fun. I won't blab away the plot, but this is fun and worth a look."
2,Kind of Dreadful,This is not as good as it looks the commercials are way better then the actual movie even though I like Halle Berry a lot I still will not ever see this movie again unless I absolutely have to so I wouldn't waste the money on renting it or buying or would I waste and hour and a half watching this the only good part is when one of the robots breakdance to Baby One More Time I laughed but nobody else did funny because usually it would be the oppoisite. My grade over all (F) Robots is rated PG For Mild Language and Some Suggestive Content.
5,Watch it or ill rip out your entrails and make you eat them!!,"that was am empty threat, but never the less youo should see this movie, it is, to qoute my best friend, ""FREAKIN SWEAT!!"" Im 15, and the animated CGI blah blah blah genre usually doesnt appeal to me but this movie is by far the best one of its kind ive ever seen, i loved it. With McGreggor and Robin Williams in it i coulndt turn away so i went and saw it, i loved it so much that i saw it 3 more times!! and i still wanted to see it again. It mocks brittany Spears, Big Buissness, and well everything else, what more could you want? Its the best ive ever seen..."
1,Odd,"While the animation and visual concepts for this filmare wonderful, I must say that I am very disappointedin the type of humor involved.Bathroom humor and sexual jokes are simply not appropriatefor children.The plot is too simple for adults, so I must assume thatthe target audience of this movie is children - not good."
4,Movie for the whole family,"This is a great movie with all the elements for good family fun. There is humor for the adults and children alike. Compared to a lot of other animated films that are appealing to adults (i.e. Shrek, Shark Tale), this is still a children's film and doesn't contain a lot of humor that's over the heads of its audience. All three generations of our family have enjoyed this film together."
3,Could use some oil,"It started off promising, but after the first 15 minutes it started to drag. I really enjoyed the last five minutes too. The animation was incredible, as it usually is with these films. But as far as the story goes, not quite as amazing. It's still worth seeing, but I think kids will enjoy it the most. There is some adult humor in it too."
3,Family Fun,"This is a fun movie. It's not going to go down in history as a classic, but it's got a great cast doing voices and a lot of one-liner laughs that the whole family can enjoy."
4,Great Family Movie,"I don't generally enjoy cartoon movies but my entire family ages 27, 8, 6, 1 1/2 , all enjoyed this movie so much. We all laughed through the entire thing. It is rare for all of us to agree on a movie and this one did it."
2,okay,"this movie is okay, but I would not really recomend it for young children. there are a few messages that young children might not understand."
3,Don't waste your money,"I couldn't wait for this movie too be released on DVD. I went out and bought it the first day. I was so disapointed. If you really want to see it, rent it."
3,Too much British English,"I've used the dictionary a lot and while it is very thorough, the English is often British in spite of what it says on the jacket.Many of the English translations leave Americans baffled."
4,Awesome Book!,"This is an awesome book! It spans a 100 year time frame and does a good job of mixing in relevant pieces of real history. If the main character in this book (Rose Dunmore) is not someone in the authors family than she has an incredibly creative mind. I really enjoyed the spiritual Bible references and the good ole' fashioned down-home common sense that Rosa dished out in abundance. The authentic language was also a nice touch. Bravo, I throughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it for a book club read! -ES"
5,love skullcandy!,I love these headphones..My friends all wish they could steal them but I won't let them. The sound is great and they look totally awesome!
4,roxy saint is a rising superstar and revolutionary!,"when i watched this dvd, i was really impressed with her honesty and the way she brought everything home, making everything real, in such a surreal way. this was some of the best and most interesting filmmaking i have seen in years! it was really fresh and fun in a dark and depraved way. i definitely think roxy saint is the answer to her own question, ""where are the superstars now?"" think marilyn manson meets courtney love, with a pinch of fiona apple and poe. the first half of the dvd, and particularly the song rebel, is so hard core!"
4,why? WHY?,"What did Japan do that was so special to get all these exclusive albums and EP's? I know the record companies hate making money and hate music fans, but seriously, there's people in the rest of the world that would love to own this if it was regularly priced."
4,Pretty good...,"This case is rather large, it fits everything I throw at it and still has room to spare. The front panel looks metal but it's not, it's plastic and my friend when helping me install the motherboard broke the top panel off. It really can't take any weight, so careful with that. My only real gripe about the case is with the HDD trays. You screw in your hard drives to little rails and slide them into the case, but they don't sit very securely while inside. Currently I have a HDD that's at a 15 degree tilt because of the poor design of it all.The thing has a lot of locations for fans, which is great. It looks stunning and it's easy to install everything. Again, it's very large... it can fit most anything. The case itself is aluminum, it's just too bad the front panel isn't as well. I guess I can super-glue the thing back on. :)"
5,they've done it again!,"this is another really great pennywise album! Their last album ""land of the free?"" was really good, but I think this one has the edge! Fast, melodic, good thought provoking lyrics....typical pennywise! a great one for any punk fan"
4,Typical Pennywise album.,"This album is very typical of Pennywise - meaning it's good, but its pretty much the same exact sound they've always had. Not that it's a bad sound, its quite good, and this is definately a breath of fresh air in a current sea of wimpy emo bands crowding the punk scene. It would just be nice for them to try something different for once."
3,not real sure yet,"I just got this album today and I listened to it once. So far I'd say it's not a bad album, but it's not that great either. It's really nothing they havn't done before. It's still the same old 3 chord punk music they've been playing for years, and the lyrics really aren't that different from Land of the Free. Sometimes it takes a couple listens to really get the feel of a cd, so it might grow on me, and it probably will because I like Pennywise a lot. If you're a fan of Pennywise this album is worth picking up, if you're not really that into them you probably won't like this album. I'll listen to this cd a few more times and post my final thoughts in a week or two..so far, 3 stars."
2,It's alright but...,"Pennywise seems to be turning into another Simple Plan or New Found Glory. What happened to the Pennywise that made you want to shake your fist in the air and sing along while getting pushed around by a bunch of sweaty people with blood stains on their shirts? They won't get a good response if they play this in concert, so they'll probably just play their olther stuff, anyway. The bottom line is: You'll probably like this if you like Simple Plan or boring music like that. But I reccomend you steer clear of From The Ashes and get one of Pennywise's other CDs."
5,Masterful Storyteller,"Great storytelling. Walker is a masterful listener, of both the land and the people who are shaped by the land. She makes a passionate case for wilderness, and for the value of solo traveling."
3,Eileen,It's OK. I was not expecting the white plastic spray part. I thought the whole product would be chrome. I should have looked more colsely.
1,Skip it! See the 1962 version,"Everyone tried to hard too make these characters ""real"" and ended up with a bland Harold Hill, a nasty shrill Marian, a true politician for Mayor Shinn, a Mrs. Shinn with bad timing, and basically an unexciting movie. See the Robert Preston/Shirley Jones version for true fun and appreciation of Meredith Willson's work."
2,"Okay, but...","Decent up to a point. In discussing ""The Hero Within,"" when the subject of autism arises, this author calls autism a disease which it most emphatically is NOT. Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory input and processing and communication to varying degrees based on the individual. I also didn't like the R*** M** reference because the title character Dustin Hoffman played in that 1988 movie is not representative of people who have autism. Less than 10% of the autistic population are prodigious savants and the very term R*** M** is extremely offensive in autism circles and is always best avoided. I for one am quite sick and tired of that savant stereotype being so readily applied to people with autism.All in all, this is a decent book that serves its intended purpose of providing synopses of movies that are suitable for family viewing, but that inaccurate definition of autism and the quick rush to the crutch of R*** M** cost it one star."
1,utter revoltion....,"Horrible.... just utterly bland dry horrible crap.God this book sucked.I suppose i should give it some credit- the first half is pretty good.... But god, does she ruin it with the rest. It builds you up with a decent story, and then just sucks, sucky, suck, sucks."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this for my toddlers thinking it would be an easy way to help them start on their pre school curriculum. Yeah, the whole set of DVDs are basically a power point presentation burned onto a DVD with horrible graphics... My kids hated these DVDs, they would never let me play them for more than 5 minutes."
3,SANDSQUATCH ATE MY GRANDFATHER,"The movie opens in 1956 as 3 men are killed and ripped open by Sandsquatch, a new creature whose name pretty much describes it. Frank is obsessed with finding the creature and spends 50 years in the dessert looking for it, until finally it kills him. His granddaughter (Hilary Schwartz) gathers a group of 4 heavily armed individuals to locate grandpa and to kill Sandsquatch. Meanwhile 4 anarchist friends decide to grab a gorilla costume to scare the 4 armed individuals.The acting and script was better than most low budgets horror films that I have viewed, but it still has a long way to go. The title track sounds like an off-key individual singing karaoke to Trent Razor. It was very bad.F-bomb, sex, nudity (thank you Amanda Ward). 3 stars for the effort and coined name."
1,Unfinished and not that good to start with,"I remember this book when it was a monthly comic and it looked interesting. I snatched it up when the collection was printed but was sorely disappointed.The story is unfinished. Worse than that, the book is padded with pages and pages of the author complaining about the publisher.The story itself, about a race of gods interacting with humans is not even that interesting, certainly not as good as the creator seems to think it is in his pages and pages of complaints."
5,Memories From My Childhood,"This was one of my favorites when I was growing up, and it was great to have the entire series on one DVD. If you are a super hero fan, and love the classics, then this is a must have."
2,I guess,"The novel seemed slightly exaggerated on Toni's part and William's parts were flat out boring. It was an alright novel, but nothing special. I think the show is better. This was just an extension of an episode."
5,Great Price for the style,"I brought this item for my husband, at first he was not sure the style but then we saw it on a tv show. He loves the ability to open bottles white fishing. Now all his friends want a pair. He owned the gel reefs before and says the comfort is the same. Happy from Miami."
5,reef sandals,have several pairs of reefs-love them-when pair wears out & its takes alot of wearing always buy new pair-husband loves them too
5,Comfortable,This by far my son says is the most comfortable sandal ever and has had several pairs for about 2 years now and when these wear out we will be getting some more.
2,I found these uncomfortable,"I have a different model of Reef sandals that are very good and extremely comfortable, but these are not. I don't know if the strap is different material, or if it has been sewn differently, but wearing these gave me blisters and rubbed holes in the tops of my feet around the toes. I am not able to put my finger on exactly why, maybe because they were new, but in five days of wearing these on vacation, I never felt comfortable, and was often conscious of the discomfort. I try to be optimistic, maybe I got lemons, or maybe Reef missed on this particular design."
3,Not as soft as I expected,"I bought this due to the many reviews here. Its got a cool form factor but it's not as soft and comfy as I expected. I tend to use my Crocs and Sanuk more, but honestly they don't look so cool."
3,NCIS season 1-6,"The videos are ok but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. All of the double DVD cases were briken during shipping and had to be replaced. Season 5 came with two disc 3 and 4 packages, but the disks were for the sequences. The product arrived within the time frame.I am very disappointed with this supplier and I will think twice before I accept an order from this vendor."
3,NCIS: Seasons 1-6,Paid to receive within 6-8 days. Product was in stock...ordered on 8 Dec...did not ship until 23 Dec according to postmark...I received 31 Dec.
2,Questionable legitimate copies.,"The DVDs came packaged as if I had bought them off the store shelf. However, when I opened the packages to see if they survived the shipment, I discovered that each box held a flimsy box with the DVDs placed in plastic CD/ DVD holders like is gotten from a office supply store. I am even questioning whether for the $216.00 I paid, that these are legitimate DVDs and not pirated copies. I will be extremely angry if even one of the DVDs does not play correctly. I mailed them to my intended recipient, and I will follow up with her as to whether they play like standard DVDs that is sold in a store, or if any of them are sub-standard.I have bought many items from Amazon, and through their web site. Up until this time, I have been happy with every single thing I have bought."
5,My favorite soup bowl,"I love the Gusto Bowl. It is the perfect size bowl for a hearty soup during these cold winter days. Of course, I also love Fiesta Ware. The Peacock goes great with my Persimmon and Chocolate dishes."
4,Can't beat Fiesta,"This is a great little bowl. It is sturdy, attractive, and fits well in my hands. It is a good size for soup or chili, and it can do double duty as serving bowl for dips or salsa. It fits neatly into the dishwasher and holds up to daily use.The only problem, which is merely a small one, is that it gets the gray streaks inside of it from table utensils faster than my other Fiesta dishes. It might be because it is white while the others are not."
4,The Perfect Bowl...Almost,"I have a few of these bowls and they are durable and the perfect size for just about everything you can think of.I have been looking for a good bowl for years and these fit the bill. I just wish they had one in 36 oz size. Quality control is another issue. Mega China's quality control seems to be sketchy at best. Therefore, if possible, buy the item from Amazon directly for a smooth return, if there are ""issues""."
3,The vinyl version is better,"This is the film version, and it is inferior to the original album release. Often times, soundtrack releases differed from their film versions because composers could tweak passages here and there and get a relaxex, dedicated recording, away from the harsh deadlines of film making. The result was often glorious, as was the case for Jerry Goldsmith's Patton.Add the famous George C. Scott speeches as prologue and epilogue and you have a classic. But only on vinyl. The vinyl version has better audio quality and is a better performance. It is a shame we are stuck with this dubbed version, which ironically is available on the Patton DVD as well."
1,Missing the Best,"This album does not have Patton's opening speech or the closing ""All Glory is Fleeting"" speech. It misses the two most important segments of the original soundtrack."
3,New page paper wouldn't make good toilet paper.,"It doesn't involve Amazon directly, but this issue of the Haynes Auto Repair Manual uses a cheap, coarse grade of page paper which tends to devaluate the manual, even though the printed content seems to remain good. Next time I will look for another brand of manaul simply because this horrible paper is just depressing to use, and sure doesn't contribute to the feeling of profesionalism that many users strive for."
1,very disapointing,I had been intrested in the arts of shape shifting for quite some time and had bought this book in hops to find tecnects to improve my results in transformation but sadly just after reading a few chapters I quickly began to realise that this book was simply wasn't for me. For starts she is a shaman and through my ocult studies shamanic transformation is more for the spiritual side becuse they(shamans belive that animals can teach us a lesson in life.) Look it up if you don't belive me!compared to a wizard transformation which is more on trying to actually turn into a specific creature in real life which was used as a weapon!
5,Bootleg?,"Apparently a bootleg, but this compilation is everything you want from the Lotus Eaters and a bit more (extra 12""-versions). I own a copy of the LP and although the price of this cd was quite extreme, it was worth any penny as I haven't stopped playing it since the day I bought it. Musically it's the sort of soft synthesizerstuff from the 80s, but actually with lots of guitars as well, which results in a mixture of New Gold Dream-era Simple Minds and early Aztec Camera...Titles as ""Two virgins tender"", ""The first picture of you"", ""When you look at boys"" probably tell you something about what to expect."
1,READ BEFORE EVEN THINKING OF BUYING THIS ALBUM,"I wish the aforementioned atomic bomb was remantled and aimed directly at U2.The bilingual lyrics in the beginning of Vertigo could be no more pointless and innane than what I had for dinner two years ago.Being berated with obviously ""well-thought out"" lyrics like ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah..."" at the end of their most ""promising"" track, makes me envision Bono hard at work at a desk some where writing down this lyrical garbage.Other than the truly overplayed, over-rated, and over done Vertigo, which needed to be truly lampooned, the other songs are literally not worth my most wasted minute.Please for the continuing sake of all types of music I beg of any reader; Do Not Buy This Trash!"
3,EASILY FORGETTABLE,EASILY FORGETTABLE. INSIPID.TOO UNINSPIRED. WHERE IS THE U2 THAT TAKES CHANCES?WORST ALBUM SINCE EARLY 80'S. THIS CD SOUNDS DULL AND VERY GENERIC. THE ONLY SONG THAT IS GOOD IS : CITY OF BLINDING LIGHT.U2 HAS TAKEN A TURN IN MUSICAL STYLE THAT WILL APPEAL ONLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER HEARD THE BAND BEFORE. ITS JUST A VERY MEDIOCRE CD.
2,"SD Russell, you are mistaken.","One listen of the first 1-20 seconds of ""Fast Cars"" lets you know clearly why it's a b-side.It is not one of U2's best songs, filler if anything... the same droning chorus over and over: not a song you'll look forward to and easily the least desirable song on the entire CD hands down.If I didn't know better (which I don't) I'd say SD is sitting on a load of these and wants to try to sell them at an outragious markup."
1,How to dismantle an abominable bum,"Like many Born Agains, Bono believes that he owes a lot to God, and God has made him a success. I believe that he owes this debt to incredible luck - there has never been a singer so average and a lyricist so mundane that has ever made as much cash as Bono & his band. U2's previous album just about scraped the bottom of the barrel of banal, but this one has bottomed it.How to dismantle this aboninable bum? Stop believing the hype and stop buying this stuff!"
1,All in all they're just another brick in the wall,"Zero Stars would be appropriate. Many of the folks who have spent their money on this are obviously interested in validating their purchase, which is fine. However, what it comes down to is this: does this CD contain anything worth buying? wise fans opinion, NO. Brianwashed posers whom try to be cool among their classmates, YES.This was the most horrendous U2 album I had ever heard! I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it. Really devoid of substance. Music is so lame and repetitive. It's ALL about the fashioned and overhyped name U2. Even critics seem to be brianless when they pushed this piece of crap forward. Bono can't sing, period.Please stop supporting this corporation. U2 2000 exemplifies how superficial and empty music has become.[...]"
2,Not worth it.,"I had high hopes for this album with the return of veteran U2 producer Steve Lillywhite. However, I was sadly disappointed. There are maybe three good songs on this album. The rest are just unlistenable. All That You Can't Leave Behind was such a great refresher after the disappointing POP. While this album continues in the ATYCLB vein, it doesn't even approach the melodic or lyrical quality of that album. I'm glad I didn't waste any more money on concert tickets to see this stuff live!"
3,Another Fine Offering,"This is another fine offering by U-2. The only thing that keeps it from being great is the inclusion of the I-Pod advertising jingle - VERTIGO. U2 needs to buy a clue about using I-Pod to promote their works. It's going the ruin the song for the public. Is there anyone out there not absolutely ill of hearing Vertigo. Again, that aside the album rocks!"
3,ESPERANTO,i am writing this review to express my opinion but also to get in touch with other people who like to write reviews here at amazon. I am going to write this review in a rare form of ESPERANTO which is not difficult to undestand for people who are gifted of a musical ear.El nuestro hero cu voce finissima dupa aver facut operatie ala cuerda vocala y cu trei amigos semper cu el an facut disc de calitate media. Ouch!eu sunt da cuerdo cu reviewer here under ca la banda u two an suferit de opinionea comunea de banda de rokko e rollo mai puternica de lumea. Stop.If you have feedback to this please no hesitar de contact el esperanto speaker at:carlogiova@yahoo.it
1,uhh...,"what more can be said than ""this flat out sucks""?does U2 even care about quality music? It seems they are only in it for the money. none of the songs inspire me, or even move me. I hope they quit soon."
5,U2 all the way,"Hey,whoever wrote that one review bad mouthing U2, try writing a review about the album instead of bitching about Bono's beliefs. And I wonder why U2's concert's sell out in mostly 10 minutes or less. Who the hell do you think you are making fun of people who like U2. For everyone reading this just ignore that review by whoever this person is, because he has no clue what he is talking about. U2 has been around since 1979 and are at their prime right now, and this album is another great example on how great they are.So who ever you are just go back listening to whatever you listen to and let ooo....about 3/4 of the world enjoy the greatest band in the world. Continue to kick some ass U2!!!"
3,Fast Cars,"Fast Cars is the greatest song of ALL TIME! It's better than Amazing Grace, Stairway to Heaven and Foggy Mountain Breakdown all put together times a billion!Sheesh give me a break.It's a song similar to Elevation but Elevation is a much better song.And it's similar to Canary in a Coalmine by another Brit band.It's nothing new and not that great."
4,Great rocking cd with heavy guitar and emotion where needed!,"I am very pleased with this cd,I got it at the Navy Exhchange for $14.99 with a bonus DVD! The DVD was very cool! My favorite songs,Yahweh,Miracle Drug,Sometimes you can't make it on your own,City of blinding lights,absolute classics,brilliant,thanks U2 for another amazing album,for those of you who just wanted another Joshua tree,grow up,get over it,U2 is moving forward and doing it quite well in my opinion,just wish The Ground Beneath Her Feet was included on the US version of All That You Can't Leave Behind! Merry Christmas and not that Happy Holidays Crap,come on now,Git-R-Done! RIP Dimebag Darrell,one of my fav guitar players!"
5,One of U2's Finest,"I bought this CD the day it came out. I had loved ""Vertigo"" and expected the rest of the CD to be like it. At first I was disappointed because of that, but after listening to it, I really loved it!!! I have been the biggest U2 fan since 1982 and have all their CDs. I believe this may now be my favorite.It is U2 returning to their roots in a refreshing and mature manner. Most importantly they have continued to create beautiful and original music as only they can.I can't really pick a favorite, but love ""City of Blinding Lights"", ""Love and Peace or Else"", ""All Because of You"", ""Crumbs From Your Table"" and ""Original of the Species"".After just having floor seats to this concert, I can tell you HTDAAB is just as good live as it is on CD. I can't wait till their next album."
2,U2 loses its edge,"As hard as I try to get into this CD, somehow it's just not happening for me. With the exception of a few songs (Vertigo, Crumbs on Your Table, and Miracle Drug), this sounds like some outtakes from All That You Can Left Behind.I have almost all U2 CD's and really enjoy the 80's and 90's material. But this CD just falls short.Starters to U2 would be better off getting Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree, or War."
1,Excuse me to whoevers underneath me.,"I noticed you mentioned that the people who have given this one star reviews are people wholike easily accessible, popular, commericalised music.....which is certainly not the case, as that is exactly what this pieceof a [...] of an album is.Have'nt you noticed the one star reviewers are praising ""POP"" U2s most disliked record by many cause its not very accessible, and was actually a commercial disastor (thanking god)This album is just unbearable, Vertigo, is the most commercialized sounding song I have ever heard, and sounds designed to sell records.U2 should NOT go on tour with this album, they should record anew album and say sorry to everyone who likes actual music and a band who writes actual rock n roll guitar tunes and who mean it - instead of selling themselves and looking lame on a IPOD commercial.[...]"
2,U2 is better than this,"This is a decent album by general standards, but U2's least evocative work. This album is plain and forgettable compared to their other excellent work. There are several strong tracks, but the lyrical content overall is weak, and the musical content is nothing new from average pop rock. How has the studio sapped the emotion of such a great live band? If you are new to U2, check out Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby instead."
2,Listen to it a thousnad times before attempting to dismanlte any bombs,"Lets all hope U2 doesn't end with this album. And lets not be nice in our reviews just b/c its U2. Listeners do not need to mature. U2 exist for the listeners and should be trying to enterain us, Thats their job, thats why they are famous and rich. People do not exist to appreciate art, Art exist to be apreciated by people.That is, if its good enough.The cd doesn't completely suck,Of course not. But its one of the weakest albums I've heard from them. but, I'm a young listener and only have 3 of their cds, Joshua Tree, All you can't leave behind, Aching baby, and the 18singles disk. All You Can't Leave Behind is their best album by my thinking.This one is a step down throm that."
4,U2 backlash...,"Wow!! I can't believe the U2 bashing in some of the reviews. I guess success and talent breed jealousy and anger in some people. HTDAAB is a strong album. The first three songs- ""Vertigo, ""Miracle Drug"" and ""Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own""- are worth the price of the cd by themselves. Writing great songs with memorable melodies is not easy. U2 have been doing it for over twenty years! While the new album doesn't break new ground like some of their others (The Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby etc.) it does deliver what most U2 fans want: Bono's soaring vocals, Edge's angular guitar work and the reliable rhythm section of Clayton and Mullins Jr. If you've ever been fortunate enough to see U2 live and experience the spiritual connection one feels with the band and other fans during the moving hymn ""40"" you'll realize how irrelevant those one star reviews are."
3,Above average at best,"This album is above average at best. As an album, it lacks the raw creative energy of Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and Pop. The previous album ATYCLB was a load of mediocrity(the only U2 album I did'nt keep), and it was disappointing to see the band release such material. On the bright side, HTDAAB certainly puts U2 back in the business of making solid music. Having said that, the album as a whole does not really offer anything new for the most part. While there are a few solid songs like 'Miracle Drug', 'Original of the Species', 'Sometimes You can't Make it on Your Own' and 'A Man and a Woman', the last one mentioned is probably the only song on the album that offers something fresh. Importantly, even some of these better songs have a 'neatly crafted' flavor, and lack the raw energy and creative genius of U2. I hope the band will devote more time to the next album, and not be afraid to push the envelope as they did with Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and Pop."
1,Save your money,"Save your moneyif you're wise, you'll download this album. You shouldn't dine this Mc Donald's happy clown."
3,"Ok, but not the best","Been a longtime fan (day 1 actually), and have found the albums getting weaker with age. This one is good, it's a Unforgettable Fire meets Actung Baby meets All That You Can't Leave Behind, but not near as strong as any of those. U2 has put out several prolific peices over the years, but not on this one. Worth the $10, but don't expect anything ground breaking."
1,Where did it all go wrong?,"What ever happened to U2? they sold out.""All that you can't leave behind"" was not half of a bad album, although it was a bit poppy with ""Stuck in a moment"" and ""Beautifull daY"".Whats happening to music these days?"
1,I want a refund ..I imagine U want one 2,"This was hyped as a rockin album...it sounds like Muzak for withdrawing rock addicts. I paid only ten bucks for my copy, and that's too much money for this droning piece of crap. It also reinforces my usual habit of buying ONLY greatest hits albums. The only decent song is Vertigo...the rest is slumber inducing vomit.A horrible disappointment!"
2,The Mighty U2 Have Taken A Fall,"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a real bringdown for U2. Their previous CD, All That You Can't Leave Behind was a career highlight. Almost every song on that CD had a memorable melody. On How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, the melodies are few and far between.At the least the CD starts out strong with the high energy single Vertigo. Origin of the Species, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, and One Step Closer are the best of the rest as on the fourth listen their melodies stand out somewhat.However, the other songs are pretty forgettable. Yes, Bono sings them with some conviction and the Edge add some neat sepcial effects on his guitar. However, many of the pieces are a little too restrained and coupled with the limited melodies on his hour long CD, I would recommend passing on this collection.Get All That You Can't Leave Behind and Achtung Baby instead."
4,"""ATYCLB"", part 2.","After about 90 listens now, I find this to be another solid U2 album. What I notice most about it, is that it really reminds me of the last record, ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"", which I guess makes sense. Specifically, ""Vertigo"" seems to be the ""Beautiful Day"" of this album, and ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"", sounds like this records ""Stuck In A Moment"", etc. However, this is not a bad thing, as the last album was excellent. What keeps this from being a 5-star release, is the few tracks I consider to be really good filler, and not ""wow"" songs. In short, this album is easy to sum up: the U2-haters can pass on it obviously, but the U2-lovers need it like the rest of their releases, and most will consider it to be the ""Bomb""."
3,OK CD,"U2's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb CD is OK, not great, not bad, OK. I'm not very big for slow songs so, I'm not a giant fan of the songs (except Vertigo) on this CD too much. It starts off with my favorite song, Vertigo. Actually Vertigo is the only reason I even got this CD. It's a GREAT song. With great lyrics and good guitar it's in my top 5 for favorite songs ever. If you like Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, or/and Ocean Avenue you'll love this song. I also like Love and Peace or Else and city of Blinding Lights. Miracle Drug, all because of You, Crumbs from your table, and Yahweh are decent songs.OVERALL GRADE: 5.5/10RECOMENDATION: if your like me (I like Yellowcard, green day, simple plan bands like that) I would download Vertigo instead of buying this CD but, if you like slower songs i would reccomend buying this CD."
4,Not their Best but Very Good,"I had read too many good reviews before I heard the album so I was a bit underwhelmed. I was expecting their best yet. Still, most of the songs are very good. Vertigo is a clear hit. Lyrics are of the high quality you would expect of U2. Besides Vertigo, none of the songs blew me away. I fully expect to appreciate this more each time I hear it."
3,"Hmmmm, What do I say?","I have loved U2 since I first heard them in 1981 with the ""Boy"" album. Edge's soaring guitar and the lyrics always reached out and touched me. I followed them through all the changes and albums and mostly they have never failed to please, even ""Pop"". This one leaves me with mixed feelings.I first heard ""Vertigo"" on the Apple Music webpage and played it over and over again. I went out and bought the single soon after I first heard it. I was anticipating something spectacular. Unfortunately, the album did not live up to the promise of ""Vertigo"".After my first listen I said ""What happened????"". It just did not meet expectations. As I often do I listened to it again and became pleasantly surprised by what I heard.Most of the album is good and the songs are well done but do not fit well with ""Vertigo"". Yahweh has to be the weakest of the bunch. So, on the whole, this is a good album but not a great album as, say, ""Joshua Tree"" or ""Unforgetable Fire""."
1,U2 most disgusting album getting Grammy's attention to bust sales!!?!?,"I don;t get how this CD got nominated in first place and then landed some major Grammy awards? Released in November 23, 2004, didn't they already get a Grammy last year for the same stuff?Hey Grammy/Music Industry Leaders!! - I lost my faith in you or music! A real artist wouldn't really care to get your stupid award, cause you know what?!? U2 sucks! oh what a horrible album for God's sake!"
3,Just one song,I did not like this CD very much. Honestly I just bought it for Vertigo and that's about it.
1,How to dismantle a U2 fan with 14 bucks in the record store,"Step 1, kick him in the crotch and tell him Bono is a coward and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is total crap. Step 2, take his money and spend it on quality Mike Patton records instead of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Step 3, move to the next isle over to where they sell Green Day records and repeat steps 1 and 2, as you did with How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Then pull the Ipods out of their rears and huck them against the wall, oh yeah I hate U2's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Perhaps I wouldnt hate How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb if I didnt have to hear it and see it every friggin two seconds."
1,Worst U2 Album Yet,"I used to love this group, but they are so OVER.Aside from 'Vertigo', which in and of itself gets painful to listen to after a few times, there is no reason to buy this album. Just buy the single.Honestly, what does U2 think? That they're so fab and rich they can just churn out any crap, slap some 'cool' sounding titles on songs and people will just eat it up? Apparently."
1,How To Dismantle a Rock Career,"It's no wonder Vertigo was the first release from this album and came out approximately 3 years before the rest of the cd. It's the only listenable track to be found. The rest of How to Put Out A Really Bad CD can best be described as ""tedious."" Every song is slow and boring, and there isn't a hook to be found anywhere. You won't be walking around with any of these songs stuck in your head. They are that unremarkable. Oh well, U2 has put out bad work before (see my review of Achtung Baby), perhaps a few years from now they will put out someting decent. If not, they can count this CD as the first in their eventual box set titled ""How To Dismantle a Rock Career."""
5,READY FOR ACTION,"How many U2 albums have we seen fall flat on their feet in the last 12 days? The answer, of course, is one. Luckily, this album has broken this trend - falling flat on its feet. Many core fans, such as Bono and THE_GREAT_WHITE_SANDWICH, have been disapointed with this album and are exchanging it for GOLD_COINS_APLEANTY - the latest smash hit from 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'. However, this album doesn't stick to that trend, but veers off into a new and boring direction, sticking close to its routes. I certainly won't be buying this album again in the future. Good luck trying to find a copy, it's worth every penny! 3/5 Stars, Album of the year!Signed,Bono"
1,How I miss Pop times !!!!!,"well, this album isn't good, really. I'm so sorry but I'm really dissapointing of this HTDAAB. This short album has nothing new and fresh, and Bono sounds horrible, making this LP his worst album performance ever !!!.Pop changed my life, it was an amazing musical journey ( really Larry ) and I felt in love with Pop at first sight, unlike this safe and almost ATYCLB bomb. Bono looks ugly, old and tired with his long hair and his little beard. The whole band sounds uninspired and boring, the songs are common and predictable, there is nothing exciting in this music, which repeats the ATYCLB design.PLEASE U2, STOP UNDERRATING AND HATING POP AND OVERRATING ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND, PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN POP, THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG IN ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND !!!Thank You"
5,U2 has made its best,"I was never a U2 fan, but when my dad got this album for Christmas, i listened to it because i was bored and was pretty cool!I've only listened to a couple of songs, here they are.1. Vertigo- awesome! video is more cool though2. Miracle Drug- uhhhhhhh.... too slow3. Sometimes you can't make it(on your own)- slow but OK4. Love and peace- Cool rythem to the song5. City of blinding lights- Piano annoys me, but pretty cool6.All Because of you- makes you want to dance!12. Fast Cars-sounds mexican but cool."
1,my opinion,"I DO NOT like this CD. True, I don't like most of what U2 has done, but c'mon, enough is enough. For those who think that U2 are good just because they sell millions of records and sell out their shows, so does Brittany Spears. Are you fans of her work also?I also agree with the reviewer that says there seem to be people giving unhelpful votes to everyone who gives this a high mark. Well, I gave some of them helpful reviews because they said whatthey like about the CD and have other reviews. I know what they like and since I don't like any of it, I can safely say I have different taste in music.I like music that is COMPLETELY not mainstream or is a lot more aggressive than U2. SOme of my favorites have been on MTV alot, but have a completely different sound than U2, such as Rollins Band or Ministry(not With Sympathy though). SO if you like harder edged music, stay away from U2. If not, you may like it. I just don't.Thank you for reading."
1,PATHETIC,"This album has absolutely nothing to do with such masterpieces as AchtungBaby, Joshua Tree, Pop or Zooropa.In other words, the brilliant team have died.This fake bomb is apparently ephemeral. It's their testament to theirweak of their lifeless music nowadays.U2 have become insurmountable. Their egos are bigger than their music,which is leaving themselves by going to the Grammy Awards, i Tunes andthe road.This song is not a rebel song... this song is an iPod one.PATHETIC."
5,How to dismantle an atomic bomb review,"Excellent cd. Favorite tracks are Vertigo, City of Blinding Lights. Give it 5 out of 5. About time U2 had a new album"
4,U2 Claims Their Place,"Hey, it ain't the Joshua Tree and it ain't Achtung Baby. Hell, it ain't even Zooropa.But, to release an album this good -- with music that has some relevance and depth and soul -- after 25 years says it all. In my book, U2 is, after the Beatles, the greatest Rock and Roll Band in history.For you Mick, Keith and the boys fans out there who will cast Stones at this assessment, when you look at what they were producing after 25 years, I got two words for you: ""Dirty Work"""
3,"Mmmh, it could've been better","I think this one is the second part of ""All that you can't leave behind"", because it sounds like an ending 90's record. It's not a bad record, we can enjoy 3 or 4 songs with new proposals. They are no more the band that surprise us taking risks with records like ""Zooropa"" or ""Pop"" even the one I mention at the beggining.I recommend to buy it if you love U2 and you don't have big expectations for new proposals."
2,Poster child for downloading,"Vertigo, the first song, is of course great. After that, I defy anyone to find something that's ""catchy"". A few other tracks might be OK and the rest kind of meander like some kind of U2 clone band.The thing that stood out about old U2 was how many tracks on a CD were great (not just OK). No longer. Download Vertigo from whereever and skip the rest."
1,worst sound ever,"Have you seen Dumb and Dumber when one of them makes the most annoying sound in the world? I would rather hear that for an hour than listen to this CD again. That's how much I hated it. I had only heard the one song on the radio and thought it was awful, but then when the CD won all those awards I thought maybe the other songs would be different since that happens a lot. I WAS WRONG! They were all bad. PLEASE stay away from this CD if you can."
1,U2 have become comfortably numb,"This new album sounds like an album a bunch of 40 year olds would make, full of nice and decent melodies. U2 have always been about staying relevant and being fresh and they've managed to do, at least until Pop. I still don't know what happened after Pop, which was an extraordinary and smash album. U2 turned for grammy worthy music, becoming to obsessed with being the biggest band in the world, no matter music. HTDAAB just seems like a safe, adult pop record full of over-baked tunes. With headphones is even worse. Overall this album is a watered down version of ATYCLB. For sure it will hit number one, thanks to many U2 completists who will insist on buying it.Remember the second best seller album from all times ?...U2 have become comfortably numb"
1,Get real U2!!!,"Well what a dissapointment.U2 have become a commercially mainstream crappy band.What a shame.Bono lied about this record.The whole band did.""A real rock n roll record""???""The real rock u2 album""???""The old U2 updated, best ever album""???Sure whatever, I had high hopes for this album, I thought I could trust U2, oviously not."
3,DISMANTLED,"First off, I must say that the ""Josh"" reviewer is seemingly a narrow-minded, right wing racist who should keep most of his short-sighted opinions to himself and his 'adoring wife'.That said, I must say that this latest effort from U2 is good, not great. For me, primarily, due to the lyrical style. Not their strongest compared to previous efforts. Vertigo teases the listener to believe there's some strong, complex coming. But it never really seems to arrive. Musically, it is back to basics, which can be good thing. But the content lacks a bit in the telling. I think Bono's been keeping too busy with other things of late.But still, they are one of the best bands out still. At least MY mind is open!!!"
1,Warning: position wanted a singer,"seeing is believing Bono. Where's ""the best U2 album"" ?sadly, despite evidence, some fans turn a deaf ear, allowing Bono ""sign"" as horrible as he can.Nevermind this commercial joke. At least in Pop Bono had passion and emotion, despite his voice, and the song sounded extraordinary anyway, because of its great melodies.Bono displays an awful degree in his voice here, and the songs are tuneless."
2,Perhaps.....,"I'm a having a little problem with 'Atomic Bomb'. Perhaps it was the pre-release hype which raised my expectations. Perhaps it was the hard-edged sound of the single, Vertigo which lead me to believe the remainder of the album would follow suite instead of being relative mellow. Perhaps I'm partial to the production work of Eno & Lanois who's influence seems to have been turned down in the mix. Perhaps it's because Bono's voice *sounds like* it was overdubbed onto instrumental tracks recorded in a different studio at a different time. Perhaps it's because I liked 'All That You Can't...' a lot and 'Bomb' is quite different. Dunno. Perhaps you'll like it more than I did."
5,One of their best albums so far,"HTDAAB is up there with their best hits of the 80's. For everyone who has been waiting for them to return, they are back. There isn't a track on this album that I don't like. They have definitely earned the right as the biggest rock band in the world with this album. It is heart felt and thoughtful. You know alot of work and thought went into this album, but I don't expect anything less from U2"
2,Just Not Their Best Stuff,"U2 is a pretty amazing band. They have been together a long time with the same members ( a very rare thing these days), and they have put out some incredible albums, and many times over re-invinted their sound during their career. This album doesn't do any of that, the songs are nice, but way too safe sounding. There is no new sound here, and honestly it sounds like step backwards in terms of song writing. I still like U2 a lot, and this album doesn't change that, like any band some albums will be classics, and others won't, this album is one of the others."
1,DISAPOINTING!!!!,"Since 1991 U2 have been releasing sub par albums!!!Although Zooropa & Pop were ok, they hardly had the magic of their previous releases. But the band went at an all time low with their first release of 2000, All that you can't leave behind despite having decent single releases was just very bland and void of ideas.In truth How to dismantle an atomic bombs failings are hardly surprising, there is nothing new, and they seemed to have rehashed old ideas and just basically turning the volume up whilst hoping we don't notice how bad the tunes are.There is nothing special about this bomb, and though it blasts at times (Vertigo, Because of You) this bomb turns out to have a malfunction and never seemed to have worked anyway!!!"
1,U2 have sold out.,"If your a U2 fan you will with out a doubt be dissapointed.They said this would be a raw rock'n roll record and the best record that they had ever made, well that was all ""talk.""Anyone who knows what real music is can tell that this album is an absolute flop and in a few years people will realise that it was crap, not to mention the band."
2,Smells Like Sellouts,"Same old same old from the next band to provide the soundtrack for a car commercial. I'm so disappointed! I was used to U2 providing me with fresh fodder with each collection they released. This time around it sounds like more of the same stuff they presented the last time. Oops, maybe cause that's what is. Had some leftovers from 2003 so they repackaged it (thanks Steve), pumped it up with a big marketing scheme (thanks other Steve) and viola the public bought it. Where can I get in line to return mine?"
2,Retirement Beckons,"I'm a lifelong U2 fan . . . and alas, this album is the epitome of ""product"". This band clearly is like Michael Jordan if he tried coming back a 3rd time, today - formerly the best, but now tired and way past their prime.With a few decent exceptions, we've heard this all before on previous albums - MUCH better. You can almost see the rust on their instruments.Still, track 12, the acoustic one on the limited edition, is pretty cool - they should have done a whole album like this . . . acoustic, stripped down, exploring new musical turf for them. Something different. That might have worked, and at least thrown a fun curveball to us fans.Instead, we get a band whose charisma is intact, but songwriting skills eroded like a sandcastle at high tide. Just gone. This album is like 90% the ultimate rock n' roll sins - Predictable and BORING."
4,"HATED AT FIRST, BUT AFTER A FEW LISTENS 4 ****'S","The latest flavor of the u2's arsenal IS NOT as bad as a few of the mentioned reviews. It grows on you, not the lyrics always, but the overall blend of the band's music and tone. Let's face it, you can just keep going like the Stones and Aerosmith, or still put out some pretty good back to back CD's like u2 has done, and be remembered for them. I didn't like it at first, but then before you know it has grown on you, just like the Seinfeld episode of George C. when he kept keep saying COSTANZA over & over to his date, She was drawn into it after hearing it a few times......this is how this CD is.. IT GETS IN YOUR HEAD AND SOUNDS GOOD after awhilew/bonus singles make on overall cool mix...FAST CARS...my cell is ringing no idea I need to know who is calling,.... I got the nightly news to get to know the ENEMY...All I want is a picture of you.....wouldn't it be great to know the enemy............"
3,Aging Rocker Begins to Show It,"I own all of U2's albums and consider their contribution to rock monumental. However, I found ""Atomic Bomb"" to be somewhat tepid. Bono seems a little tired, a little slow, a little disconnected from his roots. Without going through a blow by blow, suffice to say that, in spite of 2 or, perhaps, 3 notable songs, the album never really gets off the ground. Then again, living up to albums like ""War,"" ""The Neverending Fire"" and ""Joshua Tree"" would be tough for anyone. Led Zeppelin, Queen, Bowie...and an endless parade of others suffered similar fates. There seems to be a limit to the amount of great music any one artist can produce, at least in the world of rock."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This album is boring and slow. Nothing really ""rocks"", the songs are just plain dull. Go buy the old stuff!"

4,Good movie.,I found this to be an interesting movie. It touched on important themes and wasn't too ridiculous. Good ending. I recommend it.
5,IT'S SUPERLATIVE!,"Without questions, this superlative text ranks among the finest and the most up-to-date package on medical microbiology. It demonstrates that this interesting branch of medicine can be both versatile and concise. The book is full of valuable illustrations which students can depend on for quick revisions. Ubiquitous tables, colourful charts and figures all help to accelerate comprehension. Also, there are two additional sections whose chapters handled Immunology and Parasitology in significant detail.No single textbook may be without shortcomings, but I sincerely recommend this one."
3,Old design was more of a Whisper,"I have owned whisper filters before, therefore I was not hesitant to buy this one when the impeller on my old one let go. The whisper does work great. The only thing is that the new filter had a loud whirring sound... it isn't a whisper. The impeller on the newer design is attached to the tube assembly which acts as a sounding board and magnifies the noise.So with the help of some `JB Weld' I glued the old impeller back together and switched it out. All is quiet again."
2,Disappointed.,"After just 2 weeks, makes a loud sound and stops intermittently. I have to use two brand new ones for 60 gals to cover my 65 gal tank! Very weak. One malfunctioning and cant return since i disposed box. I ordered bew impeller hopefully thats the problem but it is stressful."
1,Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere...,"I got the Tetra Whisper 60 in a 55g aquarium kit, thinking I would save money. Not only was I wrong...I was wrong and angry.Believe me, if you get a defunct product...it's really defunct. My Whisper leaks HEAVILY. Will never buy an HOB filter again.I see there are many positive reviews (despite the constant complaining about the noise - why would you give it 5 stars then complain about how loud it is?...because it IS loud). Well good for you. I lost my receipt and can't get a replacement, so I'm out $50.Seriously people, if you're going to keep fish, spend the money and buy a product that's worth it. Don't buy a cheaply made piece of crap like I did."
2,Diesel engine,"I purchased a power filter 40I and it was very quiet and worked very well on my smaller aquarium, so I purchased one of these Power Filter 60s for my 55 gallon tank. It was so loud I could hear it upstairs. I have since purchased 2 more 40I filters to use in it's place and hope to sell THIS one to some sucker on craigs list."
5,A must-have for ALL scrapbookers!,"I had never done scrapbooking before until my friend Leeza asked if I wanted to do a page for her book, 'Scrapbooking Traditions'. I was a little apprehensive at first until I started following the methods and tips laid out in Leeza's book. I couldn't believe how simple and helpful the tips were! I ended up putting together a nice scrapbook page that you can see in 'Scrapbooking Traditions'. Even for a first timer like me, Leeza's scrapbook tips and examples made scrapbooking fun and rewarding. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever considered scrapbooking.PS/ Leeza didn't ask me to write this, I just have to let others know when I see a good and informative book!"

I have celiac and inevitably there will be times that i am glutinafied through cross contamination or a friend just not knowing what I can eat. This definitely speeds up the recovery when taken as soon as possible, once I know I have eaten something wrong. I still get some uncomfortable side effects from gluten but this helps me through it faster."
1,Nothing like the image :-(,"I just received this product this afternoon ""Ware Double Fleece Hang-N-Tunnel Crinkle Small Pet Sleeper"". It states that the ""color may vary"" which is fine but the only portion of the description that is correct is that it is fact a ""tunnel"" and it does have ""2 straps"", everything else is wrong.The outside of the product is a thin material and the inside is completely nylon, there is nothing fuzzy about it and no fleece of any kind. The good thing is that I ordered it from Amazon so they will take care of the issue for me I'm sure.Good luck with your pets :-)"
5,The BEST Filter Pads For The Worlds Best Filters,An eheim fan for over 35 years they are always my filter of choice. This pack was perfect for my 2078 (Pro 3) which needed a make over more than a cleaning. In the past I've tried other brands but they pale in comparison to eheil quality. The Blue pre filter can remove particulate matter down to three microns in size and the white pads polish the water equally well.In most cases these are perfect for the Pro 3 linebut would be far too small for the XL and 2080 both of which I have as well. In all cases the pads remove debris and keep your water sparkling clear. They can be cleaned in a bucket of tank water so as not to destroy the colonized nitrifying bacteria and then used again - but it's a good idea to replace the pads every 6-12 months depending upon the fish you keep and your filtration.This pack is an excellent deal and with Prime you get free two day shipping to boot - making this purchase just that much sweeter.
5,great for a 2 year old,"got this February 20, 2009 for our new apt but my son really never knew there was stars intel he was 2 and i put a bigger light in his room for him to see them glow its great for 2 year oldspaid total: $12.45"
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"My only knock on it, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that I'd prefer if the end you attach your shower head to were angled down more."
5,"Finaly, water pouring directly down on my head!!",I purchased it because we have a single person type shower stall. The older neck sprayed water on the opposing side more than on our body. Raising that outlet up higher has solved that problem for the most part. At least you're not getting sprayed directly in the face.
4,I'm tall too!,"Yes, I suffered from the hunchback shower syndrome too. My shorter wife wasn't so thrilled when this was installed. My only complaints would be that I'd love to see the round plate a little larger to cover up the hole in the wall I had to make to install this - I hate the previous owner for what self-help he did for this house. And that I agree with the others, the bend should be about 20 degrees more. WIth the new showerhead, the shower of water hits the back wall and rim at it's lowest, and it likes to flood the floor if I leave a cap in the curtain. But I still give it 4 stars as the only relief for taller people against houses built by midgets."
5,"Looks nice, easy install","Pros:1. Looks good2. Easy screw in installCons""1. None at the momentOther Thoughts:I bought these to replace some cheap plastic ones in my apartment and they are doing great."
4,very nice,worth the money. good deal. looks very nice in shower. i cant think of anything else to write about a shower arm
2,"Why, Queensryche? WHY?","Oh, the horror. I cannot accurately describe just how bad this album is. Geoff Tate's voice sounds strained and off-key at times. Even the background singers sound old and tired. Tate even appears to have trouble remembering the words to the songs on OM:I, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt....he could just be ad-libbing or something due to having sung those songs over and over for the last 10 years. Chris DeGarmo is not on this album, and it shows. Kelly Gray was a poor replacement for him, but Mike Stone is just abominable. Operation: Mindcrime is one of the best albums *ever* made, and I'll be damned if I want some talentless idiot taking ""creative license"" with the lead guitar parts. In addition, the mixing of this album is just abominable. I am a huge, huge Queensryche fan, and listening to this disaster really hurts."
3,Data,"Having read this book several times, I agree with the Historical Society that it is an excellent basis for future research. Possibly by someone who is not an employee. The data collected is wonderfully presented but the actual history is very dry and missing the real impact on the residents outside New York City. The one thing which I think is missing is a comparison to the approaches taken to water supplies by the other great cities of the world. This would make it a very informative and living book. It has local appeal indeed but would make very uninteresting reading indeed to anyne outside of New York. However, as an Engineer, I can appreciate the work involved here and did enjoy it in parts."
1,Hard to believe,"Hard to believe I received the same product as the other reviewers. The whistle is fine, but the hat and bandana are paper-thin...as in you can see right through them. I'm not that particular (see other reviews) but this was ridiculous.I had bought this product to use in a themed train basked for our preschool charity auction, but was too embarrassed to put them in. Went and bought a red bandana at a sports store for $1.50 and an engineer hat at a museum shop for $8.00. Ate the cost for this, but at least kept my dignity."
5,Exceptional value,At this price you can't go wrong. Really a fine piece of craftsmanship--and it works for the intended purpose.
1,will not hold up to the desert sun,Was replacing an older set of rails from a different company. Took a lot of time to prep the bed and clean with solvent. Applied all the included tape plus another 16 feet of trim tape from the auto parts store and they lasted 3 days in april before bending and warping all over the place. Now of course that it is over 110 degrees in Las Vegas they are only much much worse. Next time it is spray in bed liner or nothing.
3,Confused?,"Looks great, good tuner keys, light weight, but one problem. It's really really quiet. It has volume knobs but when I turn them nothing happens. My neighbor mentioned something about needing an ""amp(sp?)"" But I'm not really a big fan of energy drinks especially ones made by Mt.Dew."
5,An excellent work in sufi tafsir,"Following the studies in classical tafsir that Routledge is editing, K. Sands has done an excellent work. She goes through all the mains tenets and ideas of the sufi interpretation of the Quran. The ellection of the chapters and the authors gives a good resume of the main ways that the sufis has looked to the Quranic text.In my opinion an ""must have"" book for those who want to deep in the studies of quarnic exegesis or sufi think."
2,What The???,"Not only bad by Van Halen standards, but by any standards. Even we die-hards have a difficult time listening to this. Two stars only because Eddie's still the best. This is such a poor effort that I would recommend taking the chance of file swapping but it probably won't be found on any music sharing service."
1,Horrible Album by a horrible singer,"Veering away from their great days with Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth, th=is album was not nearly as well performed nor did it have any catchy tunes. The new lead singer Cherone was unable to fill his spot atop the ladder with the legendary band, and the band sank back into depression.Van Halen III was definately the worst album by Van Halen ever recorded even worse than DIVER DOWN, the previously worst one."
4,horrible singer but incredible,"Yea, ok. Gary Cherone has a horrible shrill voice that is way to high in the mix and is very sour sounding. That aside, Edward really shines on this one. Nevermind his solos, listen to his rhythum playing. Its absolutly mind bending. Too bad that Gary is on this disc because its Edwards most impressive and inventive rhythum work since Fair Warning but nobody will ever discover it because of the aweful singing. Oh well. Maybe they will put out the disc one day with the singing taken out. That would be killer!"
4,VH 3 Gone before I realised it was good..........,Van Halen 3 took me about a while to like....and now I love it. The album is not as easy to listen to as Van Halens earlier stuff and this dissapoints many who prefer the earlier light hearted stuff. However this album is now one of my favourite by VH and I believe that Van Halen had completed a dangerous quest in the execution of this album with Gary - they had successfully modernised. Garys vocals are excellent and the rest of the guys are up to their usual standards. 'Without You' is amazing....
3,Not bad at all...,"The third reincarnation of Van Halen has been maligned by a lot of people in the aftermath of the soap opera following the exit of Sammy Hagar.When the smoke clears and people will listen to this with a more open mind there are some pleasant surprises in store,in fact this record can boast a number of tunes that could be Van Halen classics:'Dirty Water Dog',the excellent'Once','Josephina',showcasing Gary Cherone as a very good vocalist.Problems are with the flat production and the fact that on other songs Cherone tries too hard to immitate Hagar which doesn't suit him at all.This album sould have been reworked and re-released.There's some great potential here."
1,Dull and unartistic,"Thankfully I didn't pay money for this mess, only borrowed it to have a listen. This doesn't even sound like Van Halen and I don't mean just the new voice, the music doesn't even remind me of the other incarnations of the band. The songs on this CD are just boring. They never go anywhere or present you with anything to get excited about. One song after another that just sit there and beg to be ignored. It looks like this may have been a career killer. Hard to believe a major artist could make a CD this bad."
2,2 Stars For Anything With Eddie,"Oh my god this is a horrible album. I remember when I heard the first VH album, and the first time I heard 5150; and believe me, I won't be able to forget this album after years of therapy. Give me the DLR Band or the Red Rocker anyday to this crap. I can't believe this album was even released it's that bad. The downward spiral of VH didn't begin with this album, but I don't see how it can get worse. Come on Ed, I'm over thirty with two kids but I still ROCK. What the hell happened to you? Come back Ed....just repeat after me, there's no place like Rock, there's no place like Rock..."
2,Van Halen and Extreme don't mix,"I am a big fan of both Van Halen and Extreme, and as separate bands they really rock. It would seem logical that having Extreme's Gary Cherone lead Van Halen would be like the marriage of chocolate and peanut butter in a Reese's peanut butter cup. Unfortunately, it more likely resembles chocolate and sardines. To put it plainly, it just doesn't work."
1,Van Halen Struggles With New Album; Singer,"The trick to reviewing any Van Halen album made after 1984, is that you cannot compare the band then and the band now. After approaching the first listen with an open mind, there are few positives. How can Cherone expect to re-establish himself when he sounds too much like Hagar? The tracks seem drawn out and especially tired. Eddie can still rock with the best of them, but that's about it. He co-produced the album and the tracks seem to be everywhere, but not hitting anything successfully. What does that say about him as a producer? They have drifted too far from the sound makes them a successful band. Many VH fans don't realize is that it's not so much who their lead singer is, it's more who produces their album. That having been said, does anybody have Ted Templeton's number handy?"
4,An excellent beginning to the third incarnation,"This isn't like anything we've heard from them before. I don't think this will win any new fans, but as a diehard fan, I like it a lot. Songs like ""Once"", and Eddie's lead on ""How Many Say I"" definately perk my interest. I wouldn't expect anything less than perfection from Van Halen and they didn't disappoint."
1,Worst VH Album Ever,"I'm tired of lamenting the passage of Dave and Sammy. This album is just plain awful. What was Eddie thinking with ""How Many Say I?"""
1,Van Halen III,"I listened to the album and was not happy with what I heard. Gary Cherone just does not cut it. It sounds like someone is kicking him in the groin as he sings. His voice is very irritating and i really cannot listen and enjoy the album. Unfortunately Sammy is not too cooperative and Eddie is short tempered, where VHIII would have been another great album, it is not. Right now Sammy is probably laughing at all of Eddie's hard work go down the toilet with Cherone's awful attempt to fill Sammy's shoes."
3,"Not the Best V.H., But not too bad","Yes, I know. Where is the old V.H. gone? Well, this disc is not too bad, IMO. Gary does a decent job with the boys, and it's nice to hear some lyrics that are not all about love, sex, and women (so overplayed). I really like a ""Year to the Day"" and ""Fire in the Hole"". I would recommend this disc to anyone. And I have. Of course, most didn't like it. But different strokes to different folks. Maybe the boys of V.H. are finally over."
1,Total Garbage,"Being a HUGE fan of the band since 1984, I never in my life thought I would say this, but...VAN HALEN SUCKS!!! I wish I could give it zero stars!! I've listened to it over and over again, trying to like it, but it just makes me want to puke. At least Sammy's still putting out good stuff."
1,Strange album,"It's not o typical Van Halen album. After one year listening to it, I must say I didn't like it. Hope Sammy or D. Coverdale helps Van Halen return to the great days. I just think if Coverdale enter in Van Halen, the band had to change the name, maybe to Coverdale - Van Halen, because Van Halen is gone without Sammy or Dave. It's part of history of music."
1,The only bad VH album!,"The only part that's any good is the first 1/2 minute of track 11. SAMMY RULES! Maybe they can bury their differences and reunite - until then, I'm not interested. They should've hired Sebastian Bach from Skid Row."
1,Was there an early Y2K problem when recording this album???,"I've listened to VH for years and loved VH for years. I thought maybe with Eddie not painting and putting together his own guitars from parts anymore he would have more time to produce a better album. Maybe it's the fact that with all their money there's just too many toys to play with in the studio, I'm not sure. What I do know is that they hired a good parrot in Gary Cherone to try and sing like Sammy. All I can say (and I hope that one day I might be wronged) is that the days of VH are gone. Gone are the cool riffs, fantastic leads, and great music, from the days of Dave to even the days of Sammy. Not every band can come out with a good album every time and I guess this is their time. I think what Eddie should do is take some advice and take it ""one day at a time"", after all this is life, the one you get, so come and have a ball."
1,Different Singer same old Eddie,Alright guys some songs are OK but thats all I'm giving them. Eddie plays some good solos but it's not like we didn't hear the same ones on Balance. David gets kicked out again so what does Eddie do he sings himself a little ditty. It's not happenin. We miss ya Dave.
1,5 Stars? You must be Crazy!,"Everyone who gave this album 5 stars should have their head examined. 5 Stars should represent a Classic Album, this is no where near a good album - let alone classic. Stop trying to convince yourself, ""the first time I listened to it I didn't like it"", and tell Eddie and Alex how you really feel. This album sucks - next singer! Please, the next time you have the urge to recommend or critique an album, stick with the Top 40 crowd, that's where your musical tastes belong."
1,Worst Van Halen CD ever!!!,"Don't try to fool yourself. This CD sucks. Van Halen definitely lost its way. They hired a Sammy Hagar's clone (Gary Cherone), made an album full of fillers and ugly songs (listen to ""Without You""!!) There's nothing in there that reminds Van Halen. I don't talk about David Lee ROth days, nor Sammy Hagar, but about VH itself, with heart in their songs, great drumming, everything a hard-rock metal band should have. Even when keyboards were added, the band was great. But this VH III is nothing at all. It seems that they got envy from Metallica's ""Reload"" and resolved doing the same stuff!"
3,This is definitely different.,"Although I have to admit that Van Halen's latest album is merely decent, you can't deny Eddie's skill on guitar. In all honesty, this album showcases his greatest guitar work since 1984. The wails on A Year to the Day are incredible, and Without You is pretty impressive. I think the problem is that Eddie is starting to take himself to seriously. There's nothing wrong with being America's premeire party band. That's what made the Roth-era Van Halen so incredible. Eddie managed to combine deep and more intricate music with fun better on For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Nevertheless, you won't regret buying this album."
3,A new VanHalen,"This album is really different, although the voice sounds a lot like Sammy's. The album is extremely deep, much like RadioHead's OK computer. You'll have to listen to this one 5 to 10 times before you get it; it's thick to say the least. I think the music has a lot more to it than ever before, but some of the lyrics are too serious, and come off a little silly. This is the same band that said, ""no no no no, don't take them off, leave them on"", so I don't think ""philosophical rhetoric"" is ever going to work for them. Anyway, I think it's an interesting new sound, and was needed. The Sammy sound was dated and dried up anyway. I don't think a new Sammy/VH album would have worked anyway. I'm interested to see what comes next."
3,Gary's performance has ruined my all-time favorite band.,"The Van Halen Brothers have always had an intersting sound. David brought glitter to their music. Sammy brought polish, experience and heart. Gary has brought them mediocrity and mush-mouth vocals.If VH makes another CD with this guy, they may acheive all the success that Xtreem now enjoys. I will not be that buyer that I have been for years. BRING SAMMY BACK or loose my money!"
3,Will shine in the long run...,VHIII is an album that like Fair Warning I think will shine in the long run. It is not an album to knock you of of your feet but every band has a right to experiment. Gary did try to hard to stretch the vocals but whose to say that is Eddie's fault? One day this album will rise and be more appreciated in my opinion.
1,No Ripper Owen or Steve Augery here!,"Who's this guy trying to sound like, COOKIE MONSTER or Sammy Hager??Surely, Eddie and the rest of guys in the band did not know what really 'hit them'when Sammy left the band,so in come's Gary making a mess of himself and the band and not surprisingly quit the band just after V.H3.We all know V.H members(expecially guitar god Eddie) suffer from eternal P.M.S... so come on guys... Work things out between Sammy or David and let's let the Ledgend continue!!!..."
1,Why?,"After I had enjoyed EVERY other record they made, I bought this one. Can someone tell me what they were thinking? I notice there hasn't been a full recording of new material since. Maybe the creativity pool is empty. I hope not. I'd love to hear from one of my favorite bands again. Hagar, DLR, or anyone. Just make it sound good."
1,Rubbish,"The only reason why I gave this album 1 star was because it wouldn't give me the option to put ZERO in. Van Halen sucks now and has sinced Dave left, Extreme sucks and so does the singer of Extreme who replaced corny Sammy Hagar. If you're even thinking of buying this album-DON'T!! Van Halen should've just retired instead of doing this. It's really embarrasing to the VH name."
1,"Sounds a bit ""Extreme""","An open letter to the Van Halen brothers:Guys, one thing you must realize is that while you may want to ""expand"" your musical horizons it is alright to do so if you do not try to market it as Van Halen. Oh sure we understand that it is your last name and you have every right to label your music as such. Much the same way that Coca Cola owns Sprite, so they have every right to market Sprite in a Coca Cola bottle.This album is the ""Extreme"" using the Van Halen name. The songs have no direction and Gary's vocals, true to form, have no style. This might be a bit amusing if they were poking fun at themselves but they aren't and it's not. Summary: A sad statement from one of the true legendary rock and roll bands"
4,"Good massage oil, good price","This oil gives you a reasonable amount for the price --- many are very small amounts for about the same price. The scent is good, not too strong or overpowering."
5,"WOW!!!!!!!!!! , YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED","While at college, My roommate and I worn down the stereo needles listening to "" The Romatics (1st album), National Breakout, Strickly Personal and In Heat."" This album (CD for you kids)is about redemption and respect. The Romantics put a collection of tracks together that will not disappointment the listener. They really did it right this time with their song selection, writing and personnel. The songs will immediately grab a Romantics fan from the start. You don't have to be a Romantics junkie to enjoy this one, you just need to know great music when you hear it."
1,A superficial book - at best!,"This book is little more than a rehashing of other works written by someone who apparently thinks she has something special to offer - she does not! While her book does offer some practical post rape advice, the safety and self defense sections are full of errors; it reads like someone who took a few classes but lacks the voice of real experience. Her self defense advice reads like pseudo-feminist exercise lessons. No where does she even address the intensity of fear or how violent real attacks can be, or even the most basic martial concepts of speed and power - the might and force it takes to repel or incapacitate a comitted attacker. All in all, Wiseman's book has a juvenille, rich girl feeling - certainly not grounded in streetwise reality. My best advice to her is to stay on the pretty college campuses - and stay off the mean streets."
5,A great all round book for aquatic plants,"This is a very good all round book for aquatic plants from the substrata , to light requirments etc etc. This book even give basic gardening requirments and arranging to have a healthy and attractice garden in your aquarium ."
3,Title is Misleading,"If you're just starting a planted tank this book is for you. There is a lot of general information but not as much advanced info as I would have liked. It would have been nice to see a better breakdown of specific tank types ( Dutch, Amano, etc ), and the equipment and fertilization schedules used. All in all it does contain quite a bit of useful information for the beginner to novice aquarist. To call it an encyclopedia of any sort is a huge stretch."
5,Michelle Malone is awesome in person as well,"This CD shows Michelle's TRUE talent. You will not be dissapointed!!! Get the CD.... and listen over and over (though, I don't think you'd have a choice once you own it)"
4,Good value for light entertainment,"These three BHC movies were technically transferred very well to DVD, both visual and audio, and it was a pleasure to watch them. Good value for money."
4,Axle is the Man!!,"I love this trilogy. Although, I didn't think two was as good as one, three redeemed it. This is definetely a must have for comedy lovers."
4,Great Trilogy,What can I say.. They are really fun movies to own I love it! The came swiftly/promptly.Thanks again!word.
3,the first one is great!..the rest are..:(,the first BHC is really fun!...the sequels are just kinda so-so.
3,1st 100 pgs awesome,"The 1st 100 pages or so of this book were terrific. The book really crackles and the story moves along at a steady well timed pace. Then something just happened, like the story got bogged down in itself or something. I found myself skipping pages to get it over with. Overall an OK book"
3,An admirable failure,"Perhaps because I read this book immediately after reading John Irving's ""A WIdow for One Year,"" I found its central motif rather tiresome: the death of one's child, as literary theme, goes back to the MIddle English ""Pearl"" and beyond, but I wonder if it has not become, like the Holocaust, a facile means for artists to inject rather than create serious thematic content in their works. Richard Ford's ""The Sportswriter"" is another example of this tendency, while Raymond Carver, in his long short story ""Bread,"" refuses to let the death of a child motif subsitute for artistic alchemy.That said, Lisa Zeidner's books is a wonderful read; her heroine Claire is a compelling, authentic voice. She is more interesting than the book lets her be, so to speak. The cover photo on the paperback edition isn't bad, either."
4,Works exactly as expected,"We bought this to use on an electronics workbench; ""real"" magnetic boards for such start at about three times this price. The unit did exactly what we asked it to: collected screws and other parts. Don't put it down because it's a toy; you can save yourself and your electronics hobbyist a ton of money by buying and using this."
4,great product,"this is not a perfect set of all the greatest cartoons ever, but there are tons of greats in this collection so take the good ones with the old black and white or non ""classic characters"" on the DVDs. Definately worth buying as part of a set of at least the first 5 golden collections. Worth buying since they aren't making these things anymore."
5,Cowboys for kids!,"I teach a cowboy unit each year to my 2nd grade students but needed something visual that they would enjoy. I bought this DVD and the 1st one. The kids loved them and the information was fun! These are great and I will use them each year. The music is catchy, too. This DVD is perfect for kids!"
1,NOT for ASL Students,"As a student of American Sign Language (ASL), I have successfully used Flodin's earlier book, ""Signing Illustrated: The Complete Learning Guide,"" as a favorite reference through two semesters of the basics. I would, however, withhold any recommendation of ""Signing Everyday Phrases"" to a student of ASL.ASL is recognized as a true language and as such has its own specific syntax. ""Signing Everyday Phrases"" is an offering in Signed English which presents a different word order from ASL and uses many more signs to convey the same meaning.Since this book is about putting signed words together to form phrases and short sentences and appropriate syntax is a must in ASL, this book is definitely not for the student of ASL."
5,Signing Everyday Phrases,I would recommend this book to anyone who has interest in entering the world of sign language. I learn so much more from this book than I did in a 6 week course that I took. You learn everyday words and fillers so that your able to actually carry on a conversation. It's a great feeling. I hope that you enjoy the book as much as I do.
5,Simply amazing,"Wow,Minnie Driver isn't only an accomplished actress;she is a amazing singer too!Her voice is soft and sensous yet powerful. The songs are wonderfully evocative and they make you feel lost in time.Favourite tracks include""Invisible Girl"",""Hungry Heart"" and ""Home"".Some of the songs may be a tad too slow for some,but they would appeal to most.Well,this is a very personal album and I really admire Minnie's talent in penning all the songs by herself.But this album and listen to great music!"
4,Minnie's First,This is the debut album of film and tv star Minnie Driver. I am a fan of her as an actress and was very pleasently surprised by her musical ablities. Minnie is a very good singer indeed. I highly recommend this CD-you will be very pleased by her performance.
3,Cute but missing some things.,"I picked this backpack because it looked a little different and had a laptop sleeve. My laptop does fit, I have a gateway portable, but it doesn't leave you much more room for books. I carry two books and three notebooks at most and it is hard to get things in and out. It also does not have adequate storage for pens and differnt things like that. There is one zippered compartment in the inside for change and that type of thing but the other interior compartments are open and my stuff falls out. I think that this would be good for a carrying your stuff while your hanging out downtown or something, going on a day trip, etc. but not necessarily as a primary backpack for school where you'll carry several books/notebooks etc."
4,Cute bag but my computer didn't fit in the sleeve,"This bag is really cute. I got the pink one. I bought it partly because it had a sleeve to put your laptop in, however mine didn't fit. I have a ibm thinkpad. Although the computer didn't fit in, it is cool because I keep papers in the sleeve. Also, it fits 2 books in the middle pocket. Another odd aspect of the bag is that the pencil compartment is in the middle pocket. It makes it a little hard to get to. It is nice because the shoulder straps are padded so it doesn't hurt your back. It's also nice because it is not overly big. Oh yeah, the water bottle pockets are a good feature too. All in all, I like the bag."
5,Unbelievably Powerful!!,"This is one of the best studies I have ever done. It is a must do for every believer and it will change how you view what Christ did for us and continues to do today. There are layers of depth of meaning here, so I would suggest going over it more than once or getting a group together to discuss your findings."
2,Burnt out,"It was great while it lasted in the Houston heat-- until I forgot to turn it off when I left my office one evening. Next morning, it didn't work. The warranty had a notice that the warranty was void if the cushion was left on for more than 12 hours. Seems to me a single timing chip that costs less than a dollar would have avoided the problem."
3,Its only so-so,I desperately needed a seat cooler more then heater but got both in one to save my money when winter hits. However the seat cooler is only fair. It takes too long to actually get going and by that time your air conditioning is as cold as it gets and the seat doesnt even give a general cooling. You can feel the coils being cold and the rest of the area still warm. Overall I'd say its worth it but dont expect it to be like a stock factory installed seat cooler/warmer
4,Great Toy,"All the little kids in our neighborhood (9 months-4 years old) LOVE this car! It is a bit loud, but it doesn't bother me really. It is really simple for little ones to use, and cool enough for older ones to still like it. My three-year-old son loves it!"
5,10th Anniversary Putumayo Childrens songs,Wonderful Collection! Memorable music. My grandchildren (4 & 13 yrs) choosethis CD to listen to. It's important that they are being exposed to world cultures through music.
1,Poor Scans,I was VERY disappointed with the Kindle version of the text. The charts would be wonderful if they were readable. The scans are low quality and pixilate when they are expanded to full screen view.
4,Wonderful resource,I had to have this book for an Old Testament course and ended up keeping it for my personal library. It is very resourceful and offers up to date information about locations and sites.
2,"come on Les, we want to hear more.",Les Brown had some great info for the time but it's 1999 and only 2.5 months until the yaer 2000. I want to hear more from this guy .
1,Lack of Photographic content,"I was very disappointed in this book. It has little to do with ""Photo"" in Photoshop. The first 75 pages are on drop shadows and type effects. Only 25 pages devoted to working with photo techniques. The other 200 pages are devoted to Text effects, illustrating, and web page effects. Adobe offers Illustrator and Pagemaker for these purposes .It is difficult to duplicate his effects without a CD containing the images that he uses."
4,A Decent Mage companion,"Despite the complaints of some of the other reviewers, the Mage system is not complex - it is only slightly more difficult than anything else. However, as far as WoD: Sorcerer goes, not every spellcaster in the WOD can act as a Mage - that is, not everyone can bend reality at a whim. The Sorcerer book discusses the rigid paths of magic studied by mortals. While it does not take into account new canon (see Sorcerer:Revised), it's systems are more simplified than the new Sorcerer book, and in addition, lists a /great/ deal of Rituals. Anyone that wishes to run a game based around dark and gritty magic (something to the effect of Call of Cthulu magic), ought to pick up this book. /Don't/ buy this book just because ""Mage hurt my wittle head""."
1,Passable at best,I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is not as good as the other reviewers will have you believe. The main characters were not an emotional attractive couple. I was more interested in the secondary characters of Marcus and the mysterious secretary. Luckily I rented this book from the library and did not have to waste my money.
4,Delicious entertainment,"Dear Reader,Only one word can describe this wonderfully comedic tale by Mr. Ludlum and that word is ""DELICIOUS."" I can't put this book down! Admittedly, the book starts off slow, but I can see that was just too build his the zany charactors and wacky premise. Once those elements have been established the ""fun"" begins. And I do mean fun. Like bumper cars in an amusement park the action is non-stop and the suspense of ""what's next"" is building like a crescendo. Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say give this novel a chance. If your a first time reader to Ludlum as myself, you too will be pleasantly surprized with the investment you put into this one. Delicious!"
1,Unbelievable,"How can someone write a book on Maryland in the Civil War and not mention Antietam, Monocacy or pretty much anything else usually associated with the War? Here's how - by writing a book about how pure and free Maryland was oppressed by the mean old Federal Gummint. This is unreconstructed southern revisionism at its worst. Don't waste your money!"
5,I Seem To Be A Verb,"I Seem To Be A Verb is one of if not the most important book I have ever read. The author's perspective about my inner self gave me a new outlook on life at a time when I really needed it. I recommend this book for anyone who takes themselves too seriously, or is immature, or needs a new outlook on life. It sure helped me."
4,good product,"I bought this present as a gift for my girlfriend. She liked it alot. The reason i bought this one was because it is smaller than the others offered, which is nice when you have a smaller person it is going on. I would recommend this product."
4,Anestethic Numbing Spray,"I have been using this numbing spray for a long time for at-home bikini waxing (brazilian). This product will not take away all of your pain, but it will definitely take the edge off and reduces the sting just like in the description.I do not know what the effect would be on other areas of the body, since I've only used the spray on my privates. I wax or depilate other body parts without any pain relief.The smell of this product is very nice it's very easy to apply.Don't buy this if you're expecting a completely pain free hair removal after using this product. But there is a huge difference between not using any numbing product and using this spray. I would not wax without it."
3,Good enough,"It numbs a bit, so the pain when epilating would not be so severe, but there's still a great deal of pain left."
1,Horrible !,"I had high hopes to save a bit of money and wax my bikini myself... what a mistake !I applied this thing a first time, waited as indicated for 2/3 min, cleaned the extra grease so that the wax would stick properly. Not only did it hurt AS HELL but on top of that the wax got stuck because of the consistency (!!).I applied some after waxing as also indicated, in order to alleviate the pain, but an ibuprofen was actually better. I tried another 3/4 times and it was each time the same.Don't spend your money !"
4,Works pretty well,"Better than using nothing. It does not make the pain go away, but it does lessen it! I use it when I use Gigi hard Brazilian wax, so as long as I use the base oil with this spray, I'm not in agony."
1,doesnt work!,This spray is useless! it just makes the area oily and harder to wax! does not numb any pain! useless product
2,humm. . .,"wow, i was expecting a whole lot more from this album. i LOVED LOVED LOVED (!!!!!) drunk enough to dance, and i was expecting l lot more of that good stuff. but when i heard the songs on hangover you don't deserve, i was shocked! i personally liked the fact that they didn't write all of their songs about love on drunk enough to dance. yeah, thay had their share of love songs, but they added a fun twist! no more fun twists. the new bowling for soup is not the one i knew and loved. they've hit hollywood big time. goodbye quarky group with an unforgetable name, and hello stupid and pointless lyrics. i will never feel the same way about bowling for soup."
5,A Hangover you don't deserve,"Wow, I have some stuff to say about this album that is both good and bad.This is an amazing album, for starters. If you like pop/rock but don't listen to people like, Marilyn Mason, this is the album for you.It has music that a rock fanatic would like, but someone that likes pop could sing along too.BFS wasn't well known until there infamous ""1985"" song (included on the album) hit radios.1-ALMOST- I love this song! It's my fave and has cool lyrics if you listen closely 5/52-TRUCKER HAT- 5/53-1985- 4/5 (You listen to it so much, you like, mesmorize the song)4-GET HAPPY- 5/55-OHIO- 5/56-RIDICULOUS- 4/57-SHUT UP AND SMILE- 5/58-LAST CALL CASUALTY- 5/5and so on and so forth.What I'm trying to say is, this album is amazing and I highly recommend it. It never gets old and is just plain awesome!"
1,At least Jeff Buckley was singing in tune,"I enjoy classical, jazz and pop, etc... music pretty much equally. Quality is what counts, and is essentially what's missing in this album. ""Grace"" is just out of tune and has lost of its grace at the same time. Clearly someone is in need of extra song writer royalty money... Enough said, this is best avoided..."
1,Poor quality sound & did not state Explicit Lyrics.,"This CD has a very poor quality sound (even on my nice surround sound system) and I later found on the back BMG music, so it was purchased through there instead of a better qaulity music dealer.I also ordered it on-line to specifically purchase this CD without the Explicit lyrics, but this CD does contain explicit lyrics, even though it is not stated on the cover of the CD.I e-mailed the seller back about my disappointment, but never received a reply."
5,Totally Origianal CD!!!,"From now on, I'm listening to Gwen Stefani...instead of poor drunk and problemed Britany Spears. Wow- Gwen beats Britany by a long shot! I haven't heard music this original in a long time!!! Gwen has a very unique music style with upbeat rhythems. Not sure what the whole Bananas theme is with the song Hollaback Girl, but it's my favorite song by her! I love her clothing line 2! Gr8 job, Gwen- U R totally creative and original!!!"
5,Definitely new and different,I wasn't sure what to expect from this album... I was pretty sure it wouldn't be very close to the typical No Doubt albums b/c its just Gwen... without the opinions of 3 other boys...So I popped it in... and was pleasantly surprised... I love it! I love how she stepped out of what was comfortable for her in the band and did new things... but still had the same writing sensibility as she did with the NO Doubt album... I highly recommend it... but be prepared for something new different and completely dancable...
3,"Not quite there, needs Strong's numbers and Greek and Hebrew","Great start for the new ESV. But, I was hoping with the excellent New Testament Reverse Interlinear that the whole package would be there. Unfortunately, its not. This is NOT an exhaustive concordance. You cannot reference anything to the original language or to Strong's numbers.ESV cannot be a serious study bible without an exhaustive concordance."
4,Good For What It Is (Not Exhaustive),"This is just what it says it is, a comprehensive concordance. At the time of purchase I didn't know the difference between ""comprehensive"" and ""exhaustive."" With that being said, if you're a bible student this (probably) won't be very beneficial to you. It only shows you the occurrences of the english translated word and does not have Strong's numbers or Hebrew/Greek definitions."
4,Valuable message,"This book is about one man, but touches us all. If you have questions about chemicals and their affect on your body then I suggest you read this book."
1,Unbelievable,"I have to ditto Coffeegurl. I couldn't believe this was a story written by Jude, Jude who has made me laugh and cry. This book made me want to scream: ""Okay??? So???"" I kept waiting for the story to open up. It's hard for me to believe this one made to the printing press. For now I'll just go back and reread Return to Summerhouse."
2,Not one of her best!!!!,This book was very boring and I read a couple of books inbetween this one. Had a very hard time finishing it. It was almost as if it had been written by someone other than Jude Deveraux.
2,"What a shame, I love Deveraux!","I began reading Romance in 1978 with Jennifer Blake. Jude Deveraux was the next writer I tried. I was hooked BECAUSE of these two Authors (plus Johanna Lindsey). For Twenty-Two and a Half years I have read EVERYTHING any of the three have written. Deveraux should never have McNaught- erized her writing. It was GREAT already. As soon as she changed her style, her books suffered. I never finished Emily's Angel. The story was good but it was the worst book I ever read! Well...NOT as BAD as Cassie Edwards! NOBODY is that BAD, ""MY LOVE"",. I would love to read a Deveraux book written like her early stuff. I think that she is THE best Author I ever Read (before she tried to change). McNaught,Coulter,Lindsey,Robards,Blake,Roberts, are some of my favorites. Ms. Deveraux, please, Take this as it's intended...go back to , so called ""little girl sentences"" , etc. I LOVE your writing and if I could would do it myself."
1,Where's the editor?,"My question isn't, ""What's happened to Ms. Deveraux?"", it's ""What's happened to her editor?"" She's one of my all-time favorite authors, but reading her last few books has been like watching a train wreck you were powerless to prevent. The ideas are there; the stories have the potential for magic, but apparently her publisher has decided that once you reach a certain level of success, you no longer need editing. (Judith McNaught seems to be suffering from the same syndrome.) Please editors, help restore the voices of these once fabulous authors!"
4,"This was a good story,but it could have been better.","I have read every one of Jude Deveroux's books and I love them all. This one had a good story, but the ending moved way too quickly. I loved the ghosts and angels. But what was with her having a brother on pg 45 (when they were going to ride the ferris wheel) and then she had ""no siblings"" on pg 100? I still loved it though!"
5,Charming,"I loved this book. The story behind it was unique, and it's not your run of the mill romance. The twists and turns through out the story will keep you reading. The story is best described as a ficticious mystery with a romantic twist."
4,"With a name like Oneida, it has to be good","Sturdily built of a good thick stainless steel, and the silicone rings are great for gripping to get the lids off. Despite that, the shaker cap was a pretty stuck on when I received it, but inverting the lid on the shaker, putting a small screwdriver through the center strainer hole, and tapping the screwdriver with a hammer got the cap off. My only complaint is it could be a bit larger, but it's good for two drinks at a time, at least."
1,Overpriced,"This item is overpriced, especially once you add in the outrageous shipping charges. Find it elsewhere for nearly half the price."
1,DVD didn't work at all,I ordered the 3 pack Jack Ryan and the DVD never did work. It was a total waste of money and I threw it way. Poor choice on my part. I was quite disappointed.
3,No packing slip and poor packaging.,Product came in without a packing slip and very little packaging material. At least there was no damage. I'm still waiting on a packing slip to show up after sending an email about a week ago.
1,Why did they cut the narration?,"I love the show, and I was quite excited to get it on DVD. The only problem is that ALL narration has been cut! Anthony Call is still listed as the narrator, but the entire narration track is missing!If you enjoy the show, contact Timeless Media Group at 1-800-547-6014 and let them know the mistake they've made!"
5,just be sure to get fixed *narration* version SPOOKY great entertainment,"hi...well i've only seen the two seperate episodes i've found before ~ but i found out i can get the whole series ~this stuff creeps me out and ultimately scares me more than any horror movie...well i can't necessarily judge the whole series from two episodes, but if it's along the same lines it is imperative i acquire the rest of these.JUST BE SURE IT'S WITH THE RED A AND NOT THE YELLOW A ON THE PACKAGE ~ MAKE SURE IT'S THE FIXEDVERSION THERE WAS A VERSION WITHOUT THE NARRATION THEY FIXED IT *~the correct version with narration is the more recent one not sure i think the other one was around 2003"
1,they are lucky to even get 1 star,"A haunting, my favorite show. I was so happy when it got here. Then there is No narrorator. These are defective. Don't you think by know they would know Not to sell these versions?"
5,Holds Up To A TougherThanNails Kid,"We bought my then 3-yr old grandson this jeep for Christmas, to replace another power wheels he had grown out of (that by the way, still works great but he is too big for it now) It has now been almost a year and this jeep is still working great -- we live on a couple acres of hilly, mountainous land and this jeep battery never runs down -- we will replace it this year again, only because my child has worn this toy slap out! It is faded, some external pieces are broken, and just now the reverse is starting to not work all the time -- but the original battery is still strong and holds up to an all-day ride. ** There is ONE thing i would change if i could: the tires have NO traction at all and that becomes an occasional problem in my hilly yard."
5,Unbelievable,"This book is truly unbelivable. The poetry is straight from the heart and any one who reads this book will see the authenticity of each poem. With poems like ""Mind Stimulation"" that speaks about the realities of like to poems ""When I Look Into Your Eyes"" which is about chasing after a girl, David Mclean gives you a range of poems that are emotional and can be deeply felt by everyone. Thank you David Mclean for such a well written book of poetry."
1,Never held a charge,"I purchased the Powerex charger and four batteries.The batteries never would charge.I Tried draining the batteries, I tried letting them charge for several days, but they simply would not hold a charge.I still use the charger for my other rechargeables, and it works great.After reading so much about these batteries, i was highly dissapointed!"
2,I used to swear by Powerex now I swear at Powerex,"Based on technical reviews I read years ago that showed Powerex superior to most other brands I have used them for years. However, over time I noticed a lot of duds with new purchases. I guess quality control is not up to par.I can no longer recommend Powerex batteries."
1,Average at best,"I bought 8 of these to use in 2 pieces of work equipment. Each unit uses 4 batteries in series to bring the voltage up to about 5 volts. Using 3 different chargers to see if it made a difference, I couldn't get these to last more than about 3 1/2 hours. I then tried Sanyo eneloop batteries that are rated at 2000 mAh and they lasted 4 1/2 hours. If these actually provide 2700 mAh, then they do so while dropping in voltage to a point that equipment that requires the batteries to be near full voltage won't work for very long.Since rechargeables are supposed to remain at near their rated voltage for most of a charge (in this case 2700 mAh), I think these batteries are low quality. Since this happened with two different sets of 4 batteries, I don't think I just got unlucky and got a bad battery.Due to the expectation of high quality, and the high price, I justify 1 star for their performance."
1,Powerex 2700 mAh AA bateries,"It may have been a bad batch I got but I have had 9 of the 2700 mAh double A's go bad in about one year.Perhaps not a real expensive item, but they should give a useful life of 2 years at the very least.I am not a happy customer and will seek another vendor even though the batteries are probably made at the same factory with all other vendors.Caution!!!"
3,Nice concept but...,"These are very pretty shapes, but the quality of this product is sub-par. Not the sharpest cutters, nor the sturdiest."
5,... just like I read it!,"I couldn't wait to try them to see if they were as good as other reviews said. They are so great! First try was with my 9-year old daughter that just .... love them! She is very skinny and making her eat simple bread and cheese was a challenge.After we started cutting flower-shaped bread and cheese, she hasn't stop eating them! Good trick to increase appetite in our younger guests..."
4,Steel Head Basics and more,"If you are new to steelhead fishng, this is a GREAT video to start with, the guy knows his stuff and covers everything although some of the information is a bit dated. What do you expect, it's an older guy who is a great fisherman and has been using some of the same equipment for many years and it works. Even if you are more experienced it offers a rock solid base of information from equipment to rigging, actual fishing, filleting techniques, curing baits and more and will make a great reference for your video library."
3,"Or more aptly, a Brief History of Some Catholics in America","My interest in reading this book was to get a better understanding of the Roman Catholic ethos in America. Fisher does a decent job of giving the broad outline of Catholic beginnings in the United States. He alternates throughout the first three chapters by giving equal time to the early French, Spanish, and Irish experience. He then shifts to focus on the more established immigrant church and the then seemingly tension of being Catholic and American. Fisher then moves into contemporary times and highlights the lives of several Catholic social players including Dorothy Day, Ceasar Chavez, and several other various social reform movements.The book was decent insofar that is a brief survey of the experience and social conscience of some segments of Catholicism in America. I think Fisher's historical brush could have been more inclusive to the conservative elements of Catholic social life."
4,good dual purpose,Optics are really good. Captures light well. Zooming from 10 to 22X is easy. I would recommend these. They are a little heavy.
3,Strong lens but blurry and heavy,"The lens are powerful but are somewhat blurry. Also, this is quite heavy and not for prolonged use."
5,Inspirational Dance Dream.,"The Dance Futures series, is one of the most inspirational series that I have read in a long time. I found the plight of Tori and her dreams of becoming a dancer throughtout many hardships a welcome change. I do not want to ruin the story, so I will not elaborate further. Honestly though, I am 25 years old and I am still rereading the series."
1,Stay Away,"For the price of this cable, you can get a Monster Cable cheaper, that is a little shorter in length, but far better. I had this cable, and the picture was no where near the monster cable, plus it broke if just a few months. Even though the Monster cable is the lower end of their line, it still is much better."
1,TOO TINY,"Actual pc is 1/8th the screen shot, you need a maginifying glass to read it, if I had had a return slip I would have returned it!"
5,My new favorite author,"Well, I'll admit that I discovered Brendan Dubois by buying his previous two books on the $1.66 rack at Target. I purchased them because of the price, the covers, and a predicted blizzard weekend. I couldn't believe what a bargain I got. They were absolutely the most fabulous books I've read in a while. Shattered Shell was wonderful. If you need a summary, you can rely on the previous posts. If you are looking for a new author to read, then I recommend all of Dubois' books. Please keep up the work."
5,Keep 'em coming!!!,"OK, I'm an addict. Brendan DuBois has again captured my attention and kept me guessing. The latest in the Lewis Cole adventures is full of action and rich with descriptions that made my bones ache from the cold of a New England winter just by reading. I love his characters, particularly because they aren't typical perfect heros/heroines ... how could you empathize with perfection? I feel like I'm getting to know each of them more with every book, and I've read them all. Dead Sand introduced us, Black Tide gave me more insight particularly to Lewis and Felix, and Shattered Shell made Diane very real. Real characters that I would love to meet (all right, I'm developing a thing for Felix, but then I've always liked a ""bad boy""), and plots that make me pay attention to every detail while I try to solve the puzzle. I seldom do, but isn't that what mysteries should be all about. All I can say is keep 'em coming!!!"
4,Great Find!,"I started using this product about a year ago and discovered that it was an excellent natural hair conditioner.In fact it's probably the best conditioner I,ve ever used.Ironically this product has been discontinued by Pro-Line.Needless to say I set out to find as much of this product on the shelves as I could,not much luck until I checked Amazon. I was able to stock up, thanks to Amazon I found a supplier that carried all three Barber Select Pro-Line Products at a great price."
5,Vivid novella of the French Revolution,"Celie's grief turns to fury when a co-worker tells her that while her baby son was dying from causes unknown, the friend with whom Celie left him was in bed with her lover. Celie has already suffered widowhood, and she has no other children - her infant's death leaves her quite alone. So as Paris moves toward revolution, and her wealthy employer struggles to keep her own friends safe from the growing and every shifting hysteria, Celie plots vengeance against Amandine and Georges, the man identified to her as Amandine's lover.This Anne Perry novella works beautifully despite its confined format. The characters spring to life, and their time and place comes through vividly. The signature Perry ""twist"" is heart lifting, and this reader came away amazed that such a profoundly sad subject could be used to provide such a powerful affirmation of both life and decency.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner ""Regs"""
4,A charming story...,"I ALWAYS enjoy what Anne Perry writes; This was no exception. The French Revolution setting and short story format made A DISH TAKEN COLD different from the William Monk and Thomas Pitt novels. However, Anne Perry's ability to show us something about people --- often about ourselves --- captures the reader with the historicity of another time while teaching moral lessons that apply today. I recommend this book for an entertaining, though provoking afternoon's reading, but I must add that I prefer the full length novels, including the Christmas series."
2,Lots of crap installed; XP Home Media Center creates problems; no HP says no warranty with clean install of XP Pro,"There is a lot of crap (various software trials) that are difficult to purge from this pre-loaded computer.HP phone support told me that they don't want buyers putting XP Pro (clean install) onto the machine. In fact, it voids the warranty. Further, HP doesn't provide drivers for Ethernet and other hardware - practically nothing is available on the downloads portion of their website for this machine.XP Media Center doesn't work with Palm Pilots.(By the way, if you want to do a clean install anyway, to avoid the blue Stop screen, first change the file structure to IDE.)"
1,Poorly built,"Purchased this for my 5 year old son so he would stop with the couch. The frame warps if you step on the side so it isn't level and flat and results in an unsafe surface to jump on. Also, one of the legs won't stay screwed. I think the leg is stripped and it came that way. I am now past the return policy so I can't return it.I do like the jumping surface and the fact that it is springless. If it weren't for the frame issue I would have given 4 stars."
1,Hard,"Got this to add to the playroom and its still in pieces...very hard to put together. My husband is deployed and why did I think I could do this myself, lol. The directions say you need 2-3 adults...terrible purchase."
2,"Hard set up, cheap product",You need three men to put this item together. There is no way u can do it with less than that. After a couple of uses it looks like its falling apart!
4,Child safe trampoline,"We have had this a couple of years now. If you want to know about long term durability our is still operable. We got this for rainy days when our kids needed to expend some pent up energy. They did tear the blue cover early on. But it didn't really affect the use of the trampoline. In the past year my children have figured out how to unscrew the legs. So if you have bright AND bored children, just be aware. My children have also used the trampoline as a slide by setting it on an angle, which has slightly bent the frame. So eighty pounds (2 small children) at an angle bent the frame slightly. But again it doesn't affect the use of the trampoline as its very slight. Overall I would purchase again because it's been pretty durable with my 3 children being ROUGH with it."
2,not worth it,"This trampoline was easy to put together. However, the first time my 9 year old jumped on it, the frame warped. This a total waste of money."
3,Decent...but not a good idea for a child with pica,"I ordered this trampoline for my 8 year old son who has autism and pica (he eats weird stuff for those who don't understand what pica is). Within 3 hours, he had peeled off the blue part of the trampoline and was snacking on it. The base structure is very sound...holding up well to his jumping on it, but the blue part had to go and go quickly. One plus to this is that the structure that holds the jumping mat to the frame isn't springs, but heavy duty straps...so no pinching even though the safety guard had to be taken off so fast."
3,not the sturdiest,"it broke within a week, but we just straighten the legs out each time and it's usable. my girl loves it, but it's pretty unstable."
3,Mixed review...,"This trampoline was really cheap by comparison so I'm not going to hold it to a high standard. A great thing about it is how quiet it is compared to my old one due to it using nylon/elastic bands around the frame instead of springs. This alone gives it at least three stars in my view. Assembly wasn't too bad either.My main problem with it is the size. It is advertised as being 38 inches and that is simply not the case. The interior dimension of the surface on which you would jump is 31 1/2 inches in diameter. Even the exterior dimension is less than 38 inches (not that it matters. Who the heck really cares about the outer size when shopping for one of these? Lame.Because it is so small I would hardly recommend it, but for the price if you are careful to remain centered then it is passable."
3,Good for the price,"I have had 2 mini tramps in the past with metal springs that broke, so far for the price this seems like a good choice. One warning it is hard to put together."
1,I nearly killed myself!!!!,"Do not buy if you don't have at least two burly friends. Even when you do, they will likely be injured in the making of this trampoline. The pieces don't fit together and the instructions don't help at all!! The box should come with gauze and bandages for your inevitable injury!! We spent half an hour on the first two steps in the instructions. AND FAILED. And we are two college graduates who work out. We considered it an accomplishment to put all the pieces back in the box so we could ship it back to god-foresaken place it came from!!!! Do not buy. This product has ruined my love of trampolines forever.Why can't the pieces just come welded together in a slightly larger box? Then, no injuries would occur. I should be CEO of this company. But if I were, I would just cease production on these trampolines."
3,Pretty good for the price,"This trampoline doesn't cost much (which says a lot for the product quality). I ordered the trampoline as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. She enjoys it although she didnt't have to suffer through the process of putting the trampoline together. Some parts came rusted and appeared to be worn or old.However, the trampoline is holding up well and it is still a pretty good gift. I would buy it if youre looking for a temporary trampoline for not a lot of money."
2,"NOT an easy assembly product, requires 3 adults for safe assembly!","Finding this product was wonderful, but when I received it I found 2 huge problems. 1) One person CANNOT put this mini trampoline together alone. It takes 2-3 strong adults! This is not an acceptable situation for me. I'd have to hire people to get this product put together. 2) The trampoline cover is made of extremely poor quality material which feels like it could tear very easily. That would not be a deal breaker for me. I would be willing to buy a better trampoline cover for the price and quality of the trampoline.Amazon needs to point out, right up front that 2-3 adults are required for assembly.They did accept my complaint about ""Not as advertised"" for return and they make it very easy to return products. I'm sure with a re-write of the description, people who don't have to hire assistance will be very happy with this product."
1,not for sustained use by adult,"I used this trampoline for a light cardio workout around 3-4 times a week for about 3 months. After this period, two bands had snapped with others wearing quickly. Not recommended."
2,Tough to assemble,"I expected that the legs would not be on; but I never expected the difficulty I encountered assembling the rails and mat.The instructions have a warning:""3 adults in good physical condition are required for the following assembly. Wear proper shoes and maintain balance to prevent a fall."" Good advice, but there is no way of knowing the problems you can encounter until you get it out of the box and see the assembly instructions.I got the rails and mat together; and it did take 3 adults.I never could get the safety pad to fit.I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Instructions and bolts not included in our shipment.,"My grandson was so excited about getting a trampoline. I had one day shipping. Arrived promptly. Disappointed. There were no instuctions and the bolts were missing. My husband and son tried to find bolts to fit from his tool box.Looked again and again through shipping box but couldn't find any instructions. Contacted helpline. Unable to get through, left message. Decided to return item!"
5,"works fine for balance training, stable",I purchased two trampolines for our rehabilitation center. we primarily use it for balance training purposes. They seem to do the job well enough so far (it's been 2 or 3 weeks).
1,lost Parts,We orderes the trampoline for my granddaughter birthday and the instructions and parts to put it together were missing. Cammed the company and asked them for the missing parts and they will not send them. They want us to send the trampoline back to them. Hell I already paid for it once. They should of checked the box for all the parts before they sent it in the fiset place
1,Should have paid attention to the reviews,"This is impossible to put together. I haven't been able to use it. Thought I was trying out something which might help improve my fitness, but the cheap price and free shipping is useless. Can't put it together. Pay a bit more, or better yet, go to a sportshop and get one that is pre-assembled. Try it out to make sure it will be sturdy and usable. I couldn't do that because I live 50 miles from the nearest such store. Do it, if you want something like this. Don't gamble on a mail order cheapie."
3,Not bad for the price,"I wanted to buy a small trampoline for health purposes, as I read that it is good for the lymphatic system. This trampoline is not nearly as springy as others I have jumped on, as it does not have springs--yet that also makes it safer for my four year old to be around and to jump on. Also, about six months in the blue out part got a small tear in it. So, this is certainly not the best re bounder, but it is affordable and it gets the job done."
2,a mess,while it was easy to put together the part you don't bolt down does not sit flush no matter how you play with it leaving a crooked trampoline that does not look very safe.
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR....,"We did not have any problems putting this together...my kids LOVED it! Only problem, my 5 yr old (46lbs) and my 2 yr old (26lbs) were the only 2 jumping on it and they ONLY jumped 1 at a time. The legs are bending and we've only had it a week or 2. Even if they jumped 2 at a time, which they didn't, they are still under the weight requirement....very disappointed"
5,Terrific writing,"I was refreshingly entertained by each story told in a unique and nostalgic voice. I was reminded of the atrocities of human rights violations that were at the time common place. Very different stories that enables you to make the shift as they are beautifully written with an artistic flair that only our older and long gone authors have been able to accomplish. Words that have never seen the light of day since forever, make their come-back with each few turns of the page. I loved it, but I may be partial to the islands since Hawaii is my on-going love affair. Peace. Kawi."
1,Not a bad shirt... extremely high international shipping rates,"The actual shirt is quite good (a little thinner material than others I have pruchased) and shipping was very fast. However, the international shipping rates charged by Kryptonite Kollectibles are exhorbitant (2-3 times more than others). The t-shirt ended up costing me $60. Needless to say I won't be dealing with Kryptonite again."
3,Nice fantasy story. It kept my interest. Interesting characters and events.,"It is about two opposing fairy groups. They use magic on humans as well as other fairies. Kaye thinks she is a 16 yr old human, and learns that she is really a pixie (fairy) with magic powers. One group of fairies plans to kill her as a sacrifice.Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting current day Philadelphia and New Jersey. Copyright: 2002. Genre: young adult fantasy."
2,Pretty bad....,"This book was less than impressive. The writing style was juvenile, and the story was so choppy.There was excessive swearing, which added little to the story. The violence as described was also unnecessary.Even by the end of the book, you really don't have any reason to like the ""heroine"" of the story, Kaye. You don't like any of her ""friends"" either.The ""hero"" Roiben, although you like him a little better, sounds like a bad actor at a Renn Faire.Maybe it was because I had just finished reading a few books by Charles de Lint. Maybe it was because the book was just bad.If you are looking for urban fairy tales, try de Lint. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
5,Vermont Fan,I am 61 years old and I picked this book up for my niece but the cover intrigued me soo I started to read it. I have read it 6 times icluding the sequel Ironside. I assumed Holly Black was a writer just for kids. Boy was I wrong. She is like J K Rowlings her books are soo well written the are for all generations. Bravo! Ms. Black . I am now reading YA authors that I would have never read before your books and for that I thank you.
1,There are better choices,"If you want to read a terrific tale of faerie unleased on a modern world, read War for the Oaks by Emma Bull. Raymond Feist has another option, but I've forgotten the title. This book is a huge disappointment. I bought it based on a student's recommendation and was heartily dismayed at its sophomoric style and content."
1,How is this young adult?,"Page 9...5 lines down: ""...and your hair is F***ed up.""Amazon listed this book as being ages 13 and up. Publisher's Weekly listed it as ages 12 and up. The back of the book, itself, lists it as ages 14 and up. Now maybe these people don't mind their VERY young adults reading books with such language but I'm hoping that the majority of parents who pay attention to what their kids watch and read do care and avoid this book. We're returning it."
2,"Location, Location.","Neil Gaiman brought European folklore stateside in American Gods, and it worked. But Seelie and Unseelie Courts in New Jersey!?!?! What?!Garden State it may be but Tir na NÓg it is not. And besides, North America has it's own nature spirit traditions. Why do all fairies need to be Gaelic?Leaving aside my other issues with this book (which I am far too lazy to go into,) as far as I'm concerned, if you're going to make a story about Celtic fairies, you really ought to base the story in Ireland or the UK. And if you STILL want to base it in North America you should at least give the reader an explanation as to why they are there!"
1,Barely got through it,"I struggled to get through this book, it was my least favorite faerie/fantasy book I have read so far. It was my first Holly Black book and I don't think I'll be trying any more. The plot is weak, and the romance is actually a little creepy. Isn't he much older than Kay? That was a little weird. I just don't feel like Kay was a character with much depth, and the faerie world is just two dimensional. The writing is elementary - I know this is for young adults but give them a little credit. So many adults are reading YA since the Twilight series - well, this is one you can pass up. Trust me, you're not missing anything."
3,"Great creativity, bad plot","There is no doubt that the author had a very good imagination while developing this story but the plot does not quite live up to the creativity that was put into it. All the book mainly focuses on is the romance between Kaye and another fairie. There is no development with the other parts of the novel, such as explanations of the fairie realm. I would have liked to know more about Kaye's species, the pixies, and how they were respected or disliked in the fairie realm more than just reading about her romantic involvements. Sure a book should have romance but it should not just be focused on that which it kind of was."
3,"Rough writing, good anyway: not for 12-year-olds","""Young Adult"" is an ambiguous category, and this book is not really for 12-year-olds, as stated in one of the press reviews, but truly for the young adult; the protagonist is 15, and the reader should be about that age due to mild sexual content and the glorification of shoplifting and smoking. (Kaye's shoplifting experience helps her save the day: not a nice message.)The writing is amateurish; some passages have misused words and awkward grammar, and I agree with the reviewer who said that some bits are overwritten. Nonetheless, the characters are well drawn, and the descriptions of fairies very evocative, reminding the reader of Rosetti's Goblin Market or Bosch's paintings.As a first novel, it's pretty good. I'm interested in reading some of Black's more recent work. I hope she's gotten herself some more brutal help with editing, as the rough writing is really the only thing standing between ""pretty good"" and ""wow""."
3,"Starts off well, but loses the reader's interest by the end.","I was really excited to read this book; it seemed like a welcome escape from the carbon copy teenage books these days, always the same ditzy teen and her boy problems. It starts with a bang, introducing some truly interesting characters with whom I could connect, even if we had nothing in common. Kaye's description of the world left me constantly wondering if this was set in post-nuclear times or something, but the dark outlook was nevertheless a welcome change. Unfortunately, by the end of the book, I simply wasn't buying it anymore. The wheels essentially came off, leaving a fairly typical and predictable who's-the-mole story. The love story was better than it deserved to be; I found the subplot between Kaye and Roiben more interesting than the actual plot! If this is your genre, then you will probably enjoy this book; if not, pass this one by."
5,Blood stained broken glass,"A modern faerie tale indeed. Welcome to ""Tithe"" written by young Fantasy writer Holly Black (the Spiderwick Chronicles)a book containing Beautiful and angst ridden knights, a fiesty heroine, blood, broken Glass, death, sacrafice and some very evil faeries.Tithe follows the story of Kaye, an ""asian blond"" who, after she returns to her childhood home becomes back in contact with the ""imaginary"" faerie's she befriended as a child. Through these faerie's Kaye gets pulled into the dangerous world of the seelie court where she is forced to participate in the Tithe, a sacrafice held every seven years. Through this Kaye discovers she herself is a not a human, but a green skinned pixie.Black weaves teen ansgt, dangerous love and thrilling adventures with rousing imagery and a thoroughly riviting writing style that keaps you turning the pages way into to night. A young adult urban fantasy that will capture the imagination and spirit of adults and teens alike."
3,Poker game gone wrong!,"Alex McKnight gets invited to a poker game at a private residence and then armed men break in and rob a safe full of money. The owner of the house thinks Alex did it. Chief of Police Maven thinks Alex's bar-owning friends did it. And Alex, thinking that he's clearing his best friend's name, stubbornly goes through all the suspects until he eventually trips on the real architect of the robbery. I like Alex's tenacity, but this adventure, especially the end, gets too unbelievable and convenient. Still it's a good yarn and enjoyable to read. There's something unsatisfying about Hamilton's endings. Things just don't fall into place nicely. However, it's the character of Alex McKnight that is the real draw for me."
5,Super series by a most refreshing writer.,"In Steve Hamilton's fourth novel, ""North of Nowhere"", reluctant PI Alex McKnight continues to become entangled in problems not of his making that compel him back into the detective game. Fate leads Alex to a poker game that ends up in a robbery.While robbery, Canadian organized crime, loan sharking and smuggling engulf Michigan's UP, the ultimate story is about McKnight helping his pal Jackie...human frailties and passions are central to the story.Mr. Hamilton's poetic hard-edged prose rings true as lead after lead never add up for McKnight.The intricate plot has plenty of twists to keep you guessing...nothing is straight forward as events spin out of control.The cast that supports McKnight is powerful and grows in each installment.So whether you prefer plot over characters, or vice versa, this series will hook you."
5,Awesome - cannot stop listening to this!,Marvin - I have been a long time fan of your music and ministry. I appreciate this latest effort and cannot stop listening to it. I know everyone loves Never Would Have Made It but it is clearly not the only blessing on this album - I love it all and thank God for you. Keep up the great work for the Kingdom.
5,Wonderful Worship CD,"He annointed voice,and lyrics ALWAYS move me to worship . .no matter where I am. Wonderful CD!Can't wait for the next CD"
5,Thirsty,This is an outstanding praise and worship CD. I cannot stop listening to these wonderful songs of praise.
5,Get Ready,"I loved this band since I was in high school. This is a good collection with most of the hits, including my favorites ""Celebrate"" and ""Big Brother"""
3,A bit slow but reliable,"It's hard to mess up Kama Sutra Oil because it is what it is. The company took about 2 weeks to send it, though, which left me wondering what's so hard about placing a small bottle into a box and shipping it off? When it got here, I understood because they place a tiny bottle into a huge box filled with paper. That's a waste of space and paper products that the company really needs to put a check on."
2,Image was deceiving,"At the bottom of the page there was a link that said ""Frequently Bought Together"" Then it showed two PC games with two different covers, they ended up being the same product nad cost me shipping and a restocking fee."
5,Can't go wrong here!,"It's the ORIGINAL Looney Tunes (just like we grew up with). What's not to love?!? Great gift for ""Daddy"" from his boys lol."
2,Larry Ferguson made one good movie. This aint it.,"Kay Lenz, former dogqueen of the Movie of the Week genre uglies this thing down to the bargain basement of the sadly missed quality Western. And I love Lance Henricksen but he's just a little too sullen and introspective to make his Frank Morgan character interesting. However, Nikki DeLoach turns in a terrific performance as his long estranged daughter by guess who....the ubiquitous Kay Lenz of course. Gaaak.Too bad you cant Photoshop a movie. Oh well, wish I hadn't bought this. Guess there's usually a good reason why these things go out of print."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Seven's Travels release was the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. This album is amazing...Ant's beats are wicked and Slug's words are genius. You can feel the passion (for whatever that means to whomever is listening) in his voice and you don't want to stop moving through the whole thing. He gives props to Minnesota in his hidden track and, being from there myself, I thought it was kind of cheesy, but in the best way possible! Atmosphere - keep on keepin' on...much love.."
3,Fleeting Moments of Blinding Brilliance...,"Seven's Travels is just not up to par with Atmosphere's releases, before or since. Don't get me wrong, there are a handful of songs on here that are GREAT - including ""Trying to Find a Balance,"" ""In My Continental,"" ""Always Coming Back Home to You,"" and even ""Bird Sings Why The Caged I Know."" The rest of the album is saturated with filler duds and interludes. I have to skip over ""Shoes,"" ""Gotta Lotta Walls,"" ""Liquor Lyles Cool July,"" and ""Good Times."" If you just read the lyrics to ""national disgrace,"" you'd think you were reading eminem lyrics. I really expected more. The whole album is really hit or miss, some of the tracks are very good while a good number of them aren't even worth listening to."
5,Atmosphere is the coolest,"Atmosphere, or what people called him MC Slug, is one of the best rap artist of all time. With his 2002 album ""God Loves Ugly,"" he is working it. For an underground rapper, he is cool. I hope that the MTV or any other television music networks put him on it because he will cause changes to people who loves any type of music.Favorite Songs for ""Seven's Travels""1)Reflections2)Gotta Lotta Walls3)History4)Bird Sings Why The Caged I Know5)Trying To Find A Balance"
3,Good enough,These arrived in a timely fashion. It was obvious by the lack of manufacturers' packaging they weren't brand new. I have had the Motorola phones this came with for less than 2 years and the batteries had been problematic for months before I finally had to replace them. I'm just waiting for my contract to be up before replacing the phones and batteries at a discounted rate.Good Riddance
1,Extremely dissapointing . . .,"I did not like the prequel of this book, ""COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME"", but in a moment of weakness I decided to give this novel a chance, hoping that Ms. Monroe would go back to the promise she showed in ""THE REAL DEAL"". Sadly, I was very dissapointed. The characters are flat, stereotypical, and annoying. They never show trust in one another. Almost up to the last page they are doubting each other's actions and intentions. Ms. Monroe's writing is also annoying because she keeps repeating and rehashing thoughts, emotions, and worse, the events that happened 18 months ago. This shows little respect for the readers' intelligence and tolerance. I won't be giving this author another chance."
1,Pay no attention to those glowing reviews,"Throughout the majority of this book, the heroine keeps some major secrets from the hero with only the slimmest of excuses. Not only this, but she has no problem going to bed with the hero, even though he has a horrible opinion of her. I lost patience with this plot fast, and I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Poor Customer Service,Purchased computer back in Feb 2007 From the first day computer malfunctionedcalled H.P. customer support service. For the last 2.5 months this notebook has been in HP service center waiting for parts. Standard response from service center parts are not available and there is no ETA on when they will become available. You can draw your own conclusions of what I think of HP worldwide warranty. I realize that this is not a review of the product but does have a bearing on the after market support of this item.
2,"Too Soft, Too Chewy!","Was drawn to this product as a result of the ""Claim"" of it being ""All Natural"": Well, it might be 'somewhat natural', except for the 5 GRAMS OF ADDED SUGAR which they tactfully do not display in the 'Ingredients Label' for you to see when one investigates the product prior to purchasing!: In any event, I still could have lived with it for the protein advantages, however, even with the sugar content, the thing does NOT taste decent at all; plus it looks/feels like fake meat; the pieces are JUST TOO SOFT for a 'Jerky'.I will certainly be trying something else!Cheers."
3,"Arrived quickly, but didn't like flavor","We are very big jerky fans and this just didn't do the trick. I agree with the other reviews that this was just too sweet. It did however, contain no msg."
4,Good Stuff!,"This is good Jerky! The Jerky police will not come because the original formula has a sweet taste to it. It is probably their own ""original formula"". The pieces are sized right. I give it a Texas style yeee haw!"
1,"Well, bluntly put.","If you are a fan of peppered beef jerky then you are probably not looking for something sweet. More likely you prefer something spicy. This is not it. I think this is one of the worst tasting peppered beef jerky i have tried. Way to sweet, but if that is what you are looking for, then go for it.Ok, I hated that beef jerky. It was gross. I dont think you will like it. I dont reccomend buying it . Enough said."
2,"I want to like this, but I can't","No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book. So why only two stars? Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and theirSweet N' Spicyflavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste. The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak. You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak. It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes. Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste. I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again."
4,Even better than the teriyaki flavor.,"This brand is properly cut across the grain, so it's fairly easy to eat, and the flavor is distributed through the cuts, rather than sprayed on. It made a pretty good stew meat after long cooking as well, though it had to be broken into small pieces to rehydrate."
2,Not so much,"I have purchased this beef jerkey before and it was very good. This time, the two bags had alot of fat and most of the pieces I couldn't even chew. It's too bad because I used to like it.Thanks"
3,not warm enough,I'm a tad disappointed. I had hoped that the towels would be warmer after being on the rack all night.Will I send it back? Maybe not . It did take the chill off a bit but not to the extent I've experienced in hotels that have them.
1,Parts to attach the legs are insufficient. Wall attachments might work?,"I never actually got the chance to try out the warming part because I purchased this to be used as a stand-alone unit, and I could not get the legs to attach securely (did not try the wall attachments). The leg attachment screws included M6 x 35 were too long. I tried shorter M6x30 screws and they were too short! The attachment consists of a nut welded to the bottom of the rack, so just the TIP of the screw would attach (thus the flimsy at best fit). Even if I had the correct length of screw, it would only be holding on by a few threads. I suppose you could punch a hole in the bottom of the rail, but that may puncture some of the electrical work inside the rail tubing. I returned it."
1,towel warmer,This warmer takes about 1/2 hr to hest up and then the towel doesnt even get very warm. Not worth the money
2,"Looks OK, but doesn't warm towels AT ALL",I've left towels on this thing all night and they're still not warm. I can feel the bar is heating up but not enough to really transfer the heat. This is one of the lowest price towel warmers you can get and i know why- it doesn't warm! Get what you pay for with this one...and less. Very disappointing
3,Towel Warmer,This is the second one I've bought. Both were for my daughters in college. They are great for college dorm rooms. The first one I bought three years ago and it still works great for towels and laundry.
4,towel warmer,This item is doing what I expected it to do. Dries wet towels and keeps them warm. Very happy with it.
3,towel warmer and drying rack,Not bad. Dries towels but does not create hot towels. Good product if you don't want to spend a lot of money. Does not take up a lot of room in a small bathroom.
3,not warm enough,"it works fine, i guess, when it comes to drying thick towels. but we use two towels, and i think this unit isn't warm enough to heat up the towels. you must leave it on all the time as the settings recommend. but unless you're a single person or have two of these, it's not what i'd hoped. still, it does help to dry quickly your small laundry items and wet towels. just not as creature-comfort-cozy as we'd hoped."
4,warm towels,Great as a stand alone. Wall mount cheap and in the way of hung towels.Customer service good in sending replacement parts for cheap wall brackets.
2,Not a good item,This item just does not do it. Towels do not get warm. Extremely dissatisfied. Would not recomend this item. Wish now that I had done more reasearch on the item.
1,Week LEDs Make for a Dim Flashlight,"This flashlight isn't a horrible flashlight. However, with 32 LEDs, I was expecting a pretty powerful beam. Rather, these 32 LEDs put out about the comparative beam of my Mag Flashlight with a single Luxeon LED. Very disappointing."
1,Old-fashioned and hard to use; get the Harper-Collins-Robert,"I am always amazed that the Cassell's French dictionary is still around. It is full of obsolete words and meanings in both French and English, gives sketchy definitions, and is generally hard to use. The Collins-Robert College (0062752537) is infinitely better in every way, and costs the same."
2,Techniques of the Impressionists,I did not like this book. I did not learn anythink new. It was waste of money. I offered artists friends to take it for free. Nobody wanted.
1,nothing new,"another clone of Senses Fail gone horribly wrong.seriously, if you want to listen to twenty-something-year-old ""boys"" that sound like they have castrated themselves, at least listen to the good stuff."
1,uggggh,"if your into this ""new"" genre of post-hardcore, then by all means, run out and buy this cd. however, if you dont like overdone/generic/cliche ridden/false-angst/trendy crap, then this album is NOT for you.seriously, this sucks. dont waste your money. go buy a good album."
4,Great Lesser known album.,"I was a little doubtfull of this album when i heard this guys voice, its a little too whiney.But once i listened to this whole album i realized just how great these guys are.I mean i would pick this album over TBS or Finch or The Used anyday.These guys are also pretty good live.Anyway they have a EP out also...i listened to it and its not to good so i would stick with getting this one instead.Best songs: The song ""My Eyes Burn"" should be worth the money alone.Also ""The Greatest Fall(Of All Time)"" is the only good song off of there Ep and it is also one of the best on here.Also im kind of a sucker for acoustic songs so ""Tiger Lily"" is also one of my favs.Bottom Line:If there is any fan of The Used,Taking Back Sunday,Finch, or any other bands like that i think you would enjoy this release...and also if ur into a different style of music this album isnt as Tenny Bopperish is the other bands floating around nowadays."
2,There's Much Better Out There,"There really isn't much going for this band/cd. The sound is not unique at all and the vocals can be downright irritating (for emo that is, which is pretty bad). I really don't know who would rate this well other than people who haven't heard better emo or are working for the band and writing here to give them a good review. If you like this type of music then of course listen the Taking Back Sundays, Brand News, Senses Fails, etc., but also check out some less popular emo bands like Northstar and Rufio."
1,worst cd ever,This is one of the worst cds I have ever bought. I picked this cd up just to see what it is all about. There are no good songs. I wish I could give this cd no stars. And why do they have all those silent tracks .I mean theres like 70 silent tracks and there are no songs except on the last one what the point of that? This is the worst cd ever.
3,D-Block Presents......Sheek Louch,"The game has been waiting,and waiting....and waiting, but Sheek Mutha ... Louch finally came through with his debut album,""Walk Witt Me"". After blazing the streets with various mixtapes (all block busters) and dishing out straight-to-the-point-metaphorical-street-rhymes, I can really say Sheek has enourmous street credibility, what I can't say though...is that it was worth the wait. Underground hip-hop heads are clearly dissapointed at the rap veteran, for his album was ""ok"" and a couple tracks away from a mediocre performance. The production for this album was extremely good, but its lyrical delivery is far from genius. The album has about 4 to 5 hot tracks, the rest slow-tempoed wanna be deep songs, wich made a poor attempt to capture the audience's ear...this CD is worth buying..but not worth praising."
3,Commitment through Healing,"Shireen Perry's In Sickness and in Health tells of her marriage to Mark, who six months after their marriage, discovered he had AIDS. Through the book, the couple struggle with the compassion and justice of God, the reaction of some church members, and their own love and lifestyle. Though it is a story of love and hope, throughout the book there is a tone of the wife's resentment. It is understandable, but she often complains about her husband, rather than sticking to his symptoms. Perry tells a sensitive story, though sometimes rambling."
5,Loved it.,"The acting in this particular season was amazing. Especially the kid, he deserves an award for this role. Amazing for sure."
5,Excellent show!,It's one of the best shows on tv. Can't wait to see season 5! I hope they showcase Penelope more! She is a crack up!
3,NOT WHAT U THINK,I Agree Some Of The Tracks Are Good But Remember The LP Covers Of These Albums The Pictures Looked Old Or No Picture Of The Group At All.That's Because All Of Those Songs Were Rejects Of The Group And They Were Done Recording With Mercury Records So They Dig Them Out The Can.At Least That's What Charlie Told Me.
3,The pristine headache,"This is my very first computer, bought with my own money, earned from my own sweat and toil. Perhaps then, I am biased when I say that it is definately an excellent and capable little machine for a very reasonable price. HOWEVER, it would have been nice if the motherboard hadn't died after only three weeks. Luckily there is a warrenty and if you can manage to get the computer ownership transferred to your name (if it is a refurbished computer like mine, the company who sells it to you is sypposed to do this) before anything goes wrong, then you might just be able to get it fixed. I'm going through all this as I write. As always, buyer beware."
4,"close, but just misses the mark","i agree with almost all of the comments from those reveiwers who gave this book a five star rating. some additional comments and concerns. i found the selection of photographs poorly chosen, with much unnecessary duplication and many glaring ommissions. i recommend pakula's book 'the last romantic' for a wonderful illustrative selection of photographs. sullivan i feel has a wonderfully page-turning way of writing, he obviously loves his subject. unfortunately, his primary characters lose their appeal for me after the revolution. this i feel is a function not of the writer, but of the inherent dullness of ducky who reveals herself for the self-serving, boring person she must have been when stripped of the alluring background of royalty when ousted from the russian court."
3,You'll either love it or hate it,"This is not a terrible biography, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said the author is way too enamored of his subject to be objective. He's not the best writer in the world, and he does his subject no service by romanticizing; being melodramatic (that title!), and/or speculating about her life and the people who surround her. I recognize that it must be difficult to write a biography of someone who ordered her personal papers destroyed, which must be why Mr. Sullivan indulges in speculation at times. I preferred John Van der Kiste's ""Princess Victoria Melita"" as the better biography of this granddaughter of Queen Victoria; it's a far more balanced biography than Mr. Sullivan's."
1,Muddy colors...very disappointing,The colors are way off...it looks like a before cleaning photo. This painting is grays and blues not browns and tans. I'd return it but it would cost more to do so than I paid for it. I was very disappointed and won't be purchasing anything else from this particular vendor.
1,Go to Walmart,"Very very weak black light, barely lite up two posters I had up on my wall. I should of just went to Walmart in the first place."
5,Great product!,"I love this black light, it looks high quality and durable. The shipment was quick, and the purchase hassle free."
1,"Helps a little, but not much","Basically, I got this to find cat urine. It really is not a big help. You can only use it at night, ant you have to hold it about two INCHES from the suspected urine. I thought that you could hold it like a flashlight maybe two to three feet away. It if wasn't for the strong odor (doesn't work too well on older spots) you would not be able to find them. That is a hassle, plus the fact that you can only use it at night. I have two jobs, and by the time I get home, I'm too tired to go on a microscopic cat pee hunt. It took me 1 1/2 hours for my living room alone! This is the first time that I have used one of these for this purpose. There has got to be a better way!"
2,this product does not have a 6ft power cord,The product description states in no uncertain terms that the light comes with a 6ft power cord. The cord is actually 3.5ft.
1,Terrible,"I bought two of these because of how cheap they are. I also got two 18"" from another company. Let me tell you there is a huge difference in spending 10 more bucks for the 18's. One fixture still works but the second one crapped out on me. I'm an electrician and solving the problem was easy. The switch is actually decent. The ballast is terrible. Its mounted on the front side of the blacklight. The only access point to the black lights are from the sides(two screws) The side the where the ballast is has rivets punched in. Making it impossible to replace!!! Don't buy"
3,Almost worked,"I'm giving this blacklight three stars because when it works, it works great. It lights up small areas just fine, and everything glows and it looks fantastic. The problem is, I used it three times and it stopped working. The light isn't broken, it's the fixture itself that has stopped working."
2,turkey black light,"I bought 2 and 1 worked, asked for a new one, (amazon was great with that) the 2nd one didn't work either then I asked for a refund and got it, there's a cheap part in the black light"
1,Do not buy,"I ordered two of these. Both turned on for a split second and that was it. Very cheaply made. Do not waste you time, you get what you pay for."
1,Damaged...,"Save yourselves from absolute frustration, don't buy this black light. Once I received the product this morning I opened it up only to find that the package was damaged. The black light itself was either damaged as well, or of a poor quality. Not only was the connector cable a insufficient, but the damn on/off switch fell down into the inter workings of the light! Effectively making it impossible to turn on and off. Upon inspection of the bulb itself I found that one end of the bulb was separated from the filaments, which not only made the light work incorrectly but made it an electrical hazard as well."
5,Perfect gift for pirate lovers!,"My son just received this for his 3rd birthday. We had a pirate theme party, so this was a perfect gift. He requests this book EVERY day (sometimes even twice on the same day). It's a super cute story with wonderfully charming pictures to go with it. I really don't mind reading this over and over------neither does my husband. It has some great messages in the story that are very subtle. Now I want to get the sequel---Pirates Don't Change Diapers."
5,I Love Reading This One Aloud,"The kiddos (& their parents) love this one. A boy at the beach encounters pirates, becomes a pirate for a day, and finds he'd rather be a little boy at home. A great book to read aloud - I admit to having a whole lotta fun performing Braid Beard's lines. The illustrations are wonderful as well."
3,Book had ben pages,"I was a little disapointed because the book had all the pages crumpled at the bottom of the book, I have been very satisfied with all my other order I have recived"
5,great book,"this book is a fun read for my 2 and 6 year old grandkids. The illustrations are so awesome, I'mm looking for more books by the illustrator"
5,A Great Book for Scurvy Dog Pirates,"""Pirates have green teeth -- when they have any teeth at all..."" With this first line my 3-year-old son's eyes got huge and he fell in love with this book -- and pirates. It continues to be a favorite. It is a cute story with excellent illustrations. My son loves to yell out: ""Scurvy Dog"", ""Shiver me timbers"" and ""NO TUCKING"" right along as we read the book. It has been the inspiration for much imaginative play. A fun book that I definitely recommend to pirates of all ages!"
2,not very cute,"I bought this book because I read two of her other books ""hex appeal"" and ""hex in the city"" but I found this one was not as cute and the charms weren't as simple. I was looking for cute and simple but unfortunately I didn't find it with this."
5,dracula; the series,A very likeable TV show that I like and also my 8 year old granddaughter loved it. The vampire is the most handsome I've seen so far. It is pretty mild and OK for children. A cute series.
3,A Step Better Than There Second LP,"Your first listen to this album and you'll think Spineshank might've sold out. Roadrunner Records is trying to get more mainstream bands out there today and it seems Spineshank is next inline to have the spot light. If they don't have a song on the latest movie soundtrack then they will most likely have one on a video game. Frankly I think they don't quite have what it takes yet to be mega stars.For starters, a lot of the songs seem to be mellow to me. No, there not all together slow songs, it just seems different from there last two albums. Your first listen through you won't like the album much, trust me, but after a few more listens you will start to like it. All in all, its a tad better than there last."
1,spineshank still sux,"spineshank sux, and their album's become more crap too waste money on. self-destructive pattern isn't even worth a kazaa download, this band just sux."
3,"I don't know.. it doesnt have any ""mood""","As much as i liked the Height of Callousness but this cd did not really ""click""..There are alot of good songs both heavy and soft and the vocalist is great but non of the songs has any ""mood"" or ""rhythm"" in them if you know what i mean..If you like Slipknot you are probably going to like this cd and if you don't, there are some songs for you..My favourite song off the album is Smothered"
3,"Average, they've done better","I was able to listen to it, but I can't with a clear concious compare this favorably to their previous 2 albums. Both Strictly Diesel and HoC are better in my opinion and this album should only be purchased if you have the other 2 and still can't get enough of this band."
4,..,"This is a really good cd, full of explosive guitars, and the signature Electronics that Spine Shank is known soo well for. If you are a Spine Shank fan or a fan of fast, head- bangin metal, with some melodic rythms this is deefinatly the cd for you! My favourite tracks are: #1. Violent Mood Swings -(Heavy)-#2. Slavery -(Heavy)-#4. Consumed (Obsessive/ Compulsive) -(Hard, electronics laced with screams)#6. Forgotten -(slow, cathy chorus)-#7. Self Destructive Pattern -(Heavy Chorus, Melodic Verses)-#9. Stillborn -(Outstanding Song)-#12.Dead To Me THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD!!!!!!"
3,"Ultimately fails to support his conclusions about postmodernism (good summary of developments in thought, though)","Hicks does a passable job, mostly, of disguising his politics in this book, and keeping to a very clear and concise history of philosophy from the englightenment. The overall impact is mired by his attempt to attribute the whole postmodernist movement to the resentment allegedly felt by a handful of intellectuals (which he thinks must have been extreme leftwingers) at the failure of regimes claiming to be socialist (even though it was agreed that they really were not). It's akin to watching a marathon runner complete 25 miles in record time and then stumble just before the finish line."
