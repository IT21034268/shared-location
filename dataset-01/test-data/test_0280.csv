2,A hodge podge of new age mysticism....,"Nothing new here. Grace is real and is wonderful, but Ms. Richardson doesn't seem to know where it comes from. Ms. Richardson begins the book with a personal story that doesn't mesh with timelines discussed, and so from the beginning, I got a sense that this had been hurriedly put together. The credibility of the author is questionable with such confusion. All philosophies are referenced in a way that comes off as being political correctness at it's worst. This book is a narrative on eastern philosophy for the most part. The Purpose Driven Life is the only Christian reference I noticed in her references, and in listing that, the author's name was misspelled. ""Rich"" Warren rather than Rick Warren. Hmmmmm."
2,"Mostly Sizzle, Little Substance","I'm glad I got this one from the library... it started out okay, but fell flat quickly. It's just the same rehash of the standard new age ideas -- only it's called Grace. A better book, in my opinion, along the same lines is Sonia Choquette's recent Trust Your Vibes."
5,Truly Touched by Grace,"It was truly a touch of grace for me to find myself watching Oprah (which I don't usually do)the day she had Cheryl Richardson, Martha Beck, and Louise Hay on her show. This book is wonderful, as is Martha's, and I have owned Louise Hay's book and given it to many friends over the past 25 or more years.""...Touch of Grace"" is a very personal, easy to follow book. Common sense is not usually a phrase one applies to a book that is probably categorized as ""spiritual"" or ""metaphysical"" but this book just makes a lot of sense, and if one is truly open to looking at how grace has touched their lives and willing to be aware, this book will be a great help along the way...to...peace and serenity, joy, etc., etc."
4,another one that was worth the wait....,"The best way I can describe the sound of The Avalanches is easy, imagine DJ Shadow working the decks for a Daft Punk live show at Robin Leach's mansion in the Bahamas. Now imagine that you have just the right amount of drink in you and you are swaying peacefully on the balcony overlooking the ocean as the sun sets on the horizon. Warm breeze and buzzy knees. This is the soundtrack for that feeling. This album is sequenced to be listened to all the way through in one sitting/dance session but if you're impatient or still unsure, listen to tracks #4 & #11. 'Two Hearts in 3/4 Time' and 'Tonight'. Spectacular, huh?"
3,Happy and Sad at the same time,"First, our son is only 4 but loves everything about this show - these characters are real to him. We assumed this would be a longer Christmas episode and while it was something new, the rest of the DVD was a number of the shows featuring Perry. I had really hoped for something new. We had also picked up a Christmas book and thought that may have been on this as well, but it wasn't. Our son also fixated on the opening credits for the Christmas special and was terribly upset that the actually story didn't contain a ""yeti"" - the book did. So one funny Christmas show and a lot of repeats of the regular old stuff. I would have thought Disney could have done this up a little better."
1,Nothing new,"I was very disappointed to find that these were all episodes already available on Netflix. I was hoping for something new for my kids, but this wasn't it. I regret this purchase."
2,Should have been fun but missed by a mile,"I just reread Murder at Maddingly Grange after about ten years. I was as disappointed this time as I was the last. It's got all the earmarks of a Wodehouse frolic crossed with a country house murder, a la, I suppose, Christie, but they just don't deliver. The attempt to emulate Wodehouse's delivery is overdone, and I can't quite figure out what the point is. Without giving away the ending, I can say that nothing is as you expect it to be, but not, unfortunately, in a good way. Pity."
3,"Interesting ""ghost"" story",I am giving this book a rating of 3 stars because of the dissapointing plot. The author couldn't seem to make up her mind as to whether or not she was writing a ghost story. There were many loose ends left at the conclusion of the book. The characters were not ones that I felt any really feeling for as they were not fully explored. The use of metaphors was a constant barrage rather than a well placed addition here and there.
2,true cliffhanger,"I was disappointed by this book for two reasons. First, the plot was told in a choppy stilted manner. Also, the book just seemed to stop on the last page rather than come to a plausible ending. However, the book seemed very well researched."
3,"Heavy on detail, light on thrills","I'll say this for ""Julian's House"", it certainly ranks as one of the more well researched haunted house stories I've come across. I think therein lies part of the problem; the author spends so much time bombarding us with the details of parapsychology and psychic research that the story itself seems to get lost in the shuffle. While the book is well written and full of evocative language, the thrill element of a good haunted house story is sorely lacking. What's the point of ghosts if not to give a scare or two? Try ""The Woman in Black"" by Susan Hill for a far better haunted house story."
3,Saint Etienne's magic gets lost in the shuffle,"Alot of these tracks really miss the point for true Saint Etienne fans. Take some miscellaneous techno-garbage, call it ""Like A Motorway"" and you have it. Many of the songs are comepletely unrecognizable as anything Saint Etienne and most are downright boring. However, Way out West's remix of ""Angel"" is absolutely inspired. You'll buy it so you can say you have it, but you'll only listen to about three songs on a regular basis."
5,"Yes, makes a great box cake!","I love to make quick box cakes, my 5 year old cannot eat most cake due to the eggs. He is allergic and his tounge gets itchy and burns. I used this in a Pillsbury box cake, and the cake came out fluffy, and perfect! Probably could have used about 5 more minutes cooking but that is my fault. Works great, highly reccommend!"
2,No Vehical Level,"I buy Bond Video games espacially for the car levels. Nightfire had none for the PC version, This ruined the fun for me."
1,"You can't use game controller, why bother?","Gone are the days of using your keyboard to control your moves and action in a pc game. Why the hell, in 2002, would EA release a game where you can't use a gamepad or controller? They did this with Nightfire. Although I did play some of the game and thought it was slick, good designs and all, it was maddening trying to do it using the keyboard. I beat this game on XBOX 5 years ago and have to say it was the hardest of all Bond games I've ever played. But it still was a lot easier than trying to play the PC version with a keyboard only. I've got better things to spend my time doing. THis is going in the garbage. Good thing it was free. Now, to the XBOX360 I go to play BloodStone. Thatgame is cool!"
1,Nightfire review,"As soon as I downloaded the game, the introduction began which was well done. However, after I started to play the game, the screen started to flash so much that I could not see what was going on. Unfortunately, this did not resolve. I would not recommend this game until the bugs are resolved."
3,average,"Way too much, here's what I'm gonna tell you and not enough telling you. Also way too much background and theory instead of actually doing anything."
2,Careful,"A pet peeve i have w/ Microsoft books is they just mirror the help files. This admin guide is not much more than regurgitated help files. I was hoping for some useful examples, closer to real life problems & solutions. Not there. Plz use the help files in Books Online to look up topics THEN examine the same topic in this book at a local bookstore BEFORE buying it."
5,Keep and re-read.....,"....for the pleasure of her excellent writing and editing, mis-en-scene and linguistic aptitude, P.D. James masters her literacy and advances ours. This book is the best P.D. James yet and I have read them all. Makes me wish for her immortality. I do not re-read books, but this one bears many re-reads and will give pleasure again and again. The remote setting, the vivid characters, the perfectly knitted plot. But most of all how her finely crafted writing compliments the reader and delights with its subtlety."
2,A real disappointment,"I'm a real PD James fan, so to be disappointed by one of her books was a real surprise. The plot just plods along and the resolution is so contrived as to be risible, with a feverish Dagliesh coming to his conclusions in ways he never has before. Read all the others, but not this one."
2,a little like Nebraska,"My husband and I listened to The Lighthouse on a drive through Iowa and Nebraska. We are both fans of P.D. James, and thought this would help pass the time on a long drive. Unfortunately, it only added to the tedium of the trip: poor plotting, lots of padding and repetition, and an anti-climactic denouement. I hope Ms. James returns soon to her normally-fine writing."
5,COOL!!!!,This set is really cool.The Aragorn is built nice and well and is a lot better then the older Aragorn from november.the only thing bad about this Aragorn is that he didn't get a set of bow and arows.But he never was that good with the bow.His cape is made from real fabric and not plastic!His legs can bend so he can get in riding possision on Brego.when your using him without brego you can stifin his legs up out of riding possision!Brego built pretty good to.You can ben his legs and stuf witch is cool.And I have to say that brego looks a lot like the one in the movie.Same with Aragorn.Overal this toy is perfect.
1,misleading picture,"I didn't buy this because I noticed the headline says 1/2 ounce, but I just wanted people to know who regularly use the product that the picture is of the bigger, 1 ounce version---just trying to help out anyone.p.s.--My cats love these flakes so I will continue to buy them, but you can get double the size of this offer for $7.99 at Petco."
1,DO NOT BUY - HORRIBLE!!,"I think that about says it all. I bought this book by sight, not reading the back - believing it was a new Nora Roberts book. NOPE. It was two books she wrote for Harlequin back in the early 80's. To read these is like pulling teeth. The books are very dated in their writing. And as for romance? There is none. In the first book, the character of Jake is made out to be the male romantic lead, but comes across as a male chauvinist pig. He's always forcing himself on Samantha. And Samantha just takes it. I love Nora Roberts, but not this. Save yourself the trouble and pass this book up!"
1,This is Nora Roberts??,"I bought this book because I like to read everything that Nora Roberts writes. I have read some of her early books, and have enjoyed them. However, if you've read any of Nora's books, you would hardly believe she wrote these. The other reviews are accurate. The heroines are not even likeable--they are silly and tempermental. How can anyone fall in love with them?? The heroes are inscrutable--so much so, that when they proclaim their love for the heroine on the last page, the heroine is shocked! No wonder, because they don't act like men in love, they act live cavemen ready to drag the woman off to the cave and ""ravish"" her. These stories are so old fashioned, they seem like they were written 30 or 40 years ago, not 20 years ago. I still can't believe that I am giving Nora Roberts (my favorite author) a ""1"" star review!"
1,"Overpriced, overrated, and greasy","This filter emits some sort of fine grease from the rotating mechanism which is very difficult to get off the glass and also does a good job of gunking up your lens cloth with black grease to be spread to other lenses and filters. The biggest waste of money I have thrown away on a piece of photographic equipment. I will never buy another B+W product again... unless they can show me that their product is somehow worth the exhorbitant price. In this case, it certainly was not. Whenever I see the B+W logo now, I just avoid it and walk away. Don't waste your hard earned money, get a japanese glass version at a fraction of the price and frustration."
5,Very insightful,"I have been studying Aikido for several years, but reading O Sensei's teachings and ideas has really made me look at the art much differently. The additional CD that comes with The Art of Peace is fantastic I play it every night while I am going to sleep and I wake up with a new thoughts on life and many other topics. I recommend this book and CD to anyone interested in the master's view and beliefs."
3,Good book,"This is a good book with small but deep thoughts from O'Sensei Ueshiba. I feel that all thoughts can be applied to daily life, and not only for Aikido practice. Perhaps a good philosophical complement for other technical books."
5,Rockin' Right,"Brian Setzer has always excelled when he kept things simple. If your toes aren't tapping and your hands drummin' on the steering wheel (or desk, table, whatever) then you must be dead. This is Setzer at his finest and every song is gem."
1,At least he's still trying.....,"I am completely stunned when I read those over the top, glowing reviews of this album. Have they heard ANY of Brian Setzer's classic Stray Cats rockabilly? These tracks are as tame and unlistenable as Choo Choo Hot Fish. Where's the fire Setzer brought to songs like ""18 Miles to Memphis"" and ""Rock This Town""? Setzer may still be one of the greatest guitar players in the world but his uninspired vocals on this album are just unbearable and borderline embarrasing. Believe me, I love Brian Setzer and I can't wait until he puts out another rockabilly masterpiece like ""Rant n' Rave with the Stray Cats"" or ""Gonna Ball"". Sadly this one just isn't it."
1,Not since David Bromberg came and went...,"have I been so repulsed by someone's singing voice, and it's so much worse when (as here) the person singing (Beck) thinks he's sounding really great and revels in it. He doesn't; and he's not a guy who should be relying on his vocals. Others call it a narcoleptic drone but that doesn't convey the sickening sense I got that Beck is immensely self-satisfied with the sound coming out of his mouth. I cannot begin to fathom the people (and evidently Rolling Stone magazine) who raved about this CD -- do they allow family members to write reviews for Amazon? Beck's agents? A few nice moments with the cellos, but other than that, please let me sell you my copy of Sea Change. In fact, send me postage and it's yours, FCFS. BTW I own and like Odelay."
3,ALL APOLOGIES,"Okay, now that I'm bored today and writing some reviews on here out of it, I have to say sorry for blasting this album the way I did. I couldn't stand Beck for the longest but six years later, I can get into Odelay and Sea Change isn't his most consistent but still a strong album which is erased of the classic David Bryne-esque take on Black music and cynicalism and is an attempt to make a timeless heartbreak album like some of his heroes, Neil Young and Gram Parsons. Beck sounds good sad. And who would have thought? The same goofball that made the brilliant ""Loser""? Beck still is overrated and music publications calling this all kinds of classics and best albums of the year are exragations(sp.)but Beck has skills.Now everyone, clap for me, for being a big man and apologizing. Sorry Beck."
2,"Marketing, not the music, creates the hype","Once again Beck adopts a different musical style - and again, he produces a listless group of songs that others have done far better. Why this guy continues to get the press he does is beyond me - the problem with critics is that they confuse experimentation with outstanding music. Beck's albums don't wear well - this one might sit in your CD player for perhaps a few weeks and then collect dust on your shelf. If you want to hear a singer songwriter with intelligent lyrics, strong melodies and outstanding vocals try Rhett Miller or Aimee Mann."
3,Overrated!,"I've listened to this album a bunch of times to try to understand what I'm missing, and I still don't get it. Sure, the sound is pretty, and the absence of Beck's soulless-sounding, smart-ass irony is a welcome change. But with the possible exception of the lovely ""Golden Age"", there's nary a memorable song in sight on this pleasant but forgettable release. The fact that Beck has invested this record with irony-free gravitas doesn't make it the ""masterpiece"" all the blowhard journalists are calling it (look, Rolling Stone also gave Jagger's pathetic last one 5 stars), nor do string arrangements or mopey singing. It's the songs, stupid! Check out Elliott Smith and Clem Snide for better examples thereof."
3,Different,"I dont know what people see in this album. It is very good, but is so much mellower than anything befor...even mutations. I didnt really like it because i am more into the weird freak out beck. Nothing wrong with this, other than if you like what beck is famous for, the strange and out there music, this is totaly different."
2,Not quite good enough,"I have long been a Beck fan, but as many times as I tried to get into this album, I just couldn't. There are about four or five songs that are good or great, but the rest of the CD just fails to get the blood flowing. As a whole, the lyrics may be worthwhile, but the lyrics can't carry the too slow, too uninteresting melodies."
1,BO-ring. Puts me to sleep every time,"I have never heard such a boring CD in my life. I loved ""Mutations"" -- especially ""Nobody's fault....but my own..."" -- this CD however is flat. A dud. I have listened to it over and over again wanting to love it. Sadly, I don't. The songs never get anywhere. They don't cast a spell. Hey, I like mellow music -- love Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, later Talk Talk, Bert Jansch, -- but this is just missing something. Ok, songs #1 and #10 are good and enjoyable...but the rest just never get off the ground, feel mundane, and tired. Sorry. I love Beck's other stuff and I admire him for making this album which is clearly heart-felt. I just don't like it...except for zoning out in a bad way."
2,"Wow, like, totally, so over-hyped","I don't know what everyone is raving about, honestly. Sure, it sounds all soft and mellow like a good Air record, with some Nick Drake mixed in there somewhere. . .but why not just listen to those artists' records? The lyrics are trite, the songs are boring, and the reason the music is sad is because every tempo is almost catatonic. I've always liked Beck, but without all the flashy bells and whistles of his previous releases, he reveals himself for what he is: a mediocre songwriter with a strong baritone voice and funny way of pronouncoing words.The production sounds superb, however. Of course, with Nigel Goderich at the helm, it's going to sound fantastic. But the core of this record is a bunch of sort-of-but-not-really sad, adolescent-angsty songs that will, with any mercy, put you right to sleep."
2,Dull...overrated...a big disappointment,"I started listening to Beck for his humor and genre-mixing. While the idea of Beck getting serious intrigued me, the actual album didn't. Every song on the album feels the same. While others might be excited by the presence of someone who has produced for Radiohead and one of Beck's earlier albums, Mutations, the airy production only further detracts from the album. Syd Barrett, one of the big influences you'll hear here, had a sound of immediacy--on his solo recordings, it's as if he's right next to you, singing and strumming his guitar. Here, the production covers up Beck and obscures the lyrics.If you like acoustic psychedelic Syd Barrett-esque music, try Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot--it's what this album should have been like. If you still want a low-key Beck, try Mutations instead."
2,The Most Over-Hyped Album Ever?,"When I read the 5 star review that Rolling Stone gave this and the 9 out of 10 score Spin gave it I ran out to buy it. While I expected a masterpiece that fused Nick Drake with some more modern sensibilities what I found instead was a boring, derivative album with a few electronic flourishes that failed in all ways to deliver. I'm not saying its a bad album as it isn't. But the melodies are bland and boring with very few exceptions. File this with Wilco's Yankee Foxtrot Hotel (or whatever its called) and Sleatter Kinney's One Beat as one of the most disappointing, over-hyped and under-delivering albums of the last several years."
5,................ABSOLUTELY TRANSCENDING.........>>>,"You can ignore the core fan base reviews of Beck because here he steps out of selfish pride and transcends the listener with beautiful melodies.I bought this based off Lost Cause and was instantly hooked on Beck..Little did I know what lurked beyond that...Sea Change is his most cohesive consistent record full of deep acoustics,bright strings and terminally addictive thought provoking lyrics.Beck's excellent unique voice sneaks up from behind and sticks in the mind.The album gives off the feeling of bleeding pain, acid rain and redemption..Easily my favorite Beck!!Sea Change is where real music from Beck begins."
5,Beautiful,"Easily assembled, beautiful wood. My12 year old very happy with it. Bench has very nice fabric seat. Would recommend as a gift for a young girl"
3,The Last Song - While at the airport,I am trying to find the last song when they were saying goodbye at the airport. Does anyone know name and title??
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I have a relativly new computer (about 1 1/2 years old) and I was so excited about this game! When I got it, I had a horrible time trying to install it. So I finally called costumer service and come to find out you need a specific memory card that is only standard in new computers. I don't remember reading anything about that. I'm very disapointed!"
2,"Great game, if you can get past the bugs...","First off, I have to say the game it's self is great. All of the new features are great, the graphics are supurb, and the realism is unbelievable!However, one possibly fatal drawback to this game is that it's already notorious for bugs. This is easily one of the least stable games I've ever played. And check out any Sim City 4 forum, I'm definitely not alone.Even with a fast system (mine is a 2.4Ghz P4, 1024MB DDR ram, 128mb ATI video card), and even after doing all of the defrags and disk clean ups that the game recomends, the game crashes, hangs, and displays glitches constantly. Turning down shadows, cars, etc can help, but what's the fun in that??While the game and it's graphics and features are great, this is definitely another prime example of EA releasing a game before it's ready, and your game play will suffer because of it. Maybe they'll release a patch some day..."
1,Read this review before purchasing this game!,If you buy this game please be warned that it is very bad.If you think this game will offer you the action packed thrills of GTA or anything along that line please reconsider. I play a lot of games and I know video games.
1,Big disappointment,"I have owned every version of Simcity. By and large, they have all been very well done and obviously well-tested. This version is neither. So far, one patch has been released and another is imminent because of severe problems with performance and gameplay. It is apparent from gameplay that playtesting prior to release was insufficient. The time it takes to master this game, assuming that is even possible, is far too lengthy to make Simcity 4 enjoyable.Given how many people are likely to be turned off by this release, we may be seeing the end of what was once the best sim series in gaming."
4,"Good game, but gets old.","Like most Sim games, this game is really fun and fascinating at first (the amount of detail itself is just amazing) but gets repetitive over time. Takes some patience."
4,A little disappointed,"Sim City 4A Great, and the only, city simulation game for the computer. This latest installment boasts the best graphics and special effects in the series, as well as more detail in the area of micromanagement.The Good:Graphics, sound, music, dynamic visualizations, disastersThe Bad:Awful terrain editing machine, railroads do not operate properly, streets and railroad tracks cannot bridge over each other or cross at odd angles on the city grid (although this problem should be corrected in Rush Hour), seaports and rail connections are a pain to get working properly, city areas are much smaller than in previous versions.Overall a great game, but not much better than Sim City 3."
4,Almost Perfect...,"This is a real good game. But if you put it up with SC3KU (Sim City 3000 Unlimeted), SC3KU just might win. The really bad things about this is it is WAY to hard (Example: H2 Power Plants $100,000) and the cheats are VERY lame. The best one gives you $1000. The new region design is perfect. Other then the 2 problams I mentioned. It's GREAT!!!"
2,To much...,"The graphics are stunning and the detail and more options are really nice. One problem, you may spend hours even days building the perfect city, and still it will decay and they'll kick you out (when u reach -100,000 dollars) not to mention that you'll have great health, low crime, low fire rates, high education, low pollution, and many other things that sims like, you'll still lose. Please if your a simcity fan wait tell the next simcity game. please?"
1,What a disapointment,"I don't very often wait on pins and needles for a new computer game, but I couldn't wait for Sim City 4. The hype was all about incredible graphics and a great new engine.Well, it was a bunch of hype. It's buggy as hell, slow, and the graphics are sometimes worse than Sim City 3000 (pipes for instance). I have a kick... system, so I don't think it's a confict with my hardware either. What happened Maxis? I loved SimCity 3000.I am hoping they come out with a patch soon...cuz this [isn't good]."
2,Why does it have to be so long?,"There is an excellent 100-minute film in Eureka, but this monster is an exercise in tedium that will appeal only to a particular niche of film buffs. Other reviewers point out that this is mainly a visual experience, with movie tributes to the likes of Hou Hsiao-Hsien for the anoraks to delight in spotting. But nobody seems able to tell me WHY it is so long. There is one scene where the bus pulls out of a diner's car park, and drives up the road that extends into the distance, over the hill and out of sight. Fixed camera wide shot, no cuts. It takes 2 minutes 40 seconds - why? We know where the bus is going, and the frame is not particularly interesting to look at. Maybe there is a deeper meaning to such anti-editing statements that I am missing, but it looks like Aoyama just couldn't be bothered cutting the thing properly. Two stars for the cinematography."
3,Just good,"Big enough, does not look very resintant but it practical and the wheels are very useful but roll weakly"
1,This TV is a piece of JUNK,"I had this TV for about 14 months. It started turning itself off for no reason since the day i baught it. About a week ago, we turned it off and it does not come on anymore. We have sound but NO picture. No flickering, no lines, no black shadows, nothing.Called Philips, they did not want to talk to me, because it is over a year and no extended warranty.I went to Sam's Club, Willowbrook Store in Houston, Texas, ( where i purchased the TV from), and the lady at Customer Services told me the same. No extended warranty and over a year, i need to call Philips.I paid around $1500 for it and now it is a piece of junk, unless you are blind and you want to hear the TV instead of watching it.STAY away from this TV, and i want to make sure that I will NEVER EVER buy Philips Products again. I am going back to Sam's Club Store and I am going to talk to the Manager, and see if he's going to be a little more helpful and give me a better answer. PHILIPS TV are JUNK."
3,Faith,"I am a Christian. But I am not from a Christian family. As the matter of fast, I am from a no religious family. I have faced with lots of pressure from my family since I became a Christian.I found this book one day from your web site. I have more faith and confidence to become a Christian. I recommend to my friend."
4,like this AC unit,"I have been using this unit for 2 years. I have been happy with it.my main cooling is an evaportive unit since I live in thehigh desert. the Amcor helps out when it is above 95 or humid. I havea pellet stove, and hook the exhaust hose to the stove pipe. this worksgreat if you wrap the exhaust hose and pipe with insulated bubble wrapthat is covered with foil. this keeps the hose and pipe cool. I havenever had to empty the water container. have it blowing right to mycouch. feels great when it is to hot outside, and I am watching HD TVhigh desert Mike"
1,the unit that suxxxxx,this unit really suxxxx. do not buy. stay away from this peace of junk.dont throw your money down the drain.it does not cool not even half of my room and my room is not big(10x10).
1,poor optics alignment,the unit i received showed double images which make the binocular useless... no eye adjustment/focus could bring the two images together. build material was acceptable.
2,tasco essentials 8x21 binocular,For the price ok i guess. unable to focus at long distance (football Field)of verry little use to me. I would not recommend this product
3,cheap but it works,works gud i can only see so far.. guess its wat a few bucks will buy u anyway. i like it
5,Very affordable and good quality.,These are really a great price for what you're getting. The image is clear and they feel like they will last for a long time if properly cared for. The focus is intuitive and allows for separate eye focusing. They are super compact (even more so than the picture leads you to believe) and come in a nice little case with a lens cleaning cloth. Perfect for travel or a spare set of binoculars.
1,Not user-friendly for people who wear glasses,"According to most of the other reviews, these are a great little pair of binoculars for the money. However, I found it very difficult to get them in focus because I wear glasses. Maybe I just don't kow how to adjust them properly, but I found them rather inadequate. Better instructions for novice users would have been a lot more helpful. I bought them for use at the opera, but I'm just not sure they will be very helpful."
5,Yes,I have as many seasons as there are I really like how it portraits the people who really made a difference.
5,"Excellent history, holds interest","I first saw this on the history channel, and when it became available on Amazon, I had to get it. Most historical movies get boring, but this is very well done; narration is unobtrusive and interesting, and the portrayal of these men and their contribution to America, even with their flaws, is excellent. I wouldn't call it gripping - you can stop it and come back to it later, but it's interesting enough to hold my attention throughout. This is a real compliment because a lot of the semi-documentaries put me to sleep."
5,Very Good,"I was convinced by my friends that this was the be-all and end-all of American History documentaries. It's not, but it is very good and certainly worth the money.It does also seem to have the ability to appeal to people who don't normally watch this kind of program."
2,The Town is Hopelessly Damned,"Another overwrought French film which suggests to the viewer that life stinks, especially for the working class, for whom, apparently, there is no joy or beauty. So you might as well kill yourself or kill the perceived source of your anguish. I really learned nothing about the complicated social fabric that is Marseilles or how the troubles that afflict these French might be addressed. I think this movie appeals to people who enjoy being manipulatd and are happy to leave the theater saying ""Mon Dieu! That was wrenching!"""
1,Don't Buy The Alaskan Hauler,"what an absolute waste of money! the folks at revell were evidently too cheap to cast a new molding for their truck model. instead, they include the regular three axle chassis and two extra pieces of frame. they expect the model builder to cut the chassis and reassemble with the extra piece inserted. it never worked right and the model is an absolute piece of junk. don't waste your money. revell should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Brilliant,"Barry is a genius, he has the most interesting writing style of anyone I have read and of course it's hilarious. Keep your dictionary handy because Barry has a tremendous vocabulary."
5,"But it's for the experienced, over-fifty crowd","Instead of the usual here's-what-you-do-because-I-say-so book, here's an account of what happened to David Abel -- a pissed-off job-seeker with three strikes against him: Too old (early fifties) too qualified and too well paid.At first, he does what everybody does -- sends out a lot of resumes. When nothing happens, he get's even angrier than when he was fired. The turning point comes when he decides he has nothing to lose, and turns that anger into some rather unorthodox ways of getting work.Don't let the listing at Amazon fool you. It should read, By David Abel as told to Irv Zuckerman, instead of the jumble of names it now presents. But theire's no mistaking the title of the book itself."
1,New Era cap,"The cap was of good quality, however the size indicated did not fit. I had recently purchase two other New Era caps from other vendors and both fit well. This one was ordered as the same size but obviously missed labeled.I also paid $20 extra for overnight shipping, however it took a week to receive the product. Of course this was not refunded when I returned the the cap. I will not be buying from Dick's Sporting goods again."
1,Not even close to McEwan's other work,"The first McEwan book I read was Atonement, and I was blown away by it. It is one of the best fiction books I have ever read.So I was shocked by how bad The Comfort of Strangers is. It's as if it was a bad adolescent novel McEwan wrote before he found his great voice. The novel has a bit of weird sex and violence, but nothing else of interest at all. Avoid it."
2,WHY?,"I was disappointed by this book. I think a short novel like this has to sparkle and it didn't at all. Most of the book concerns a couple on holiday walking about the shops and restaurants etc. In the latter part they get to know this couple who seem overly keen to be friendly and then there is the ending, which I won't spoil for you, that just left me thinking why on earth write such an empty, zero of a book."
3,Low Quality but fair price,"The size of the bag is appropriate for the speaker stands but it has an interior lining that will not withstand frigid weather. The lining is made of a very cheap vinyl and will crack if exposed to Winter weather. It was only $30.00 so what should I expect, right?"
4,Stalker by Andrey Tarkovsky,"This is a one of a kind film. There is no special effects except artist's own canvas. The whole movie holds viewer in irrational state of suspense, and he doesn't even know why..."
5,AWESOME!,"Great product. Shipped as promised and packed well. The price was great, too. I would buy from this seller again."
2,Terrible,Waste of money. You're better off squinting with your eyes. These binoculars barely magnifies. Do not buy. Go for higher zoom.
3,Mini Candy Canes for Valentine Cards,It was very fortunate that there were 280 because 118 of these candy canes arrived broken. They came in a plastic bag wrapped once with bubble wrap and not in the container shown. I called the vendor and they were very helpful. They promptly refunded half the price I paid for the candy canes. I would order from them again but I won't wait until the end of January to order them if I do this project again.
2,Broke after a few months,"I owned this hairdryer for about 6 months. I must have gotten a dud because it never seemed really powerful, got waaaay too hot, and broke after 6 months. My hair didn't look any different with this dryer than with my old Conair cheapie that I got from CVS."
5,Fantastic!,"I really love this blowdryer. It really does eliminate frizz. I'm not sure if my hair really is healthier, but it definitely LOOKS like it is!"
3,"Too HOT, Literally","This blow dryer has only two settings, high and low with a cold shot, The high setting is very,very hot, I'm assuming that is why it dries hair so quickly, don't hold it in the same place for too long, you could burn your scalp. I do like the light weight of this dryer and long cord. I would like to have a dryer that you can have more control over the heat and output of air. I most likely will not spend 100.00 to replace this dryer with the same model."
4,So far so good!!,"My wife seems to like the dryer and her looks great. She says its faster her only comment is that there is no ""high warm"" only a ""high hot"".Its a great product for a good price hopefully it will last the test of time. According to the other reviews, you can't return it to the manufacturer when purchased on Amazon.So far so good!!"
1,A BIG WATSE OF MONEY,Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.
1,WARNING!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,"I oredered this item and I received it in non-working condition.So, I figured i have to call their customer servive and ask for RMA...Yeah, right... just try to find their contact info online.Well, ok... I did get packing slip/invoice so I figured i will get their info there, right?Wrong! There is no info there either....I wonder if this company is even legal and paying taxes?!The only way you can contact them is thru amazon's email form and they will replay you with some generic email saying that you need to pay 15% restocking fee and return shipping fee!!So you recive an item that doesnt work and then you have to pay extra $50 or so to have it replaced!?It's just not worth my time....Dont take the risk of losing your time and money as I did.I had to file a claim to Amazon and i am looking forward to file a claim with BBB.Thanks for the reading and I wish you good luck!Sasa"
2,Serial Number Missing,"I ordered a T3 dryer from Amazon and it came minus the serial # so I was not able to register it with T3. At the high price, it needs to be registered for warranty. Amazon replaced it, and again, the serial # is missing!!! They are not buying these from an authorized dealer. The serial # should be on the cord. Anyone else have this issue?"
4,"its a timex, that much is true","I (like many people) have owned a number of timexes over the years and this is a solid member of that long line. For my eyes, the display is greatIts plenty durable, and I like the strap, its more comfortable than the plastic straps on my previous timexes and its lasted longer without cracking or breaking.You're not going to impress anybody with this digital watch on your wrist, but it keeps time very well for a 'cheap' watch (only timezone changes and daylight savings are any reason to reset the time- and it does 24 hour time). A great walking around outdoors watch."
1,Total nightmare of a blender,"I am surprised at how well everyone is doing with this model. Maybe I got a dud, I don't know, but my Wave Station is garbage. The plastic container has two pieces, which I could not dislodge from each other. Therefore, I could never entirely clean the thing. Worse, the other parts are similarly difficult to remove when following the assembly instructions. I never got it to work right; it would not crush frozen strawberries for a smoothie.I am going to have to call customer service before ever getting it to work. VERY disappointed."
3,One touch dispenser - yeah right!,"This is a good smoothie blender, but there are a few things I don't like about it. For one thing, you can't really clean it in the dishwasher unless you want to risk warping all the plastic parts. (There goes one star.) Also, the one touch dispenser doesn't really work with a pint glass. It's too tall to fit under there straight. This can be overcome by holding the glass at a tilt and pushing the dispense button with your finger, but ultimately I opted to remove the spigot and use the included cap instead. (Another star.)If you've got your heart set on dishwashing, don't get this. Otherwise, for the money it's decent."
4,Really chops the ice!,"I admit it...even after reading the previous reviews I thought THERE IS NO WAY THIS THING IS GOING TO GET FROM WHOLE ICE CUBES TO SMOOTHIE. I mean come on - every blender says it does ice but they never do. Alas, this time I was dead wrong. The smooth smoothiest smoothies I have ever made! The key to dispensing is to have it running at the time. It is a little awkward with the cup. I usually end up pushing on the lever with my fingers while holding the cup, but that might be my own paranoia. As for the dishwasher - I have a two year old and a three year old - everything goes in the dishwasher and so far so good! Only one mishap we've had - my hubby was able to pull off the top of the container without the bottom staying attached which resulted in sticky ooey gooey smoothie EVERYWHERE. That being said, he might not have attached it right in the first place. All I'm sayin' is - watch out for that. It is a week later and I'm still finding sticky spots."
3,"Works well, but . . .","The ""wave"" action turns out nice smoothies and shakes, but if we had known the pitcher, lid and blade attachment were not dishwasher safe we'd have chosen another blender. Having to hand wash each piece (and, look out, the blades are very sharp) seriously limits our interest in the time needed for breakfast fruit drinks - the main reason we bought it."
4,A Great Smoothie Maker!,"It really gets rid of ice-chunks, but you have to make sure you put the liquid in before the ice. If the liquid is too thick or thin the dispenser doesn't work well, and it's hard to clean out. But everything else is easy to use and easy to clean. A good quality buy."
3,Nice,"It does a good job on most things. be sure to add ice/frozen fruit slowly, one at a time, or else it tends to get clogged."
5,Una excelente historia,"Me lleve este libro a mis vacaciones y no pude dejar de leerlo. Los personajes te atrapan lo mismo que las historias de Libertad Gonzalez, tanto en la carcel de Mexicali o mientras maneja trailers por los Estados Unidos. En esta novela la habilidad de Escandon como narradora de historias alcanza un nuevo nivel. Leelo y no te pierdas el sorprendente final."
4,Perfect Base for Poker in general,"Perfect Base for Poker in general, but I am only a Texas Hold'm No Limit player. Many examples of his theories were based on 7 card stud, Razz, Highball Lowball. Poker variants where I'm not familiair with. Even the Hold'm examples were based on limits instead of ""No Limit"".However the theory will keep standing for all poker variants and it was definately worth studying it."
5,A serious book for serious players,"Any person who needs to know ""when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em"" must pick up this book. Mr. Sklansky teaches you what the good players know. Ever wonder if you were wrong in folding that four flush? With the help of Mr. Sklansky you will understand."
3,Out of date - there is a new game in town,I hate to give such a great book a negative title and mediocre review but the fact is that this book is just no longer relevant. Had you bought this before the poker boom you would be golden. The best piece of advice you can get from this book is the basic theory. Other than that the whole book is geared around limit cash games. We all know that NL tournaments is where it is at right now so I would check out Dan Harrington's books first.
2,Nothing Christmas about TRL,"What is the point of getting a bunch of pop stars together to make a Christmas CD that sounds nothing like a Christmas CD. There are maybe 3 tracks that will get you in the Holiday spirit.Among them is Nsyncs I Don't Wanna Spend One More Christmas Without You, Christina Aguileras Angels We Have Heard on High, and Trans Siberin Orchestras Christams Cannon. Willa Ford is the worst thing about this album making a funky, sexy, inappropriatesong called Gimme Gimme Gimme. These songs seem out of place and don't fit on a Holiday CD. I would much rather hear these artists take holiday classics and redo them almost like the original versions. Instead they make a mess out of them."
5,THE BEST!,"Fantastic Christmas album. My favorites include TLC' Sleigh Ride, Little Saint Nick by Sugar Ray, My Christmas List by Simple Plan."
5,Bob's New Christmas CD,This singalong collection of holiday favorites is great for bringing the whole family together in song. What makes them highly accessible is the fact that they are arranged in keys that are comfortable to everyone.
5,A great collection of the best musician ever.,"This CD just goes to prove that Breed is the most talented rapper of all time. Each song, old and new, has the beats and lyrical finesses that Breed has always displayed. There isn't anyone who can compete with him."
5,My Favorite,"I am comparing this shaving cream to Pre de Provence, Proraso, and Art of Shaving. It is my favorite. It lather's beautifully will just an almost sized dollop, and smells great. As far as performance, it more than sufficiently lubricates my face for my DE razor."
5,None better! NONE!,"First of all one tub of this shave cream will last me 6 months. Just a tiny dab is all you need. This shave cream smells manly and fresh, creates lots of thick rich lather that helps that blade glide over the face. I use a metal shaving bowl and transfer the cream from the tub to the bowl. I let it sit up and harden. Let the brush get hot with water and run some hot water into the shave bowl,mix it around and walla you have a hot shave cream. You will be astonished at how long it lasts. Don't let the price scare you away. This is the most economical cream shave around!"
2,RATHER POOR,"NOT PLEASED.First Off I Must Say I Really Liked The Strong Scent In The Soap And The Fine Way It Lathered.But Shaving itself was a 'Wretched and Miserable' experience with this stuff.First of it left my face very dry and sore and secondly even after 3 passes with a Merker Adjustable Razor with a new blade I still had way too many hairs on my face.Now granted my beard is pretty tough so it takes a 'Good Product' to shave me smooth so I evaluate my shave soaps by.1. Scent and Softness.2. 'HOW MUCH HAIR IS REMOVED PERIOD"".Anyways i wound up having to re-lather with Proraso a product that works to get a smooth shave.....But to finish the shipper sent me the product quickly and the soap does have a pleasant scent.Otherwise I'm not pleased so I guess this is my first negative review but maybe the soap was old, Its hard to say?.Nuff SaidIndiana ED"
3,Good but I may not buy again,"I bought this shaving cream based on its great reviews. But I am not as impressed as the other reviewers. I have to use a lot of it to get sufficient lather. Secondly, I do two coats when I shave. The lather never lasts more than one coat, so I have to use even more of it."
3,"Overpowering scent, mild irritation","Pros: The lather on this stuff is incredible. As full-bodied and creamy as anything I've ever encountered, requires very little on the brush and whips into a robust lather extremely quickly. Allows for a very close shave.Cons: The smell is overwhelming and the cream causes irritation/razor burn. Of course, each person's mileage may vary according to the sensitivity of his skin, but I can only review a product based on my own experience of it. I was very disappointed to feel a dry, burning sensation during the shave and some noticeable razor burn afterwards. From what I understand, this appears to be a problem more with the Sandalwood-scented Taylor than with TOBS in general.If you have hardy skin and very tolerant olfactory nerves, give this cream a try. Otherwise, there are gentler scents and formulations out there."
1,beware,"the product wasn't in its original package, the cream was spilled obviously an opened product and not the same shaving cream as it used to be..."
4,Provides a good shave without breaking the bank,The scent is nice and it provides a nice surface for shaving on without cuts and irritation. I like that I can reuse the tub to if I want to try soaps that come in a puck form. I wasn't expecting it to contain alcohol (which it does) so be prepared for a tingling sensation that you don't get with shaving soaps. I loaded up my brush once and was able to lather up for two passes with some left in the bristles so it should last a while. I would recommend that you get a moisturizer to put on before and after you use this product.
4,Great smell that lasts,Very pleased with my latest selection from Taylor of Old Bond. The fragrance lasts and lasts. It's clean and shaves well.
1,One word: arrogant,"I just don't get this book. Who is Walzer to tell us what is right and wrong? I think this author goes too far in voicing his opinion, often placing his views as being right. He even goes as far was backing his ""opinions"" with real events! I think authors like Walzer are a real danger in our society."
4,excellent supplemental material,"As a high school AP teacher, I use excerpts from this book inmy European History class. ... My HIGH SCHOOL students both understandand love Walzer's analysis which they find very topical. His discussion on humanitarian intervention and on the ethical dilemma involved in the bombing of Dresden are of particular note. This is not your typical war book but asks that you think and consider war's ethical dimensions."
3,Kinda Disappointing,"I can't put my finger on it, but I was left with a dissatisfied feeling after reading this book. They do a fine job of telling what happened from Ken Starr's perspective, but too often I was overwhelmed by the minutae of what they were discussing. While far less polemical than the other takes on L'Affaire Lewinski, I just didn't get excited reading this book."
5,"The Truth is, Clinton Broke the Law",This is a backroom report as to how the investigation of Clinton progressed. I thought this book showed me how the White House spin doctors really tried to help Clinton regardless of of his law breaking.
2,door closer,"Nice product, easy to install. Strength not quite enough to bring door to fully latched position but very nearly closed."
5,Epic,Historically tennis movies have been terrible. The Break is fantastic. If your a serious tennis player then this has to be your all-time favoirte movie.
1,OpticSale cancelled order due to price mistake,"With great dismay, OpticSale the seller of this product cancelled the order and reasons were also not sure..they said it was IT pice mistake and in the explanation mail, they said the product is out of stock. It seems Amazon is either taking the customer for ride or OpticSale is taking Amazon for a ride, either way I am at the loss, because I could not gift it to my father.Please make sure before you deal with OpticSale that they have items as available beore you order and avoid such a frustrating situation."
5,Good patch cable,"What can I say? It is a cat-6 patch cable. The price is decent, but don't buy it unless you have use for a gigabit connection. Actually. You only really need a gigabit network if you move around big files and have a network adapter and the hardware that supports it."
3,Banabila - VoizNoiz II: Urban Sound Scapes,"Banabila's second album, Voiz Noiz 2, follows in the footsteps of his first, mixing tiny vocal samples with trip-hop beats. This time, however, he focuses a little more on the trip-hop aspect and less on the structuring of the samples. ""U-Beat,"" for instance, is very beat-oriented. Actual song structure is more of an issue here: ""One for the Road"" is completely abstracted, while ""Speak"" is a more traditional 4-to-the-floor techno number. Overall, though, the album isn't as interesting as Voiz Noiz was. The tracks are good -- like the spy funk of ""Dinoh Dinoh"" -- but I was just hoping for more."
3,"Average quality, low price","I had ignored the review comments mentioning that this is not the right one if you are specific about the audio quality. I thought it would be okay. But the quality was not good enough for me. I almost keep the volume maximum in my mp3 player to be heard in my hall.The speakers look cute on my kitchen counter. I carry it from room to room without worrying about plug points. I just play it in the background though out. Will not be loud enough for outdoor, but good for the price.The delivery was done fast with good packing from amazon."
1,This book is decieving like Gary Zukov.,"He tells that the astral world is made up of your thoughts and fantasies and the higher realms are made up of humans elavated thoughts about heaven.Thus,implicated the thought in your head that your astral travels are ILLUSORY.In fact they are of seperate creation and is an insult to fearies/nature spirits/angels/God by saying they are not real.This book is bad.This goldberg man reduces the spiritual art to nothing but a form of childrens dream.This book won't help you to leave your body either,it has methods that he expects you to simply master.Also he does not tell how to find you guides or friends but tells you instead when you do find them.I would have refund this book if I didn't leave in my salon floor for a month."
5,Excellent explanation of the architecture,"Dr. Goldberg does an excellent job of putting all of the various components of the multidimensional universe together in one book.His accounts and descriptions of how the Astral world is laid out so to speak is very consistent with many other well noted authors on the subject. When reading this book I felt like I was getting his perspective of the universe and not a copy of someone else's work. When dealing with this subject matter I think it is important that the author relate his experience in the matter and not that of the general consensus. Dr. Goldberg does this.As Dr. Goldberg would say, ""There are no absolute truths"". However when you can verify an experiences out of the body thousands of times over, there is a pretty good chance it is accurate.If there was no structure to the universe what would be the point of life?"
1,never received it,Ordered this book a few weeks ago. Never received it. Had to go purchase a new copy at much greater expense.
5,Best pie ever!,"The first pie we baked in this pie pan was the first pie we baked on our wood stove, and it cooked great! I was very nervous how it would work the first time, getting the feel for the new pan, but the crust and the custard both cooked perfectly (in our gas oven, it was always a bit of a dance to keep the crust from burning until the custard finished cooking). Well made, good seasoning, we love the size and the look of it."
3,Bushnell Pwerview 16*32,"Well, the binoculars are OK. Not bad - but not good. They are definitely 16X, which I love but as much as I adjust the lenses - the image is never ""easy to see"". Not sure if that makes sense. It is kind of clear, its just very difficult to see. I think it might be the light that comes through the lenses make it hard for the eyes. I've tried other brands (more expensive), and you can really notice the difference. I wouldn't get these for serious observing of game like deer or wild birds."
3,Bushnell 16x32 Binocular,"I had high hopes when I ordered this binocular. I read all the mixed review and thought I'd give it a chance. The price was very good compared to the stores in my area. I bought this binocular to use at the stadium to get a closer view of the game. I'll give it a 3 star rating: The focus adjustment is fustrating at times, I constantly need to refocus. At the best focus the center of my view is good while the outer edge is not as clean. The attached landyard is just a string that digs in to my neck. The only good thing I like about it is that it's compact and easy to carry in my waist belt. (pouch is included) If I had to buy this again I would look for something else."
2,Accurate but no power,"Pros: Very accurate right out of the box at 30 feetGood for plinking.Con: CO2 cannister hard to install. Turnkey is located inside bottom of grip, allowing tightening only with fingertips and allowing 1/2 turn each, at the most. Thus causing a considerate amount of air loss before the cannister is properly seated.Power of shots are inconsistent and degrades rapidly after the first few rounds.Wothless for varmits."
5,An excellent illustrated guide!,"I first tried just borowing that mit guide from a friend. It was interesting reading, but kinda left me confused. So, I decided get some actual books including this Visual Guide. It was so refreshing to find one that so clearly explained everything to me. I had a lot of success at home, though havn't been able to do the advanced locks yet. Beginners should just start here and save yourself a lot of trouble. When it comes to lock picking, this book was really complete and I thought the illustrations helped everything make sense."
3,A very BASIC Visual Guide to Lock Picking,"It's a very simple book and a short one too. Don't spect to learn a lot of thinks from this book. If you are only looking for an introduction in lock picking and how a lock works, then this book is fine for you. Maybe you can get a more complete book with no more money."
1,More harm than help,"Jay Adams has single handedly done more to do harm to mental health in the name of Christ than any other author in the last century. It is time that the concept of an individual's sin having a direct correspondence to their state of mental health be put to rest for good. A person with a massive coronary may need more prayer and to confess his or her sins but medical intervention is needed for a cure. In much the same way, a diagnosable mental disorder is in need of medical attention, and to counsel otherwise is irresponsible and the polar opposite of true Christ-like compassion. If one can justify the balanced use of the ""medical establishment"" for heart disease then the same justification can be made for treating mental illness. This publication, like most of his, should be avoided except as an insight into the ultra-conservative evangelical mind as it relates to mental illness."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I purchased a $1 DVD at the store a couple years ago where Joey Bond masterfully teaches the first three (four if you count ""sink to the earth"") postures. Each session is about 25 minutes and is a great workout, after doing each posture for a time I felt like I could really master each one and even begin to combine them. My wife got me this set for Christmas because of how much I loved the other - same great teacher, but I miss the extended workouts and the episodic fortune cookie at the end of each exercise. Still worth the money and the effort, be be aware that if you are hoping for the same instruction as on the $1 disc, you are going to be disappointed."
5,Nice Binoculars!,"I wasn't expecting too much, but these things are nicely made. I have used them in the field a few times and they worked great. Nice compact and camo binoculars. I plan to use these for years."
1,Suggestion,"I found this book to be lacking.For those who want to read a great book on heavy metal. I suggest ""Bang your Head - The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal"" by David Konow on Three Rivers Press, a division of Random House publishing."
3,A Light Read,"This is a pretty good book if you want some light reading and you're a fan of metal music, although lots of non-metal bands are covered. It's interesting to read the stories of all the bands in the book. Some bands, though, have no business even being in the book, and others are given too much emphasis, leaving out other deserving bands. There are also lots of annoying mistakes, like ""Melissa Auf de Meyer"" instead of ""Melissa Auf de Maur."" If you want some serious metal reading, this book isn't for you. But if you want a quick read with lots of glossy, colorful pictures, buy this book."
1,Horrible!,"This video was the worst thing i have ever saw. The acting was atrocious, the cinematography had so many mistakes. The story was retarded.These measly reviews are fake...the movie has been out for nearly a year and only 3 reviews? That should tell you something!"
5,love these!!,I love these pencils!! They are very pigmented and are smoother than regular watercolor pencils. Amazon's price is better than all my local art stores too.
2,I'da given it one star but I couldn't do that to Leon,"I feel bad enough giving it two stars... sorry but this is only for people who want to have the whole Leon Russell catalog. It says ""piano and orchestra"" but it is ""piano and synthesizer..."" It's a sound that doesn't vary much from song to song and frankly it gets very tedious to listen to. If he'd have only sung on some of these! (it's all synth-strumental). And yes, I agree with the other reviewer, that's a great picture of Leon on the cover and the white beard reminds you of Santa Claus. Okay then. If that is all you want from this record, then buy it."
4,7DAYS,ok this movie is an ok movie. it is one of those japanese to english remakes. if i can compare it to anything it would be the grudge. the only reason why you would want to watch this movie more than once is when there are a bunch of people over who have never watched it and you wanna have a good time. i bought it only because it was the first ever horror movie i watched and it would be fun to relive what experiences i had with it. basically its an ok movie but i think someone should rent this movie not buy it.
3,Did you know...,"I have this DVD and earlier this morning(9:50 A.M) I was watching the trailers and stuff and I pushed the down button when I was on the ""Watch This"" Icon and the red arrow was not on anything so I clicked okay on the remote and it let me watch the tape!"
2,Ok but not my cup of tea!,"This is the most weirdest movie that I can think of. The acting was great but the story line was stupid. What the hell ""You'll die if you see the ring"" oh ahh scary. This has no meaning to it. Oh wow they get a call telling them ""Seven Days"" ohh even scaryier. What is the big deal with these stupid movies? That is all, Good-bye."
1,I want my 2 hours back... =(,"The Ring is boring. Why so many people say it's scary is beyond me. The so-called ""investigation"" was pointless, and it still didn't explain anything about why the deaths were occuring. The plot was needlessly slow and the mildly ""scary"" parts were too few and far in between. It's rated PG-13, how scary and disturbing could it be? Creepy music and spooky scenery just doesn't do it for me. I'm very disappointed.As far as the ""extras"" on the dvd goes, they're pretty week, it's just a collection of edited scenes and non-sensical images."
5,A Horror Movie that doesn't resort to Gore,"I think what impressed me most about this movie is that it was the scariest that I had seen since ""The Exorcist"". And yet it was not at all gory or gross; it definitely doesn't play to the lowest common denominator. And let's face it: today's audiences have been so innudated what blood, gore, and gross-out movie effects, that such things just aren't scary anymore. Now, when I see a particularly graphic movie, I'm not thinking ""Oh my God!"", I'm thinking, ""How did they create that effect?"". Many times, I have heard movie audiences laugh or hoot when someone gets eviscerated. The gross-out factor actually works AGAINST creating a sense of horror. But in this movie, the shocking shots are so brief, they're almost subliminal. Somehow, that makes them VERY frightening; you're left thinking, ""What the hell was that?"" Believe me, this movie will stay with you long after the last frame."
4,THE RING,"THE RING is one of the greatest horror flicks ever made. The movie follows reporter Rachel Keller (played by Naomi Watts), as she tries to figure out why a mysterious videotape killed her niece, a week after watching it. Rachel shows the tape to her ex-husband (played by Martin Henderson), and they team up to try to find records, the meanings to mysterious happenings, and the reason to why the tape kills, with only seven days to live. After Rachel's son Aiden watches the tape, she travels to a strange island only to find even weirder things, and the secrets and mystery behind THE RING.The movie is great, although the dvd lost a star for lack of special features, etc.if you liked this movie, DO NOT see Ringu- its a dissapointer."
4,This movie stays with you long after you watch it.,"Some may say this is not a great film, but for me it has the #1 spot for the scariest movie i've ever seen. I'm not into gore fests, or some stupid ghost story where the plot is about staying in a haunted house all night for a million bucks. This is a pschological thriller, that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and makes you not want to be home alone at night for a week after seeing it. I recommend seeing this movie if you like scary stuff BUT DO NOT WATCH IT ALONE!!!!"
5,DOWNRIGHT CREEPY!,"I've often said, I like my scary movies to be acted by actors who take the plot seriously. In other words, no dopey humor. I thought this might be another one of those but I was pleasantly wrong! This has all the ingredients for a good scare: moodiness, rain, good old fashioned creepiness and more.Fans of ghost movies may recognize a bit of ""The Changling"" here. But ""The Ring"" is different enough from that to be its own movie. There's an upsetting part dealing with a horse too. I just consoled myself by realizing animals are not allowed to be hurt making film.Anyway, watch this in the dark!"
4,The Ring Review,"The ring is best described as a horror film. It is definitely a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. A thesis statement for this movie would be, a woman searching to find more and more clues as to how her neice died. Throughout the movie Rachel (the protagonist, played by Naomi Watts)finds more and more clues and pieces it together at the end of the movie. Rachel goes through anything and everything to piece together how her niece died. She even drives long hours and talks to people she has never met before. As well as looking on the internet for more information.I would recommend this movie to people who like horror and thrill. I thought it was an excellent movie with an excellent plot."
2,"""Before you die...."" of boredom!","Not scary, storyline is hokey. Bad visual effects. Stupid premise. What more can I say except skip this piece of garbage and rent ""Signs,"" a better and scarrier film! Grade: D-"
1,this movie [STUNK],"I don't see how in the world anyone could sit and watch this movie without laughing. It is such a cliche. It uses the phone ringing without anyone being there like on scream, and seeing ""the ring"" before you die and having a certain time limit before you die is from Fear dot Com. It has the little boy being a sort of prophet like the little girl in Bless the Child. It is awful. The woman who played Aydens mom didn't act like she was even scared most of the time. They could have picked better actors/actresses than the ones they did. Maybe it's just where I have seen so many of these movies that they are all running together. But i thought it was an awful movie."
2,A confusing mess of a movie!,"This is easily one of the dumbest ""mainstream"" movies released in recent years. The story line is inconsistent, incoherent and illogical. There are some creepy moments, but the minute you start to analyze the movie, it just falls apart. The only thing that keeps it from being a total dud is the production quality ... and the fact that Naomi Watts is quite a looker. As for those people who say it's ""the scariest movie ever"" I have to wonder what other movies they've seen. Probably not Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, or any of Wes Craven's flicks, to name a few!"
2,not as creepy as Ringu :-(,"High-budget remakes don't always turn out better than their predecessors. And this is a good example. The creepiness from Ringu just didn't transfer very well onto this remake. I'd rather not give away too much detail by explaining why. However, I think one of the reasons that makes The Ring nearly as good as Ringu is that more viewers understand english. Afterall, who likes reading subtitles?"
5,Excellent,"I'm a huge horror fan and have seen most horror movies out there. This is by far one of the scariest I have seen. If you enjoyed the Shining, or any thing to do with ghosts and murder etc. This is the best. Remember it is one thing to lose your life, but another thing to lose your sould to The Ring. ;-)"
3,"Creepy, but very unrealistic","This movie was scary, but really it's so unreal. Who's ever really heard of if you ""Watch this tape"" then in ten days or whatever you're going to die? That's so ridicholous. When I first saw this movie I had to watch the rest of it just to see what would happen at the end, and I was just thinking I was so glad I rented this. Overall I don't think it's the best suspense/horror film out there. There are some parts in there that will make you a little scared but really it's not the best movie. Rent it if you want to see it."
4,One of the better recent horror movies,"I love horror movies, especially supernatural ones. Unfortunately so many of the recent horror movies just go for a few cheap scares and have boring or non existant story lines. This one got me hooked from the beginning and kept my interest all the way through. The evil in this movie was well presented and actually made me feel uncomfortable when I sensed it was present. What actually prompted me to buy this movie (as I originally saw it in a movie theater) was how awful Ring Two (its sequel) was. It made me appreciate this one so much more."
1,wake up pills anyone ?,"I'm giving this movie 1 star since i don't seem to find the zero.zzzzzz...Oups! I'm sorry,almost fell asleep just talking about it.The bars on the top and bottom of the screen in the widescreen edition would be helpfull if they covered the entire screen.Even donuts look more frightening than THE RING."
1,Hollywood Stinks!!!!!,"P>Get the original Japanese movie Ringu instead, even with this...directors ...story this terrible remake doesn't have any of the true eerieness or suspense of the original low budget film!"
1,Why are movies getting so bad,"This movie has no plot at all. If possible I would give it a negative rating. At least the slasher type movies don't pretend or try to sell themselves as being intelligent thriller horror movies. This movie never scared me, what scares me is the number of people who actually found it frightening and weren't bothered by the lack of a plot or storyline.Don't waste your money renting or buying this movie, if you want a creepy movie with a plot stick with the classis like The Birds or Psycho."
2,Please stop.,"So many people are gushing over this movie. It is average at best.Just to review, a thriller spins a tale with clues and loose ends along the way. This movie has some good points; imagery and cinematography bumped this movie up to the two stars. However the storyline is thin, and in the end there is no aha moment. Most of the loose ends are not tied up, and explanations go unmentioned. It's easy to write a thriller with no resolution."
5,"Very interesting and very, very strange. I LOVE IT !!!","One of the bes horror movie. Watch this one. Very interesting story and a very, very descent horror film. Really, for me, a masterpiece. If you are gonna watch this one, then I am recomending you that you pay attention to every detail in the movie from the first second to the last. It doesn't have an ending yet, but THE RING 2 will premier this March. So I suggest you watch this one already. If you like descent horror films then go and rent or buy this one, but if you do not appreciate great descent horror films, then run off watching EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS. HAHAHA."
3,It's alright...,"...P>There's some disturbing visuals, a somewhat original premise based on the original Japanese film, some solid acting (especially from Watts and the boy) ... I am reviewing this film almost two years after it was released and I saw it last night on cable. Nothing really gave me a chill. Watching Exorcist again after all these years most certainly does. I think the problem is, the whole film is setting up that one scene towards the end. You know, when Samara crawls out of the TV, looking not unlike Linda Blair in that other movie. It is a well shot scene and if you don't ""see it coming"", it'll scare the beejesus out of you.But you've probably heard the hype by now. It might not make you jump out of your pants anymore. And what you're left with is a sub-standard thriller with a plot that doesn't make much sense."
2,"All filler, no thriller...","This movie could have been good, but it got caught up in explaining itself and then everything fell apart. The story was too tangled to make sense. Too many weird coincidences needed to happen and did happen, making the movie seem cheap and hollow. There were some creepy parts, especially when the little girl comes out of the TV. But come on folks, all the gay horse farm crap, and the orphan daughter crap, and the psychotic mother crap...it's too much. People call this a psychological thriller, but it's more of a confusing thriller. The Ring 2 is even worse. All filler, no thriller. Trust me."
4,Very cool stuff,"I've never seen ""Ringu"", but I get the feeling I'd like it, since I really like this. I agree with what seems to be the general sentiment in that you should watch this more than once to catch everything and truly appreciate it.Stellar performance from Naomi Watts. This was her first movie in which she played the main character, and she carries that weight very well. Martin Henderson was good, too, as the more laid-back of the two investigating the mystery of the tape.I say watch ""The Ring"" every Halloween. You're bound to be creeped out."
5,The Best Horror Movie Ever Maded!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie rocks, it's the best horror movie ever maded. It's on my top 5 best movies of all time. The Ring is scarier then Rosemary's Baby and The Exsorceis. You can watch the ring over and over and still be scared. Add The Ring to your movie collection. You can not let this movie pass you by. If you like horror movie you will like The Ring."
2,Nothing Explained,"What was most upsetting about this movie is the fact that nothing is explained. Nothing is resolved. And if you're content with watching a movie and not receiving all the information necessary to understand WHY things are happening, then you'll be ok watching this. Yes it is somewhat creepy. Yes, Naomi Watts is a fantastic beautiful actress and does a great job along with the boy who plays her son. Yes, the plotline was a fantastic one that could have been developed better.But in the end, you are left with a movie that doesn't explain why the ""entity"" is killing people, where this ""entity"" came from, nor how to defeat it. Unless they come up with a sequel/prequel movie that answers my concerns above, then this movie will have been a waste for me."
4,Good Scary Movie,"This was a better-than-average horror flic. Naomi Watts, (who could pass for Nicole Kidman's sister), is an outstanding actress and plays her role excellently. You have to pay close attention, or you could lose the plot in this one. There are a few scenes that are genuinely scary, but it's not the scariest movie out there. Definitely worth watching."
5,An Example of How to do a Good Remake,"The Ring is a remake of Japanese film Ringu which I also own on DVD. It is sound and creative film. When I saw the previews of this film, I knew it would be good and it was. But when I saw the previes for the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre I knew it would be very good and I was completely wrong, go figure. Highly Recommended"
3,COOLEST MOVIE ON EARTH!!!!!!!!!,"THE RING WAS SO COOL THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT I GOT SCARED BUT THE SECOND TIME I SAW IT IT WASINT THAT SCAREY.THE MUSIC OF THE MOVIE WAS GREAT AND THE BEST CAST AND CREW,I THINK I LOVE IT BECAUSE NAOMI WATTS WAS A FLOWER.IF YOU GUYS HAVE A SLEEPOVER ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT THE MOVIE YOU WANT TO PICK IS THE RING AND IN THE ENDING SAY BEFORE YOU DIE YOU SEE THE RING"
5,The Ring,"The Ring is a Horror movie (and one of the most scaring ones). It is suitable for teenagers and adults.The Ring is about a reporter, Rachel, (Naomi Watts) that found out that a video tape killed her niece ,Kathy. After she investigates the tape, she finds out that this tape has many strange things. When Rachel watches this tape, her phone rings and a strange voice tells her that she will die in seven days. Her ex-husband and her child watch the tape as well and then they try to look for the origins of the tape and to save their lives.I recommend to all of the Horror movie lovers to go and watch this movie, I garantee you won't sleep peacfully at night after watching it. But it's worth it...."
2,no explanation,the movie did have a few good scares in it but it wasn't as scary as it's hyped up to be because the don't explain ANYTHING! if you think about it you could figure out parts of it but you don't have enough info to solve the whole mystery. another reveiw said this was an A through H flick and I couldn't say it better myself.
3,"Good for an avg movie, Weak for a horror movie","My title says it all.I am a big fan of horror movies, but this one is below the standards and my expectations.It is not as bad as feardotcom but still, not as good as some monster-movies, slasher-like from this time (Jeepers Creepers, Mimic, Jason-X).May be you'll enjoy it, I didn't. Anyone I talked to who liked this film, don't like horror-movies in general. Persons like me who are big horror-fans, generally find this movie a weak and boring film.Skip this, get Jeepers Creepers instead."
2,OOOOOver-hyped...,"Wow...thought this was going to be MUCH better than it was...with so many critics putting this and its Japanese counterpart-Ringu-on their top 10 or 50 or whatever scariest films I thought this would be a classic...nope...certainly not...while there are some well done moments that build suspense, the story itself is such a mishmash of different ideas you really don't care--and the twist at the end?? That the main character went through all this stuff trying to help out a girl ghost who is actually evil?!? That was massively tacked on, as though the filmmaker/author was trying to one up the run of ""twist"" movies like 6th Sense and others...Overall it was a waste Naomi Watts' good looks and mediocre acting, neither scary nor fulfilling..."
3,"Cause, but little effect","This film has mood and mystery, a decent cast, an interesting production design--with a filtered effect that makes most of the scenes look as if they were shot under water. It's intriguing but, ultimately, a terrific letdown. There is no viable resolution or explanation for the premise set at the outset. As a mood piece with some clever effects, this is worth watching. If you're looking for a film that travels from A to Z, don't go with this one. It goes from A to about H ... and then leaves you scratching your head in bemusement."
4,Mrs. Robert E. Lee,"I found this book to be well written and the author to be very sympathetic to his subject. His vivid descriptions of Arlington were fascinating, too. It's interesting, too, simply because of the lack of information about Mary Lee; she herself may not have been a pivotal figure, but like Mary Lincoln, she was somebody who survived in the heart of many pivotal events."
1,Hate it,"I've been doing dance dvds since I've got a barbie vhs one when I was 8. This is by far the worse I've got. I've done Hi-Lo before at the gym. the moves were hard unless you've done dane before. The music was too soft and Rob Gllick w as soft spoken without showing any energy. After 15 minutes I stopped it. If you want a dance dvd, i recommand a Richard Simmons one. Do not purchase this. It's a waste of money. Mine's going in the trash."
4,Marvelous,"Mark Smylie does what few in fantasy dare. He builds a world, peoples it with well rounded characters, ditches the stereotypes, creates economies, religions, political structures, and myths. What he doesn't do is offer up hack-work fantasy. You feel that the world and the people that live there have a purpose and a life beyond the page. This is no lifeless, racially pure, pseudo-historical, Tolkien wanna-bee. You want that find yourself 100 on the shelves right know. The writing is solid, and doesn't draw attention to itself with hipster, overly heavy, staccato Bendis-nonsense."
3,Not one of his better efforts,"Although Kool Moe Dee is one of the greatest MCs of all time, this is not one of his best efforts. A couple of the songs are OK, but most just seem like filler. This record is only for diehard Moe Dee fans."
3,Moe Dee's Last is solid,"Maybe not as vicious and cool as his earlier work but a nice listen nevertheless! If you're a true fan, you'll listen to it."
4,"Security, The Mario Way","When it comes to video games, the Nintendo DS has really defined the new way we play games on the go. While there are so many games available for the system, it is very difficult to find a simple way to store them all. These Nintendo DS Mario Game Cases is a very sleek and simple way to store all your favorite Nintendo DS Game Cards. Each one fits like a single glove and comes in your favorite standard traditional Mario characters including mario, Peach and Luigi. The cases also come with a extra Nintendo DS stylus that is good for the original Nintendo DS and the DS Lite that works well, and is very reliable to play along with all your favorite games. While the stylus cases are individual and not a multi-pack like other ones, it is a affordable and convient way to store your games at a moderate price that is a real treat for all your DS needs.Price: BStorage: B-DS Stylus: AOverall: B"
2,Nothing Exceptional,"The text is adquate, but it's pretty hard to forgive sub-par illustration in an Osprey title. Christa Hook's work is relentlessly dreary. I was never enamored of Angus McBride's moody take on the Macedonian army in Osprey 148 (The Army of Alexander the Great), but aesthetically it's still superior to what is to be found here."
4,Tinsel Me!,"There are many books about cracking the code to air-tight worlds of media. Publishing, Fashion, music, movies, TV. There are similarities between each and you can usually gleen a few nuggets of insight from them. What I appreciated most about this book is its over-arching organization. There is a flow to it; a logical progression. I'm not in AA, but I imagine there are similarities between the precarious nature of being a recovering addict and taking the leap of faith into the life of an artist or performer. The 12 steps outlined here are ones you use as guideposts; something to hold on to and refer back to again and again when you are uncertain what to do next. If you slip up in a step, you simply back up correct it later.I'd love to be a star and I'll work my ass off for it. But this book doesn't promise that. It's simply a guide to becoming a working professional in the epicenter of an extremely competitive industry. It's worth a read."
5,On The Inside,"""Twelve Step Plan To Becoming An Actor In LA"" will not only help you get a job, it will help you get a life. In addition to teaching you how to get agents and auditions, it teaches you how to become part of an artistic community in LA. After reading this book, you will never feel like you are on the outside looking in!--April Lerman, ""Charles In Charge"""
4,Not acknowledged,"Osho had a beautifully simple way of expressing what he wanted to say. Even though we do use our intuition we are loathe to acknowledge how significant a role it plays in our lives. We live in a world where the left brain is regarded as god, yet it can only spurt forth facts. Our right brain, our limbic brain and our prefrontal lobe have far more to offer that is of value if only we give them the space to be heard. Osho weaves lovely funny stories in amongst his book that helps illustrate what he is wanting us to understand. Wonderful!Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
4,watch,instructions were not totally clear on how to set the voice & itwas not easy getting contact with the seller but once I did theywere quick to give me easy steps to get the watch working whichmy father loves.
3,Fair to good,"Having had the opportunity to grow up in Brasil in the Northeast when Luiz was in his hay-day, I can appreciate this CD. I have another of his CDs which I also enjoy. I'm still looking for a CD with some of his other hits. This particular CD may not strike the fancy of those who don't appreciate regional (Northeastern) Brasilian music of this type. Luiz has left this life but his music lives on."
2,Easy Web Pages (Claris),"The book is a valuable basic primer but could provide some more advanced information. The steps could be more clearly explained. If you need a basic primer, it is worthwhile."
4,Couldn't really tell the difference,"I'm no hard-core bird watcher, but I bought these anyway to replace a cheap old set of 8x32's I had received as an upgrade to the hand-me-downs I received from my father. Honestly, I couldn't tell a difference. Yeah, they're nice. But for occasional use, I can't see spending the $80+. Returned these to Amazon."
4,Nice pair of binoculars for the price.,I purchased these binoculars mainly for the purpose of watching football games from my upper level seats. The view of the field is very sharp and clear. During night games the view through them is surprisingly very bright. It seems to gather in light very well. For a full size binoculars it's not as bulky as I thought it would be. To me it's just a little bigger than a pair of compact binoculars. Only problem I had with them is that they were a little heavy as they hung around my neck. And because of the weight I had to really hold it steady with two hands if I wanted to keep the image I was looking from shaking. Other than that I was happy with the binoculars overall.
3,Okay Hard drive but...,"As for the price, this is very nice hard drive. It has free space of 232GB and installation was not problem and it was shipped fast as well. This is quite light and design is pretty cool too.However, the high pitch distracting sound (apart from the normal hard drive fan sound) gets my nerves often especially when I use it for a long time. Just reminds me when I took ear tests in high school. Remember those quiet but high pitch sound? Also the hard drive gets quite hot after an hour or so and it makes you feel like turning it off just in case the hard drive breaks all the files saved, (which happened to a lot of my buddies)."
3,probably not the correct item I was looking for,"I'm afraid I ordered the wrong product. Previously, I had a Joico Body Luxe product that was a ""leave-in""conditioner.The directions on the product I received said to apply it and then rinse it out.The service and the shipping time was fine however."
3,Not bad - needs real ROM-based development,"OK for basic knowledge - not enough ROM, JTAG, and I/O. Not to mention too little on alternative link maps and data storagemethodologies for mimimal motion"
2,Better stuff out there.,"This is the best of Jay Robert Nash's generally not very good volumes of crime history. It has a wonderful bibliography, probably including hundreds of books, pamphlets, documents, articles, etc., that Nash hasn't read, and a magnificent collection of photos, maybe the best anywhere. Other than making a good doorstop, however, that's about the best that can be said of this book. It's literally strewn with errors and also borrows shamelessly, from such books as Capone by John Kobler and The Bad Ones by Lew Louderback. If you're looking for a good historical crime encyclopedia, pass this one up and go to The Encyclopedia of American Crime by Carl Sifakis."
4,bloodletters and badmen,Excellent details if you really are interested in the true story versus the Hollywwood version.Other people have read and purchased the book after thumbing thru my copy.They thought it was a fine book also.
4,Bloodletters & Badmen Release 1995,This is the 2nd copy I've owned. 1st copy 'vanished' while in the service (vintage 1972-76)version (POST 'OJ')! Appears to be NOT the case!soupboy54@mchsi.com
1,Pure garbage.,I have often wondered how books like this ever land on the non-fiction shelves. This book is so full of inaccurate and flat wrong information that it is a crime. Nash should be held accountable for this trash.
1,Purple prose and cheap research,"Typical stuff from Nash, one of the premier hacks of our time. Old tales openly lifted from other sources get retold with a lot of tabloid style writing and occasional adherence to facts. There are so many better books out there on crime and criminals. If you care about good writing and solid research, avoid this one!"
4,Sure to delight,With kids toys being so much about brands and high tech capability - this whimsical and imaginative book is such a delight. I can't wait for my son to see it on Christmas day. Adults I have shown it to have enjoyed it too.
3,Good for kids,This is a good starter for children or people with very little knowlage of the middle ages. As that it has some detale and walkthroughs of old English castles and an animated story running parrell to the narative.
4,Castle,"This may be an older historical program than many others out there today, but it's still relevant and a product of superior quality. Rather than being a boring regurgitation of facts and dates, Castle tells the story of the creation of a medieval castle while highlighting construction techniques and the quality of life of those who lived in its shadow. I bought this for my son who is already a fan of Tolkien, dragons and such, and absolutlely devoured this."
1,This Book Should Be Banned.,I never before in my 28 years have read a book more useless and pathetic than this. The business ideas are a real joke. Hardly any of these ideas could be developed into an real business. Whatever you do DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. You would be better off buying an 1975 map of south Mississippi. It could help you start a business better than this book. I will sell you my copy for [money amount](the cost of a small bundle of fire wood).
4,Good for the price,"These were decent for what we paid. We bought these for use on a recent safari and whale watching excursion. They got the job done, but were no substitute for a really good pair had we wanted to use them more frequently."
1,Book perpetuates the myth that autistics are invalids,"About eight years ago I was very heavily into the Baby-Sitter's Club, as were many people my age. This was one book many of us read back in middle school. Last year I was diagnosed with autism. I have a more mild form of the disease, which is the case for the majority of autistics. Unfortunately, many people still believe that autistics are unreachable, locked in their own world. The case of the girl in this book is extremely rare. My best friend had heard of autism from this book. When I told her I had it, she refused to believe me because this picture of a helpless girl was what this book had given her. Needless to say, her response was very hurtful. Please do those of us with autism a favor and don't read this book without the full knowledge that it is not accurate. Better yet, leave this book on the shelf; it isn't worth your time."
4,6 Year Old Gamer and his Mom.,"I purchased this game for my son last Christmas (age 5). This game is a favorite of his. He really enjoys the car racing with all of Mickeys friends. The graphics are great, the cars are easy to recognize. The track continually gets harder with ramps, water and secret short cuts, with each level. My son, when playing this game will usually sit for 45 min. to an hour. ""Disney"" did it again, GREAT game and age appropriate. Your young children will enjoy this game. Watch out for Minnie she likes to win!"
2,Young feet,They are very hard in the inside when walking in them so if you plan to walk in them for awhile you better go to Target/Wal-mart and get some cushioned insoles for comfort and they look like knock offs.
1,Horrible quality!,My husband bought a set of this jwelry for my birthday in June and I loved it! But today I found the silver chain turns into totally BLACK! I only weared them twice for my birthay and my friend's wedding and I kept them in their little boxes very well! Only two month they become so ugly! I am very upset and I never see any jwelry has such bad quality! The whole set costs us more than hundred dollars! Feel very very BAD!
3,"Read this cover carefully,","I enjoy the Yoga Zone series for most part and already own a few titles. Before you buy this one, double check and make sure you don't have the Introduction to Yoga title as this would just duplicate it in your library. I'm not a bit fan of companies changing the covers to old titles, but at least this one has the meditiation dvd with it, which is why I gave it three stars."
5,BUY IT,"Arrived in a timely manner. This book is great, I love it. I already owned a copy and bought this one for my son... so much to learn how food plays such a large role in your health! Has some recipes in it too. GREAT"
2,"dealer great, price very correct.","the dealer was very prompt and the item was in great condition. the price was correct as the book was over hyped, but not by the dealer."
1,food remedies?,"Oh Come on. I've been reading/following this religiously for the last 8 months and have NO relief for my ailments. And I don't mean serious like cancer, just the measurable things like allergies and joint pain. What's up? Ever hear of quack medicine?"
4,Perfect Camera Bag,"I bought this camera bag for my Canon Powershot 600. It was perfect! I am a big fan of anything lightweight and not a nuisance or bulky to carry around. With the adjustable strap, you can easily put it around your neck or carry it on your shoulder. It even has a loop in the back of the pouch so that you can carry it on your belt. It also has a small pocket on the inside to maybe put in another memory card for the camera or extra battery pack. Definitely worth the price."
5,Would like to purchase,This looks very promising -- reminds me of Leverage. I would LOVE to purchase this series if/when amazon ever makes it available.
1,Be wise....,"Christians that may be reading this book need to know that although various parts of the Bible may be interpreted a little differently (not changing the truth of it) by its various readers, there is one way to know if someone has an incorrect interpretation. If an interpretation doesn't outright oppose what God says then it can be considered another valid personal viewpoint/interpretation. But if the interpretation is ""just the opposite"" of what God says, then beware. Since this book has everything to do with the Bible, then the readers here should know who God reveals as His chief Opposer, speaking the opposite of what God says. So as you read this book, be careful to see if the author teaches the same message that God gives in the verses or just the opposite."
5,What a Hoot!,"I needed this final season to round out my Paris collection... Its like owning every ZsaZsa Gabor movie! I love Paris and its so cool to see this campy collection of hers! She has retreated from the lime-light, but we can remember her in her glory days! Big smoochies Paris! Loveit!"
5,A must for those that love prog rock. Period.,"Trying to find something to quench my thirst for new and inventive prog rock the likes of Dream Theater, I decided to give this album a spin. The benchmark for album greatness is how long it stays in the car (no CD-changer). This album is unbelievably good. The vocals are just phenomenal not only lead but harmonics as well. I am a drummer and praise the handy work of all of the musicians. This album is not an example of ""the fastest, the hardest, the longest"" but is a series of very well-thought out songs painting a bigger picture throughout. I really hope that you enjoy it as much as I have. It is five weeks and it is not leaving my car just yet."
5,The Best of Applied Linguistic Research at your Service,"I have extensive experience in language learning, including graduate level courses in Applied Linguistics. I shied away from Pimsleur for years because I scoff at the (usually unfounded) claims that this or that method will have you speaking a language in no time. Finally, with limited time and a desire to learn Russian via a full-audio method, I tried Pimsleur. I am now starting comprehensive Russian II and give Pimsleur courses to committed language learners as gifts. Its secret -- a good method underpinned with the best of 50+ years of applied linguistic research, classroom experience and common sense. For many languages, the best materials were developed during World War II and never significantly improved afterward. I wish Pimsleur existed in levels I thru III in ALL languages! Be diligent, listen to each tape 3 or 4 times, give yourself 4 months per level, and you shall speak!"
4,Better than I thought,"I hesitated in buying this game, but glad I did. Has so many colors and also has the option of coloring by numbers or letters. There is also sparkle crayola and animated pictures. Very nice for kids 8 and under."
5,This book is perfect:,"A must have for anyone interested in developing your own Black & white film. Clear, concise. Step by step with no holes in any of the developing procedures. I probably wouldn't of started my own darkroom if it wasn't for this book. Get it!"
2,"What is Neural Network? To be frank, I can't understand.","This book tells you 3 kinds of forecasting method namely The Rule-Based Approach, the Knowledge-based Approach and the Neural Network Approach.The most important message that this books wants to deliver is the Neural Network Approach. To be frank, I have read this book twice but I still cannot understand what Neural Network is. The most difficult part is that the author mentioned that Neural Network has to be ""trained"" but unfortunately he did not clearly explain how the training works. This book eventually taught me nothing new about horse racing forecasting. I am quite disappointed after reading this book."
1,The TRUE story??? Not by a long shot!,"How can the author claim to write the ""true story"" of the Osage murders without citing ANY research documentation whatsoever? Obviously, Hogan did not interview any Real Osages, nor has he visited the Osage Museum or the Whitehair Memorial. This book is yet another attempt by a white person to recreate Osage history from his own perspective and call it factual. And, as far as selling ""thousands of copies"" of the book, well, that does not establish its veracity. As an academician, I cannot endorse this book. No research, no interviews, no inclusion of Real Osage accounts = no true story. Finally, I take exception to the publisher's attack on the only other person who wrote a review similar to mine. A review should be just that--an opinion of a text's quality (or in this case, failure). This book does nothing but perpetuate negative stereotypes of Osage Indians. In any case, the subtitle should instead read ""One White Man's Fictionalized Account..."""
2,Mediocre at best,"While this Lonely Planet Guide is a decent enough guide filled with the ""usual suspect"" type of attractions, hotel and restaurant info, I must agree with ""A Reader from Long Island"" (Australian comment aside) that this guide is disappointing. Yes, it seems well researched regarding some of the historical aspects of the area... (but who really gets a travel guide for a history lesson?) However if you are a frequent traveller to Vegas like myself you'll do better with a more off-the-beaten-path guide such as the ""Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas."" I mean really, to list chain establishments that are pretty much nationwide such as Applebee's and Krispy Kreme as ""Killer Vegas Eateries"" does no one a service and shows a lack of imagination. Give us a real taste of Sin City! Hey Avant Guide, when are you gonna hit the Strip and show us something new and exciting?"
4,Intriguing Book,"I am reluctant with most modern fiction to give 5 stars; it's always difficult to predict how well a novel will bear up over time, compared to the classics. However, I'd be inclined to give this a higher rating. I have read it twice and find the depiction of the protagonist intriguing. She is presented warts and all, cranky, demanding, contradictory, hungry, humorous, self effacing and talented. She seems like such a modern heroine, unlike the others in Gordon's typical novels. She is like the women I have known. The book presents her perspective well, showing her vacillating motives and desires. It sets up a great situation and unwinds it in fascinating ways. Yes, it has a pat, all-too-convenient plot development concerning money, but one can see why the author wanted to show a side of the protagonist that might have been difficult to spotlight otherwise. I was reminded of the Erica Jong books I read as a teen, before Jong got so exhibitionistic."
5,Enthralling...entrancing...exciting,"Curled up in a chair at the local book superstore, I read (devoured?) SPENDING completely at the retailer's expense....but I could not bear to leave the store without having the book in my possession. I bought the book (and a copy for my best friend). My often re-read favorites are a security blanket on my bookshelves at home, and Mary Gordon's latest is a most satisfactory addition. I admired Gordon's wit and sarcasm, laughed out loud with her humor, and exalted in her feminine intelligence. SPENDING is enveloping and very very sexy."
2,If you don't speak Korean,"This is a great series and the video quality itself is very good. However, the subtitles in English are an incoherent mess of of poor interpretation, sentence structure and word choice. It is nearly impossible to follow along most of the time. When we watched this on the SBS channel, the English was much better. It is perhaps the worst dubbing I have ever seen in my lifetime."
2,Almost not comprehensible,"TOTALLY AGREE with the HORRIBLE subtitles --trully a 'mess' as Mr. Givens above has reviewed. You are better off to watched the fan-dubbed versions online. i was very embarassed to share this with my family with the horrendous english subs. i myself am asian and am pretty forgiving about 'bad' english but this one bites the cake. I cannot even begin to address how bad the English is here from misuse of pronouns and prepositions to word choice to nonsense sentences/phrases due to lack of punctuation marks. It is really that bad to the point that had i not watched the fan-dubbed versions online, I would NOT have understood this kdrama. DO NOT BUY!"
5,Loved it,"After hearing about it and getting the pilot, I decided to get the whole season as well!Really liked it, seeing thes different characters being put together in this unit. Different people with different backgrounds. Also you can see what happens to the people left behind and how they deal with their partners being over there.Read that it's not really like that over there, but I think it gives us not-military people some insight."
1,Pure crap - From a Vet,Dont insult real soldiers by watching this over the top crap. If you want to experience what war is like then join the military. Don't have the stomach for that then watch Generation Kill.
3,Baywatch...The Iraq Years,"The fighting scenes are great, the soldier interaction seems good enough, but i can't escape the feeling that I'm watching Baywatch, or Pacific Blue. Everyone cast is handsome/beautiful, the homefront scenes are WAY too dramatic and predictable, and nudity is shown (not full) for no good reason except obviously for ratings. plus the production made everything just a little too clean to be believed.I'd say in general, this series is just a little too ""T.V."".I wish HBO could do a series similar to Band of Brothers about Iraq."
1,unreliable,"We have had 2 of these BD Rapid (not flex) thermometers in the last few years. We threw the first one out over a year ago because the temperature consistently read far too low, rarely getting above 97.2 for either my husband or myself. Recently we purchased another BD Rapid thermometer without realizing it was the same one we had tried before. We decided to go ahead and try it again, but this thermometer was the same, never showing a temperature above 97.4. I compared the BD to the reading I had in the doctor's office today and it was a full 1.5 degrees too low. I cannot recommend these thermometers."
2,"Janacek's Vixen, de-toothed","It's too bad that Dunbar and crew decided to shorten the opera and aim it at the children's market. The story, in its original form, has sharp teeth. The profundity of Janacek's opera lies in its contrast of mundane and morose humans with the super-*natural* animals, and at 90 minutes, it's succinct. Dunbar -- citing a need to bring the story in under an hour -- focuses pretty much on the cute animals. Worse, the denuded score is sung in a wan, timid style. Janacek's music, though far from Germanic, still demands passion of its singers. On the plus side, there are some nicely animated sequences, and the animation is above-par for today's market. Those who buy this DVD should consider introducing themselves to the *real* work via the MacKerras CD or (perhaps even better) the EMI/Rattle CD, which is in a superior english translation."
4,Great Gift for new Yorkie Owner,"This book has so many suggestions what to expect from a Yorkie personality.I would suggest a person buy this book before you bring home the new Yorkie puppy, so you can begin training immediatley--and the right way."
4,though unrealistic a nice read,"it was nice getting a glimpse of claudia's detective and teaching skills and a sense of her fashion taste and how cool she is. This girl needed to realize that she was the bomb and the most exciting one in the family! And grades are nothing, there is more to life than school. You know how many things are not taught in school?"
3,Front fine back not so fine,I received the garnet earrings in the same style as a Christmas gift and by the end of January I had to take them to a repair shop to have the broken backs repaired. The earrings look great but you must be very gentle in putting them on.
4,HEART OF THE Wilderness,This book was well written and very believable. I do like how the Lord and salvation message was woven into the storyline. Heartwarming and showed the strong love of family.
3,A Great Read,"I have loved this series. Each book is far different than the others. To me, this ended rather abruptly, but I'm still glad I read it."
5,Able to keep up my Nikon D50 shots,"As they said, poor men pay twice. Don't buy the regular SD card for your digital SLR. Get the one supports higher write speed. I shoot RAW+JPEG with a Nikon D50, this SD card can keep up with my continuously rapid firing without a problem. I used a cheaper regular SD card before and I needed to wait for a couple of seconds after 2nd or 3rd shot. Highly recommended."
5,Affirmative Reaction affirmed,"I polished off Affirmative Reaction by Aileen Schumacher in one day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course, I am a big fan of hers anyway, but I think that each book gets better. This one had a great combination of humor and suspense and a great opening line: She figured it came down to a choice between going to work or committing murder.Aileen switches emphasis between her main character and the man who would like to be her significant other. I love the shifting between the two though I know that such is not to everyone's taste. But it makes it much more believable to me on how this amateur detective gets involved in the homicides.Highly recommended."
1,Bushnell Elite 3200 10x40 (Piece of Crap),"I will never buy another Bushnell.Brand new 1 week old, it wouldnt adjust for windage.Sent it to Bushnell, they held it for 3 weeks.Finally they shipped it back to Texas, only problem is they didnt bother putting the information regarding building number and suite number, Now it cant be delivered, Bushnell has been non responsive, UPS will only take corrections from Bushnell.Apparently none of the info I sent them made it into the UPS instruction, no phone numbers, no building number, no suite number.If only I had it to do over again, it wouldnt be a BUSHNELL piece of crap."
3,"Review of Lovejoy's ""Revolt Against Dualism""","A very detailed review of the history of the philosophical debate between monism and Dualism and the philosophers on both sides of the issue. While somwhat difficult reading, persistence will be rewarded with increased understanding of this important issue. A classic in the field and deserves meticulous reading by anyone interested in this most important philosophical issue."
3,power in retirement,Good information to support my choice to 'retire' early. A little too religious for me. The author lost a lot of points with me when he quoted Shaw. Shaw was a socialist; there's no room in my world for that.
4,Pretty tough!,"WOW! I really like this game! It was pretty difficult for my 7 year old to get a grip on, but once he got going it was great. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 6 or 7. It's great fun for a grown up without spending the time and effort it takes to do the ""SR"" version :)"
1,Waste of time and money,"I read other people's reviews of this game and I find it hard to beleive that a 5-year-old (much less anyone younger) can really play this game. They are probably playing their own ""version"" of it. It is way more complicated than regular Clue and actually put me in a bad mood trying to play it. Only a 5-year-old in MENSA could actually figure out how to use strategy in this game."
2,Seems Boring,"Well, i had recently purchased this game on April 9. it is expected april 13- 14. I read the reveiws and now i don't want this game. I plan on returning it and buying Clue. I had no idea it was for kids ages 4-8. none of my sisters are that age. I thought Clue would be hard thats why i purchased this game for my 9 year old sister and my self(12). now if i just read the instructions for clue i might find it easy. So if your s parent you should buy this only if your children are 5&6 otherwise they'll find it boring! So i guess I'll just have to return it!"
1,Not a Very Good Book,"This book was terrible! It hardly provided any useful information or insight into Cobain's life. The book did not leave any opening for readers to form their own opinions about Cobain. According to this book, Cobain was just another self-destructive rock star who eventually committed suicide. Anyone who knows anything about Nirvana and Kurt Cobain would not enjoy this book. As for readers who are not familiar with Cobain, be cautious when reading. Some things in the book are not even backed by sources. There were nice color pictures, however they were of no relevance to the story."
1,A CHILDREN'S book about Kurt Cobain?,"I never read this before. In fact, I never even knew that this existed... until now. Someone actually wrote a Kurt Cobain book for ELEMENTARY school kids?! Why?"
4,Nice but small,"Bought this case for a Fuji F10 and it is too small. However, it is such a nice case I decided to keep for a smaller camera."
3,Good but...,"I got this for my Canon G9, a somewhat bulky and heavy model. The case fits the camera just fine but, like others, I decided to cut off the heavy flap and remove the velcro spot. Doing a careful job with a brand new utility knife doesn't detract from the appearance at all. As to quality, after a few months of use, the main compartment zipper came loose from one side. It looks like I can re-sew it back in but it isn't the standard of quality I expect from Lowe."
1,"Great quote book, not-so-great career advice","Boldt strings together quotes and cliches with the dexterity of a high school debate team captain. It's like he's sleeping with a copy of Bartlett's Quotations under his pillow. But as anyone who's listened to a high school debate knows, ""proof by quotation"" does not make for a compelling argument. It's actually pretty tiring to read. You keep waiting for the wisdom, the enlightening bits, the heart of the book. It never comes.If you want career advice, or are seeking your life's calling, you'd be better off reading Po Bronson, Barbara Sher, Richard Bolles, Marsha Sinetar, Nancy Anderson, or heck, even Dr. Phil! Or better yet, get a good career counselor, coach, or therapist to help you face to face, step by step.Save yourself the effort on this one..."
3,Isadora Duncan,"This is a good but very dated movie. Also the quality of this DVD is not of the best. It appears ans a blurred movie, although the sound is good and the plot is also very good, including her bizaar death.I did purchase this movie from Amazon.Com, which is my favorite source for all books and movies and countless other products but Amazon .Com has revolutionized the book and movie businesses, gone are the days of hunting down movies and books in dusty heaps in old used odds and end stores, now I find the hardest-to-locate boos and movies literally in minutes!"
1,Worst one of these I've tried,"I was so hopeful that the Transdock would be the ipod transmitter of my dreams. Will work with my Nano now and work with my new iPod Touch when I get one AND charge my cell phone - what could be better?Not this thing. I've had a Belkin for some time and that one was good, held a frequency well, well made, etc. But it only worked with the Nano.This one with it's multiple articulating arms seems like a good idea if you want to install a squeek in your car and if you don't want it to transmit well. Additionally, it would turn off and on exactly once every minute. I contacted DLO customer support and clearly worded the problem. I asked if this is the way it works or do I have a defective unit. After no less than 10 'go rounds' of them asking me the same questions I had answered in my original email, they finally said I should return it for a new one.Ugh!"
3,Not Bad For a FM Transmitter but Same Old Thing,Most people know about these things by now but if not do not buy this for the looks alone. You need to consider the type of vehicle this is for. If you need to use the extension bar for your cigarette lighter then you should look elsewhere. It is noisy and bulky and seems to be putting a strain on my power source. I mean noisy by squeaky when I drive. I am returning this and going the hardwire route. I will no longer put up with this FM transmitter fad. Many car audio places have ipod solutions for many vehicles so you get a true ipod digital experience without this FM modulator stuff.Bottom line do not get this if you have a truck and need to use the extension bar.
4,Strong signal,"The TransDock fulfilled my expectation regarding signal strength. My previous transmitter was extremely hissy, so this is what I was looking for. The structure is a bit flimsy, mostly due to the fact that the 12V connector where the dock is inserted is not usually made for this purpose, and the weight of the iPod/Dock combination makes the connector arm shake. This may also depend on the car that you're driving. However the iPod has not fallen off the dock at any time."
1,Not so good,"To people who are not Christians. The book is written by FamilyLife, a nono-profit ministry. You should read Forward or Introduction before you buy."
4,Un gran compositor,"Este disco es en realidad una selección de 2 discos de Joo: Galos de briga (1976) y Linha de passe (1979). En él podemos apreciar principalmente el genio compositivo de Bosco. Hay grandes temas que popularizara Elis Regina como ""O bebado e a equilibrista"", ""Transversal do tempo"", ""Gol anulado"" y ""O rancho da goiabada"", aquí cantados por su autor. Melodías apasionantes, armonías perfectas y -quizás el punto más flojo- arreglos de la época, hacen de este disco un infaltable para una buena discoteca de Música Popular Brasileira."
3,Great as a disposable pen.,"The Cross Morph writes very well and is as comfortable a pen as any to use. The problem is the durability of the soft rubber grip lasts for about the duration of the ink... expect 4-6 months of heavy use. At that point the rubber grip will likely take on a significantly different shape depending on how you write. After another refill, the rubber will have broken down. So its not like a traditional Cross pen in that aspect, but still, as a disposable pen it was a joy to use. You can occasionally find these for under $15, and for that price they make more sense."
4,I love this warmer and wax,It works fantastically. I used it on my legs and it was incredibly simple. Much cheaper than going to a salon. The only thing that would make it better would be if it was easier to remove
2,Messy and Sticky,"The wax warmer works well and heats the wax up to a decent temperature. Unfortunately, the wax can get everywhere and it gets very sticky and messy. I have found that baby oil and warm water can remove the wax but, for convenience, it would be much easier to just use cold wax."
4,Still the standard,"There is no doubt this is a difficult book with a great deal of repetition. It is difficult to absorb. However, the riots themselves are a confusing and very difficult chapter in American history. It is important for a serious student of New York City history to read this book. Whether you enjoy the tome or not remains to be seen, but it is an absolute essential if you are going to speak seriosly about the 1863 Draft Riots, and the events that followed. Check it out and be prepared to study!"
1,huge disapointment,"This is a 5 disc set, but there are only 2 shows on 4 of the discs, and bio on the 5th about hollywood couples.I bought it for $18, but I still felt ripped off. I bought a Burns and Allen DVD at the dollar store with more episodes than this. 18 bucks for 8 episodes is pretty high priced!"
2,Some good points but strange philosophy,"Probably best for the single parent mother trying to raise a boy, we start from the premise that you want to run first, then talk, then defend yourself. Unfortunately there is little evidence that running will do more than encourage a bully and talk is nice in theory but I never saw it work other than as a diversion. The escape techniques are excellent and there is no information which could offend even the person soft as baby poop. Personally I suggest a more direct approach, but in some situations this would be balanced. I find a frightening lack of realism about the school yard where kids today may be armed, or junkies or both. Kids must understand that even the LEO will avoid confrontation with an armed junkie until there are reinforcements.Overall, I would strongly recommend it where Dad can sit down with son and/or daughter while watching it and discuss family philosophy about violence viewed from the oppressed and as viewed by the oppressor."
4,"casual, yet elegant","Nice earrings, with a simple garment they look casual, with an elegant outfit they look elegant too! A bit bigger than what they seem on the photo. Liked them very much. Thanks!"
2,Not for the Lumix ZS3,"If you own the Lumix ZS3 the Rexo 30 camera bag is not a good companion. It is too small for the camera, a tight fit in and a tight fit out. The velcro flap serves only the secondary slot for the backup battery so it is not something you can use to enclose the camera. With the camera in the bag you can close the zipper....almost. A struggle whenever you would want the camera since you will need to close the zipper if you want to avoid the possibility of it falling out (which might be ironic since it is pretty hard to extract). Get something bigger. Mine went back the same day. Not suitable and it would be good if Amazon were not suggesting the pairing."
2,"Zipper mechanism is not smooth, it catches.","I was enthused by many of the reviews, but disappointed that the zipper mechanism wasn't smooth enough; this proved impractical as fighting to get the camera out, esp. for a shot that you see, is something that didn't appeal to me. I have a slightly larger LowePro case for my other digital camera and the zipper mechanism is as smooth as butter and never catches (that is, you don't have to fight with it to get the case open). I wish that the zipper mechanism worked as good on the Rezo 30 model."
1,camera bag,"This bag can only be opened by a zipper on the top. I was very disappointed, because I have an older Lowepro camera bag that opened by velcro and it was extremely easy to get the camera out. This one is useless to me. It's very hard to open the zipper and very hard to get the camera in and out. I gave it away to someone. I will not purchase a camera bag through Amazon again because it is important to see it. By the picture, you can't tell how hard it is to open. Also, the zipper will scratch the camera every time you take it out. As with many things, the Lowepro older design was much better."
1,Annoying text and ugly pictures,"My 3 year old daughter didn't seem to mind this book, but I hate it. The repetitive phrases are irritating and the pictures are ugly. On each page there is hardly any content packed into a forced rhyme in the following format:*VERSE PAGE*locationwhat can you see doing some actioninane focus on the verb of the previous linebasically repeat line 2*CHORUS PAGE*annoying lyricannoying lyric againannoying lyric yet againpretty much copy line 2 from the verseI won't even recycle this book as a gift to someone else... it's going in the bin."
2,Inane,"This book reads like it was written by a first grader. I know it's a children's book, but the text lacks any sort of originality or imagination. The first two paragraphs are repeated throughout the entire book, with only a couple words changed. It seems like these days, you don't have to be a good writer to write a children's book, you just need a cute gimmick."
5,"Please read it again, Mom?","A sure-fire indication of a hit--I read this book nine times (eight by request) the first day we got it. My 2 year old loves it, and was dancing around the house singing ""boogie, woogie, oogie"" tonight. A brightly colored, fun book...definitely worth having."
3,Me Too Womens's Sassy Mary Janes,The shoes are comfortable. My concern is the dye used on the leather. It doesn't seem to hold the color. I purchased the black shoes and it is too light. My plan is to put black shoe polish on the shoe to improve the color but I am worried the light stitching might be lost to the dye.
4,a rare look at Tull,This is a good show if you love Tull has a lot of music that was on the A album which is out of print now and a good look at what Tull was like back in the 70to 80s hard to find if you see it get is fast
5,Cross-country ski film of the year,"I saw ""On Snow"" at a mountain adventure film festival where it received rave reviews, and just picked up the video version. What it is not, is your typical nordic ski video. My non-skiing friends were glued to the screen. The mountain skate-skiing action scenes were rivoting. The video consists of a dozen scenes which are intended to cover the tastes of every nordic skier: wild Warren-Miller-like rock video on skis, world loppet, national sprint champs, kids, the world's longest ski tour, and a dryland to on snow technique bonus. It is not intended to be a technique video but there is some great skiing by pro elite and olympic skiers, notiably a two-time Olympic biathlete. The sound track is most cool: industrial techno, gothic rock guitar, rave, pop, and jazz. Overall ""On Snow"" is serious motivating material."
2,Average at best,"I have read the entire Courtney series, and am a big fan of Wilbur Smith. This book although it tries to make a statement about the slave trade etc, misses the mark entirely. It's almost like this was the first book he ever write. You can see how Smith is trying to get the reader to love certain characters and hate others, but it just doesn't happen.The book also goes on far too long and when I got to the final 5%, I just wanted it over. Normally I am anxious to see what happens, but in this instance I just didn't care.Hate giving Smith a bad review, but this book just doesn't do it. I have found one or two of his previous books did miss the mark as well. I guess we all have off books."
5,Naruto seadon 4.1,My son loves Naruto shippudon and is really enjoying all of these early naruto's and being able to see where the current charecters came from.
2,A very frustrating read....,"At 238 pages, this book is about 100 pages too long. Every once in a great while, there are peaks of interest...unfortunately, they usually lead nowhere. I can appreciate an author painting a canvas just as much as the next guy, but I regularly found myself skimming entire chapters. My advice....move on."
5,Can't say enough good things...,"Can't say enough good things about this book. I didn't want to do anything but sit and read it. Excellent story about self-discovery, first love, and the worries that face lesbians just coming out."
5,Classic,As relevant today as when I first read it years ago. Two beautiful women and a happy ever after ending. Gotta love it!
3,Piracy in the Ancient World; a review,"This book represents one of the first major efforts to study the phenomenon of piracy in Medeterranean waters during the Greco-Roman era. Ormerod has some success in uniting a horde of disparate sources into a narrative of piracy in this period, no small task. However, analysis of the phenomonon is only made on the most basic of levels, the author failing to find broader trends, and terminologies are hazily established. Without strong defenitions the author is often led into discussing issues of warfare rather than piracy. However, the reviewer found this book to be of immense interest, and despite its failings has shed light on hitherto unknown areas such as the discussion of reprisals in Greek forieign policy. The author has made a commendable effort to bring together a number of difficult pieces of evidence with little prior scholarship to guide him."
3,Fundamentals of Cross Country Skiing Technique,The presentation was very fast so difficult to grasp the points without viewing again and catching info onthe fly. Otherwise OK.
2,Too much glitz and fluff.,"Past reviews showed 5 stars, so I purchased it. The video was too flashy and depended on some distracting animated computer figure that tried to make the video seem ""high tech"". There were attempts to have futuristic ""Star Trek"" type data write ups on the screen. A very impersonal video. There is an unseen background narrator, who ever it is. This video kind of glorifies a good skier and says 'do it like this'. It just does not say how. It also has a bunch of little success sayings about how to succeed that keep popping up on the screen. Very distracting.It would be nice to have a skiing coach point out proper technique and go over what one person is doing right/wrong. I got very little from this video. Too many sweets and not enough meat and potatoes."
3,Decent Movie - Not As Good As The Others,"This was a very funny movie. However, it did not have a lot of the actors and actresses from the other 3 films. I think it would have been better if they brought some of them back. It is worth buying if you are an American Pie Fan."
3,disappointing...,"I was really disappointed in the quality of this work. I expected a very professional, succinct source of information on the play, but was faced with a rather trite summary riddled with grammatical errors. The essay included was slightly helpful, but the rest of the book felt as though I was reading a summary written by a fellow undergrad; I don't purchase a study guide to hear things that someone in my class could have told me."
1,Does NOT fit Coolpix L20 10MP,"I tried to jam my new L20 into this case and almost had to rip the case apart to get it back out. If I had pulled on the strap to get it out, I'm sure the strap would have broken. Yet Amazon suggested this case for the L20, which is why I bought it."
4,case for Nikon S630 Coolpix,"Perfect size case to protect the camera from scratches in a purse and has a magnetic closing flap, and belt loop too. Leather, solid case."
1,Leather Case for Nikon Coolpix L19 Camera,"I bought this camera case as part of the three-pack offered (camera, camera case and memory disk) as a gift and the camera case was way too tight for the camera. I was embarrassed when they went to put the camera in the case and it didn't fit. I expected it to be a snug fit in order to protect the camera, but it didn't even come close to fitting on the camera. Unless I had a one-off case, I can't imagine why this case is being offered with this camera because they aren't close to being a match."
4,Wonderful case,Works great! Only fault is the lack of a strap or something to hold onto. The case is hard so the camera wont get damaged and the magnetic clasp is handy. Highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a camera case. Money makes it an even better find.
5,Nikon Coolpix leather case,"I have a Coolpix S550, and this leather case was the perfct size for it. It fits in my wife's purse for easy storage.Thanks, for a great product & great shipping."
1,Cheap Looking and Flimsy,Got this fo the nikon coolpix - but ended up buying another one a few days later. This one is not worth the money - it is very cheap looking and flimsy.
2,Odd movie,"OK, a cursed immigrant who has snakes inside of her get on a train illegally. Surprise, the snakes get out, others get infected and the fun begins. Well, the snakes were supposed to be of the venonmous variety, but all I saw were garter and pythons, CORNY! Also, you have your typical cast passengers, the drug smugglers, illegal immigrants, dope heads, business people, etc... This movie was just out of control unbelieveable. One snake surpasses the size of the train, gimme a BREAK!!! The acting was kinda poor (altough I've seen worse), the sound was low but the action music was LOUD, that's annoying too. Also, the train looks like it was from the 1970's, so dumpy and unreal looking. I heard snakes on a plane was bad too. I guess I shouldn't have expected more out of this. Don't waste your money, ESPECIALLY 21.99 as Amazon is asking currently. Picking up one for .50-1.00 used is more reasonable."
1,Bad in a Bad Way - One Star,"""Snakes on a Train"" was worse than I expected, and I had my expectations set fairly low. Few sympathetic characters, fewer snakes, and a train-wreck of a climax make this a one-star movie.I didn't really care if any of the characters (except the small child) lived or died. All of the characters were two-legged snakes; let them die. So many characters, so few snakes to kill them. Yawn. Real snakes, albeit tiny ones were present. Some larger snakes appeared later in the movie. And the climax was so ridiculous that it almost made the movie worth another star.The DVD has a Commentary track that explains why certain cinematic choices were made. The directors, editors, and actors all deserve credit for doing a fair to good job, but the movie really doesn't work for me. The script is awful, and ""Snakes in a Train"" does not entertain me as a mockbuster should."
1,un watchable!!!!!,"I must say i can most of the time find something i like about any movie but this was a joke! they used gardener snakes and boas and some racer snakes (all non venomous snakes!)this was a terrible movie the acting sucked the special effects sucked,this was bad for a b-movie! it was not scary in any way! how hard is it to make a movie about being trapped on a train with snakes? if i could give it no stars i would !!!!! do not waste your time!"
3,"Entertaining read, but lacking in depth","I found the book hard to put down -- in fact, I read it straight through in a matter of hours. I was greatly entertained, but found myself hungry for more details. This series of crimes, in my opinion, is unparalleled in regards to cruelty and gruesomeness, with the possible exception of Jeffrey Dahmer's murders. But I was left with many unanswered questions. The book's 316 pages of large type was just not enough to delve into even ONE of these crimes in any real depth, much less all of them, and the trials were skimmed over even faster. All in all, I recommend the book for its entertainment value, but I would think most true crime fans will be left unsatisfied."
2,bushnell banner not,"Going through Amazon as usual is a pleasure . Your service is the best . The scope I'm not pleased with . When you look through it the pitcher is large , bright and crisp until you move your sight plane up down or to the side , then the outside third of the pitcher gets distorted . should of went with my second choice - Redfield 2 x 7 x32 ."
5,Caspian must,"The two authors are very knowledgeable about the region and give the most comprehensive and updated analysis of the Caspian area, covering both the political and economical parameters. The book has an impressive bibliography, which makes it an excellent research tool for whoever is interested in expanding on the subject. Very well written."
1,Scarlet Diva,"I must have missed the greatness of the movie that other reviewers saw. ""Sexually charged and unforgettable cinema experience"" was what I read in some reviews. The movie goes no where in a hurry. Which leaves the viewer wondering what this movie is really about. Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll is always a hard life to keep up with. However, this movie doesn't convey that idea well at all."
5,Vastly intriguing... but not for the reasons you might think...,"""Vincent gallo is a piece of &%$#, but I love him."" So speaks Asia, in that hash-stained voice, monotone... commenting on a scene...The commentary in this film is the high-point, by far. 5 stars for Asia bearing and concealing her soul, piece by piece, on the commentary track... The dialogue is subtitled people, so if you have a half a brain, you can watch it with the subtitles and the commentary... It's a strange ride. I can't imagine this gal's life... The asides and asia's monotone talk are soul-crippling.It has the ring of truth. Definitely for people who feast on the bleaker, unremittingly flinchless side of life... I love this movie, but only with the commentary."
1,not dubbed and no subtitles! almost cried,wanna watch this movie? well u might as well watch it with no sound it is in italian! what are they saying? why release a movie in u.s.a when english people cant understand the film? i waited 2 yrs for this film to be released here! and i cant even watch it enjoyablely!...maybe someday it will get subtitles or get dubbed! im very very disopointed i almost cried when u put the film in and found no english track or subtitles...
1,Noisy pump burned out in less than a week,Even my five-year old playing outdoors complained about the incredibly noisy pump. And then the battery compartment melted! A great idea but lousy execution. Don't buy this toy--wait for something better to come along.
2,Agree- do NOT buy this,"Just adding my two cents. This toy was awesome until it broke quickly. We went through 3 pumps from the company, and now it is on the curb for trash pickup. It really was a fun toy when it was working, but there is something obviously wrong with the pumps and does NOT make sense to buy this toy in its current design. I just tried the last pump a few days ago from the company- so at this writing of this review, this product still does not work."
4,sweet jones,"bun-b is one of the most respected cats in hip-hop and is crazy lyrical too. pimp c (RIP) had some of the illest swagger hip hop has ever seen (I pack an iron e'ry time and i aint tryin die...pssy ngga <--haha, i love dat sht!)this is my favorite album from 07 hands down, and Int'l playas anthem was my favorite banger from the year too. It's groups like UGK that make me wonder how people hate on the south periodI love this album, it still gets pretty heavy rotation on my deck"
2,Where Did It Go So-o-o-o Wrong?,"Take brothers Doug and Rodney of the forward-thinking bluegrass band The Dillards and add hippie musician/songwriter/riverboad pilot John Hartford and you would think you'd have a surefire hit on your hand. At least that's what record executives at Flying Fish were thinking in the late seventies, early eighties when these two albums were first released. Unfortunately, GLITTER GRASS is only marginally listenable (3 stars), but PERMANENT WAVE is a real stinker (1 star). Both of these albums are the low points for all artists involved. Even repackaged as a two-fer, you're better off spending your money on anything else by Hartford or The Dillards. This one is for completists only."
5,Stylish Monticello,"These Moen towel bars are very stylish and even though the bar is a bit thinner than I thought with the thicker wall attachments, they are sturdy. I attached them to a wooden bathroom door and they went up with little trouble and are firmly fastened.The only irritation is that the bar rolls in its attachments. I solved that by slipping a small bit of gorilla glue between the bar and its holder - no more slippage and very nice towel holders as a result."
1,disfunctional bushnell elite 4200,"New Bushnell 4200 would not respond to azimuth adjustments.Scope has been returned to Bushnell.The clarity and brightnessof this product are excellant,however,I would expect a scopein this price range to be flawless."
4,mirada intimista previo a su bocanada musical,"Realmente genial. Este trabajo fue,sin duda, en su momento y aún ahora,de lo más constructivo que ha dado la música.Un disco intimo de principio a fin en todas sus expreciones posibles.Nos enseñó a todos los músicos argentinos una lección ."
2,be Careful When You Buy This,"I bought the 2 CD package, W/Extra Songs. Well Folks.... CD # 2 has 16 songs that have Nothing to do with Simply Red, Oldies but still Goodies. Just remember, there is False Advertizing going on here, Be Careful, It's not worth the price you pay."
3,was expecting more brightness....,"The product was less bright than I expected, since I like a very bright living room. So, it was packed away for a while before our bathroom bulb stopped working and that's when we could put it to a desirable use. The amount of light is just fine for such a use, but it does take a while to reach its maximum brightness."
3,Great Customer Service,"I bought the kidcraft table and chairs and it's a lovely set but I received a defective one. BabyAge called today and will take care of the return, etc. I also bought the 50's style fridge and stove and I love that. I appreciate great customer service. Thank you."
1,Cute but not quality.,We had this for about a year when all of the chairs started to fall apart. I've had to tighten the hardware on the table several times.
5,Great Set!,"This table and chair set is just what we were looking for -for our little girl's play room. It is made of great quality wood and was very easy to assemble. The pastel colors are very classy looking and much more affordable than alot of other high-end store sets. We are more than satisfied with the product so far. We, as adults, even sit on the chairs with no issues to have a tea party with our daughter! Love it!"
2,Needed To Be Better Proofed,"I enjoy the writings of E. Lynn Harris, but unfortunately after getting through a little over half of his story I just could not take anymore. There were countless typos that were far too distracting to enjoy it."
5,Outstanding Novel,I really loved this book. All the authors did an wonderful job. Eric's story was a little weak but it was still good. E. Lynn always does a wonderful job on any of his writings. This was really good for him and I hope he gives us more of Kenoy and Jimmy. Marcus's story was just superb. I was crying at the end and wanting more. I couldn't wait to read Good People and was glad that he had Amir and Kenya in there. Then to Colin's story. It took a while for me to get it but I did finally get his message and was overjoyed with his writing. I think he is a great author and his writing are the usually thing. He flows with his own idea and way and that is someti=hing you don't find very often with todays writers. Keep up the good work Colin.
4,Got to be Real,"If you are the type of reader who likes a book you simply can not put down you need to read Got to Be Real. This book is brutally honest about life. While all of the stories are different they can all relate to you in some way. All of the writers did an excellent job making the stories real, exciting, and funny. Marcus Major's story about Kenya and Amir was my absolute favorite. Almost everyone woman has run across an Amir type, and if you haven't then he's coming! Overall, this was a great book. Now I'm looking forward to reading Good Peoples by Major."
1,If You Have a Lot of Time on Your Hands,"By all means read this book if you have nothing better to do. This book had 4 short stories but it took me 4 long weeks to read it. It was by far the worse book by all of these wonderful writers. Individually they are outstanding authors but they really should stay away from the ""short story"" colaborations and stick to doing their ""own thing"". This book makes for good bedtime reading. It will put you to sleep quicker than Nyquil."
3,Not my cup of tea!!!!!,I only liked the first two stories of this book the last two were a big dissapointment. I do not want to read about two gay me getting it on and I was very dissapointed with the ending of the last story he should have ended up with patience instead of his ex-wife I do not even see the reason for even bringing her in the story. This book was a big dissapointment; I would not recommend this to anyone!!
4,Got to be Good!,"This collection of four short stories does not disappoint. Written by four of the leading African Ameican novelists of the past few years, it offers many intriguing perspectives on love and romance in the modern world.Especially as a fan of Eric Jerome Dickey and E. Lynn Harris (and thereby more familar with their work), I was curious as to how they would make the transition from novel form to the novella, or short story form. In both cases, they were able to pull off the character and story development very well.As for the other two contributors to this anthology (Colin Channer and Marcus Major), they have found a new fan! In particular, Mr. Major's novella left me wanting more.Here's to a job well done. In the future, I hope that many other best selling authors follows suit and treats their readers to such a sampling of their work."
1,I'm still waitting for the cd ...................,"I haven't rececived the cd yet. I sent a message to the seller, and I haven't got response either !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
2,BORING BORING BORING,"Fluffy and blonde Garth has a LONG warm-up, and a LONG and painfully boring low-impact aerobic session. The only good thing about this tape is that she is totally against eating disorders and lets you know that Hollywood stars do not starve themselves to stay in shape."
5,Entertaining Adventure,"So often we hear that someone is ""confined"" to a wheelchair. Hockenberry shatters that image as he shows that the adventure of life continues whether a person walks, runs, or rolls. He takes the reader to some memorable places of the late 20th century."
5,Hockenberry tells wheelchair life as it reallyexists.,"After 25 years of working with disabled students, I myself suddenly fought to stay alive and then spent nine months in rehabilitation. As a person who graduated from the same ""rehab boot camp"" as John Hockenberry, I identify with much of his book.After ffive years, I can walk, but am reading John's book very slowly. Life is great!"
4,Good introductory text,"This book is one of the best introductory texts to object-oriented programming available. It has the advantage of not depending on a particular programming language, so it is free to deal with the object-oriented philosophy and explain the core concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, etc. The examples used are simple but elegant, and the flow of the book takes the reader from the basics of building objects to the complexities of object interaction. It assumes very little about the readers background, so it is thorough and easy to follow. This book's best use is for the person who wants to make the jump from procedural to object-oriented programming by understanding it first, and getting into the details of coding later, which is the way it should be done. When someone asks ""What is object-oriented programming, anyway?"", I point them to this book as the answer."
2,Not good.,"I purchased this book thinking that this is small and simple book which clearly explains object oriented concepts. But I am very disapponted after reading few chapters. The book starts nicely and the first couple of chapters are really good and after that author repeated many concepts over and over again without any extra information. The last few chapters were useless and out of scope of this book. Why someone needs to read this book for difinition of HTML,XML, RDBMS and EJB etc ? Author should have concentrated on just OO concepts as title says. This book may be good for someone who is absoultely new to software development or recent graduate who is preparing for an interview."
5,Exactly what I wanted - Dogs love it!,"The leash has worked wonderfully. My two dogs love it - although one of them took four trips before he began to enjoy it. It is next to impossible for the dog to cause me to lose my balance. The product was shipped quickly. It did not have any instructions, but you would have to be brain dead to not understand how it attaches. If that is the case - you shouldn't be using it anyway."
3,Please help!!,"I am sure this is a great product, its gotten a lot of really good reviews, but I haven't been able to install it and feel like its just useless to me and Ive wasted my money. There is absolutely no installation instructions whatsoever and I tried to figure it out myself but I just cant. Maybe it just doesnt fit my bike. I have a Giant Cypress Ladies Comfort Small bike, does anyone have any suggestions? Please comment on my review if you do. Thanks!"
3,ok for the money,"when attaching the bracket onto the rear of the bike , due to its thickness, there are few threads left on the bolt after the installing it. I guess as long as its tight it""ll be ok. the velcro is slightly lame. I hope it holds."
4,Clear as a bell!,"Great scope, when zeroing in at 50 yards, had the last 3 holes touching.Clearing the focus, using the back focal ring, is needed if you change powers more the two fold.Solid mount, clear site picture, I'd give it a 9 out of 10 for the money."
2,Hand-written notation hard to read,"I'm not commenting on the content, but this is hand-written musical notation that looks like it has been through a few generations or recopying. It looks sloppy, and when you are taxing your brain trying to learn exercises, you shouldn't have to worry about reading muddy and blurry print the publisher was too lazy to spend a couple hundred bucks to transcribe into sharp, readable text. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the quarter rests from the quarter notes, such as on the bottom right of page 5."
3,"good book, long wait","The book is in very good condition, but the wait was very long. It got here on time, but it was very close to the deadline date of delivery."
2,S'Wonderful: 4 Giants Of Swing,"I would have given it five stars if Joe Venuti hadn't ruined everything with that screeching fiddle. The title should be, ""Three Giants and One Hacker."""
3,music teacher,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. As a musician, and music teacher, I was hoping to glean some tips from this book. I found it to be dated (all the music examples are Mancini's which I acknowledge as great material, but musical styles have changed), and there really aren't too many pointers, suggestions, or mention of standard arranging practices. There are some, but this is not (in my opinion) a good book for a text book. The CD has musical selections with matching scores, but there is no text as to why certain things were done, or how certain instruments sound together or isolated versus hearing an instrument in a full score. I guess I bought this book more out of nostalgia and sentimentality!"
4,Fun Stories for the Scooby fan!,These are cute stories of the Mystery Inc. crowd. My Scooby lover could listen to one every night! They are a little long when read out loud. Colorful cartoon pictures too!
5,Nice book,I had this book once before but it was stolen. I really like the stories in it. The pictures in the book are interesting.I think that this is a good book to keep.
3,Good curler...bad straightner,"I have used Revlon's curling irons for years and always loved them, but I have recently started straightening my hair and when I found this one that combined the two in one I was very excited. Not for long though. I have lots of hair but the strands are medium fine. When I tried to use the straightener my hair just fell right through the clamp because it didn't clamp down all the way. I had to use extremely large sections of hair and squeeze REALLY hard to get the hair to stay in, then I had to go slowly to let the heat get all the way through and it still fell out at the ends because of my layers. The result...very sore fingers, crimps in my hair where I went a little too slow and frizzed ends. I ended up curling my hair that day, putting the iron back in the package and taking it right back to the store. This iron might work on thick or course hair strands, but if your hair strands are fine, look elsewhere."
1,Terrible!,"As soon as I turned it on, the straightener didn't work. It took a long time to heat up an the curler was rough and didn't work for my hair. I will never use this again."
1,They must be selling Sno-Cones in Hell,It's scary to think that we live in a world where an album like this was recorded and released. It's more terrifying and mind boggling that some people spent cold hard cash from their very own pockets to purchase this album.
2,Sacred Parenting Participant's Guide: How Raising Children Shapes Our Souls (New),"I was disappointed with the product, as I thought that I was ordering the Sacred Parenting book. The participant's guide is no help to me at all."
2,Painful to Use,"I've been using this pulverizer for a year or so now. It is really bad. I mean it gets the job done, but at what cost?If you don't have hands of steel, don't purchase this item. In order to crush zinc pills or even Flintstones Kids Vitamins, I can only put in 1/2 to 1 pill at a time, and then I have to repeatedly torque the top harder and harder, releasing in-between to allow the crushed pill to move, otherwise it cakes together all hard again. It hurts my hands just to crush one pill. THEN I have to crush 5 or so more.I'm getting something with a much better mechanical advantage."
3,Pill Pulverizer,The picture for this product is misleading. It is difficult trying to crush large pills. The lid locks crooked very easily making it difficult to open. It is also uncomfortable to hold while turning because there is no cushioning on the handles. This is not the product for people with large hands.
5,Awesome Scope,I have this mounted on my Remington 700 .308. I'm hitting 250 - 300 Yards with no problems and this scope is seeing the targets clear as day.
4,"Blassie, King of Men","Freddie Blassie tells it like it is, in his own inimitable style. He led a fascinating life and he tells all about it, both the good and the bad. He pulls no punches, whether he is talking about people he liked (Vince McMahon, Nikolai Volkoff, Bobo Brazil), or people he hated (Buddy Rogers, Mil Mascaras, Ivan Putski). The book also includes sidebars written by people who knew Blassie, giving their own accounts of events in Blassie's life. This book is wonderful account of the life of one of the squared circle's all time greats. I said it before and I'll say it again, his name was Blassie, King of Men."
4,allen/lande melodic rock,"A rocking album with melody. The formula may get old by the end of the album, but overall it works."
3,Not as good as some of her other books,"Basically my main complaint with this book was that it wasn't long enough. I thought the characters were really interesting, but I wanted to learn more about them. The book could have been much longer."
1,Teenage Angst,"I think I'm too old to read anything Francesca Lia Block writes. Having said that, I'm sure I'm too old.Block's writing appeals to the most base sense of suffering, and therefore I can see why it appeals to teenagers. Since my taste in literature has expanded beyond a diet of angst, feeling misunderstood, and that there is nobility in suffering, it was a chore to make it through this book. Teenagers will love it for the mere fact that it's somehow validates their own overblown sense of angst.I'm sure there is a message within the pages of this book, a triump of the human spirit, but I was left with the impression that the main character would rather continue to suffer valiantly than take the high road.I also worry when reviews contain the words ""magical"" and ""poetic."""
1,Not good for an AR,The recoil from my AR 15 destroyed the inner workings of this scope after 30 rounds. I later got a tasco super snipe and still using it 2000 rounds later
4,Nice handles,"The color and design is pleasing. Installation was simple. With Amazon's 12.5% off deal in tools and hardware and free super-saver shipping, I don't think the price can be beat. At any rate, it saved me yet another trip out to Lowe's!"
5,Crazy Dorene............,"Great read. Loved every second of it. Read it the first time as a manuscript on an flight from Anchorage to Seattle and shared pages with the guy sitting next to me. We laughed, we cried, we got to Seattle...and wished the flight had been delayed so we could finish the book.A must read for anyone who has lived in Alaska. The mixture of real Alaskans with fictional stories, and real stories with fictional people is masterful.For anyone who has visited Alaska, a great reminder of your stay in Alaska.For anyone planning a trip to Alaska, a primer on life in the Last Frontier.Just remember, only half the lies are true."
1,Where is the bomber?,"I expected to see enough B-17 footage and a lot of mission adventures, so I purchased the video, but it did not meet my expectations. I felt cheated.If you want history background from the origins of strategic bombing to the atomic bomb era, you may like it. Else, you will ask ""Where is the bomber?"". It does not have a title that best describes the contents.If you want to see B-17 footage, do not buy this one. Consider yourself warned."
1,How Do I Get My Money Back?,"If you ejoy watching video of jets & helicopters with a radio playing the equivalent of Coast to Coast in the background, then this is your DVD. And the Christmas theme? There is a simulated snow scene, but nothing else."
2,"Weak, odd early Sabatini","This book is much weaker, though less predictable, than Sabatini's preceding novel, _The Shame of Motley_. The plotting is tedious enough (much of it pointless) that I couldn't get through it. On the other hand, it's not in his usual mode with his usual stock characters and incidents."
4,About it,"Very good trombone, excellent for beginners...if you like to start playing the trombone, this is the best buy."
1,Terrible Oil,"I would never buy this product again. It is the worst quality olive oil--made from the last of the leftovers of the olive pressing process (that is what ""pomace"" means). I didn't know that before I bought it, otherwise I wouldn't have! I had to throw it away--it smelled and tasted rancid. If you order it, just be aware that it is not a quality olive oil."
5,brass light fixture,Very pleased with my brass outdoor light fixture.Item was exactly as described and shipped quickly also.Would gladly do business with this seller again. Thank you!!!
4,I am in this movie,"I am in this movieI play ---- "" Onibaba ""If you like cheesy B movies ..... then this is a good one to make fun of when you watch it"
3,You say it's not a RomCom like that's a bad thing,"The acting is good, the writing and editing less so. Direction is workmanlike at best; it's pretty easy to question a lot of the choices made here. The acting is solid though, and I managed to care about the characters a little. So it's watchable, especially since it happily is NOT a romantic comedy, with all that attendant predictability. 3 stars is probably generous, but I had to round one way or the other, and I'm in a giving mood. I may check out the original film -- the situations portrayed in a more believable manner might actually make for a GOOD film. Which this one isn't, not quite."
3,"If you're expecting another ""Garden State"", stay away","""The Last Kiss"" is actually one of the movies that I had anticipated seeing the most (being such a huge fan of ""Garden State"") and was also disappointed by the most. Zach Braff is almost the same character in this movie. Going through some life crisis where he has to figure things out. Except in this movie, it's not nearly as brilliant or sympathetic. When I used to watch ""The O.C."", Rachel Bilson was my favorite female character (one because she was hot, two because she was cute) but I found her character in this movie to be QUITE annoying despite what she looks like. The movie portrayed guys as weak and lacking of any type of emotions when it comes to love and commitment. The ending was a disappointment because sometimes happy endings aren't deserved."
1,Awful,"This movie is terrible. Its not the idea that's so bad, but the actors are horrible. They are so overwrought with emotion, its almost painful to watch. I'm not even sure why I'm finishing the movie. That OC girl does a great job of playing the immature college student, though. I find it hard to buy her character, I don't know any girls who behave like that, but hey, I've been out of college for a few years, maybe things have changed. Spare yourself, this is 103 minutes of my life I'll never get back! Thank goodness I only rented it!"
4,Zach Braff is GREAT,I really enjoyed this movie. The soundtrack is awesome too. The only thing I didn't like in it is Rachel Bilson's annoyingly immature home-wrecker character. Zach Braff is AWESOME.....
2,"Great documentary, WRONG DVD","While I've seen the documentary and love it to death, the DVD that I ordered was a single DVD of the feature film with no extras. What I received was the packaging for the single disc version, but inside was just THE BONUS DISC. I can't imagine how many copies of this are being shipped out that have only Disc 2, but I'm guessing quite a few."
3,Frost ~ Fine Art & Black Metal made this DVD worth it,"I didn't expect this video to have so much Varg in it. However, if you fast forward through his prison rantings you will get to the most fascinating footage of the musician/artist ""Frost"" and the interest of the fine art world in black metal. I like how the black metal, dark side, occult is now being represented and explored in the fine arts. I wish there was more on this. I think this would make the Norwegain artist Edvard Munch proud! I like how Munch's ""the Scream"" and the screaming corpse painted face of a black metalist is compared. There is no Gorgoroth on this DVD though the package promises this. That was pretty disappointing. There is a focus on the deceased members of Mayhem of course, and some of their first album, but not anything about Mayhem today. Do they still exist? Who are the members now without their forefathers? You will not find out in this DVD. This video mostly focuses on the past, and through the eyes of Gylve and Varg."
2,Terrrrrrrrible...,"Low budget & yes the entire document basically revolves around 2 individuals. Period. If you're looking for something that focuses on the music this ain't it. If you're looking for disjointed views about Norwegians needing a ""pure bloodline"" & music being secondary then this lump of crap is for you."
4,Still Hopping along !,Frogger for the atari 2600 is a gem of a port of an arcade classic.ok so it dosent have all the bells and whistles like video games do now..but when this port came out originally..all that mattered is the gameplay...and even in 2011 its still one excellent port.....the 2600 version ranks up there with the sega genesis version for the fun factor..sure the genesis version looked better...but the 2600 version is classic all the way...i still remember the commercials for this one and wanting this game for christmas which i did get along with q bert..remember that seinfeld episode where george bought the frogger arcade game? classic! and youll see what frogger is all about when you plug a copy into your atari...hop to it! its not that hard to find and its worth checking out.fun fact many people didnt realize that frogger was actually produced by sega (read the label its stated there)
4,Good for those devoted Dalai Lama fans,"Great for Devoted Fans, but little new in the way of insight or teaching.Beginners may be disappointed - hence only 4 stars for the DVD of a 10 star Dalai Lama."
4,Only One Major Flaw,"This was a great DVD on the subject of the Chinese invasion, the holocaust of the Tibetans and the response of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. There is just one major flaw that could have been corrected but no one thought to research the matter.This Dalai Lama is believed to be the 14th incarnation of the prior Dalai Lama's who were and are all an embodiment of the celestial Bodhisattva Chenrezi, known as Avaloketsvara in India/Sanskrit and as Kuan Yin in China and Kannon in Japan.Yet, this Director repeats many times that he is believed to be a reincarnation of the Buddha. Absolutely not!There are many aspects to Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism and one is that all sentient beings have a true Buddha Nature... only to that extent can we say that anyone is an incarnation of the Buddha.Otherwise, this is informative and caring in its presentation.Thank you, Namaste and Shalom,Dr. Arlette Poland[...]"
4,A Lyric Poet,Austin Hummell's The Fugitive Kind is an example of what lyric poetry should be. The music of the book is beautiful and the imagery stark and imaginative. I would recommend this work to any serious poet or reader of serious poetry. An example of lyric poetry at its best.
4,Mennonite Foods & Folkways from ought Russia - Book,"Thank you for sending it so quickly. It was like new. I bought it for my brother, who had borrowed mine several years ago. I had gotten mine from my daughters for Christmas so I asked for it back, and when I saw this, especially at such a reasonable price, I thought - 'I'll just buy this for him'. So I'm sure he'll enjoy having his own when I mail it to him. Thank you. Luanna Voth"
5,A variety of dishes for a variety of tastes,"I received this cookbook and I was blown away by the variety of foods, from American, Italain, Mexican, etc. I have made a few of these dishes and they are absolutely delicious. The weight loss stories that are in the book are wonderful and very motivating. This is a great book for someone trying to lose weight or for a present. I highly recommend it."
5,Yummy! And,This cute book shouldve won the Caldecott! I dont know of any other illustrator who uses food for art! It makes me hungry just thinking about it!It also teaches children the alphabet and makes learning awesome! Why didn't this book win???
5,Winning for Thought,"We think that Food for Thought shoould have won the Caldecott award because of their creative illustrations. Also, it was very interesting how they acutally made all the food instead of painting it. We love the colors. They are so bright and happy and fun. We could look at this book all; day and any day and STILL not get bored. It is almost like an i-spy book, theres always something hidden to find another day. We personally think that this is the best!!!!!! Hopefully, next year, a creative book similar to that, will win the Caldecott award."
4,Visual Feast,"It isn't just that food is used exclusively for every illustration in this vibrant, colorful book. The striking thing, really, is that the food just oozes personality.The orange orange winks. The red pepper is goofy while the green pepper is sort of bilious. The sheep - made of cauliflower with darling little beanish eyes - are charming and sweet. A big orange yelling at a crowd of little kumquats truly frightens them.A visual treat with good variety of basic concepts."
4,Good Service,The book arrived as expected. It wasn't in as good of condition as I had hoped but it was ok. I liked all of the case studies and they way they were presented.
2,The Long Drive Nowhere,"When I read a book, I like to know more about the plot at the end than I did when first reading the jacket cover. I knew a whole bunch of people were going to meet at a hotel to ""discover just how small the world really is."" With a sappy cliche like that on the cover, I should have been forewarned. I believed in the book's potential. The weaving of story lines to get everyone to the hotel was skilled and interesting, even if every major adult character but one had an affair. However, once everyone arrived at the hotel and met, the book ended. Six people in a parking lot with four guns, and no resolution. Three ringing phones, and not one answered. This book couldn't take a sequel, but it sure deserved another chapter. All the skilled story weaving in the world can't make up for a poor premature ending."
3,A album not for everyone,"Personally for me, this was another poor release by REM. A band that has been around for awhile over a decade, loses material and a sense of direction after time and this is what has happened to REM. The whole CD has quite listenable tracks but nothing to write home about.This album is only for real die hard REM fans."
2,a painful low point,"This CD is fun for the super-addicted R.E.M. fan, but when I was in college I had an annual ""R.E.M.fest"" with a friend once a year, and the absolute worst part of the day was when we got to Dead Letter Office. It's kind of a low point. It's downright sloppy in some parts and just dull in other parts. Although I admit to being amused by ""King of the Road."""
1,a loose pack of r.e.m. jams & variously rejected songs,"""Dead Letter Office"" is a record of R.E.M. duds... or, just the ones that never made it onto an album. Either way, it shows the band in a most relaxed state, which is fairly illuminating for long-time R.E.M. fans."
1,Misled and Disappointed,"I bought this item for my Spring 2013 Theatre class. I was under the impression that it included the play script, as well as the study guide. It just gave a summary of the play and characters. I wish I could get my money back."
2,Outdated overview,"Although it is argued (and mentioned on the cover) that this overview is revised, it seems to me a lot of 'ancient data' has escaped the attention of the compiler. Several regional and/or chronological sections contain information based on research now considered outdated. In fact, not just 'now' but even back in the early nineties when this revised edition was published. It is a pity that because of that many regional developments remain untouched: Where is central Mexico in this book? How about the Valley of Oaxaca (is 15 pages for Classic Oaxaca sufficient on any standard)? Etc etc. Only to those those who still consider Mesoamerica to be 'Maya and their neighbors' this overview will prove satisfactory. All others interested in an introduction to Mesoamerica should instead consider Smith and Masson's edited volume or Susan Toby Evans' recent compilation."
1,Missing the key song of the whole CD!,"This CD is unbelievably missing the key song to the entire CD, one that was performed at the Festival di Sanremo. The song is listed correctly as:9. Questa Nostra Grande Storia d'Amore; but when played, it is an entirely different song! Questa Nostra Grande Storia d'Amore does not appear anywhere on this CD.MONEY BACK!!!!"
3,Ceramic blade durability,"I purchased a ceramic blade because it was said to hold a sharp edge longer than the traditional steel blade. That does appear to be the case. However, I recently dropped the clipper -- which survived just fine -- but the ceramic blade cracked. I am going to replace it with another one, and hope that I can become a less klutzy home groomer."
2,Sizes not accurate,My son is no where near the height or weights listed for the sizing and this just barley fit him. The seam on the back started opening after wearing for just a short time
3,Runs Small,"Cute and my son loves it, but it runs a little small. My son just moved into a size 5 and there is not much room in this costume that is supposed to fit up to a size 6. A little disappointing that he won't be able to play in it as long as I had planned."
1,Poor quality..,"Very poor quality. Made with a very low quality material and got torn the very first time my son wore this. Eligible for ""0"" star rating. Don't buy this product."
4,Cute suit. Does the job. Not constraining. Fun.,"My son liked this suit because he's 2 1/2 - 3 and wanted a costume that isn't restricting. This fits the bill. I was a little shocked because it is VERY lightweight. Almost making you say - what ""IS "" this....BUT, the cool thing was that he could put in on over full clothing on Halloween and be warm AND fully costumed. You could see his dark jeans underneath a little - but not much. I think it is the perfect outfit for a kid his age. He work the ""wings"" over it (not the inflatable ones, the plastic ones) and was really happy. Especially because he could ""feel"" the purple hood on top of his head."
4,Good value for rimfire scope.,"I bought this scope to mount on a Marlin 22 mag. Getting it set up only required a few minutes as the Marlin is pre-grooved for rings. I found that the adjustable zoom was a little tighter than I was expecting, I would prefer it to be a little easier to adjust. Otherwise, great scope for a rimfire and a good low price."
4,Pretty Good Scope,"Mounted on Marlin 795. Easy to mount, easy to sight-in. I mounted it with see-through rings so I could still use the fixed sights. Shot 200 rnds on 2 different occasions and it held zero just fine. As with other reviewers I noticed that the sight picture wasn't real clear above 7x. Overall, though, a good value. I'd buy it again."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this movie. I watched it with friends and family members and they all feel asleep. It had a confusing and bad ending with me.
4,"Great Recording, Great Band.","""Reckoning"" is a great album, like most other R.E.M. works. This is from their early years, so it's of the same kind of sound as ""Murmur"" and ""Chronic Town,"" and a little clearer than ""Fables of the Reconstruction"" that followed it.The songs are a nice mix--there's classics like ""So.Central Rain"" and ""(Don't go Back to) Rockville"", plus some lesser-known songs (at least in this day and age) like ""Time after Time (annelise)"" and ""Little America"", two of my favorites. If possible, get the I.R.S. Vintage Years 1984 version, recently released, with five extra tracks--""Windout (with friends)"", ""Pretty Persuasion (live in studio)"", ""White Tornado"", ""Tighten Up"", and a nice cover of ""Moon River.""A good album that every R.E.M. should have."
5,The Third Best R.E.M. album of all time,"Reckoning is a classic;Why? There are no bad songs on this album, and especially tracks 3, 4, 5 are unbeleivable. I have all 11 R.E.M. albums and this is how I would rank them from best to worst 1. Automatic for the People 2. Murmur 3. Reckoning 4. Document 5. Out of Time 6. New Adventures in Hi Fi 7. Life's Rich paegant 8. Up 9. Fables of the Reconstruction 10. Green 11. Monster"
5,Test of Time: Passed...,"I think a review of any record should be done many years after its initial release. Hold on...Let me finish. The record's worth, good or bad, should hinge on its ability to stand up over time. ""Reckoning"" truly has that ability. If I were to buy this record today, I think I would be as enthralled as I was many years ago (1986?)when my friend Dave Ritter gave me a copy of the ""Reckoning"" LP (WITH the ""left of Reckoning"" mysterioso after the last track!)on cassette. From ""Harbourcoat"", on through ""Little America"" (and, of course, the aforementioned oddity), this record is truly an auditory experience on par with The Beatles' ""Revolver"" and...you take your pick. A must-own for ANY MUSIC LOVER!"
4,A good book for Review,"I am taking French in college and I found this book an excellent source. All the verbs are in one place, properly categorized. I liked the examples too.A neat book, I would say. Will help you a lot if you are a beginner. Note that this is not a grammar book but a pure verb review."
5,One of the greatest French book,"I love everything about this book,the exercises are presented in a way that conjugation of verbs are interesting and not confusing.The more I enjoyed my learning of french.I have so many reference books,but this is the must have."
1,"Michael Alan Weiner First Started Hocking Books Containing ""Cures"" Such as Coffee Enemas, Now He's Found This New Scheme!","This silly, poorly illustrated book is just Weiner's latest attempt to make a fast buck.He goes by ""Savage"" rather than his legal name ""Weiner"" in order to escape the stigma he created peddling unscientific, unproven natural cure books containing such absurd remedies as vitamin C to cure H.I.V.This guy talks about religion incessantly, but won't even acknowledge his own Russin Jewish heritage. His legal name is ""Weiner"", but for the last few years has gone by ""Savage."" He even has his gap-toothed smile air brushed out of all of his press photos.The only thing genuine about Weiner, is how good he is at deception in order to make a fast buck."
2,Just O K,I expected Michael Savage to read on this CD himself. I have listened to his radio program and this CD version of the book missed a great deal without his inflections and style.
3,Not what I wanted,I returned this item because he was not what I wanted. I was expecting a big covered heavy duty skillet but it is a big pot that you might boil in or cook soup in etc. Just way too big for my use as other pans I have serve that purpose.
5,It just works,"Does what I hoped it would - gets alerts and turns on a little light when there is an alert or warning for your area. You can listen to the alert or read summary on the screen. You can determine which alerts sound the alarm and which just turn on the light - what else you can want from a weather radio? The set up took under 10 minutes. Perfect.Disclaimer - We just use it as a weather radio, not as an alarm clock or radio, so naturally I don't care about these functions and wouldn't know if there is a problem with them."
1,Worked fine - but then it died,"I bought this and set it up to warn me in the event of storms, flash flooding, tornados, etc. It worked really well for about a year. After that, it stopped. When it's plugged in, it gets no power. I can use it on batteries - but only for a short while (~8 hours) before it eats up on the power. I'm very disappointed."
3,Cooks too Fast. Lid a bit clunky,"I've had this crock pot just about a year. It's great for things like soup & Chili. I've not had as much luck with meats. It cooks much faster than any recipie. (Cooks as if it's on high versus low.) A recipie that calls for 8 hours miniumum on low is done in about 4 hours.The probe does not work consistently. Today I put a roast in and it read 212 immediately and went to simmer which supposedly happens when it reaches the temp. needed for meat. I used my own digital meat thermometer and it ready 45 when inserted.I also just broke the hinge on the lid. It's always been clunky. I am surprised it lasted me a year.Overall, I like the ability to set whatever time I want rather than 4 or 6 on high or 8 - 10 on low. That's the main reason I purchased it. I also like that you can combine cooking on low and high with one program. That's a nice feature for recipes that call for an hour on high and then turn down."
3,Warning - 3DFX required for Ultima IX,"While Ultima Online may work ok for most video cards, anyone with a TNT, Radeon, or Geforce is not going to be able to play Ultima IX. Running a 1 gig AMD Thunderbird with 256MB RAM I can't get decent frame rates even on the lowest 640x480x16 settings. (Note: The box says it'll run on a P266). When I had my old 3DFX Voodoo 2 it ran fine. Be sure to take this into consideration when purchasing this bundle. If you don't have a 3DFX card, just get Ultima Online Third Dawn and save your cash."
1,Bindi Body Art Kit,"I do not recomend this book to anyone. The Kumkum powder was not worth the cost of a picture book and some cheap bindis. I was very excited when I saw this box, and was not impressed with what was inside. It shows you how you can achive very nice designs, yet include VERY little to make these looks. A waste."
2,Good book- Bindis are disappointing,"As someone who is in the business of importing Indian clothing and jewelry, I was really excited to see a book about Bindis- but I could have done without the overpriced makeup kit. Beth Margrett's book has great tips from a professional makeup artist on how to apply Bindis and kum kum powder. I was totally enthused until I saw the tiny pack of Bindis I had to work with. You could use the kum kum makeup to make up for the fact that there are very few, relatively plain Bindis in this kit.How typically western to overpackage and overcharge for a beauty trend that comes from the East!Heather"
3,Imitative Style Fails To Impress,"This band undoubtably played an important role in the folk revival scene of the late 50s-early 60s. But, though I like most of the songs on here, the band's renditions failed to move me. This is partially because I would rather hear songs, such as the Carter Family's ""Keep On The Sunny Side"", by the original artists. I also admire folk musicians, such as Dave Von Ronk and Joan Baez, who provide a new take on traditional material. In contrast, the Ramblers seem to be trying to imitate the original artists as closely as possible. The result is a watered down version with nothing really creative happening. I do appreciate this band for helping to bring folk music to a wider audience. But I find their imitative style to be less than inspiring."
2,Disappointingly poor index,"I'm new to PHP and MySQL, but a programmer for over 3 decades. I'm customizing some PHP code, using code examples for ideas. When I (a) see something I want to understand better or (b) want to find the PHP analog for basic functions, I naturally turn to the index to try to find the information I need. However, I found the index very disappointing because of what it doesn't have. For example, simple and basic keywords are not in the index: ""comment"", ""logical operator"", ""and"", ""or"", etc. I'm going to have order a different book as a PHP reference."
4,MySQl-PHP textbook,"As usual in text books, there is a lot of useless information that is not necessary, but since writers are paid by the word, this is to be expected.I wish there was a section on MySQL commands."
3,Very good in principle but falls down on errata,"Like others I've found this text an absolute corker for getting started with on-line databases.However, after struggling with one of the examples for several hours I was disappointed to finally realise that the code was woefully short.Just in case, I thought, I'll check the book's web site for errata, and found several pages of it! Some of which contains errors, like wrong page number!!!!!I don't know about you but I find it hard to learn new stuff when the examples don't work.Well I finally got the code to work and I've submitted it to the publishers. But, whilst I'm quite an experienced developer, I've only been looking at PHP, MySQl & Java for a couple of weeks and presumably it takes longer to write a book.So how come the readers are fixing the authors code?Maybe I should write a book ...Was going to give 4* but because of the errors went down to 3."
1,What's all the hoopla??,"First off, I know punk, been a punker/into punk since '82. I know psychobilly too. The Cramps are neither. I don't know why everyone makes such a big deal of the Cramps. Bad Music for Bad People was one of the worst albums ever, this one is worse than that album by far. I think the Big Beat From Badsville album was the only one I could stomach. All slow and super uninteresting music unless you are on Heroin or something...even then, not sure I'd like the Cramps."
5,Excellent,Just to let you know this is a great dvd---it is well put together---for any fan of MK you should definetly own this---mostly the last 2 SKM albums-- songs are shown in black and white videos and concerts---some old school songs also---its about 2 hours long and it has high replay values--mostly this gives a glimpse of a gifted tortured--but honest and real songwriter who gives the viewer a look inside--definetly 5 stars!
2,Basic Book,"When I bought this book I thought that I will find sort of a methodology or approach to establish an Information Management Organization and guide me to deliver an Information Management Framework. This book did not meet my expectations. This book is very basic and discussing basic ideas about information management systems, ERP and difference among data, information and knoweldge."
3,"This is good, but not one of the greater UFC events.","For one, the audience spends most of the event booing which I thought was total BS. They got to see a guy get his forearm broken! How can you not love that?Seriously, one of the most brutal ending to a fight I have even seen in the UFC and I haven't seen another like it. Two fights on this card involve brutal knees and upset ending. Several fights go the distance and are a little boring. GSP is in his prime on this prelim card and does a very impressive performance. If you're a wrestler or jujitsu fan then you will most likely enjoy the Matt Serra and Matt Hughes fights. Not a great card, but a pretty good one. You gotta love Frank Mir and Tim Silvia's fight."
1,Can't get it running..,"I can't play the game.. I can watch the booting until the little ""play scene"" about the game where they build a house..The game are sutting down and a small window comes up and says"" DrawSprocket cannot switch to the rewuested resolution(800x600, 16 bit, 1 buffer(s)).Make sure your computer meets the display requirements specified in the read me file. ""and I have tried to change the resolution to 800x600 on my Mac and the other one they ask about.. but it does not help..so if someone know what I can do to get the game running, because I rely want to play this game :)-ZugarBombz"
1,HORRENDOUSLY SLOW and unplayable....,"... this has been a horrendous waste of money. After 2+ hours, I can't get the game to run on my computer, despite the fact that my machine far exceeds the system requirements. there's a 1-4 minute lag between when you click a button and when the action occurs, and in a game like this (there's a LOT of choices to make and clicks to make on objects) it's completely unplayable.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!"
1,"This is 1 pen, not a box of pens",I could not tell whether this was for 1 pen or a box. I took a chance. I even ordered 2. Now I am the proud owner of 2 pens for $8.27. Don't make the same mistake.p.s. This is my favorite type of pen so this review is really about the seller and misleading advertisement!
5,Ozzfest 2004,This is the best Ozzfest sampler i ever put my hands on !Every song on there is awesome !The only problem with the sampler is the main stage actsonly Black Sabbath. Would be nice if they addedJudas Priest Slayer Dimmur Borgir & Black Label Society.Get a copy of this if there's any left.
4,Not yet....,"I don't own this album yet, but it's on my wishlist, and let me tell you why. I've attended the Telluride Bluegrass Festival twice, 1986 and 2002. After going last year, I wondered why I waited so long to go back, and I have ordered my tickets for 2003. Telluride is a magical place, and they focus on TALENT. This album features songs by the late John Hartford as well as by Doc Watson who is a national treasure. There's only one song by New Grass Revival, though, and they have been the backbone of this festival over the years. Though they have disbanded, former members Bela Fleck, Sam Bush, and John Cowan can be counted on to attend and jam with almost everybody."
5,Beautiful,"This book is simply beautiful. It is a wonderful look into a portion of the west's history that is seldom seen...Basque sheep herding in northern Nevada. It is also a terrific family story as a father and son make the trek back to the ""old-country."" This fantastic book will make you laugh out-loud and bring you to tears at the same time."
2,Dave Matthews Band-Live at Folsom Field Boulder Colorado DVD,"I`m gonna keep it short,the music is great but it`s almost unbearable to watch.If this was filmed by a film student itwould had gotten a failing grade,though it does show every possible camera view of a concert ever recorded.Anywhere from overhead,to if you sat in the last possible seat in the place.Then the 3 boxes come up with a bad ""picture in picture""like view of the band,which is fine if you own a big screen t.v.,but useless to most everyone else(plus it`s cheesy !)Not to even start about the super rapid fire cutting from frame to frame,where your eyes get a workout trying to figure out what your watching.So now I don`t even watch it anymore as it gives me a major headache.Get the cd instead !"
5,Amazing sound and visuals,"Dave Matthews and his band really do it this time. Some people think he is a little too hippy, but in actuality, Dave and his sound is very Jazzy. I listen to this on my surround sound; on the big 55' 16x9 TV and I feel like I am right there (minus the crowds). If you like Dave Matthews Band even in the slightest...add this to your collection. There is one song, Angle, where his back-up singers take over a bit, and it is so incredible. That one song is worth buying this DVD for, but trust me, you wont be disappointed in the rest."
2,Video killed the music star,"Is this an experimental camera work video?? ...way too many different camera shots, zoom-ins, zoom-outs, etc. Rarely does a camera stay on a single shot for more than 3 seconds. I counted 229 different shot changes in one song alone. It's a shame because the music is great. I have no desire to watch this dvd again...unless my eyes are closed.... 5 stars for the music...no stars for the video."
5,A very funny book by the great rock legend.,"This work is truely a gem from John Lennon. This books contains everything that you want to have from John himself. In this book he offers the cynical satire of everyone and everything that are related to him. He attacks other Beatles, FBI, Richard Nixon, and everything that he can get a hand on.."
2,"LOADED IT, CHECKED OUT THE GRAPHICS...THEN UNLOADED IT","Yes I AM 50yo but I am playing my games on a 52"" TV/Monitor. EVEN SO, everything required waaaaaaaay too much management to get things done. Figures were tiny to say the least. My problem is that I bought CODENAME PANZERS 1 & 2 first; I think they did the VERY BEST with this genre. Everything else seems to have just been leading up to the gold standard set by those games. I'd avoid this game."
5,Excellent Video,"I just want to contradict another reviewer's comments that these performances are not up to par. I think they are wonderful. Many bluegrass musicians like myself are getting to see renditions of songs and tunes, and those of us that study the nuances of Scruggs-style picking are finding endless examples of how Earl really played them. It would be possible but very improbable for any group to have the same energy in a TV studio that they had live at Carnegie Hall. To me, it is even more enlightening to see them in a relaxed atmosphere. The quality from tune to tune is extraordinary and shows their consistency and professionalism. I will buy every one they ever produce."
2,i got this item and it had missing pages and messed up my whole class coz i really needed this book,i ordered this used book and i got it on time but it had missing pages so that no one coule read... think before u buy and don't mess with u'r studies..but the seller is very nice he helped me and returned my money back to me...
3,It takes Courage and a good editor,"You get a big morale booster after reading this book (and also a guilty conscience!). The stories are very inspirational, and you realize how much better this world would be if everybody felt like these ordinary heroes. However, the writing style is quite simple, and takes away from the substance. This book needed a good editor to polish the style and give it more of a shine."
2,Disappointing,"Having used the original years ago I was disappointed by the quality (lite plastic housing, hard to open battery bay and terrible hissing even at low levels). I wish I had checked the reviews more carefully before ordering."
3,"Casio FR-2650, the net is no place to replenish ink","We use this in the office of our non-profit organization. It works well, keys are straight forward. Only problem we have encountered so far is failed attempts to find out how to reink the rollers on the web!"
4,Toshiba Sattelite laptop keyboard,"This is the second keyboard I have purchased from these folks, have had little trouble with them.When you connect the ribbon connector to the laptop inside, you need to very carefully peel the back edge away from the keyboard itself about a 1/4 inch or so or it will not be long enough to connect and set into place to insert the 2 screws, it will pull the ribbon connector out again, I needed to do this with both of them but was easily overcome.I recommend this keyboard to anyone that needs to replace a Toshiba Sattelite laptop keyboard, works fine and is half the price that I have seen anywhere else and my users here at the hospital are happy with them, which makes me happy!Jim the hospital IT whipping boy.A+Network +MCP"
1,"Broken right out of the box, ribbon cable cracked. Said NEW in ad, was quite obviously a pull/used.","Ordered for a laptop what was purported to be a NEW IN BOX keyboard.It wasnt. It was a pull. Broken space bar, back panel and ribbon cable.... not worth sending back.This company makes replacement keyboards as well, and they gave me $5 credit towards a new keyboard. I ordered it and got it. it was new, HOWEVER the screen printed characters on the keys were very poorly aligned, some were almost 15 degrees off center... No big deal for the price (Caveat Emptor) My gripe was the screenprinting of the characters wore off on heavily used keys in a couple months...Keep in mind that theres a reason these are 10-15 bucks, and purchase accordingly. the only gripe i have is the poor quality of the screenprinting... The tactile feeback and responsiveness of the keyboard was perfect. And if you use a PC daily, who looks at the keyboard anyhow?"
1,WARNING,"I am a POLICE use of force instructor. I have been a Martial Artist for over 30 years and currently hold 3 Black Belts. Now, I own most of Peligro's books on the Gracie family and their art. In fact, all the books have been personally autographed by Peligro himself. I teach survival against armed individuals (Gun, Knife & Clubs etc), and I have to say that this is the worst of the series of books. Many of the techniques would get you killed if not seriously injured. The people who have rated this book before me saying the same stuff are telling the truth. In fact, I sold my book on ebay saying that the book was very bad, and some Gracie fan still bought it for the cover price. Do not buy this book, Royce knows his stuff in the ring. A place with rules & no weapons. His street techniques will get you killed. Don't buy this book."
3,Well...,"Would have been a lot more fun had the multiplayer component worked...that being why I purchased it. The error was that it could not connect to westwood online, although my internet connection was 100mbs, and currently connected. Having tried multiple times, I eventually gave up, mourning the loss of my wasted money. The game itself is aged but still fun."
2,Boring,"Boring and cut-scene crazy. Not much different than the original command n conquer. Come 'on, let's get original you guys!"
2,I Spy School Days,"There are at least a couple programming errors in this game. In a decoding exercise a picture of a coat hanger was shown, but it didn't follow through for the activity. When I clicked on the horse, I was able to continue the game. Obviously, it was an exercise in ""h"" words. I found another error, but I can't remember the specifics. These errors could be very frustrating for a child who was unable to realize that even computer games can have errors. But the game only cost a couple dollars plus shipping so I'm not terribly upset. There is plenty of good in the games, but a child should be warned about the errors."
2,You get what you pay for...,"We bought this game for under $10. It runs so slowly on our computer and often freezes while playing displaying some sort of error. It is probably made for an older version of Windows, but we have XP. I would not recommend this if you have Windows XP or above."
4,Not compatible with Windows XP,"Please use caution when purchasing this product. It is labeled Windows XP Compatible, but it is not. You have to reconfigure your entire system to get the software to work. Once you change your settings, then the software is great and my son loves it. I wish I could explain what you have to do to your computer to get School Days to work, but I had to consult with my brother who is a computer technician...I followed his instructions which were very complicated. He even had to search on google to find out how to fix the error message that kept popping up every time we tried to play it."
1,Not Windows XP Compatible,"I just tossed this one in the trash. It looked like a good game for my girls but unfortunately Scholastic doesn't believe in updating or supporting their products. I'd be very leary of buying any software from this company since software returns are difficult to negotiate. I would appreciate a list of truly Windows XP compatible children's software titles. Windows XP has been around for at least a couple of years now. I don't understand why compatibility is such a problem. Their support site cites that the problem is ""you have too much installed RAM."" Well, for most software, that is not a ""bad"" thing."
2,its a bore,"i am star wars fan.this book [...].it is very boring.if you are a star wars fan,you already know all the stuff in the book.it will collect dust in your room.david west donalds is weird to write this book.you will get no info from this book.do not waste your 15 dollars.buy somthing like the star wars triligy collection.it is very good.there are many star wars books out there.please do not waste your $$$$$$$$."
1,This book is the coolest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have read this book many a times and it gets better each time , if your children dont read this book you should tie there hair in a bun really really tight. This is the best book ever written . You should buy as many copies as you can . Tell evrey body about this book . It dosent even cost that much"
4,Seriously cool volume on Star Wars gadgets,"The beautifully illustrated DK duo cover characters, costumes, and weaponry in the Visual Dictionary, while the Cross Sections book dissects vehicles and spacecraft. Want to know how a light saber really works or what the interior of an Imperial Stormtrooper's helmet looks like? It's all in here. The most remarkable thing about the books is the amount of thought that's been expelled on the workings of things that don't even exist. The DK books are seriously cool and exceedingly browsable. Though aimed at kids, don't be surprised to see plenty of adults flipping through them also.-Michael Rogers, ""Library Journal"""
4,A great book,"Is really a great book for fans who want to know ore about the star wars universe. The only down is that is very short, there's a lot more that can be shown, but anyway the information provided is worth!!!"
4,You May Fire When Ready...,"The Visual Directory complements the Pictorial Directory and really gets into the characters of this famous trilogy.My only bickbat is the lack of information on Peter Cushing's villianous charcter, Grand Moff Willif Tarken. He was the main central player in the orginal Star Wars but because of his demise in this movie he dosen't get the full coverage he deserves."
5,Awesome.,"Wow,this is high quality stuff! The story line and gags are great. This is as good as pixar.Keep it the good work!!"
2,Could Be Much Better,"This CD ROM is not worth paying more than $5 for, unless you are really bored.Basically this program provides an introduction to multilevel marketing, starting a small business, an intro to the stock market and some other less than memorable stuff.One part that was OK though, was the GOALS section. In this section, you would type up your personal and financial goals and hear a talk by Brian Tracy.The calculators included on the CDRom can be found on the internet for free.In short, you don't need to take up the space on your PC to have this software. What I would do is sign up for Brian Tracy's emails and read the emails for free. GOALS! by Brian Tracy is a FAR better investment of your time and money."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!,I LOVED this movie!! If you have kids - watch it with them. If you don't have kids - watch it anyway. It's GREAT!!! I loved the dog!
5,"Well-done, uplifting film","Excellent film. Enjoyed it. Shared it with my grandkids, and paramedic/fireman son. A good choice. Recommend it to others. Do it."
5,awesome movie,this movie was awesome. I loved everything about this movie. My nephew is three and loves firetrucks so for a gift for him i remimbered this movie and bought it. He cant get enough of the movie and neither can i. He calls me whenever he watches it. I can watch this movie over and over. AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!
3,Firehouse Dog,"Great family movie. Adults enjoy as much as children. If you love animals, you'll love this story. Love seeing all the real firehouse dogs in the credits."
3,Firehouse Dog DVD,"The service was quick and reliable. The only thing was that the actual DVD came loose from the piece that holds it in place which allowed it to slide around inside the cover during shipment. Thus the DVD is scratched, but seems to work alright for now."
2,decent hopper,"i have this gun 4 my 2 genesis 2's(im getting a new gun)and this does alright 4 them since there not really fast, but if u have an electro hopper or an aotococker, get a halo b hopper so the balls load into the gun fast enough, with my guns right now i get the triggermoving so fast i end up chopping a ball or jamming my gun."
5,Must reading in telecommunications policy,"A fascinating account of telephone competition in the early 1900s, when the competing telephone systems did not connect. Mueller's analysis of the experience of a fragmented telecommunications infrastructure--and the decision to put an end to it in the name of ""universal service""--has important implications for Internet and telecom development today.John Crook"
4,"Good, affordable fixed power scope","I was looking for a fixed-power low-magnifaction scope for a Rossi .223 break-open rifle (part of a matched pair, .223 barrel and 20ga barrel). Thought about mounting one of my 3-9x40 scopes, but given what the rifle would be used for (teaching my son to shoot a rifle with iron and maginified sights, plinking) the 4X scope really was a better option. I have a small number of Bushnell scopes that I've been quite happy with (Trophy series mostly). Eye relief is good, image is sharp, basic reticle (I prefer mil-dot, but what do you want for $30?). Stays zero'd when adjusting for range. Can't complain."
5,Eric Coates London Suite,"In my youth the local theater had music I always thought of as ""music to go down the aisle by"", and later discovered who and what it was. This is a good recording which I'm happy to have bought."
2,This is a much better book and their is alot of of overlap...,Between the two. Save time and money and buy How to Start and Run an eBay Consignment Businessby Skip McGrath
4,"Beautiful crib, and easy to assemble!","The color of this crib is gorgeous-- it really is ""golden honey."" It was quite easy to assemble. I chose this one for the ease of moving the side up and down. It WON'T seem easy unless you push UP as you push the levers. I really fought it until my mom figured out you go in, then up, and then the side slides down with ease."
4,Solid for my 22lr,"So i got this from walmart but the same scope a couple days ago. Took it to the ""100yd"" range today, and it seemed to be pretty decent. i got it zeroed with solid bullets, then switched to the hollowpoints and they were dropping about 4"" further than the solids. I was able to re-adjust wwith the elevation clicker and got it close again with the other ammo.Solids : remmingtion thunderbolts and Federal liberty something or otherHP: federal American eagle bulk pack. (so theese might just be lower velocity too?)anyways, when i turn the knob, i cant tell much of a difference between 3x and 9x. i think i might have to put the lock screw back in, to be able to adjust the zoom? (opposite of normal scopes right?) and the directions say nothing about this.But i can atleast see the target at the end of the range, and seem to be able to get it sighted as close as i can shoot in a slight breeze anyways."
5,Life Changing and Transforming,"This CD is not only awesome but a life changing worship experience with God. The songs touch your Heart, Mind, and Soul. Each songs will touch you right where you are. If you don't have this CD you are missing out on a worship experience that will change your life..."
4,works like a charm,"I was a bit worried about buying a refurbished item but this one has been wonderful. We were smart to get one with room for 4 pieces of toast. I hate waiting in the morning. (well any time too)...I like the nice white cover since it is easy to see where it needs some attention. The toast comes out evenly browned and if you like dark and the other person likes light, both sides have temp controls so no problem to toast both at once."
4,Giallo film finally gets a proper release!,"""Knife of Ice"" (aka Il coltello di ghiaccio)is a very good rare Italian giallo film from great director, Umberto Lenzi. Lenzi has done several great gialli films, including: Eyeball(his best giallo), Spasmo, Orgasmo, Seven Blood-Stained Orchids, So Sweet So Perverse, Oasis of Fear, and other horror/thriller greats. ""Knife of Ice"" also stars Carroll Baker, an actress he's worked with a few times in his giallo films. Not heavy on the gore at all, but a stylish and classic mystery thriller!!!!!! Lets hope more Lenzi gialli films get a proper dvd release!!!"
3,Did Not Fit,I Ordered The Idem Because I Thought It Would Fit One Of My Pet Clippers But They Didn't So I Had To Send Them Back.
2,Lacks belt clip,"Effective case but lack of belt clip limits it to pocket or purse use. I also bought a cover with belt clip and use it exclusively with in pocket or on belt/pants. I like the option with very little additional size. This does however have a very nice non-skid material so would suit anyone not wanting option of belt clip. Belt clip model I bought is one that comes with arm band, but it works fine on a belt or on pants."
2,Cannot recommend Mystery Ranch,"I did not finish this book . After reading half way I found it dull and I did not care what was going to happen to the characters. so I think the author failed to "" grab"" me."
1,Unable to read farther than 4 chapters,"I did not care for the attempt to give a western backwoods way of speaking . I have tried to read it twice and it is so irrating I have to put it down. As far as the story line, it was pointing to a good read but I could not take the convaluted language."
1,this is ok (warning),if you love gym battles and pokemon then this is ok i guess its good because lance from the elite 4 shows up and solrock was awesome but if you love contests with may and drew this is a waste of money you might as well buy a dvd like pokmeon advanced vol 7 with episodes like now thats flower power.. but if you love gym battles thats ok but the other episode wheres armaldo will put u 2 sleep no affence but im one of the people who love contsets and may x drew episodes... but only buy it if you love gym battles..spoiler:swellow somehow amazingly absorbs a thunder attack. the 1show reason its that good. 2the real reason ash has 2 win every gym battle.
3,disappointment,"The condition of this item is excellent. However, I am very disappointed with this product. I watched the first DVD and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The next two DVDs were nothing more than rehashes of the first one, with some early footage of the exact same skits thrown in. I have not seen the last two DVDs; but as far as I am concerned, this product is a rip-off for the buying public."
1,good thing it's cheap,"What garbage. I like Borge and there are a few laughs to be had but there is only enough material for one disc, not 6. Things are repeated from disc to disc in different order and with an occasional omission or addition.So, since it's cheap you don't lose much but if you buy pick any one disc and watch it. That covers it all. Otherwise you'll waste a lot of time looking for a fresh morsel.Mine has gone to Goodwill."
2,Packers Parking Sign,The sign I ordered does not look like the sign I received. The sign is also a weak plastic. This will be a Christmas gift and I hope the recipient likes it.
2,Cheap looking,I am pretty happy with this purchase as it was not very expensive. It feels as though it is made of cardboard though instead of a more plastic-like material that would likely hold up in the cold wisconsin weather I want to use it outdoors in. They're being given as a gift so it hasn't been outdoors yet to review how it held up but I have doubts that it will
3,Solo para fanas incondicioales,"Este disco esta hecho solo para los fans incondicionales de Aunte y de Silvio. No es una buena opcion si se piensa escuchar por primera ves las cancines, pues no son su mejor versión. Pero a pesar de eso la magia de estos dos genios tocando juntos es unica."
5,X-files at it's very best!,"The Sixth Season of the X-files was one of the most thought-provoking of any of the seasons. The episodes were all genious and entertaining, while feeding you just the right amount of information that you need to know in each episode, so you will be drooling for the next. ""Field Trip"" was my favorite episode, because it was completely unpredictible until the very end. ""Triangle"" of course was a complete pleasure to watch, a very creative episode. All I can tell you is you can't go wrong with the 6th Season. X-files at the pinnacle of it's 9 seasons."
5,"Six, one of the best!","Season six was one of my favorite seasons of the x-files. I think the cute story lines helped many fans cope with the show moving from Vancouver. My favorite season is season seven, but six is next on my list! I am looking forward to this set more than any of the others so far. The other boxed sets are extremely well done, I'm sure this one will not fall short of my expectations. How many days till November 5th?"
5,Great security for your door!,"Very sturdy and is a breeze to use. Gave it to my Mom for added security on her rear entrance door. She loves it and feels much safer now. Great price also, was the lowest cost I found online or locally. I'm getting another one today for my home!"
4,DOES THE JOB,"The only change we did with this was the be sure we placed the bottom on a non slip surface. If you place it on a woodfloor it can leave a mark or slide. We used a non slip piece of rubber or a rubber backed throw rug under it and it didn't move when we tried from the outside to slide it. Good buy for free shipping and the price! Pretty heavy metal construction too, not plastic. The small holes in the side allow for an easy adjustment in size. Worth the $."
3,A Basic TV,Compact TV; sound quality good; video image blurry.A better purchase is the flat screen Sylvania 6420ff.
1,Stay Away,"This DVD player is the worst investment I've ever made. The picture quality is poor and I've had a plethora of other problems with it. The picture goes in and out, sometimes the player doesn't respond to the remote or built in controls, and sometimes it won't turn off without the plug being pulled from the wall. I no longer trust JVC when it comes to DVDs. There are DVD players that are more inexpensive than this, and they perfom better. Trust me, buy a Sony or Pioneer instead."
2,odd,"a woman from an abusive home marries an abusive arab and then marries and abusive protestant only to wonder 'where do I fit in'. Wait a sec. Why didn't she just marry a Jewish kid, unfortunatly the book tells the all to true story of people from abusive fmailies usually marrying into other abusive situations."
5,Ricky martin Video Collection,I had to get this DVD because I have the tape but now play DVD's more. This is a fantastic Video!
2,Never received it...,Two stars because I never received it. Sellers website said it was an in stock item. After two weeks of waiting I called and finally got to talk to a real person that said the item I ordered was not in stock. They did however refund my credit card. So now I am waiting for the same item from another company. I'm just glad it wasn't life saving equipment.
3,Easy to install with out a user guide,"It's hard to say much about a Amazon.com purchase of a 6ft HDMI cable. I can say what I want to about it, and hopefully it won't come back to haunt me, like the color of the HDMI or the way it was packaged. It was a pleasant shade of black, and with a connector on both ends, it was not packaged in the clear hard plastic that most items are packaged in. Once it was out of the package material It was an easy product to install, in spite of not having a supplied user guide. When I found that both connectors were just alike so it could not be hooked up backwards, it was so easy one of my grandson's could have installed it for me."
2,I need another book just to understand how to use this book!,"I am currently entering my 3rd year of nursing, and of course, the school that i attend also requires the use of this hateful book. I found it very difficult to use. The only recommendation I have is, contact your instructors early enough and hope they help you to understand this demon!"
1,Don't buy,"This is probably the saddest study on Alexander the Great I have ever read. Ashley wants us - seriously - to believe Nearchos' fleet battled with Neanderthal men. A misreading of Arrian by the author has convinced him that Aristobulus was the son of the Indian King Poros. There are major and minor mistakes on almost every page. At the price of 60 US dollars, you should really look for a better book.I'm sorry, but this is as it is."
4,trans cooler,Easy to install works perfect. You can feel the temperature difference between the in line and out line.
2,Nothing but trouble!,"This is a beautiful faucet. I was thrilled when I opened the package but that is where my excitement ended. We installed this and turned on the water to find the handheld leaked horribly. I called the customer service line and they were very helpful. I had a replacement within a few days. We installed the second handheld VERY carefully for fear the leak was caused by overtightening. However the new part leaked worse that the first. They happily sent us a second replacement that thankfully did not leak. Four months later the handheld is not working. We were able to use it about 3-4 times before the valve broke. It is not leaking, it just won't work, and I really can't seem to find the energy to deal with this horrible faucet again!"
5,"Funny guy, Funny Stuff","I was drawn to this because he promotes himself as a ""clean"" comdian, and he definitely qualifies as such. However, I was surprised at how much I truly enjoyed his show. His jokes and routine are great, but add to that his dramatic delivery and it is just very good entertainment. I agree with other reviews that his comedy is aimed at a more mature crowd, but there is enough laughter for everyone. I wish there was more of him available, but I have only found this one... so far!"
4,Pretty good,"First off, yes this is the guy from Back to the Future; which he tackles in the opening moments of the special.Now his brand of comedy won't be for the younger crowd because some of the jokes relate to being in your 40's and being a parent. There are also a lot of pop culture references that today's youth wouldn't understand.Now understand that I'm 28, so by no stretch of the imagination am I the target age demographic but I can appreciate the jokes none the less.With that said, it's not one of the best comedy specials I've seen but it does have it's moments that stick with you."
2,ok buy why the theme of disasters?,"the illustrations are nice. Not exactly realistic but clear and uncluttered, not an exagerated cartoonish style of so many children's books. the text and story line are creative. The rhyming and rhythem are fun. But why does everything always go wrong in these books? My son doesn't like them for this reason. All of the sheep books are theme he should like but he doesn't enjoy them at all because calamity after calamity and then the story ends. No fun times or successes. Problems, a few solutions and promlems. Nothing to attract him to the books. He does enoy stories where their is a problem or a challenge and then solutions. Anyway, I wish he like them because they are nicely illustrated and creative. Just too negative and a little scary. this review could be for any of the series, whether the jeep wrecks, the storm aboard ship and subsequent sinking of the ship (and why are they pirates?!), lost in the woods and rained on...etc!"
5,Gone But Not Fogotten,"Hot Rize--named after the secret ingredient in Martha White Flour--was one of the premier bluegrass bands of the Eighties. All four members were solid musicians: Pete Wernick on banjo, Tim O'Brien on lead vocals, mandolin and fiddle, Nick Forster on bass, and the late Charles Sawtelle on flat-top guitar. Half of the songs were written by Wernick or O'Brien, but my favorite is the gospel number ""The Man In the Middle."" Both Wernick and O'Brien continue to release the occasional solo album, but the sum of this band was greater than its parts. Traditional bluegrass at its finest. Also, if you enjoy oldtime country music, pick up the albums by their alter egos Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers. If your bluegrass library doesn't include anything by Hot Rize, there's a big hole in your collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,Bag Organizer may work for you,"This one is either too big or too small for my purses, but if you have the right purse, this should work well. The BIG downside is you will pay the same for the shipping as you did the organizer! Not worth double the cost to me."
4,NO SUBTITLES!!!,"A perfect movie, at last this team is taking seriously this new incarnation of Batman, but still not at the darkest level of Mask of the Phantasm. I have a complain: it doesn't have any subtitles!!!"
4,Batman Versus Dracula Review,"The Batman versus the original man bat. Bloody fun but it is very bloody at times. My daughter is eleven years old and I wasn't sure about letting her watch this, but she liked it a lot (no nightmares either) I especially enjoyed the Joker and how he plays in the movie. The confrontation between Batman and Dracula makes it obvious the Bat will have his work cut out for him. This is a good movie for anyone old enough to handle the violence and gore."
3,hard to rate prevention,"It's tough to rate something I bought to prevent a problem. I purchased this dehumidifier for my hearing aids to prevent trouble, not to solve a problem. As such, it's hard to say if it is working or not.I purchased this brand because it is the same brand as an ancient machine that I have to keep my welding rod dry, and that product has worked well for more years than I want to think about."
4,A classic remake of a good game,Final Fantasy 2 for the PSP is a Great buy and at the price you can't go wrong. classic RPG gamers and new ones alike will appreciate this game very much. This game is very challenging and you will have to strategize deeply to overcome a lot of the obstacles.
1,bad cable or poor design,"I haven't used this cable but one time and noticed right away that there was a connection issue. Honestly i think the plugs are a hair too small and is not making complete contact with the inside of the amp or the inside of my amp out on my guitar. I tried my old cable and my old cable works just fine. it is just a generic brand. I am really disappointed in the Monster brand because they are usually known for making quality products. Going to contact monster to see what they will do for me since the cable has a lifetime garantee. If the new cable they ship me works just fine, I will update my review. What a pain."
5,great product,great product. gold is the way to go when it comes to plugging in your axe. Monster sells a great product with a warranty
3,works but hard to hold still for accurate reading,The rangefinder has marking on the lens to line up for the yardage. It is a good idea but it is hard to line up when you are hand holding it. Use a club as a monopod to keep it still. On another note it is good for talking to concerts because it fits in your pocket unlike binoculars.
3,Glorified One-Eyed Binocular,"Not a bad 'toy' to have in the bag, but it's nothing you're going to reach for in a time of distress to help rescue you on the course.The clarity is great & the size is perfect, but the range on the scope is upside down & doesn't really help you at all.I'd rather the yardage (in meters & yards) just be left off of it so you can concentrate & see your target better.Overall, a nice little 'stocking stuffing' or thoughtful gift for someone (or yourself) if you got $20 to spare!"
1,Not Useful on the Golf Course,Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a gps or laser rangefinder. This product does not work well.
2,It's just a 5x magnifer,The Bushnell is simply a compact 5x magnifier for the golf course. It is not a rangefinder in any real sense.
2,range finder,product not as accurate as I expcted...takes time to locate target and then have to do a fair amount of estimating of the distance...for the money still better than totally gussesing the distance
5,CFO,"This is a great product. I would highly recommend it. I have used TValue for years. In finance, I used it to do deal structuring. As a CFO, I analyzed and prepared loans and leases. This ia also an excellent tool to do ROI and IRRs calculations. A much better tool than Excel as it is so flexible easy to use."
1,Arab Conspiracy,"I saw the movie when it first came out 20+ years ago and found it very interesting/entertaining. This DVD has THE worst quality image and sound I have ever seen in a DVD. Had I not seen this movie before, and thus known better, I would have thought I was looking at something worthy of being ridiculed in Mystery Science Theater 3000. Maybe the name of the distributing studio(Cheezy Flicks) should have been a warning sign. Don't buy this!!! I actually feel rating this at 1 star is too much but I didn't have the option to go lower."
3,"Interesting, and also a movie","Interesting enough, I'd say. An easy read, fairly entertaining. This book was made into a European movie which was only released in Euro-Video format (PAL) not in the US VHS format."
5,Mm....,"I really see no difference but my dog is growing up healthy either way so I have no issues with it.I feed her one everyday, she's growing up to be a nice big gsd."
1,Ripped up old library book,"Total rip-off! Do not order from this distributor. I was sent an old, torn up library book with library stickers still on the book. The covers were ripped to shreds and the pages stained. Bad buy!!!"
2,Samples don't work - no recourse,"Samples don't compile. There are a significant number of errors. I tried to contact MS Press but didn't receive a response. I then tried to contact the author using his ""Contact Me"" section on his web site. I also received no response (waited 3 weeks)."
2,sample codes does not work and not a good first reading,This book isn't for someone who does not know anything about c# and asp.net. Initial knowledge is required.Good:Goes over and mentions many events and methods and properties of new asp.net featuresBad:Hard to read. You are better off going to asp.net beta website and getting free tutorial before reading this book.Ugly:Many of the sample codes do not work.
2,hunk of junk!,"I am so disappointed in this item. I'm a big fan of The Kushies Zolo toys but this one is garbage. It looks and feels cheap. Also, the squishy water toy arrived deflated and there wasn't any liquid inside so I had to ship it back which is a pain in the butt! Considering the cost of this toy I expected so much more."
5,Rape of the Male. Tells it like it is.,Mr. Doyle doesn't mince words here. An excellent account of the unfair treatment of men in today's society. A great work and a classic book for the men's rights movement.
1,"the ""GOOD"" soldier?","I read this book expecting to find Zinni's honest optinions regarding the political and military heavy weights of today. I was also hoping to see his proposals for (1)solving the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and (2) avoiding the second Gulf war. Instead I found the book full of praise and platitudes for virtually everybody in the military and everyone who could be of benefit to him in the future. Perheps he was just being the ""good soldier"" and never openly berating a superior. Whatever, the book is boring and it seemed like every sentence went something like, Zinni then did ...... splendidly and his extremely talented underlings,........, did an outstanding job of helping him. What a bore. Zinni's interviews on the book threw me a quite a curve ball."
3,"Good, not great","A good scope but clarity at higher power is not as good as I expected. Still, for the money this scope serves me well. Also found it great for watching wildlife from our rear deck."
3,Not That Great,"My experience, so far, is that most clippers just aren't that good. These did not change my mind. Although, they will ultimately cut some dogs hair, they will not cut all dogs hair. For example, they'll cut my beagle-shepherd mix, but they won't cut the husky -shepherd mix. Of course, even on the beagle, it is taking a long, long time to get the job done and forget about getting a uniform cut. So, whatever. People rave about Oster clippers, but these are supposed to be a heavy duty, A5 type clipper and they are supposed to be able to effectively cut any dogs hair. So, like I said, dog clipper companies appear to be interested in chiseling their customers; not in producing a good product.Disgusted in Ohio"
2,Just not that good,"Don't expect too much from this book. The author does a good job of describing many of the features of Frontpage, but the coverage is not in depth. The step-by-step examples are a half-hearted attempt at implementing some of the features, but are incomplete and not well thought out.Overall the book is not bad for getting familiar with Frontpage but be prepared to go elsewhere for additional information to implement the features that were *just described* in the book.I gave the book 2 stars because of what I already wrote, but also because I expect much more from a book that has ""Professional Developer's Library"", ""Master advanced scripting..."", and ""Developer's Guide"" on the cover, should aim higher than XXX in 24hours title, this book does little better."
3,"Misrepresented ""excellent condition"" of used book.","Ordered several used books by the same author to give as gifts to new battery commander's wives. I requested only excellent condition books with no writing and no worn pages. Unfortunately, one of the books had a front page that had a personal written message on it making it impossible to now give as a gift. Very frustrated and now I don't have enough time to order and wait on another copy to be delivered before my presentation day."
4,A must have for any spouse.,As a new Army spouse I found this book to be quite a lifesaver! The Army Wife Handbook details the etiquette and protocol for almost any situation an Army spouse may encounter from Family support groups to planning a military wedding. I now teach tradition and protocol classes for soldiers and family members and this book is my favorite resource. I encourage any Army spouse-husband or wife- to read this book today!
4,Honeywell controller,Operates as described. Font and size of readout is difficult to read - recommend increasing font size to improve readability.
1,Boycott Honeywell the Anti-American Company,I will never buy Honeywell again. I bought this as a replacement for another Honeywell unit that quit working after only 5 years. I called customer service with a question about the Hc Hr connection as it was unclear in the instructions. The customer service goes to a phone bank in India to a worker who is getting paid slave wages of $200 a month. To top that off I look at the thermostat to find it was made in CHINA using more people at slave wages and who knows what dangerous metals are in this unit. I immediately returned the unit. I will not support companies who cost American workers their jobs!
4,fun and addictive,This is not your traditional anime. This was very fun and addictive. I kept wanting to watch the next episode and find out what happens next. Even though some parts are predictable it was very amusing. Glad to see this on Amazon Prime.
2,Avatar - the last airbender: The completed Book 3 Collection,Book 3 Vol 3 not working properly it freezes up. Was never opened prior to buying. will have to find Vol 3 of book 3 that works
4,Yep,"The technological advances of the Fire Nation had to come at a cost. We have seen this several times before - forcing people to work in mines so the FN can have their fuel, air pollution (black snow) and now we see the devastating results that a smelting plant has on a river. The river is rancid, the fish barely edible, yet people choose to continue living on it instead of just moving to the riverbank (look, I know how hard it can be to move from a home, but this is just ridiculous, especially when the people keep getting so sick) I kept asking myself, why didn't they just move upriver of the plant?Aang and Katara decide to help them, but as this was just a kids' show, it did not show the possible ramifications of their actions (the smelting plant was huge, and someone would have to investigate its destruction)"
5,Everyone Watches,Avater The Last Airbender is one of the best cartoons I have ever seen. It also brings my childreen togther to watch. I have two 18 year old boys and an eight year old daughter. I have never seen them sit and watch the same show and equally enjoy it. Even epiisodes they have seen.
4,Book of Fire,Both of my kids love Avatar the Last Airbender and will watch episodes over and over. We enjoy watching the series as a family. The children love to act out scenes and my daughter (4) will ask if I remember certain episodes and tell me what she liked about the episode.
5,Just Great,"I love it, definetly the best animated series containing a positive message for the young and not so young ones."
2,Cheap packaging breaks easily.,"This show is great and a must-have for fans. However, these complete book box sets are so freaking cheap. I've had to return the sets to Amazon multiple times because the packing would be damaged or the flimsy plastic DVD clips would break, causing the DVDs to float around in the packaging getting all scratched up. This has happened multiple times in a row. Do yourself a favor and buy the individual discs. They will hold up better."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!! IT IS MISSING DISK 2 AN COVER!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE BOOK 1,2,AND 3 BUT IT IS MISSING THINGS."
5,Super Fabulous Fun,"Wow! What a game! When I first played to game...I was hooked. And there is nothing better than a game that really reels you in from the absolute start. In fact-the game is such a hit at my house that when a large group of people play ""Mario Tennis"", we have to rotate in order to accomadate everyone. Why? Well because the game's easy controls and infectious gameplay is a real hook. The huge amount of character's is also a big plus. The inclusion of lesser known(but still loved)Mario characters; Daisy, Shy Guy, Boo, and Koopa; combined with more famous personalities, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Bowser...is just so cool. The game is great on one-player mode, but really wired when work the multi-player mode. The graphics are great and as said before the play control is superb. It is one of those games that will make you run out and buy a N64 just to play it."
4,didn't age that bad,aside from the graphcs this game didn't age bad at all. ive also never played this game and its very fun.
4,Good game.,"Mario Tennis is a good game. You get to play Tenis with the Mario characters. There are a lot to choose from, and the game is great to play at parties. While the game has it's good things, there are some bad things about it. The stadiums could have used a little work by making them more exciting, there could have been more levels to choose from on multi-player, the characters to choose from are never ok, they are either very good, or they stink.The game is a good game, but not without is's many faults."
5,I... LOVE... THIS... GAME! (And so will you!),"This game is the coolest thing I've played since I first got a Nintendo! Even my dad, who isn't into video games, liked it! it's a real classic game for the whole family to enjoy! It's perfectly acceptable for really young kids too! Don't miss the fun! Plus, using Amazon.com is a lot cheaper and it saves you a trip to the store! (even though this game is worth ten trips!)"
2,Boring after a week.,"After the greatly successful N64 game Mario Golf, Camalot Software decided to cook up a new sports title for the year. I had extremely high hopes for Mario Tennis, but in the end it was very disapointing. It's too bad really, because it had all the potential to be an amazing game, but fell flat on its face. It took me a little over five hours to complete in its entirety, so that will give you a clue to just how bad this game is."
4,Ace,"When Nintendo stopped making games for their Nintendo 64, many people seemed to balme it on the Playstation 2. Ironically there are many video games that were still worth the price. For the good games, like Mario Tennis, it does suit that field just fine. The game features 14 different characters to serve up your life, including Mario and his brother Luigi, Yoshi, Bowser and Peach, Princess Toadstool for those die hard Mario Brothers fans. The game also features amazing details of games including skilled ring games, and tournaments and hidden courses with zany Mario themes.Although many people still don't give sanction to cartridge games anymore, unless they are on Game Boy Advance, Mario Tennis is dull for a one-player game, but a smash for four."
2,a Trio that flies solo,"These phones are not linked to each other....if you change the ring on one, you have to do it on all three or you hear different rings. They also store their own Caller ID's, phonebooks, etc. which all has to be deleted/entered on each individual unit. I had read this in reviews before I purchased them adn thought I'd be fine, but it is really quite annoying. We also have had problems with answering calls--pushing the button to 'talk' will sometimes hang up the call altogether."
5,Outstanding introduction,"As someone who is getting into the e-conmerce world late in the game, I found this book a great introduction to the issues and problems businesses face in moving online. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs practical guidance entering the realm of e-commerce."
2,Disappointed too!,I picked this book up the day it came out and was very disappointed after I started reading it. I'd finish reading a few chapters and it would be days before I'd pick it up again and continue. I loved Ms.Martin's first book Body Check and liked her second book Fair Play but this one didn't really do it for me. Next time I'll just wait till it gets to the Library.
1,Wish I Could Rate the Jumbo Set,"I ordered this product, the Jumbo Cuisenaire Rods, and instead got the regular sized rods from Learning Resources. In other words, I paid a premium price for the jumbo-sized, which are supposed to have a base unit size of 2cmx2cmx2cm, and got short-changed."
2,not same as picture,"These combs actually appear on the screen larger than the actual size, so be careful that the smaller version is the one you actually want. There was also a 7 inch comb, which is the one I would have rather purchased, but by the time I received them, it was too late for me to exchange them."
1,Try Walgreens,Just bought a half dozen of these combs at Walgreens for 59 cents each.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
2,I Do Not Like This Pocket Comb~,"The price was too high for the Clipper-mate Pocket Comb 5"" All Fine Teeth. My husband combed his hair with this comb and thought it was an inferior product. It is too much trouble to return the comb, but I certainly would not buy it again."
4,Lots of great features,"I am buying one of these from a local audio store, and I am very impressed. The sub outs are great for aftermarket subs, or can be adapted to stock subs. I have a '94 Lincoln Towncar with 2 MTX 12""s in place of the stock 6"". The RCA sub outs with level adjustment are great for this.Another sweet feature is the faceplate. Everybody has removable faceplates, but what about tilt? For those with a stereo very low on the dash, the front of this player has multiple angles of adjustment so it is easier to see/reach the buttons. The faceplate literally pops out and tilts the top in so it is less than vertical. I haven't looked everywhere, but I have never seen another head unit that adjusts like this, which is why the shop I go to said it is their best seller.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
2,Exquisite music,"(Should be 5 stars -- can't seem to edit the stars.) I was first exposed to this recording in a high school Spanish class. I was blown away. Through some difficulty, I eventually came to own the LP. My comprehension of the lyrics has faded, but my appreciation for the music has not. Serious ear candy. It's amazing stuff to these very American ears. Some of it has a ""get under skin"" quality that is especially pleasing. I recommend this CD to everyone, even if you don't know a lick of Spanish."
1,Misleading title,"Lighter should be training pigeons, not children. Her slight book offers unrealistic, simplistic examples of interactions with children, has a self-important author's voice, and little compassion. She suggests making an adolescent coming home late spend the night in the garage, for example. If I were that adolescent I would have a key to let myself in the house, but subjected to this kind of life, I might choose to move elsewhere. Basically the author is devoted to the concept of positive reinforcement with total parental control. More caring, respectful paths are described in other books. The trees to make this book were wasted. . ."
4,Purchased These Shoes For My Daughter,I purchased these shoes for my 12 year old daughter. She saw them on a movie star/singer and thought they were cute. She likes them. They seem soft and comfortable. She has been wearing them on and off for a month now and they seem to be holding up. Overall a great shoe. I might buy a pair for myself to try them out.
2,Not very good,This is not a good goggle for those who swim laps...It is a good recreational goggle though...
5,"Finally, some interesting children's music!","Dog On Fleas combines witty lyrics with amazing instrumentation on this CD.You will listen to Dog On Fleas long after your kids grow up. Dance worthy, and sing-along perfect.HIghly recommended by me and my two sons, ages 5 and 2."
3,Telescope Shortcomings,The telescope is dissappointing. It is difficult to focus and the magnification is much less than I anticipated. I have yet to be able to use the extension eyepiece.
4,Joovy caboose,I so far love it I'm just still trying to figure out the best way to fit it in my minivan:)
3,It fits them but no usable storage....,"Having a double/triple stroller is great but it is big barely fits in the back of my Mini-Van. It has a huge storage basket on the bottom but it is hard to get anything in or out of it. It doesn't come with a cup holder for parents. I think there should be shoulder straps on the sit and stand seat, if the child wants out of the seat they can get out easily. But for the price you really can't beat it."
5,Their Best CD(until the next one),"I feel that 'Marigold Sky' is Hall and Oates best CD to date. All the songs are great. My cousin, who is not a Hall and Oates fan even liked it, because she said ""it didn't sound like ""Hall and Oates"", so coming from her, it must be good. My favorites, are 'Want To', Love out Loud, Romeo is Bleeding, and the ballad of 'Promise Ain't Enough'. Five star plus music."
5,It's the only music we listen to in the house!,My entire family loves the music! I have a 2 year old son that asks for their music rather than Pooh. My wife and I love it all - we frequently find ourselves dancing and listening to the powerful words in their songs. My parents are often busted at red lights bopping their heads and mouthing the lyrics.
1,Carrier is a deluded atheist.,"Mr. Carrier's book is more diatribe and less facts. He waffles his way through his book in an attempt present an alternative interpretation of life known as ""naturalism."" This book is merely a poorly written excuse to leave God. I recommended for intellectual midgets."
3,What happened?!?!?!?!??!?,"I mean come' on. All of the other pokemon were ok but this one......... is...... kindy werid. I mean, you'll sit down and play it for 15 mins. So do yourself a favor and rent it(buy a diff. game)"
4,An entertaining film,"I am really glad when I see films that are outside of the norm. ""Real Women Have Curves"" is one of those films. The main character, a young woman about to graduate from high school, really isn't that over weight if you ask me, but I guess by Hollywood's standards she is overweight. The main character seems to have a chip on her shoulder, and her mother seems so old I thought that the mother was her grandmother. The women in the story work hard to make a living and the brat main character never misses a chance to provide them with a snide remark, showing off the smarts that she thinks that she has. Her bad attitude almost causes her sister some problems. The attitude of the main character is poor and I don't know if she would be considered a role model, but the film itself is entertaining."
4,Showing my Professor what I've learned,"This film has relevance toward the lives of many young girls today. It illustrates how expectations on women, especially those of lower economic status, can cause hardships for young women. Carmen sets many stereotypical expectations on Anna as to how a proper Latina girl should act and grow as a woman. Anna, on the other hand, wants no part in domestication, and to be looked upon as an object for men. She realizes she's very curvy, but finds that she does not have to hide this just to be noticed by men; she does not have to partake in a stereotype just to please her mother, or to become and object for the `male gaze'. Anna's character criticizes society's expectations on women, and reminds us that even a woman, a Latina woman with little money, can break free from the ""proper"" feminine characteristics and expectations; ideals passed down through the generations. Anna also reminds us that real women are not stick thin and are still beautiful and strong."
3,Its a good movie but...,"Its a good movie but i was a bit dissapointed. it would of been much better if 1.the mom had realised woman can do stuff like go to college too. 2.the sister had raised the prices on the dresses so that the factory got more money. 3.the sister started her own shop with dresses for heaver woman. 4.ana had seen her boy friend again. i don't think you should buy this movie but to rent it, its great!"
3,"a simple, but well deserved film!","This film tells the story of a ""typical"" L.A. Mexican family living in the U.S. Ana wants to be the first to leave the nest and does so by attending college.THe story is one that is great to be shown on the screen, but it was highly predictable. The characters were not too indepth and not much depth to the film in all.The storyline is pertinent to many real-life situations today and something interesting to show for English-speakers who may not be fully aware of customs and challenges of spanish-speaking cultures that are in the US."
5,Feel Beautiful!,"This movie should make most women, regardless of size, feel sexy and beautiful. I loved it and wish all young women could feel as accepting of themselves as the main character. Not only will the movie make you feel great, it is anything but superficial. In addition to promoting a healthy body image, it provides an examination of the conflict between traditional views and modern views within a Mexican-American family in Los Angeles, especially in regards to the role of women in the family and larger culture. The movie also shows the real-life reality of sweatshop workers and the horrible gap between what they are paid to make clothing and how much the clothing sells for in upscale department stores. It makes you think about how women of different cultures and classes are severely disconnected. There is so much to this movie! I cannot recommend it enough. The final 15-20 seconds keep replaying over & over in my mind. I found it so wonderful."
3,Well acted but lacking...,"With the author of the play that inspired the movie acting a small role I'm left wondering how she knowingly allowed her plot to be so twisted. Although the movie is contains great performances by the actors, is well directed, and delivers quite a few laughs, the play should also be considered by those who enjoy the movie and it's message.The play presents the feminist latino perspective that women can achieve success without men and regardless of their social status and class as long as they can rely on each other. The movie seems to focus on a young woman's need for higher education and the main character seems relies on men to confirm her existence and leaves the women behind for Columbia University in New York.If you're just looking for a few laughs stick with the movie but if you're interested in the message and the statement Josephina Lopez intended with her play it's a good read."
3,Too stereotypical!,This movie is such a stereotype not all latinos are dumb enough not to encourage their kids or not all latinos are gardinerosor are catholics and are doomed to be unsuccesful. I hated it . but i do hope that if there are latino families like that they change fast to bring up the family.
3,THREE STARS,"Praise for a good movie that breaks your conventional sterotypes, not just culturally but across the board as far as body image is concerned. Wonderful movie with a ""real"" cast. I give it three stars only because I was disappointed with it based on my expectations."
1,reticle shift,"I put this on a 10/22, shot it a few times to adjust, and the reticle shifted 45 degrees on the scope. If i return it to tasco they want $10 for postage and handling plus they are willing to refurbish it for a ""reasonable cost"" whatever that means, plus it'll cost me to send it to them. My mistake was that i didn't fire it quick enough and my return time to amazon expired. I bought this in August 2012."
5,"Good product, but......","I've been a fan of this product for about 12 years now.....it is easy, fast, healthy and delicious....but I have to gripe about the price.....less than ten years ago it was about $23 a case (shipped) now it's over $33Soon I'm going to stop buying it (like I have with so many other products) because they are (unjustifiably) raising the prices exponentially on a simple dried soy protein product. Realistically, it should be about $1 per box.America will pull out of this recession when we finally figure out that sticking it to ANOTHER American is not going to help pull us out of your financial problems, and when we decide NOT to stick it to the next guy to recover our lossesHaving said that, I still eat this product, but the price hike turned me off bigtimeIf I see it go up one more time, I will add it to my list of gouger companies, and never buy it again.At that point it will be cheaper to make my own."
3,"The World's Books: A Key to the Treasures of Literature, by Frank Parsons","A nice collection of some of the world's great literature, and especially for the price. A Kindle user will find it a nice addition to their library."
1,Horrible,"When i bought the Kajal Eyeliner i was expecting it to be like the Indian eyeliners. My mom always got me some from India, and they came on dark with no smearing, but after i received the eyeliner, it was soooo TINNYY... it looks really cute and stylish so i bought 2 one for me and one for my friend, it was her birthday and i was excited to get her one... she loves eyeliners. The shipping was okay, it came a day or two late. Anyway, before i gave it to my friend, i tested the one i bought for myself out. when applied it does look pretty, but i had to go over my eyes 10 times, because i like it dark. it was like a crayon, totally not what i was expecting. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, because its small, last maybe 2 weeks, and it take a while to apply if your looking for dark eyes. i'm not sure about the top lid as i only use it on my inner bottom lid."
2,Worthy but disappointing,"I really wanted to like this film.I love Richard Curtis's writing and Bill Nighy is just fantastic. I fully support the ""Make Poverty History"" campaign so I expected to adore this film, but after what seemed like about seven hours, I went and made a cup of tea.There was no action, and I don't mean car chases. No one did anything, nothing happened, they just sat and talked. It was too long and too preachy.An opportunity missed, I'm afraid, Mr Curtis."
4,Implausible but it works well,"Although the plot seems implausible, the two lead actors make the film work. 50-something British civil servant Lawrence and much-younger Gina meet in a cafe, seem to have a short, no-phyical-contact relationship, and he invites her to the G8 Summit in Iceland. After hearing about the summit attendees could make a difference in the plight of thousands of dying children, Gina voices her concerns in inopportune times. Sad, shy Lawrence knows Gina is a gem but reluctantly accompanies her to the airport. The sweet romance strikes just the right chord."
2,Judge yourself first.,"The concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded ""The Girl in the Cafe"" turned out to be a left-wing political message. I wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character ""Gina""? Gina browbeats the members of the G8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world, particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows. Does the thought ever cross her mind (or the person writing the script?) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS, all varieties of venereal disease, children born out of wedlock, poverty, etc? Maybe Gina should look at her own life before judging others so harshly.This movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an R rating for nudity and language."
5,Be the change the world is waiting for,"I loved this film. I loved the acting, especially of the young woman, and I loved the feeling I had for days after seeing the film....that each one of us in our own way contributes to the world, word by word. It's probably the most realistic film I've seen of how one person can make a difference."
4,Compelled to Watch.. not sure why..,"Despite a very liberal leaning political agenda - complete with Nelson Mandela quotes - and gratuitous nude scene smack in the middle of the movie (which apparently only served for the director David Yates or Bill Nighy to Kelly Macdonald without her top) this was an amazing piece of film work. The images of Iceland are stunning, and the angles and camera shots are riveting throughout.Despite the slow-moving plot; this is at times somewhat painful to watch, as a lot of British TV and film can be. However, Nighy and Macdonald make the story compelling to watch as two clearly introverted social misfits struggle to relate to one another.I found myself compelled to watch it a second time without a clear reason why.This is a good film for one of those evenings when you're looking for a little something more than just entertainment. Well done Yates - but next time, axe the nude scene."
4,As of 1/23/2011 this is the old version on Kindle,"I downloaded a sample--this is the old version. The new version is out but apparently not for Kindle. I have the old hardcopy, and I lost 2-3 pounds a week and was never hungry. Doctors would tell me I didn't have impulse control when it came to food. It turns out that is just BS, but was down on myself for years because I was hungry all the time. A co-worker was supposed to go on statins and didn't want to. I convinced him to try this for 6 weeks. His cholesterol plummeted. He lost 25 pounds over a few more weeks and his cardiologist was AMAZED that diet could do that.I only give it 4 stars because I didn't much care for the recipes and would have preferred more discussion. I want to get the newer edition, which addresses some objections such as using flax oil to cook. I never did use flax oil because the taste is too strong. Some of this information people object to is addressed on the author's website and you can sign up for a free newsletter."
3,Interesting,"It is a good review of what has been written before. I learned something from it, which was helpful."
3,diet book,"This book arrived in a timely manner. It has a lot of useful information, but I was hoping that there would've been more easy to make recipes in it."
3,Held my own,I need to lose weight and this diet really doesn't help in that aspect. It does help me hold my own and maintain my current weight. I do feel better but I still need to take off some pounds. To be honest i do have thyroid disease so weight loss isn't easy.
2,Difficult to follow,"I bought this book because a friend of mine swears by this diet. The diet was difficult to follow for me. The suggested meals were not things I believe the average person is putting together. Like crab legs for breakfast. Some of what the author says makes sense to me but restricting carbs isn't really anything new and there are more forgiving ways to do so than this. No dairy, no flour, no grains....no thanks."
4,Paleo Diet,The diet is a very eye opening way to look at the foods I was eating and learnig to eat better. The diet works!
4,It's OK,"Better than the average hack job but not as good as some Homer Kelly mysteries. Improbable plot and disconnected character development,"
3,Good stuff for the people who looking for classic film,I think it's contain a lot of name and people who are in That kind of business. But it's not really detail in depth. The bio of the people and the interview was good. The graphic is bad. Dont's expect about the explict picture. It's about porn but not porn stuff.
1,Confederate Heroes of Gettysburg,"This video stinks to high heaven. I don't understand how it could have been marketed. It is poorly conceived, poorly edited and poorly produced. It is narrated by the University of Georgia's Emory Thomas and Lesley Gore-Burr in flat monotones while reenactors ride around on horseback and march aimlessly. It is so poorly edited that the producers could not even properly match the photographs of general officers with the narration. The video is a total waste of money and time. It is so bad that I tossed it in the trash after one viewing."
3,just a belt with a leash,we got this to have hands free jogging w/ our dog. it does what is says - but the clip that attaches to the dog's collar actually broke easily once it had a strong pull. in the end this is just a leash with a belt - so you can make your own if you already have a leash and a belt.
4,Excellent resource,This book is a wonderful resource. Well-written and easy to read. Packed full of information. A wonderful guide to teaching online.
4,The crazy kill,"This books has a lots of characters, but they are easy to keep track of. It's the only book I've rear by Chester Hines, but I'll be looking for more written by him."
5,The best one since the third,"Totally awesome with an amazing plot that hooks you on right at the beginning. A betrayed legendary pokemon Lucario helps Ash find Pikachu who has been kidnapped by the playful Mew! Totally great graphics and sound, this is one that is really worth the money!"
1,It was the worst movie .,"I have seen other Pokemon movies, but this was the worst. The plot was bad and it did not have that many pokemon as I thought.And Mew does not fit in the story when it is about Lucario."
3,Okay DVD of a pretty good movie,"The movie itself is actually pretty good, with some nifty character development and some genuinely touching and funny moments. Lucario is a pretty cool character, with an extremely neat design and some cool abilities.However, the DVD is lacking in two crucial areas: Lack of a Japanese language track, and it's not widescreen. Having seen the widescreen version on Japanese import, the full-screen picture ruins a lot of the nice shots in this.Come on guys, get with the program and stop with the full-screen already! Also, an option to have the Japanese voices would also be amazingly appreciated."
5,An amazing tool,"The first and third in this series (Music for Reiki & MeditationandOcean of Silence: Music for Reiki and Meditation, Vol. 3) are amazing and this is no different. Extremely soothing and progresses my spiritually guided meditations deeper, faster. Good serene balance and great song length. Very highly recommended."
5,Wonderful!!,This has been a remarkable experience for me.. I have diffuctly walking but find the Labyrinth experience very insightful. Finding the Sand Labyrinth has given me a chance to have the same experience without the physical limitations.
1,Stop running the second day...,"Very nice watch, silver-white dial. I wear it one day, the next day it stopped and never started again. Take it for repair and the jeweler told me that it has a gear broken, and it is chinese made, no spare parts.....needs to change the movement or throw it out.Bad luck with this watch? I don't know, no more stuhrling watches for me."
1,Do not waste your time,"I bought this watch because most of the reviews seemed like this would be a good buy-- a $600 watch for $100! What a deal! My husband lost his Fossil watch that he loved, and this seemed like a comparable product. Fossil is a much better watch than this.HOWEVER, I was disgusted when I gave it to my husband as a surprise. The outer metal decorative faceplate was installed incorrectly. In the picture, the dot is over the 12 of the watch face; on our watch, it was over the 10! So good luck using that in the dark. I would expect that lack of quality from a $20 watch, not an originally-priced $600 watch or even a $100 watch. Those details matter! Also, my husband couldn't set the time. That little pull out piece would not budge, not even with tools. This screams poorly made.I am disgusted and disappointed with the quality of this product. Thank goodness it comes with free returns! Don't waste your time on this watch Spend your money on a product that will last."
1,What in God's name am I listening to?,"There's absolutely NOTHING to this music. It's atonal garbage. If you flushed your toilet 50 times and recorded it it would make a better record. I saw these guys live and they were probably the worst band to ever play in front of a live audience. This ""music"" is a complete waste of your life."
4,primal,"this is a great EP. very raw and primal but still shows great skills in writing in this genre, as the garage rock genre is very riff based. i would give it a 5 out of 5 but i think the EP lacks consistancy and flow, as it starts off very rock and roll, then goes heavy, then finishes with almost a ballad. definately a well thought out EP."
4,volumizer,"I bought this product after a few years of using Amplify by Matrix and really liked the KMS Volume shampoo. It doesn't make your hair smell as nice as Amplify but I think, for volume, it's better.Amplify: Volume - 4 stars Scent - 5 starsKMS: Volume - 5 Scent - 3 stars"
3,Ok,"The movie was Great, but Anne Hathaway didn't do a great performance in my opinion. I had liked her in The Princess Dairies, but she just didn't go with this movie. So it kinda makes it less interesting when you don't have characters (actors) that don't go with the movies."
4,A fairly successful adaptation,"I recently watched this one, and thought it was quite an amazing accomplishment. Although not quite as Dickens penwork itself, it did have a good presentation. The acting was well versed and so were the characters with an adequate and acceptable british exposure. The story itself was a speculation in Dickens' terms, and was well serverd to keep it's place.Charlie Hunnam quite extrodinarily fitted to his character symbolizing good, Plummer with his symbolizing evil, and Jamie Bell the victim of the clash of both worlds. Jamie's performance of Smike was really touching and was able to draw the sympathy that he much deserved. The others contributed very well. A special mention about the humorous theatre troupe & the Cheeryble Brothers. Weren't they fascinating ? ;)Overall the movie was a fairly successful attempt in appraising the morality of our world and of Dickens as he would have put in, there will always be day when goodness overcomes evil! So long!"
3,"Good film, strange cast.....","Not being a Dickens fan, I bought the film as the reviews were positive. Great story- classic good wins over evil. Christopher Plummer is exceptional as always, Jim Broadbent is completely convincing as a despicable, schoolmaster. Juliet Stevenson is quite scary as the schoolmasters wife. Anne Hathaway portrays her role well, and the boy who plays Smycke is wonderful. So I am confused by the casting of the lead character. His voice is monotone throughout, his acting is so below par with the others that it conspicuously stands out. It was almost painful for me to watch the scenes when he had to show some emotion. With such a well-rounded, richly talented cast, he stands out like a sore thumb for his lack of talent.This was a disappointment, so that, I wish I had only rented it as opposed to buying it."
5,"Lex, no one could have said it better","I can't Say enough about this book. It is written so well and it expresses the feelings of so many young black females in this world. I'm 15 and i've felt almost everything Trek feels in the book. From sneaking boys in the house to feeling like my mom and I can't connect. This book is a book that makes you wanna read it. To call it a page turner would only be telling half the story. All i can say is this book needs to be hands of every child in the WORLD. Alexus, YOU GO GIRL!!! :)"
2,Hmmmmm,"Being an avid Eagles fan I have over the years picked up just about everything available that allows me to learn a little more of the guys whose music I cherish. When I purchase a book I would expect it to be well researched and perhaps contain information gleaned from the Horse`s mouth. This book seems to have been written after the author watched Hell Freezes Over as he quotes liberally from a video which and correct me if I`m mistaken, virtually every Eagles fan has seen multiple times!?! Other quotes, stories and ditties are common knowledge to Eagles fans, or available by reading web sites, articles, etc. Therefore whilst mildly enjoyable, the nature of the material renders this publication superfluous unless you are only mildly interested in the Eagles. I believe a better read is the Marc Eliot, ""To the Limit"" slightly more sensational and some people say inaccurate, but better than The Long Run by some."
3,Good and bad,"I've read most of the reviews for this item and have had this DVD player for almost a year now. I haven't had any problems with it until just recently. During the play of a movie, it starts to cut out and lag terribly. If the player is stopped and opened and resumed, it seems okay. Gotta love that lastplay feature. It's almost like it's over heated or something and needs a 'rest' for lack of a better term. Unlike most, I purchased mine at a Sam's club for about 30 to 40 dollars, I really can't remember how much, it's been so long. It's small, has more features that expected and plays well until the last part of the movie. I think I'd hold on on buying another one to replace it and just go for a better brand with less features next time. But until it doesn't work. I have no problems."
1,just don't,"I bought the 300 player more than a year ago... and it still works fine... it's starting to have some slight problems, but they don't get in the way of the play back of any movie. So about 3 months ago I decided to get another one for my dad... and it worked fine at first, but a couple of days ago it started to freeze at the middle of the movies and locks up. And I have to return it to cyberhome directly and it's [...] Flat Rate Labor Charge."
5,Plays Almost Everything,"It plays almost everything you throw on it. DVD-R, DVD+R, VCD, DVD, etc. For the price we bought 3 for the last 3 years. One of them is now broken, but so is my 75$ Phillips, and my older Sony that costs 4 times but is now obsolete.We have one in the car. For its size it is really very portable. This little guy is progressive and 5.1 Audio - amazing. 5.1 uses a single cable to relay the signal to your receiver.My complaint is that the remote is not very easy to operate. Also, do not lose the remote as it is next to impossible to navigate the menus using the main unit alone."
3,A good little DVD Region Free player for the price,"I own 2 of these inexpensive Cyberhome DVD Players. I bought them because they can play Multi Regions... Meaning I can watch DVD's from Europe, Asia etc. I have had my 2 Cyberhome Units for over 2 years now and thus far they still work great. The Picture playback using a Pal German Movie was perfect and the sound Quality is good.... I would highly recommend this anytime for someone who isn't looking to spend a fortune on a DVD Player that will play all Regions... This is a great buy..."
1,Won't work after first year,CyberHome CH-DVD 300S Progressive-Scan DVD Player worked fine without any issues the first year. But in the second year it started geting stuck in between while playing dvd's & vcds. Right now i am not able to use it at all.won't recomennd this product.
1,Cheap but unreliable (avoid Cyberhome products),I was excited about the low price... but after 2 months I've had lots of problems.My first unit made very loud noises while playing. I returned it under warranty...The new unit I received worked for about a week and now will not play any DVDs.I have made 2 attempts to contact customer support to RMA my 2nd player and have not heard back from them.
5,Good item for good price,I liked this DVD player so much. I use it for MP3s also. Using since 1.5 years. Good working condition so far. Also can be used for 220Volts
3,Play Stops Working,After about 18 months my CyberHome CH-DVD 300S stopped working with the same symptoms as several other reviewers. I am going to try the cleaning exercise that was reported to fix it.I have an earlier CyberHome DVD player that continues to run fine after more than 5 years of service.
1,Freezes constantly..do not buy!!,"stupid thing freezes...and will not ""unstick"" ..eject start all over and it freezes again..put the same dvd in my computer...reads with out a hitch. Very annoying will play a dvd one day and start it up the next day...and it will not play 2 minutes without gettin stuck. try another brand....."
2,"Great features, one fatal flaw","Despite all the great features -- multi-region capability, plays almost any disc, etc. -- this unit has one fatal flaw. That is, when it's turned off, it continues to draw enough current that it stays warm to the touch. Initially, although I can't imagine why it should need to do so, I didn't think it was a big deal.Then a few months later, the unit conked out. It powers up, but it no longer puts out a usable signal. Lots of snow, no color, rolling picture, etc.I can only guess it's because something in the electronics overheated and failed.So, if this unit appeals to you, I highly suggest plugging it into something that will cut power to it when you're not using it. Something such as a power strip or a switched outlet on your home theater receiver or cable box.If you plug it into the wall or another always-on outlet, don't be surprised if a few months later you find it has baked itself into becoming a high-tech doorstop (like mine)."
1,Piece of Junk,"All I can say is Cyberhome is the worst DVD player I have ever had. I had problems with it the first week I owned it and all I do is play movies, nothing fancy. It couldn't even do that right. Would not load half the time. Do not purchase this product. Spend the money on a much better brand, it will be worth it........."
2,****NOT a multi-disc player,"This may be a good player, but be careful. I did a amazon search under ""multi-disc dvd player"" and this was listed. When I contacted the vendor and advised him, he said he would take it back less 20% restocking. This is not a multi-disc player"
2,Dont Rely on Cyberhome Rebate,"[...] It's Good for 240V usage and you can play VCD's. You can keep it as a back up to watch 240V, PAL based video."
4,"Excellent, and so compact",This is the perfect dvd player for our bedroom. Where we are short on space this a great compact dvd player. Easy to use and the clarity is good.
2,A lemon of a DVD player,"The one good thing about this DVD player is that the picture is excellent. The DVD won't load right away - you have to eject it - if you can get it to eject-and put it back in and finally it will load. Often after you've paused it the subtitles will come on. With the last movie I watched, after we'd stopped the film, when it resumed it had commentary coming on. it took forever to get that not to play. it came with a remote with many, many buttons. Few did what they were supposed to do. Shop on, and pass this product. Wish I had."
2,2 of 2 units failed,"This unit seemed like a good purchase due to its small footprint and low price. I purchased two units for my home and have been very disappointed.The first unit never worked properly: many DVDs simply would not play. Others stopped playing partway through, pausing for 10 seconds or more, or entirely locking up the unit (which required unplugging the power cord to resolve).The Second unit worked very well for about six months, although for some reason, this one did not have a volume control like the first one did. I was particularly impressed that such an inexpensive machine was able to re-sync the audio track as needed. However, it started doing the same thing as the first unit -- and then it died entirely.Overall, this product has good features, but it fails miserably in the reliability department."
4,good service with small flaws,Purchased in 2003 so I've had it for roughly 6 years. $30 got me a DVD player that plays almost everything. All original DVDs and recordable DVD media works great except it's picky about recordable dual layer DVDs. There seems to be an occasional video-audio synchronization issue that crops up if you repeatedly stop/pause/rewind/ff. It doesn't happen often enough to bother me and I'd put up with alot more for a $30 player going on 6 years of use. nice.
4,SUPER FOR THE PRICE,"Just what we wanted - unobtrusive, diminuitive, 5 minute hookup, ideal for rental dvds...."
1,Piece of junk! Even for $30,I did not expcet much from this DVD player because we only spent $30. BUT it played about 5 DVDs and died! Spend the extra money and get a better player!
2,It freezes all the time,"Cheap.If you're lucky, you'll be able to watch an entire movie without problems. But they generaly come.Mine is not noisy. But this freezing problem really bothers me. I intend to buy a more reliable unit (Sony, Panasonic)."
5,GREAT PLAYWE!!! IT PLAYS EVERYTHING!,This player is really great for the low price that it sells for. It plays any format DVD and I am very happy about this because I watch movies coming from europe and africa so I do need the flexibility.Definitely a good buy!!
1,Just did not work,"It just didnt work, bought it for cheap so i didnt expect much.It just didnt play the dvds that well, glitches hickups not recomneded."
1,Horrible player,I had to junk this only after 6 months worth of use. The sound was always horrible and it is makes a lot of background noise.The picture is awful as well.
4,I am so happy with this product!,"I think this is a fantastic DVD player for the price. I have not noticed the noisiness that others have commented on nor had any problems playing various formats of dvds and dvd-rs and such. I just really don't think you can beat this product for this price. I bought it with very low expectations relying on the fact that I could return it if it was awful and it has been a pleasant surprise. It has a very clear picture, is totally easy to set up and figure out the remote, and does all the basic things that you would want from a dvd player. I can't complain."
3,Pretty bad,"The only reason I bought this is that it supports upto 240 V (for gifting to someone in India) and has multi-region support.However, it does not play more than half of my DVD collection. Those that play get stuck mid-way. This does not happen with my other DVD player."
2,Already having problems..,"Less than a year ago I purchased this unit from Best Buy, the price was great at between $35-$45, and we needed a simple dvd player for the bedroom. We probably used it less than 2 dozen times since purchasing it, and now it freezes up towards the end of some 2 hour movies. I can tell this thing is going to die out pretty soon. The crappy remote alone should have given me the idea that this is garbage. Try something in the $50-$70 range instead, preferably with a good brand name product, if you want your dollar to last awhile."
1,Junk Player. I will never by this brand,"I ordered this player month back. After waiting for 20 days, I received the player.When I tried to play a DVD movie, only first ten minutes it played the movie in color, then color changed to pink and finally it displayed only Black and White.I called Cyberhome support, I did all kind of troubleshooting as per cyberhome supports instruction. No luck. Then I called Amazon, they said they will replace the unit.Last week I receive the my replacement unit. I think this unit is comparatively better. The reason is, it displayed the DVD movies in color for 20 to 30 minutes. And it goes to pink and finally Black and White.Today I am returning this unit also.It you check Cyberhome's web site support page, they say it you see pink are Black and White picture adjust the DVD setup. That is not true. It didn't work for the player I got it.This player is not even worth for single star."
1,Please Dont buy it,"I got this DVD player, i started playing DVDs, its stops playing in the middle then keep searching the tracks. Dont waste ur time and money on this piece of JUNK. It would be good if u invest on a better DVD player."
3,"It's OK, But not Great!","It does not play ALL dvd types like it is advertised to. It will play dvd+ disks all day long. But put in a dvd- disk and all I get is a ""no disk"" message. I took it back to Bestbuy and exchanged it. The second one is the same way. For the money it's a good machine. However, It is NOT as discribed in the advertisment and in the operating guide."
4,Beefs and Bouquets,"I agree with much of what has already been said. This is an easy-to-follow, attractive and well-paced video.I am not a confident dancer, and the slow pace of the video was helpful.However, the video doesn't really stand up to repeated viewings, if you have learned the basic steps.Also, I wanted to note that the voice-overs are not always well synched with the movements, which can throw off your rhythm a bit.All the same, I'm looking forward to being challenged by the next one!"
2,Along Came another mediocre read.,"I still maintain this opinion: when I run out of new stories by the really great writers like Lawrence Block, Joe Lansdale, Robert Parker and Dean Koontz, I start looking for mediocre writers to fill my reading time. Authors like Stephen King, John Saul, Jonathan Kellerman and James Patterson spring immediately to mind.I get no feeling from any of these characters! They are not real to me, they hold no interest for me. It's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind -- profound mediocrity.The scenes are also dull and choppy. I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere.I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author. I am glad I borrowed them from the library! I shall not read this man's works any more; there's only so much bad literature that one can tolerate before one is compelled to expel it all..."
4,Good keep your intrest book,I read this book very fast I could not put it down. The way the book was written you needed to know what was going to happen next. I loved it so much I just can't wait to read the next one in the series.
2,Slow...,Compared to other books by him its too slow and boring. Has to force myself to finish it. Women's murder mystery was way better
5,Oldie but Goodie!,Patterson at his best with one of his best characters. Alex Cross and his supporting cast take you on a great psychological journey into the mind of criminals and the greedy. One book will get you hooked.
4,Patterson- Along came a spider,Well written and toches upon many social issues as well as a very good murder/kidnapping mystery. Like the way Detective Cross uses his Psychology expertise to get into the head of the criminals.
3,Spider,"The title seems to have no connection, but the story is good. The end just seems to happen fast and good bye. Not like the several others I've read. I'll try another though."
4,"Good, fast read","I have never really found a mystery series or novel that I've truly enjoyed every aspect of. That includes ""Along Came a Spider."" Regardless, this first book in the Alex Cross series was a perfect Sunday afternoon read, switching points of view between the hero Doctor-Detective Alex Cross and the villain. I would say the intricate plotline and psychological perspective more than made up for a somewhat boring (at least initially) romance, but still had to take off one star for the oh-so-cliche wounded hero meets attractive romantic interest."
5,GREAT,"So many plot twists, I couldn't put it down. What a story by James Patterson, I can't wait to read his other books."
5,Excellent!!,Cat and Mouse is the best book I have ever read. I could not put it down for one moment. I give this book 2 thumbs up. A must read for anyone who loves horror/mystery books. This was my first James Patterson book and it is not my last.
1,"Boo, hiss on publisher's Kindle pricing!","I've been looking forward to trying out the Alex Cross series but wanted to wait and buy it for my Kindle. (I'm running out of shelf space for my print books!) But I refuse to pay more for an e-book than I would for the mass market paperback--especially not $2 more! I've been in the publishing industry for 15+ years, and I know from the inside how unnecessary that is (especially for a backlist best-seller such as this one, which has already paid for itself). Little, Brown, please be reasonable and reconsider! I won't be trying this series at all until the Kindle edition is priced lower than the paperback. And that is a real disappointment because I've been so looking forward to finding a new one to follow!"
5,Enjoyable Read,"I really enjoyed this book, I have read others of the Alex Cross series and wanted to start at the begining so I bought this one. It was exciting and had a lot of great twists."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This book is one of a series, it appears. A highly competent investigator has to track down a killer of the serial variety, who, is most definitely crazy.There is also a female FBI agent involved, and it appears that she is most likely more than a little bit dodgy, as well. A dick, deaths and a dodgy dame."
2,"Good God, the agony!","Maybe I should have given it 1 star instead of 2, but I thought I'd be generous. The plot is not terrrrrrrible, but even before the ""twist"" at the end it's hard to swallow. And the twist - why do some authors think that making the most unlikely character the ultimate villain will make a book better? Is it just that they can't figure out how to end the things otherwise? (I guess the villain wasn't the MOST unlikely - it could have been the grandmother, but Patterson'll probably save that for a later book.)"
2,How a book like this can become a bestseller is beyond me.,This popular and highly acclaimed novel is amateurishly written and incomplete. It belongs with the works of Clive Cussler. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on a John D. MacDonald or James Lee Burke.
4,Another must read,I am working my way through the Alex Cross series and am truly enjoying each book. I will be reading more of Patterson's books when I finish this series.
1,Extreme Boredom!,"This is the worst ""biography"" I've ever read. So much that it took me more than a year to complete.It's just a succession of VERY long-winded, very boring critiques of each of the writer's plays. Biographical facts are only half-heartedly tacked on at the start, and reading them I came to find out that I didn't even like Orton and his ""friend"" and felt they got the exact fates they deserved.This book was so stagnant and such a frustrating read that I actually began to hate the author! I wish I had NEVER ordered it."
1,Horrible!,"This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!"
5,Conker could kick Mario's ...[but]@$$ any day!,"Well, its true. Anyway, I haven't officially BOUGHT the game yet, I just keep on renting, and renting, and renting, and renting, ect. This game is definately one of the greatest games available for the N64. First up is graphics. They are beautiful. BFD looks as good as Banjo-Tooie, while keeping a smoothe framerate. Next, we have music. Instead of the normal MIDIs that dribble out of games, BFD uses MP3s for its music, and it really does show. Also, the Great Mighty Poo's song is SOOOOOOOO catchy. 3rd, we have voices {for once}. They are great. Conker has an endearing little lisp, Berri {Conker's girlfriend} has that like, y'know, Valley Girl talk. All of the voices are incredibily done. And, most importantly, humor. This game is funny, but in that South Park kind of way. Also, to Nintendo, if you ever make a Super Smash Brothers 2, BE SURE TO PUT CONKER IN IT! Because we all would like to see who the REAL king of the video game mascots is."
2,Really interesting! One hell of a find!,This author who took the time to actually present himself with an upclose and personal view of what prison life is like is profound. I personally have always been interested in the curiosities that surround prison life and this book really answered alot of the questions i pondered. This man who set out to find answers really intrigued me. In fact I was so interested that I couldnt put the book down!
5,Transitional,"I have to confess that I prefer the earlier Rambler albums that were more old-time, but there is a lot of good material on here and they are always excellent musicians. This is sort of transitional between the earlier string-band stuff and the later music with more pop, swing, rock, and Celtic influences."
3,See for another aspect of the New York underground,"EMPIRE is a carefully thought out approach to the question of ""What would the little drug dealers in New York do if they had the chance to make money legitimately?"". Too often we see these gangsta movies that are just caught in the glue of the drug world, rarely advancing out of it. In EMPIRE John Leguizamo makes us believe in his character, in his striving to get out of the drug world to make a life for his girlfriend and incipient family. There are clever twists and turns and it is great to see the 'bad guy' be the uptown Ivy League manipulator. The cast is strong, the photography is good, the narration of the story by Leguizamo is enlightening, and the movie takes us where others are afraid to go. Worth your time."
2,very disappointing,"This movie is very disappointing, it almost sucked. John's acting is the only thing that made this movie interesting, the whole LONG build up to this big deal doesn't pan out & the ending is a cop-out, don't waste your time. There are better things to do with 2 hours of your life."
4,9 out of 10 stars for Empire,"I have my own rating system I give a certain amount of stars based on the movie's good and bad qualities out of 10, for instance in the case of Empire I give the movie a 9/10. here are my reasons for giving the movie this grade:Positive: The movie shows what the life of being a drug dealer is like without sugar coating it. It's good to show the people in the drug dealing business what can happen if you mess around with the wrong people. The plot is great and the acting is superb. John Leguizamo is at the top of his game in this movie. It's really entertaining.Negative: There is an abundance of strong language in the movie. Not as much as 8 Mile, but pretty close. There is also graphic violence too, which I almost couldn't handle.If it wasn't for the graphic violence and language, the movie would have been a perfect 10! But anyway, it's a great movie to watch if you're looking for something good."
2,"Poor Man's ""Carlito's Way""","Actually, this movie could be a spin-off of the ""Carlito's Way"" character, Benny Blanco from the Bronx, also played by John Leguizamo. The story is pretty much the cliched druge dealer trying to go straight routine but yet everytime he tries to get out....they pull him back in! Leguizamo is also just not believable as a major tough guy drug kingpin. A gay hairdresser from Queens? Yes. A macho drug dealer? No. Also what good is having Denise Richards in a movie if she's not going to be naked? That's like putting Arnold Schwarzenegger in a movie where he doesn't kill anyone. It's pointless."
5,Speckled Like A Trout,"Some reviewers tell the whole story in a paragraph like this, which I will refrain from doing. That would take away the entertainment value of reading the book. Suffice it to say that, of the 50+ books I read a year, this one is one of the top 5 of the year. It has a very interesting voice (a child's perspective), and story (one Irish parent, one German parent, and their children who live in Ireland after WWII) that certainly makes you think about one's place in the world and also one's perspective of history. I highly recommend reading this book."
3,Ok movie,This daring film revolutionizes the female status quo and will make you think... DVD has English subtitles option. I would recomment this movie: it is ok.
4,"this was my Jam from ""Velvet Rope""","this was easily my Jam off Her ""Velvet Rope"" easily&the Mixes are tight as well.the Original is tight though.A Really Good Jam To Bop Your Head to."
5,"This isn't just a kiddie game, it's very deep","Paper Mario is not a kid's game. Well, it's actually for all ages, from 6 to 106. It is extremely deep, with challenges, letters to deliver, many towns to visit, dojos to go to, etc. Even though it's not developed by Squaresoft like the original (Super Mario RPG), it still delivers an exciting quest. This is very very addicting, and will have you saying, ""Just a little more"" every five minutes. While I'm not exactly fond of the paper look, it is a clever way to get rid of the N64 blur effect. If you're wanting to experience the only great RPG on the N64, look no further. Buy now."
5,Nintendo Game Of The Year,Whoever said this game stinks is full of humbug. This game should win Nintendo Power's game of the year award. The graphics and gameplay are excellent.
3,Game is good but battling needs improvement.....,"The game is really good. Good graphics and all. But the battling wasn't as good as it could be. I wouldn't recommend buying this game because it is like a Super Mario 64 but much worse. If you like Mario Games buy Super Mario 64 or buy Zelda: The Legend of the Ocarina of Time. Those games were much better than Paper Mario. I beat Paper Mario in 5 days and was left bored in the end. The makers of the game should have put more thoughts into this game.The story is pretty good and the setting and graphics exceeded my expectations but the battling, like I already said, didn't. I thought that it would be the best game and even better than Super Mario 64 but it wasn't. Don't let the ad fool you. It's like a bad graphic Super Mario 64."
4,Don't throw this paper away!,"You've gotta try this game!But if you do,don't just judge it by the beginning.At first,there's this big talking story that goes on,but when it's over with,it's better.The game has a lot of cool items and the scenes are great!! It has like a flat 3D effect that i've never seen.I suggest you try this out!! ... ... ..."
5,a very great game!,paper mario is one of the the best games iv ever played its pretty much mario rpg only its for n64 and well the characters are paper.it has many dungeons and castles to have you stumped for a while and bad guys out there to catch your intrest too.and while your not at a dungeon you can do some sider adventures too. like maybe go deliver some letters or go cook sommething with tayce.t{a toad that loves cooking}go to the game corner or even just go visit some of your friends everywhere in mushroom kingdom.theres always stuff you can do on paper mario i reccomend you buy it its a great game.
5,The Most Action Packed Game I know.,"It is probably the most fun game for N64. It seems like the adventure Keeps going, and thats what makes me come back to my room and play. Thats what I like in a game! I hope that they put out more games like it!!!!"
4,VERY fun game,"I really enjoyed Paper Mario. I finished it within a week, but that was only 'cuz I rented it and I don't like returning a game I haven't beaten. It probably would've taken me a lot longer if I hadn't been so dedicated to it. The battle sequences are a lot of fun, especially once you upgrade your party members. I was a little disappointed that the BP(Badge Points) maximum was 30, which means Mario is limited to activating a very few powers at a time. Still, that did not deter me. It also would've been nice if the Castle was back on the ground after you beat it, but that may be good for some people 'cuz you can go back and battle Bowser again after you have beaten it. I felt that way about Ocarina Of Time, 'cuz the bosses were so cool in that game. But back to the topic, Paper Mario is definitely a great game to get if you like a good challenge and are willing to stick with it. Older gamers may feel it is too easy, though."
4,Roland was the best Cisco Kid.,"Gilbert Roland brought his own brand of suavity and charm to this role. He is a delight to watch as he charms the ladies. Had he been some years younger and not Hispanic, he could have made an impressive James Bond. Production values are quite good and the acting is top-notch, with such established performers as Evelyn Brent appearing in supporting roles."
4,"Not bad, but","The history aspects of this DVD are okay and cover the main issues with the Trotters, especially with the 1948 Lakers game, the 1952 Berlin Game with Jesse Owens, and the Trotters place in history. However, they could have included some profiles on the classic Trotters such as Goose Tatum, Meadowlark Lemon, Geese Ausbie (who is interviewed) and WHAT? Nothing on the beloved Curly Neal? Like hot dogs without the weenies!These items would have made good extras, along with some stuff from the HG cartoons of 1970 for a complete portrait."
2,Harlem Globetrotters,I bought this dvd because it stated it featured Meadowlark Lemon and Curly Neal in their day. From the description I thought it might have a lot of footage of them playing. In this I was very disappointed...practically nothing. It does give a great history of the Globetrotters which I do like but I just felt it was mis-represented.
1,Garbage,"If I could give it no stars I would. No Curley Neal. Trotters history? Give me a break. I'm still waiting for the definitive Globetrotter History. Needless to say, I'm not going to hold my breath."
5,Varjak paw,Varjak paw is a good book. It is good because it has a lot of emotion and action also all the charicters are cats! It is a good book if you like cats. It is kind of like the warriors series because it has a whole lot of action. I think it is a 5 star book.One thing in the book that I liked was when Varjak had to catch the pidgeons it showed bravery because Varjak could have died.
5,really nice,It's not a graphic novel but a little text book with B&W illustrations by McKean. Good gift for dears. Perfect story. Hope to see it in big screen.
1,Abgone - where did it go?,This product is what I understand to be an improvement over its predecessor - have to say for me that it makes me physically sick which the previous incarnation did not. I cant say either helped reduce my abdomen either...
1,poor product wont last,"I had Robo-Kleen in june 07 used it half of last year, this year it doesnt work. MFG says warranty expired too bad. Save your money."
3,I think it's just me..,"well personally, I was really excited to get this book. However, I found it hard to ""get into"". The book is well written and a local unitarian church LOVES to use this book for newcomers. I think it's just a toss up if your going to like it or not. It is well written though."
4,Easy Reading,"Well written, Bambi. Common sense info and an excellent reference document. I'll keep it handy."
5,This movie really choked me up.,"I am a great fan of Mystery Science Theater, and any chance I get to see an episode, I do, especially the retro ones, that I haven't seen before. I have to give them a hand on this one, for this touching storyreally choked me up. The MST3K crew really has a knack of taking cheesy old movies and turning them into great ones with their endless strings of one-liners."
2,MST3K's early years,"It's not a BAD effort, but it is from the first season (1989) and is really quite different than you may be expecting. Tom Servo has a different voice, and they are all green in the foreground instead of the black you may be used to seeing them in the theature. They are also kinda slow when it comes to offering jokes directed at the movie, so much so, you find YOURSELF making funnier ones without getting in their way. There are much better ones, so get it if you are trying to finish off your collection."
1,"Extruded, not cast, bad shipping and more!","I bought this for optics related work. First off, the rod was not packaged in a bag or anything, it was shipped bare inside a cardboard tube and had scratches, also, it had a label applied directly on the rod, super sticky and removing it with anything that would dissolve the glue would also stain the acrylic. Shining a light or laser through the rod, you can see the ""bumps"" of it being an extruded product, not cast. So this is completely useless for anything optics related... it may make for an expensive and cheesy towel rod!"
4,short bios of interesting women,"The author selected women who were brave and self-actualizing in an era when the barriers to that were high. The time span, 1850-1950, covers a vast revolution in all facets of society and in the status of women in particular. Each biography is several pages long, and most include a picture of the woman described. The writing is clear and should be readable for high-school students up, possibly for bright junior-high. The tone is level; the author appreciates these women but lets each story stand on its own. This is not a hagiography or a feminist tract in any way, but simply history well-told."
3,replacement corkscrew,"This item is labeled a Screwpull Corkscrew, but is not, in fact, a Screwpull product. I think the description is deceptive."
1,"I'll See You in Hell, Pikachu...","This game stinks worse than Pikachu's bum. He doesn't listen to a word my son speaks (or shall I say SCREAMS). His hearing is as bad as ancient Mew's. And mine is becoming equally as bad, having to widthstand the frustrating shrills eminating from my son's room day and night. This game has brought my son to tears. He has barely a social life, having spent his entire summer yelling at this hellish Poke-spawn. Run from this evil game, while there's still time..."
3,Hey You Pikachu is a fun time,"This is a really cute game that allows you to ""talk"" and interact with Pikachu. Please be advised that you NEED the voice recognition unit and a microphone to play this game."
1,Do not waste your money on this crud PEOPLE!,"This game is horrible, sure it is a cool idea to have finally a game with voice recognition but it has like 2 percent recognition . And the gameplay is horrible. All you do is go and look for food or play pinata or play catch with a beachball. Oh yeah the story is bad too but I am going to say goodbye now because I have better thingss to do than even talk about this stupid game. Don't buy it."
2,Bored very quickly,"I initially thought this would be great for my 10-yr old. He is heavily in to Pokemon both cards and Nintendo games. It was too high a price to pay for something that was played so little. He was easily bored after just a few times. At (this price) you really can't go wrong. Some kids may love it. But if your child is looking for the usual ""Pokemon action"" in a game, don't waste your money."
5,This book is excellent for learning linear algebra concepts.,"I think that this is one of the best books I have used for linear algebra. The concepts are well developed and easy to understand. As for the author , Howard Anton, he is excellent. To me, Howard Anton makes learning concepts simple and easy to understand. His books can teach a dummy. I recommmend this book to anyone who is studying linear algebra."
5,your prince is in effect... agian!,"the second season of the fresh prince was every bit as good a i thought it would be. every episode brings back memories of my first viewings of the show when i was a kid. i must say though, it took an unfair amount of time for season two to come out. the first season was realeased on the 8th of february and season two was released the eleventh of october. eight month's is way too long to wait for season two when there is (if i remember right) six seasons. if warner brothers keeps releasing them at this rate, it could be four years before we have all of our fresh prince seasons available. that is unacceptable by all means."
1,Defective Disks,"The item arrived in time but there is a problem with season 2. The episodes for disk three are missing. The episodes for disk 4 for is actually the epidoses for disk one. To make it worse, the episodes for disk 2 were on both disk one and disk two. But now I am out of six episodes and I cannot get it exchanged!"
1,Waste of time,"I was so excited to have order this Soul train DVD by Time Life but was so disappointed. DVD states performances by Luther vandross, the Spinners and Stylistics but it mainly featured the soul train dancers. Showed no performances by these artist except War. What a disappointed. I would never order another product by Time Life. Will wait until Don Cornelius or producers of Soul Train release the DVDs of the actual performances as viewed by us back in the 70s and 80s. You're better off saving your money. Very very disappointing. Shame on Time Life."
3,Order rectified ! Situation all good.,"I previously wrote a negative review. My appologies to Omar. At least Omar did contact me and was very anxious to clear up the mail delays. I give him credit for that . For my long delay and miscommunication my money was voluntarily refunded with out me asking. He does seem to care about his service. Flag arrived, our Olympics are saved . GO CANADAChris L."
4,iKlear Apple Product Cleaner,"The product works well. I would say the price seems a little excessive, but everything seems that way these days. I received the product faster than I expected. All in all, there is not a better product out there than iKlear to use for cleaning Apple products like computers, ipods and iphones. I use it for my MacBook Pro and it keeps my matte screen looking beautiful as it collects dust easily. I think Apple even sells it on their website at a higher cost. This is the cleaner to have for all Apple products."
1,Tastes like plastic,"I bought this mug to replace a similar item that had stopped heating. The new mug looks the same on the outside, but the interior is plastic rather than stainless steel. The visible plastic rim should have tipped me off, but I wouldn't have thought it could turn out this bad. It heats up just fine, but when it does, my coffee tastes more like plastic than like coffee. I tried washing it a couple times and heating up some soapy water in it, but the plastic taste remains. Keep searching until you find a heated mug that you can confirm has a non-plastic interior."
1,Cheap Chinese product,"The plug in on cup came loose on third usage. I then took it apart to see if I could snap it back in place, could not, would need glue. I noticed that heating element is held in place by thin masking tape that already had burn marks, which would have been after 2 uses, so I threw unit out. We bought two units and second unit is still functioning, have used it about 10 times. Also, first couple of cups had plastic taste. Old style was better, where stainless steel was on the inside of cup, plastic outside. These, plastic is on inside."
5,Becomes Believable,Fast shipping. Lots of twists and turns. Kristen Bell is great. Great characters and very good acting. Third season slows down but have to see it through.
5,A really great show.,"If your looking for something with everything, a great cast, story line, and writers who actually know what their doing, seroiusly watch this show & buy it on DVD. Its never boring, funny, sad, crazy but never boring. No matter what you like its got something you'll like and not to mention you'll get hooked on the story line. So yeah I think its a really great show and i dont really like most shows so thats something. Buy this."
5,Best Show Ever! I give it a million stars!,"This is the perfect show! I am very picky about what I watch, but I had no trouble with this show. It is the perfect mix of funny, dramatic, mysterious, and romantic. I can't wait for the third season to come out on DVD!"
1,Well let's face facts....,"Kristen Bell may be cute to look at, but her acting skills and the scripts for this show leave much to be worked over.I tried so hard to like this show, but between the bad writing and shallow characters. It's impossible. I think the Warner Brothers TV marketing Department came up with this show, very unoriginal."
5,not only for teens,"i found this dvd set quite by accident while browsing in the BX one day. I had never heard of this show since i am currntly living in England and it has just started to air over here. I bought it on a whim not even sure I would keep it. After the first episode I was hooked. As an adult its funny to watch the ""teen drama"" and remember all the stupid things that were so important than that so arent now. The mysteries are what kept me watching. It is a well written and highly entertaining show. I am anxiously awaiting season 2 to be released or aired over here."
5,Buffy's successor,"If you were one of those kids in high school that was wise beyond your years, a complete smartass, and fully aware that high-school was just a stepping stone to the next level, then this is your show.Veronica is 17 going on 40, and the supporting cast is pretty solid too. This is really a dialogue driven show, and although the action is good as well, it is written in a Wheaton-esque style that, if you are a fan of Buffy, you will dig."
5,A Critical Life-Skill For Every Person--Listening,"For more than 20 years, Dallas and Nancy Demmitt have been traveling across the United States, lecturing and demonstrating the skill of listening. With CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?, they've taken these crucial teachings and for the first time, put them into print.As bestselling author, Gary Smalley writes in the foreword, ""Listening can help you avoid misunderstanding and conflict, reduce false assumptions, stop the natural tendency to reach in the panic or crisis mode, and reduce fear, loneliness, and pain. As the Demmitts write"" 'Just showing someone that you are willing to listen--without condemning or judging them--will help to make that person feel valued, loved, honored, and appreciated.'""Everyone can gain or renew some valuable lessons from this book. I recommend it."
4,love the design,The steering wheel cover has great colors and looks awesome on the wheel.It was difficult to get to stretch to fit. You do need to follow the instructions and put it on during a warm day. The only drawback I have is that it is hot in the summer and very cold when the temp starts to drop. It was in the 30s this morning and the cover was freezing.
4,creative sync adapter,"We had an inital problem with the adapter, we were then sent a new one in a timely matter. The new adapter works perfectly. The seller responded to our problem by not only emails, but also by phone."
2,Spartacus,"I was disappointed in this film. I was hoping it was the one used for the film clips in ""Gladiators, Bloodsport of the Colosseum"" a video from Questar. That has some of the most powerful images I've ever seen relating to the Colossem or Circus Maximus. This film has a sound track more suitable to ""Bambi"" I had to turn it off. Pass it by."
4,Zelda Majora's Mask ROCKS HOUSE!,"I got this game, and was very happy with it. You start off with a nice walk through the woods, when the skull kid steals Epona, and takes your ocarina. You must find the ocarina and get it back, defeat skullkid, do some side quests, defeat majora's mask, and do 4 duengons in 72 minutes. The timing thing is kinod a a pain in the neck, but it adds depth to the gameplay. The witch sisters, and deku scrub palace sequences are a pain to do over again, but if you save correctly, you'll do just fine. GET A GUIDEBOOK THIS GAME IS HARD! You must buy it, though. IT ROCKS HOUSE!"
3,Majora's Mask,"The Cartridge did not appear to be in as good a shape as advertised. At first we had trouble getting it to work, but after several attempts, we did get it to work. It has worked okay since the initial problem."
5,Mojora's Mask,"The new Mojora's Mask will definately be the next best hit! With 24 different masks to collect (you will collect the 24th mask after you collected all the others) and each mask with different special abilities, the possibilities and fun are endless! Time will play a factor in this game, for you are trying to save Clock Town from destruction from an evil moon within 72 hours! You can ride Epon when your a child, too! The final battle in Mojora's Mask is you (with the 24th mask) v.s. Skull Kid, who steals your ocarina and horse in the beginning of your adventure!Bottom Line: get Mojora's Mask cuz you'll never know what to expect!"
3,"Ok, but could be better",Pros: New fairy(Tatl) Song of Time Transformation Powers All New Masks Cons: 3 days to finish game EVIL moon Lose some things while saving. MUST Start game as a weak Deku Scrub.
1,The Worst Zelda I Have Seen!!,"....Zelda MM is horrible! Unlike Ocarina, it has a time limit. I have had it for one year and I am still on the third temple. I have nothing but thumbs down for this Zelda! The time limit will get very frustrating after one hour. You only see Zelda once in the whole game, and you can't even get Epona until you beat the second temple. If you want to get a zelda game go for Ocarina of Time."
2,Horrible! Hardly worth playing...,"I simply did not enjoy this game at all! As Ocarina of Time was a great game :), this game was not a great sequel at all like everybody says it is :(. I first played this game on Zelda: Collector's Edition after playing Ocarina and I was immediately disappointed for several reasons:1. The style of gameplay is different.2. It's WAY too challenging, even though I like a challenge!3. Figuring out what you do first takes ages and ages.4. Dungeons are nearly impossible to beat, even with strategy.5. Not many places to save(without going back in time).6. Figuring out, even getting to the next dungeon is a pain in the neck!7. MAIN POINT: Only having three days to complete each dungeon is freaken annoying!Overall, this game sucks! Don't waste money on this game, regardless. Stick with Ocarina of Time or Wind Waker. ALL ZELDA FANS, PLEASE HEAD THIS WARNING!"
1,the game that everybody lied about,"All I ever hear is rent this game, buy this game, you'll love it. What a bunch of lies!!! What is up with the moon thing, I mean it's so pathetic. The game is supposed to last 72 hours but instead you have 1hour and 12 minutes to complete the WHOLE game! And if you don't finish the game in the time alloted you have to start ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!! Now I've played many N64 games and I have to say this is the most stupid, dorky, bezerk game in history. N64 games usually have great opening stories, explaining what the point is. Not this one, I've played it three times and I still don't the plot, or who's actually good. What a waste of my time. Save your sanity and your money, DONT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Majoras mask, & dark cloud Terrible games,","Ukiah Northern california,majoras mask Terrible game nintendo 64Dark cloud terrible too play station 2amazon review lies, making them up"
2,Majora's Mask blows (compared to Ocarina of Time),I was very excited when Majora's Mask came out because Ocarina of Time was the greatest video game of all time! What a disappointment. There were too many things going on at once in Majora's Mask and the time limit is too short. I made it to the 3rd level but the effort wasn't worth it because it wasn't fun. I traded it back and was much happier with the exchange!
2,THE OCRINA OF TIME IS MUUUUUCH BETTER!,"Well first off there is not much adventure, I mean your mostly in a town I mean how dumb, at first I thought it would be fun but now I know the truth. I give it one star becuse I really like links transformations. and two because you get to use adut wepons when you are a kid. I wouldn't buy this game unless you like to be bored. HAVE FUN..... NOT!"
1,Good bye NIntendo,"I have played the Zelda games from the beginning and have loved them. I was so anxious to get the latest, and then I was EXTREMELY dissappointed. I like the save feature so I won't have to go gather bombs, rupees, ect. THIS GAME DOES NOT SAVE YOUR INFO EVEN AFTER YOU GET THE OCARINA!! I lose points, any mazes I've cleared, rupees collected, ect. It is aBSOLUTELY HORRIBLE and I will never purchase another Nintendo game as long as I live. I can't believe they sold this as a ""saveable game"". I'm so sick of clearing the SAME MAZES again and again. It is NO fun, and I will probably sell this lousy game on ebay before Christmas to try to recoupe my loss. If Nintendo had informed me that my info wouldn't save, I wouldn't have wasted my money on this one :( 65.00 down the drain!!"
1,it sucks its a waist of money,it wasnt as good as ocraina of time my friend owns it i played it and he liked it but after a week it was boring it isnt as good as perfect dark.
1,Damaged Case,"When I received this product there was a large hole in the back of the packaging. It may not seem like a big deal to some people as long as the movie still works, but being a collector I was terribly disappointed by this."
3,The masterpiece that wasn't,"I wanted to love this film because I love David O. Russel: Three Kings is brilliant, Flirting With Disaster is hilarious and Spanking the Monkey had.....well it had balls, so to speak. Huckabees has balls too, but the underlying brilliance of the story is never fully realized. I'm not really sure why. The cast is great (Mark Wahlburg gives his best performance yet) and the premise is cool. It's the comedy that doesn't quite flow. It has some hilarious moments (mostly involving Wahlburg) but too many that don't work. I did enjoy the movie, and it does make you think about thinking. This really sums it up I suppose: its a movie about thinking about thinking. In the end it makes a good point but it I wanted a more compelling ride."
5,Comic relief for the existential search!,"The movie got only average reviews, so I waited until it came out on DVD. The story line turned out to be a pleasant surprise! For those of us who are on that spiritual search with in the confining ideas of Western society as we try to keep balance between our enviro-activism and corporate culture....this movies provides some comic relief to the philosophical and existential questions that swirl in our minds."
3,Tommy Corn is the ONLY good thing about this movie,"Mark Whalberg's character Tommy Corn was so great in this otherwise POS movie that I had to give it 3 stars. I've actually seen this movie several times just for his scenes alone. Marky Mark aside, this movie was the biggest waste of time. The movie tries to be artistic and thought provoking, but it just ends up being dull."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Aside from an amusing performance by Mark Wahlberg, I Heart Huckabees has little to recommend it unless you enjoy fantastically pretentious movies that eschew sense-making in favor of directorial indulgence."
1,What the Heck is going on,This film leaves me loss because where as most films have a least a point this one has none. I think the key to comedy is to be at least uh funny or in some way be at least satire This film makes no sense what so ever.Luckily the actors in this film are well established to go on to do other things but why in the world did they pick this film.
1,another sophmoric attempt at the MEANING OF LIFE,"The only laugh I got from this movie was the reviewer who said that you should remain in relative ignorance of the plotline. That is easily done - at the end of the movie you will still be in relative ignorance of the plotline. This little piece of film is another attempt at 'the meaning of life'. There IS a meaning in life but you have to crawl out of yourself to find it, so the zippered-up blanket the characters hide in is highly appropriate. I also got a laugh from the reviewer who couldn't give the movie a blanket recommendation. For the writers - you can't make a profound statement in a vacuum - you have to take your audience with you."
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"After sitting down & watching this film twice in order to ensure that my analysis made sense to me...it's clear that this films underlying theme is political and personal at the same time. Political in the sense that I Heart Huckabees is definitely taking a stab at political ideologues and their inability to see beyond their leanings. And personal due to the fact that it is individuals that ultimately make up any political faction, and it is up to that individual to avoid falling into the ideological trap.It's clear that at the end, Schwartzman & Wahlberg take a bit of both sides of the debate in order to determine their own boundaries of contentment. For anyone to try and go deeper than that analysis might miss the point, and not see the film for what it is, an attack on blind obedience & followership."
3,Lagging,"I <3 Huckabees is a lagging movie. Even with a superb cast, I felt bored at time and the story seems confusing and slow. It's like a Wes Anderson movie, but not as funny."
5,Consider it an IQ test.,"The Amazon ""Editorial"" review failed the test. This movie is brilliant. If you have any trace of an education, you'll get it. And you'll love it."
3,Half-hearted Huckabees,"In short I find this to be a popcorn version of what Charlie Kaufmann has been doing for the past 5 years in ""Eternal Sunshine"" and ""Being John Malkovich."" The performances seem a bit phoned-in at times, giving an overall half-baked quality to the film. It feels rushed. At other times it overreaches and then winds up feeling a bit like an American remake of a better European film. I kept thinking -- I've seen this somewhere before...Still it has its charm. The visuals are fun, but again, I thought ""Eternal Sunshine"" was better.Yes, the DVD is JAM-PACKED with great extras, almost too much to take in -- I mean the film isn't so good that I want to waste so much time watching almost two dozen deleted scenes or interviews.Fun philosophizing with BIG stars. Not great, but good. ***1/2"
1,(negative 3 stars) disgusting abuse of philosophy,"this is THE movie for pseudophilosophy/pop-philosophy; that is to say, it is THE movie for those too lazy to read or engage in any way in real philosophy, those more attracted to cutesy philosophy with instant gratification and no real meaning."
1,being bored,"Boring.Yeah, I guess I have to say more. But really, that's all this boils down to. Being bored. You wait for something interesting to happen amid all this pretentious ""if there meaning to life"" babble talking, but all hope is in vain. The French make films like this all the time, pondering the meaning of our existence, getting philosophical. They do it better, mostly because they do it a lot. In American hands it just seems strained and forced, and the choice of actors is just ill advised. The film makers are clearly grinning at their own ""we sure are clever"" work here, but I was very unimpressed."
3,I Heart Huckabees_____SO CONFUSED,"****NOT FOR CHILDREN*****Out standing movie. However it was a little confusing. All sohuld watch it if they want to better understand nothing. The movie tells the sotry of a person who is scared of a quincidence. He keeps on seeing the same Black Guy all over town. This leads him to the Extotensial Dectevied who spy on him trying to get him to understand the Universe. He meets his ""Other"" and they decide to persue another method. One that tells him to give up that the universe in nothingness. He eventialy follows himself and.... Havent seen the end Will have to rent it to finish this review."
1,"A lot of fill in the blanks, true or not.","Most LDS members either know of this or can easily find out about the wives of JS. This book takes liberties with putting the author's words in the mouths of these women, who wanted to strengthen the numbers of the Saints on earth and in the eternities. Most remarried. You can read about plural marriage at lds.org."
3,Good Read,"This is a different style of writing than I usually read, but full of great facts. I really feel bad for the poor pioneer women; they were extraordinary people to deal with all the crazy men. It is hard to verify his sources, but fortunately I had found most of the information previously in other books. This is a sort of collection of biographies on each wife. He did a great job of not duplicating events, which must have been a really hard job."
2,"Ok, but doesn't move much air","Got these fans to move hot air within my entertainment system. The units work ok and are quiet, but they really don't move much air. I am not happy with this item as it is not addressing the reason for purchase."
3,Tomb Raider,I have played almost all the tomb raider games. From the first through the chronicle. This game was very short. It only had 13 levels. Delivery was on time.
3,Scrabble but using Math,This game is hard for kids who are not totally into Math. It is set up just like scrabble only using numbers.
5,Fun and Educational for ALL ages!,"We bought this game as an educational tool for our home school. It is very versatile in that you can choose to do easy (just addition and/or subtraction) or more difficult (adding in multiplication, division, and fractions). Thus, it is adaptable for any age group (above 6yrs old). It is great for 1st grade through adults. It is exactly like Scrabble. My husband and I even have fun playing it, even though we bought it for the kids' use. I highly recommend it for any home!"
3,Good purchase,"It seemed less sturdy than I though when I bought it, but this stool has been a great help. I'm short and being able to adjust the angle is nice. Only cOmplaint is that the stops on the bottom that prevent sliding came off almost immediatly."
4,Does the job,"This works great--it slides a little on our rug but I just need to put something on the bottom so it's more skid-proof. It would be perfect otherwise. I LOVE that it's adjustable so it will be my daughter's step-stool for potty & brushing teeth when I""m no longer using it as a nursing foot stool. But I'm petite so this helps support my lower back. I didn't have it with my son and should have. Definitely recommend!"
3,Eve and Roarke in the Present!,"First of all, I am very much a fan of Nora Roberts. I always buy her books. I love J. D. Robb books and have read them all and wait for October to get the next one. ""Night Tales"" was a good book, but there were two stories (out the four) that strongly ""copied"" Eve and Roarke. The female in Nightshade had the characteristics and attitude of Eve, even down to the rolling of the shoulders! The male in Night Shadow was Roarke made over. It made me wonder if an author can be guilty of plagerizing from herself??? Normally every Nora Roberts book would get a ""5 star"" from me, but this really bothered me. Eve and Roarke are my favorites; Roarke especially is the ultimate! All in all, the first and the last stories were great and did stand well on their own. I have even bought the continuation in Night Shield, although I have not read it yet. If you don't read J. D. Robb books, you will absolutely love Night Tales."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is relevant to the designer/ developer and producer of many types of websites: educational, corporate and even ones of a more experimental nature.After having read Alan Cooper, Louis Rosenfeld and Steve Krug I wasn't sure I'd learn anything new about information design/ architecture from this book. I was wrong. It's clear that Garrett knows his subject inside out but just as important is the way that the book is structured. It's a pleasure to read.Another thing I appreciated was that his voice didn't get in the way of the information presented. Highly recommended."
3,More about teamwork than the user experience,"This is an abstract, conceptual book with very few concrete examples. As someone designing a website as a solo project, I didn't find it useful. I would recommend this book only if you're managing a large team and need a framework to coordinate your designers.I did enjoy the diagrams, which employ Garrett's unique (and sensible) style. You can find out more about this ""visual vocabulary for information architecture"" at Garrett's website."
2,Should have read the reviews first,"Yes it touches on points that affect the user experience but it is so disjointed and abstract to be almost a hindrance.Listen, the guy may have some good ideas and probably knows how to create an effective user-experience but this book should never have been written. You can't write an entire book on user experience based on a sketch you did in 1999."
4,I'm just a student...,"I've been a student of the War for over 40 years. Bought this book as background reading before traveling to visit some of the sites of the battles of the Western Front.The author seems to try to say the South lost because of poor leadership. And, he uses the Southern leadership at Fort Henry-Fort Donelson as his example. Nice to read good descriptions of a battle that has not received as much commentary as some of the more popular ones.The maps are not very good."
5,Only one I'll buy,"I've been gluten free for 4 years, and I have a son who has been gluten free for 9 years and another son who has been gluten free for 2 years (we're all celiac disease). This is the only all-purpose flour I'll buy. You can use it to convert any non-gluten free recipe you have and my non-celiac friends are surprised when I eat what I bring because they would never guess that it's gluten free. Other flours have made the product crumble, but not Beth's."
2,"Good Baking Mix, But Waste of Money","This is a good flour (white rice). But what you may not know is that it is also the cheapest available flour for baking gluten free. You can usually find it in bulk at big grocery stores for $0.60-1.20 per pound. The other listed ingredients: potato starch, tapioca starch, and guar gum can also be purchased in bulk here on Amazon.If you go to this extra effort, your $23 will go from 6 pounds of baking flour to 30."
2,Better than stock,"These sound okay when combined with other stock speakers, but overall are not good speakers. The highs are muffled and claps sound like cardboard. I'm not running any bass through these, and they still distort. However, they match the sound of my stock speakers in the back pretty well. The Kappas are WORLDS better, but don't necessarily sound good with other brands, like the Polk db series or my stock speakers, IMO."
1,"""BORING-VERY BORING""","Was looking forward to this but am very disappointed, especially with the last part. Don't waste your money it's just too much singing same type of songs about Rogers and why Tubb & Snow are there are beyond me, especially Tubb with his cigarette voice. Neither sound anything like Rogers, no yodeling at all. Maybe when they were younger they could yodel but those days were long past. looks like Bear Family is just trying to make another quick Buck."
5,Let this book sink into your spirit.,Murray reveals a path in life of yileding to God that takes us beyond our ability to submit and enters in God's ability in us. He captures a powerful aspect of the grace-filled life in these essays.
4,Works...,"Have used this several times. Only compliant is when running two dogs, you have to train them not to cross over. A little de-tangling required"
5,Great running tool,This is a very functional/useful leash that allows you to 'arm swing' during your walk/run with you dogs. This 'extra buddy' added a leash to my BUDDY SYSTEM that allows me to easily bring both of my dogs. It took a few days but the dogs do very well with the system and I love the quick release system to quickly re-position the dogs.
1,Only last 3 years,"The top chrome pieces rots away after three years. Not easy to find replacement. Need to buy an complete new kit rather than just the ""pump""."
2,who knew that soap was corrosive,"We've had our dispenser for about two years. The soap has somehow managed to eat away at the metal, and I've just had to order a replacement. I suppose we can try to find a milder handsoap (??), or else just keep it there for looks, since the holes are already drilled.It's hard to know whether to fault Moen for this, but it is, at least, surprising."
1,Huge disappointment!!,Simply put. Does not work at all. I paid 14.00 dollars for this at Walgreens. Have been trying it for a week on my back and ankle pain. I think blowing on your skin would give better results. Save your money and steer clear of this dud.
2,Not Well Written,"Coelho belongs in a high school creative writing class with this uncrafted chunk of a message on love and religion. Coelho, save me an hour of bored reading and just tell me once again that ""love is blahblahblah,"" with a few mentionings about god."
3,"Not one of Coelho's better books, but readable nonetheless","While reading the book, I thought Coelho spent too much time deliberately clouding the plot with his character's musings and rambling state of mind, but then I remembered that I was reading a translation of a Latin author's work -- it is exceedingly difficult to transmit the Latin mindset easily into English, as anyone who's read a work in Spanish or Portuguese followed by its English translation knows. When I have time, I'd like to read the novel in Spanish to see if it rings truer, although I don't know if the Portuguese-to-Spanish translation is any less difficult. I could learn Portuguese, I guess, but I'm too lazy.I can't say I came away from reading this book spiritually enriched, but I will confess to having had an unusual depth to my thoughts while reading it. While there may or may not have been a link, it's enough to get me to read another Coelho novel sometime in the future."
3,NOT FOR ME,"THIS WAS PRAISED BY A GRANDDAUGHTER. I'M 84, AND PROBABLY DIDN'T 'GET IT'. IT WAS WRITTEN IN AN UNUSUAL FIRST PERSON STYLE."
1,Awful.,"I really like Coelho's other novels, but this one was completely a waste of time. Nothing in the novel spoke to me, and the story line didn't make much sense. The ending blew chunks. Don't bother reading."
4,"Great CD, but buy the 2-in-1 live set instead","I love Red Knuckles and his gang. Great country swing music, great voices, wonderful tongue-in-cheek humor. All of these come through beautifully on this live set.-However-Do yourself (and your checkbook) a favor and get the ""Red Knuckles & Trailbalzers/Hot Rize Live"" CD instead of this one; it is a 2-for-1 album that contains the complete uncut Red Knuckles CD *plus* the full companion Hot Rize set from the same show(s), and all offered at exactly the same price as each individual album. Even if you prefer the country-swinging Red Knuckles alter-ego to the Hot Rize bluegrass sound, the Hot Rize album contains three additional Red Knuckles tracks that you would be missing from this CD. Not to mention that the Hot Rize set is remarkably strong as well."
3,A fairly good translation.,"This is a fairly good translation. At the end is an interesting essay Why did Henry David Thoreau take the Bhagavad Gita to Walden Pond? Then there is a useful glossary. One thing lacking is an index. I would recommend buying instead a translation with an index, like Schweig's or Easwaran's. One strange thing about Miller's translation is all the sexism, like 'learned men', 'undiscerning men', 'wise men' etc., which is surprising for a woman translator. It is true that Sanskrit there has masculine nouns, but both sexes are meant. The reason is that in Sanskrit every noun has to be assigned a gender, and masculine is the default even when both sexes are meant, like in Spanish, German etc."
4,Very Original,Honestly I picked this book out of the library due to the cute picture on the cover (plastic cow). I read the back and it sounded fun enough so I read it. I couldn't get over what was in this book. The imagination the author has is incredible. I have told many of my friends about it and they want to read it just to see if I'm telling the truth. I really liked the book once I got passed the whole notion that it didn't make a lot of sense but it was highly amusing. I will never look at cows and power rangers the same again. Who knew brain surgery required such few tools.....?
3,Clock is always off,"I mainly bought this because it's not Teflon and it has a timer so I can set it and forget. It's now sitting in storage because the clock runs too fast and is always off. It's a great rice cooker besides this one issue, but I'm a busy person and I need to rely on the clock to be right."
5,Happy with the cooker,"Just made white rice for the first time in vitaclay, results were fantastic. I usually use water level about 1 1/2 inches above the level of rice, which is my traditional learning. ( I measure with middle finger). Waiting to try the other recipes.Only down side is that you have to wait till the cooker to get cool for the next batch of rice, which I don't mind at this stage. Also I had to get a transformer for 110v.I wish they post more videos with the initial stages of setting the cooker and at this syptage wondering how to replace the inbuilt battery (display)After 2 weeks (29/3/12) I have only good results. No tried anything other than white ans brown rice ans with my own measurement of water level, each time rice came up perfectly. My husband thinks the rice tastes better than previous ordinay rice cookers!"
3,Viatclay 8-Cup review,"PROs:- easy to clean and use- both brown and white rice are cooked perfectly.- overall design and look is sleek- rice retains its taste and texture even after a few daysCONs:- size, occupies to much space- `rice cooking` indicator light stopped working after 2 weeks- cooking time is a little bit longer than regular rice cookers- claypot should be handled with care as it might breakOverall I would recommend this product for its health benefits and quality of cooked rice."
1,internal problem and poor service from manufacturer,I bought this cooker and keep using it daily. It is a good cooker but has problem on the clock. It never has the right time even you correct it frequently. The big problem and risk - after using it around 6 months E1 error code comes out on every use. As per the instruction manual that is internal and need to call for assistance. I email and call to the warranty center in CA but not get any prompt reply. Finally talked to them and told me that may be too much water added. I do what they has told me and same error pop up every time. Again I inform them but so far no reply. I also find out this cooker doesn't has an UL listed or approval. Is this safe to use?
4,none,"It looks used , but it works fine. Best of all, it is a lot cheaper than local supplier. Still, it is a good purchase foe me."
2,A large disappointment as a conclusion,"Though book one was a griping tale the follow-up by Vornhort was disappointing. The enemy was an interesting choice, well thought out, and presented new challenges developed from Star Trek lore. The mystery of book one was lost and though the story telling was masterful, the climax and resolution were not only much too quick, but below the level of energy and enthusiasm you felt throughout the story. Almost as if Vornhort tied some pieces together to meet a deadline, not to complete what had promised to be one of the better Star Trek stories.An intriguing adventure that ultimately went no where..."
4,I liked this book.,"I used to read this and 'Dynamite Book of Ghosts and Haunted Houses' all the time, as a child. I'd love to read it again."
1,Nice if it didn't stop working!!!!11,"Used it for maybe two weeks and then it stooped working, sent it back and now I hope to get a refund back soon!"
1,Interference on every frequency,"I bought this based on the 2 reviews already published here. I live in a relatively rural area, but even so I couldn't get a decent signal with this product. It covers a wide range of frequencies and is very easy and convenient to use, but my music came through full of static even on frequenies that are nowhere near those of broadcast radio stations. I ended up returning this piece of junk and buying and installing a car stereo with an aux input--the only reliable way to get MP3 player tunes to play through your car receiver."
1,After ffects Applying After effects,"Save your money on this book unless you own the""Production Bundle"" of After effects because a lot ofthe projects requjire it and you are not told in theintro that you need it. This book is a waste of moneyfor the beginner"
1,Beginners only,"If you don't know any After Effects this may be a good buy. Otherwise don't waste your time.I am hardly an AE guru but i found little in this book that i didn't alreay know from having gone through Adobe's Classroom in a Book and then trying to imitate station ID's and movie titles on my own.The best learning tool for AE? Try to get a copy of Imaginary Forces' reel. They're the motion graphics company behind Seven, Hollow Man (terrible movie, burly titles) and more. Watch it over and over and see how much of it you can do yourself."
1,the worst after-effects book i read so far,"This book has a large quantity of tutorials but no real quality. I was very disappointed when i got it. Not only are the tutorials very basic but also badly designed. When you look at the pictures and the example-movies of the final results it doesn't really make you want to even read how it was done (with a bit of experience with After Effects you'll already know it anyway).A lot of the free goodies that were supposed to be on the second CD are missing.Don't waste your money on this one. Instead I recommend the books ""Creating Motion Graphics with After Effects"" and ""After Effects in production"" by Chris and Trish Meyer as well as the ""Classroom in a book""-books for version 4 and 5."
5,"Worked as expected, fun to have for the older games","Bought this for my teenage son so we could download some of the older games that we used to play on the N64. Well worth the investment, now we can play Legend of Zelda and other games on our wii."
3,Nintendo Wavebird GameCube controller may be a better buy,"The Nintendo Wii Classic Controller is intended for use with the Wii Virtual Console. Consider purchasing a Wii Classic Controller if you intend to play Virtual Console games only, otherwise consider buying a Nintendo Wavebird GameCube controller for the ability to (wirelessly) play both Virtual Console games and Nintendo GameCube games.Although the Wii Classic Controller is smaller and lighter (and has slightly different control stick and button layouts) than any Nintendo GameCube controller, the Wii Classic controller cannot be used to play any GameCube titles, and there are currently no Wii-specific titles that require a Wii Classic Controller. By contrast, Nintendo GameCube controllers may be used for all GameCube titles and currently all Wii Virtual Console titles.Although the Wii Classic Controller has a slot that allows for an underneath clip attachment, no current Wii controller or accessory utilizes this slot."
2,One benefit but big downside,"Why do I have this controller that will not work on Nintendo Gamecube games that I want to play on my Wii? The only benefit this offers is that it plugs into your Wii-mote and then becomes semi-wireless (still killing your batteries). Do yourself a favor and spend the same $20 on a wireless Gamecube controller. You can still play the virtual console games, plus the Gamecube discs, and not have a remote connected 3 feet away."
3,To adddress the other review here,"It's not in ANY way spelled out or obvious, but this controller connects to the Wiimote. So it kinda IS wireless. Had I known, I would have spend $20 for this, rather than $15 for the GC controller.So, three stars for being unclear."
5,Wii Classic Controller - Awesome for Gamers,"This controller is great if you want to play classic games. But sure is hard to find, I believe it is sold out everywhere and not expected in stores until January. You absolutely need this controller to play the classic games or for Wii point cards. Plugs into the Wii remote for wireless access, great controller and concept. So much better than trying to use a GameCube controller."
5,tratar de estar mejor,"yo solo buscaba esta cancion ""tratar de estar mejor"" y encontre una gran colleccion. muy feliz por esta compra. si eres fan de diego esta disco no puede faltar en tu colleccion."
1,Coby Broken Out of Box,"Can no longer trust any off brand products to work. Made in China means could be broken as soon as you open the box. If you can get one days use out of the product, consider yourself lucky. Avoid Coby no matter what the price. Not even worth it for free."
1,"Bad, Very Very Bad","Long, boring, and never came to any sort of conclusion. Every time the story gave you a hint that something scary or creepy was going to happen, it fell on its face and kept dragging the love story out.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Funny and Captivating,"This is a fantastic first attempt by a talented new writer. Cristina's voice is clear, funny, smart and incredibly entertaining. In joining her in her search to find Francis or more importantly, to find herself, I often found myself wandering through my own past and my own self-discovery. Thank you for reminding us about the joy, pain and laughter of each day and each relationship in our lives. I look forward to seeing more from this witty and wonderful new novelist."
3,sanctuary,This book started off very well with the death of a woman and her unborn child and if the book had continued in the solving of this situation and had then went on to the moral value of the story about how to live your life it would have been great but it just stopped and then started on something completely unrelated and it took to the end of the book to hook up the two parts and to me it just took away from the story.
3,Classic but poor style and lack of objectivity,"This book is not just a history of the mob but is part of that history, as Tukus was a prosecutor of the first big cases against the mob. As a prosecutor of the criminals Tukus is hardly objective in his views of them, their lives and so forth. Their horrific deeds speak for themselves but he feels the need to condemn them often, as if preaching to the jury. The stlye is overwhelmed by the 50s journalistic background of the co-author, and I like others find it annoying in its excess of adjectives.Nevertheless, if you want to know the subject, this is a must read. And with all its flaws, it is still really fun."
1,Don't waste your time!!!!!,"Chicken Run is the worst game I have ever played. The graphcs are good, but the only veiw you can have is above the character. If you go out in the open the dogs will be on you very quickly which makes it hard to complete your missions. Don't waste your money or time on this game."
4,Nice Book,"This is a nice book. I like Teresa Wentzler designs and decided to get this on a whim. I'm not disappointed. The designs are not too bad. The dragons are beautiful. I'm not thrilled with the mermaids and the nautical themes, but the rest of the book is nice."
3,El ultimo disco,"Cuarto y ultimo disco de Caifanes, producido por Greg Ladanyi y con un sonido mas cercano al grunge que al afro - rock que habia caracterizado las anteriores producciones del grupo: El Diablito (1990) y El Silencio (1992). Tras la salida de Sabo Romo y Diego Herrera, Caifanes graba El Nervio del Volcan con la participacion de musicos como Federico Fong (La Barranca) y Yanni Zaragoza.Este album incluye los exitos: ""Afuera"" y ""Aqui No Es Asi"", aunque tambien hay piezas interesantes como ""La Llorona"" y ""Miedo"", donde Marcovich muestra su habilidad al tocar el violin electrico. Quiza sea el disco mejor producido de Caifanes, sin embargo, le hace falta la magia de discos como El Silencio.Canciones recomendadas: Afuera, Ayer Me Dijo Un Ave, Avientame."
4,Taxi Dancer,"A Vietnam tale written by someone that was there. As a Air Force Officer serving in the Thai theatre during the mid 60's when it was a war and a circus, when the politicans back in Washington called the shots and the guy at the trigger was just a necessary evil. Having been there, during those times, his story rings so, so true. It's a good tale, well written, that gives the reader a flashback to those times where the protestors often had more impact on the war than the participants did. Good book-- been there-- did that!"
3,The cruel years,"When this series started, it was a fun look at a quirky family whose members were sometimes crazy but always lovable. By Season 7, Doug had turned into a selfish little boy and Carrie was just as selfish, but also cruel. In this season, it doesn't seem like they care for each other anymore, and the viewer is left to wonder why they even live in the same house. As a family unit, they were no longer believable. In real life, Kevin James had lost weight and Leah Remini was still recovering from pregnancy. But on the show, Carrie relentlessly criticizes Doug for being fat. The writers needed to recognize reality, move on, or quit. We did enjoy the development of supporting characters, but as far as Doug and Carrie's marriage is concerned, it just isn't working anymore."
4,"Good Product, Bad Adaptor","Pros: I purchased the AirStation for use with a desktop computer located in a bad area for wireless reception. The 9 foot cable allowed the AirStation to be situated in an area with less interference. The high gain and directional capabilities also improved the reception. Finally, the attractive appearance of the AirStation made it ideal for use in a highly visible area.Cons: The AirStation comes with an ""MC to RP-TNC"" adaptor which does NOT mate with the wireless card in my desktop. To make the connection, you need to purchase the ""Buffalo Tech AIRSTATION OPTIONAL ANTENNA ( WLE-RMC )"" adaptor. The name used at Amazon implies that it's an antenna; however, it's actually the adaptor needed to make the connection. This adaptor should have been included with the AirStation. At the very least, the customer should be warned that an additional adaptor may be needed."
5,Love can overcome time,"I got lost in the pages of In My Next Life. Michal Sands does a great job re-creating times long gone through the memories of his main character, Mark Nevon. And what a thrilling chase he creates when Mark finds out that his soul mate lives again in a young woman he has recently met. A great conflict is produced when Mark has to struggle between his growing love...and concern... for his soulmate and his faltering marriage. Very true to life. And the conversations throughout are realistic and flowing. I loved the ending. It makes me hope for true love, and it makes me believe there is a reason for our soul mates, even if we haven't realized we've met them yet."
4,Looks good.,"Needed something different from the old style I'd inherited from Mom. Seems to be working out great, I'd recommend this item."
4,Ateco French Rolling Pin,This is just right for me because I have to keep my hands open to use it due to arthritis. It rolls smoothly and easily.
5,Worth it,This is a great rolling pin. I like the tapered shape and it's well-balanced. I gave my other two rolling pins away after getting this one because it's all I ever use anymore. When I need a rolling pin I automatically reach for this one. The price is not bad either. If you want to upgrade or just add another to your collection this is a good one to get.
4,It is nice,This is just as you would imagine a plain wooden pin. But it is made out of decent wood and is light weight. Overall I am happy with product.
4,Great for pasta,This pin was great for use in rolling fresh pasta dough. The price was right for the quality of pin received. I would recommend this pin.
3,Costume Scarf,"Well, for the price of this ""Costume Scarf"" - don't expect the material to be of any real quality -- it truly is good for kids ""one-time"" use and quite ""disposable"" -- the material is very flimsy -- although the colors are nice & vibrant --- I'm glad the product description is not misleading -- and for the price, you can't beat it. BUT if you're looking for a ""Real Scarf"" material - with some weight & substance, look elsewhere, or expect to pay more. Just to give you an idea, the scarf came delivered to me, U.S. Mail, in a Flat 9"" x 11"" envelope.........."
1,The complaints are real,"I bought a Gryffindor scarf and tie, both made by Rubies. The colors do not match between the two products -- not even close. The tie has a decently accurate color per what you see in the movies. The scarf is a very dark purple and dark/muddy orange. It doesn't look like the product photo and I'm sad to see Warner Brothers authorized this level of quality in one of its products. If I'd seen this scarf in person, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,A great set,"This is a great movie pack, I'd highly recommend for anyone. The Crawling Hand threw me a little, because it was such an early episode. Tom Servo's voice was different (different actor), there was no TV's Frank, but the humor was still the same (""No zombies. No zombies allowed."") Meanwhile, the Wild Wild World Of Batwoman had no point and went nowhere fast. Towards the end, Servo finally yells out, ""END!!! END!!!"" Also has great lines like, ""That's 40 pounds of butt in 30 pound butt-capacity pants."" And The Beginning of the End has all sorts of great references and lines, ""HEY FRAAANK!"" Definitely a worthwhile buy."
5,Demystifing and comforting,"""The Truth About..."" makes clear how many live in pain and just how pervasive the matter is. In short, Rosenfeld's work clearly and concisely explains the issues while demystifying a series of complex problems.While there are many philosophical and religious dimensions involved, it's equally amazing to hear how so many personal and divergent points of view all lead to the same bottom line: that none of us should ever have to suffer because of someone's hang-up about prescription drugs or about pain as a character builder.If ""The Truth..."" does nothing else but shed light while comforting those who suffer in the dark without knowledge, then undoubtedly hundred of thousands, or perhaps even millions of untold sufferers will be better for it."
2,"Interesting, but not useful","If you're looking for useful advice in dealing with pain this is not the book for you. This is the first reading I've done on this subject, and I was hoping for some practical advice and specific pain-coping strategies rather than a lot of talk about why chronic pain is generally undertreated by the medical profession. I read this book and I still don't know what to do about my pain."
5,LOVE this bag!!,"I purchased this bag as a case for my 15.6 inch Dell Studio 15. It fits fine and still has plenty of room to hold other necessities. Also, I love all the pockets and pouches! I am thoroughly pleased with this item."
2,Zippers broke after 1 day,"I couldn't use this bag - without any effort, the zipper broke! First, one of the 2 main zippers came off, so I just used the other one; later, the zipper split open on both sides and wouldn't close as I zipped back and forth. I'm waiting for a replacement from Belkin - hopefully they improved the zipper quality.It just makes me mad that we've known how to make zippers that actually work great for over 100 years, and Belkin would put a zipper like this on their bag!I am adding a star because the bag itself would have been great! I love that it's slim, good looking, and has great organized compartments. The soft lined area where the laptop slides in also just feels good."
4,"Nice, Sleek","very tight fit in the bag but it does zip close and the bag is very sleek. I just need this bag to protect my laptop and maybe carry a notebook and pen in. This is not much room for anything else. I think I can probably fit my power charger in the bag with my laptop but I have not tried yet. Also, know that the color of the bag is lighter in real life than it is in the photo. In the photo, the chocolate brown almost looks black, but in person the bag is definitely brown and pale blue. I wish this bag was made just a couple inches longer to better accommodate 17"" laptops - but it is probably a really great fit for anything less than 17""."
5,Great bag!,"Purchased this laptop sling bag for a recent two-week trip around Italy. It was fantastic. Compact, yet holds a lot, it was extremely comfortable to carry and also looked good. Got tons of compliments from fellow travellers everywhere I carried it. And, I even used it when I wasn't carrying my laptop to store purchases in and other stuff."
4,Quality,"All I can say is QUALITY! Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. Has plenty of pockets and compartments for your stuff. Pretty durable as well. My laptop fits nice and snug. Double plus because its my favorite colors. And someone always gives positive comments about it. Its worth it and so are you."
2,"Good looking bag, but makes carrying a laptop painful","I was initially delighted with this bag but after trying to carry around my macbook in it, my feelings changed. I'm a thin and short woman and I think that the sling design does not have such a person in mind. The bag felt clunky and odd on my back (kind of like an ill-fitting vest perhaps) and I felt the need to readjust it a lot. It is also a pretty painful experience if you have to walk more than like 2 blocks or so. All the weight of my computer seemingly rested on my one shoulder. Besides all that, I found that there was plenty of space for the computer plus maybe a couple of legal pads and I liked how there were tons of crazy pockets. It looks pretty cool, but I would definitely go with the backpack version of this bag instead."
5,"It is a laptop bag, not a backpack","Packed with a 14.1"" Lenovo T61, its power adapter and cord, a mouse, assorted wires, pens and documents, this bag still manages to stay very light. The sling design makes it very easy and comfortable to carry. The laptop compartment is well padded and reasonably separated. There is a small padded pillow with Velcro attachments that may be used to secure the laptop from the top. The zippers are a bit stiff but they look nice. The front pocket on the strap is a very good idea that is not so well implemented; it is very slim, so few things will fit in it (a passport will stick out by 20% for example).The red color on main product picture is wrong; the actual color is not red at all, it's more maroon than red.This bag is designed to carry a laptop and a few items with it. Do not expect to be able to pack it full of stuff. A very well designed and made bag; there were no loose threads or anything else out of the ordinary in the one I got.Very happy with the purchase."
5,Fantastic,"This is a great book and for those who like to try and figure out who did it you can guess until almost the very end, with little clues here and there, if you get them. I thought it was written well and am looking forward to reading another book of hers."
1,Problems,"I ordered two security lights for my new house and had an electrician install them.We can not get them to work right even when all of the settings are in the correct mode.The lights come on in a low dim mode as if on a dimmer switch, when not motion active. When motion acitve, they come on, and go off in a timed manner from the settings, and automatically come on again in a dim dimmmer type of mode and will stay on all night unless the power is cut.We have un-istalled, re-installed, tried moving the sensor, moving the light sockets and still can not get them to work right. Currently they both have power cut to them and are off and obviuosly not working at this time.It is possible that the electrician and I have done something wrong, but I doubt it, we used the instruction pamphlet from the factory, and tried several time to right it, but no luck so far.My last step will be to try another electrician and if nothing happens I will take them down."
4,BETTY OVER SHADOWS HARRY,"Betty Grable Queen of Technicolor sings here with then husband Harry James, Betty was always the bigger star and it shows."
3,"Wow, what a letdown","This is one of the rare books that my art college actually required me to purchase for a Typography class. The design of this book is poor and very dated. Just take a look at the cover. The first chapter offers a timeline which is interesting in concept--it features a brief history of lettering and type, and adds images of other significant events happening at the same time. But the timeline design forces you to jump back and forth from images to text and the grid layout forces the image placement to be so inconsistent that you give up trying to find the corresponding text. The rest of the book provides interesting and useful information for the type neophyte, but again, its WAY too dated to be a required textbook. I'm sorry I bought this book."
2,bored to tears,I made the mistake of paying to see this. I usually like to watch cutie O'Connell but wow boring movie. You would think with special effects & all the digital things they have today maybe they could hide a bad story line. Not so! Really boring.
1,"Holy Smokes, Batman! This film is a BUST!","Joel Schumacher, a painfully average director with a dubious track record (St. Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, A Time to Kill, and Flawless), siphons the dark edge Tim Burton brought to the first two Batman films. While the first two movies recall the darkness of the original comic book, Shumacher's Batman films recall the campiness of the 1966 TV series, and that's not a good thing. In addition to the wooden performances, ""Batman and Robin"" is jam-packed with an overly busy plot. There was so much going on in this movie I went dizzy. It takes no psychic to figure where this review is heading: ""Batman and Robin"" is a bloated mess that should be avoided."
1,"Bad,Bad,Bad","This was a very bad movie to sit through.The cast does terriblejobs at playing their roles,and the script ...The action isslow,and fake.This movie could've been alot better If they workedon it."
2,Please bring back Tim Burton and Michael Keaton!,"I haved loved Batman ever since I saw it when I was 7. The Burton/Keaton Batmans were terrific because they were so dark, but Batman Forever wasn't too bad. This installment was very disappointing. The script was terrible, to say the least, and there were so many useless subplots(the motorcycle race for example). Clooney as Batman was pretty good but Keaton is the best. I liked Clooney a lot better that Kilmer. The villans were terrible and they should not let supermodels act(Elle mcpherson). The sidekicks were alright, but Batgirl's character should've been developed more. This movie is a letdown so if you really want a good Batman movie, watch the first two."
3,Mouseboy,"This movie wasn't one of the best movies I've ever seen. It wasn't as good as the other batman movies, but I did like the cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a really good guy for the part of Mr.Freeze, but George Clooney wasn't the best actor for batman. They should have chosen someone else. Overall this movie was three stars because it wasn't as good as the others."
1,Batman and Robin,This movie stunk. I can't believe they actually made this crap. I enjoyed the other three films in the series. Very disappointing and a big let down!!!
4,The most underrated movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is not as bad as some people think!This is pretty good movie that is SO much better than Batman Returns,which is the WORST Batman movie EVER made!Batman and Robin is pretty enjoyable and try to look past its flaws.4 stars and I am not being generous!Great Movie!"
3,Not so bad,"While far from being any sort of masterpiece (and a step down from Forever), this is still not such a terrible movie as some people find it. The amount of special effects stuffed into this movie is probably the most ridiculously gigantic I have ever seen in my entire life - but still, the story is quite original and although it has some rough edges, the heartfelt sentimentality of certain scenes, so unusual in this sort of action movies, really redeemed the many flaws of the movie."
1,"Holy Bad Movie, Batman!","Don't count me wrong. I am a huge Batman fan and I admire the first good Batman film and the even better Batman Returns. But this film sucks. The atmosphere is lighthearted and peppy, the action in hokey, the performances are BAD, even by action-movie standards (when Oscar performances are not required), and the music score is annoying. On the positive side, the sound and picture are perfect, but who needs them when the film is bad? END"
2,Useless episode....,"BATMAN AND ROBIN does everything that Tim Burton tried to avoid when he brought Batman back inside from the cold - it is campy, cartoonish and plain daft.This movie seems a remake of the old Adam West batman episodes. The huge budget is wasted on giant set pieces that LOOK like giant set pieces, rather than a vast open city seen in the first Batman movie and the new re-boot movie.All the villains are daft and seem unthreatening, and Clooney seems bored.Camp isn't the word, the whole thing looks like one of Elton John's birthday parties."
3,My First Batman,"Batman and Robin is the first live-action batman movie I can remember watching as a kid. Mind you, I was only five years old at the time and I found it incredibly awesome and it caused me to fall in love with Robin the Boy Wonder's character. I seemed to watch all the batman movies out of sequence. It wasn't until recently that I saw Batman Returns with Val Kilmer. Sad, I realize. While this movie isn't one of the best Batman movies out there, it's certainly the one of the most memorable in my mind. Now when I watch it as an eighteen year old, I can see the mass flaws in the editing and production of this movie. But boy do I love watching Chris O'Donnell in his spandex Robin suit. He is still my favorite Boy Wonder. :] Even if he doesn't like to claim this role."
1,This Movie should be called 'How To Insult Batman Fans'.,"This movie is a slap in the face for true Batman fans, and the intellegent movie goer alike. As a Batman fan, There is no movie I hate more than this one. Avoid like the plague. This movie is Batman's ""Kryptonite"". This Movie has done more to destroy Batman than The Joker has. This movie makes 'Pluto Nash' look like GLADIATOR. This movie makes babies cry. This movie couldn't stand up to a power rangers episode. Independent research has shown that this movie can cause depression. This Movie should come with a pooper-scooper. This movie killed Clooney's career... Wait, NO, CLOONEY killed Clooney's career. OK I'm done."
1,"It is supposed to be the Dark Knight, not Rainbow Bright...","If Joel Schumacher directs one more of these films, I am going to hang myself. Get Burton, or somebody else who won't turn Batman movies into a travesty. He has probably never read the comic book. What was with all the bright colors. It is the DARK KNIGHT, not Rainbow Bright. He single handedly destroyed what Tim Burton had done for the first two films. If Joel Schumacher makes another one, and it sucks as bad as the last two, then I think all the fans of the dark knight should file a lawsuit against the studio and Joel Schumacher for wasting 2+ hours of their lives that they will never see again."
3,But it's George Clooney!,"It's not the best Batman and Robin movie, but George Clooney is easy on the eyes!"
2,Uma saves it from being a total loss,"This film is a complete waste of time, energy and money. On that note the only saving grace is the uberfab Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. She really camped it up and had a blast toying with the men. The rest are all but a joke. Clooney is ok, but such a let down from Val Kilmer (who really seemed to get it). Chris O'Donnell is good, but relys too much on whining. Alicia Silverstone is just plain fat and ugly. Hello! Batgirl wears a cowl, not an eye mask! Schwarznegger was PATHETIC! The man is not an actor, he is a personality. The whole film was nothing but cheap one-liners and you can pretty much just skip the last 30 minutes (it is ridiculous). The best scene however is the infamous ""gorilla striptease"" with Poison Ivy at the ball. That scene literally had me standing in the aisle clapping with glee!"
1,A crime against art!,"This movie is a disgrace to Batman. I tried to watch this a while ago because I hadn't seen it in years and I couldn't do it. I could not make it to the end. There already is a cheesy and lame Batman movie by Adam West. Why waste some great characters like Bane and Mr. Freeze in such a terrible movie. Although there are many disappointments, Bane is the biggest for me. He was this incredibly strong and ruthless crime lord who broke the Batman. In this movie he can't even talk much less fight effectively. Plus, he gets defeated by Robin, very stupid. Batgirl is pretty useless too. Not the right origin and she's just really annoying. It would be better if her part was just used to take up time, at least we'd know they didn't try. Bruce Wayne is alright, but you take all this other stuff and throw it in with some ice skating, a terrible script and bad Batman, you got Batman and Robin."
1,Plain Bad,"In short, this movie has a very bad script (if you can call it a script) and terrible acting. This is the worst Batman movie there is and one worse can never be made. If you buy the DVD, you will regret it."
1,Batman Down the Tube,Adam West would've done better than George Clooney at his old age. Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy were the worst villains ever. Robin needs to have his wings clipped. Warner Bros. needs to put this movie in the 'cooler' and keep it there 'forever'. AHHH!
2,What went wrong? Anyone?,"I have been a Batman fan ever since the great days of Adam West. I just don't understand how something so great for so long, can go so wrong so fast.This film is prim example of a huge movie franchise hitting rock bottom. Batman & Robin has it's moments, very few, that are good. This movie just seemed to flashy. The dialogue is horrible, filled with cheesy on liners. I pity the writers. George Clooney, who I love, is not to blame for this flop. If he had known what he knows now about Batman & Robin, when he got that phone call asking...wanna be the next Batman?...he wouldn't have taken the role. I don't know who to blame this disaster on. If they ever make another Batman flick, god help them, I hope they remember the last Batman."
1,It sucked. Bad.,"I still haven't accepted the necessity of Robin's existence, as played by Chris O'Donnel. I had high hopes for this one, hopes that they would take what was good about FOREVER, drop the bad, and actually succeed in making a good Batman film, but the opposite happened. The sound is impressive. And George Clooney, I like, it isn't his fault. It's Akiva Goldsman. His script sucks unbelievably. And I used to like him. This is one of the worst scripts ever filmed. It is just plain bad."
2,Better luck next time.,"About as interesting as watching Alfred scrubbing floors at Wayne manor for two hours. Maybe not as horrible as everyone thinks, but certainly a huge disappointment when compared to Mr. Tim Burton's darker Batman movies. I even enjoy watching the animated Batman movie ""Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero"" more than ""Batman and Robin."" My advice (besides convincing Burton to return) is to thin out the cast a little. There are just way too many people in Batman movies these days. Ditch the perky sidekicks and maybe focus on just one villian. In the end, ""Batman and Robin"" (...and Ah-nuld, and Uma and ""Cher-the girl wonder"") is just another bloated Hollywood production, created to make people like me mad that they spent the cash to see it."
1,"""Batman & Robin"" fight a series of one-liners.","""Batman & Robin,"" starring George Clooney, the new Bruce Wayne AKA Batman. Chris O'Donnell returns as Robin, the Boy Wonder. George Clooney isn't the reason the film had a negative impact, he did great as both Batman and Mr. Wayne. The lines, however, is a different story. Line after line comes a one-liner, and one of the most irritating is Mr. Freeze's line ""All right, everyone, chill."" It's funny at first, but then he carries it on and on at everyone he freezes. Mr. Freeze's lines, in my opinion, is what caused the bomb to go off. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy thought as a villainess she could make herself a queen of a charity ball. The movie's story is half bad because the audience knows what is going on already. Alfred Pennyworth suffers ""McGregor's Syndrome"" which would only make the movie more confusing. It is also the disease that changes Mr. Freeze. This movie was just irritating."
1,So bad I could cry,"This is the one film in the world where I actually feel sorry for the people who like it. I am serious. That's not sarcasm.You have to be a total outcast to enjoy this film, with horrible taste."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie of all time,"The true tragedy of Batman & Robin is, unlike the campy '60s TV Batman, this movie doesn't realize how bad it is. If you're going to make a horrible movie, at least go all the way and acknowledge that it's horrible. Instead, we get a movie that tries to take itself seriously despite the most outlandishly bad writing, acting, costumes, set design, action sequences... the list goes on and on. Right in the first five minutes you get a clue as to how bad the movie you're about to see is:Batman is driving through Gotham City in his light-up blue neon Batmobile when he gets a call from Commissioner Gordon: ""Batman, there's a new villain in town. He's calling himself Mr. Freeze.""A high-school freshman could write better expositional dialogue than that. And it only gets worse from there. If you want an example of just how bad movies can get, then watch Batman & Robin. Otherwise stay far, far away."
1,Stay away from this plaig.,"I got sick twice while watching this junk.How did It make 109 million dollars at the movies?I heard It did terrible In videosales,and made very little money.That should explain why this Is a very bad movie that has been voted as one of the worst blockbusters ever made.The script Is terrible,and the acting is really bad.Read a book,watch Tomb Raider,go see T2,but stay away from this movie."
1,Batgirl? As Alfred's niece!!! So laughable.,Didn't Shumacher care that a lot of real Batman fans would notice this obvious change? For future Batman movies (can't wait for summer 2005!)...WB should ignore BOTH Clooney's portray of Batman and the existence of Batgirl in those movies.
2,Worst of the Batman films,"Akiva Goldsman has written some really good screenplays.... This is not one of them. The dialog was trite and derivative. Some of the worst one-liners given to Schwarzenegger (yes worse than the ones he used in all his other films including Total Recall and Running Man).Joel Schumacher's direction was.... well. Let's be honest. There was no direction. But that's OK because there were no actor's on set to direct. They all faxed in their performances (which would explain why they were all so flat).The set (especially the bizarre gargantuan statues that seem out of place), the nippled batsuits, and the neon everywhere - well lets just say that it wasn't the Batman I knew.It was like no one cared about this film while making it. As a result, the audience doesn't care either.I give it 2 stars because kids under 12 seem to like it. At least those who have never heard of Batman before."
2,"Loud, Trashy, Pointless Eye-Candy.","Michael Keaton an AWFUL Batman? Oh please..! Some people obviously don't know ANYTHING about good acting. Sure, Keaton is not 6 foot 2 inches at 225 pounds, but look into his eyes... Besides, have you seen how he's buffed up these days? His physique is certainly almost there compared to the comic Batman. George Clooney is okay as Wayne/Batman, but that's all he'll ever be: okay. Still, if he'd had a really good script, it's interesting to think how he might have been. That's all I can say about this film. The title of my review says it all, really."
3,Batman & Robin,"This movie isn't totally bad, but it is the worst of the series. I liked the way in the first two Gotham was always dark and mysterious, but here it's too colorfull, and the characters and setting seem sort of like the comic book silliness of the 60's. I loved the way the first two were serious, and they were mature adult films. Batman Forever was good, and it fit well. This one had dull dialoge, and parts of it were unrealistic. This is a movie more for kids ages 5-12. The third one was good, and you would wanna be 7+ to see it. The first two are appropraite for the age group of 13+. But the movie wasn't a total loss. But next time, bring back Tim Burton!"
1,Unnecessary return to the 60's,"Visually entertaining and stylistic. That's about the only good comments that could be forwarded to this, the worst Batman entry in the franchise. This includes the entry from the 60's starring Adam West and Burt Ward. As a huge batfan, i awaited this entry eagerly, if for nothing else than we would get to see Batgirl on screen for the first time in near 30 years. Unfortunately, the result was lacking, the tone too camp and the plot filled with holes you could park three batwings in. George Cloney deserved a better script for his first outing, being the first actor assigned the role who looked the part of Bruce Wayne. Chris O'Donnell played to a part that was too young for him, the tantrums making better sense if he had been the age of the real Robin at the time and Alicia Silverstone....i cant even begin to describe the nausea i get watching her ruin one of my favourite characters. Avoid if you can, unless you need to have the entire set."
1,this movie is awsome !!!!!,yeah u heard me awsome there was no plot no acting.it has batman cracking jokes and being incredibley campy! i mean it was an excellent idea to have a comedy about a man who sees his parents murdered before his eyes at age seven and then goes on a quest to avenge them inorder to relieve his pain! oh before i go here's some of the cool moments in the film(more sarcasm and SPOILERS !!!! ahead)1-bane the strongest and most intelligent of batmans foes is reduced to a dumb sidekick who gets killed by batgirl and robin!by pulling a tube from his head2-barbara gordon is changed to barbra wilson !!!!3-all the suits have nipples4-the film was infact a commercial 4 toys and even took direction from mcdonalds !!!!!5-the film is exactley like a dumbed down batman forever except with different characters !!!6-george clooney has a girlfriend for no apparent reason except to have elle mcferson in the film !!!
4,"War, Inc.","It has been compared to ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" and with some good reason. Although they are distinctly different movies they have similar themes of an assassin that isn't happy with his work. Once again a female gives him some distraction from his mundane work of illiminating threats to his government, no matter how ridiculous. I'm a fan of Cusack and his sister anyway but I was not disappointed in the least in the action and comedy in this movie. If you can't draw any parallels to current world events and political blunders you aren't getting it. I recommend it. If you enjoyed this catch ""Con Air"".CA Luster"
1,Waste of time,"I have in the past really enjoyed John Cusack, but this movie was so vapid. The attempts at humor were predictable and droll, and the characters were just a reflection of John Cusack's image of them - very stereotypical. Obviously, not much thought went into this movie. Don't waste your money, go wash your hair or clean out your belly button, either would be more entertaining."
3,Gross Pointe Blank remake in another setting,"This movie has basically the same plot as Gross Pointe Blank. I would say it's not quite as goof, but still good. If you liked GPB you'll like War, inc."
1,SUB-PAR Movie,This movie was a definite let down for me. While the acting is great the writing was just terrible. It strays far from its intended plot and focuses on an exploited middle eastern teenage pop star. While it did have brief flashes of humor I barely made it through to the end. Once the end FINALLY came the obvious twist unfolded and I remained unimpressed and bored.
3,Kinda Blah,"I loved ""Grosse Point Blank"" and ""High Fidelity"" with Cusack and ""My Cousin Vinny"" with Tomei. Didn't love this movie, though. Although the production quality was really good and the acting was decent, it just didn't work for me. It seemed like it was mixing too many genres and not doing any of them justice."
2,Not as good as expected.,"I wanted this movie to be good. As a member of Iraq Veterans Against the War who opposes our nation's militarism, I thought this caricature would be entertaining. Alas, it was not. This film failed to capture my attention and failed to provide any stimulation, intellectual or otherwise, throughout the duration.Although I believe it is worthy of watch, it is not the cerebral satire of contemporary American policy that I thought it would be."
1,YIKES!!!!,"This book fails to address the fact that there are ALWAYS 2 people in any dynamic, and only puts the blame on the offending partner, instead of looking at WHY it happened. Shaming someone does not help anyone grow. I do not believe this interpretation of the author's belief about what the Bible says.I loved his other book ""A Marriage Made in God's Eyes,"" but I found this book almost in direct contradiction to that one. I DO NOT recommend this book."
1,Big Bug,I installed this program twice on my computer to make sure and in both cases it caused big problems. I am still working to fix them.
1,"Simply Awful. Watch 'Excalibur', instead.","There are very few movies that (in my opinion) are not worth $1 which is what I paid to rent this bilge, but this movie certainly makes that cut. I spent a considerable portion of the movie speculating on what prompted a group of (presumably) reasonably intelligent people to make this movie. The sad part was watching Martin Short, an excellent actor, and Sam Neill go though their lines like they were reading aloud from a book. They have zero chemistry together, and the attempt of a romance between Neill & Rossellini is so out of place, as to be excruciatingly painful to watch. I don't think it's funny that they tried to pass this ""chick flick"" off as a mythological film. That's what Merlin truly is.....a ""chick-flick"". I guess the producers forgot to watch 'Excalibur' and learn how to make a REAL Arthurian movie before embarking upon Merlin. My suggestion: avoid it at all costs. If someone wants you to watch it with them, get them to pay for your ticket."
5,Merlin is a great piece to go alonside Excaliber,This is one of best movies that only came out on tv. I highly recommend it along with Excaliber. I would say watch this first and then the older movie. Both of these are the best about King Arther and Merlin
2,Could have been better.,"Entertaining movie if you overlook the flaws. Special effects are a bit cheezy, Queen Mab's hoarse voice becomes tiring, some stilted dialogue from others, but Sam Neill does excellent work of coarse.What about Uther's wake? Did anyone notice that his body almost falls off the table when one leg of the table partially collapses? The actors go on just as if nothing happens. I thought someone would adlib, ""Look a sign from the gods, Uther's lineage is rejected and Arthur should be king"". At the very least, the director should have reshot the scene."
1,Too overrated.,"I really can't understand how this movie ever saw the day of light. There was all this advertised hoopla on NBC about how great it was, but it was just three hours of my life I want back. The love story was pointless and just plain annoying. The only decent part is when the credits start to roll at the start and end of the film. I would much rather watch a documentary about Merlin than to ever watch this movie again. This is one of the the few films about King Arthur and Merlin that I would least recommend anyone seeing. My Score: 1 out of 5"
1,An unbelievably poor attempt to follow a classic,"While ""Excalibur"" sits atop my all-time movie list, this sucessor finds its way to the bottom. Sam Neill couldn't even save this horrendous movie. The acting was about the quality of modern soap operas, and the script was just pitiful. I felt I would be wasting my time as I stuck the disc into my DVD player, but I choked in utter disbelief. The only part that I liked made me laugh=the reunion of Martin Short and Mr. Ed. Ok, I forgot the horse's name but it sure sounded a lot like him. Apart from this, the film sickened me, and it saddened me that they couldn't come up with something better after many previous attempts. The only thing this movie accomplished was that it made me appreciate ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"" a whole lot more. Now, that was a masterpiece."
5,Great movie version of Merlin,"I like this version of Merlin very well and Sam Neil for whom I remember best as Grant in Jurassic Park does a wonderful job portraying Merlin. The story pretty much plays out much like most other King Author and Merlin movies but this is not just another Excalibur or King Author - Merlin clone, where this version of the story stands out is how its told and the different outcome of the movie ending.If enjoy these fantasy type movies, its a must have for your collection, this one in particular is getting harder to find.Merlin"
5,Quite good.,"When this was first aired on TV I recorded it onto a VHS tape and watched it plenty of times after. I have yet to read any other reviews of this product on this website, many of which appear to be a bit disapproving, but I've always enjoyed this movie. It can be a bit silly at times, but I find it most often to be very watchable and fun."
5,Merlin - another twist,"Nothing wrong with the movie. The kids did not care for it, but will stay in the collection none the less."
2,Much different interpretation of the Arthurian legends.,"3-hour NBC miniseries tells the Arthurian legends from Merlin's perspective, and is largely unsuccessful. Sam Neill is superb as the titular character (Creating the most convincingly human Merlin to date) and Isabella Rossellini has never looked lovelier (The two also have a lot of striking chemistry), but the film suffers from a poor supporting cast, an abundance of rushed scenes (made even worse on the shortened video version), and a lot of cheesy special effects from the Jim Henson company. Maybe a rental, at best."
1,Very lame,"This movie is just very lame. I mean the actors themselves are actually quite good, but the story line development is lame. Character development direction is virtually non-existent. The lines are poorly crafted that even people with the most juvenile sense of humor will cringe in pain as each line is delivered. I forced myself through the whole film to ensure I was not judging a book by its cover, but with the exception of a few rare moments this movie is surely one that you will want to forget. This a movie should have been left on the shelf. Don't feel like you've missed anything if you haven't seen this one."
1,"No EXCALIBUR, that's for sure....mediocre at best.","""Excalibur"" proved that a movie can provide the setting for a spellbinding/magical story, action, intelligent character interactions, and nail-biting suspense. Unfortunately, ""Merlin"" fails miserably on all four counts. The culprits here are obvious plotting, mediocre acting, and pedestrian direction. The film has one legitimate surprise (no plot spoiler here), but it's way too easy to figure out the rest of the action before it happens. Martin Short fares the best of the cast, but he's stuck with the stereotypical role of the bumbling side-kick often found in most slapstic comedy films. Sam Neill shows no screen presence as the main character of Merlin who has to make things right. As for the direction, the film moved too slowly (especially at the beginning). Since I was always sure of MERLIN's outcome (unlike ""Excalibur""), the special effects were the film's only lure, and they were poorly done at best."
4,One of the best fantasy movies ever,S*u*i*e mothers that writes this move is bad Its the greates fantasy movie yet made This move got everything + its a long move If you like moveis like dragonheart and robin hood-pot thene don't hezitate to buy this one Its the BEST
1,Tired and Overdone....,"Yet another version of the tired and overdone tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This time the story centers around the life of Merlin, but not actually based(not even loosely) on anything we know which has been written about him. The movie is a 2 part mini-series originally presented on NBC over 2 days in 1998. That part is a mystery, but everything else is tedious and predictable. If you need a sorceror's fix, rent Willow or Lord of the Rings instead."
3,Lovely Mordred,"A wonderfull film, only with too much magic. It wasn't realistic anymore. The characters Mordred and his aunty Mab were played very well and also the character Merlin. It's a pity that it was so different from the real ""King Arthur""-story. All together it was a nicy story, but not as good as Excalibur."
2,NO LETS NOT GO TO CAMELOT.,"I thought this was a dull movie. atipical of tv moives. littel charture and meandering plot. Sam neil is an allright actor but he does not make that much of an impresion as merlin. nicol williamson was much better. we have a lot of big time hollywood actors in here but they also dont make much of an impression. we also have an evil fairy queen not in the original leagend. most of the arthurian figures are in the back ground not really convicingly portrayed. lancelot, guinever, morgan le fay, uther, and arthur himself had very littel charture. they had no pesonality. they were just their. they are like cardboard figures of the arthurian chartures. MISTS OF AVLION and EXCALIBURE are much better versions of the story. this movie is not very good."
3,Not well designed,"Two problems with this unit.1. Light from your bulbs sometimes shut this thing off, causing lights to turn off.2. Will not control a relay so that you can use high powered lights. Won't be a problem for homeowners though."
1,Crummy mop,"The mop handle for the Bona products is awful. It doesn't assemble easily, and falls apart at the drop of the hat! I like the Bona product, but wish I hadn't bought the mop."
1,Poor quality product,This was the second time that I purchased this product. The first time the handle broke after two uses. The next one I bought broke the first time I used it. Do not order this product. The company refused to replace the handle saying that I missed the returns window.
1,BonaKemi,"This product was so badly designed and built that the handle broke while I was attaching the velcro cleaning pad to the bottom of the device. The handle is two pieces that screw together, very poorly and cheaply made. There is an upgraded model available with sprayer attached that would probably be a better purchase, albeit a more expensive one."
2,"Bad directing, writing, wasting excellent actors","Wonderful actors wasted in a bad story. Carradine, a classic and great actor, had nothing to do, and Matt Schulze, a truly unique and intense performer, one to be reckoned with on the big screen, could not overcome the seemingly endless TV Cable-Movie-cliches of a sanity-challenged psychic cop. Lochlyn Munro deserves mention, also as a talented actor who deserves much better. Perhaps it looked much better in script form.Glass Backwards"
1,Valley Girl Aliens,"Zettel's attempts to create aliens are what you might expect from a junior high school girl. There is nothing alien about them. Emotionally, her aliens are from Van Nuys, translated into different bodies. Don't bother."
5,A lovely book for all.,So many delicious recipes! Some of the recipes are very unique-haven't thought of that! Simply perfect to prepare for the upcoming Lenten season.
2,not reliable,"A few soups are good (e.g., the parsnip soup), but many are quite flavourless. Perhaps useful in a library, but not a high priority. I have made many more poor soups from this book than tasty ones."
3,a bit repetitive,"This is a good soup book but I marked it with only 3 stars because it is rathrer repetitive in the ingredients. It seems like most of the recipes call for carrots, leeks and potatos, then the rest of soup is built around that. They're good recipesbut you sure couldn't do it for twelve months!"
5,Muziklvr,Another fantastic release from Jeff Lynne and Company. Unlike the ARTISTS and MUSIC we have today (And I use those two words loosely). Secret Messages comes from a time when Origional Talent and Musicianship were prevalent.
3,Time Waits for No One,"I really like the '80s ELO. There is no comparison between the '70s and '80s material. And, why bother to do so. What we get hear is a sound that combines great pop with stellar production. And if you listen closely, you hear a sound that went on to propel Tom Petty (Full Moon Fever and Into The Great Wide Open) and George Harrison (Cloud Nine) to the top of the charts. In the '80s, computers should replace the strings. Technology marches on."
3,A Scrapped Double Album Project With Tired Lynne,"Besides ""Rock'n'Roll Is King"", this is just a collection of average or fair songs which showed that their heyday were over. ""Stranger"" and ""Loser Gone Wild"" is possible highlights here with their easy listening potentials.""On And On"" and ""Letter From Spain"" is just boring, while ""Time After Time"", ""Danger Ahead"" and ""Train Of Gold"" is ill-fated attempts which should have been scrapped from the album. With added bonus tracks this is more interesting than the original, especially the instrumental gem ""After All"", but overall this is a disappointing effort. Some of the songs Lynne scrapped for release were better than most of these songs...."
3,Dan Hunter is amazing!,"This is a really low budget horror movie, and it's really not very good. The only thing that saves it is Dan Hunter's understated performance as a local detective. It's the best on screen smelling I've ever seen! Clearly, Gunnar Hansen's fragile ego was the reason that his role was limited to three lines. Dan Hunter should be in more movies. Especially ones where the role requires someone to smell something."
4,Pit Fiend,"What can you say....Candace & Co. Slay us again......The music is tight, this album has alot of heart and deepth, it is not one big breakdown, although when the time comes, they can give plenty of motivation to get moving. The vocals bring out alot of emotion in me and make viens pop out of my head and neck from the unrelenting viciousness and aggression. Buy this album, learn the words, see the live show (Lots of Energy), find the pit, make your presence known!"
1,"NOT TRUE,TOTAL LIE,FALSE ADVERTISING",Can't give a true review on this product because when you order this light the company sends you something completely different.Then they will not refund your shipping and then you have to pay to send it back which isn't refunded either.
3,Great for extending your game time.... but....,"the fans can become very very LOUD during startup!!! One might be able to get new fans from a computer store and replace it (high quality recommended), but overall I would recommend this or something similar to anyone with an xbox 360!"
1,warning,"Ok folks heres the deal. Theres alot of miss information flying around about the 360. There is a chip inside you 360 that makes it work. it is a piece of junk and is poorly attached to the mother board. it gets hot and pops off causeing the glorious red ring of death (been there twice). the intercooler attempts to stop this from happening. It doesn't always work, but it will help reduce the chances of this happening. On the flip side the intercooler can cause other problems such as stealing power from the 360. If you don't have a 360 don't buy one until the next 360 comes out. It is soposed to have a better chip and be attached more securely. If your 360 is dead (and you don't have a recet like me) there is hope I searched the web and found a way to fix the chip it took about 7 hours and $50 worth of tools and parts. good luck and may the force be with you."
1,Please do not buy this item,"I purchased this item to try and keep myself from ending up as one of the people who had their Xbox burn out, because of overheating. This intercooler however melts to your Xbox, and causes you to get red rings. When I took the intercooler off part of it was melted and the plugs where it plugged into the back of the Xbox, and where the plug went into the back of the intercooler were all browned out and burned. Thank god it didn't do any damage to my Xbox, as my Xbox worked fine after I took it off. Also when it was working it was extremely noisy anyway. It also seems as though it wasn't really keeping the Xbox that cool. Just please do not buy this item."
1,Sounds like a blender.,"I bought this to cool down my 360; I thought it might be a good idea to keep it cool so that I might add life to the console. But I just don't care anymore if my Xbox explodes into a fire ball, I can't listen to the three unbalanced fans anymore. I'm in the Navy, ON A SUBMARINE, so I can handle loud noises, fans and grown men screaming them self's to sleep!(Just kidding, he probably just dropped the bunk pan on his hand) but not this product. I gave it 3 months. Then I removed it, said some calming words and then struck it with a rock to ease its passing to junk heaven. May is find peace with the virtual boy, power glove and jaguar 64.I recommend you just keep you system in an open area with at least 1 1/2 inches clearance around all sides. That should be enough."
2,The where and why,"Intercooler fit my xbox 360 as it should. The tight fits and the fans were of ok quality. I have owned a few gaming pcs and the fans on this unit are comparable to a pair of standard 80mm ""cooler master"" fans. Not much more, not much less. There u go."
1,Waste of money,"You don't need this. 360's do not have that much of an overheating issue. Plus, I'm hearing that these things are known to kill your 360. So, don't waste your money."
1,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU,"I had this in my cart and just ""Thought"" it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment. I cannot thank ALL of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do.Thank you all again!mckinley"
1,don't bother,"I purchased this item along with the 360 after reading many horror stories about over heating issues. This was the first part of October.After plugging the cooler in, the console would operate for about 15 seconds before the red eyes appeared.Plain and simple - my console will not operate with the cooler attached.The worst part of all is the console runs at room temp. I can hardly detect any heat generated at all.Save your money."
1,Terrible horrible no-good very bad product.,"Avoid this at all costs. It screws up your power supply and will overheat and fuse itself into your 360's power input where it connects. Also, if you mention having it at all to the 360 repair center they will void your warranty and make you pay like $100 or more to fix it."
1,Bad News,"I purchased this Intercooler and it's been on my XBOX 360 for only 2 weeks and it cause my console to shutdown - unable to turn unit back on. Called tech support and they said I needed a new power supply ($80). Eventually, after Intercooler was removed, the power came back on and console has been working fine since. Would not recommend this - it's not Microsoft so beware of aftermarket accessories for XBOX360 - they're trouble."
2,Why would you buy this?,Yeah the XBOX 360 gets warm but this doesn't do anything. Its like the nightly news: They use fear to sell product. You are supposed to think something is wrong and that your XBOX is going to blow up if you don't have the cooler. The XBOX gets hot but this is ridiculous. Save your money for a game or some fast food lunches. This is pointless. I'm reviewing my friends because I wouldn't be fearful enough to buy this.
1,No. Bad,This is a terrible porduct because its energy source is the xbox 360 which makes the 360 work more which over heats it but wait then the fan cools it. So you are really spending money on something that might break yuor system or might look funny on the back of the 360 and do nothing
1,Why does amazon do this?,"Why is it every time someone starts raving about how good an item is thats so cheap, amazon boosts the price up about 30 dollars? Seriously wtf."
1,oblivion issues?,"wow, Oblivion locked up for everyone due to bugs, not because the Xbox 360 has issues. the Xbox version locks up now and then and the PC version crashes to desktop. is that because the PC version is being played on overheated PC's? no. nor is the locking up caused by hot 360's.plz don;'t be such a tool. don't blame a game's bugs on a console. Oblivion is a great game. Oblivion has nada to do with the Xbox 360 locking up thanks to heat problems. Oblivion locks up because of code bugs."
1,I really hate it.,"Some way there is a defect contact or an unrevised consume of electricity that makes the xbox shutdowns suddenly, which is unacceptable."
4,Great but not perfect,"This product does a great job cooling down my console, after 4-6 hours of activity my console is still only warm, the intercooler can be a tad noisy though, and lately when I tunr it on it make a louder sound, I unplugged it for the xbox and plugged it back in and it works fine thuogh. The box includes a breakdown of temperature before and after intercooler use, and the intercooler runs off the xbox's power so there is no need ot another oulet. Over all a very good pruduct and worth the money over replacing an xbox for overheating problems"
4,cool accessory,"its really good to cool ur xbox...the noise though is the only thing that sucks. it makes quite a loud noise compared to how its supposed to originally run, but i really don't mind....its a good investment to protect ur xbox"
1,Horrible!!! Do not buy!!!!,"This stupid piece of shoddy workmanship broke my xbox! I am so mad! DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE PIECE OF JUNK! And if you did buy it, do not put it on your xbox! We bought this stupid thing, put it on our xbox, had to endure the noisy sounds it put out because we thought it would keep our system from burning out. Boy were we wrong! Don't make our mistake. Shortly after we bought it, our system started freezing. Now all we get are some flashing red lights when you turn the system on. We cannot play any games on our system. We have to send the system back in. DO NOT BUY THIS STUPID THING!!! It is NOT a Microsoft product. Do NOT put this piece of junk on your expensive console. The only reason I gave it a star is because I think I have to. If anybody wants to start a class action law suit against this piece of junk, hey, I'm game!!!!"
2,Kind of messed up my 360,"It kept my 360 cool, but after about a month I started getting the 3 red blocks(where the player green icons are) and it pretty much means that something isnt connected properly. After having my game messed up several times, I removed the cooler on the back, and never had the problem again. Also I had my 360 since they came out, and still use it and i never overheated, so buying this is pretty much worthless"
2,Not needed.,"I used this the first month I had the 360...and then I got the red lights of doom. Turns out is was just the connection via the cooler. Once I took it off I have had zero issues...and that was over 2 years now. (Forgot to do a review till now) So, only get this if your 360 is in a place with poor venting. Otherwise it is a waste of money."
1,Broken. Pointless.,"First of all, it's sad that someone would put out a product (the 360) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself, unless you spend another 10% of the product cost on a little series of fans.Second, I attached this. I plugged it in. It wouldn't even turn on. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open, uncluttered, unblocked area. If you absolutely must provide additional airflow, just point a $10 clip-on fan at it."
3,"Again, Not rocket science","I wanted some creative ideas for gifts etc. for the holidays. This book doesn't exactly offer anything one might be able to find on the web. While most of the drinks are easy to make, with ingredients you probably already have, the result is just that; a mix of random items from the cupboard, some of which come together in a revolting slurry, which I would not offer to guests. Lots of Tang, cinnamon and coffee creamer are used here, so my suggestion is to get creative, you can probably create the same (if not better) results by some playing with the recipes given."
5,Very Well Written.,This book is amazing. It unlocked so many secrets and blew away stereotypes with ease. I rccommend for Dom's and Sub's alike.
4,A basic for newcomers and experienced alike,"A great book to lead you into the world of BDSM or to lead you further. The Dominant and submissive point of view is nice for both aspects to delve into understanding their own, and their partners line of thinking. A must for any bondage collection."
5,Excellent,"I learned a great deal about both myself and my partner from this book. There were certian things I did not even know were possibilities, or where they were coming from. This book helped me understand a lot more about BDSM and painted it in a light that is fun for anyone to read and enjoy."
5,Yummy and educational,"I've had and given away numerous copies of this book. It's my favorite intro for newbies, full of information and fun attitude. Even for long time BDSMers, it's worth the read. Beats the hell out of 50 Shades!"
5,Good Gate - Highly Recommend,"I looked at several types/prices of gates before settling on this one. We bought two - they were both installed within 10 minutes and they've been reliable and safe. We then went on to buy a third for my parents. We've got them hardware mounted but a nice feature is the ability to take them off the wall, leaving the hardware in place, for use somewhere else."
3,Just OK,I purchased this as a quick fix to block off our kitchen from the living room. I have a more permenant one I use for other areas but I wanted something quick and easy to put up and down in this one area. It's just OK. I wouldn't recommend this as your main safety gate. It's lightweight and easy to set up but not very durable. There is no way to adjust for uneven surfaces like with some other gates. There are much better options out there but at this price you can't expect too much.
5,"ELO ""TIME"" REMASTER IS TIMELESS!","This cd deserves a 10 star rating. The fidelity is absolutely breathtaking from start to finish. It always was a high quality recording but this remastered version is like hearing it for the very first time.If you are new to ELO's music and don't own any of their cd's start with this one. There isn't a bad tune here and the bonus tracks are just as great, especially ""When Time Stood Still"". Other standout tracks are ""The Way Life's Meant To Be"", ""21st Century Man"", ""Rain Is Falling"", ""Ticket To The Moon"", and the big hit ""Hold On Tight"". Jeff Lynne is one of the most overlooked guitarists in rock and roll history. Another bonus is the cd itself has the album cover artwork on it. I can't wait for the next batch of ELO remasters. Buy this cd, set your cd player on repeat and let it play over and over! ""Zoom"" is a classic too. Welcome back Jeff, don't make us wait another 15 years!"
3,Looks nice ... despite damage ... too bad about the low light,"I'll admit I should have read the full specs. It says very clearly that it only accepts 35w bulbs. 5 35w halogen bulbs are about bright enough to light a very, very small bathroom. Since I was replacing a 5-light fixture ... I figured this would work fine.I'm going to try some experiments with higher wattage bulbs (against manufacturer's warning) to see if it will work.The fixture itself is very attractive, however, like others, I had some shipping damage. Since it was on the top (where no one will see), I didn't see a reason to return it.All in all ... I would consider other options before ordering this fixture."
4,"Very nice light, just not quite perfect.","It assembles well, it looks fantastic, and it gives off a moderate amount of light. This is not a super bright vanity light for your bathroom sink/mirror area. That is where I installed it, and it works, but it isn't quite bright enough. It sure looks good though!Complaints:The edges on this product are a little sharp/rough. I didn't hurt myself on them, but it implies a lower build/manufacturing quality than it actually looks like in daily use. Not really a big deal, as the only person that will know is whoever installs it. The guests and wife are none the wiser.4 out of 5 only due to the lumen output is lower than expected, and the ""rough-ish"" edges. Great value! (Just don't use it as your only light source in your bathroom or wherever.)"
3,lite?,Easy install good design but does not project from wall far enough to provide adequate light for shaving and such.great for baths with recessed cabinet.
3,"Nice, not great","The unit came in the mail wrapped in masking tape and a retail box. The entire unit is very light weight and easy to install. Sadly for me, one of the glass pieces was broken on arrival. The unit is very pleasing aesthetically, but is not worth its cost in my opinion."
5,great seller,arrived on time and in perfect conditions.this is a shure sm58 dressed like the classic tlefunken mic. works fine for live shows.
2,"Adorable, but won't last long","For a 55 lb GSD puppy -- lasted about 2 days longer than the usual 30 minutes for any sort of chew toy. very flimsy and unless it is for a very small dog or an older one with no teeth, I'd keep looking!"
3,Good Deal but Poor Sound Quality,"It's a good little stereo and works great with my ipod. It came quickly and is reasonably priced. The sound quality isn't the greatest, but it does the trick nicely for the price."
1,don't by a lamp from Lite Source,"I bought this lamp here. My son broke one of the glass lamp shades. I've tried for a year to get a replacement. Lite Source gives me a run around, and when I ask vendors, they say Lite Source won't respond to them either. I like the lamp, just don't have anything go wrong."
2,Not good for my dog,"I fed Nutro Lamb & Rice to my Min Pin for about 8 months because it was on the recommended list at the county shelter. Recently someone suggested that I stop feeding it to her, and I learned about recommendations at a DogFoodAnalysis site.While eating Nutro, my dog's pee was entirely clear and her poop was hard as a rock (she actually looked uncomfortable).Based on recommendations, I switched to Innova Adult Small Bites. Within a day, my dog's pee was appropriately yellow again and withn two days her poo was normal (not rock hard, with less straining). I don't know if there's a link, but I'm glad we switched.Innova Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food"
1,"Confusing, disorganized, riddled with errors in the examples","I bought this book hoping for a complete, concise, and clear treatment of SQL.Unfortunately, what I got was a confusing, disorganized mess of a book whose examples are full of obvious typos (eg, they use inconsistent names for the same database columns within a single example -- didn't anyone proofread this book?), and whose explanations often do more harm than good.To take just one example: early in the book there's a 15 line SQL query full of operators the reader has not yet been introduced to, whose explanation points out that ""this example includes a left outer join"". Fair enough, but this is within the first 40 pages or so of the book, and the author hasn't actually told the reader what a left outer join *is*, or why the reader should care.The careless construction and copy-editing of this book makes it more confusing than enlightening. My copy will be going back to the bookstore."
3,It's okay....,"~After listening to Bruch: Double Concerto, Walton: Viola Concerto ~ for a few years, I find this one lacking in projection of power in my mind.Pieces on this CD are on the one with Bruch/Walton; better Violinist, Conductor and Performer equals better sounds.Don't hesitate to check out my newly published book:""Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence and Romance"""
2,Disappointing,"If this is her best (as indicated by many others here), I'm incredibly disappointed. I bought this CD because I heard one song (from ""Soul Journey"") that I liked on the radio. After reading the reviews, I chose this CD because it was the most raved about.Three of the songs on this CD sound just like her tune on ""Oh Brother..."" The rest of the CD is, well... mediocre. There's absolutely nothing original or touching here. I don't care about Gillian's background, I just want to listen to great music. This is not great music. She sounds like any other mediocre country-folk artist...."
4,Gillian Welch - Revival,"Sweet, Soulful folky Style. Beatiful songs. Mostly acoustic guitar and vocal. Love it! jp"
5,Wonderful,"Never thought I'd enjoy a CD of this genre NOT performed by EmmyLou Harris so much -- but I do! Buy this one, you won't be sorry. From Ms. Welch's heartfelt singing to Rawling's superb playing this is one CD everyone should have in their collection and on their top ten list."
2,How waterproof is the question,"We had one of these for about a year, and it died. The motion sensor was the culprit.I replaced the sensor & did a postmortem on the dead one. Egads, judging by the algae at the bottom of the sensor there was about 1 inch of water retained inside the case for a significant period of time. The bottom part of the circuit board was disgusting.Judging from the case construction, the water got in via the 'lip' which is formed by the back of the case joining the front. There was no gasket around the lip, nor sealant around the entire perimeter, etc....furthermore, the adjustment controls are assuredly not waterproof.Yet, to be fair, one could not build that circuit for that price. It is just the absence of a sealed case & rust proof screws which prevents the heath zenith from being a solid product. Desa handles the Heath Zenith stuff these days.I live in Ohio, with a real winter, spring & summer - which may have contributed to the sensor's early demise. Caveat Emptor!"
2,Product Doesn't Match Editorial Review!,"Amazon's Editorial Review indicates that you can update mailing lists with this product ""with the click of a button"". While the product does contain the listings, updating your mailing list will require the clicking of a multitude of buttons, after you print out or write down all of the information. The product has no ability to create or modify a mail merge list. The Yellow Pages USA Deluxe edition apparently has the ability to create a mail merge list for use with a word processor, but per INFOUSA's sales staff this can only be done for a single heading/zip code combination at a time. The Deluxe version is not available at this time through Amazon, and is quite a bit more expensive ($150)."
1,First Major Disappointment in On-Line Book Purchasing,Just was not what I was expecting. Anticipated a regular information book with indepth interesting history of the dachshund breed --received a childrens book with a few pages of cute pictures and little information. Ordered this prior to it being published and there wasn't any witten description. My mistake. First book I have ever returned for credit.
4,Jericho is a bad mutha hush yo' mouth,"Jericho is the story of this book. He's the one I enjoyed most.My favorite Jericho lines:""You don't have the vision to run this muthaf**ka!""""Don't you get it? I'm a born warrior. Born to kick ass and take names.""""I know lookin' at all them cops right now is scary. But you gotta stay focused. We gon' get outta this sh*t, okay? They're more scared than you, believe me. It'll be over quicker than the Gulf War.""""But know this, you f**k over my brother and yo' life is over. You write about retribution; I carry the sh*t out."""
5,Over and above,"We had a Kitchenaid 1/2 hp installed when we built our home. It did okay, lasting about 5 years before going kaput. So I bought another just like it. Bad idea, since the motor went out within 6 months. I found this Whirlaway on Amazon and read reviews on it on Amazon and other sites before buying it (at an excellent price too). ""Whirl""away, coins the phrase completely. It is super quiet, and does its job within 1-2 seconds."
3,Slugghish & lackluster,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I love both the concerto & the quintet, and looked forward to hearing Sarah Chang's interpretation. What I found was a sluggishly paced performance (particularly in the 3rd movement) which sucked dry a lot of the piece's vibrancy. As for the quintet, it just seems to lack any personality or pizzazz at all. It is quite puzzling; I am familiar with the work of both Sarah Chang and Leif Ove Andsnes, and usually they deliver performances that are much more interesting than this."
4,Solid Intro to SSRS,"This book served as a decent read as well as decent reference material for using SSRS.I could have done without the author's attempts at humor with lines such as ""Be prepared. You're about to enter... the Matrix!"". I would have preferred a ""dryer"" more serious approach however I can live with the writer's style because the book delivered on content."
3,"Good textbook, poor reference","I agree with others who say this book is fine as a text but a poor reference. The best way to use this book is read it cover to cover, work out the examples at your computer and take your own notes, because the structure of the book just doesn't lend itself to use as a reference. There is a lot of good information here, but it isn't easy to use outside of the context in which it was written."
2,Not for serious developers,"While this book provides a good overview from absolute basics (like how to write sql statements and join tables) to more advanced topics, it does so in a story-telling fashion. In other words, you need to interact with the sample files and step through exercises. This is useless to me. A good reference is way more useful. Like most developers, I need the ability to find a topic in the index and jump to an explanation and some sample code. I don't want to do exercises."
2,I too prefer the technical reference methodology,"I have nearly 15 years of report writing experience using Crystal, Oracle, Access and other less common report writing tools. I need to be able to hit the index, grab a topic and run with it. For example, shading alternate rows is a fundamental report tool. However, trying to find out how to do that in 60 seconds or less was impossible with this book. Further, I found that the order in which topics was presented was a bit ""interesting"", considering that publishing reports was one of the first topics covered. This may be a great book, but it just didn't fit my needs."
2,Not what I was looking for,I teach middle school Spanish and our theme was myths and legends. The movie does not have any thing to do with the actual legend. This movie was not interesting or appropiate for my students. I wasted my money.
4,"Lovely, but perhaps not for everyone","I'm an anise fiend, so the vanilla/anise note that LL is constructed around was a clear winner, and I'm thrilled to find a vanilla scent that's not sickly sweet as so many tend to. Very strong projection on my skin, and it lasts and lasts, so I apply pretty lightly.The 3oz bottle will probably last me quite a while but once it's gone I'll definitely be on the lookout for more."
3,Very Loud with No Volume Control,"Our toddler loves Sesame Street, so he was thrilled to receive this toy. He dances when he hears the alphabet song, which is cute and educational. But, it's simply too loud to tolerate. We had to take the bus apart to insert a cardboard barrier in the speaker in order to muffle the sound a little. If this had a volume control, it would be a 4 or 5 star toy; but removing the 20 screws in the back to put in our own damper is a little ridiculous."
2,Works intermittently,"We received this as a gift and it worked fine for a few weeks, but after a few times using it, it started to work intermittently. There was no way to make it work with consistently except to shake it and drop it. Perhaps, something came loose in the inner workings, but I think the product should have been designed for the rattles and shakes of a young child."
2,Sensor gone after 3 years,"Sensor gone after 3 years, and I cant find my receipt for replacement! I am looking into paying more for a better quality light that is NOT a Heath product."
1,"A Light is a light,is a light,is a light...............","After my order Amozon & the shipper notified me of everything.When my light came i got all the hardware{box,conduit,wireing}I installed it myself{30+yr.const.exp.}and after two hours done.I wired the light to a switch so it would work manually{come on at night off during daytime}This worked twice.Then every night i fought with it to stay on.Loseing this battle every night.My blood presure on the rise,I removed the light disconnected my $30.00 sensor.And now turn the light on/off with the switch.But everytime I mow the back yard.I can look at my new light and see how nice it looks with that $30.00 sensor that don't work."
3,Worked 10 months,"I bought this light from a big box store, so I am returning it today.It lasted 10 months and has died completely.Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a good replacement with a reasonable cost."
4,Still shocking as a work of literature,"Well-formatted for the Kindle, with an easy-to-navigate table of contents. The novel itself is striking -- ""right between the eyes."" Passion has rarely felt so naked, and yet so much of the passion in _Women in Love_ is the passion of intellectual debate. The characters are desperate to know, *finally*, who they are, and flummoxed by their need for such explanation."
2,Bland Year in Tuscany,"Elizabeth Romer chronicles a year in Tuscany. As someone who lived in Italy and even honeymooned in Tuscany, I looked forward to this book. I wasn't really sure what it was. Part cook book and part story of a year in Tuscany, I felt it lacked focus. More importantly, it lacked romance. Her characters seemed distant, almost cardboard figures. I wasn't drawn into their lives. Say what you will about Frances Mayes, but her book brought alive the magic of Tuscany."
1,Get Real,"This man does not live in the real world. While interesting, his bookdoesn't make it easy to follow his suggestions. The language is tooacademic. And the recipes are too long and too boring."
1,Put me to sleep.,"The first album was superior: great balance between new world and loud rock - 5 stars. Second album got more pop-oriented and less dramatic, but was still listenable - 3.5 stars. Nude starts off good and then descends into an inescapable abyss of just plain boring. The energy and passion seems to have burned out. This downward spiral for these three releases leaves me shaking my head..."
1,Quito Atlas Map,Returned product. It was in dirty condition with writing on pages. Very unsatisfactory purchase. Took 3 attempts to return it.
4,Good goggles,Pros:1. The goggles had very minimal leaking2. Very comfortableCons:1. Anti-lens fog doesn't work well
5,Buy it!,"This album emphasizes the instrumental side of Doc and Merle's sizable talents. The tunefulness and ensemble of these two are just marvelous, and the album is recorded in excellent sound, clear and never strident. The superb fiddling of Mark O'Connor is the icing on the cake. No fan of great guitar playing should be without this album."
5,Worth it,"Yes, these cost more than regular pantyhose but they run a lot less and last a lot longer. I don't have any health problems requiring support hose but heard a doctor one time talking to my mom about how they are good for you and your circulation. I also noticed I have less back fatigue (my job is sitting) if I wear these. Not as shear as regular hose but not noticeable really."
1,Miroku Haters,"According to this book, Miroku is 'a bad monk'. One of the reasons given is the time he beat up Jaken, who tried to kill him with the Saimyosho insects. This book fails to recognize that most of the time Miroku is nicer than Inuyasha. He is always there to help Inuyasha, Kagome, Sango and Shippo in battle. His advice tends to be wise, he is extremely intelligent. In the episode with Juramoru and Kageromaru, he jumps in front of Sango to save her.Aside from this, the writers don't know how to spell Tetsusaiga. There is very little mention of Sango and Shippo, and it is overall a substandard read. I don't idealize Miroku, I know he's lecherous and a con man, but this book made him out to be downright evil!"
4,Not as bad as others have said,"I found this book entertaining and definitely not as bad as the other reviewers said. It's not necessarily a book for the older fans; I believe this is something for the younger and newly addicted IY fans that aren't as well-informed about the series as others (especially the die-hard ones) as well as the ones that don't understand the dynamics.It's not necessarily a Miroku-hating book, they just seem to poke fun at him, almost as if they're making the book like the anime, interactive with the characters voices and opinions. They depict Miroku as a lecher, yes, but mostly in jest (My advice, don't take things so seriously when reading this), but the other reviewers also failed to mention that they also show Miroku as brave, friendly and all around strong.Take a chance on this book, if not for yourself as a collector of IY items then for your children or a younger fan you know. It gives enough information to let your imagination run around and think for yourself."
1,Okay for a new person to inuyasha,"I have been a huuge fan pf the manga and i bought this for something further to read. it had info, lots but mostly things i allready knew"
3,It's OK,"The book is informative, and it's not like it's really expensive... Like I said, it's ok. My recommendation is this; if you buy it, buy it used so you get what you pay for."
5,He loved his gift!,I gave this to my brother who is a chef as a gift and he absolutely loves it. It has a ton of interesting facts including recipes for the foods.
4,Fantastic!,"First off, I was impressed with Amazon's service, I chose 5-8 day shipping and they arrived in five days. The shoes look great, and are pretty comfortable, although the right shoe has a bit of abrasive suede at the end where the tougue is stitched to the toe that I can feel on my toe, but I feel this less and less as they break in. Also, I took a risk in not trying them on and just ordering 11s but they are true to size! Thanks Amazon!"
4,Joe homeowner,"I am pleased so far. I have not had the time to use it to its full extent, but am pleased."
4,Not for the superstitious,"If you are the least bit superstitious, skip this rendition of ""Tarot for Beginners."" Nobody needs to psych themself out unnecessarily with ""The Nine of Swords fortells death, failure, utter despair ... an implacable enemy, evil fate!"" And ""The Ace of Swords ... Triumph by Force"" is not necessarily such a positive suggestion either. However, the book is quite clear and well written. (Some of the cards are actually rather flattering.) So, if you are ever asked to do a tarot reading for someone comtemplating a criminal enterprise or other evil deeds, you may find just the material you need here to convince them they're jinxed."
5,17 Post It's,"Visitors can always tell how valuable a book is to me, by counting the number of colored flags sticking out from the pages. And whether or not the flags appear all the way to the end.Word of Mouth Marketing has 17 flags, several turned down corners, a boarding pass, an Amtrack stubb and 2 Metro North tickets. Plus the yellow highted phrases. If you are interestd in practical help (not just advice)- to explode your marketing - this is the book for you."
5,Great intro and reference,"Great introduction to inorganic chemistry.The first chapters introduce the theoretical concepts which will later be useful to describe the chemistry of the elements, and do so in a fool-proof way. The discussion is obviously not that detailed, but gets to the point.The best part of this book is however the one regarding the elements and their chemical behavior. Extremely educative the first time you see it, still very useful later on as a reference. The numerous references to how the elements find use in today's industrial world are a great source of information.The two chapters on catalysis and solid state chemistry are also valuable, albeit concise.The only book which may rival this one is Greenwood's, which isn't as good as this one as a learning text though.Weird the price is so high at amazon... i got it for half the price... new..."
4,"Hannah Senesh, another remarkable woman","I had never heard of Hannah Senesh until I planned to go to Israel and was looking at possible places to visit. After I heard about her I wanted to know more. This book tells the story, in her own words of how a young Jewish woman came to be an Israeli hero. It makes me wonder if I too would have the courtage of conviction to stand up for something even to death. A very remarkable story indeed."
5,A recommandable book and software for groundwater modeling,"PMWIN is an excellent software for the simulation of groundwater flow and transport. This comprehensive software makes it easy to setup own groundwater problems. It comprises a lot of additional programs and useful tools which help to describe and analyse a problem very clearly. For example, a model for the simulation of single and multi-species transport is included as well as the full version of PEST, the famous code for parameter estimation. Many features facilitate showing and printing of the results. The book contains a lot of elucidations and examples. Some features are still in development but should be released soon, like 3D visualization and geochemical model. Alltogether a very recommandable book and software."
3,Too intense for me.,"These guys were fantastic singers! But after listening to a few tracks, it started sounding too familiar and formulaic--like I'd feel if I listened to Patti Page's ""How Much is that Doggy in the Window"" and ""Tennessee Waltz"" back-to-back a few times."
5,FIAT LUX,"One of the most informative works of the year, the reader will gain a strong education of the interconnection of historical indigenous organizations such as the U.N.I.A, N.O.I. M.S.T. and Freemasonic lore. This information would be valuable to the youth of America, all shades, classes, and religous denominations."
3,Disappointed,"I had used Bells B tummy butter while pregnant and loved it. Hoped this product will be as good and as described, however it does not. It does have a bit of minty smell but not enough mint for any cooling effect. Absorbs ok but nothing out of the ordinary for any cream. No expected cooling effect, no relief for tired feet noted."
5,One of my favorites,"I bought this album back in 1987 when I was working at the Bowling Green KY public library. I played it until it sounded scratchy and it got lost in one of my many moves as a student. Now I'm getting it as an mp3. This was the first album that got me started in New Age and folk music. Somehow it always manages to match my mood, no matter what the mood is. It floats, soothes, uplifts and delights.I first HEARD them in 1986 at a concert for Dan Fogelberg. They opened for him, and after they came on, my friend and I didn't hear anything else. I got the album after that."
1,written by a dummy,"there are so many mistakes in the syntax and order of the examples that it makes it practically impossible for the beginner to try the examples and successfully execute. Aweful book, numerous errors, that prohibit the examples from being useful."
4,"Excellent book, but beware of errors","I am a 53-year-old male with no previous experience of programming, and I found the book (the second edition based on the Liberty Basic language) to be worth every cent. It is a fantastic, clear, user-friendly, no-nonsense and humorous introduction to the subject and has really opened my eyes to the world of programming. The Liberty Basic language to which Wang introduces you is tops and really makes sense, compared to some other languages. Beware of a lot of errors, though. I suspect that the book was written or published with undue haste, and as a result some of the examples have not been tested and contain errors. But this can be forgiven, having regard to the overall quality. Since then I have gone on to studying Liberty Basic in more detail. I can heartily recommend both book and language."
1,Outdated and obsolete,"Who uses Liberty BASIC anymore? Worse yet, the software on the CD is too old to run on any machine running Windows XP or newer. It does not cover any sort of object oriented programming in detail, because it was written during a time when text based OS's were the standard. Since Visual BASIC is the preferred flavor for anyone even thinking about using BASIC anymore, this text is inadequate. Might have been useful about 20 years ago, but for anyone recently thinking about purchasing this book: DONT."
2,DoC is way overrated,"Not only does Doc share Ff7 story it had to be about a character almost no1 unlock.the game mechanics were such a let down, felt like I was playing Devil may cry in a FPS.The only reason this game sold was because too many people cant get over FF7."
4,Better than I was expecting!,"I read a lot of reviews about this game and had determined that I was going to be disappointed by this game, but in fact I WASN'T.This game provides good and interesting action. The story was engaging (though not quite as much as the original FF7). My only problem with the game was that it was brief and they tried to cover up the brevity with extra missions. I and I'm sure other FF fans would've preferred the story to have been more detailed and longer.But that is the only flaw. Some people have complained about the camera angles, but I don't see any way it could've been that much better, and with a little skill it isn't a problem.As a very big fan of the original FF7, I am still waiting for something in the Compilation to be really outstanding, but I am still waiting. Perhaps Before Crisis will provide what I am really looking for. But Dirge of Cereberus definitely was worth my time."
3,not typical final fantasy,Not what we were expecting for final fantasy..kinda similar to devil may cry really..but still fun overall. My boyfriend was used to the traditional final fantasy gameplay so this took some getting used to but he still enjoyed it.
1,Yes,"i changed my mind, i didn't really like this game because it's just a straightforward first person shooter. it's like the same thing over and over again, and i hate all things repetitive (::cough:: inuyasha ::cough::). so basically, it's ok, just not my kind of game. final fantasy 7, on the other hand, is totally awesome!"
4,A pleasent suprise,"I never had much interest in the Final Fantasy series, mostly because of the mellow dramatics, the overtly feminine characters and the predictable plot lines. But FF7 Dirge of Cerberus, truely sparked my interest in the ""trilogy"". You don't have to be a rabid fan girl to enjoy Fantasy VII Dirge of Cerberus."
4,Oddly cute!,"Okay, so this is what a meerkat looks like! It gets repeated looks from people, that's for sure. The stuffed animal is well made at least. Children like it."
5,another wonderfull commpilation with new songs,Hallelujah-Legacy Records continued to reissue Mahalia's raisins with new previously unissued material. Wonderfull sounds!Thank You and please go on - give us everything what Mahalia left us to help strengthen our faith.
5,Sunday Morning Prayer Meeting,I just love Mahalia Jackson. I think she is one of the best Gospel singers in the world. Even though she has passed away. I am sure the good Lord is having a good time listening to here sing in Heaven. I would recommend any of here CD to anybody. I just love the title of this album Sunday Morning Prayer Meeting With Mahalia Jackson. The album is temporarily out of stock and I hope Sony Records brings it back?
1,Shocking,This is a delusional book from a great investor. Soros seems to be anti-American and sympathetic of terrorists. He also seems to be filled with blind hatred. What a disgrace. America was heinously attacked and we are responding. What would Soros have done after Pearl Harbor? Negotiated with Japan?Soros should stick to writing books on investing. Soros had a hand in depreciating the value of the British Pound and Asian currencies and he may be betting against the U.S. dollar. His actions may have helped to cause great economic harm to the Asian economy. This is a clear misuse of his power.
3,"Right Place, Wrong Time","When Dr. Elliot Mallory met Georgine ""George"" Hathaway, almost everything seemed to be right. They liked the same jokes, shared a love of sports, and the chemistry that drew them together was the most powerful he'd ever known.But the one thing that was wrong was very wrong, at least in Elliot's mind: she was young and just beginning her career. If she tied herself to him now, she'd be cheated out of all that the future could hold.But if he let her go, what would the future hold for him?"
5,Sexy Georgie has HOT Doc Eliott Tied in KNOTS~ 5 STAR Coulter fun~,"PLOT:sexy Doc Eliot is used to getting his way and at the hospital picnic is creamed by ""teenager"" George who takes his interest~ she is 24 year old Supermodel Georgina~ fun~Dr. Elliott Mallory~ is sexy and hot and soon has his pride mended with a date with sexy George~ how can she afford a JAG at her age? he mistakes her for a HOOKER~ fun~ soon the sexy virgin and the doc are in a steamy romance but the 15 older Elliott dumps her for her being so much younger than he is~ when he spots her PREGNANT image in a magazine he is the one doing the chasing~ this is an EXCELLENT funny audio~ humor romance and a coupe we adore. EARLY Coulter romance~ GREAT reader and at last on audio~ Elliot and George~ 5 STAR fun~"
2,The salary references are a joke,"When was this book written? In the 70's? I clicked ""view inside this book"". Since the salary information they give is so ridiculous I knew no other information could be accurate. I would imagine the salaries would have double, sometimes triple of what they show."
5,This is excellent. I would LOVE a disc accompaniment,"I've done Bikram yoga for two years and am trying to broaden my experience. This book is one of the best I've found. It includes several complete, balanced sequences to do at home, which is a concern of mine since many dvds don't deliver a balanced workout and many books don't help a novice construct one. I am 48 and it addresses physical issues of mine with knowledge and compassion -- and I'm buying my 16-year-old daughter a copy, for the same reason. She will have to share it with me.The only way this book could be improved would be if the authors would issue a dvd or audio cd of the sequences, so I could focus on doing them instead of reading the directions."
5,Wow! A wealth of knowledge!,I just finished reading the entire book and it is a wonderful book packed with great information..I have long been a fan of Patricia Walden who created the yoga sequences for this book.I had not read anything by Linda Sparrowe before but I really enjoyed her style of writing.The main thing I was looking for in this book was how to deal with pelvic floor disorders. And this book addresses them. This book teaches you how to tone your pelvic floor helping with such things as prolapses and also urinary incontinence.Urinary incontinence is something that many women deal with every day but are ashamed to admit to it. There is hope for women with urinary incontinence..whetherthrough yoga or westernized medical treatments.
1,Cold air intake,It was too hard to install not very universal as stated on the ad and wish it would've been easy to put in. Thanks
2,Save your money,"This is a sequel to an early book ""The Matrix and Philosophy"" and like most sequels, its not nearly as good.The only essay, I thought was really good was Nick Bostrom on whether we are in a Matrix. That one by the way is available to read on his website which is well worth a visit.Some I felt were trying to hard to push their ideas thought the movie for example one about Islam and the matrix. Well the movie came from the Wachowski brothers both who are Jews although they were certainly influenced by Christian ideals too, I doubt that they know much about Islam. The only reason I can think its the article there is to sell books to Muslims too.Overall I was most disappointed."
5,A firm favourite,"Although we live in New Zealand I have married into a Dutch family. I kept borrowing this book from our local library and was lucky enough to spot it when it was put in a withdrawn library books sale. I couldn't believe my luck!This is not a fancy book, which adds to it's charm as the jumpers were designed to be practical and solid and warm. The history and photos alongside the patterns, and the instructions which make it possible to create a jumper all of your own makes this one of my favourite knitting books to leaf through.I also particularly like the way the patterns are placed in their geographical settings. I eventually plan to design and knit my children jumpers out of this book, when they are a little bigger so they don't grow straight out of them. While the tiny place their Oma grew up in is not in the book there are enough hints at the styles for that area to make me feel confident I can do something that is representative of that location.It is an absolute gem of a book."
3,Mostly Satisfied,"I would not consider the dress fully gold. It was more of a champagne color. Also I am 5'7 and I had to hem the dress at least 5 inches to make it the appropriate length for a cocktail attire (right below the knees). The dress originally came two inches from my ankles. But, the dress is pretty."
4,three daughters & Pacificplex,"Great price, good quality dress,fantastic selection of sizes and styles. We'll be back for more!!"
1,No magic or mystery tour.,"If you want to see a lot of magic,then don't buy this dvd.There's precious little of it.If you want to see a documentary of the countries visited,then it is quite good.Overall,the title is a misnomer.There is no magic or mystery."
5,In a word - Spellbinding,"This book has the perfect balance of photography and story telling. Being an aspiring landscape photographer, this book was truly inspirational.Not to mention that if you love the mountains (but live in the city), this book will make you want to relocate. Unbelievably good photography."
4,Presents by Jake,"This book will make a great gift for the holidays, especially for all the people on your list who are hard to buy for, or who have a lot of great ideas, but never see them through. I even picked up one as a gift for myself!"
3,"Huh, doesn't cure cancer?... wtf !!!?","Like said in another review, it may be these authors were forced to write things or it is someone's doco background getting in the way of the whole truth. I saw that SOMEONE wrote on here ""cancer doesn't respond to"" fasting...wtf? There is somebody bad involved in the writing of this book. Fasting is a cure all - nothing is excluded, not cancer, nothing. However cancer IS a multi mill or bill ion dollar industry and it is in everyone's best interest (except for you and I) that we don't know The Cure. Parts of the book are complete b. s. Just know that while reading."
4,"Close, but no cigar","First, the pros: The HP-8550 is a marvel of design, comely, compact, yet robust enough for a high-output office. Color is reliable, and once calibrated correctly, excellent in fidelity!The Cons: It is slow, seems to take forever to warm up, and although the mfgr's specs indicate 53 seconds for a color print, you could not prove it by ours. For a printer designed to produce up to 60,000 pages per month, it seems a bit finicky and tempermental. It is difficult to cancel a print job once it's sent, unless you trek over to the machine and manually push ""cancel."" The drum kits seem to use up way too soon, and are awkward to replace. Likewise the color cartridges.All-in-all, it's a good printer, but for the expense, I would like to see some improvements."
4,A Must Read for my Clients,"As a consultant who works with leaders from the profit and not for profit sectors I am recommending The Art of Connecting to all of my clients. It gives clear examples and easy to follow ""tips and traps"" for working through differences ranging from class, age, gender, disabilities and race. In today's crazy world being able to build rapport and communicate effectively are essential skills for successful people."
3,Good Book,This book was a little hard for me to understand. Music doesn't come easy for me but I keep trying. I think it's a good book but not for me. I need music for dummies I guess or the thick headed.
2,Flaky after first use,"Worked great first use - could switch through sounds and turn massage on/off. Rinsed off after use and could not turn off the sounds, had to remove battery to turn it off.Very comfortable, just don't expect to count on the features working well."
2,A Faint Echo,"Readers of Cherry Wilder's ""Rulers of Hylor"" will return to a world familiar to them from the pages of _A Princess of the Chameln_, _Yorath the Wolf_, and _The Summer King_, but Reimann cannot match the graceful prose style and light-handed touch that made Wilder a master fantasist.This reader can easily tell where Wilder's plot-notes end and Reimann's authorship begins. For fantasy fans not already familiar with Wilder's tales may find this a satisfying read, but those who have appreciated the subtlety with which Wilder weaves magic into her stories will find _The Wanderer_ to be blunt and heavy-handed by comparison.For those eager for a bit more of Wilder's Hylor, and curious to know ""what happened after"", this book does carry the overall story further and will not disappoint. For those who miss Wilder's elegant prose and slowly unfolded plots, this book cannot supply the lack."
2,Good looking shoes... a pain for your feet.,I wore them around the house to get used to them and they gave me a blister.
1,not correct picture!!!!!!!!,you do not receive the item in the picture. you will receive a different one with a blue and orange hollow handle. not as good racket. i am very upset. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!
2,Long past it's prime,"I use this one at work, still. But not by choice.This is a product which was programmed for a 16-bit operating system, and which is much more at home on it. Form package names are only supported in 8.3 DOS format.The largest fustration with this software is when working with a form, the font on the screen will jumble, forcing you to go back a page, then forward again to refresh the page.There are better form software out there, such as Acrobat, but I'm stuck using FormFlow."
5,WWHarveyD?,The character development in this show is great. The legal part of the show is only to provide context for great characters to develop and it makes law as a profession look enticing. The writing is tight and the dialogue is quick and witty. One of the best shows I have ever seen.
4,Great show,"This show is hip, interesting, and entertaining -- well-played by all. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) fits his role perfectly. I reserve 5 stars for MM. However, this series has gotten better & better with each season. Good legal plots mixed with personal stories and neither overdone. Rick Hoffman, who's been around a while, brings a swarmy, lovable, annoying tinge to the scenes - he is great. I love a good cop show (Southland) and then legal and then medical shows. Last week I fell asleep before the end of the show (work day was too much) so I had to stream it on the weekend to catch up!"
5,Great show!,Loved this and watching with amazon prime is easy. I recommend this. It is very convenient and also very fun.
5,Even better than I hoped,Suits just keeps getting better. I hope this series continues for many more seasons. I find myself even starting to like some of the characters that i loved to hate.
3,Suits Enjoyable but bordering on the Banal,"And yet another television series about the legal profession. The legal firm in question is a small partnership whose practice is exclusive to rich and powerful corporations or CEOs with the exception of the mandatory pro bono work. The ""twist"" is that one of the associates passed the bar without attending any law school, much less Harvard Law. The scripts are run of the mill, but Gabriel Macht, and the actress who plays the head of the firm have enough magnetism to rise above the scripts. Second lead, the young associate sans formal legal training is pleasant but IMHO lacks chops. The ""villin"" of the show, the attorney responsible for the care and feeding of new associates is ""Dishonest John"" without the mustache. The character is written way over the top, but the actor playing him is very watchable and skilled, he manages to make a ridiculous part seem credible, and his mobile features contribute immensely to making the show watchable."
5,Great cast of characters and writing,"All seasons of Suits have been worthwhile watching, and I don't watch TV programming in general so my thumbs up is an enthusiastic one. Clever writing and casting, smart and funny and there's only seldom anything cliche-ish. Wardrobing is terrific with lots of well-chosen designer ensembles--though the female characters are sometimes unrealistically seductively dressed for a law practice."
5,A Rare Treat For All,"This is one of the most beautiful musical scores I have ever heard. I have seen the film many times. Listening to the cd, brings back warm memories of watching, this enchanting movie. Doris Day has never been in better vocal form and is lovely to listen to. Stephen Boyd and Miss Day, have a wonderful chemistery. They are a treat to listen to, together. A note for Mr. Brogan who put a review on here. Stephen Boyd DID, do all of his own vocals His long time friend and publicist, was there to witness it. I have no idea where you got the idea, Mr. Brogan that it was not Mr. Boyd singing. He has a beautiful singing voice. This cd is a rare treat for all.Anita H. Wisconsin"
2,"Good sound, extremely poor durability","Good sound, good noise reduction (with a good bud fit), but horrible durability. I liked my first pair, but after a couple months, the wire started coming off the jack, rendering it useless. I ultimately bought a second pair (believing that I may have caused the cord issue through my habit of wrapping the cord around my hand to secure my ipod). And although I avoided the cord separation issue the second time around, again the sound started malfunctioning after 2 months. Sound fading in an out, one bud went dead, and finally it stopped working altogether.All in all, it's good while it lasts, but they've skimped on quality, durable materials. Certainly not worth the premium over cheaper earphones."
4,Great earbuds for the money,Very pleased with these earbuds. They sound great with good detail and ample bass. They come with several earpieces so it's easy to get a good fit and seal from outside noise. A bargain at the price!
1,Save your money,"Save your money. Look for another ear bud.Sound quality of two soup cans with string between them !Would return them, but not worth the hastle and expense."
2,Not for iPhone or iTouch,I found this searching for iPhone headset so I thought it would be supported. Although this works fine for my pc it DOES NOT work with iPhone or iTouch.
2,Disappointed,"Tiny sound and no base whatsoever. I bought it based on positive reviews and it did not live up to my expectation. Oh, well ...."
2,The best bang for the buck while it lasts...,"These headphones have really good sound quality, and are almost noise-canceling too. But, after a month of using them, one of the speakers began to randomly stop working and then start working again, and the next day both speakers started doing it until they both died completely. It was probably a defective pair, so if you decide on buying this, be warned that it probably won't last long."
2,WARNING - Do not buy if you are an active user!,I purchased these based on the other reviews on Amazon. The sound was clearly superior to the ear buds that came with my Sansa player. But they fell apart after about 9 months and no more than 25 uses.Bottom line - these are poorly constructed - I used them mostly while running so if this is your intention I cannot recommend them.
4,Very good fidelity!,"What I like about these headphones is the comfort. They come with ear pieces in various sizes; it was easy to find one that fit my ears well and didn't pop out easily. The cord is a good length to connect with my iPod in my pocket or on my desk. My son, a 17-year-old audiophile, was far more impressed by the sound quality than he had been by the more-expensive set he bought at the Apple store."
2,Only bass freaks need apply!!!,"These are way too heavy on the bass. I was expecting them to be bass heavy, but not at such of an expense to the rest of the spectrum; especally because of the good reviews here. There are entire parts of songs I can barely hear that normally stand out. Perhaps others are correcting with an equalizer, a true sign of bad earphones. Either that or people don't know what good earphones should sound like.For now I'll keep my Zune premium earphone which are so much better than these and use these for the gym."
3,V-MODA Earbuds Don't Last Long!!!!!,I had to replace these headphones after only six months. I've bought cheaper headphones from the grocery store that have lasted years. Improvements should be made to the manufacturing of these earbuds. I have seen similar complaints from other customers. V-Moda should do a better job!
1,Worst Ear Buds Ever,"I think these are the worst ear buds ever. I am amazed that so many folks supossedly rated them so high. I wasted $20, thank goodness I was not drawn in to pay full price. I would have based on the reviews. Someone needs to investigate who did the reviews. Muddiess bass I have ever heard. The ear buds that came with my Creative Lab Zen sound 100 times better. Waste Waste Waste. Take my word for it, do not waste you time or money."
2,Way too much bass!,These headphones are comfortable and well made but the sound is way too bass heavy for my taste. I guess that's how they're advertised but I expected a more versatile listening experience. I ended up buying a pair of JVC in-the-ear phones.
5,best headphones for the buck,"these headphones are great. they sound great. These headphones blew my ipod headphones out of the water. one piece of advice, if your mp3 player has a bass booster you won't need to turn it on with these headphones."
4,Great headphones...for the price,"I think I went in expecting a miracle product... but nevertheless, they're great headphones for the price. They seal out any exterior noise very well and sounds great for the price. You could get better sound quality with a different set, but you'd have to pay nearly $75 more. For an affordable alternative to prepackaged earbuds, these do the trick!"
4,Comfort at last,"Have owned an ipod for several years, never used the ear buds which came with it because they were too uncomfortable. These earbuds come in three sizes and are very confortable. I can now use my ipod when working out."
3,you get what you pay for,Was highly motivated by the reviews pertaining to its bass levels.but was left dissappointed by its actual performance.sounds distorted at high listening levels and the bass is only slightly better than regular ipod headphones.
4,Great for the price!,The V-MODA earbuds are very nice. Much better that the stock ones with the Ipod. The bass is an upgrade but I thought it would be stronger. The clarity more than makes up for it. I can understand the words of songs that before weren't that clear. They are very comfortable and stay in well.
1,broke in 45 days,"The sound is very good and they are comfortable, BUT mine broke in 45 days. I wore them daily with my iPod and they can't take the pressure of daily use. I didn't run with them, so they just faced the regular shock of walking around. They now fade in and out when I plug them in."
