1,Item arrived defective,Does not work out of the box. The compressor heats up but 24 hours later the kegerator has not cooled down.
4,Overall Good,"Overall quality is good, not excellent.PROS:1. Low Cost2. Holds full keg without issue.3. I don't know much about regulators, but the quality seems good.CONS:1. Castors work, but are cheap. I'm using them for now, but the casters don't feel like they will last long.2. Instructions were okay, but I would prefer more detail - for instance you need to make sure to install the rubber washer on the tap tower when mounting it on the fridge. The rubber washer is on the plastic insert that you can use for converting keg-o-rater to just a fridge. In order to install the rubber washer with tap tower you will need to lubricate the washer or it will not turn (I used WD40 with minimal effort).I'm happy overall and my wife even helped me make custom cabinets in the garage designed around the keg-o-rater."
2,get what you pay for,the first one i received came broken. we discovered it after an hour of putting it together. after taking it apart and repacking it we recieved the 2nd one. it is very wobbly and unstable. it is very cheaply made. do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a nicer model. i regret keeping it but after putting it together twice we didnt want to deal with the hassle of returning it.
4,Nostalgia KRS2100 Kegerator,"I bought the item on Thursday and received it on Friday, amazingly fast shipping.Very easy assembly.Had to adjust thermostat to get temperature colder, easily done by unplug unit, remove thermostat from the cabinet(2 screws) remove adjustment knob, and then remove two screws. Pull thermostat out of housing, there is a small phillips head screw above the temperature adjustment, turn screw 2 turns clockwise to make the temperature colder. Remount thermostat back on housing and attach to cabinet and plug back in and turn on. You may need to adjust a little to get correct setting. CO2 is best set at 5PSI to start. There is a small learning curve. First you must find the temperature you enjoy your beer at, once that is set you adjust your CO2. It isnt rocket science.Nothing like an ice cold IPA on tap!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,go jerry goldsmith,I recently purchased this cd and now have the complete Omen Trilogy produced by Varese. Of the three it's the first soundtrack The Omen that I can not listen to because of the erriness of it. That means Goldsmith was quite effective in accomplishing what he set out to do. The other two scores I can and do listen to. I find the score to the Final Conflict quite impressive. This score is also good and is a must for Jerry Goldsmith collectors. Way to go.
5,Buy in bulk!,"As a nervous first time mom I purchased one bottle of these to have on hand ""just in case"". I am now ordering them in bulk! Even my skeptical husband is stuffing these in our sons mouth when he has his middle of the night fits. Be aware that the teething tablets were recalled (something about inconsistant belladonna concentrations), but NOT the colic tablets (they do not contain any belladonna). For more info see the company website."
2,Not for Smith machines,"Very narrow opening, leaves a gap of 1-1/2 inches when used on a Smith machine's bar. Useless for any exercise that may cause it to roll. I'm sure the manufacturer saved a few pennies' worth of material, but it resulted in a useless product."
3,The Velcro portion sometimes catches my hair,"This item works great, most of the time. However, i found it annoying when the velcro portion catches my hair and it hurts when that happens. When it doesn't, it works great. It has sufficient cushion on my shoulder/back during my workout."
5,Great for the smaller diameter bars,"Great price, free shipping and works perfectly for the smaller diameter bars. Such a big difference on my shoulders! I have only had it a week so I cannot comment on the durability but I have had a Valeo belt for a few months and that is holding up well so I like the brand.I don't think it would fit too well on the bigger (olympic?) diameter bars because the velcro just touches on a standard size bar."
4,Just fine...,"I bought this item when I realized that my friend from the UK had left my old adaptor attached to her hair dryer when she departed for England. I was left with no means of plugging in my UK-bought computer and so hastily ordered the first adaptor I could find. Since it arrived I've been using it to power my computer, and it's doing just as well as my last one... It's an adaptor that does it's job, it's relatively cheap and you could do a lot worse."
5,Highly Recomended for lab purposes,"There is no better substitute for marking tubes, eppendorfs or mice, or at home for whatever boxes you may use"
2,Mostly useless to any EE,The style is pretty basic and bland. It provides not a whole lot of material.It could probably be condensed to a smaller text if it were more concise and instructive
5,diggit!,"Show is very entertaining! The places they go, the trouble they encounter, the hard work they put in, the back breaking labor, the appraisals, the rare relics that will disintegrate had they been left buried! Very humorous at times and just hearing the ""BOOM BABY"" line makes it worth it"
1,"not the fault of the provider, but what a lame show","what a boring show. i suppose i am not accurate rating the product as the delivery of the content online is fine, this is just a bad show"
3,not the brand name of Gamecube,"After I received it, not the brand name of Gamecube, it is a gamegear 64MB memory card for gamecube, so it cost only $10. But until now the quality is OK, no data lost since two weeks before."
5,One of our favorites.,"We love the ""cinderella"" stories from the different cultures. This one did not disappoint. Lovely story and illustrations. We recommend it, especially for girls."
5,Schoenberg was very wrong,"Composers have a tendency it seems to write one violin concerto (which becomes one of their best works). Stravinsky and Schoenberg are no exceptions to this. Schoenberg's concerto, he once bragged, would require a six fingered violinist. Michael Erxleben proves him to be very wrong. The performance he gives on these pieces is absolutely top notch - full of expressivity and, of course, virtuosity (duh). This is an album you must add to your collection - wonderful performances of two monumental 20th century works."
2,Not a Sista Souljah!,"This book was a poor attempt to try to explain the 90's woman. This book left me dry and sleepy. After the first chapter, I had to start reading from the index. The book was worse then it's cover."
1,horrible rip off,i bought these pens because i am a fashion designer and i love the way they work on designs. But i bought 24 pens and they sent me 2. and charged me 16 dollars for shipping which was ridicules and then are rude to me on the phone...after all of that they send me 22 batched pens but i dont even wanted to deal with it anymore!!! dont ever buy them bc its a total scam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Good Queen Bess up a tree?,"...not with Lady Susanna on the case. Kathy Lynn Emerson is one of the few true masters of the ""history mystery."" I flew through this book, and lost three pounds. That's because I skipped lunch AND dinner. NYT bestseller Tess Gerritsen says ""Lady Appleton is irresistible."" Edgar nominee Julia Spencer-Fleming calls it ""a honeyed comfit of murder, malice and manor houses. A must-read."" This is a book that lives up to the advance billing, folks. Now, if she would spend but a bit more time with Sir Francis Drake and the sea dogs...."
5,SuperWhy,"Good product, excellent for a two year old boy. Ontime shipment and arrived in excellent condition. I would reccomend this product to all parents with young children."
5,writes on everything but water itself,"Sharpies are the bomb. They are great for writing on CDs, stereo equipment, posters, footballs, plaster casts, you name it. Colorfast and waterproof, there is almost no surface they won't write on, other than water itself. Now available in these awesome vibrant colors, too!"
3,Read the descriptions carefully,"I had thought when I order this, this was a Disney ""Art of Book"" that would show development in the art of the film Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, it turns out that this was only a catalog of a lot of stills/frames of the film. It's not the seller's fault, I just need to read the descriptions more carefully next time."
2,So much for so little.....,While this porduct is helpful I can't believe that the cost is so high for such a tiny program. What a waste. The CD the program came on can hold over fifty more Lit guides and still have plenty of room. I just find the price for the material very one sided.The file may be useful but the profit margin is unbelievable.We should be getting more for the money.I don't plan on buying any more Teacher Pet products after reviewing these two titles.
2,Matchbox Car Size,I bought this toy for a 2 year old and thought from the photos it would be much larger. We got a good laugh when it arrived and is the size of a Matchbox car. It is also diecast instead of plastic. I should have looked closer at the discription and would have known it was small. So hard to be mad at Amazon as this is the first time I have been disappointed and I have learned to not make assumptions.
3,works,"Not neccessarily universal. Inexpensive yes. But only fits toilet bowls with a deep cover or a large toilet bowl as when flushing the flapper lever only works when cover is off. When cover is on flapper hit the top of the bowl and no flush. Wasted time, wasted money. Off to the nearest hardware store.Well 30 minutes later took another look and instructions said to use a hack saw which I did. Shortened the flapper. Works fine now. Knob is a little loose. Who knows maybe I'll get that later. Nice price though."
4,"Fun, A Real Page Turner but Not the Ending I Expected","I'm new to Paul Auster's brand of literature. I started with Timbuktu which I thought was brilliantly written. The Brookyn Follies takes the reader on one helluva of ride that is supposedly the main characters last hurrah in life. The story lines are fast and furious. You name the subject, this book has got it -- sex, cults, murder, homosexuals. I've gotta give Mr. Auster credit. He kept me interested until the very end. Maybe I missed it but without spoiling it -- I was disappointed with the ending. If you are looking for something different to read -- I highly recommend this book and all of Paul Austers novels. He writes no other. His creativity and imagination are unbelievable."
1,Bo-ring,"After reading the first 50 pages of this book, I'm calling it quits. It's hard for me to do, as I'm all for giving books a chance and I know sometimes books with slow beginnings can end up being great by the end. But, I feel this book is a waste of my time. I've never read an Auster book before and chose this one after reading some reviews of it. Life is to shore to spend it reading books that are boring. I'm moving on to another."
3,A year of journaling from a boring old man...,"I was so disappointed. This book was a mash of a few slightly interesting characters and a great premise that never delievered. I kept wanting Auster to give me something more outlandish or intriguing then the ideals of his nephew on Bush politics or a gay ex-convict (which was the most interesting thing in the book).Not a timeless piece you really are very clear the exact year it was written which is disturbing to me when reading a modern novel. However if you are an old man looking for an example of how to journal about your life for a year then I would suggest this book. Otherwise it just isn't worth the read. It wasn't horrible, just totally forgettable."
4,Excellent new recording of rarely heard score,Much has been written about the squabbles between Richard Rodgersand Stephen Sondheim when the musical was first produced. Theshow opened to lukewarm reviews and closed after about six months.The title song achieved some popularity and the cast recording waspleasant to listen to thanks to Sergio Franchi and Carol Bruce.This new recording is most welcome since Alyson Reed is outstandingas the female lead. The sound is excellent. Carol Lawrence doesa pretty good in the Carol Bruce role. Anthony Crivello is a finesinger but doesn't have the soaring tenor Franchi had so it is hard to see his appeal. Perhaps on stage he did better. Fynsworth Alley deserves praise for giving us a new version of the score and quite a nice one too.bad economic times.
5,Truly Superb!,"A great recording of this overlooked gem. I had the fortunate opportunity to see the George St. Playhouse production which was the forerunner of the Pasadena production and was thoroughly enjoyed by the scaled-down intimacy of this work. On this disc, most of the performers are a delight. There are some problematic moments with one of the singers, but overall, this recording is a treasure. The Richard Rodgers score is fine and the lyrics of (early) Steven Sondheim are clever. I highly recommend this album to the original, which was also first-rate ."
4,"Very Solid Album, great return for the gang from Minneapolis.","I Saw these guys for the second time live this past summer, first time was 10 years ago on their Dim Light tour, and they still rock. This album is their first in 7 years (candy from a stranger was their last). Still classic soul asylum, with excellent rock songs like ""Stand up and be strong"", and many others that slow the album down to a more acoustic feel. Yes, soul asylum is one of those 90's bands that had a monster album in ""Grave Dancer's Union"" and has had difficulty following its success, but hey, they are good. Fans, get this album if you don't already have it, its good solid rock. Enjoy. Also, they do have their Best of Twintone years out as well, with their more gritty fast punky sounding music on it, very different sounding from their stuff post Grave dancer's union."
1,Flame Tip Bulb,"The items were as described. They were shipped promptly and arrived before I expected them. However... 3 cards of these bulbs were put inside a box much larger than needed without any packing material or cushioning and shipped from New York to Alabama. There is no obvious damage, but as light bulb filaments are delicate by nature, I can only hope that the bulbs are still good. This was not an expensive product... but due care still needs to be taken. This was unprofessional. The company that shipped these is ""toolboxsupply"". FYI"
3,fine,The pens were fine. Haven't used them but they were thin and that's what was needed for the erasable calendar.
3,Just not enough game footage,"My 9 year old liked the various moves displayed in the video, but he wanted to see more of the moves being used by players in games."
3,"great recording, poor organisation of compilation",This is a great recording but it is exceedingly annoying that the lovely Piano Concerto in A No 23 is spread over two CDs
4,"good sound, bad logistics","I agree that attaching this type of pickup is awkward at best, but the quality of the sound is excellent for a pickup at this price (you really need a high quality microphone for true sound reproduction, which has its own issues). This price is very reasonable, but if you want to spend a little more Fishman also makes a model with a clamp-on 1/4"" jack that I imagine is much easier to use."
2,I don't like it,Is not a good product. You can find something better. Its hard to make that work fine. Its always with problems.
5,A Moving Experience,"I love these videos. While they're not ""mainstream famous,"" they are deeply moving. Bryn Yemm, a fabulous Welsh singer, gives us some of our favorite songs from the sites that probably inspired them. I especially love hearing him sing ""In the Garden"" from the Garden of Gethsemene."
1,Are you serious???,Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. With all of the hype for this piece of junk considered - it's defintely the most disapointing of all time.DOES ANYBODY REALLY ACT LIKE THESE GUYS IN REAL LIFE???? I hope not.....
2,Overrated,"I was eagerly anticipating this film...only to discover it was a huge letdown. The film has no plot, it doesn't work as a character study, or even a social commentary. It isn't funny, it isn't sad, it isn't savvy, it isn't snide... Frankly, it was just tedious. I would have given the film three stars, but the letdown from the hype subtracted a star. Other reviewers were right: it's just another buddy flick."
4,"Funny, Laugh out loud",This is a hilarious movie- nothing like I thought iy was gonna be. Fun for everyone!
3,Movie is great - Case was broken in two different places!,"The film itself is great! I don't often purchase movies, but it was an easy decision to add ""Sideways"" to my collection. However, the case itself was broken in two different places. Not a huge deal, and the movie seems to play fine, but it was disappointing to receive a damaged case."
2,stupid movie,"Not only stupid, but boring ... and I normally love chick flicks ... one bright spot was Sandra oh ... she's amazing !"
1,Empty-Headed and Mean Spirited,"My husband saw this movie on a plane, without the sex scenes, and thought it a funny movie. We rented it, and I was sickened by the way Thomas Hayden Church uses women and his best friend. This was a grown up version of a frat movie, with little on its mind but drunkeness and sex. Really awful to see a grown man act like morally bankrupt teenager."
1,I think someone played a trick on me,"Sorry but this was a complete waste of time for me. It came highly recommended by a freiend who previously has recommended some great movies (i.e. Sexy Beast and Cedar Rapids both get thumbs up). I am really surprised becasue it was so boring. He said I would be rolling with laughter. Now I get it - he is laughing for getting me to watch it.Looking at the reviews I guess you will either really like it or not. I kept watching waiting for something either intersting or funny to happen but it simply never does. So if your like me and are bored after the first 10 minutes, turn it off as it does not get any better."
4,More like 3 and 1/2,Most of this movie is very boring. I don't know what the problem is but most of the movie is just ruined by flat dialog that just seems to take all the energy out of what could have been a really great movie.The movie at the rare times that it does get genuienly funny is almost side splitting funny.Overall-Watch it but don't pay for the rental.
1,"All hype, no substance","I could not wait to see this movie, based on the previews and hype in the media. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the publicity generated by its well-oiled hype machine! This movie is not even mediocre.The two lead characters were absolutely pathetic, boorish, selfish losers. I did not need to see a movie about them and their drunkenness. They each needed to grow up and get a life.What made anyone think that a movie about two losers spending a week getting drunk and having sex was a good idea? Stupid stupid movie. Stupid plot (if you can call it a plot). Stupid idea."
5,Pleasent surprise,"I thought this movie was amazing and was appauled that it did not sweep the oscars. Paul Giamatti was a shoe in for oscar gold and deserved that oscar more than any other actor last year (I think that Foxx was a little too over-rated)...regardless though this film was just brilliant, touching and funny and just real all the way around. Thomas Haden Church was great as was Maddison and Oh, but nobody can touch Giamatti's drive in this film. I loved his charactor every minute he was on screen. The film is simple, plot wise that is, but the meaning it carries about love and life and friendship and relationships and starting over and or moving on from the things and experiences that weigh you down is endlessly moving. Great great movie!"
2,"""American Pie"" for middle-aged men",A neurotic loser and his boorish buddy trick women into bed on a week-long road trip to wine country. A depressing look at human ugliness all around.
3,"Just good, only worth a rent","Too much talk, sometimes gets really bored. But it has a good ending and the perform of Giannati is superb."
2,A comedy... or so I heard.,"I don't know if it's me, but I just didn't get this movie. I heard it was a buddy movie, a journey of discovery with laughs a-plenty along the way. Sorry, maybe I watched the wrong movie. I found both guys far too obnoxious to be likeable and while dislikeable characters can make a movie, they didn't in this case. As for funny? Not even a little snigger, let alone a big belly laugh anywhere in sight. I don't know what Rex Pickett's book's like, but this was very disappointing. I'm not a big fan of American Pie-style humor, but at least that did make me laugh, unlike this. Maybe I'm far less cerebral than I imagine and that's why I didn't get it. Or maybe this movie really is just garbage that people like because they've been told it's good because it ISN'T American Pie. Well, I know which I'd rather watch again."
2,Give men more credit please!,"This movie was so overhyped. Any one who writes a review here who says ""I know wine and I approve this movie"" is full of it. Those who work in the wine industry know about the meritage of the featured Pinot including Merlot, but aside from that piece of trivia the fact is, Merlot is a great varietal. It just got too popular, so this movie takes a cheap shot to make fun of it, and all of the people who enjoy it. Wine is not about being snobby and pretentious, it's about drinking wine that YOU you like.(It did a huge disservice to Merlot growers and winemakers by bashing it BTW). That's beside the point, however. The movie was just pathetic in it's interpretation of middle aged men. It had a few moments, but nothing to make up for the pain of having to watch these horrible characters for the length of the movie. Just sad and blah. It's obvious why Sandra Oh left that jerk."
2,I Must be Missing Something,"I was one of the many people who were very excited to see this DVD, having not being able to see this critically-acclaimed, award-winning movie in the theater.Now, I feel like I should start a support group for people who have seen the movie.I never considered myself a prude but the last 20 minutes of the movie were just too much for me. It may be worth seeing just for the shock value.Also, if you are the type of movie goer that enjoys the ""happily ever after"" ending, don't even BOTHER to watch this movie, you will be disappointed.That said, all of the main actors give wonderfully believable performances and the wine country setting is very engaging.I just wish the last twenty minutes were more satisfying and less shocking."
4,sidways,I enjoyed the movie. This movie should be watched on a rainy Saturday afternoon with your spouse/girlfriend/boyfriend.
3,a so-so movie with so-so storyline and,"so-so directing, screenplay, editing. the whole movie is actually quite boring and contrite. there's nothing too excited about it, just a so-so mediocre story. best supporting actor? nahhh. sitting and watching it, felt a bit suffocated and have to surpress yawns all the time. pretty luke-warm, very forgetful."
3,A modest and unpretentious vintage,"""Sideways,"" the first comedy (well, dramedy) to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture in recent memory, is in serious danger of being overhyped. Viewers will come to it expecting ""one of the best films of the last decade"" or a ""hilarious"" film and be disappointed, which is a shame, because the modest charms it actually has are quite engaging.To wit: This is a film that substitutes quiet charm for laugh-out-loud jokes, wry observations for deep insights into the human condition, and a mellow rambling pace for a plot that pulls the characters (or viewers) along. It is more a mellow afternoon spent at an out of the way winery than it is a glitzy event of a movie.This is definitely worth a rental, but do not go in expecting to have your life changed by ""Sideways."" And, frankly, thank goodness for that. If only more Best Picture nominees were created by film makers content to make a satisfying film, instead of a religious experience."
2,"More ""up-side-down""","Preposterous storyline (two beautiful women with such ""losers"") and some of the most ""flat"" direction I have seen in recent memory. To think that so many so-called critics have simply fallen all over themselves to rave about this film (and to add final insult to injury) that it was nominated for Best Picture is just ludicrous. The writing is contrived, the execution of the film is mediocre, and the only saving grace is some very good (but certainly not great) acting by the principals, but in the end, not enough to merit spending two hours with something so terribly mundaneas this stupid story - what a waste!"
3,ok,I thought this movie was ok.It did have some funny parts in the movie but also i thought it had no point to the movie.All it had was 2 guys wanted to find some girls to have sex with.Jack(Thomas Haden Church)cheated on his fiance' for someone.The only reason why i put 2 was because it had some funny scenes.
5,"Good Wine, Good Times","I was told before viewing by my 52 year old uncle that I probably wouldn't like ""Sideways"" because I'm only 28 years old, he concluded that I should wait a few years before seeing it so I could fairly access it. Well, I'm proud to say that he couldn't have been more wrong, I absolutely love this movie. I love the calm, relaxed vibe of it, it makes the bizarre, over the top scenes (too many to mention!) stand out that much more. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church have a level of chemistry that I can't remember seeing on film since...well, ever maybe, I'd love to see them do the Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder thing. Their chemistry is also evident off film as well, the DVD commentary track is almost as good as the movie, they really do seem like 2 guys who genuinely enjoyed working together. I recommend this to any and everyone with at least a normal IQ level, lol, you will not be disappointed I promise.Reply"
5,The Actors Commentary is Hilarious,"This movie is a gem, and much has been written about the content of it. However, the commentary by Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti is hilarious, and eloquent. I listen to most of the commentaries on my DVD's and this is one of the best. One of my favorite Giamatti comments is when he calls Haden Church a ""young Lee Marvin.""In some ways it's a metaphor for modern America - one character having a brash, and blatant disregard for others, while simultaneously expounding that it's really all going to be ok in the end.The other character is quietly going about his business, standing steadfast to the morals he really believes in, but is powerless in being able to stop the determined, and misguided oaf."
2,I say it's merlot and I say to hell with it!,"What exactly is supposed to be so witty and charming about this ""little"" film, which is primarily ""little"" in maturity? The lead is a failed writer stuck teaching creative writing to bored high-schoolers and would've been a sympatheic character if he hadn't decided to steal money from his mother's bedroom early on in the film (the only thing his mother seems to be guilty of is putting up with her son's rude, dishonest behaviour). His buddy is about to get married but decides that it's his right to go on spree of getting laid as much as possible before exchanging his vows. They're both losers in every sense of the word and yet we're supposed to be amused and empathetic with them because they're so clueless. Wrong! That this even remotely got consideration for Oscars in any catagory is a sad commentary on the dreary state of American film today."
2,weary blues,"I'd rather be hog-tied and left for dead rather than sit through this again: unpleasant losers stumbling upon some kind of ""meaning."" In graduate school, I spent enough time around people like our two protagonists; I don't want to see a movie about them. The only thing more annoying than this sappy valentine to ""male bonding"" is the director's previous film, ""About Schmidt."" Oy! There's a pompous, condescending, spiritless melange of cheap sentiment, facile insight and self-congratulatory ""humanity."" Worse than this swill-fest, but just barely."
4,Foodies' paradise,"I'm a foodie who reads cookbooks for fun and relaxation in addtion to using them to feed friends and family. This book is a multi-discipline delight. The art work, the music-to-cook-by suggestions, the actual recipes. Ah, yes, the actual recipes; a bit labor intensive for my day-to-day tastes, and some of the ingredients are hard to come by in Cajun country, but on the whole, a sensory delight."
4,Massage Time,"I am fortunate enough to have a massage therapist come to the house once a month~ I try and keep a well-stocked CD collection of ""massage music""~ this CD fit the bill perfectly!"
4,Rare Eloquence,"Numerous cellists - including Casals, Rostropovich, Fournier, Starker, Bylsma, Maisky, Wispelwey, Linden, Pergamenschikow, Schiefen, Schiff, Onczay, Gendron, and the ubiquitous Yo-Yo Ma - have recorded the complete Cello Suites.Inexplicably, only two of these performers - Rostropovich and Gendron (on the present recording) - seem able to maintain the flow of the music without constantly interrupting the rhythmic pulse with overblown rubato. Between the two, Gendron is perhaps more risk-averse in his approach, reaching fewer emotional highs but nevertheless giving a vigorous and wonderfully fluid performance across the board."
3,Gourmet,"It's a nice book, just not something that I would reach for when looking for a new recipe. If you are a gourmet cook, then this book is for you."
1,Burning eyes,"Burnt my eyelids, swollen eyes, pretty painful. Took 4 days for my eyelids to get back to normal size, but the skin still hurts. Makes me look 10 years older!!!"
2,Terrible book! Poorly written and organized.,"I am currently enrolled in a ""Data Structures and Alogorithms in Java"" course and this is the book we are using. This book is NOT a good book in any way, shape, or form. The book provides very little code to follow up explanations, lacks organization and flow, and is difficult and confusing to read. Some of the more important topics such as exceptions, staques, and queues are just a few pages long and do not thouroughly explain the purpose of such ADT's. A significant part of the book deals with complex mathematical algorithms that are of no concern to someone just starting out in data structures.I would highly recommend looking into another book dealing with the topic of data structures, such as those by Weiss, Waite, or Main. Even the teacher for my class would not use this book again!"
2,You can find much better than this...,"Kinda going off what other reviewers have said, the book has a lot of typos, the code samples are hideous to look at (one-character variable names everywhere, hooray). Indeed the book is similarly confusing to a poorly written Calculus textbook in that, you get the feeling that the author just likes to write a lot and not actually explain anything all that well. I had a Data Structures class based on this book and its pretty safe to say people did their learning with the instructor and tried to avoid the textbook as much as possible. If this is required for a class, I can understand buying it, but if you're doing self learning (then first of all why are you buying a paperback) you can find far better resources than this book."
1,epitome of a waste of paper,"I am taking a beginning course in algorithms this semester at Purdue and I have to conclude that nobody is learning anything from this book. Everybody I talk to here thinks the book is terrible (contradicting what a previous reader from purdue thought). The code is very useless and could be implemented in much better ways. They don't even explain what they are doing in their code! I also found the explaination of induction and big O notation to be patheticly short since that is a big part of the course. A book like this should focus more heavily on this and analyzing different loops to make a determination of their running times in functions. The main point of any book in cs is to provide real programming projects and take the reader through the development of them. This book glosses over very important topics like the ones I mentioned and seems to make it a goal of trying to confuse the reader. In short, there are much better books on this subject."
2,Way too stiff,I bought this for dog washing. It was too stiff for any use like that. Formable would be a better description than Flexible.
1,Piece of Junk,"This radio is totally useless. You tune in a station, and it comes in very clear......until you turn your head to the left or right, then it fades in and out. I know that it has nothing to do with where I'm located because I have used several different models, and have never had this problem before. I returned the unit to Amazon."
5,Great radio,"I received my headphone radio in just 9 days. It arrived in perfect condition.The radio is just what I wanted, light weight, great sound quality for a cheap unit. It picks up more stations than any of my larger radio's. For the price its one the best bargains I ever bought.Amazon was great and the dealer Kramnedlog was great, I will buy again."
1,junk,"product is junk, I thought it was a sony knock-off. Worth $10 at most. My advise, save your money. Junk junk junk"
5,Perfect,My husband has been using this particular model for many years - he runs 3 miles every other day without fail! We were unable to locate it locally but found it on AMAZON! It is perfect for him!
3,Overpriced?,I paid $85 for this used and it seems a bit much I would look around I listen to it at work and don't like wires and ear bugs. I like analog cause I'm a techy idiot.
2,not the best reception,"unfortunately the SONY SRFH4 sports am/fm headband radio gets lousy AM reception and for that reason i cannot recommend the product. i bought it exclusively for use while riding my bicycle but for that purpose it has three things against it: the on/off switch is in an awkward position, the headset is not all that comfortable and as aforementioned the unit gets lousy radio reception...if i can ever find a piece that gives me good quality in those (3) areas i'm sold."
2,"Lots of Examples, not step by step","I have been writing C/C++ programs for a long time, and I bought this book looking to go from console programs to graphical interfaces. I would not recommend this book for someone in this position. It has basic descriptions of various MFC classes and what they do, but not exactly how to use them. There is a gap between explaining the classes, and the examples, as the examples are complete programs that uses many classes put together.For example, dialog boxes and control classes are described in Chapter 2, but the first example PROGRAM is in Chapter 5, after drawing, messaging, etc. I would have liked the book to say ""Here is this drawing function, and this is how you intialize all of the MFC stuff to be able to use it."" In fact, the book is more like ""here is a list of drawing functions, some are used in Example X on page Z.""I suspect this book would be useful for a somewhat experienced MFC programmer but I wouldn't buy it as your first foray into MFC."
1,Great For Programmers Who Enjoy Wasting Time,"Sometimes the author shows the code you need to create a certain result and where to put it. Sometimes he does not. You have to do a lot of second-guessing when you read this book. I even tried looking through the CD to see if I could get the source code in context with the example application--na da, zip! Some of the code is outdated. If you are using Visual Studio 6 or later, forget this book. You will have tons of error messages. This is not the author's fault. This is the fault of those pointy-headed pinheads at Microsoft. They actually think changing the names of classes and functions is some sort of upgrade(lol). The book would be a lot better if it started with a simple application and expanded on that application showing where all the little code snippets go in the source files and how they work. Wouldn't that be nice?"
4,Go Patriots!!!,"I will never forget that idiot receiver on the Rams who declared prior to their Super Bowl v the Patriots (the Pats' first championship) ""tonight a dynasty is born."" He was of course referring to his own Rams who were going for their 2nd/3rd championship. Little did he know how right he was, but he was talking about the wrong team. That night a dynasty was born as the Pats (not the Rams) won 3 of the next 4.This DVD is just the most recent chapter in the dynasty. Recommended for any Pats fan."
1,Thumbs down to Wingnuts and Freeverse Software,"Despite what Freeverse software says, this game is not compatible with OSX. They released several patches/downloads on their Website, but I tried them all and it didn't fix the problem. I contacted them about this and asked for a refund. They agreed to refund money, but I have been waiting for several months, and no refund yet! There are numerous complaints about this game on their own message board and it seems like if you are very lucky and try to reset your monitor to a different display size, maybe it works. I tried all these ridiculous fixes and none of them worked. Plus, the game is a super basic shoot and dodge. Not worth it. Major thumbs down."
3,A generally good Berlioz collection,"This recording is good generally, but the Symphonie fantastique really disappoints. The recording would be great if the LSO sound more 'fantastique'(you will konw what I'm talking about if you listen to the Concertgebouw/Davis recording by DECCA). Despite the disappointing Symphonie fantastique, I still like Colin Davis' ""Harold in Italy"" and the overtures, his poetry-like expressions and passion is perfectly suitable for Berlioz.However, taking its price into consideration, I would not hesitate to reccomend this recording to those who want to try Berlioz."
3,Not Worth the $100 + people try selling it for.,"People must be F*uckin' crazy, trying to sell a single dvd for $100 to $200 on ebay, Amazon and other places on the net. If your like me just copy the Original LIVE PPV from VHS to DVD will save you a TON of money."
2,tape in a bottle,When I ordered the tape it was for 3 bottles and they sent me 2 bottles the packing list said 3 but there was only 2 so now I'm a little scared of about ordering on line. thank you Mary Vie
5,WONDERFUL - if only it was available,"As a highly active amateur cellist, this is my signature baby gift to all friends and family - all have commented at it's soothing effect when played at naptime or bedtime. This is a wonderful collection, well-played - BUT IT'S NEVER AVAILABLE. I'm now on a constant search to find used copies. I can only hope that they get back on the ball and restart production on this CD - so that all of you can enjoy it!!"
2,....What no Pat Boone..?..The Music That Killed Radio..!,..To much white bread radio for me..I Cherry picked the best and burned two good cd's outta this mess..Then gave the set away.
5,Beautiful...,"The ultra fine point allows you to draw and take notes with the marker. High quality, as with all Sharpie products!Box of 12 means that you get a great value for the price, and ensures that you will always have more Sharpies to draw with!I never leave home without one :)"
4,Quite nice,"In my home, I am always misplacing pens. I bought the twelve pack of the Sharpie precision point markers to always have a good pen that produces a crisp, clean line within my immediate reach.These precision markers will bleed through notebook paper and lighter printer paper, however, for my purposes, this is fine. For signing letters printed on one side, checking off lists, and marking boxes with their list of the contents, these work great. Each of the 12 units was usable; I didn't find one pen to be dried out.One disclaimer is that the user needs to be sure to firmly press the cap onto the pen base. The caps do not slide on as easily as I would like and require a little extra push.These pens are assembled in the United States."
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,EVERY SINGLE MARKER WAS DRIED OUT AND DEAD. COMPLETELY USELESS. DO NOT BUY AND IF YOU DO SAVE YOUR PACKAGING SO THAT YOU CAN SEND IT BACK
5,Great product for a great price,"I have always liked sharpies and these are no exception. I ordered because of Amazon's great price at the time. The sharpies are in perfect working condition (not dry, or old)."
1,"Not Howl, Just Hype","This book is full of poorly written essays backed only by the authors' direct ties to the beat generation.Instead, buy this book (""Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript, and Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author...""), which is cheaper and very very interesting to those fascinated by Howl and Ginsberg, or even just the poetic process.""Howl Fifty years later"" was a great disapointment for me."
2,Find the original!,"As a teacher with dry erase boards all over my room, I've used Expo markers extensively for many years. I work for a government agency, and we sometimes use the cheapest source for markers. I recommend Expo over any off brand we've used. There's simply no comparison. I write constantly the entire time I'm teaching, and Expo is the only brand that can keep up.However, the newer ""low odor"" markers can't compete with the originals. The original markers might carry a strong odor, but they last at least three times as long. I do like the bullet tip over the original chisel tip. It gives someone who's writing a lot extremely rapidly a lot less trouble. The chisel tip gets annoying because it doesn't provide a consistent line. I have to constantly erase and fix skinny lines. The bullet tip is nice.The ""low odor"" will cost you at least twice as much and probably three or four times as much, though. They don't last very long."
1,"Would be good toilet paper, but the pages are too stiff","This book is used as the text book for my college course. The examples are ridiculous, the exercises are nuts, and the definitions are strange. ""This book is not intended to be read in sequence, from beginning to end."" (from the book's introduction) Maybe the book isn't meant to be read at all. There is better information from O'Reilly and Cisco. Search for ""firewall"" on O'Reilly's site and you'll get better information than whats in this book and you'll save $75. Get ""The Best Damn Firewall Book Period"" instead of this, Amazon sells it for $37 and it gets 4 stars."
2,Jam???? Tuesday????,"THIS is definitely an acquired taste; you either ""get"" this stuff, or you don't. ""Rex the Runt"" is lunatic, stream-of-consciousness humor, involving four clay-mation dogs. The stories don't make any sense at all, and they're not meant to; they ramble wildly from one inside-joke plot line to the next. It took me several episodes to get into the weird sense of humor in this series, and some of the jokes become funny through repetition....for instance, Rex's sidekick, ""Vince"". (He likes jam, Tuesdays, and has Random Pavarotti Disease; he breaks into a brief operatic interlude at the slightest provocation. Oh, and did I mention he falls over a lot??) Just go into this with the knowledge that it's screwball and non-sensical, and you just might enjoy it. Definitely not for the serious-minded."
2,I guess it protects but it doesnt look all that great (bubbles),"I guess this protects the PS3 from any minor scratching which is good for preservation purposes, but dont expect it to look good. Unless you're a professional cover expert this thing bubbles the second you put the protection on. Its fine, I dont care how the thing looks, I just want it protected. But just beware."
4,Worthly Addition to the Sharpe Saga,"Sharpe's Skirmish by Bernard Cornwell is good addition to the Sharpe Series of books. It shows our hero ,Richard Sharpe, doing what he does best, winning over great odds. Thank you Mr. Cornwell for another great read."
5,Definitely check out this title if you're Ecudaor bound!,"This book, dare I say, bests Lonely Planet all around. The husband-wife team has been wandering the backroads of Central and South America for more than a decade, and their grasp of local culture shows on every page. Like other Open Road guides, this title appeals to budget, real-world travelers; if you read Big World, you'll probably enjoy their titles immensely."
3,Pathetic weak little thing,"I just receive a 5"" tall dry stem sitting in a 3"" pot. The only green occurs on a 2"" long leaf that looks none too healthy. I will do my best the nurse it, of course, but the vendor really should be honest with the description.======================== Added 10/22/2011 =======================The one I bought last year was nursed back to health after 6 months, but a mishap in the summer killed it. I just ordered 4 more. They are much bigger and healthier than last year's. After leaving them to rest for 2 days, I replanted them to 6"" pots and noticed that the root system looked quite healthy. It is definitely a good buy if the vendor can maintain the size and the quality."
2,NOT really Macintosh compatible,"I bought this game after seeing that is was MAC compatible. Once it arrived we realized it is only works for MAC version OS 9, which isn't even around anymore. The way this product is listed is very misleading. Wish my son could use this, but we only have Macs here. Must be why the price is so low. I bought this about a month ago for $12, now it's $4"
1,Terrible!,this game messes up the configuration of the entire pc my son loves it but i had to return it because the cd spins so loudly it got him too upset so it had to go back. i also had reformat everything on the desk top which is annoying and its not worth the trouble.
3,JPEG image viewing is very Dodgy,"I bought this Plasma TV and it it Great, EXCEPT that I cannot view any JPEG images. What a hassle I went through buying dirrerent memory cards and PC card adapters only to find out that it will not display standard jpeg images and only specific images straight out of certain cameras. I have an older Minolta Digital Camera and these images do not conform, hog-wash. If you want to change the images in ANY way before showing them, red-eye, color balance, contrast, etc., it will not display them either.I have found the same issue is true for their DVD Recorders as well; no jpegs except from specific cameras."
5,Excellent Novel about Clodia and Catullus,"This novel, which I first read back in 1965, is excellent and powerful. Its candid look at the corruption of Rome is impressive and reminds us very much of the present (""the government's words are lies""), and its delineation of Catullus' love for Clodia is intense and heartbreaking. I cried at the end. Of course I was only 20 years old at the time. I don't cry when I read it now, but.... The scene when the crowd calls for the elephants in the arena to kill their hunters is overwhelming."
5,God's Promises for Your Every Need(Spanish edition),"This topical Bible reference book(in English)has been invaluable to me for many years since I have been in the ministry. My wife teaches a Spanish Sunday School class and asked me if it were also available in Spanish. I was very pleased to discover that it was. In addition to being a great source of comfort, I have also found it to be a great tool for counseling. Rather than relying on much of the politically correct PSYCHO-BABBLE generally accepted, I consider it much better to see what God has to say!!!"
4,Overall it's great except for the Eraser.,"The spray is great for getting off all the old marker markings on a white board. Once the bottle runs out which can be pretty quick, I usually just pour in 90% rubbing alcohol which works great. The markers work as they are supposed to they write well I use them once a week to write on a board for game releases so they last a nice amount of time for me but for others I think if your writing a lot everyday there is a good possibility for them to run out in a quick/ reasonable amount of time. Only complaint is the board eraser it just absorbs the old markings and can spread those markings later in time. Even though it is meant to be basic it feels extremely cheap. I just use a paper towel to clean up my white board. Bought this for 9 bucks, if you already have the bottle I suggest getting the markers separately keeping the bottle and using a paper towel for erasing the board."
3,"Works, but isn't the best out there.","The eraser is the worst part of the set. It is made of cheap ""styrofoam"" kind of stuff and is too light. It seems it might just break if you apply force on it, obviously I haven't tried that! The pens are okay. These have a chisel tip. I personally prefer bullet time so that you can write in the same flow from every angle. But that isn't too big a problem. The ink lasts pretty long.t"
4,Best personal finance software out there...,I never appreciated Microsoft so much until I started shopping around for an alternative due to it's it near future discontinuation. The only software that was not web-based that seemed to be a reasonable alternative was Quicken 2010. I used it for about a month but I was really unhappy with it so I went back to Money 2007. I now realize what a good piece of software this is....Really wish Microsoft would rethink getting out of this market.
3,dont buy this!!,dont buy this!!waste of your money. may be good for 20 bucks.lots of features but not easy to work with.
1,Excel suits me better,I really need more help with visualizing my budget and seeing cash flows. MM doesn't seem to be as flexible as I'd like and it rarely gives me visual options. The visual options they do have are too plain.
3,"high quality, very comfortable, too big...","i received it 2 weeks ago, and i am using it with my glock 26.i found it very comfortable on the leg, sits still and high quality.But i can hardly take it out (drawing) with my Levi's 505, which does not have boot cut, but regular/straight fit. take it into account before buying."
4,My favorite Elric so far,"I'm currently reading _Stormbringer_ so I can't say anything about that book but this is my favorite Elric book out of the other 7. It's not as pulpy because it was written as a novel, not as short episodes for a magazine and the gypsy caravan was absolutely ingenious. Rose was cool too."
3,A little more revenge would have been nice...,"The latest installment of the Elric series by Moorcock, ""Revenge"" sadly lacked some elements that made the original Elric saga so interesting. I love the entire series, but was a little dissapointed by this book. For one, it's all talk for at least 90 pages. By then, even Elric is itching to draw his blade, which hasn't been done much yet either. Finally, a little action comes when pirates try to raid the ship Elric's on in the Heavy Sea, but even that battle is short lived. More philosophy follows and it isn't until page 202 out of 244 that the nitty gritty starts happening. Newcomers to the saga should start at the beginning and then maybe they'll be alright reading this one. I'm happy there's more Elric, but Moorcock could have done better."
4,"New Soldier, New Politician","Insight into the real John Kerry and his feelings towards America and the US Veteran. Cover is very illuminating, a gang of hippies mocking the Iwo Jima heroes with a raising of an upside down American Flag. Kerry has been trying to quash this book for years and it's not surprising that amazon doesn't have a picture of the cover. I'll gladly supply one if they really can't find it. This is a must read for 70's historians, however most of the involved group (Vietnam Veterans Against The War) have been found to be not actual combat veterans, some not even veterans. Kerry's original ""band of brothers"" turns out to be a bunch of socialist agitators, so at least he keeps consistent company. For the real story of Kerry's wartime service read ""Unfit For Command"". At least the veterans involved in that book can tell the same story through the years without embellishments or fictionalizing."
4,Great shows but no extras,"If you haven't stumbled across ""The Fugitive"" yet, do so. It still gets my vote for the best show ever on television. Incredible writing, sharp direction and a distrust of authority that never goes out of style all combine to make this 1960s show just as good in the 2000s as when it first appeared.Now for the problem: No extras. This is a shame since some were available. One VHS version of the shows included introductions by Barry Morse, who played the lieutenant forever pursuing the wrongly convicted Dr. Kimble. Why weren't these included?Also, considering how influential and timeless this show was/is, I'm sure there's no shortage of TV historians who could've done great commentaries, perhaps Ed Robertson who wrote the 30th anniversary companion book to the series (if he's still alive). It's a shame there are no extras but at least it's finally on DVD. Here's hoping future sets get better treatment."
5,"Great writing ,acting and tension throughout.",My wife and I were re-introduced to The Fugitive back when it was on A&E.; Very pleased with the quality of the video and the sound. Like most here so glad it is finally released on DVD. There is so much garbage out there its obviously tough to find something even near this quality. Even the very 1st episode was excellent; which is rare in a new TV series. Brian Keith's performance...wow!Hopefully purchasers spread the word so enough folks keep buying these to get all episodes on DVD where they belong.
5,"The Fugitive - Season One, Vol. 1",I received this ahead of scheduled arrival and I was very happy to receive it in such good condition. I am planning to give it as a gift and would definitely buy from this seller again.
3,Quite a creepy film,"There were a times between a few hokey special fx scenes that I caught myself wondering ""Why am I watching this ?"". Because 'Beyond Dream's Door' has so much more to offer in suspense, creepiness, and atmosphere. The entire film made me feel as though if had a larger budget, it could have ranked up there with 'A Nightmare on Elm St' as another heavyweight horror film of the late 80s. It is truly that stylish. Many of the visuals were inspired works of art in their own right which left me guessing where reality stopped along the way. Sure, there is some flat acting which only enhances the film in a bizarre David Lynch-like manner, but that became part of the appeal. I'd recommend this gem to any horror fan not looking for the typical 'Friday The 13th' bloodbath."
2,"Close, but no Cigar!","A respectable independent effort that just doesn't quite work. The dream concepts are interesting, confusing, as well as jarring at first. However the film is nowhere near coherent or well-constructed enough to maintain what could've been an interesting hook. Sell out and watch an Amenabar or Shamalon film instead-otherwise investing 90 minutes in this will just result in boredom and restless irritation."
3,Rutles 2 is just OK,"Sorry to say Rutles 2 was just OK, it had quite a few funny moments, but is not the piece of art that the first one was. Kind of a shame. I find myself wishing he didn't do it. But there was alot of unseen footage from 77-78, obviously the outtakes, and were outtakes for good reason...And they did not take the opportunity to use any new footage of, say, the reunion in NYC a few years back, but they did include some new songs from Archaeology...oh well...Jimmy Fallon is terrible, why do people like him??? Almost all the new interviews were stupid, but Steve Martin was excellent, and I liked Robin Williams although he didn't speak about Rutles, he was just insane is all. Catherine O'Hara was pretty good as Astro Glide the photog. I think this whole thing could have been done much better, however, and covered much more new territory. I don't think it was worth the wait or the trouble of begging for its release. But Dirk on Ed Sullivan was worth the price of admission alone!"
2,"HORRIBLE...BUT, STILL, IT'S THE RUTLES!","I'm dispatching this DVD to the nether reaches of my video collection. It is doubtful that I will ever watch it again. However, the few brief pleasures it gave me does warrant two stars, given rather reluctantly, for nostalgic reasons only. Otherwise, this is an outrageous ringing of the cash register and a tarnishing of the original's reputation."
1,Printing Problems,Beware this edition - at least until the printing problems are resolved. I bought two copies and each copy duplicated pages 85-116 and did not include pages 117-148. Amazon has not yet provided replacements so I wonder if all its print run of this edition is affected in the same way.
4,One star off for not containing the Colors of Chloe,Excellent primer to Eberhard Webers 30 years (?) with ECM. Sound quality is way above the normal ECM product as these Rarums are remastered. Now if they would just go back and remaster Pat Methaney's Bright Size Life. Kudos.
3,The Break Up,"The shipper was speedy and had fantastic communication, however quality of movies is rather poor, almost seemed as though it were a bootleg"
2,Too Much Reality!,"I've had terrible luck with love, but that doesn't mean I want to watch a movie about how much it sucks! This is also not a funny movie at all. It's just depressing."
2,Too Much Yelling & Arguing,There is just way too much fighting and arguing in this movie. It had such potential.
3,BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,"This is a great rainy Saturday movie. I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Aniston because she is always, well, Jennifer Aniston. But that works for her. The same thing with Vince Vaughn - he's the big goof in comedies and eerily frightening in dramatic vehicles. But, together, they make a nice team with believeable chemistry. They are nicely supported by Jason Batement and Jon Favreau. Vincent D'Onofrio is a chameleon, barely recognizeable as the over-analytical detective in television's ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"". The plot here is a lot less violent than ""The War Of The Roses"", but telling the same story in a more civilized and delightful manner. The ending was perfect, leaving the viewer with the sense that there's room for a sequel. Hopefully, that will never happen, but we can just follow Aniston's real-life workaholic/on-again-off-again romances/friendships/""friends-with-benefits""/booty calls/boyfriends-of-the-week/still trying to get over Brad and Angelina/ saga."
2,Nobody Does Vince Vaughn Like Vince Vaughn,"Does Vince need a script or is this the way he is in real life? Of course, Jennifer Aniston is cute and easy on the eyes and in this film she is the girlfriend with a job at a foo foo art gallery in Chicago.Vince's Gary Grobowski is a 100% Polish tour guide who has way too many ball games to go to and watch and video games to play to get involved with someone like Jennifer's Brooke. What do they have in common? Not much, except somehow they fell in love. What do they see in each other? I am not sure.There are some funny scenes (a few with Vince and Jon Favreau, these guys have some chemistry) and cute moments - but, where's the beef? Who cares if Gary and Brooke live happily ever after? Not me."
2,The Break-suck,"This movie was pretty bad. Particularly the ending. I have never been to a movie where the whole audience showed such a disgusted recation. The second the credits began to roll at the end, the whole audience in the theater I was at went ""OH!"" And people walking out were really upset by the ending. I wont say how it ends, for the sake of everyone who will wase 20 something on this film, but just prepare to be disappointed. I don't know about everyone else out there, but I go to a movie to forget about my problems and forget about fighting and bickering. This film brought just that, and it was a very irritating experience."
4,"5 stars for a Comedy, 4 stars overall","My girlfriend has made me watch every Jennifer Aniston movie, and I felt this was her best role and best performance by far, as she seemed very comfortable in this kind of character, and the chemistry between the cast was very good. I found Vince Vaughn hilarious, especially playing all of those video games. I enjoyed it. My girlfriend said it reminded her a bit of the War of the Roses movie. At the end they tease you with a sequel in which they get back together."
1,Don't be misled,"This is a terrible movie, totally misrepresented on the package as a good date movie. If your idea of a good date movie is to watch people tearing into each other and addicted to the pain, by all means go for it! The whole premise was absurd from the beginning and I couldn't bear to watch the middle of the film. I did watch the ending, just to see how it came out and was sadly disappointed that it sort of trailed off and left me as unsatisfied as the beginning did. No real resolution. I like closure in a movie, and this one simply did not satisfy on any point. A real waste of Jennifer Aniston, and a totally mismatched cast. Yuck!"
3,Art imitates life,"A couple break up and continue to live together in a condo because both refuse to move out. A few funny moments, but overall a flat movie. The lack of chemistry on screen explains why they broke up in reakll life. Just like in the movie, he is a simple every day guy and she is a diva. Didn't hate it, but not great."
4,A second helping of puzzles,"I need to thank my friend, Vivian Lee, who sent me as gifts both books, Kakuro Challenge 1 and Kakuro Challenge 2. I have already reviewed Kakuro Challenge 1, and Kakuro Challenge 2 is very similar . Once again one gets a generous helping of 200 kakuro puzzles, ranked in four categories of difficulty. The layouts and difficulty are about the same as in Challenge 1. As you follow your way through the puzzles you will soon find yourself back in old familiar places, such as the intersection of 7-in-3 block with a 4-in-2 block and the friendly attraction of an 11-in-4 block intersecting a 14-in-2 block.When Alastair comes out with a third kakuro challenge, let us hope that he corrects the last paragraph in the introduction, adds some more advanced hints about using subsets of numbers, and widens the range of puzzle layouts."
3,I had more fun with Pirates Gold on the Sega Genesis,"This game was very ok. The missions are kind of boring. The sounds are not up to par in my book. Pirates Gold on the Sega Genesis was a far superior game. If you are expecting a game where you get to wreak terror on the high seas than look somewhere else. Go buy a genesis and get Pirates Gold, now that's a pirate game."
3,cheap mic,"Here's an example of you get what you pay for. It works, but doesn't sound particularly good."
3,Better than expected,"I just got it in the mail today, i thought for $15 it wouldn't be so great but it works like a charm. the mic works great i haven't been too far away from it but i haven't noticed any delay. my guitar for some reason has an annoying buzzing sound no matter what i plug it into so i was surprised when i used an adapter and ran it through this and it didn't have it, just your normal fuzzy sound when you turn the volume on the amp up, the only issue i have with it and it could just be the luck of the draw is to turn off the transmitter you have to take the battery out because the switch doesn't work, but for $15 it can't be beat."
3,"For the price, I am amazed it worked at all","It does work. That's probably the simplest way to put it. It takes a little tinkering to get a good reception. For high quality recording and shooting, obviously this won't do. But for low level, non essential recording, I think it'll do the trick."
3,Pretty Good,I wish the microphone was a bit smaller it looks outdated compared to the newer ones. It picked up the speaker's voice nicely. The reception and everything else was great (as it is all the time with PylePro). I will keep using PylePro until something goes wrong.
4,"Good Wireless Mic, For The Price - Recommended","We bought the Pyle-Pro Lavalier Wireless Microphone System for use with thePyle Pwma230. We needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice. For the price, this worked a lot better than I expected but it did take some adjustment to the ""Trim Screw"" on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed. We also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasn't hanging in front of the speaker (this might not be an issue for you, depending on where you plug yours in).There are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that I'm sure would provide better sound and range, but this one works just fine for our uses.Overall, a good value for the low cost of this unit."
1,Wrong size,"Advertised as compatible with my camera, it wasn't. However, I was able to return this Item with no problem. Thanks!"
1,I've tried THREE of them. Same problem every time.,"After a few days of use, the unit cuts out every time. Whether the problem is with the transmitter or the receiver, I don't know, but I do know it's better to just double the money and get a better piece of equipment."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,Not a quality item. Microphone went out immediately after fist use. Volume is hard to control and it does not work well in the wind either.
1,Bad product,"Unfortunately when insert you the batteries the same not lighted by both this damaged please think well before you buy them and I can not change because I brought it to venezuela my home country and I get very expensive to send it to it replaced me that buy new one here in another brand that if work,"
1,Product sucks,"Dont buy from this department, the mic sucks and sound does not travel good enough, waste of money, not worth it."
1,Failed.,"I bought the Pyle-Pro PDWM96 for use by the officiant at my wedding. The product arrived, the batteries were both dead, so I replaced them with fresh batteries. Plugged into a Pyle amp, the unit never worked, the microphone was bad when I tested it in the unit. I verified its functionality on my computer where it also did not work. I sent it back for a return, and had to use a wired mic instead. Do not purchase this product, especially if you do not have a reliable back-up, or a secondary plan of action."
2,Pyle pro,I ordered two units based on prior reviews. One unit didn't work and second unit was fine. You get what you pay for applies here also. It is not a professional unit but will get you by for a few times. Lots of interferences.
5,Very soft and cuddly,"My son loves this little guy! Well made, not pulling apart at the seams like a lot of his other stuffed animals."
4,An Imperfect Look at Great Performances,"This a very good DVD. There are some low points though. One of them is ""The Worst Pies in London"". If you try to sing this song to yourself you will see why they had it Lip-synched in front of a live audience. The rest of the Dvd for the most part is excellent. The appluase number in the extra is great. Buy this DVD , But with some caution."
2,broadways lost treasures 1,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO FOR BROADWAYS LOST TREASURES 1. THE PICTURE IS VERY FUZZY, AND THE COLOR IS WASHED OUT. THE DISC'S FOR NUMBERS 11 AND 111 ARE FINE AND OF GOOD QUALITY."
3,"Some of these ""treasures"" should have stayed lost.","I am a Broadway musical ""junkie"" and it saddens me to not give this DVD the five star rating it promised. My disappointment came when I noticed some of the numbers are basically the original cast members lip synching to the original cast recordings. Still there are enough ""live"" performances on this DVD to make it well worth the money. Just be prepared to be a little dissappointed for the reasons stated above."
5,Good Diet With Good Fats,"This book cuts through ALL the fad diets and hones in on the truth about insulin, good and bad fats, and how to prevent heart attack from the high insulin levels of Syndrome X. It's a tasty diet that I've found easy to stick to, that emphasizes non-insulin stimulating monounsaturated fat to replace carbohydrate calories. Those carb calories can cause insulin levels to climb dangerously high. My doctor says I have Syndrome X- so thank you Dr. Reaven for your book that came just in time for me."
2,"Great gameplay, but lousy structure","This is a great game on many levels - but has a terrible structure for all but the most hardcore of time-losing gamers. The big problem with this game is that you can only save at the end of levels - and some are massive. So your only options are to either play through the entire level (some take hours), or quit part of the way through and start over at a later date. If you don't have lots of time to dedicate to this game, then you should steer clear. The sanctuary of lava, for example, requires at least 2 hours to clear properly - and remember NO SAVING! It's too bad that such a wonderful game has such a fatal flaw."
5,JAG THE BEST!,"The seasons just got better and better on JAG... DJE and CB were the best couple w. amazing chemistry!!!! The acting was great from the start, but as the years went by the acting got that much better!!!!!! CB is without a doubt one of the most underrated young actresses today- just go and watch her performance in JAG and currently Army Wives and she will soooo not disappoint!! DJE was (and is ) the hottest military guy on TV!!! Get all of the JAGs and you wont be disappointed!! Just now waiting for Season 5!!!!"
5,Loved it,"My daughter enjoyed reading and learning about spiders.We often find different spiders where we live, and this book helps to identify them.There are many fun facts about spiders."
4,It was fair,"The delivery of the book took a lot longer than most my Amazon purchases, but still arrived. The book was also not in the condition I expected it in however, I was satisfied to have received it."
4,kool movie,"i thought that this movie was very good, because it was like really funny to watch and had a good story. the main character elle woods, didnt change much but thats a good thing. some parts could have been better but otherwise, this movie was really great."
1,"Not the worst movie I have seen, but its close","I am writing this to save people some money. I liked the first movie and found it cute and funny and purchased the DVD for my sisters. This movie is terrible. I think they started shooting it before they had a script. My wife and I saw it because we figured that Reese Witherspoon would not damage her credibility with an awful product. We had typically low expectations for a sequel going into it, but even those reduced hopes were let down. ... Save your money."
1,Great candidate for the Razzies! Wost movie EVER!,"Indeed the worst movie ever made, so stupid, so bad, nonsense. Horrible screenplay. Do you now Reese: GET A LIFE!"
1,Does not work,"I put the DVD in my DVD player and it simply does not work. I tried several times, I even tried both sides, and it doesn't work."
4,Laugh a little,"Even if you missed Legally Blonde, this comedic outing is just for fun and can stand alone. Elle Woods takes on the Washington insiders and keeps coming out on top through a combination of sheer luck, connections, and by blondely working out the problems based on her earlier sorority experience.Somewhat dippy, but fun anyway. I thought the grand speech didn't really have what it took to bring about the happy ending, but hey, you have to suspend your brain a bit with this story anyway.Enjoy it for what it is and don't expect great literature, just a fun little film.The DVD included some interesting interviews with the actors and director."
1,REESE WHAT HAPPEND?,"I loved the first movie, it was so good and funny. But this one...it just seemed like the directors said screw it for this movie. The main polt of this movie is about Elle's gay dog and his rights. Okay, I am all for gay rights but...who the heck gives a care if a dog is gay or straight?! Elle seemed like barbie but honestly, Barbie's movies are even better than this. At least they have a polt! And for Reese...I think she really didn't want to act like an idiot for another movie. Though she is a very good actress don't let this movie change your oponion about her! Don't even waste your four bucks renting it."
2,Even Bob Newhart Couldn't Save This Sequel,"I lovedLegally Blonde, but the sequel was so bad as to approach parody of the first movie. The only bright spot was Bob Newhart in a minor role, but even his performance didn't make this movie worth two hours of my life."
1,FAKE BLONDE,"Everything that worked in Legally Blonde is noticeably absent in LEGALLY BLONDE 2: RED, WHITE AND BLUE (MGM/UA). A game Reese Witherspoon does her best with vapid material and collects her $15 mil. But you almost two hours of your life (not counting dubious extras on the disc)."
2,Insipid,"I can't exactly say this was a disappointment, because advance word on this movie was VERY bad. However, it really is a shame to see Reese Witherspoon - who gives a game performance - have to wade through bilge like this. Elaborating on the script's many ludicrous lapses eaps in logic is ultimately pointless; the plot is an afterthought. Many, though not all, of the performers are undone by the poor material. Jennifer Coolidge has maybe one good line (unfortunately, it's not about soup). Luke Wilson is even stiffer than usual. Alanna Ubach now looks about 10 years too old for her part. Bob Newhart is a train wreck. And someone should tell Regina King she walks like a football player. As one of the executive producers, Reese Witherspoon has no one but herself to blame for this mess, but it's her charm and her still-sharp instincts as an actress that keep this movie from being a complete waste of time."
2,"""Red White and Blonde.""","Reese Witherspoon is pack as Elle Woods, with Emmit and of course her little dog too. This movie is not very good and is no where near as good as the first. Elle is there to stop animal testing and reunite her dog with his mother. Elle goes to Washington and is pretty in pink. Its not a good idea, they could have done something MUCH better. I love Reese Witherspoon and was looking forward to this movie coming out but when I saw it I was VERY dissapointed."
1,Save Your Money,"My wife and I have gone to the theater about once a month for the past three years. Let's just say this is the first time we have left about 1 hour into the film and asked for a refund. The manager was kind enough to give us free passes for the next movie we attend. At first I thought it was me, but I looked over at my wife and she was yawning and said she was bored. After a few more minutes of torture while waiting to laugh at least once, we decided to get up and leave. Your money will be far better spent on popcorn and soda or anything else other than the ticket price for this movie. I only give it one star as there is no option for zero stars."
2,well?...,"i love the first legally blonde movie, that's why i'm so eager to this second one. but, i'm sorry to say...this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the whole story is about her stupid little dog. it has no point whatsoever. DON't buy it!! it's not worth ur money."
1,disappointed,unfortunately I have been unable to watch this DVD.iT IS NOT PLAYABLE ON MY EQUIPMENT.iT IS THE FIRST TIME i HAVE BOUGHT A dvd OVER THE INTERNET AND MAYBE i DIDN'T ORDER PROPERLY.dON'T THINK i WILL TRY AGAIN----EXPENSIVE MISTAKE.
2,THERE OUGHTA BE A LAW...,"...against bad sequels, and this one is bad, despite the comedic deftness of Reese Witherspoon. Not even she can save a screenplay that is this bad. It lacks the snappy dialogue and clever madcap situations that elevated the prequel into the ranks of successful screwball comedies. This sequel simply tanks, in spite of Ms. Witherspoon's ever present, personal winsomeness. Despite her, this film falls flatter than a pancake, which is a shame, since the original Legally Blonde movie had been so charmingly funny.Unfortunately, this film is quite disappointing and simply not in the same league, despite the casting of the original star and some of the original supporting cast. Not even the addition of Sally Fields and Robert Newhart elevates this drivel to a film worth watching. Moreover, if you are not a fan of Reese Witherspoon, you should deduct one star from my rating."
2,For the Artist,This marker should NOT be used for drawing. They are not archival safe which means as time passes drawings will warp and become distorted. I originally used these for drafting thumbnails and storyboards but not a simple uniball pen does the trick. -Just a heads up.
4,nice product seems to dry up on certain works,I like this marker it was thin enough but i had some troubles with ink running out fast. maybe because of the art work i was using on.
5,Great for kids,Covers all the major skill areas kids need help with. I also found my child was lacking the basic overall coordination needed to practice these lessons. It definately brought to my attention that coordination is the reason why some players are better than others. Drills were fun and they work! Could have been longer.
1,MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER NEEDED!,"I THOUGHT THAT THIS BACK YARD HOME MADE VIDEO NEED A REAL PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER TO TEACH AND ENCOURAGE A YOUNG A STUDENT TO HAVE A REAL MOTOVATION TO LOOK UP TO AND FOR MYSELF THE TRUST AS A PARENT, THAT MY CHILDREN WERE BEING TAUGHT BY SOMEONE WHO HAS THE REAL MAJOR LEAGUE EXPERIANCE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Recovery Bible Review,"As a hospital chaplain working largely with Dual Diagnosis patients I find the Recovery very helpful. Very important is that the book gives Bible references for each of the 12 steps in the ""12 Step Program"". Then, there are many very helpful articles throughout the book helping the patients apply Scriptural principles to their problems."
2,Not very good,"I was hoping to hear more about the experience of the Marine. But this was mostly letters he wrote to his future wife. It was very boring. The only positive of the book were the great pictures. If you are looking for a book about WWII experiences, don't buy this one."
4,living history,"This book by Huser provides an insightful glimpse of one of the most famous riverine explorations in American history. By defly flipping between historic journal interpretations and personal riverine reflections, Huser provides an incredibly rewarding and fun read, informed from his long experience with, and intimate knowledge of, America's wild waterways. For these reasons, I was very grateful that Huser accepted an invitation from my publisher (Green Frigate Books) to write one of the front-end blurbs for the recently published Deep Immersion: The Experience of Water."
1,"Used them 2 days, already one ear is out","This is my second style of Coby headphones that I have used. Each style has been awful and broken within the first few days - and I run a computer lab so I buy them in multiples, and we're talking ALL but one or two of them broke within the first few uses. This headphone was no different. I will never buy Coby again."
2,Staffordshire Bull Terriers,"I was very disappointed with this book. So much could have and should have been included, but 3/4 of the publication is taken up by general medical non-information. The breed is a favorite of mine and Anna Katherine Nicholas is a wonderful author, but this book deserves it's very low rating. It's too bad."
2,Does not work for guinea pig cages.,"The product description states that this can be used for small animals. What it doesn't say is that you cannot use this item on a cage with a bottom and plastic sides. When you attach the crock to a guinea pig cage, they can't reach it to use it. I think they should specify that it can only be used for animals that can use full cages (like rabbits) but a cage with a wire bottom cannot be used for guinea pigs because it would damage their feet. Also, when you return something to Pet Supplies 4 Less, they charge you 15% to take it back even if it is unused and still in the wrapper."
2,Still NEVER Received Item,I ordered this video over a month ago and still never received it from sdboutlaw so be careful when buying from him because he never sent my video and I've message him 3 times now and got no response.
2,Disappointing,"My husband and I were disappointed in this game. We waited for two months while we built a new computer to play this game (for optimal game play and graphics). Although the graphics were outstanding, the game was simple. Unlike Riven and Myst, the game tells you when a clue is needed by changing the arrow to a hand or gears. So simple, our seven year old can play it. We finished this game in just 2 hours. What a waste."
1,Found no way to make run on Win 7,"Tried so many glide and 3dfx ""wrappers"". Can't get it to run on Windows 7. Sigh, unless I get an old XP machine or older I guess I can't run this."
3,"Flimsy, but attaches well to the board","The overall frame is very flimsy and I constantly feared breaking it on accident. However, it attaches very securely to the board. The eraser is also cheap and somewhat flimsy, almost threadbare. The markers worked excellent. Considering that the price was nice just to be getting the markers, I can't complain too much. It's good enough."
2,"Great Production, Poor DVD","This is a wonderful classic. I have purchased each season as it has become available on DVD. I am usually very happy with A&E's DVD's, but I am not sure what went wrong with, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Season Four had some very long periods where the picture was so blurred that it bothered my eyes to watch it. Overall, I am quite disappointed with the results on DVD. I know I will continue to purchase each season, because I really enjoyed the series when it was on television, but I wish the quality was better."
2,exesive price,"I bought exactly the same converse snekers, same color same sizesame everything at Marshals store for $19.99 no shiping...Big diference on $56.00 that I paid to you???????How I supose to call this...........Exelente business.......( for you of course)............Good deal (for you) of course..........You thing that I will back to buy more with you?????????"
5,Excellent Introduction to Phonetics,"This book provides an easy to follow yet scholarly and solid approach in acoustic Phonetics. In contrast with other Phonetics books, this book does not assume that the reader is Linguistics students; it will probably appeal to you if you are one though. Having received no prior formal education in the fields of Phonetics or Phonology, it helped me build a good (initial) understanding of notions around the topic and feel comfortable when approaching more phonologically orientated texts. A final point I liked was the fact that paradigms are coming from a variety of world's languages.I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore Phonetics and/or is in need of a good up-to-date reference and overview of the area."
3,Not as pictured,"The photo on Amazon shows the cable ends with protective coverings over those easily broken plastic tabs. However, the cable that was shipped to me does not have the protective coverings."
3,Died over time.,"This cable worked great for the first year, after that the cable connector pulled out of the cable. dissapointed, but worked well for that first year."
1,brandmeier ..thumbs down,"I don't like John B. He's sarcastic, repeats material, just has a negative attitude, ridicules people, pushes callers to make fools of themselves. Maybe this makes John feel superior?"
4,short sharpe,"Having been a longtime Sharpe and Bernard Cornwell reader, I was unsure about the short story format. If you are a Sharpe fan, add this to your collection. You will not be dissapointed."
4,Training Sessions,Quite enjoyed this DVD. Gives plenty of food for thought and ideas for different sessions in your own context. Enjoyable
3,Probably break easily,"As the previous reviewer said, these don't dangle freely, that is, they are actually attached to the back and don't move. This probably means that they will break easily. I bought these on sale (60% off), so they're probably worth about that much, as they are pretty, like the picture, and have a nice feel to them. I would still wear them, but I would be a lot more cautious than normal. For $25, you can buy nicer stuff at the store."
5,Beautiful!,These earrings are beautiful! I am not sure what I will do with them yet. Keep them or give them away!
2,C. Crane SoftSpeaker Pillow Speaker,"The wire that they use on this pillow speaker is way to small, the wire break where it enters the speaker. I guess they would rather sell you 5 cheap ones verses one good onebut I have looked around at other brands and cant find a good one."
2,C. Crane pillow speaker,I purchased one in Dec 2010 and have used it every night. If it works it works well. The problem is the wire. It is not sturdy enough. I have duct taped a straw around it in order for it not to bend. If the wire bends the sound is gone. I will never buy another one. I am replacing it.
4,Crane PS2 SofSpeaker Pillow,"I have been thru (broke) several different kinds of under pillow speakers. This is the best of the lot. No distortion found and volume good. Previous units failed due to wiring separation. Should this happen here I'll report it. So far, I'm very happy. Reserving five stars for next year at this time."
3,"OK, but not great","I Bought this to replace a cheap speaker pillow that I've had for years which recently died. Aside from a shipping mishap, which Amazon took care of promptly, this replacement has been a bit of a disappointment.My main problem is that it's not very loud. I have to turn the the MP3 player twice as loud as the one it replaced in order to make voices audible. After a few nights, I ditched the plush cover and just placed the thin speaker under my pillow which helped a bit with the volume issue. This also made it feel like less of a lump under the pillow as well.On a far less important note, the sound quality is fairly poor, but we're talking about sound coming through a pillow, so I'm not really expecting much.On the plus side, it is very small (about the size of an Oreo cookie)and has a nice long cord."
1,To Julia and all of you out there,"This compilation is weak...if you are looking for the true hard,universal, underground house music that is suggested by the title of this album, you are mistaken.This album is not only monotonous, but weak."
3,average,"this clock is about as average as it gets, no frills, it ticks about as loud as an average clock but i also had some trouble getting it to work properly for about a week, the wiring must be poorly done because it would either stop working altogether or just keep really bad time. fiance made me take out the battery though after a couple weeks because the ticking was driving him crazy. not sure how the day light saving function works."
5,Beautiful picture,"I received this picture within a few days of ordering it. Was sent in a tube, therefore came undamaged. Beautiful quality and I was satisfied."
5,Great book.,Got for daughter's baby shower since she wanted Pooh nursery. She loved it. Now her son who is 2 does too.
4,Paella de caja.. surprisingly good,"I think there's an echo in here: this is a good product, but it's far better when more seafood is added to it. It goes without saying that it's not as good as making a paella from scratch, but it takes all of 4 minutes of actual work plus 20 minutes of wandering off while it cooks. Buy some extra shellfish to go with it and you have a relatively cheap and extremely easy dinner with leftovers that are just as good as dinner was. I used a can of calamari in addition; it was good but cooked shrimp or mussels would be even better."
2,Blues? Tab?,"All and all, a pretty nice product. However, I have a few complaints. First, I was hoping that this would help me really extent my blues repertoire. Although there are some blues songs on this DVD, a lot of the pieces just aren't bluesy enough for my taste. Second, THE ONLY WAY TO ACCESS THE MUSIC AND TAB IS WITH A DVD ROM PLAYER ON YOUR COMPUTER. THERE IS NO BOOK. I don't have a DVD player on my computer, so it is hard to learn the songs without starting and stopping the song on the DVD player."
5,I LOVE how truly washable these are,"I just found where my 2 year old (who was playing with her big sister's markers) wrote on our wooden flooring last night. I got a damp rag and it wiped up without any problem at all. I wish everything my two little hooligans play with was this easy to clean up. Thank you, Crayola!"
2,Stanley 7 hole punch,"While the puncher is sturdy, it could not be adjusted to punch the center hole. The lever mechanism blocks the center so that papers were always off-center."
1,Not compatible with Day-Timer desk format looseleaf planner,"While well-designed in general, this product is incapable of punching holes that are compatible with the Day-Timer ""desk"" format looseleaf planner system."
5,Yummy!,"I love this lotion. It smells wonderful--a light, rose scent without being overpowering. It glides on smoothly and is immediately absorbed, not greasy at all. The tube is a generous size but great for travel--just remember to put it in your suitcase and not your carryon, or it will be tossed as you go through security. If you like roses, get this lotion. It's yummy!"
4,"Great game, although lacking in AI","This game is really fun, from building the zoo to unlocking new animals and expanding. The only problem is the AI. Maintenance workers will form a troop and all change the same trash can or fix the same fence. Zookeepers will tend to the same animals unless they are assigned or 'locked' in a cage. Sometimes a customer will be walking right through the food court all upset because they're hungry or tired, but won't sit down or buy a drink. Haha But regardless of all of this, the game is definitely worth playing. Hours of entertainment for me anyway."
4,BETTER THEN EXPECTED,I REALLY ENJOY TYCOON GAMES WHERE I HAVE HANDS ON IN EVERY BUILDING ASPECT OF THE GAME. ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THERE IS LIMITED SPACE. AFTER YOU USE IT UP THATS IT!
4,"Great game, new content","I re-bought this game after having owned it when I was younger. It is still lots of fun and I enjoy playing through the scenarios. Even though I already had a copy of each expansion (now lost) I found that in this complete collection there were a lot more items available, newer animals and even new scenarios that I never before had when I had the other 3 disks. If you own the game but not the complete collection I highly recommend this. And if you've never played it before, well what are you waiting for?"
5,LOST MY FIRST ONE AND GOT A NEW ONE.,I LOST THE ONE I HAD ALREADY SO WHEN I SAW THIS GAME ON HERE I ORDERED IT. THIS GAME IS SOO MUCH FUN.
5,addictive,"Before getting this, I couldn't understand how people could sit in front of a computer playing a game for hours on end. Now I see. What an addictive game. Played with this all weekend long building the zoo, adding employees and exhibits, tinkering with prices for the restaurant and food stands. Today I'm going to try some of the 'cheats.' I'm going to have to get a timer to control my game time. It's easy to get caught up in this."
5,Animal lover's Heaven,"This game is a blast and the only problem is that you can not stop playing. All the animals are totally adorable and if you keep their exhibits to their likes that will pay you back with offspring. I initially thought of this fame as for children, but its for anyone, especially for the animal lovers. Definitely worth a buy!"
3,nostalgia beware,I loved this game as a kid and I lamented the day i lost my old copy so when I found it here for 10 bucks I was overjoyed. sadly that's all its really worth. The game gets boring really quickly as there are few major challenges to overcome and there is not a lot you can tweak. even the animals exhibits offer little which is sad because I remember this being a great game.
3,none worth making,"not enough swans, only zaharova worth watching, russian ballet head and shoulders above this performance.kirov and bolshoi rule. music not at all exciting and opening appearance of the swans only 16 plus 3 plus 4 an economy version if ever i saw one, only iceland ballet as bad"
3,Welding Basics,"This is a nice overview of the various welding methods. It provides the basic info you need in the beginning. From this point, you can get books with more detail on the specific method you need."
3,Great entertainer but,Tremendous entertainer but sound quality is lacking. He's hard to hear a times and prefer other recordings that I have of his.
3,Firmness,The product itself is very good but just a little too firm to meet my needs. I will continue to use it as I can
3,Worth It,These pens worked well for what i needed.Right better when more vertical.Clean fine writing lines that. Awesome. i
4,Literary landmarks,"This book of Frank Morley was the first one that I bought, when I started collecting books about Literary landmarks in Great Britain. I'm much interested to read, where great authors and poeets found there inspiration. Frank Morley guided me through England and with him I ""met"" a lot of minor authors and poeets (William Cowper, Thomas Gray)who also deserve a place in English Literature."
1,Terrible Book,Would never recommend this book. It has been awhile since I owned a schnauzer but this book is a schnoozer.Miniature Schnauzers (KW Dog)Miniature Schnauzers (KW Dog)
4,Friends forever,"This book was given to me as a gift from a dear friend. For those of you with great girlfriends this will make you laugh, make you cry and make realize what a great friend you have. The pages are fun filled sayings with lots of color, and a great read the first time and any time you need a pick me up. Buy it for yourself or for that special friend."
2,Finding it hard to finish this one,"I'm 47% into this book and find I'm starting to skim through it. The female lead just isn't likable and I can't imagine what the lead male sees in her. She's done nothing but be a complete bitch. I hope the second half gets better and if it does, I'll come back and revise this review, but at this point, I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Learned about the sport(only good part)...but this guy is an idiot!,"Yes I understand how addiction can take hold of someones life and how difficult it can be to overcome, but at the same time, this guy goes from one addiction that partially ruined his life and jumped right to the next which he's allowing/allowed to ruin his marriage. He complains about how he's allowing it to happen and how he doesn't want to lose his family, yet he keeps travelling all over the world competing in events. Seems VERY selfish!!!"
5,Simply the best,"Being a native of Phoenix I have been exposed to many book on this subject and this is by far the best. Mr. Glover has truly ""done his homework."" Most dutchman books simply offer a collection of facts with very little analysis. Mr. Glover offers in depth study with a personal feel. His analyses are well thought out and even offer some new information. This should be the cornerstone in the library of any true dutch hunter. It is also sure to get the blood flowing of even the most skeptical person."
4,"Better than ""Hooking Up""","Same style as the new show ""Hooking Up"" but better. See if you can determine the ending! I bet you can't! Fun Movie!"
4,Good Buy,i got this for my brother in law as a father's day present and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was well built and light. it is well designed with a pouch to carry your beach stuff and very comfortable to relax in.
1,Doesn't work,"This product just doesn't work, unless your breasts are the EXACT size of the ""bras"". Even cutting down the sides or the excess edges of the product, once you lay it over your breast, you have to IMMEDIATELY try and flatten all the ""material"" over your breast, so that it lays perfectly flat. It is impossible to accomplish this, so the end result is that you end up with creases in the ""fabric"" of the bra, so that once you then put a shirt on over it (assuming the shirt is of a thin or clingy fabric) you can then see all the folds/creases in the bra through the fabric. What a waste of money!"
3,A Good offering but a few too many fillers,"The Super Furries, I suppose, must be up there with the great Welsh exports of Anthony Hopkins and Tom Jones. Northern Lites is the stand out track on this album along with Do or Die and The Door. Yet you get the feeling some tracks wre tossed in casually as the boys' imagination began to run out: The Teacher and Nightvision being culpable suspects. It's close but no cigar."
3,"GREAT book, TERRIBLE previous owner",The book is 5* for content but 2* for condition. The previous owner mutilated it with highlighter. There were whole pages highlighted for parts of the book and some pages had completely random unimportant facts highlighted. It did not take away from the content but I found myself consistently agitated while reading it (based off of content but MOSTLY the terrible condition).I should not have paid the price I did for such a terribly kept book.
1,do not waste ur money,The movie is a very low grade quality production--not even worth viewing. The sender was great but the product really sucks!!
1,Flap not replaceable & doesn't last,"The frame is very solid, but that's about it. The latch on the security plate broke off day 1. The flap lasted several months before it started to come apart at the top ""hinge"". I slowed this down by duct taping it, but eventually the flap completely detached. The lame thing is the flap is not replaceable - you have to buy the whole pet door. So now I'm stuck with a big hole in my door. Either I can buy this again and have it rip again in a few months, try in vain to find another brand pet door that fits the same hole in my door or buy a whole new door and a new pet door."
1,Flap broke weeks after,"The flap tore right off the door within weeks of installing it. Very disappointed, save your money for something better!!"
3,"Fun, But Poorly Organized Zombie Film Book","Reading the summary of this volume, you might reasonably expect a good bio of this neglected subgere of horror filmmaking...but you would be wrong. The first 10 percent of the book does indeed overview the origins of Cannibal and Zombie films, but the bulk of the volume is a hodgepodge of reviews and (mostly short and not very illuminating) interviews with stars and directors. The reviews themselves range from near brilliant (mostly Jay Slater's stuff) to borderline retarded (the Cannibal movie review by an Italian actor is damn near unreadable). Bonus points for some great--and obviously rare--poster artwork. Not bad, and not a bad price. Just keep your expectations moderate."
5,Excellent Product for an Awesome Price,"I've recently bought this phone and it works great and for under $50 I think it's the most awesome deal you can find. So it you're considering it, then go right ahead. The only reason not to by this phone is....you need more than 2 handsets!"
2,Callers Can't Hear Me,"I needed to return my phone. The parties I called could not hear me loud enough. I've asked for a replacement. Perhaps I had a defective unit or it's just a poor design. We'll see how it goes when I get the replacement and try it out. If it's still bad, back it goes for a refund."
5,The Name Says It,"And all that nine inch nails could have been is captured on this cd. songs like terrible lie, sin, head like a hole and even suck are more complete and amazing. March of the pigs also gets a good treatment at the end, and even the day the whole world went away has an additional part that makes the song incredible.Cd for fans or people who want to discover nine inch nails. I, myself became a hardcore nine inch nails fan, after seeing the live dvd, then going off to buy this album the next day. Songs life Starf*uckers, Inc get you really hooked up on it, and what better to finish that with Hurt. This cd is like a best of."
4,"New NIN - Great, but just a little sloppy?","So OK, granted Trent and the band prove that they can perform with the best of them. They put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into each and every song, but, did someone forget to do a decent job at mixing the CD? I love NIN and always have, but the chopped off beginning and endings drive me nuts. It's like they downloaded these songs using a file sharing proggy. (All you former Napster users know exactly what I mean...) Whatever happened to fade in, fade out? That aside, if you are a true NIN fan, this CD is a must have. They are definitely one of the best live bands out there. Their music has heart, soul and that extra something that gets the blood pumping."
3,Interesting but pointless,"I'm about ten years removed from high school. However, this film helped me to vividly bring back the dysfunctional aspects of high school life: the shallow social cliques, the weird walks through the hallway, indifferent faculty, etc. I also grew up in Oregon with its rapidly changing weather and moods, about 50 miles North of where a similar school rampage took place at Springfield High School.The individual student's portrayal seemed very honest even if there was a contrived overabundance of problems such as drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, and eating disorders.In Elephant, the random fragments of individual lives had no meaning as a whole. The final scene spoke for the entire film, that is, abrupt, and totally random with no purpose. I viewed Elephant hoping to gain insight into why teenage boys would perform such horrible acts. I learned nothing new.In sum, Elephant is interesting but pointless."
2,It should have had a script,"Expecting the teenage actors to come up with interesting relevant dialog on their own without a script was a huge mistake in this film. That supposedly made it more realistic but, no - they knew they were being filmed. The conversations were fake, contrived and uninteresting. It made the kids thoughts seem so trivial and put-on and made the viewers generally bored. ""Like she's all like this and so I'm like like I'm that..."" Please! What this movie needed was a writer. There was no depth to any of the characters so we didn't care about them. And, as others have said, why did we have to follow and follow and follow these kids through endless halls? This movie could have cut out all the boring parts and been about 8 minutes long."
4,disturbing...,"Overall this film is unique. I won't repeat what others have said because I do agree with them(those who praised the film). To E.E. McCain, I really don't care if you received 1300 on your SAT. That doesn't prove anything. I don't follow this film because its considered 'trendy', but because it's true; the majority of high school students ignore their surroundings."
5,Amazing,"Although this movie may seem slow and boring, it really isn't. It requires concentration to really get the point of the movie, and to make the connections. For example, you can hear overlapping conversations numerous times, depending on who the camera is following.Many things in this movie are shocking, but thought provoking. It ends suddenly, and unexpectedly. It really makes you think about what you just saw.I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.Even if you're not going to buy it, you should at least rent it. I'm not going to say you'll love it, because it's definitely one of those movies where it's likeable to specific kinds of people. Everyone has told me good things about it, so when I went to watch it I got nervous because I had such high expectations and I didn't want to be disappointed. Thankfully, my friends were all right.Love this movie."
3,a movie not for everyone,"ok, i originally bought this movie because my friends had watched it on HBO. they told me there was a ""taxi driver"" type ending. and being a huge taxi driver fan i figured it would be a good buy. after watching it i would have to say that it was a pretty good movie. but there were alot of things i had to look past. the acting i would have to say at best was below average....alot of studdering and line goofs. if you can look past the low budgetness of the film (and i mean that in the nicest way)its a good conceptThe part i liked most about the film was the fact that it didnt have alot of hollywood action explosion and gunfire and people flying through window and all that sort of nonsense. it was probably the rawest form of action you could see. gunshots sound like guns....not cannons. and i think that that counts when your trying to sell this movie as an actual event such as it was."
1,Elephant,"This is the worst movie ever made and a true disappointment from Gus Van Sant. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE AND DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE. Do not watch this movie if it is free and you have nothing else to do. Cleaning your toilet on a Saturday night would be more enjoyable. I assume Gus Van Sant thought he was being artistic with his long camera views of kids walking down the halls but instead it was irritating beyond words. There was no character development, a lack of interesting dialogue and by the time you realize two kids were being portrayed as the Columbine killers, you almost wish for the shooting to begin to end the misery of watching this horrible film. And then to add insult to injury, the killing scenes were unemotional and poorly captured. Obviously the the killers were meant to be cold and disengaged, but shouldn't the viewers and victims be feeling something? I cannot figure out why Gus Van Sant wanted his audience to die along side of his movie."
1,Beyond bad,"I am quite shocked by the favorable reviews I'm seeing for what is definately the worst movie Van Sant ever made, and just an all-around bad movie in general. There is no character development - I didn't care at all that these kids were going to be massacred. In fact, I kept looking at my watch waiting for the shooting to begin so the movie would be over. Everyone already knows the plot, but even without the mystery you would think there would be cool cinematography, good acting, interesting dialog...something. The movie has none of these things - don't waste your time. If you want shaky camera shots of teenagers walking around all day, rent Kids again."
3,Obviously not what many thought it would be...,"A fictional account with obvious real-life aspects to it... beautifully filmed and acted, considering there were no real 'actors' in the film. It was obvious that the intent was to simply present the story in a chronologically backwards style and allow you to draw your own conclusions- and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the reason good films don't depict real life in real-life time is because it's simply boring to do so. It screams of having a great, short premise, but having to film SOMETHING to make it a full-length feature. The point of 'this is everyday life' is not lost on most of the people watching it- but it makes for slow, dull cinema. That's the case here for a good portion of the movie."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHH,"WARNING STAY AWAY, HORRIBLE MOVIE. If you like watching people walking around and doing nothing for over an hour, then this movie is for you. This was honestly the worse movie that I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of movies."
1,tour de force? nope,"i have read many reviews of this movie which say how great it is, blah blah. well what a disappointment. it is an example of a movie on a sensitive subject matter that mainstream media figures can't bash, simply because it would somehow by association be construed as them marginalizing the subject matter. this movie blows."
1,Movie Fanatic,"This was a very boring movie. If the movie is supposed to be a high school shooting, they should have focused on that. The French New-wave filming was extremely boring. Watching a boy walk around a school for ten minutes is not interesting at all. I was very unhappy with this movie. Being a film student, I've come to terms that first time film students produce better films than this."
2,A Lazy Portrayal of Columbine,"I was pretty disappointed with this movie. Had higher expectations from Gus van Sant. The driving idea behind this movie hits home about 10 minutes into the film and it plateaus from there. Lots of scenes with high school teens walking around and talking about shallow stuff that teens do. We get it, Gus, you're offering a microscopic look into the simplicity of teen life, as they unknowingly await tragedy that is just around the corner. A lot of people will tell you that if you don't like this film, you were just looking for action, and violence, and that you aren't cerebral enough to appreciate a good, slow-moving, film. Let me tell you, this is not the case. Just because it's slow, doesn't make it good. If you want to see a good Columbine film, watch Zero Day- it's gripping, disturbing, and the acting was so good, some people thought they were actually showing real footage of Columbine."
2,Flat,"Gus Van Sant's exercise in documentary-style filmmaking takes on a difficult subject (high school shootings) but goes no further than detachment and cliche. There are the bullied kids. The ""in"" girls (they vomit in unison after eating in the cafeteria). The shy girl who works in the library. Etc. Van Sant doesn't seem to care enough to attach any depth to his characters, and he allots them only such prefuntory moments on screen so that we know who they are when they get gunned down. A film like this makes a viewer reconsider the director's entire career. Was there anything there at all, to begin with? Or were we just giving him the benefit of the doubt? What is his exulted reputation based on? Drugstore Cowboy? This film, and his other recent work, for certain, is vacant, and feels like an exercise rather than a fully-realized piece of art. His choice of subject matter seems less brave than mere exploitation, and for that reason is maddening."
2,"Wobbles, Creeks, Unstable",Buy a better set then these. Okay if you weight about 100lbs. I weigh 220 and way to unstable. Dropping these turds at a donation center.
2,waste of $,These are flimsy plastic push up bars that you could replicate with a heavier duty pvc from your local home store for$4 and not feel like you were going to break them mid push-up
2,It was a gift for an 8 year old boy just getting into hockey,"The gift The Mighty Ducks / D2: The Mighty Ducks / D3: The Mighty Ducks (Three-Pack) (1994) was what he (birthday boy)wanted. The first movie is ok, the rest to me are a waste, but he liked it."
5,mighty ducks,"This was a fun, silly video that my grandson and his dad thoroughly enjoyed. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
2,No thanks!,"I started this book, but never really got into in. Maybe I didn't have the time or wasn't in the right mood, but I actually didn't even finish it. It was slow and if a book doesn't get my attention right away, I have trouble with it. I could tell right away that I didn't like Mac. Don't like women who act like men. Gavin might have been okay with someone else. Other people have liked this book, but I put it down and didn't want to pick it up again."
5,A new world of fishing is revealed,Understanding and catching the wylie Kokanee is laid out with great detail. The secrets disclosed make me anxious to get the equipment and start fishing. You can't read this book and not get excited to give his techniques a whirl. That is especially true of someone (like me) that lives a short drive from the heart of great Kokanee habitat.
3,Old but good,"This older book may be helpful in identifying Boletes, but the understanding of the phylogeny of the Boletineae is simply wrong. Use Singer if you wish to have a better understanding of the relationships between genera in the Boletineae."
2,A real disappointment -- go with the A&E Biography instead,"This is a listless, plodding, dispassionately-narrated biography of the man who is very likely the greatest all-around entertainer ever. The on-camera commentary is provided not by people who knew Sammy personally, but by a couple of historians and a tap dancer who speak about his artistic achievements and significance from a dry, rather remote perspective. The A&E biography has all the information this one does, and more, and packages it in a much more compelling and comprehensive documentary. This was a great disappointment."
5,Great Pen!,Rolls over the ball point competition. Smooth to use. Flows well. No complains (other than my office doesn't carry these & I have to order my own... ha ha).
4,Good if your Computer is best of the best of the best,"If you got your computer last year or before, there will probally be graphical problems. Still, it is a great family game."
5,Great book for young readers!!!,Reading this book was very fun and entertaining. I hope every parent and child enjoys as much as we did.Good.
2,disappointed,I bought this book because my baby always gets the hiccups and I thought it would be a cute book to read to him. It was not that funny and honestly I would have sent it back but it cost half the price of the book to return. I knew from the reviews the words were made up to rhyme and because of that my husband said he would never read this to our son when he gets older.
3,Good cute book,"It was A good, cute book, my 7 year old thought it was a funny word book. He likes rhyming books."
4,Cute book,My kids thought it was cute. A little difficult to read some of the silly words but fun. Cute book.
4,It was cute,Cute story. I really enjoyed the rhyming and rhythm even if they are not real words. The story is not too long so a great read before bed on those long days when you still want to keep up the routine. Got it free with the Amazon prime so even better deal.
3,Super fun hi cup!,We really enjoyed the sillyness of this story. It had great illustrations. We thought the had lots of personality. Will look for more stories like this one.
4,My 4yr old son loves it,My 4yr old son loves it. He loves the funny words and funny things that happen when there is a hiccup. he must do all the hiccuping too. my only negative is we wish it was longer. I need to read this book 3times in a row.
4,Board book,"I couldn't find the hardback version of the book and settled on this one for the birthday gift i was shopping for. I was sad to see the cast of characters was missing, which totally makes the book. Still, since it was for a 1 year old the choice was excellent."
3,Awful in opposite ways,"HOUSEGUEST is an awful movie but its star, comic-actor Sinbad, is awful funny! Throughout HOUSEGUEST, Sinbad's non-stop verbal and physical humor keeps you laughing. Good thing, too, because otherwise the film offers little that is amusing or even interesting. See HOUSEGUEST just for the monsoon comedy of Sinbad and hope the comedian eventually gets to appear in a quality picture."
4,An excellent introduction to a premier British folk band.,"Spanning the Years is an excellent introduction to one of the premier British folk bands. While not of the same caliber as the Sandy Denny-Richard Thompson Fairport Convention, the band stuck more closely to their roots than FC. The novice listener will find all of Steeleye Span's best-known (if not their best) tunes on this compilation. The reason why I gave this only 4 stars is the album does not hold together as well as one might like. This is a problem I have with most ""Greatest Hits"" collections. These best of anthologies sound like somebody threw an artist's material together at random, sprinkling the chartbusters in with some decent cuts from the albums. If you're not that familiar with their work, buy this cd and if you like it search out the other albums. Some recommendations: ""Hark! The Village Wait,"" ""Commoner's Crown,"" and ""Now We are Six."""
4,Beautifully written,"As soon as I picked up this book, I was transported into India and the lives of these two women. The descriptions and emotions brought out in this book are amazing. Since I just finished reading ""The Help,"" I couldn't help but see the parallels here with how the servant and ruling classes relate. The story beautifully illustrates how looks can be deceiving and that money isn't everything although we often think it is."
4,A story of friendship,"The book is a very, very sad story of the sometimes tender, sometimes painful friendship between two women. It was well written and easy to read though the book did not ""call"" me. The caste system is alive and well in India. I had trouble believing is was set in current times. I am looking forward to reading other books by this talented author. I have heard her other works are even better. Every member of our book club enjoyed it."
4,ok,"The plot of this story is good, but it takes along time for it to develope I would have liked it to move along"
2,The Predictable Space Between Us,"This book came highly recommended, and unfortunately it disappointed me. The plot was highly predictable, after the first 35 pages or so. In the end it turned out to be more of a soap opera than an intelligent insight into the characters that I was looking forward to. The book does not even come close to Rohinton Mistri's depiction of the Parsi community in Bombay and is more melodramatic than thought provoking."
1,"There is no hope, there are no good people!","The characters are pathetic. The women downtrodden and victimized. People are so consistently mean, devious, and self-absorbed that reading it was painful.There is no redemption, no hope, no moment of peace or forgiveness. I am not sure what the author's intent was.I do not recommend this book and only gave it one star - because you have to give it at least one."
4,Great book club read,I originally read this book because Amazon recommended it as a book I would like. I then recommended it to my book group a few months later. I reread the book with my group. I enjoyed it even more the second time. Bhima's eternal hope that people will act appropriately is both frustrating and endearing. The members of my book club liked the complex characters of Bhima and Sera. When you finish the book be sure to go back and read the first page again.
5,A wonderfully evocative read,"The story of two women of vastly different backgrounds who share many years of close contact as servant and mistress, yet remain widely separated by social convention. The language is evocative and the story compelling. A wonderful, thoughtful read."
4,Imitation of Life,"Set in modern-day India and told through two women, the movel shows how the lives of the rich and the poor are intrinsically connnected yet vastly removed from each other, and captures how the bonds of womamhood are pitted against the divisions of class and culture. Reminded me of the Lana Turner movie Imitation of Life. An interesting book that makes you thik about how fortunate we in America really are."
3,"Beautifully written, good characters, but ultimately too depressing","I started this book this week and enjoyed reading it - the characters were interesting and multi-dimensional and I appreciated the different vantage points provided by the author. However, it was ultimately so dismal and depressing that I couldn't finish it. I skimmed through to the end to see if there was any redemption for any of them, but since there was not, I ended up putting it down. Another criticism - with the exception of Sera's father in law, who was a pretty minor character, all of the men in the book were terrible. Even Freddy, who was at least kind, was ultimately a coward. I liked the writer's style enough that I will check out her other books, assuming that they aren't as bleak and dismal as this one."
1,Lion King,"This like ALL MY PURCHASES FOR AMIGA SOFTWARE has been a disaster, I have not received the right kind of software yet. I've received every other format but Amiga like IBM, Sega and Atari and this has happened 12 out of 12 times, sometimes I get my money back but I'm tired of fighting it. I have paid for my last product from Amazon.com. They continue to let items other than Amiga be listed on the Amiga site so it's worthless too me."
1,Don't waste your money.,This tape is a complete waste of money. It basically explains that kids need to be taught teamwork. It does not teach any basics or explain any rules. I only bought it because the one I wanted was on backorder.
4,Wanderings:,"This book arrived in good shape, it was used to start with. I came in good time, only a couple of days. I bought this for someone else so have not read it myself."
4,metroplex rules baby whoo,liked this story back in the 80's rodimus was better in the comics thAN in the toons arcee reminisces about the time her and hot rod were an item but in the toons she was always around springer. the qyuintessons were cool villians they tripped me out how they always played the decepts for fools this time soundwave leads thwe cons but cool this is also metroplex only appearance in the comics and boy it was huge cool story you dig transformers from the old school please cop thios.
3,great gift,"for a young teen or bridal gift, this is an inexpensive way for jewelry. it's a modern style that appeals to all fashion styles. this is a nice piece of jewelry."
4,clean up,"This is a great product to make clean up very easy. Just coat your hands before you start a messy task such as painting, washing your hands afterwards gets all the ""mess"" off easily. I was not able to find it in the hardware store and glad amazon carries it."
3,"Decent, but there's MUCH better out there...","Okay, I bought this a while ago and just got around to reviewing it. The gun is very light, and all plastic. The only metal is the inner barrel. It is extremely accurate as a result of having a low FPS, but doesn't have any range. The sights are normal M16 sights. I noticed that one is slightly higher than the other so I assumed that it was for long range. The stock breaks off very easily, as well as the rest of the gun. I broke the stock while running with it slung. Then, my friend accidently knocked it off the back of a truck (about 3 feet), and the whole gun shattered. Here's my final verdict, spend the extra $20-$30 to get a good spring, or get a nice AEG. This is great for a starter gun, and okay for small games with friends."
4,We will never know.,"What a mystery. Did Mallory & Irvin summit before Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953? We will probably never know, so its up to the viewer to come to his or her own conclusion. This video has great information and detailed maps of where clues were left behind. Everest has always been a passion of mine and this video is an important part of my collection as far as the history of the mountain goes.The climbers on this expidition are on a mission to find the bodies of Mallory and Irvin and search a mountain were humans don't belong. I dont think Mallory made the top, but what do you think.......?"
2,Dated,"Although the acting by the lead is quite good, and although the film is no doubt of considerable historical importance, it does not hold up that well to the modern eye. Too many of the scenes seem by now stale and too many of the situations overdone or clumsy."
1,Very disappointed...,"I ordered this item as shown in the picture, but that was NOT what I received. I had a Valeo ribbed mat before, and just wanted another. What I received was a cheaply made, small version of a ribbed mat. It did not have the brand name Valeo on it anywhere. Needless to say I would not recommend ordering from the ""Wife and Mother"" site (which originated at Amazon.com) because of the ""bait and switch"" tactic they employed with my order."
2,Not a great toy.,I purchased this item for my grand daughter for Christmas and she has only played with it once. She got a lot of other toys but was not interested in this at all. It is built well but there is not enough to do with it.
2,Not impressed. OK - I was disappointed,"All I can say is that I expected a lot more from Swingline. This stapler is marginal at best, in terms of both its construction, and performance. It continually jams, and this is just for light duty, such as stapling 3-4 pages. I expected more from Swingline. I've used ACCO / Swingline products in the past, with much better results. This stapler does not compare to the Swingline staplers made 15-20 years ago. Go with the metal versions, or try to pick up an older one at a flea market or a garage sale. You'll get better results than with this model. IMO."
4,good stapler,"the bottom part of the stapler is a little light, if the bottom pad was made of metal material, that would be much better"
4,Great,This is a good staple.It is hard work and it made of good materials.I recommend this staple for anyone.
2,NOT FOR P90X2,"The ad was misleading...these med balls are very small, no where near the size that I needed and was hoping for for the P90X2 workout. They may be acceptable for other things, but if you're looking for something for that, it's no good!!!"
1,Not very satisfied,"I do not like this ball because it is filled with sand that sloshes around as you move the ball. It is very annoying. If the sand completely filled the ball, it would be acceptable. I think I would prefer a medicine ball-which is actually what I thought I was getting anyway."
3,not 100% cotton,"If you are looking for 100% cotton socks, these are not.I was looking for 100% cotton socks and the search returned this product as a ""related product"". I wrongly assumed that these were 100% cotton socks. They are not, they are 86% cotton. I think maybe Amazon should include this information in a clearer way.I am alergic to some of the materials generally used in socks, so I generally cannot wear anything that is not 100% cotton (or very similar). As 86% is still high I tried them and so far I have not experienced problems."
4,Nice socks,Good comfortable socks that hold up well. They can be pricey at times and I usually wait till Amazon drops the price lower before buying. Gave them one less star because they tend to leave little black lint balls around a lot I have noticed but no big deal.
3,Beware,"The socks are nice, Amazon.com is great, BUT..if you're ordering these socks as a gift, beware! The price is printed directly on to the paper that holds the socks together. There is no way to get rid of the price without cutting a chunk of that out, which will look tacky. It's too late for me to return them at this point, so I guess I'm going to have to give a gift that says what I paid for it on the front. Ick."
3,You get what you pay for,"At 3 bucks a pair, you simply can't expect nice, comfortable socks. These aren't UNcomfortable, but they don't compare to $10/pair socks like SmartWool, etc. They are quite thin and insubstantial in comparison. I wish I hadn't bought them; now I have 12 pairs of socks that I will probably just give to GoodWill."
1,Black lint everywhere for 2 years now!,"Okay these socks have 80 reviews telling everyone how great these socks are. Really? Men go to Amazon to rave about black socks? I think not. I used to really like this brand, the socks were basic and lasted a long time. I bought these socks 2 years ago and ever since our carpet is constantly littered with black lint. So annoying to look at and to try to vacuum up. I'm writing this review as I have decided to throw these accursed socks away and buy something else that doesn't litter my home! A little more research and common sense on this company's part would not have been a bad idea. I guess they must have hired Reputation Defender to write all these bogus reviews to push up their star rating."
4,"Comfy, but...","Very comfortable, but the black socks like to leave little bits of thread on your feet until the first few washings (and other clothes on the first wash, so be careful)"
5,Eighted and Slowed,"This might be one of the best screw cds i have ever heard. If you like screw and chopped sht then you must cop this. Beltway 8 is full of throwd young playas, Can i Ball, swang left swang right, htown streets, when i die, all great songs, every song is good, if you cant find this cd email me maybe we can do something"
2,Drink homemade root beer,"This root beer had a very good flavor and was light, ice cream is a great selection for this product. I needed to make homemade root beer for drinking. Use dry ice, water, and sugar. This product is see through, and I needed a dark and rich concentrated product. The root beer needed to be stronger for drinking homemade root beet."
5,Works great with Panasonic Lx-3,"I owned a Panasonic LX-3 and this worked perfectly with it and the charger. Enjoyed more battery life putting this in my camera bag for longer trips. I did notice a little less battery life than the OEM, but given the price, it was worth the cost still."
1,Another piece of Chinese made junk,Whats up with this company Lenmar? Their business model appears to be built around cheating the customer. Their batteries don't work as claimed - the last NiMh ones I tried barely had one fourth the advertised capacity. This battery gave about a third of its advertised capacity on a friends camera before it stopped working totally.
5,This is AWESOME l-Arginine...!,"If you take 3000 mg (3 tablets - as instructed on the bottle), about 30 minutes before you lift, you will get the most massive muscle pump you have ever gotten. You will VISUALLY be able to see the increase in muscle size during your workout..! I am still totally amazed after taking this for about 5 years now....!"
1,where is my shipment of NOX3??,I never recieved this product who do I need to talk to for a refund or to send it?
5,"Very large, which made it perfect!","It is a big door stop. We got it in white to cover up a big door knob hole. It seems as if the door stop in place prior to this was also covering up a hole, so it only got bigger when it came off. We needed to cover it A.S.A.P. so we took a chance on it. Works great. Has four adhesive strips and we added gorilla glue to make sure it stayed (wouldn't recommend it though) and so far so good."
4,I can't stop smiling :),"This was my first SEP book. I have been smiling since.SEP writes for the quintessential dreamy eyed girls/ young women who want to cuddle up with some chocolate and a good book on a rainy day.The characters are endearing, the plot is simple but fast paced, the phrasing is touching and most of all the chemistry is spicy. I must read for all those looking for a good Rom-Com.Over all:4 out of 5. Have just ordered my third SEP book in a week. :)"
2,did not even finished,"...so predictable.We don't care for a millionaires any longer, give us a billionaires, from New York, of course.He is certainly falling for a simple, troubled woman and will perhaps get her out of her troubles...why else he is having his billions for?Good touch that he is a good son and tender and caring with his mother.Other than that - not much of excitement.Unless you have too much of a free time to kill, I wont advise to take it in to your hands."
4,Good Value for the Prize,I looked around for a cheap yoga mat and purchased this product. When I first saw the mat it seemed a little bit thin to me but it turned out to be ok. It seems to be impregnated and therefore slippery in the beginning. This goes away after practizing on the mat for a while or washing it. The product is fine for a beginner who doesn't know if he or she wants to go on with Yoga. It is interessting that the prize varies by the color. At the time I purchased it a yellow one was the most expensive so if one doesn't mind the color he or she should look at different ones.
3,thin NOT-sticky mat,"Though it seems denser than other mats, it doesn't offer much cushioning. It's shiny but not sticky, and without that grip my hands are constantly slipping. A disappointment."
1,Very poor quality.,My daughter wanted this necklace and I purchased it against my better judgement. The quality was very poor and the item looked like cheap plastic. She has never worn it.
4,Good product,"This is a good stapler. It is made cheaper than previous models of the same one, but works quite well."
2,Lasted Less Than A Year,"After buying the stapler because it was purported to be long-lasting and heavy duty I was extremely disappointed when it stopped working ~9 months after I purchased it. I use it only a couple times a week to staple 10-15 pages max together.It jammed initially, like a lot of cheap staplers do, then the problem only got worse after that till the point where it won't staple.I gave it 2 stars for lasting 9 months."
1,Bought 4...all of them fell apart!,"The little pin that keeps the top of the stapler aligned with the bottom works its way out with normal use. Once this happens, the stapler jams. It happened to all four staplers that I purchased and I ended up having to throw them all away. Until now, my experience with Swingline products has been nothing but positive."
4,Good enough for me,"Overall the quality of this stapler is good. I don't do a lot of stapling and it has only jammed once out of 100 times, it could have been user error. Most of the material is metal, which i like. The less plastic pieces the better."
5,The only stapler you should consider,"Simple solid, heavy, it works. Buy this and throw the little plastic junk staplers away."
1,The Narration NEVER stops,"This is one of the most annoying Princess games ever. It loads fine on my computer but when your in the game the narration is slow, obnoxious and never stops. 2 mins to explain each game! You can't by pass it! My child got this for Christmas was excited and now..hates it. She's 7 and thinks this is the stupidest game."
1,Not truely XP compatible.,"I also should have read the reviews on this however, my Daughter loves this game. I do not have the problems with sound or graphics as they are very clear on our system. However, my 4 year old now has to have Administrator rights on the system in order to play this game. I bought XP so I could allow the kids functionality on the computer without me hovering over them. I studied how to set the system up for limited users and Administrators (which can do everything), but now all that work and the money for the product are gone. I have made my complaint with Disney as they are the ones that informed me that they have no intention on changing this product."
2,Battery doesn't last long,Battery doesn't last long. 1 full day of of shooting and by end of day battery is dead. I might return it for another one.
1,"DON'T BUY, STAPLES HARD TO FIND!","I received my stapler a while back and have not had the opportunity to even use it. I don't know if I ever will be able to use it. It did not come with staples and the staples are not available for sale at my local Staples office store, or any other stor ein my area. They are rare to find and if you can find them for sale on amazon, you will have to pay a chunk of money for shipping to get them.Not something I want to go thru every time I need staples. Buy a stapler that takes standard staples.The stapler was cheap, so its not worth it for me to return it. Still can't use it, still need a stapler."
3,Lion's House Review,"We used this book to help us write our plan for operating the Lion's House Children's Home. The text is clear and helpful. There are a few mistakes in the printing of our copy, which was annoying, but over all this is a good book for getting the basic idea of how to write a business plan."
5,Fantastic overview some major problems facing the Church,"Von Hildebrand has written many great books on some key problems that exist in the Roman Catholic Church and gives thoughtful reflections in this volume on where ""we should be"". Not a radical conservative or restorationist, he tells it like it is and makes you think. Easy read, but a lot of meat! Highly recommended for anyone who cares about the Church and her future!"
2,Misled by sales guy at BestBuy,"Sales guy said HDMI would handle video and audio. That's why I bought it. Once I got home and read the manual I discovered, as others have, that audio is not transmitted via HDMI and you must purchase additional optical cables. The whole benefit (for me) in HDMI is the superior sound and video quality and ease of using one cable. I am returning it for the HK 247."
3,Good but misleading,"This is a solid component, but beware when it says ""HDMI connectivity."" I bought this model specifically for this feature, figuring the hookups to my HDTV would be simpler and the sound quality would be first rate, but it turns out that the receiver just ""channels"" the HDMI video signal and does not decode the audio that comes with it -- you have to connect separate audio cables anyway. If I had realized this when I was shopping, I would have opted for a model that was half the price. Harman Kardon is a reliable manufacturer, and I've been satisfied with the receiver's sound quality and ease of use, but this was a major drawback for me."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this expecting a soothing naptime cd, what I received was a collection of bell music. I totally did not ever think I'd be subjected to Christmas bell music. I'm not a fan of this cd at all."
2,Instrumental music from a synthesizer,"I was really disappointed with this CD. It sounds like someone made it with a synthesizer. No vocals, just instrumental. It is soothing to some degree, but still not really quality music."
3,First three shows of the series.,This DVD contains the first three shows of the 1954-55 series (all available in larger sets elswhere) starring Ronald Howard as Sherlock Holmes & H. Marion Crawford as Dr. Watson.#1 The Case of the Cunningham Heritage#2 The Case of Lady Beryl#3 The Case if the Pennsylvania Gun
2,Not To Good,"Although the original movies bought separately are great, but the 3 on 1 is terrible. Same movies, but it looks like you are watching them in a smoke filled room that never clears up for an hour or so."
2,Way too melancholic,"I don't know much about Celtic music, but I love the Putumayo collections, and sought to explore more Celtic music when I purchased this, but for the most part it is way too mellow. There are a few nice songs, and I suppose if you're feeling in a reflective mood and you want some fiddle-type melodies to go with it, then by all means."
4,Track Listing,Track Listing1. Thinking It Over (Full Length Version) 4:052. No Clouds (1st Version) 4:143. Greed 3:424. Thinking It Over (video)
2,Skip this one. No chemistry between the hero and heroine! (C- Grade),"McCall is an excellent writer overall but this book is not a good example of her writing. The main problem with the story is there is really no chemisty or connection between Duncan and Aieleanna. The story has an interesting promise- revenge and angst from the hero against the evil sister of Aieleanna, who killed his young wife and tortured him years ago. Duncan means to take it out on her by making Aieleanna his mistress. His overall cruelity forms into affection and love but overall not believable. There is too much emotional seperation for the two and the sudden love from Duncan will make most readers scratch their heads in confusion.On the positive side, McCall can write convicing life during the early middle ages. Too bad this romance is too stale.Katiebabs"
5,Excellent,"I use it to dress my pasta, it is great just with some nice bread and kosher salt. Drizzle it on anything but don't you dare cook with it, it's too good for that."
2,least favorite,I particularly didn't like the portion using the incline with fast paced steps. It feels slightly dangerous and I kept worrying I was going to topple off the darn thing. Love The Firm for weightlifting but I think I'll get my cardio elsewhere.
2,Confusing,"I'm not an aerobics instructor or a super step master but I usually don't have a problem following steps. This video, however, is just confusing. I feel like I get my workout from jumping around trying to figure out what they're doing instead of doing the steps. I'm sure these cues are universal but half the names she calls the steps don't seem to relate to the step at all so it doesn't help me remember what the step is. Plus, there isn't enough repetition of the step for me to see what they're doing to get it down, especially when the camera is roaming around at all different angles. I can't see when it does that! This video transitions to different steps WAY too quickly and the camera doesn't stay on the lead for the 2 seconds she's doing that particular step so it's hard to pick up the move. I feel like I'm repeating myself now but I'm getting frustrated with this video."
1,Cheap Garbage,"I took a shot and I bought this online because of all the good reviews it received. Let me tell you, after one spray, I choked and all night long I smelled like a cheap pimp hanging out on the corner. It smells awful, its cheap stuff seriously!! I dont know how people like this crap, it smells worse than Axe and I would rather wear Axe instead, go figure"
4,Good Intermediate Workout,"I own quite a few Firm workouts; Pam Meriweather is one of the best instructors in the entire series. The workout is only 35 minutes long and focuses solely on sculpting. Although there are some minor cardio segments, in reality, your heartrate does not elevate on this workout. That being said, it's a nice workout when you're not feeling ready to tackle 60 minutes, but want to feel like you are getting something for the effort. It alternates between upper and lower body strength moves. The dips are probably the most challenging as you segue from ""regular"" dips to curtsey dips and back to regular from one segment of the incline."
5,Excellent DVD,"I love this DVD, it goes by very quickly, gives a great all around workout and does not have too many fancy steps. Absolute beginners can do it with no weights and the lower step, then you can increase the weights and step gradually. This is a super little workout!"
4,Pretty good,"This DVD was actually pretty tough, I felt sore the next day. Theres LOTS of weight lifting, including laying on the transfirmer at an incline on your back. The leg work was challenging. I hate dvds that are too easy, and this one is enough of a challenge that I can work up to it more and more each time until I can do everything on it. Excellent!"
3,"Excellent Concept, but Cumbersome","I like the idea of this training aid -- both colors at address & impact, blue on the backswing & yellow after release to finish. I tried this ball a number of times & found it too cumbersome to use, especially to get both arms in the right position by myself. It was quite easy to use with another person positioning it for me, but I like to practice away from the practice range when I have some spare moments to myself. I also think it's overpriced."
4,A perfect summer read!,"The latest passionate thriller from M.J. Rose continues in the vein of her previous success, ""In Fidelity."" Rose's narrative richly develops the family relationship of Genny Haviland and her art dealer parents, delves into the steamy, seemingly ""wrong for each other"" romance of Genny and bad-boy painter Slade Gabriel, evokes the go-go art scene of New York City in the 70s and 80s, and effortlessly weaves a courtroom drama throughout. A perfect summer novel!"
5,American DJ Light Copilot II Automatic Lig...,I purchased this item to use in my DJ business and have had very good luck with it and am very happy with it ... you have a lot of adjustments with lighting using this product .. if you are looking for a lighting controller i recommend it highly ...
1,Bad,I really needed this book and after I ordered it I thought great. Then days later I got an email saying They didnt have it so I was being credited. If you dont have the book DONT POST IT!!
2,Not quite what I expected.,"This is not an ""urn"" in the sense that you have an ashtray on top and somewhere to empty the butts in the bottom. This is simply a round rubber tube with a chrome ashtray on top.NOT what I expected for $60. There are much better bargains to be had if you are looking for an ashtray. Two stars because the heavy rubber body would stand up to heavy use, but still, it's just a big bulky ashtray. Not a smoker's urn."
2,Minor Spoilers & Stupid Spies Ahead,"2 stars.This was a disappointment and I don't think I'll be trying this author again. I might but it's unlikely.I read the first 40 pages and I got bored. So from there I skimmed and skipped the next 150 pages. After that I started reading it more completely again.The last half of the story was good and entertaining. However I did have a problem with one major thing. Simon and James are spies but they both (mostly Simon though) seemed really stupid. There were so many moments where neither Simon nor James figured out what was going on. It made me wonder how are they spies if they are so dumb? I don't mind Simon making a mistake but when he doesn't figure out anything it's more than just a mistake it's stupid. I can explain away James's lack of mental quickness because he had just come back from being captured, drugged, and starved. But Simon had no such excuse.In the end I don't think this author is for me."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","I bought this book based upon the reviews of people here. I also bought the sequel at the same time. I jumped the gun on that one. The heroine was annoying and feeble. The hero was dull as dirt. For the life of me I cannot figure out the appeal of Celeste Bradley's writing. I am on the verge of despair because I feel as if I have read all of the 'good' romance novelists and there is nothing left. Julia Quinn, Lisa Kleypas, Susan Elizabeth Phillips are at the top, followed by Julie Garwood, Christina Dodd, and sometimes Judith McNaught. Who else is as good as these ladies??? Please help."
3,Enjoyable IF you're familiar with the series,"I've now read all the Liar's series in different order, but when I picked up this book, I realized I had tried to read it a year or so ago and found it boring, although I knew nothing of the Liar's and Royal Four at the time. I stuck with it this time, however, and while I still found it a dull love story, I loved Simon, but his appeal, while great here, was also based on his appearances in the other books. Agatha wasn't really in the other series enough to know her well, so I was glad to read her story. She was great, similiar to Willa Trent. So...I'd recommend reading ALL the other books first - they were all perfect, then read this one. I'd hate to see anyone miss out on all those wonderful stories because of this one."
4,Gold toe men's socks,I was a little disappointed in the thickness of the socks. I have bought gold toe socks at a dept. store and they were thicker; but I think they were made with a higher percentage of cotton. These are 84% cotton 14% stretch nylon and 2% spandex. I hope they last as long.
5,As always just great,Been using these for years and always great. As always just great. Beats going to J C Penneys to get them
2,Cheap Socks,I bought a bag of these socks @ Target. I developed holes in every pair i had in the heel of the sock. now im OUT of socks..They are in the garbage..wow! what a surprise...
5,Excellent product,These socks are super comfortable and the retain their shape wash after wash. They worn for 12 hour shift work and the reamin comfortable the entire shift.
4,Good for the price,"These don't seem to be quite as thick as they used to be, but, all in all they are OK for the price."
3,Just OK!!,"I have been wearing Gold Toe Windsor wool socks with many happy feet for as long as I can remember. That being said when I needed some ankle length athletic socks I jumped on these. They are just not what I was expecting. Not as cushioned as I expect athletic socks to be and the sizing was a bit on the small size.On the up side the toe area is classic gold toe and the socks do not shrink much if at all after washing.Like I said in the title, they are just OK."
3,To thick and big,These socks are very nice but they are thicker than I like. They also seem to big. My feet are 8.5~9 and I have never had this problem before. It's not like it is too big a size just more like there is so much extra material that they feel big. Also my feet feel jammed in my shoes when I wear them. Nice quality but weird fit.
4,Good socks,"Perfectly good socks. They seem to hold up well and they're very comfortable. They fit well, too, and I have big feet."
3,Gold Toe Socks Made In Mexico Results In The Decline Of Quality,"I have been purchasing Gold Toe athletic socks for years. Up until recently, the socks were made in the United States and the quality has been outstanding. I realized something was wrong when I purchasedGold Toe Men's Cotton Quarter Athletic Sock, 6-Packand one of the socks had a small hole in it right out of the package, another developed a hole in less than one month; and upon further investigation discovered, in the tiniest of print, the socks were now made in Mexico.In a side by side comparison, it becomes completely evident Gold Toe athletic socks now made in Mexico are not the same high quality nor are they as well made as Gold Toe socks previously made in the United States."
2,Too small,I wear a size 13 men's shoe and these socks are too short in the foot length. They pull back into my toes and creep down the ankle. Do not recommend. Actually tighter and shorter than my older Hanes ankle socks that Hanes doe not make any more. Old ankle socks actually had the heel cup and then a short span of regular knit material before the elastic part of the ankle band. The new ones do not have this extra span of stocking and are themselves the reason I have been searching for a replacement. No luck so far.
1,gold toe quarter socks,Poor quality. 2% spandex should be firm these are not. Not what I have purchased in past. Reminds me of tube socks.
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered several pairs of the gold toe socks, and am extremely disappointed with them. After just a few weeks of normal wear and care, several of them have holes in the toes. Unfortunately, I don't think there is much else I can do other than alert other potential buyers of this product. What a waste of money."
5,Mmmmmm!,This perfume smells soo good! I first got it on my honeymoon in San Francisco and have been in love with it ever since! It has a very vanilla-ish smell....but even better!
5,Very satisfied customer,"I love, love, love my Hanae Mori Blue Butterfly parfum! It was received in excellent condition and in a very timely manner. This parfum is a light, clean smelling product. Every time I wear this scent, I get loads of compliments and questions like ""where can I get it?"" My man loves it, too. Can't ask for better than that!"
4,Super Hair Dryer,"Small size, lots of heat and easy mounting, cord length good no need to strech when mounted at optimum hight."
2,OUCH!,"I had a different wall mount dryer that died on me and was trying to find something that would last longer (I had the last one for a few years but...) so I purchased this item based on the reviews. I was disappointed in the quality of the dryer. The wall mount itself was flimsy and there is no filter on the back to clean out and keep your hair from being sucked into the back. Unless I am very careful, my hair gets sucked into the fan in the back and ripped out of my head. I will use it until it dies but I would not purchase this product again."
1,Only lasted 2 months!,"We purchased this item January 3, 2011 for my daughter's bathroom. We installed it the following week. She uses a hairdryer infrequently, about once or twice a week. She informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting. Sure enough, I just checked it out. No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response. I will update what (if anything) customer service does about this situation. Until then, I am giving this item one star."
5,koga,we both love koga..in fact we both love inuyasha...koga being part of them is one way of keeping the kits
4,Almost perfect,"I'm a lover of FIRM videos for a reason: They are the best out there. This series is no exception. The moves are good, and the music is great. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the new TransFIRMer is large and somewhat difficult to move into new positions. That said, it's by no means a reason to not buy the system. The new box allows for new moves that stretch and tone parts that the other boxes weren't able to get to. Overall, it's a good purchase."
3,Not good if you'r a beginner,"This is not what I expected, I was pretty dissapointed. I guess if you'r not new to step aerobics then you would enjoy it. I think they were going way to fast for beginners like me. Hopefully once I get the hang of it, I will enjoy it. I do think they should have a seperate dvd for beginners to use. :("
3,Venerable early Schutz recording,"Rudolf Mauersberger (1889-1971) did a great deal to rediscover Schutz for modern audiences. Amongst the reissues on Berlin Classics this 2CD set of the complete Geistliche Chormusik of 1648 is one of the most valuable. For those wanting the traditional cathedral choir sound this is the recording to go for. For those wanting a more modern ""authentic performance"" sound the set by Hennig (if available) or the 1998 Cordes performance on CPO will be preferred."
2,Poor quality AMBER??,"Just replacing these bulbs in a 2003 Avalanche because the Amber color all peeled and fell off inside the light housing and we can't get it all out. Not sure what to replace them with, maybe LED?"
2,`no sirve en venezuela,hi i am from venezuelaand I can not set the time properly...everyday the time changePLEASE HELP ME TO SET THE TIMEI REALLY LOVE THIS CLOCK
1,This clock does not come with a manual!,"I did spend some time searching for this STUPID product's STUPID manual (totally channeling one of my teens now) and finally found one at this address. [...]I AM STILL VERY UNHAPPY! Okay, I totally get not wanting to waste paper with stupid manuals! I even support it! But, make sure you note this when you send your wretched product!!!! I shouldn't have to waste even 15 seconds of my time looking for it! AS IF!!!!"
4,memei,"We are very pleased with our new projection clock. It's not too bright on the ceiling that it bothers our sleep. We do not like seeing light during our rest. I also like the compact size, as it does not distract from the decor in our bedroom."
2,embryology,"I actually really like the book itself-the author has a away of making a complex subject approachable. She is articulate, and is a well respected professor of embryology/anatomy.I highly reccomend the book-just not the bookseller.The book was supposed to be in good condition-and it had highlighter, and ink notes throughout the book. I am always careful to select booksellers who have high ratings-so I don't know what they were thinking. The book I received was not worthy of sale.The seller contacted me, and advised me that I could send it back for a refund-but I required it to create a lecture-and ""made do"".I recommend caution when using used book sellers."
3,A problematic overview and introduction,"I wouldn't recommend this book as an introduction to Buddhism and it's teachings. For that, I would turn to Smith and Novak's introductionBuddhism: A Concise Introductionor Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche's Joy of LivingThe Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness. Lopez is indeed a scholar, and provides here a pleasant and erudite archaeological survey of Buddhist practice and organization, with a particular focus on the legends that animate these practices. Oddly, he recounts these legends mostly as fact. He has a particularly strong focus on esoteric Tibetan Buddhist rituals, and also on Pure Land philosophy. Not all readers will find these particularly relevant. His text is clear, and will probably appeal most to intermediate or advanced readers who wish to get a further grounding in Buddhist philosophical history."
5,"a classic whodunit, and much more","While one cannot deny the absolute superiority of A Very Long Engagement, I found One Deadly Summer to be the most enjoyable among the rest of Japrisot's oeuvre. This is one instance where his powers come through with a distinctive flair, upon the themes that echo through all of his work: droplets of truth gathering through a confusion of voices, the sheer blindness of love, the eternal mystery that is woman, the infinite sadness of human error, and the surprises and tragedies that is life itself. How much of the world, and others, do we really ""understand""?"
4,Recommended,"Got to agree with the other reviews, this is an excellentcollection. Just played this at a conference as ""wallpaper""music, but it's the one they all asked about!"
5,Amazing CD!!!,"I saw this band on tour last year and they were awesome! So, naturally, I was super excited when I found out I could buy their albums online! The CD is wicked! The blend of celtic, funk and disco is so unique and creative combo. If you buy this, order 2 and give one to a friend. I guarantee you'll love it."
1,memory card did not work with my mobile,"even though my mobile phone (nokia N72) specified it can handle RS-MMC cards, this memory card did not work with my mobile. it's a total waste of money"
5,Safe Bet,Safe is just the right size to hold my valuables. It appears to be of quality construction. It is light enough to be moved around but heavy enough to be a deterent to theft. Combination lock and closure devices work smoothly. Exterior and interior finish is very nice. Overall a good value for the money.
2,This isn't a safe.,"This safe might keep your wife out, but it isn't going to keep a thief out. I was robbed and they got into this thing with a sledge hammer and a chisel in what looked to be about 5 minutes. I guess something is better than nothing, but my new safe is from Fort Knox and it weighs 700 pounds. Do your research on safes before you trust your firearms or heirlooms to this."
3,The Seems are not well sewn,I love the design and my son does too but the Pillow case after 1 was the seem was coming apart had to resew other wise great!! fast Shipping
2,A mixed bag,"This book provides thorough, easy-to-understand information about a much-maligned but wonderful means of planning a family. Unfortunately, I hesitate to recommend it to others because of its strident tone. The Kippleys' insistence on doing things their way is frustrating at times. (How many times do they say co-sleeping families should buy a king-sized bed with no headboard? Is that a moral imperative? I don't think so.) The book is frequently pharisaical and smug. And there is a section on maintaining a happy marriage by freshening up before hubby comes home and acting like you care about his political views that makes me cringe.I hope that in the next edition of this book they'll stick to the facts about the method and the theology that informs their work, and leave the editorializing out."
4,"Great book, life changing","This has been very helpful to my husband and I in our quest to learn NFP. As practicing Catholics', we find the information extremely valuable and encouraging. Thankful that this product even exists for couples--it is a great way to bring the focus of your marriage back to what God intended and it definitly brings you closer as a couple if you practice this together."
5,Still going strong...,"I purchased the Spalding Never Flat Football about a year ago. After much abuse it is still fully inflated, just like the day I received it.It is made of strong durable material that cleans up easily after a day in the mud.I highly recommend this football as it is the best I have ever purchased."
3,"""Blaxploitation the Hammer Man)style""","Former NFL,grid iron great Fred Williamson.Aka the ""Hammer"",from all them spectacular hit's as a Kansas City Chief,defensive lineman!If you were a born in 68' and growing up in the 70's era kid like myself.Then you could appreciate your parent's taking you to the theatre on a Sat. night.To see movie's like this.Also other's like ""Hell Up In Harlem"",""Buck Town"" and ""Three The Hard Way"".Other Fred Williamson movies.Buy it...if anything to ad to your collection!!!"
1,a blow to the creationist movement...,"Books like this turn Christians away from science and nonChristians away rfom the bible. The distortions to basic physics and math is incredible. The author also seems to think an ""old-earth"" means one believes in evolution, it does not. His association to AIG makes this all the more dubious because the AIG is well known for its unbiblical tactics, its attacks on believers, biblical distortions and bad science. For real biblical studies of science, see Don Stoner's ""A new look at an old Earth (1997)"" or Hugh Ross' ""Creation and time (1994)."""
1,A very sad book,"A previous reviewer stated ""This book is very scientific"". It isn't. Dr. Humphreys has decided what the facts are (from the Bible as HE interprets it) and then twisted physics to fit. That's not science, it can't be proven wrong, because whatever occurs will be twisted to fit the ""facts"". It is always very sad when this sort of rubbish is put forward as an intelligent Christian worldview! At least the IDS mob have a bit more integrity.As a previous reviewer stated Dr. Humphreys is no ignorant creationist, having received a Ph.D. in Physics from Lousiana State University. this makes it all the more depressing that he can publish such a poorly argued book. However a Phd is no guarantee of sense (I've got one!). Moreover the comment about having had his theory puiblished in the peer-reviewed Technical Journal is disingenuous. It's not peer-review that counts it's the quality of the journal and there's no way that this would be published in any real physics journal."
1,Laughable tool,"I have owned two of these saws (each one for a few minutes). The first one ran for about 3 seconds (with no load on it) before completely dying. I returned it and, unfortunately, requested a replacement instead of a refund. The second one lasted almost 30 seconds while actually cutting a 1-inch limb, then it died. I am about to return the second one for a refund. Henceforth, I will steer clear of Skil products!!!"
3,Business Intelligence,"The book could be an invaluable tool for designing SOA-based business intelligence. However, many typing errors exist in the text. Some statements in the book appear to contradict each other. The discussion on the business intelligence, Chapter 5, is difficult to follow. For example Figure 5.4 is very unclear. Specifically, how do the data from the dimensions in the data warehouse move from the data warehouse to the MQE? Where is the link from the data warehouse to the MQE? If the author can clean up all these issues, the book could be an excellent one for designing SOA-based business intelligence."
4,starts out slow but gains value; good overview of technologies used in SOA,"I was going to stop reading after Ch 2 of this book, since it was way more than I wanted to know about bulldozers, but Chapter 3 got into some useful information and detail on how the technologies integrate. Each chapter built and finally tied it all together: how BPM, BPML, BPEL, BI are used in SOA. Good big picture overview of all the technologies role. I especially enjoyed the discussion of brokers to retrofit legacy apps."
3,hmmm,"i was hooked with the first song, and after that it got a little less interesting. Still, it is an album worth buying, its poptastic and brit sounding, a little like metric with a more narcissistic beat."
2,She's No DeLarrocha,"Ute Weyand is a young (mid-thirties) German pianist resident in Spain who had earlier recorded some Granados piano music to some acclaim; I've not heard that recording. Here she plays all the piano music of Manuel de Falla. Much of this music -- the major pieces (Fantasia Betica, Cuatro Piezas Espanolas, Allegro de Concierto) -- has been previously recorded gloriously by Alicia de Larrocha. And therein lies the problem with this CD. Weyand simply is not in the same league as de Larrocha when it comes to limning, with utter accuracy, clarity and feeling, the intricacies of the music. At times, indeed, her playing seems tentative, with flabby rhythms, misaligned right and left hands. Sometimes the pianist seems to be on autopilot, and at other times as if she is trying hard simply to get in all the notes.My advice would be to avoid this one.Scott Morrison"
3,"Not so wide, wheel carriage is very approximate fit","It's a Ok-deal, but the wheel carriage is really cheap. It does not fit thight the chest and the chest is moving quite a bit on this base. I'd expected a better fit.The inside width is likely some standard size as the picture shows folders neatly organized inside. However I don't have such neat folders, and trying to stick bunch of important official letters inside it's just not wide enough. So my letters are on the diagonal and I waste a lot of space. I think a front-opening chest would probably avoid this issue."
1,a bad purchase!,these cleats just won't stay on any of the boots i wear. they always come off after a couple of steps. I would not recommend these to anyone.
5,These are not only for Smurfs but real people who walk on ice as well!,"These ice cleats- if worn, will most likely keep you from busting your ass. Wearing these I can walk on a downhill slope of solid slick ice with complete confidence. Depending on your shoe profile you may need to order a size up. If it's a normal shoe then normal then normal sizing will work. If it's a big boot or large soled shoe- go a size up. In normal icy conditions on flat ground other cleats seem to work fine but when the ice is smooth and slick and on a slope and wet- these work great! It is the cleats on the heel that save me from becoming a victim of gravity. It really is amazing how hard and fast a person can fall when not wearing these ice cleats."
4,Great Product,Arrived 2 days early. Sturdy construction. A bit touchy with wet ice but still a big improvement. I have recommended this to my friends.
4,Helpful item for winter safety,"This is a great item when walking on driveways, sidewalks, and slick parking lots. It helps you grip fantastically in snow and ice. Not good on decks/porches, but otherwise great product. Sturdier than other shoe-grip slide-ons I've used before."
4,Ran very small. Order larger if you have boots or shoes with big heals...,I wear a size 13 shoe and the XL for size 13.5 to 15 barely fit my shoe. At first I thought they made a mistake and checked the size. Yes they are XL and yes they barely fit a size 13!
5,These are great.,"As a senior,living in a rural area,I am very wary of ice. The path to my chicken house and greenhouse was solid ice this month.I tried ski poles but they didn't help much. I found this product and like magic I was able to stride out to do my chores.I highly reccomend them. My husband has now ordered a pair."
3,Good price. Design flaw.,The first time out in deep snow and ice the Stabilizers came off the boots a few times. I finally kept them off. I bought Velco straps to help hold the Stabilizers on the boot.
5,Stabilcers are a great product,I have bought them for myself and my husband. I can't walk our dog in Minnesota winters without them. This year I bought them for my son-in-law and granddaughter who live on an icy bluff in Wisconsin. They make all the difference in being outside and feeling secure with treacherous conditions underfoot.
4,Definte review this winter,"I can't review this item because I have not been able to use it because it's Spring time. I do know that the product seems to bealot sturdier than the last pair I had. I had to toss them afterone year. What I like is that it has spikes instead of spiral wires that tend to unwrap,& break off. I will get back to you this winter, but from the looks of this product I feel this will be a winner."
1,Fit problems,"The cleats will not stay on your boots, I have size 11 hunting boots and ordered a size large, I had to take decoy line and tie around the boots so they will not fall off. They might be good for easy walking city goers but will not hold up for serious trekking or ice fishing."
2,Does not meet my expectations,"My husband hiked about 1/4 mile up a hill in 8 inches of snow to feed the horses using this product over high rubber boots. The stabilizers kept slipping off although they appeared to be a good fit when put on - took some stretching to apply them over the boots. Furthermore, by the time he returned, three cleats were missing. After just one wearing, the rubber was also split on one side. Would not recommend this product!"
4,A good product but maybe a bit small,"I've only put these on once so far and they seem like they will do the trick.However the picture shows them in a boot and the sizes are more for your normal tennis shoe.They do fit over the boot but I think in time the rubber will break do to over expansion. My size is 9.5 and they say it will fit to a size 10, but if ordered again I will go 10 to 12 instead."
4,Great fit for my size 13 man,"I bought these because my husband wears size 13 shoes and has trouble finding socks that are long enough but hates tube socks. He loved these, they are comfortable and cheaper than purchasing them from the manufacturer. The only thing that I didn't like is that it was $9 more to purchase them in black."
5,Wonderful socks,"I received these socks as a gift and have been using them regularly for nine months. All of the Gold Toe pairs that I own are still in great condition.They're very durable as I walk around the house without my shoes often, they are comfortable in and out of shoes and they look great with shorts, unlike longer socks and most other ankle socks.I will definitely get these socks again whenever I need new ones and I highly recommend them!"
2,Too small for my size 13 foot,"I ordered these because they are advertised as being extended size for people who wear sizes 12 to 16 shoes, but they do not fit comfortably on my size 13 feet. These socks are much smaller than I expected. I've previously purchased socks listed as being for size 10 to 13 that fit much better than these ""extended size"" socks do.If they were sized as advertised, I'd probably rate these socks a 3 or 4.If you wear size 13 or larger shoes, I recommend buying some other brand of sock."
3,GOOD SOCKS IF YOU AREN'T EXERCISING,"I bought these socks when I'm not walking long distances and I found them to be ok. I bought pairs of Wig-Wam men's Ironman Thunder pro socks and am really happy with those. You get what you pay for so for just an everyday sock for short walks or around the house, these are alright. They start to fall down with an exercise."
4,Good product...interesting time putting up,"The overall product is good. Solid materials. The starting nails, however, aren't worth much. After hammering the start nails supplied in the shipment, the heads popped off after after a few hits. I resorted to some wood screws that I had from a previous project.The first unit is going to the hardest to put up. Afterwords, the rest of the units go up fairly quickly because you know what you're doing and you get used to working on the ceiling."
5,One of the BEST Sweet Valley books!!,I gave this book 5 stars because this book is great! I f you like books that have a great ending then I suggest you most definetly read this book!
2,low fall brief,Unfortunately the band is not wide enough to hold them up and they keep falling down. Material is great and comfortable. Would be a five if they made the band a little wider to hold them up.
3,"Good Stapler, Bad Staples","I read all the available reviews as of March 3, 2012. I have owned one for about five years. I found that the stapler is OK as long as you don't get too close to it's maximum capacity (60 sheets). The stapler doesn't ""jam"" the staples fail. I find that they aren't heavy enough to always make it through the stack of paper. The stapler usually pushes the staple through the machine but the staples fail and crumple up in the stack of paper (so there I am with a pair of pliers pulling the wad of wire out of the paper). Once that happens, then the game begins with trying to align the new staple through the failed staple hole so maybe I can get it to work on the second (usually the 3d or 4th) try. it can be very frustrating. I think I'm asking too much of it and am now after a large capacity stapler."
2,Wrong picture!,"I received this item in timely fashion. The problem is I was expecting what was pictured, not what I received. The picture shows a brass spring doorstop. I received an ANTIQUE brass doorstop. It does say that in the description but the picture is very misleading."
2,Not a very good book,"The book is a collection of explanation and examples from the help database of Domino and this does not justify anything for the money paid to it.There is very minimum amount of info on important topics like Applets etc. where it has just one chapter on the applet.It is more of a remake of Help database, with 75% of the material similar to the Help.It would have been useful to the user if there was more explanation and examples."
4,Pretty darned good,"As a mystery fan, I am always looking for new series to follow. I enjoyed this debut, although it might not have the same tightness of story as some others. There are interesting characters staffing the Aberdeen Police force, not least of which is the hero, DS ""Lazarus"". The crimes are suitably creepy, without giving me nightmares, with plenty of suspects and twists and turns. Aberdeen is portrayed as continually rainy, almost hard to believe that it could be so unrelievedly wet. I look forward to the next in the series, if only to find out whether the sun ever shines in Aberdeen!"
3,Enough killers to go around,"The Chamber of Commerce should pay this guy not to write. Never, outside of a sci-fi hell, ever been less likely to visit a setting. Cold, wet and uninviting. Even a careless reader can find half a dozen suspects. They all did it."
5,"cold, dreich and gritty!","First book that I have read by this author. Liked the writing style. Good solid 3D characters and in a thoroughly believable freezing cold 3D north of Scotland setting. I just finished the book yesterday and am missing the characters already and glad to find out this was the first in a series about Logan the main character. The story itself is gritty without the violence being gratuitious though the theme is not for the faint hearted. There is just enough wit and sarcasm to keep it entertaining and engaging...... Right , time to go get book 2!"
4,"Good, Solid Mystery","Overall, I enjoyed this police procedural even though I found the first part of the book a bit slow to get going.I am very glad that I persevered because the story really gained momentum in the second half.Children are being abducted and murdered in Aberdeen and there is very little for the police to go on. It falls to D.S Logan McRae who has returned from sick leave to find the culprit. There are different investigations running concurrently as the Scottish police race to find the perpetrator before another child goes missing.The book was surprisingly funny in places with some excellent repartee/ one liners between characters that broke up the grimness of the storyline. As another reviewer has pointed out the main character, D.S Logan McRae was level headed without the usual vices and angst found in other police procedurals. The supporting cast were well portrayed and fleshed out with the exception of D.S MacRae's old love interest Pathologist, Isobel MacAllister........"
1,"Brutal; Gory Murders, Foul Language","I found this book very disturbing and hard to take from page 1. There were graphic descriptions of autopsies and horrible murders; nasty perpetrators; sickening scenes; and a lot of foul language. The scenes described in Scottish slang were hard to understand but I caught the gist. I guess I’ll need to avoid the UK murder stories. It had a large number of typos, and missing paragraph separations, so that the action ran together when there should have been a passing of time shown. It does have appeal if you like gore and disgusting murders. Oh, yes, the candy quirk by Insch was annoying and useless. I agree with another reviewer about that."
1,cheated,"The five star reviews must have been written by friends of the authors. It's the only possible explanation. Full of spelling and grammatical errors, it reads like a mediocre high school short story that never ends. The writing is clumsy and heavy handed, the characterization is preposterous. It is, however, useful for other writers as a compendium of what not to do. I normally refrain from such criticism, but I bought this book on the strength of the reviews, most of which, in hindsight, sound suspiciously like back page blurbs drafted up by the 'authors' themselves. If you've ever had unkind thoughts toward the major book selling chains for not being more supportive of self published novels, this book will give you some insight into why they may hesitate."
1,This edition is awful,"This edition is horrible. It is peppered with inexcusable typos. Within the first few pages, there are two instances in which it should say ""though"" but it says ""thought"" instead. If this edition makes blatant errors like that, it will surely fail to deal adequately with the nuances of translating the work into English. DO NOT BUY!"
5,Great product!,"These are just plain great for garage storage. I put up 3 in my garage and 1 on my dock. Very easy to install. Only problem I had is with abuse by UPS on one shipment resulted in lost components, but Amazon provided pick up for return and immediate replacement. I love Amazon for this since they did not make me hassle with UPS."
5,organization bliss,"Once you have all the pieces laid out and your measurments done installation is a snap. I highly recommend using cordless power tools for every nut and bolt, it ""GREATLY"" increases installation time. Once installed its a very sturdy and trustworthy design. There is slight side to side movement that is easily rectiifed. The system freed up so much floor space and is appealing to the eye. The product is worth every cent and second of instalation."
4,A great book.,"This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. I could not put it down. It was a little hard to follow in parts, but overall it was a great book. A real page turner."
3,"Good, lazy read","Hiaasen's ""Sick Puppy"" is a spoof on modern-day consumerism and destructionism, complimented by a larde side of sarchasm. The language is not meant for the cultivated reader, quite a lot of vulgarity and sexual references, but if you're just looking for an easy, relaxing read, this will do it for you.Entertainig but not intellectual."
4,If I Were a Dog,"Really good Hiaasen book. The second Rhino shoot is a riot to read, and I loved the way he wrote some parts of the book from the dogs point of view, it's not too often that we get to go inside the canine mind.Highly recommend as entertaining read."
2,"A Waste Of Paper, A Waste Of My Time","Some humor, but mostly pretty boring. I had to force myself to continue reading it after two or three chapters."
5,Gotta Love Carl and Skink!,"Another great book from Carl Hiaasen. This is the best brain candy I can find, have read all of his books and looking forward to the next. Thanks, Carl!"
5,In one word...,Hilarious. I could not put this book down. I found myself laughing outloud at many times during this book. This is my first book by this author but I am going to explore his other works.
2,"Too much sex, too much violence, too little plot!","The plot of Sick Puppy, when there was one, was fantastic and fun to read. Unfortunately, this made up only about 40% of the novel. The rest was sex and graphic violence (way too many characters were run over by bulldozers.) There can be some of this in a book, but there was just too much in this one. IF however, lots of sex and graphic violence doesn't bother you, I recommend the book simply to read about Twilly Spree and his anger management issues."
3,"Read these themes before, in much more textured and novel form...","One part distilled Floridian weirdness, one part Kurt Vonnegut simplicity and wit, and one part John Irving fringe sexuality, the story gains speed but never takes off, trapped in a house of literary echoes done much better elsewhere. A hitman who loves 911 calls put to classical music? A land developer without a conscience? A painfully ideological twentysomething in search of love via an older woman? These are familiar extremists without extreme texture, and none of them benefit from bumping into the others. The strokes are too broad for any real humanity; only those with a Florida address could find earnestness in this lukewarm survey of the state's primary players."
5,"Not the best, but plenty good enough","As others here have written, all of Carl Hiaasen's books have certain similarities. To some this is formulaic; to others, he is continuing to give his faithful readers what they expect when they buy his books. Anyone who has read more than one CH book will know what I mean. Unfortunately, this book will not be read by those who OUGHT to be reading it: litterbugs, real estate developers, big game hunters, cigar smokers, members of the NRA - everyone whom CH, and his characters, want to teach a lesson. Those who are his fans, however, will not be disappointed. While this book is not quite up to the level of Double Whammy, it is true to the CH tradition, which puts it in my highest category - worth pre-ordering in hardcover. Which is what I will do with his next release. I only wish I could meet Skink in real life; we could use him up here in New York."
3,"Lot's of characters, Lots of twists","I was recommended this book to read because I felt like I was running out of ones I liked. This normally wouldn't be one I would of picked, when you first start the read it's full of comedic moments and made me laugh out loud but then it twist and gets serious and after some time a bit dry. A lot of characters with all there back grounds wriiten out in some times to lengthy of detail and I found myself saying come on let's get on with it, What else did Twilly do? The ending for me I thought would be explosive or fun because that is how the book began but of course it seems to end and me look for additional pages to read - like that can't be it. Then of course looking online to find the series, and no, no series.It was a interesting fun read and a small glimpse into those over exsessive tree huggers - although I am one but not crazed. It's a good summer read or just something to change it up a bit because it is definitly different in everyway.."
3,Appropriate Title,"The very first couple of pages were pretty disturbing for me, as I don't usually read this kind of book. I kept reading though, and I was compelled to finish reading. It was an interesting read, but too much violence and graphic descriptions of things that go on (even though this was fiction, one has to believe in the world of American politics that some of the incidents could have some truth to them).I would probably not read another book from this author, I do not like some of the characterizations nor the graphic violence and his ""sick"" sense of humor."
4,Weird is the new normal,"I first read a few snippets from a book all about golf by Carl Hiaasen. I decided if the man could make the most boring sport in the world so funny, I was almost peeing my pants,he must be really gifted in the humour department.I don't know how to characterize this book, its a hybrid of mystery and absurbist humour. ( Kind of in the vein of 30 rock or canadian bacon) This is the strangest book, I have ever read. Its about a tree hugging hippie with anger problems , a litterbug lobbyist who has no self awareness whatsoever, a drug dealer with a sick barbie fetish and a determination to get a multimillion dollar real estate project going at any cost and a hitman that listens to 9-1-1 tapes accompanied with classical music as a hobby. If that doesn't make you wanna read it nothing will."
4,The Perfect Summer Read in any Toxic Paradise,"I have read all of the Hiaasen novels since 1993 when a good friend in IRELAND first told me about ""Skin Tight"". ""Sick Puppy"", although more introvertedly humorous, still produces the occasional belly laugh. Characterizations are Hiaasen's strength with the narative being secondary. In ""Sick Puppy"" the title drives the book, a metaphor for both it's protagonist and the wealth of secondary eccentrics. LONG LIVE SKINK!"
4,A little disapointed,The product itself was good however it was shipped US mail and the mail carrier SHOVED it in my mailbox and broke the headband =( which kinda messed up the whole costume. Sizes run a little small but not enought to order up. Quality of the product was good but I would have rather it had been delivered to the door or pick it up rather then shoved in the mailbox. Again product was great my issue was with the mail carrier and not the company.
2,Don't waste your money... it does not work well w/ sodas (i.e. gingerale),"Purchased this item for a large thanksgiving function at my home and the it barely worked. It does not work well with carbonated beverages such as gingerale. It will work after about 1 hour (after the gingerale gets FLAT). It will work fine for NON-carbonated beverages. Specifically it just stopped working after we poured the gingerale in the fountain. While we waited for the soda to get FLAT we used a punch bowl ladle to pour the soda. One other downside is that the fountain splatters/sprays a fine mist of beverage in the air, therefore at the end of the day you will need to wipe table area where it was located really well. Soda/punch (anything with sugar) gets sticky by the end of the day."
5,why so high?,this is one of my favorite books of the season for kindergarden I have to borrow it from the public library and we home schoolers and private schools are competing for a single copy why is it so expensive?
4,satisfied,I am satisfied with my purchase of First Alert 2087F .94 cubic ft safe. Reviews had me worried a bit but the safe came unharmed and the only time the combination didn't work was the very first time before I read the instructions. You just have to turn knob several times in a certain direction to zero it out before you do step 1. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star is I haven't seen it go though a fire or flood. I hope I never have to test that part of the safe.
3,get what u pay for,For dirt cheap speakers they sound okay. They have no bass abstain ever. If you pull all bass from them they have okay mid and high range
4,Does what it should,It blows compressed air. Is there much to review? Use it to clean out dust from your computer or whatever else you want to do with it.
4,Good Stuff!,"I loved this book. I've read quite a few Custer books, and there was not much written about Tom. I was thrilled to discover this book was out there, and I hastened to purchase it. Tho I have a lot of other Custer books I haven't read yet, I tore into this immediately.I was impressed by the amount of research author Carl F. Day put into it. It showed. The book is one I wished someone with the thoroughness of Carl Day had written long ago.There is a lot more to Tom Custer than I had previously imagined. I knew some things that were in all the other books, but the bulk of Day's work was very new to me.I think Mr. Day made Tom as human as possible. I know when I was done with the book, I felt real sadness at the loss of this - what I see now was - an incredible man.You don't need a dictionary by your side with this. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. It's a real page-turner.Thank you, Mr. Day, for giving Tom Custer your time and talent."
4,enjoy!,you ll love this book too! enjoy!!! read it aloud to your kids or even neices/nephews/ or any other young kids!
1,The Legend of the Laughing Gecko: A Hawaiian Fantasy,"I would like very much to give a glowing review; however, I have not yet received this item. I ordered in on December 5 and now it is January 6 and I still have not received the book."
2,Not the same classic!,"Great to experience the novela once again, but buyer beware. The soundtrack has been dubbed over with new music. It is a hack job, it appears half the show is re-edited and cut out. It's not the same classic, regurgitated as a run-of-the-mill, everyday novela.Es muy padre ver esta novela de nuevo, pero usted tenga pendiente si compra este video. La musica esta cambiada, la novela esta cortada, y ahora parece como qualquier novela. No es la misma clasica que era antes."
5,It's so CUTE!,"I bought it from Dinsey's Store. I like it very much when someone's calling, Mickey moving- hand pointing at the phone and head moving too. It also said five different messages. When the inspector came and checked my home, he noticed the Mickey moving when the call came in. He said it is cool.It is cool. I wanted one in the past but it was not animated and I am lucky to have an animated one right now instead of old one."
1,The murder of a princess. An investigational analysis of the,"I found this book to be very confusing. It was filled with typographical errors and grammar mistakes. I am not a writer but I spotted grammar errors immediately. The author rambles and changes thought in a paragraph. One example is when he is discussing Diana's loving to eat and always wanted seconds. Next paragraph, he jumps to the history of Queen Victoria. It is a very difficult and boring read. I wasted my money on this one."
3,could be lush-er (is that a word? whatever),"Lush is one of those great bands of the 90's that never got proper recognition (at least in north america anyways). This album has a few good tracks on it, but does not compare to the pure blissful shoegazeing trip that spooky and split induce. This album is more pure pop.....less intriguing...but still worth a listen.What the hell is with the artwork anyways?RIP chris A."
3,Potential hazard and more.,"I just got a 4580-04 and will be swaping out for a unit more than double the price. The unit has lots of power, no problem there. I found the base plate hard to adjust, even though it is supposed to be easy to adjust. Maybe Im just an idot, but things just did not work out with the base. The blower seems to work okay(after I figured out I had the switch in the wrong position), and the built in light and quick change blade system are nice and work well.Where I have a problem with this jigsaw is the handle and trigger. It is designed to be squeezed with two or three finger and has no safety button. When you go to pick it up or put it down, you have to grip the handle with you thumb, ring finger and pinkie finger, or you will turn the unit on. I found this awkward and potentially dangerous. I think I will opt for a little better unit.This jigsaw is fine if the shoe and handle don't bother you."
5,Helped me immensely,I am just now picking up Texas Hold em even though I played for several years using my own intuitions and lost a bundle. This book has made the game much easier to play for me because now I have excellent guiding principles. Burton's style of writing is to the point and he sprinkles a lot of personal anecdotes in the book that really help us to get a feel for the game.
4,Excellent,"The film is quite good. I enjoyed it, the actors/actress' fit their parts extremely well. The music is a bit too much. It was like DUM DUM DUMMMMM made you'd think someone had died or something but turned out she was just asking a question."
5,Another Hayley Mills movie.,"I was so excited to finally get this movie!It was nice to have Hayley's real father,John Mills in it as well as Deborah Kerr.I enjoyed each of the characters and thereare lessons to learn and satisfying action.Nice to enjoy a movie the whole family can watch."
3,"Ok, but not what I needed","This book is nice in that it has couples with a variety of small weddings explain what they did and their budget. I was hoping for more of a smaller scale planning guide, which this is not. No checklists or anything. Better to flip through than as a resource."
1,Stains!!!!,"The first time I used these pans I got unremovable stains on them, and I had just made soup! They stain way too easily!"
5,Excellent-,I have owned a cuisinart stock pot for several years and use it all the time. One can not beat the sear that a stainless pot provides. The new set is just as good. I have been using the stainless more and more and the hard anodized that it replaces less and less. (There is a reason that the cooking show chefs all use stainless). Just remember to use a lower heat than you normally do since these pans seem to heat up faster and hotter.
2,"Good looking, shiny but not worth it","Amazon was excellent. I recieved the pans on time. The pans are horrible when it comes to fire contact. Yes, you use less heat because they heat up very fast,but almost all food sticks to the pan. They are very very very hard to clean too. If you love decorations, these pans are excellent because of the shine, but if you want to cook tasty not burnt food, I do not recommend buying these pans. Find some thing different."
2,Hopoless one,"This is a useless product .When I first used it gave out a white foamy liquid .I tried using 2-3 times after that but same thing happened ,thought selected a bad product so did not wish to return."
5,Works as needed.,"Sturdy container, works as needed. Used to clean computer parts. Probably a little more expensive compared to going out and buying a box of Dust-Off from Best Buy, but if that doesn't matter then go for it."
3,stapler,Stapler is working well so far. It is a little bit tiny for my tastes but it gets the job done. Seems like a good quality stapler. I really hope this stapler lasts me more than a year considering most staplers I spend over $20 on at the office stores do not seem to last long. But so far it is a worthwhile little stapler.
5,GREAT Stapler,"This is a very heavy, very sturdy stapler. It almost never jams and can easily staple through many pages. I think you would have to try to actually break it and even then, you might fail!"
5,Stanley Bostitch Desktop Stapler MOdel B2200BK,"This stapler is extremely reliable and compact. It doesn't jam. It doesn't mangle the staples. I prefer it slightly to the 2500 model because it is more compact and a little heavier. It is vastly superior to swingline or staples brand staplers and although not carried by Office Depot or Staples, it is easy enough to obtain online through Amazon"
3,Adequate replacement speakers,"I purchased these speakers to replace the stock speakers in the back of my truck. They fit in the stock openings which were tight to begin with. There isn't much bass to them, the mids and highs are sufficient. In my opinion these are good replacements for stock if you have no option with depth, etc. but don't expect an upgrade."
2,Have to open it after every staple,"I use the bostitch brand staples that came with this stapler.For the first several strips staples, everything was fine. This is great for making booklets.However, after that, the ""anti-jam"" mechanism prevents feeding the next staple.I have to open the loading head and re-close it after every staple.Once every 10 staples, it will simply be stuck, but usually, it just feeds down without actually pushing a staple into the paper.This is the same problem I had with Bostitch brand staplers 30 years ago.It's very frustrating that this would happen after less than an entire box of staples."
1,Terrible!,"Like another person reported, I have to open it after every staple. And it jams every 10 staples or so. Works fine for awhile, but if you plan to do high volume--such as a school setting--get one without this anti-jam mechanism. It JAMS JAMS JAMS!"
3,A siren smothered,"Once again one of the most beautiful voices in musical theater wraps her mezzo around a mix of quasi-theater and pop songs. When it works--in the dual Laura Nyro songs, and the surprising, thoughtful rendition of John Mayer's My Stupid Mouth (note to singers: words matter, acting counts)--McDonald achieves a glint of the delicious friction she unfurled on her most satisfying outing, 2001's Happy Songs. But the CD buckles under repetive, uninspired arrangements, making McDonald's vocal gifts feel like useless beauty; it meanders when it should soar; it lulls when it should cut like a knife to the heart."
3,"easy to use, mediocre quality pics","Unlike some of the other reviewers I had no problem easily loading photos -- the frame never froze or had any other problems. The remote control was also easy to use and the two frames colors were easy to change. I hooked it up to my laptop using the usb cord provided and just copied files into the 64MB memory (nice feature! many frames make you leave a memory card in them). Once loaded the photos look mediocre -- the color and brightness can be adjusted and that helps a little, but don't expect them to look as good as they do on your computer screen, at least for me."
4,Not as bad as I thought,"First, after reading all reviews I decided not to buy it.But than I saw the prices of the other similar products and I decided that for a third of the price it is worth a try!And I'm happy I did that!I did have some problem on transferring the images via USB but the Support was answering with 24h...and with usefull hints until it worked.I never had problem with the image resoulution fitting the whole scree,The only think I'm not happy is that the images are not that Sharp and actually too bright compare to my laptop screen.If I would go back I would buy it again.. actually I will have to do it as my wife got that as a present...."
4,"gets a little deflated, but it is as it's advertised","a squishy ball filled with sand. you can pump it up with more air. it's got a nice rubbery feel, nice and sticky/tacky for grip. nothing to it. gets the job done."
3,Nice ball with bad texture,"This ball is a smaller cousin of the medicine ball. It's softball-sized, rather than basketball-sized. Its size and weight are great. Its texture leaves a lot to be desired. The shell is *very* smooth. If your hands sweat at all, holding the ball for medium-speed and high-speed motions is going to be dicey. As long as its use is restricted to slow motions, it's O.K. Ideally, the ball would have more of an orange-peel surface like basketballs and Valeo's medicine balls have. Having a rough surface would make this O.K. product into a great product."
4,Just for Show,This is definitely for show. The helmet is very strong plastic and has a real face mask. The inside cushions are for show. The ear pads are glued in and the head pads are hollow rubber.
5,Among Best of Richard Scarry,"We have Cars, Trucks, and Things that Go, and Busytown as well as this book. As far as reading to the kids, I prefer this one. The stories are silly and engaging on a kid's level, and the word flow layout is better than Cars, Trucks, and Things that Go, even though that book has more imaginative illustrations (all the kinds of cars!). My daughter really likes reading this one over and over, so get ready!"
5,Its Wonderful,This will not disappoint. My sons loved his books as children and now my grandchildren are enjoying his books. Very delightful and fun. I highly reccomend.
5,Richard Scarry at his best!,"This is a great storybook, filled with funny and sweet vignettes that all little kids will love. Like all of Scarry's best compilations, it sneakily teaches important life lessons of kindness, patience, and tolerance at the appropriate age level for the little ones, while providing enough slapstick adventures to keep children enthralled. A great book for reading to the kids. It will become a favorite storytime choice."
5,Another Generation Enraptured,"When shopping for books for my 3 year old grandson's visit, I remembered my son's love of Richard Scarry's books. ""Favorite Storybook Ever"" is one of the two I purchased. Myles must have requested that book be read to him five times a day!! We poured over the pictures and talked about the funny vehicles like the pickle truck and always had to hunt for Goldbug!Richard Scarry is a must for any young library.Granny Texas"
2,trap bait,Aside from being a lot on the expensive side and a lot misleading(picture indicates more than one bait per purchase). The bait works fine. Use caution when dealing with this vendor. Or try Walmart which is a lower cost option.
5,The Best Way of Combating the Japanese Beetle I've Encountered,"Used with the Tanglefoot beetle trap, these lures are highly effective at trapping the dreaded Japanese Beetles that used to decimate my landscaping and garden. The lures are good for at least a month (they do, of course, lose potency over time) and they attract just the Japanese Beetles, leaving other insects (particularly beneficial ones) alone."
4,Killer,"If you like hard techno, this title is for you. Fast and hard beats will have your head spinning and wanting more. A must for any techno fan"
5,Heartwarming/wrenching,"I laughed and cried in equal measure while watching this DVD, but was wonderfully uplifted by it. Beautifully done! Bravi."
1,Literally the worst product I have ever purchased,"After opening the package, I put the staples in and proceeded to staple two pieces of regular paper together. They did not staple. When I opened the stapler up, it fell apart. After putting it back together several times, the stapler eventually got stuck. Do not under any circumstance buy this product, it is absolute junk."
4,"Wish I could've picked my own color, but the product's great","I got fuschia, which I'm not crazy about- I really wanted a stapler in blue. But this had good reviews, and they're deserved. This was inexpensive, came w/ a bunch of staples & it works exactly as described. It's small enough to fit in the zippered pocket of my ""Office in a Bag"", which a folio that has a handle, in which a 3-ring binder is placed. This was a great addition to my OIAB, which I utilize daily to keep envelopes, paper clips, pens, thank-you notes, etc., in one place. I get to accomplish things while I'm waiting in a doctor's office, on my lunch break at work, or when I have spare time on the weekend. Very glad I invested in this, as it staples smoothly & easily. Good to keep paperwork neat while on the go."
5,Durable,"I was impressed with this stapler when I had a report of 15+ pages to turn in and the big stapler didn't manage to staple the paged together and this one did! It is portable, it staples perfectly, the staple remover comes in handy when other staplers don't do the job and the best part is that it uses standard staples! No more searching for expensive mini staples that never do the job! Love it, would recommend for any student!"
5,good quality,I put it into my pencil bag and take to school every day. it is very convenient and a very good quality.
1,Only works about 1/4 of the time,"I bought this to replace another mini stapler that had gone missing. That ones worked great, but this one only works about 1/4 of the time, if even that much. I was only trying to staple two pages together, but most of the time the staple didn't fully close and got jammed. If I'd bought it at a store I'd return it, but as it is I'm just going to throw it away because it is way too frustrating a to try to use it."
3,One fall for love,"James Bond (Marcus Dean Fuller) a man with an unfinished past takes a 200 foot fall off a local landmark. He survives; not only that but finds in the process that he has gained the power to heal people,As with all people that gain abilities he must figure out why (if there is a why) and how to handle it. Eventually he will have to go home and come to grips with whom he is and in the process wrap up some unfinished business.The pace is a bit slow and it counts on more visual than verbal description. You get the feeling that this is an independent film.Similar plots and execution can be found inResurrection (Universal Vault Series)"
1,"Premise was good; however, much improvement needed.","This film has an interesting premise; however, it is poorly executed. The ending is not satisfying as there are loose ends left hanging. Confusing scenes and seemingly arbitrary actions and reactions give a disjointed feel. I watched it on Netflix. Glad I didn't pay for it."
3,What the ...???,"I admit that I was initially intrigued as the movie began; the characters were some what interesting, the music was decent, but at the half way point I began to wonder, is this movie going somewhere? Where is it going? I have to give credit to the leading man, he wrote both the story and screenplay, as well as directed and starred. Ultimately though the movie, in my opinion, didn't arrive anywhere. What was the ""choice"" that the ""hero"" was supposed to make? The end was quite nebulous, which ruined, for me, any sense of connection with the film up to that point. Maybe someone could explain it to me?"
1,All Plastic & Craptastic,"This safe is a heavy plastic hunk of junk. The latch is thin plastic and could be smashed open easily with a hammer. It is not fully fireproof (if set on its side as the literature states), and is only water proof up to 1 hour submerged and the literature also recommends that you put items in separate waterproof bag inside. Um, what is the point? It is not secure against theft, fire or flood, I cannot detect any metal on this thing (other than the keys & lock), it is ALL PLASTIC. In a fire this thing might even melt/entomb items inside! Save your money. I will be returning mine. -AND after hearing all those reviews about the brown mold issue, that is the final nail in this coffin. Yikes. It looks like First Alert needs to go back to the drawing board on this one, and/or have a product recall."
1,Horrible -- everything wet and moldy,I bought this safe in Feb 2009 and placed all my important documents in this safe -- I opened it today to see brown mold on everything and everything is wet. It is past the return time to Amazon for this safe -- which is not fair -- since I didn't know everything would be moldy after a few months. Do not buy this safe!
1,AVOID purchasing - MOLDY DOCUMENTS,"After storing our passports, birth certificates and other important papers in this product for a while, upon opening, I have found our documents covered with mold. The instructions did not mention the need for airing it out periodically.We purchased this item to keep our documents safe, yet it ended up damaging them. All of them are moldy and smelly. I would give this zero stars if that would be an option."
3,Good Quality Not sized appropriately on the inside,"Good quality safe; however, it was documented that it would hold 8 1/2"" x 11"" legal papers. You have to stuff them in and crickle the sides to make it work. Otherwise, it meets my needs."
4,mostly ok,I bought this for my sonHe said it was pretty good -legal size papers could fit in well but folders were a bit tight and could not lay down flat so he was a little disappointed. But mostly -ok.
4,OK for the money,"These are OK for what they cost. As decoration only, they're excellent. For training, the handle tape comes loose a bit too easily, so I may end up replacing it with hockey stick tape. Also, the shiny paint chips off a little bit every time you click them together."
4,"Great movie, but a tad long","Very interesting. When I saw the movie I ""realized"" that all of the middle aged/older politicians, priests, businessmen, etc in West Germany in the 1960s and 1970s had been Nazis 15-20 years earlier.Great movie, but it's a little long."
2,"uhh, wait hold on... it's not that great...","there's about three good songs on the album. that's it. the rest just doesn't do it. at least not like Endtroducing by DJ Shadow did.HIGHLY overrated. good formula but bad sound. this is a good example of the ""great white hope"" thing going on in rap today."
5,"great product, but too expensive","These are great staples if you have a compatible Swingline Optima high-capacity stapler. However, the price here is ridiculous. The MSRP for these is $6.29 and big box office supply stores sell it for less than $5."
1,Batteries suck....lights stay on for a hour,"1/2 of the lights stay on a hour or so, cool lights, nice design but either the batteries or the recharging system sucks, I live in Sunny Southern Califoirnia, lights are not in shade and we have had sunny weather for two weeks, and the lights do not stay on, but 8-9 PM 1/2 are out, 1/2 work fine?? I do not want to send the whole batch back but ?? what the heck they do not work..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought these lights and the first night they were beautiful and bright with a big halo of light around each of them. I thought I had really chosen a perfect solar light. However, these lights stay on less than two hours and they have had plenty of sun to charge the batteries. I guess my next step will be to replace the batteries and see if that helps. My recommendation would be to try another brand."
2,solar lights need alot of help,lights look great but don't work great 8 out of the 12 lights work and they last pretty much a long time 4 of the lights did'nt last at all they lasted minutes and they shut off and they don't work at all but they look good.for the money 67 percent of lights is ok
2,Good Concept - but they dont' work!,"When I first got the lights, on a sunny day, they charged right up and worked fine that night. However the plastic rod used to mount them in the ground is very unstable and will break easily.The worst part is that if there is moisture on the top of lamps, or if it a cloudy day, they don['t come on at all at night.maybe a couple will, but thats about it.Its really a shame as the lights look good for the price and we were really happy the first night.since then, a few of them might turn on once in a while, but not all of them.I bought these because I didnt' feel like running electrical wire under the pathway to our house, but it looks like thats what I am going to have to do.Bummer...."
1,loose and useless,"These staples arrived on time - we had them shipped overnight as job was urgent and it is an hour drive to get supplies. They were in a box , next to the box they should have been in, loose. As they were for a staple gun this makes them useless, so I am out 27 bucks as the return will not come up online. Very disgusted and no on to contact. grrrrrrr"
1,Not well designed or made,Too much space between upper element and tray. No insulation - outside gets too hot to touch. Returned.
4,A good western!,"I found this book to be quite good. The story was good, with a lot of color to it. Nice characters and small plot twists that made it really interesting.Perhaps the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I couldn't relate entirely with the main characters. The hero was a little selfish for my taste and the heroine's insecurities were not really believable. But I could believe their passion and liked their love story in the end."
2,"REALLY, REALLY BAD","I am always looking for a good western romance and bought this based upon the reviews. After having finished it, I wondered if I read the same book as the other reviewers. This book was awful. The heroine is the typical virginal saint seen in the older romance novels - she is nice to all sorts of downtrodden invididuals and animals. The hero is the cliched man with a tortured past. The book is so poorly written that the very premise (man marries unsuitable woman to thumb his nose at his family)is not believable. Read The Light In The Darkness by Ellen Fisher for a similar premise and a well written novel."
5,Very Good Book,"This was a very good book, easy read and kept my attention. Believable even though it was set in long ago days. I felt like I was part of the book, the details were so vivid and I couldn't wait to see what happened next!"
4,A Western tale of redemption,"A Western tale of redemption and discovery. Themes of family and community accentuate this marriage of convenience story. With every twist and turn, the past and present collide exposing Drake and Pearl's fears. Poor or rich, married or single, this book illustrates the human quest for acceptance and love."
3,C for cranky,"I had purchased this bed. Not necessary from Amazon but I had owned this same bed. I will only say a few Pros/ConsCons:Black metal is easily to be scratched. Has stickers on top bunk bed.Not made to re-assemble (several times)Pros:Bed has metal supports to allow the mattress to stay in place, same for the top bunk.Permanent side laddersI will ONLY recommend this for light young children."
3,italian genealogy,this book is a good reference but being british and searching from that point of view i found it disappointing as it was mainly for american reasearchers.
4,Will work for storing Kids Artwork,"I ordered these when they were a goldbox deal because I have a kindergartener who LOVES to do art. This product will definitely help me keep a bit of it safe and stored away once it comes down from the frig. Quality is ok and I like that you can add their picture to the front. It wont fit projects that are large in depth, but will hold many size paper projects nicely."
5,a place for large artwork keepsakes,"I have one of these for each of my 4 kids. They have dividers that i have labeled pre-K through 6th grade. It has given us a place for all of the beautiful, but large, artwork that they bring home in the early years of school."
3,Good place to store recent artwork,I purchased this for my son (who LOVES to draw) so that we'd have a place to store his pictures after they did their time on the fridge. I love the size of it - can store those pieces that are on unusually shaped paper or even long pieces of paper. I just wish it actually snapped closed or something - the top is open like an expanding file. To actually save his pictures for the long-term I'm going to have to invest in something else so they don't yellow/fade.
1,a classic reissued at least the third time around?,"Question: This must be at least the third time the oiginal SD albums have been imposed upon the buying public.Released once in the eighties;released in a lavish(and flawed)box set in the ninetees.Why,nearly twenty years into the CD revolution, are the artists only now taking a hands-on approach in the remastering of the individual discs? Considering Becker and Fagen's legendary anal retentiveness this doesn't make sense. Answer: is twofold. Money and Cynicism. The two motivating forces driving all the major labels. Are long-time fans supposed to keep shelling out while continually being led to believe that each new series of reissues is the best and truest? I, for one, am tired of reissues of reissues of reissues of reissues.Caveat Emptor!"
2,not his greatest hits,I went to a concert put on by his son's. I know the songs. This alblum is not his 25 greatest hits. I do not know how they can claim that it is. Be careful before you by this CD. It might be OK if you were a real hard core fan.
3,"Good music, bad sound","This is a great moe. show. The playing is awesome and the jams are incredible. However, for some reason they decided to use a matrix sbd/mic mix and it suffers in places, mostly with the vocals. This is unfortunate because this is such a quality show. They should have stuck to a mix that works better like their last commercial live release. Leave this kind of stuff for the tapers. We can all get semi-good recordings of their shows already and we want the best when they release it themselves."
3,Where is the signature Kenny G Sound?,"This Faith CD is disappointing. The sound of this CD is VERY mainstream, VERY average. The songs are nice, but they did not have the signature Kenny G sound. They sounded like anyone, not Kenny G. The Millenium mix is unexpected, and unwanted. I have Kenny G's Miracles CD, and love it. I was hoping for more of the same--Kenny G's unique style--with this new CD, but it didn't happen."
4,Almost Great,"Everything about this Cd speaks to the greatness of Kenny G CDs; everything except the last song that mixes voices from the past with Auld Lang Syne...bad idea. However for all the rest of the CD, great selections with superb delivery make it a must have!"
4,A must-have,"Like many of the customers on this board, I first heard the Millennium Mix while in the car and was oddly moved to tears ! What a beautiful and fitting look back at the last century. The broadcasts were chosen with a lot of care, and were for the most part in chronological order. I was never previously a fan of Kenny G's, but bought this album only for that one cut, but that alone is worth it, it was very transitional, and the sound bites over-lapping the music made it all the more poignant. A sure-fire collector's piece !"
5,Awesome,This album is one of the best Jazz Christmas CDs. I listen to it on the train on my way to work and as often as I can. Absolutely LOVE It!!!
4,LOVE IT!,I love this CD. Why? It speaks to the heart. It has been a long time since I've heard music that moves me to tears. Ave Maria is hauntingly beautiful... Millennium Mix...WOW! Pretty powerful stuff....
5,The Most Emotional Xmas CD I Ever Heard,This is a wonderful CD! There are a variety of songs to please most people. Most the songs made me want to dance the way Kenny G played them. His version of Ave Maria is beautiful. The millinium Auld Lang Syne had me crying. . . . Was worth purchasing for the millinium memories.
5,Good Welcome-Home Accent,"I purchased this candle for my wife. She loves the scent. It is very refreshing, and is capable of refreshing the entire house in just 20 minutes or so. With short burn times like that, and properly trimmed wicks, this candle has lasted longer than we expected."
5,just wonderful,Dexter is a wonderful series that keeps you gripped and watching until the very end. No disappointments this season for sure
2,Yuck!,If you want to watch something satisfying and pleasant before bed... this is NOT the show to watch. I don't know how a premise that is so disgusting can be entertaining to ANYONE. This is about a serial killer who kills serial killers = P.
1,Not for the queasy,"This was simply too gross, blood-and-guts for me. I got through the first 5 minutes and realized - it's over-the-top grossness just couldn't hold my interest."
5,Love it,"I read the book and liked it quite a bit - but I like the series even more. Quite a few changes in both characters and plot line. I ended up liking both, I think better than the book. Can't wait now to order season two. It was out of stock the other day when I checked. My brother and sister liked it too - we get together for ""pizza night"" every once in awhile and we kept watching - ""just one more"" episode."
5,Dexter's 1st Season,"GREAT!!!!! That is all I can say. I could hardly wait to get to the next episode to see the plot twists. The cast of characters & their relationships are spot on & Michael C Hall is an incredible actor who MAKES the show. I never dreamed I could be in love with a serial killer, but I am. I can't wait for the 2nd Season to be released."
5,Great purchase,"Dexter is amazingly intriguing. I went through the entire season in 3 sittings and was captivated by every episode. In this season, there are many flashbacks that reveal Dexter's childhood and how he managed to hide his dark character beneath a veneer of civility. I highly recommend this series for anyone who likes crime and silence of the lambs."
4,Gotta love Dexter,"How a serial killer has managed to capture my attention still mystifies me, I started watching because I was intrigued as to how they were going to turn those rather dark books into a tv series for prime time. But they have succeeded beautifully.The opening sequence is sheer visual artistry at its best."
2,What's Wrong With Me???,"I bought the DVD set of the 1st Season of this show due primarily to the glowing comments of Amazon reviewers. I watched the first two episodes of last night and must confess to being a bit bewildered. What is so entertaining about a sociopath mass murderer who brutally tortures his victims as he decapitates them alive or chops off their limbs? What on earth is entertaining about a protagonist who nearly has an orgasm over the idea of another serial killer who is even more clever and sadistic than he? I really tried to give this series a chance, but I found it mind-numbingly sick!! I can't find much of socially redeeming value in this work. it really doesn't matter to me if the victims of Dexter are bad guys - his way of killing them is so barbaric that I find my sympathies leaning solidly toward his victims. But, of course, the problem could just be with me - maybe I have too soft a stomach."
2,broken disc 2,"love the series, however, the second disk was broken. have not contacted amazon concerning this, since there is no returns on dvd's. help... amazon, want to send me disc 2?"
1,Dexter the first season Blu-ray,"The family had gathered round, we were all set for a sparkling night's entertaiment. I turned off the lights and pressedthe ""Play"" button. Nothing. Nothing!! Then a message to the effect that the disc wouldnot play in my region. Nothing on the Amazon site oron the blueray disc or packaging to indicate there might be a problem. I have bought many DVDs and a few bluerays. AmaZon are well aware that I live in New Zealand. In New Zealand law it is the retailersresponsibility to ensure that the goods they sellare fit for their intended purpose.Amazon won't let me award the zero stars I would like to give."
4,An exciting and interesting perspective,I first got hooked watching it online from a company that rents movies through the mail that also allows you to watch instantly through the interwebs. I got hooked and loved the series. The first season is great (IMO better than the second). He appears more normal in the 2nd season and strayed away from his quirks.
4,Dexter Delivers,"This is a great series, made all the better by Michael C. Hall as the eponymous anti-hero. Without him, the series might have floundered; a lesser actor may not have walked the delicate tightrope between murderous and magnanimous with the same masterful balance. The series is well written, with a very cleverly conceived title sequence, but it truly is the reliable performances which make this show. Highly recommended (especially for those who love themselves a bit of Michael C. Hall)."
2,dexter,"I never actually got to watch it. It arrived in a timely manner, but disks 1 & 2 don't work. :("
4,Ultimate Outsider,"What I like most about this show is Dexter's efforts at (& confusion over) emotion. Since he has none of his own, he is always observing and sometimes wondering why people do the things they do. I feel like I can relate to that as I sometime wonder at the behavior of my fellow humans. To be honest, I find that more intreresting than his weekly pursuit of justice."
4,I had doubts however was pleasantly suprised,"I must admit that I had doubts when my ex-husband said I should purchase this series...I did and at first I had doubts but I became a fan and I'm now watching season 2. the caracters all have their quirks and intermingle well with each other, well written, well directed, BRAVO!!"
5,Best series on TV,"Well written, good actors (about everyone ever on OZ or 6ft Under it seems)and it's not the predictable swill most networks are pumping out. REALLY good, just wish it had Spanish subtitles."
5,Dexter - Season 1,"Dexter is a fabulous show, witty, dark, will keep you on the edge of your seat! I can't get enough of Dexter!!!!!"
5,One of the greatest television shows ever.,"I saw the previews for Dexter and went out and bought the first season on dvd. It was well worth the thirty dollars. The show is brilliant. The acting and dialogue hit on all levels. The show manages to be part horror, crime drama, and comedy all in one. Dexter is the most likeable serial killer I have ever seen, even more so than Hannibal Lecter in Silance of the Lambs. Dexter is a nice polite guy who just happens to enjoy dispensing justice. He does very bad things to very bad people. It makes it easy to sympathize with him. The show doesn't drown us in senseless gore. All the gore in the show has a point. The interactions with his sister and girlfriend are very funny, but it is often the interactions with his victims that are truly hilarious. My personal favorites are the coyote couple he gets relationship advice from and a murderous psychiatrist that also gives him a little help. Buy this show and hope that they keep making more and more episodes."
4,"Rooting for a serial killer, really?","A little creepy a first, but that's because this series pushes and blurs the lines that supposedly define right & wrong. Our family got hooked!"
5,Love it Love it Love it,"Sounds bad to root for a serial killer, but you can't help but love Dexter and his sense of right and wrong."
5,Only series I have ever bought,"I am not into series and will not buy series, but I bought this one. The only other series I have ever boughten is Band of Brothers and that was really a mini-series.This is good stuff. It is intelligent, sarcastic, sexy, vulnerable, justifiable and you laugh at the narrative and some of the dry humor that goes on. There are very contrasting characters set up. A good guy serial killer series basically in a nutshell.I watched the second series too and enjoyed that enough to buy the 3rd season.For me, I rent other movies on the weekend and when I was watching the 2nd season, I would not take the time to watch my rented movies because I wanted to watch Dexter instead. It will suck when I run out of episodes to watch.Highly recommended."
5,New Dexter fan,"I just happened onto Dexter since it follows Homeland and have since become a great fan of the show. The theme is so bizarre, the acting is great, and the plot twists are very entertaining. And still there is a lot of humor in the show. I now have the pleasure of watching it starting with season one. I'm in luck!"
5,GREAT,"I love, love, love this show! I bought this episode for my husband who likes the show. I started watching it with him, and now I am addicted! The story line is great. It is like a twisted-psychotic Grey's anatomy!"
1,Very Disappointed,I ordered all 6 seasons of Dexter for my son for Christmas he knew I got them for him and begged me to let him have season 1 so I gave in to shut him up and when we were watching it the clarity and quality was horrible it was a BOOTLEG I was so angry and basicaly felt ripped off just waiting to hear back to see if they will make good on my purchase if so I will come back and write a good review on how they took care of me.SignedNot a happy customer
2,"D-Core Pillow, Full Size","I have neck and shoulder problems and wake up with headaches so I was looking for a better pillow than the memory foam pillow I had been using. Though the D-Core seemed like a good purchase, within a week I decided that this pillow is just too large for me (I'm under 5'). I could not sleep on my side with this pillow and when I slept on my back, the sides of the pillow engulfed my face. Perhaps a much smaller core pillow would have helped but in the meantime, I have purchased and fallen love with a buckwheat pillow made by bean72 purchased through Amazon."
2,Not what it appears to be!!,"This is a weighed fitness ball, but very deceptive by what you see. The ball is small - about the size of a cantalope - and full of sand for the weight. It is slippery rubber on the outside so you can't use it for certain exercises because it can slip out of your hand. We were very unhappy with the product."
3,the batman info,this dvd is a begin of the batman saga and it mildly touch the base of the series it introduce you to the early charaters and not much else. If you have a dvd collection it is worthy of a look.
3,Pretty good,"Not too bad, but definetly not like their first, awesome debut CD. They have slowed things down quite a bit and I felt as though I was being sung asleep by love songs. Not too bad, but not too good either."
5,Another Jars Of Clay Success!,"I received this new album for Christmas. I have the two other Jars Of Clay albums as well. The first album is my favorite... the second was Okay. This third one is terrific! Definitely as good as the first, I think. I highly recommend this one to both fans and newcomers to their music! I can't stop playing it. ALL the songs are good. Order this one now... you won't be disappointed!"
5,hey?,oK so i haven't listened to it... but the demos sounded good... does anyone know when this CD is coming to Australia? If you do or you know when JOC are next planning to head down under can you PLEASE let me know
5,This is powerful music with and heartfelt message.,"I have been a fan of Jars of Clay ever since their first CD came out. I like the acoustic style, and raw reality portrayed. I think this newest CD, If I left the Zoo, is one of the most innovative. They've incorporated so much diversity into their traditional style, with unusual parts that don't overpower the message. Some people think that the vocals are weak, but they really speak to me. I like how Haseltine's voice is so raw and true. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes diverse music."
3,Not What I Expected,"Before I owned this album, I owned WoW 2001. On it was one of their songs, Unforgetful You. I just loved that song and, decided to but their album. When I popped my new CD in my CD player I was disapointed by the huge difference in their Unforgetful You and their title track. Goodbye, Goodnight was a lot softer mooded than what I expected. The only other song I like is Collide. If you like christian pop, buy it. But, don't buy it if you like chritian rock."
5,Wow.... Great CD.....,"Eventhough I have been a huge fan of Jars of Clay since their first self-titled album, ""Jars of Clay"" in 1995, I was reluctant to pop their new CD, If I left the Zoo into my player when it first came out. I was thinking to myself,""How can they ever top their first CD which went double platinum in about one year? "" Well, the guys went above and beyond my expectations. Needless to say, I have really haven't even taken their new CD out of the stereo in my room and I bought a copy for almost each one of my friends to enjoy! Then to top it all off, I got to see their AWSOME tour show when they came to Phoenix, AZ on 3/15. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this CD to anyone and everyone. (even if you aren't a JofC fan now, you will be when you buy their new CD, If I Left the ZOO!) :)"
2,NOT HAPPY,"When you look at the initial description to this product, you would think that it is volumes 1-8 in their entirity..not missing volume 2. I did not read the fine print and got burned on this purchase. Honestly volume 2 was the only volume I wanted because it is the volume that my grandmother use to read to me on the farm and I am having the hardest time finding it. I wanted the full collection for when I have children so they could have fond memories of me reading to them. VERY DISAPPOINTED by this sellers description."
2,Like the first Tranceport - DON'T get this one,"There are two subgenres of trance that have emerged over the last decade. The first is what I would consider anthem or drama trance - big blow-ups, lots of dynamics, uplifting and energetic. The second is the resurgence of highly repetitive, mind-numbing trance.While Oakenfold took us through exstatic anthems in Tranceport 1, Ralph goes for the loop-laden modern trance experience in this album. I must admit that I'm no fan of this style of trance and I regret purchasing it when it first came out just because it had the ""Tranceport"" name on it. Long, loop-heavy songs (or in this case an entire album) are great for clubbing, but they are annoying to listen to while sober and at home (or in my case at work ;-P ).This album is definitely geared toward the deep trance fan, and not the trance anthem fan. If you're looking for anthem, check out Trance: ASC and Trance II - they're much closer to Oaky's Tranceport. -tN"
4,Great follow-up to the classic first version.,This 2 CD set is a great second effort from the allmighty Tranceport vol. 1. It includes some of today's best trance music mixed to perfection.
2,Completely separate style when compared to Tranceport 1...,Tranceport is probably the best CD I own; it's a trance CD that can get me to feel amazing emotions I normally wouldn't be able to even fathom...Dave Ralph has a few catchy-ish sounds here and there...but it definitely doesn't invoke the same emotion as Oakenfold's CD did. For most of the tranceheads out there...I'd suggest Tranceport 1 and 3 only...2 is alright...but it doesn't envoke real emotion.
2,minimalist techno,"I heard this album on a listening bay in a local record shop and was impressed not only with how it sounded, but that it was one of the few albums which actually showed someone layering tracks up to four deep (usually three at a time).Sometime later when I bought it, it seemed like maybe I'd heard another album. This is basically 60 minutes of beats. To me, this makes the mixing less impressive, as its fairly easy to mix rhythms. It really needs someone to put something on top of it.Having said that it really is done extremely well. But if you hate drum solos, this is not the album for you."
2,Pool Pump,Pump works great. Original pump only lasted one season. Saved money ordering here compared to OEM. Arrived quickly. I ordered replacement filters through OEM and could have saved money ordering here. I won't make that mistake again.
4,Awesome supplimentary book.,I purchased this book when I was taking 100 level Japanese in college and it really helped me a lot with understanding the different particles. Particles are part of the backbone of Japanese language so you have to know them and this book really helps you do that. I recommend this book to anyone trying to learn Japanese.
5,Perfect for kids,"This book was surprisingly very good, very on target with what children find interesting. The coolest parts to Benjamin were the brief, simple explanations of cats' behavior (""If a cat rolls onto its back, then it feels safe with you."" etc.) The pictures are all fantastic, the language is just right for young ones and beginning readers, the whole book is just extraordinarily well made. And, a beautiful hard back that only cost me $4.99. I will be ordering more."
3,Wait for it.,"While the episodes on this DVD are definitely worth watching, I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you were a collector. I just think that it's a bit of a ripoff on WB's part for not putting the widescreen version on the DVD. Not only that, but Cartoon Network is currently showing reruns of Justice League Unlimited. If you really want to see these episodes, I would suggest waiting for them to rerun on CN. And if you can't wait for the reruns, the local video store is always a good place to visit! :)"
3,Very cool for michael jordan lovers only,"When the phone rings, the basketball opens up, and you see a staduim with fans. The music starts and the announcer annouces michael jordan.Its pretty cool the first few times, then its gets annoying to hear the music everytime the phone rings.There is a button that you can press to start the show intsead of having it work with the telephone.In the model we got, the picture shows the scoreboard lighting up, but we can't get it to work."
2,Potato Potato Potato Tomato,"There should be a warning on #58-72 (adults only). Also, not too fond of #83, Potato can substitute for ping pong ball in a game of chess."
1,Above Ground Pool - Eye PE-13,"This product's remote is not capable to receiving signals into the house, making it a very unreliable alarm. It is priced at $119.00 plus, and is not worth the money. Contacting this company's customer service via email is a waste of time."
2,Random rant,Isn't odd how people only find a product review useful if the reviewers opinion correlates with that of the person reading it?Whether or not the reviewer has argued his case solidly or articulated with above average depth his feelings on the matter means apparently very litte to the great non-book reading American public.Mark E. Smith
4,ok product for accord,look good but doesn't fit well on my coupeoverall good product but need some work to make it fit 98-2002 Accord better!
4,Good book,The only book I have seen that categorizes scotch by taste. I will buy one for my brother-in-law who is also a Scotch drinker.
5,Great stapler,I use them in the Swingline #270 which is an awesome stapler. The staples lay flat on the back. I have gone through 3 of these clips without any problems.
3,Not Really a book about Lillie,"This is not really a 'diary' of lillie Langtry. Lillie's life (and her real-life acting tours across the USA) is used as a literary conceit to put together a series of biographies of contempoaray 'famous' american women.A lot of these women had quite significant achievements in their lifetime, but I had never heard of them before.While I found their lives interesting I was dissapointed to see how little the author developed Lillie's Life story. Beware of the 'other rememberances' in this book's title, because they, not lillie, take up the bulk of the book.Buy this if you are interested in a series of biographies on dis-seperate, but ground breaking women - don't buy it if you want an interesting book on Lillie Langtry, because in the end it's not really about her, despite the title."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this T-square and the one I got did not have a perfect right angle. The T-top is made out of wood as is the straight edge piece. These two pieces of wood are held together by 5 small screws. The low grade wood used in making this t-square will have a tendency to warp. The screws in the one I purchased weren't all uniform to begin with so that leads me to think that either the machines used to make them are imperfect or the workmanship is lacking. (By the way, I bought mine at Staples and ALL of the T-squares had the same issues with the screws.)If you're just look to make a straight line fairly perpendicular to an edge, then it's okay for that. If you're looking for something with a perfect right angle, I recommend staying away from this item."
4,Excellent French Playwright,"I was first introduced to Jean Anouilh during a script analysis class, where I was required to do a scene design. My professor recommended Jean Anouilh's ""Antigone"" to me and I took his advice. Much to my surprise, ""Antigone,"" set in France after the Nazi invasion, quickly became my favorite play ever. ""Romeo and Jeanette"" takes place in a poor family's house in France and is highly amusing. Set in the middle of a French train station with a defunct acting troupe and the poor family who runs the cafe there, ""Eurydice"" is quite entertaining. Anouilh definately puts a different spin on the typical love story. I highly recommend this book to anybody who's looking for something different to read, or maybe looking for a spin on the classics."
2,Nice saw that doesn't work,"I purchased the trim saw last Sept, 03 from Amazon.com. I used it several times and was pleased with it's performance.Tried to use it again today (May 2, 04) and it would not run. (May be a switch problem) This saw has been in production for a long time and the manufacturing problems should have been solved by now.If I was to buy a trim saw again, I would buy a small battery operated saw (the 18 volt Dewalt is nice). I used my sons dewalt and was impressed that the distance from the blade to the edge of the base plate was a standard 1 inch on one side and 4 inches on the other so it was easy to clamp a staight edge to the line of cut. It had plenty of power and could cut thru thicker stock than the Porter-Cable saw."
4,Is she or isn't she?,"This is an excellent portrayal of a young girl's coming-of-age. All aspects of her character are dealt with: psychological, physical, and social. Beth's relationship with Nora, and the end of the story, beg the question ""is she a lesbian or isn't she?"" This reviewer takes exception to the ALA's review (first on this page), which states that Nora is emotionally disturbed. Is this yet another way for the ""het"" world to imply that being gay is tantamount to being emotionally disturbed? The reviewer should have qualified her use of the phrase ""emotionally disturbed."" An excellent book, highly recommended to all. We look forward to more work by this Canadian author. Part of the book's excellence lies in the fact that the reader continues thinking and wondering about the ending, long after the cover has been closed."
4,Dreamy imagery,"Although an unsatisfying ending, this book has beautiful dreamy imagery. It takes the reader on a journey into Beth's mind. She is an extraordinary character, a true butterfly with a broken wing"
3,The suggestion that not all black men on screen are as lily-white - or should it be black? - is excellently demonstrated...,"The story is that of two con-men: White Folks (Kiel Martin), who had a black mother and a white father and whose skin is white; and Blue Howard ( Mel Stewart), a grizzled black veteran who has taught his young protégé everything he knows about the art of dishonest tricks...Together they cheat the Mafia and the police; they make $10,000 and have to give some of it away to the local black protection retailer; they set up a confidence property deal to get by fraud some over-greedy white businessmen out of $150,000, but cannot quite shield the stolen loot...The distinguished trait of the film is that not all the blacks are all good, and not all the whites are all bad... What is more, it makes a point of showing that black men can play on their color to win their own ends..."
3,A disappointment for X-Philes...,"Well, I must confess that I bought this only because of the XF track - and it simply isn't worth it. The 30min track is basically a compact ""The Truth and the Light"" without spoken words. The only new tune is the ending from ""Jose Chung's..."", everything else is season 1 and 2... With such great music on seasons 4, 5 and 6 (just think the teaser from ""The Beginning""), and a crowd like us begging for music from those seasons, I just don't see why they keep marketing OLD stuff."
3,Arghhhhhh....,"Don't get me wrong, a lot of the music on this CD is great. But the main reason I bought this CD was because I was on a flight to London when I heard an absolutely haunting rendition of The X-Files theme on the in-flight music selection. I checked out the in-flight magazine, and it said that they were using tracks from The Snow Files. So I ordered the CD and--to my horror--discovered that the absolutely haunting rendition of the theme is not on the CD. I'm going to write letters to Sonic Images and try and find out where I can find that piece instead. But if you were on a United flight to London recently, and you're looking for that X-Files theme, you won't find it on this CD., and one of the music channels on the flight was playing a couple of tracks of Mark Snow"
5,Great Kit,The delivery time was alright.The applicator itself works really nice. So for the price not bad at all and you get free labels and also a design software.
4,Springy but short,"These are cute, handy LITTLE tongs. The round-ended one is 7"" long and the other is 6"" long. I really needed larger tongs (9"" as described) but these will have their uses."
1,"Unbreakable, but easily bent. Don't waste your money.","RPM claims to have the best policy regarding their products because they are guaranteed not to break. I have purchased several different RPM parts for my RC truck and they bend very easily. I have contacted RPM several times regarding their products. At first they were happy to give me all kinds of advice on boiling and re-bending their parts into shape. That is foolish as we all know that a stressed plastic will not magically mend itself when heated. I tried their suggestions and the results were as expected... a waste of time. NOTE!: RPM will NOT replace a BENT part that is no longer functioning. So save yourself a ton of money and buy stock parts that are much cheaper. The stock parts will also bend and when they do, they are easier on the wallet to replace."
5,Anime at its best!,"This is anime at its absolute best!It is about the adventures of interplanetary bounty hunters, called ""cowboys"", and their spaceship called ""Bebop"".No punches are pulled in this gritty series, it is meant for teenagers or adults and rightfully so.I recommend it."
1,"I bet the poster is fine, but the company is terrible.",I ordered this item and more than a month and several emails with the company later I still have not received it. I wouldn't order anything from posterpalooza unless you have money to throw down the toilet.They get one star because it is not possible to give zero.
4,You will definitely be blessed and assured of God's love!,"As an avid Bible reader, I really enjoyed this fiction anthology, which put a contemporary twist on Bible stories. Each of the contributing authors are great writers individually, by bringing their talents together they have written a book that provides hope, encouragement and inspiration as well a good entertaining read. Blessed Assurance is a fast- paced book that you will turn to repeatedly for modern day stories of historical characters and never tire. I highly recommend it.**** Reviewed by Sandra for www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com The GOOD GIRL Book Club"
4,un buen disco de una leyenda,"el disco se pasea por algunos temas clásicos del rock latino y algunas piezas nuevas, siempre con la excelente e inacabable voz de Miguel Ríos, toda una leyenda de la música en castellanoalgunas versiones incluso superan las versiones de los artistas originales. En especial, puede destacarse la versión de insurrección, junto a manolo garcía ex el último de la fila, que actualiza este tema de los primeros discos de EUDLF en los 80,s.igualmente las versiones junto a Sabina, fito, charly y los aterciopelados son especialmente destacables."
2,No Black Bows!,"I wanted exactly what I was looking at & exactly what was described. White thigh high pantyhose with black bows DID NOT arrive at my house twice. I was a day away from needing to wear them so I had to take off the white bows & dye them myself, then re sew them back on. Which I'm not great at & feared I'd be missing a bow about an hour into my beer drinking festivities, so I safety pinned them back on. I know, I'm rambling, but I like getting what I want & what I see. If I wanted white bows, I would've looked for them..."
3,meh,"I received this product just a few moments ago and I tried them on immediately. I'm 5'5 and a half, 172lbs., mostly thighs, and they went up to where they were supposed to be, the problem is that they don't stay there! They kept sorta rolling back down to my knees, but maybe its just the thickness of my legs, I dunno.But all in all, for the price they're not a bad pair of tights.I plan on keeping them but I won't be buying from this company in the future."
1,disappointed!,I was very much looking forward to attaining this product because I am a big fan of Chuck Connors but I was very disappointed due to the poor condition of the slip-case and as a collector who enjoys having his belongings in the best condition possible I chose to return this item.Amazon.com has to excercise better quality control in the area of packaging the items that they ship!
3,Mrs.Peterkova's clarinet is nice,"She plays clarinet in ""Maurice Ravel:Introduction et Allegro"". I like her clarinet sound very much, because it is too soft and brilliant."
4,Hard to find in office supply stores but here it is.,"I have a really good stapler bostich but happen that the staples for this unit have been discontinued from most office supply stores. I decided to buy online, and I don't regret it. It is fantastic product. I recommended it. If you have this format of staples, it is worth to try."
1,Doesn't work with my stapler,"They may work great with Bostitch staplers, but not with my stand up one. It uses 1/4"" staples, which is what these are, but they don't sit in the stapler properly, which makes it impossible for the metal bar (which is attached to the spring) to push the staples forward. Every time I wanted to staple, I had to open up the stapler, push the staples forward, and then attempt to staple. I say attempt because it didn't always work (failed 3 out of 4 times), jammed and the staples broke apart, which was annoying. I wouldn't have persisted except I had to staple 15 sets of papers. I tossed the rest in the trash and just ordered standard staples."
1,Staples,The product was the wrong item and doesnot work in the stapler for which I order the staples. The search for the correct item pointed me to an incorrect item.
4,Excellent,"The book deals with the scum of the earth. It shows their courage and ""honesty"" in the face of the hypocricy in the world. The book is a murder mystery of sorts, set in the ghettos of Cairo, Eygpt in the 50's or so. The insights the author brings to the lives of the lowest of the low is not matched by many other authors in any language."
2,"Loose latch/knob, not very good quality","The safe came brand-new in box, but the moment I took it out, the knob was noticeably loose. I ended up having to open it up to fix the know, but it seems something was missing with the knob assembly. Also, the instruction said you have to use ""B"" after the secret code to unlock, but ""A"" will also work. The keyed lock is not very sophisticated. This safe is only good for putting away small items, but is by no mean safe."
4,good,i like this safe came with batteries i use the code keys pretty cool they have a code on them and the key hole is hidden witch i find really cool
4,good product but no proper instuction,"product seems ok ,however no installation kid or instruction. seller is also do not disclose their phone #.very down size."
1,Waiting for things to make sense,"This anime seems to be very highly recommended by nearly everyone. I am sorry to say that I have a very different opinion of this show. Granted it is not your typical boy-pilots-giant-mecha, as this show focuses on character development instead of action. One may think that a high level of character development would be a good thing, but it is very tedious here. First and foremost, I did not like any of the characters in this show. Experience with other anime programs has led me to identify with characters like Spike (Cowboy B) and Vash (Trigun). Don't expect any prototype heros in Evangelion because there are none. It is like a bad episode of Jerry Springer.I do not doubt that this anime will be very satisfying for a large audience of anime fans, but I would like to warn anyone who is expecting this to be another gundam show. I liked Cowboy Bebop, I liked Trigun, I liked Outlaw Star, I liked Lodoss War, I absolutely hated Evangelion."
2,DVD version is bellow standard,I am an avid fan of Evangelion and was eagerly awaiting the DVD release of the series. Unfortunatly whoever was in charge of this disc at ADV films simply butchered it. The video quality is way bellow DVD standards. There are lots of convertion artifacts and the worse problem since to be a convergence issue which gives the video a dated look (similar to looking at a really old color TV set)IMHO VHS actually look better than this. Evangelion is my favorite anime series but this DVD simply made me sick. My only hope is that ADV films will correct the problem in future releases.
3,Good until the last 2 WTF episodes,"Well unless I want to spoil the ending for everyone who hasnt seen the show, its not bad until you get to the last 2 episodes.I am just glad they had commentary on the last disk that explained the final episodes to me. It reminds me a hell of a lot of another British series from the '60s (which is also mentioned in the commentary) in which you had to log onto the internet to find out what the hell did all that just mean ????.At least the show was a hell of a lot better than my last foray into anime, the terrribly lame Chobits ...."
3,Good images but not much more than that,"I saw the first 10 episodes of NG Evangelion. The first 2 or 3 are very good, with a good story and a good plot, but then... it happens. Stupid capricius characters are mixed with the good ones . Shinji is a serious well done character, but the other pilots like the red haired girl -don't remember the name, my unconcius doesn't allow me to- sucks! The silent girl -don't remember the name too- is a good one to. Like I said before, the first 2 or 3 episodes are good but then the story loose the line and the Angels are not important -except when they show up, which doesn't happens very often-. Not the best anime I saw, not the worst."
2,VHS was better,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is by far one of the best animes ever. Something like bringing it to DVD should have enhanced it. Though this was not the case. The DVD by far is horrible. They changed signs and paper to read in english which is an insult. The video quality is horrible everything looks still. The scenary is in total contrast to where it should be, it's horrible. The VHS is much better."
5,Quit your complaining? Come on...,"Ok, perhaps if you watch this DVD on a television, the poor quality may not be as noticeable but on a decent monitor you can tell it is at best a really good VHS. What a lot of people are complaining about is that the quality can be way better than what it is. If you have had the oppertunity to see the Japanese DVD release done by Gainax not ADV, you will know why the ADV release is so bad. And for you guys waiting on the second release, ADV has halted it due to the overwhelming feedback from people who think they did a pretty bad job on the first. So if you still think that this DVDs quality and editing are good/excellent you are in the minority."
1,Does not fit 2001 Rodeo!,"Contrary to website and package literature, this install kit does not fit a 2001 Isuzu Rodeo. The bracket hole positions do not line up and the bracket is recessed an inch too deep in the dash."
2,Great brand - bad model,"I've been using and testing Epson printers since the late '90s. This model is a lemon. Either it's the print drivers or the internal board, but it cannot reliably read the print commands. Multiple paper feeds occur before it finally starts to print (sometimes up to 10 sheets feed through without printing). Reinstalling the drivers has not worked. The quality on the best print setting continue to include lines and poor print artifacts on the correct paper (this is before or after cleaning), but printer is basically new. I'm not that surprised, the early printers were ""tanks"" like the 3000 I used to have, but the newer ones are built to fail and there is much less quality for your money spent. It's really too bad that the consumer priced printers are so poor. The high end printers continue to print incredibly well, but I'm not about to dump $5K into a printer for a 8.5x11"" print."
5,Great Printer,I love this printer... Ink is pricey but at least you don't have to replace them all at once. I like that there are individual cartridges so you only replace what's out.Great quality photo printing and prints directly on cd/dvd as well!
4,great printer,"I'm using Epson's ""Ultra Premium Presentation Paper Matte"" paper, images look great. I also used the ""Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy"" paper for smaller sized images. The colors are vibrant, but perhaps a bit too red and slightly over-saturated. I'm printing with Photoshop's default color profile and not Epson's, since Photoshop's starting point is more accurate (Epson's profile is too green). I've only had to tweak on the glossy prints, the archival matte surface paper is accurate from print number one."
5,Epson 1400,"I was looking for a printer that would do 12x12 pages. After reading the reviews I decided this one would fit my needs. And I was not disappointed. All my printers have been HP and I thought they printed out good photos. But this one is fabulous. Yes, the ink does disappear faster but at least I can track it every time I print. The photos are clear and crisp and I can now print on larger pages for my scrapbooking projects."
5,Exceeded My Expections,"Once I decided I wanted a CIS (continuous ink system), I had to decide which of the limited # of printers available for such a system would work for me. I like the all-in-ones because you don't have to give up so much of your desk space that multiple dedicated machines require. However, I wanted primarily to be able to print my own photos. Once I started researching I found the Epson 1400 consistantly received good reviews, plus it is a large-format printer that prints an impressive 13x19"" photo. The software was easy to install and I couldn't wait to print a photo. I was very impressed with the quality of that first photo, an 8x10 that looked as good as one printed by Costco. I highly recommend this printer for photos."
2,Disappointed,"After reading many positive reviews, I am disappointed about the quality of this printer. After printing only (5) 8 X 10 photos, I experienced lines across the photos, which I understand is a result of clogged print nozzles. Also - 2 of the ink cartridges are already so low that I had to order new ones and I've only had this printer for a week. I bought the printer from Amazon because it was the best price I could find. If it wasn't such a hassle to pack it up and take it to UPS, I'd probably return it. I also have an all-in-one HP printer that didn't cost much, but the quality is much better than the Epson 1400."
4,Great Print Quality!,"This printer is absolutely amazing! I bought it because I had to print over 20 pages for my fashion portfolio and didn't want to go to Kinko's to pay $11 per page. I was totally 99% pleased when I noticed the speed and print quality of this printer; it prints 13x19"" faster than my other printer prints on 8.5x11"" paper. It prints absolutely vibrant and accurate colors... What you see on the computer screen is how it prints on paper. I was able to print over 30 color pages (13x19) on the same cartridges and have not gotten a low level notification yet. For the price, this printer outweighs the other brands that cost $300-$500. I get so many compliments on the quality of the prints.PROS:Print Quality99% Color AccuracyPrint SpeedInk SaverEasy to SetupCON:The only negative thing is that it prints light gray as a teal green.- Still looks great... A Flaw that I can live with.Each Cartridge: $21.99"
2,Diappointing,"I've had this printer about six months, and it has really been a let-down. I bought it for photos and CDs.For a couple months it produced lovely photos. Now, the ink has to be recalibrated every time, which takes about 45 mins and pounds of ink. After calibration, it prints about 20 good-looking photos, and then they look like trash again.For such an expensive printer, I expected better.The CDs on the special tray always come out looking great. For that, I give this two stars. I wish I had bought a cheaper printer. I will NEVER buy another Epson."
2,A big Expensive Headache,"I bought this printer about 3 years ago on the recommendation of a friend. The up-side is that it makes beautiful prints. The down side is everything else about this machine. As an artist I make a lot of high quality prints of my work, and when using premium paper, and calculating that a set of ink is $120, A HQ 8x10 costs about $2. I estimate that I spend almost $500 a year on ink and paper. The other issue is that the paper feeder is very tempermental and often has to be hand-fed one sheet at a time. If there is even a slight flaw to the paper, it jams the rollers and eats the paper. Another consideration is that it is huge! about 3ft wide. Recently the printer has been giving me so much trouble I'm ready to throw it out. I need the large format, but this printer is a big expensive headache. Stay away."
1,A banding nightmare,I had high hope for this printer but turns out no amount of head cleaning and realignment can resolve the horizontal banding which gets worse toward both ends of every photo paper. I looked up the service manual which states it is a known problem and the top 1.58in and the bottom 1.7in of any page is affected. Such design should never enter production. Totally unacceptable for photo printing.
1,Worst photo printer I've owned,This is the worst printer I've owned. The print head has to be cleaned constantly or there is a line going thru pictures and letters. I have yet to get a good photo out of it. Next time I will stick with Cannon!
1,If you are looking for 13x19 prints think about switch brands or upgrading,This is the second large format printer I have owned. This printer does not print true borderless 13x19 prints -- It claims it does but it only will when it it set to enlarge the photo and crop the photo with out giving you a preview. If you turn off this setting it will leave a 1/8 to 1/4 of inch white edge on one side of the photo. The printer other than that has done well but most people do not purchase a large format printer to print 5x7 or 8x10. I wish I had purchase an HP again and not switched to Epson (nothing against epson my small format printer in Epson and I love it!)
4,Excellent printer,"First of all, I rated this printer at four stars only because its an ink hog. To be fair, I print high resolution photos so I suppose thats to be expected. As for the quality of prints, my friends ooh and ahh over them. I like the way it handles high-key landscape photos. In all, an excellent printer. Now, if they just made bulk magazine cartridges..."
1,Trash,"I'm going to keep this short because honestly, this printer isn't worth my time (or yours). When it prints correctly, it prints well, but this is a rare event. I picked up this printer after the printhead on my Canon i9900 went bad (after years of heavy usage). In comparison this Epson is awful. It prints at the wrong scale and in the wrong position on the page time and time again. I've worked through various settings and print from various file formats and programs and it prints correctly about 10% of the time. In addition, the paper feed is incredibly poor, requiring sheets to be repositioned for every page printed. An absolute nightmare to my workflow. Maybe my printer is a lemon, but regardless, the Epson software is nothing special either.Maybe for the discounted price this printer is worth it for some - but not me. I'd gladly pay the extra money for a new Canon if I could go back and do it over.One star for printing well when it prints correctly.Running on Mac OS X"
1,garbage,"these movies are very low budget pieces of garbage.the acting is horrible and the ""special effects"" are almost non existant.save your time and money,skip these films!"
4,Great deal!,"I bought this because there was a considerable discount included, but I really feel like I got more than my money's worth. Works great, right from the start. No problems or hitches at all. The picture is good, the sound is ok too, and I like that I can connect it to a TV to use as my regular DVD player. I haven't had any issues with it and I love that I can take it with me. Oh, and the battery charges very quickly too! It's great!"
5,Great product,I bought this DVD as a gift for someone in Europe.It worked fine for almost a month now (and it's been used a lot). Plus it played European DVDs.Very impressed.
1,broke in the first month,"Worked good for the first week, then the formatter went bad and we were instructed to take it to the local authorized repair shop. Three weeks later we're still waiting for the part. HP customer support is non existent. After three weeks agreed to accept a refurbished replacement but wanted a 1 year warranty, if the refurbished is just as good shouldn't they stand behind it as well? HP said no go and wanted me to pay to ship the refurbished printer. So if you want a printer that doesn't work and like to spend hours on the phone with tech and customer support, buy this printer."
1,Inadequate information,"It's too bad the information is inadequate. I have a GeForce4 MX 4000 graphics card, but it won't run the game because I don't have pixel shader 1.1, and you can't simply download this! Consequently, I have a disappointed child on Christmas Day. I wish the pixel shader requirement was more prominently advertised. Since there is no option for zero stars, which is what I'd give it, not having installed it successfully, the stars here indicate nothing!"
1,Tries to hard,"This novel tries to hard to be ""literary fiction"" but winds up being too self conscious and precious."
5,Stellar Entertainment!,Fantastic book! So funny and informative... She's like a celestial yenta... matchmaking by the stars. More more more!
2,hmmmmm,This cd has a real raw and gritty sound to it that you won't find on their other albums. The only bad thing is that all the songs sound just alike. When I first got it I stuck it into my cd player and started to listen to it and after about ten minutes I thought that this was 1 long song so I looked at the track number and it said number 3. I was shocked because those songs sounded the same. Sometimes I put this on the stero at work and turn it up because it it helps me get my work done faster. So in conclusion this is a good cd to listen to in the background at work but not good to listen to on headphones or in the car.
4,great,"great buy...arrived very quickly, in great condition and set up was very easy....fits in the car trunk just fine...just what we wanted."
4,As good as I hoped it would be,It has met my expectations and I am very happy with it. I can now gwt to my appointments without any difficulty
5,Great product at a great price !,"This Medline Transport Wheelchair is a premium product and we like it a great deal - especially the larger rear wheels. The only minor disapointment was its overall width - about 1 1/2"" wider than shown in the specifications. The price we paid on Amazon.com was a big plus - about $100 less than if we bought it at a retail store, and at least $40 less than anywhere else ""on-line"". Shipping was extremely fast (got it in about 4 days)."
5,Fabulous Product,"This chair is very light and easy to lift in and out of my car. As you can see it does not have big round wheels for the person sitting in it to use, it is for the caregiver. It is sturdy yet light weight. I received this chair within two business days of placing my order. I am extremely pleased with this product and highly recommend it."
5,Wheelchair,This lightweight chair is easy to handle especially with my back problem. It's easy to get it in and out of the van for my wife's use. She cannot walk far and this makes life a lot easier to deal with. Can't thank my daugher enough for purchasing this chair for her mother.GREAT CHAIRReview by a grateful father.
1,Piece of crap,"i purchased 2 of these wheelchairs and within a month or so the nuts were falling off, the footrests were super floppy, the brakes were loose and the whole thing just felt loose and wobbly. I had a patient ask if they were put together with paperclips. I had to quit using them because they were just too dangerous."
5,Good value,"My sister requires a transport chair when we go out in public. I specifically look forthe large rear wheel option that is lightweight and folds up. This chair is all of thatand very sturdy. Plus, it has a large carrier pocket on the back of the seat which isvery convenient. The most important thing is that I was able to purchase this for under$175.00. The price fluctuates wildly so do some research and wait. Amazon put this onsale and I jumped. F.Y.I.....This chair's brakes can only be locked into position by usinga handle on the side of each big tire and released the same way. This is sometimes quiteawkward and requires a lot of bending. Our previous chair was an Invacare and one couldlock the brakes by simply pushing the handles down and lifting them up to release....mucheasier. The handles on this chair push down to activate braking but will not lock the brakes.Otherwise, this was an excellent purchase."
5,transport chair,"This product is everything advertised, lightweight and easy to handle but sturdy. It fits easily into the trunk of my car and is easy to lift out. My passenger found it comfortable to sit in. We expect to use it regularly which will enable us to go places which require too much walking otherwise. I recommend this chair."
4,Serves the purpose,"Having no knowledge about wheel chairs, I relied exclusively on reviews when I urchased this wheelchair to transport my mother. Very easy to fold and transport and there is no assembly required except adding the foot rests. Overall a very good buy."
4,Medline Transport Wheelchair,"Overall, I like this wheelchair. It is lightweight, attractive, and relatively easy to handle. People who have limited upper body strength may have some difficulty putting the folded chair into the trunk of a car, as I do regularly.I like the larger rear wheels and the maneuverability of the chair it is very smooth riding, even on some bumpy concrete sidewalks. Most of all, my mother, who needs mobility assistance, likes it."
2,Wrong model number,"I ordered model number MDS808210AB, but they delivered model number MDS808210ABE. The difference is the wheel spoke and chromed attachments as depicted in the advertised picture. I just feel that I received a ""cheaper"" version."
2,not well made,"My 95 year old mother needed a new transport chair, so after doing an internet search I thought this one would be perfect. I must say it did come in a timely manner, but when I took it out of the box the right handle was loose. I tried to tighten it but I couldn't. Now after a few months of use the other handle is loose and the chair has become squeeky and wobbely."
4,What will you use these for?,"In the end, I decided these were fine for my purpose, but I nearly returned them when they first arrived. I purchased 24 to use for everyday in lieu of paper napkins, and they are a good price and quality for this. The problem with ordering a fabric item online is that you can't judge the hand, and the product description does not let you know that these are rather loosely woven and informal in appearance. I had hoped to buy napkins with a sateen finish, but that would probably require some serious ironing. These get pretty crumpled in the wash, and even after being ironed, they are not especially smooth or crisp. The combination of their price and softness make them a good selection for everyday or very casual entertaining, but do not get them for a more formal table."

1,1998 edition for Kindle,"Just download a sample and see for yourself. This ""Kindle Edition"" is a pure cheating. They ""kindeled"" an old 1998 edition for $49. The 2008 edition (printed) for $61 is MUCH more useful."
4,Ben Folds no Five,"For Ben Folds to step out from under his previously known band and create a solo album, one would never have expected it to sound quite so... EXACTLY THE SAME?!Whether its Ben Folds or Ben Folds Five, its obvious that Folds brings the majority of the music to the studio. His new solo release sounds just as Folds Five as any of the full band attempts would, and yet still seems to walk away slightly different. Tunes like the opener ""Annie Waits"" have an odd 80's feel to them that seems to spill over into other tracks in the album. Still the most radio friendly track of them all ""Rocking the Suburbs"" shows where Folds *should* have gone with this album. Sounding more like alternative rock and less like lounge piano whine, the track pokes fun at artists and groups who rely on computers in the studio to sell records.Overall its an upbeat travel through the quirky antics of Folds... but probably nothing new to fans."
5,WOW!,"To any fan of good solid music, ""Rockin the Suburbs"" is a must-have! Don't let the title fool you. This album is dripping with catchy tunes that you will be humming for months. Every day since I bought this album I've had at least one song from it stuck in my head; some of them were stuck for days at a time. But thats a good thing. If this is truly what Ben Folds is about, he should have dropped the ""Five"" along time ago. My current favorites are ""Losing Lisa"", ""Still Fighting It"", ""The Ascent of Stan"", and ""Not the Same"". Every song is a smash hit, with the possible exception of ""Rockin the Suburbs"", which is slowly growing on me. There is not a dud song on the whole CD. I can't wait to see him live next month! If your looking for a CD that you will be listening to for a long time, buy this album! It will NOT dissapoint!"
5,Fantastic!,"OK, I'll admit it- I wasn't really a fan before I got this album. One of my good friends is absolutely mad about the band, and when Ben's solo album came out, she insisted on playing it for me. I decided I liked it, and went out and bought it. I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did. It's one of those rare albums where you like every single song- on most other albums I own, I usually skip over a track or two (or more). ""Carrying Cathy"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, and ""Annie Waits"" is just such a great song. This CD really made me a fan. Go buy! You won't regret it."
5,Ben Folds at his Best,"I must say, I was kind of skeptical when I first heard that Ben Folds was putting out a solo album. I didn't know if it would be the same without the whole band. Boy, was I wrong. This album turned out to be better than anything done by BFF. I haven't stopped listening to it over and over since I got it about a week ago. My favorite song by far is Fred Jones pt. 2. The music is absolutely beautiful,and Folds and McCrea's voices blend so well. I'll have to agree that RtS is the worst song on the album, but it is still a great song. I would highly reccommend this album to all BFF fans. You will not be disappointed."
2,"A few decent songs, mostly pop schlock","This is certainly not the worst album I've heard or bought, but it's pretty far down there. I bought the album, like many, because of the title track because it was clever and fun. However the rest is pretty much pop ballads, and it becomes painfully obvious how important the other two members of the five were to Folds' creative process. It really is disappointing because Ben Folds Five is among my favorite bands."
5,rockin the suburbs,excelent cd very palatable for most music fans. Lots of good piano and hidden undertones. I had chills the first time i listened to this cd
4,A good book on guitars,"In this book Burrluck gives the reader the opportunity to learn more about guitar maintenance. I believe it covers most aspects of guitar maintenance, from easy things like changing strings to not so easy things like electronics and so on. My overall opinion is that it is a good book and i don't regret buying it. I can recommend it to people who are beginners (like me). The book covers both Fender and Gibson style guitars, so the book should be helpful to you no matter what guitar you're playing. I haven't read any other books on this topic so I can't compare the book to others."
2,Una Carta,"La Cancion suena bien, sin embargo no son las grabaciones originales de el grupo original Los Terricolas que fueron grabadas en los estudios de DISCOMODA"
5,Great brake rotors for 2005 Ford Escape,"I purchased these brake rotors to do a brake job on a 2005 Ford Escape XLT and they work very well. At the time of this review, we have had these rotors on the car for six months and when paired with Centric Posi-Quiet ceramic brake pads they are quiet, do not dust and have not had any issues warping. It also seems like the e-coating has helped with preventing corrosion to the degree that you would normally see on the rotors. I would not hesitate to recommend these or buy them again."
4,Great baklava for holiday parties or as a gift,This baklava is delicious! Had it around Christmas time last year and didn't find the batch to be excessively oily or low quality at all. It has a pinch of ground pistachio on the top which is a nice touch for your taste buds. I'm not a big fan of the sweets so this was perfect for my tastes. My mom even had me order two as holiday gifts (ordered a day after Christmas) and they arrived a week later.
4,Pretty good product,I'm not an amplifier specialist but overall this receiver does a pretty good job. The sound is crispy and it has far enough power for my needs. The only reason I don't put 5 stars is that it's not really good looking. But then that's pretty subjective...
3,Eh....it's okay for a minute...,"This is a stunning necklace...but not too terribly durable....not that I'm swinging from trees with it, I'm not...but it definitely isn't a 'keep on all the time' sort of chain if you know what I mean. For the occassional outing this is perfect...for an 'everyday' chain...not so good....It broke at the latch within a month of having it.....but again...I wore it everyday...which I now wouldn't advise..."
5,perfect chain,"Bought the chain for a pendant I purchased as a gift. Perfect match. Excellent. Fast ship, came with pendant."
2,SIze was OK..,"Well unlike some reviews, the length was OK... but the girlfriend wore it once and the next day the color was tarnished horribly. I guess I should have expected this."
5,CD Jewel Case Review,"Memorex CD Jewel Cases (50-Pack)I am in the process of converting all my vinyl records, classic I might add, to CD, and I first bought a box of blank CDs, but to my horror, they came without cases. I felt that I wanted do a proper conversion by cataloging titles and names of the artistes. The aforementioned Jewel Cases were just what the doctor ordered. Now I will have my classic music properly protected."
2,Music Dude from AZ,"If your an Urge Overkill fan like myself you WILL be disapointed. Unless of course your one of those people who like easy listening duets with corny sounding vocal tempos.There are only 3 maybe 4 tracks out of 13 that are worth listening to. The Rest of it is way to soft and strange sounding. Normally Nash's soft stuff is great, but this stuff is like easy listening music set to the sound track of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Seriously. Not what I expecting from Nash. I had been anticipating this CD for some time and was totally disapointed.Get rid of the duets, get back on the booze, call up King and tell him you need a swift kick. Then go and re-listen to All your Urge Stuff. That's what we want to here! Forget evolving! Leave that to shine-head o'conner and Cher!What's this generation comming to?"
4,Compact All-inOne Cleaner,"This is definitely a compact All-in-One Notebook cleaner. Had teh bristles of the brush been a bit longer, i would have give 5 stars. Working effectively."
1,"Dont buy this product, especially from this seller",I got this product recently and I am not satisfied with it.Though I have ordered for a new one they sent me a used product.The brush has very small bristles and using this brush may create scratches on the key board/monitor.Instead of buying this you can use a simple clean cloth for cleaning
5,Beyond Sonic Youth,"I'm one of those people who always thought Blonde Redhead sounded like Sonic Youth. The album cover caught my eye and when I saw who it was by I almost set it down and walked away. I'm glad I didn't. No longer do they sound like Sonic Youth. They now sound like Felt Mountain era Goldfrapp but playing live instruments. This isn't a bad thing, in fact, if BR continue to sound this good they'll become one of my favorite bands. The only complaint is that the songs are very similar. Fortunately, I love the song and therefore love the album."
4,beautiful,"I'm terrible at music reviews, but I think this is a beautiful album. I've played it for some people who cringe at the vocals. I'm perfectly aware this isn't for everyone. The more mainstream you are, the less you're going to like it.It's a slow, beautifully moody recording. Whether or not you can accept the whine of the vocals is up to you. If you don't like it on one track, you're not going to like it on any of the others."
1,seriously...why bother?,"virtually no thought or care went into this dvd collection. it just seems to be playing up the Star Wars angle with no real connection to it. here's why you should skip it:1. only 4 episodes(and one's already on dvd)2. no extras to make up for the fact there's only 4.3. no theme to this set(a cameo by mark hamill doesn't justify a star wars theme)do yourself a favor and either get one of their 5 episodes + a featurette set(like the christmas one). or better yet, save your ten bucks, add to it slowly, and then bust it open and buy those complete season sets as soon as they come out. at least those are well thought out and packed with extras. if you need a quick fix, watch a few episodes from your current seasonal sets. this bart wars disc just screams ""rip-off"" too much for me to cut it any slack."
1,Shameless attempt to cash in on the Star Wars franchise,"This isn't hard to figure out. Fox released the latest Star Wars film this past May and they also own the rights to the Simpsons. This DVD was released within a few days of the film's release.The episodes are all pretty good, but I'm not sure what the point of this was. It's good if you're a Simpsons fan who just wants something to view on a plane or long car trip. It's only 9 bucks, so it obviously was popular with the average fan.But if you're a hardcore fan like me who's collecting every season, you won't waste your money on this and instead wait for the next season to come out.It really depends on what you're looking for."
4,Awesome.,"Anywhosies, how are you today? I am awesome, I got the Weasley house ""The Burrow"" and I adore it. I am 13 years old and a complete Harry Potter extremist. This toy is amazing because it is HARRY POTTER and that in itself is brilliance, I wake up every morning looking at it (How weird is that?) I love Ron's little Chudley Cannon's room with the orange beds and degnoming the garden is also cool, the fireplace is great too. It's really cool, and it's Harry Potter, I mean how can you resist?~-I'm asking for the mirco Hogwarts for my birthday *expensive ain't it?* The more reviews I read of it the more I REALLY want it, the more I adore it to death and can't live without it. Ahem <goes back to being serious>~!"
1,This author has no respect,"The author has no respect. This book shows no recognition of the hard work of the original author, the late Christopher Schemering. Schemering wrote the first two editions and might still have control of the titled name of the book."
5,great item,this is a wonderful pair of speaker that I need for my car and thank you for a great item
2,"Gomer,s Speakers","I purchased these as a temp fix,because the original factory speakers were blown. If you plan to amp it thesespeakers won't fit the bill"
2,Get what you pay for,Installed these in a 95 Acura integra. After about 2 months they are blown. ( rattles on bass notes). I still have he factory radio so I can't imagine that it produces enough power to blow them.
5,great value,For the price they work great and sound really good very happy with them so far. Bass is ok for.these little guys and clear very little distortion at high volume.
1,Looks can be deceiving,"I bought this rosin for a student of mine. Upon initially taking the rosin out of its plastic case and attempting to rosin my student's bow, this rosin cracked down the middle completely, and broke apart into two crumbled halves. I decided to bite the bullet and give my student my cake of rosin instead of this. I expected a durable and quality product from Jade. I guess I was expecting too much. Disappointing."
4,Tap shoes a hit!,Purchased for a 7 year old - they were a hit! True to size - a little stiff - but I'm sure will soften up with use.
4,M foot dance,M first tap shoe and he like a lot. Did not blister feet. However we recommend purchasing half size larger for growing feet in the year.
5,Excellent reference,"This book is an invaluable source of information not only for those studying about various practical techniques but even those engaged in experiments in a lab environment. Written more as an overview, it works to familiarize the reader with the principles of both experimental protocols and the equipment that might be used, for example centrifuges. It's very useful to go back to it from time to time to get a refresher on techniques that I might use on a regular basis but might not remember all the details of. Highly recommended. It's also written quite simply, which unfortunately is not the case for all biology texts."
4,A discovery of the origins of Paul Bunyan-based on reality!,A wonderful history of lumbering and tree fellers in the 1800's. Particularly interesting account of a man named Joe Fournier who author claims; (and presents a valid case) was the lumberjack who set the poems and stories in motion that ended in the now legend of Paul Bunyan.
2,Why mess with a good thing?,"... The original orchestrations that were used in classic musicals such as Oklahoma! were great. Why are so many of these new cast recordings suffering from these hideous newer orchestrations? Take the new Annie Get Your Gun for example, horrible! This new 1998 Oklahoma! cast recording might appeal to listeners that are unfamiliar with the original cast or movie soundtracks. But once you've heard the real thing you'll never want to listen to anything else. For example, the ""Dream Ballet"" music in this new version stinks in comparison to the wonderful movie version, which so perfectly depicted the joy of Laurie's wedding day turning to horror at the hands of the menacing Jud Fry. Perhaps someday a truly complete version of Oklahoma! will be made that uses the glorious original orchestrations... Until that day comes, stick with the original cast or movie versions."
4,"once a hater, now a lover","I used to hate oklahoma! i am a fan of a large range of musicals but oklahoma never interested me. it has a good story line but before now it bored me to tears. then my boyfriend made me watch the new one and it was amaizing! this cast rejuvinated the story and made you feel for the characters. i like the ado annie/will turner storyline a lot better than the laura/curly storyline; however, hugh jackman was an amazing curly. the actress who played aunt eller was amaizing. this is a great album to add to your broadway colection."
5,Very happy!!,I ordered many things for my boyfriend for christmas. This live dvd was one of the items. I was so excited when I went to the post office on December 1st and found that it had already come in the mail! I ordered it on November 27th.. talk about great service!! I recommend this seller to anyone who is interesting in their merchandise! Thanks!!
3,"sterling silver celtic design oval pendant 18""","Sterling Silver Celtic Design Oval Pendant, 18""simple design, but the chain too short, still acceptable."
4,Wife loves it.,I bought this last year and my wife loves it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the chain is not the greatest quality and broke as it got caught on the corner of the box while it was shipped.
4,nice pendant,"If you like celtic designs, this is really nice. I love the pendant but didn't like the chain it came on..."
5,Safe and Still Useful,"We bought these for our kids and love them. They are the perfect size. They are comfortable to use. They are safe. And even though they are safe, they still actually cut paper!"
2,Not made in the U.S.A.,"My kids (currently 4 and 6) have been using these scissors for a year. They are sharp enough to cut paper, seem appropriately sized, and look like new despite consistent use. They serve their purpose very well. Still, when my daughter needed a pair to start first grade, I hesitated to buy them because they were all labeled Made in China. I work really hard to limit the amount of stuff I buy from China. I was thrilled when I found these on Amazon labeled Made in U.S.A, and disappointed when I recieved them. They are made in China."
4,New York user's manual,"This book has undergone some big changes from the last edition, namely in the format which is less readable than before. But Access doesn't get bogged down in history like other guidebooks feel obliged to do, and the listings are snappy without being smarmy like, notably, the Rough Guides. There could have been more listings downtown and some of the gay listings are out of date but for restaurants and hotels the book can't be beat. Too bad the reviews can't be downloaded onto a Palm Pilot."
1,Has anyone told the author how out-of-date he is?,"I have always loved the format of ACCESS books but to be honest, the last 3 guides to NYC have been very outdated. I feel as if the author has told a flunkie to ""check the websites"" of all the places listed in the book, and that the flunkie then quit his job and the author just published the edition from 10 years ago. I cannot continue to purchase the Access books knowing this is the case. I wonder if the author reads his own reviews on Amazon (I kind of doubt it). He should stop wasting his and our time by publishing out of date books."
2,Was this supposed to be a romance novel?,"The back cover of this book in no way let the reader know what she was in for. Had I known the heroine had been in an insane asylum for 3 years, I would not have touched the book. I have never cared for stories told in the ""first person,"" so that was initially a strike against this book for me also. While I have always admired the beauty of Katherine Sutcliffe's writing, this book was indeed a struggle to get through--the main male/female characters never even had a conversation until nearly 200 pages into the book much less had a chance to have any kind of progress toward a love story. Save your sheckels!"
2,not a bad effort but ....,"Franken is a DLC Democrat and he really believes we can prevail in Iraq. This is his biggest downfall, he and other DLC Democrats must realize when a war is lost.Only peace can be negotiated."
3,"Good, better....? - Just good","This volume pales in comparison to the masterpiece that was ""Neverness"". It would probably get a 9-10 if it was anybody else's first effort. Peripheral characters in the first volumes were fully developed people with detailed, interesting personalities. Here, they serve as mechanical plot devices with no existence other than their interaction with our protagonist. Enjoyable, but leaves me hankering to re-read ""Neverness"", again."
2,"Short on destinations, long on fly-fishing basics","Only 27 pages devoted to actual RMNP destinations and the rest a basic beginners guide to flyfishing. Better than nothing, but I recommend stopping by the Estes Angler for some real advice."
3,Beauty of Ireland,"The photography is very good, and the musical accompanyment is enjoyable, but I kept hoping that a narrator would tell me what I am looking at and maybe a short commentary on the scene."
3,Very strange movie...,"A young man is trying to decide if aliens are going to take over the earth at the turn of the millenium. He journeys to Area 51 and meets some very strange people, contrasted well by his deadpan dedication to his journey."
5,Great singer,"It is such a treat to see and hear this late, great artist. Amazing that this voice comes out of such a man and you can tell he is truly singing of his heritage. Great performance."
3,"Pretty good, prefer his CDs","I don't think I would have purchased it if I would have seen a preview, but his music is still great. I expect more when I purchase a entertainer's DVD."
4,video,Good I had never seen this available any where else. My Husband is a Fan of Bro IZ and he was very excited to get it.
1,Half painted bycicle,"I ordered the Pt Cruiser Tour Edition for my daughter birthday.When it arrived....it was not the same bycicle showed in thepicture!! In the one that I received the fenders were plainugly crome color. I sent it back and soon after I received thereplacement, still on time for my daughter birthday. What a great service! However, they forgot to paint the fenders in the second bycicle too! End of the story I had to sent the second bycicle back and rush to get a bycicle someplace else ontime for my daughter birthday. Don't get this bycicle unless you are willing to finish the painting job!"
5,Wasa and I,"I was thrilled to find this crispbread on Amazon. It is a big part of my dietary needs. If I get hungry, but don't want much but would like a little sweet, I just have Wasa crispbread (any variety)and peanut butter. It is filling and tasty."
3,Very sturdy too small,The toilet seat is way too small and they don't make it any bigger... splashguard is very flimsy plastic and it has already cracked since I purchased this a month ago ... construction is very Sturdy.
5,A good purchase,"I ordered this for my recovery from hip replacement surgery. It arrived nearly completely assembled in great condition.Adjusting the height was easy and intuitive, the construction was sturdy and the arm height was perfect."
4,shipped not completely assembled,"I chose this model because I understood it was shipped assembled. When my 97 year old dad received it, it took him several hours to put it together. If I had known it was not assembled, would have had it shipped to my home and we would have put it together and driven the 4-hour round trip to deliver it to my dad.Once assembled, it met the needs of my elderly parents, as an over the toilet commode."
3,Kinda ok,"As soon as I started to read the book, it felt like I could not put it down - up until the moment it felt like the book was streching on and on, trying not to reveal the past of the main character. That lost my interest."
3,Happy Hour,"This movie is not bad. The story's plot is somewhat similar to the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", except for the fact that it does not involve the theme of racial prejudice."
2,Buyer Beware!,This product is now made in China. Buyer Beware! It's definitely not worth the premium price.
2,"Alright, but nothing to rave about","The scissor is alright, but nothing to rave about. Its a scissor for gods sake. Its just not that high-tech."
5,The Glory of Being Left-Handed,"I recently purchased a pair of Bent Multi-Purpose Scissors for my niece who is left-handed. For years she has struggled with products made for right-handed people but has never uttered a word to describe the awkwardness she experienced. To my delight, she immediately picked up these scissors and could cut without any pain! I had never really thought about being left-handed and how that might impose a number of problems but I now view being left-handed as being a special gift when I see how happy my niece is!"
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"I've had these scissors for several years (they're sitting on my desk by my computer right now.) I absolutely love them! Not only are they easy to use, they have also stayed sharp through average use without any need for sharpening. I definitely recommend these for any lefty!"
3,o.k. product,"We needed new phones for the house. The system is easy to set up and use. A dislike is volume on the phone. It is not very loud and we have trouble hearing the person on the other end. I have tried adjusting the volume, but it still is not very loud. Range is not as far as my previous phone."
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series Dual Handset Cordless Phone,"It's a nice compact model, sturdy, and the battery lasts a long time. Overall it's a good product. It's hard to get rid of missed calls from the display and it will not display the date and time until you do so."
2,Panasonic phone flop,All of the cordless handsets (I bought 4) work fine all over our large house and even down in the basement. The problem is that the main base answering system's speakers or amplifier were hardlly adequate to discern the message. I had two calls and had to put my ear to the speaker (turned on as loud as permitted) but still couldn't make out the message! We had to go back to our old Uniden answering machine and just use the Panasonic extra handsets.
3,Not bad for the money,"This phone is decent for the money, but I expected more. You have to separately store numbers in the address book in both handsets. The voice clarity sometimes fades in and out a little, and you cannot set your own ring tone. Otherwise it seems to be a good phone."
5,So Far So Good,I have had my new phones a few weeks now and I'm very happy with them. If the phone has an audible signal for messages mine is not activated and I'm quite happy its minus the annoying signals. I haven't recorded a message yet but I have nothing to complain about.
4,Great phones,Crystal clear reception and decent battery life. Haven't tested the range yet. But overall the best phone I have owned.
4,impressed,"I had no idea how bad my old phone was until I bought this one. The sound is good, the charge lasts a long time. Not real impressed with the feel against the ear but I use a headset for long or frequent calls and that works well for me. Panasonic makes the best phone for the money."
5,Great Value,"I replaced an older 2.4 ghz Uniden phone. The uniden phone acted up badly with my wireless network.I research several phones before I settled on the Panasonic. After using it, I must say I believe I made a great choice.The phone is very easy to set up. The phone needs to charge for 7 hours before you can use it. And the wall mount sticks out from the wall a little, but otherwise works and looks fine.The range is excellent. We have had no trouble using the phone from a range perpective throughout our 3 bedroom home.The listening and speaking quality is very good. Since there is not interference with my wireless network, I find the audio quality a strong point.The controls are easy to understand.It is a great phone at a great value."
4,Worth the price,"I really appreciate these phones. I had a couple of GE phones until I bought these Panasonics. The GE model was TERRIBLE. I'm not sure if it was because of wireless interference or not. In any case, I ""inherited"" a different Panasonic cordless from my grandmother, who didn't need it. I was very satisfied with that handset, so I decided to try out these Panasonic handsets, as well. They're great! The sound quality and range are both great!"
2,Last order you will rec from me????,I will never order from you again.Very poor service.You ripped me off over charge me.did not send what i order .check you so called A-TO-Z And you will see what I'M talking about.And Close my Account(NOW) I'll never buy from you again.And I'M going to let all my friends no how you ripped me off.Allan
3,Range not as good as expected,"We like most things about this phone with the exception of the range. Although most reviews seemed to suggest that this phone has good range, we found otherwise. We have a pretty small one story home, and we placed the base station on side. If we take the handset to the other end of the house we don't get any reception. Maybe we configured something wrong, but we haven't found a solution."
1,"Choppy sound and static, especially for callers on the other end","Almost everyone we talked with complained about static and choppy sound quality on their end. On our end, sometimes the sound would drop off. No other phone feature can make up for this significant audio defect."
1,the telephone that broke after a month,"Hi:I haven't used this telephone very much since I bought it, the LCD on one of the hand set went blank, and it shows nothing. Very unhappy with this purchase. I guess it is a chinese made low quality electronic. I have an original Panasonic made by Japan had no problem whatsoever. I can't even give it back because I didn't keep the original box."
4,panasonic telephone,Pleased with operation and price. Had trouble with one charger therefore returned the entire product.
3,Generally worth it,"goods: sound quality, features are good, intercom is nice, speaker phone is excellent.bads: the menu system sucks very big you know whats. Not intuitive at all.overall though its worth the @@ if you need a decent phone."
5,Just what I wanted,"Large buttons on handsets are a plus. Simple to use base features. Excellent sound quality throughout the house. Does not interfere with and is not affected by my wireless computer setup. So far, so good."
4,"Good phone, not perfect","This phone is good, but not great. It can sound like you are talking in a tin can sometimes, but not all the time. Usually sounds pretty good. I don't like the selection of ring tones, there is no ""normal"" one. I don't like the menu system that much. You have to press the same button twice to see the caller ID list for missed calls.The intercom system works well. It goes from the basement to the second floor just fine (base station on first floor)."
4,Good choice,"I purchased this set to solve the problem of only having one phone jack but wanting two phones. The voice messages are clear, styling is great, and it was simple to program my numbers into the phone directory. I like the product....the only drawback for me is the chintzy way it becomes a wall mounted phone. I don't care for the ""shelf"" effect. I'd like it to hang flat against the wall, or not be described as wall mountable."
1,The Worst,"I have purchased Panasonic phones for years now, and they've all been great. This is the worst phone I have ever used. They have only been in use about a month for me now and the sound cuts in and out. People tell me the call is breaking up all the time. It know it's not my line as when I use another phone I have, everything is fine. And from my perspective the incoming voices go louder and softer, as does my voice as I hear it in the phone. If I had purchased these at a store they would have been returned immediately. Don't buy this model!!!"
4,Very Nice,"This is a very nice phone with a number of easy to use features including complete control of the answering machine from the handset. When the answering machine answers, it plays through the handset as well. Great for screening calls. The only bad thing I have encountered with it is that, when on the other side of the house, the phone will not pick up the ringer signal. No problem with the voice range though. All in all it's a great phone but I'm only giving it five stars because of the poor ringer range.UPDATE:Besides any minor problems I mentioned above, I've had these phones now for 3 years and they still work just fine. I've only had to replace the rechargeable batteries that came with them once."
5,Panasonic Cordless Phone with Answering Machine,"So far, So good! This seems to be a quality product with many useful features. We are quite pleased with it's capabilities."
4,cordless phone,well made. good sound clarity. impossible to figure out how to program and leave messages. i miss the simple phones from 5 years ago.
5,Best phone ever!,"I love this phone!!! My previous phone had all sorts of problems..It would die after a 15 minute conversation and would take forever to recharge (even with a new battery). This Panasonic has crystal sound, is easy to set up, and lasts forever. I've carried it around the neighborhood and out to the garage, and never lost reception. If you need a phone, this one is definitely worth the investment!"
1,Big Disappointment,"Although the styling is very cool, the product received was a big disappointment. The box was not sealed well and some parts were loose and lost in the box. The bike had scratches on it. It was very difficult to assemble. The directions that came with the bike applied to different models. I called the service number and they told me there wasn't a set a directions that were specific to this bike. I tried to tell the guy which parts I was missing, but because I didn't have a parts manual, I was left to describe the part. I was finally able to communicate with him. Although the bike was built to look like it was made in the 50's I noticed it didn't include new technology such as an easily adjustable seat. However, the kickstand was not an old style heavy duty one like in years past. Rather, it was a skinny cheap one that doesn't look like it will hold up. This bike was such a disappointment, I doubt I'd buy a Chrysler product (including cars) again."
2,The old bait and switch,"I ordered matching women's and men's Chrysler PT cruiser tour edition bikes and when they arrived I knew something was wrong because one of the boxes looked as if it was opened and repacked. Both bikes were to have blue frames and fenders but the women's bike had two dented chrome fenders, plus the box with the pedals and the owners manual was missing along with two screws for the fender. I had to go to the bike store and purchase screws and pedals. I feel like I got a second hand bike with spare parts."
5,"Favorite Alltime Movie, Excellent Soundtrack!",Absolute favorite movie of all time. I've bought a copy for a friend and for myself. I've done the same for the soundtrack. The violinists and oboists are phenomenas to hear. I recommend this as well as Andrea Bocelli's CDs. Soothing music.
2,"Unfortunately, it is great storytelling","because it is viciously racist against Malaysians and Japanese(I regret that I have to give the author credit for great storytelling, hence the word ""unfortunately"")This novel is placed in the Pacific zone of WWII.Possibly the character that the author admires most is a blond, blue-eyed Australian boy who survives on his own on an enemy occupied island, in spite of a knife wound to the stomach. ""Australia puts out some pretty tough boys,"" muses the American pilot protagonist."
4,Kingfish for President,"Approaching the 1936 Presidential election, Louisiana Governor Huey Long details a political fantasy where he is president of the United States. Through imaginary conversations with men of power, his aspirations including the ""Share the Wealth"" plan are presented."
2,Not Multidirectional,This antenna was to replace an 10 year old conventional UHF-VHF antenna that functioned fine before the switch to digital TV. After the switch we started losing stations so I thought to replace the old one with this product. We are less than 60 miles from our major stations and this one was not only unable to get more stations but was as sensitive to direction as the old one. Needless to say I put back the old one and sent this one back. It did not function as a multidirectional 70 mile antenna..
4,it works!!,"I live in SW Florida, fringe area (65 miles) from Ft Myers. DB8 came on time and good shape - thanks amazon! Instructions were weak but easy enough to figure out. installed easy outside, pointed towards transmitters and without pre amp, picked up 12 stations, 16 late nite. You do need to zero in on the towers - tuner has meter and loud tone - so I was able to key in on towers. I did get drop outs or pixels with wind & storm.I order the CM 7777 Pre amp from Amazon. Now 18 stations are rock solid. Meter readings changed from 35 - 45% to 60 - 70%. No more drop out or Pixels. Thanks Amazon...another satified customer!!"
3,terrible assembly instructions,this is a good antenna because I have bought and installed 2 for other family members. This one did not have holes drilled in one of the bars for the cross supports. Assembly instructions are useless.
3,"Deep fringe claims maybe overstated, so I may double up","I had high hopes for improved signal over 7' long conventional style deep fringe antenna.Unfortunately was not equal existing unit. Tried swapping leads, etc, between sides with no difference.I would recommend going to largest antenna such as this DB8 over smaller units whenever ordering.Construction seems like good materials, coatings and attention to detail.Considering doubling up two units to get signal I need in my deep fringe area, as even double amps I use do not boost uncaptured signals.Maybe they will make doubles or quads for people in remote areas."
3,works,Your really need to purchase the booster if you live out in the country. The few channels that I can pick up look really good.
2,Digital Antenna vs Existing Antenna,With the change to all digital local broadcast I purchased this antenna to replace my very old antenna to improve signal quality. It did very little for my signal strength on one channel in perticular and not much on the other channels. I had hoped for a much better improvement than I got. Not sure how to resolve this problem.Ron
3,Better than rabbit ears,"We have installed the antenna on the roof. With rabbit ears, we could get two stations. With the new antenna, depending on the weather, we can get eight stations. Most of the new stations are digital and they come in very clear when they are not breaking up. Right now, the only tv that we have hooked up is a digital tv. We have converter boxes for the other tvs, but have not hooked them up yet."
2,hdtv antenna,"Nice looking product, but I could not get it to bring in any signal, this may be in part to my location.Personel dept needs some aditude ajusting, my refund was handled through a third party.Confusing, won't order from that place again."
4,antenna,"We had previously purchased the DB4, it worked pretty well, so assumed that this would be twice as good. We are 30-40 miles from most of the TV stations. I couldn't tell any difference between the DB4 and DB8, but you can only adjust the DB8 so far. My situation could be different than others, so I'm not saying don't buy the DB8, I'm just saying for me the DB4 worked just as well, and was less expensive."
4,Much better signal,Go to www.antennaweb.org and configure where you should point your antenna. We did this and installed the antenna. We received at least 12 more stations and very good reception. Better than we have had in many years.
2,Did Not Work As Well For Me,"Although the antenna appeared to be of good quality and went together fairly easily, I had expected it to be stronger than my old 12-year-old old-style antenna that I already had in the attic. So I was disappointed when my TV indicated that all of the channels were in fact several digits (out of 100) weaker than before. I even tried ganging it together with my old antenna, but that did not work better either. So I left my old antenna in place, took apart the new one, and returned it. Of course, your mileage may vary."
5,great over-the-air HD,I put it in my attic and get dozens of channels in HD (in SF Bay area). Not even sensitive to direction. Works with TV and TiVo. Split signal to stereo for FM too. Total costs less than 1 month Comcast.
1,Super small! Cheaply made!,"This claims to be for ages 4-12. It is so small it hardly fits my 4 year old, let alone my 9 year old who I bought it for. It is displayed in blue, which I wanted, but I received orange. I do not recall seeing a disclosure that color assortment may vary. I see the price has gone down, but I paid much more. Huge waste of money!"
4,Finance Is Finance,"Stern and Chew bring together some better than average work into finance. If you have plowed through as many finance texts as I have during undergrad, graduate, and now post-grad work, you know how old this stuff can get. They have managed to bring in good information from a number of sources that didn't put me to sleep and actually taught me a thing or two when I had previously fooled myself into believeing I knew it all. Good book!"
5,A Quality Product,These are very tasty and just the right size. It make an excellent Christmas gift for my wife that we could share with others.
3,Slow delivery,"Paid for fast delivery; this means I ordered on a Monday morning, ships Tuesday morning, won't get to the location 1 state away until the following Monday..... what's wrong with this picture? Might as well save the extra shipping costs."
3,Great for Light Use,This is a great product for cutting things like grass and single sheets of paper. I found this in the homedepot isle with yard sheers. I mistakenly used it to try to open a package of weed eater yarn and it was destroyed. Great for light use but be weary if planning to open something that maybe a pocket knife is better suited for.
3,Great scissors with one annoying disappointment,"I use these scissors a lot, as they're in general great scissors. They'll easily cut through several layers, including a combination I often use of felted wool, woven interfacing, and fusible fleece. The only problem is the little orange catch -- it often slides forward during a cut so that I can't complete the cut until I push the catch back again. This has turned what would have been a five-star review into a three-star, as it happens a lot and is very annoying. From the rest of the reviews, I see this isn't a common problem but does happen occasionally. If they'd fix this, these would be hands-down my favorite scissors."
1,John Donne was wrong...,"John Edgar Wideman plainly considers himself ""an island entire unto himself"". Foolish me, I interpreted the title of this book to mean that The Island in question was Martinique, and on that basis I bought the book to read on a flight to Fort de France. Even with nothing else to read but the in-flight shopping mag, I couldn't get past page 37 of this pretentious, self-indulgent, narcissistic tour of the hotel bedrooms of the Caribbean. I'll put myself at risk by confessing that I thought seriously about sky-jacking the plane to the nearest news stand. Sample:""Silence as a counterpoint, counterweight to the fugue of many voices, many languages buzzing imperiously, incomprehensibly around you. Silence as an answer. A rejoinder to chaos.""A hundred sixty-five pages of such bombast! Think of it! Without even an in-flight Adam Sandler movie to take refuge in!"
1,Bad quality,"cheap wood, left over material, wood filler used to fill in gaps in the bokken. a bit disappointing. One already broke."
2,No noticeable difference,"I don't see any improvement after having used this. The DVD player which has developed occasional read problems still has them even after being ""cleaned"" several times with the Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner. Blowing the unit out with canned air does a much better job for me."
3,LIked but it has its limitations,"I bought these thinking they would be easier than paint if we wanted to do some quick art and have fun without the mess however I was disappointed as they rubbed off very easily and if left outside when it is warm they will get so soft you cannot use them. So I have mixed feelings about them: easy to use but they have their limitations. The book, however, had some great ideas."
4,Covers the topic,Book seems to cover the topic and gives some very helpful financial guidelines for negotiating a settlement. Something most of us do not have experience doing.
4,Good Book,If you want to educate yourself about the process of your claim and be able to follow along with what your lawyer is doing then great. It was informative and insightful.
2,"Great friction, except doesn't stick on water sealer",A great product except it does not stick on primer-ed surface (water sealed)-put on before water-sealing! good luck =) =)
4,LONG JOURNEY HOME,"I coudn't put the book down from the time I readthe first page. I was so moved by the reality of it all.One mans struggle to free himself, and find God. the betrayalthat he trys to come to grips with. and the sanity that hehas long lost. But now found.This book was fast paced, andfilled with action. love, betrayal, forgiveness and comingto grips with himslf for the sins he has commited."
5,A Real Reality Check,"We've heard so much in the media about the War in Iraq, but reading ""I Am My Brother's Keeper, Journal of a Gunny in Iraq"" brings to life what it's like to be in the line of action and what every day life is like for the soldiers. This book will touch your heart. You feel the bond of the brothers and the heartache that happens when a brother is gone. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has any question as to why we are in Iraq. There are tears of joy when the troops are given a heroes welcome for freeing the people and tears of sorrow when hearing about the anguish that the soldiers endured in order to accomplish their mission. I shed many tears at the end of the book. These men are our true heroes."
4,An excellent RPG,"It is a good RPG, with rules covering every imaginable problem and is not limited to generic fantasy. It also encourages puzzle-solving over hack-and-slash, unlike AD&D. However, because of its many rules, it isn't very flexible. That took it down to 9, and the fact that Rifts looks better took it down another."
4,Nice size,I've bought similiar earrings before & they always seemed a little too small These are a nice size & colors are lovely
5,Awesome teether!,"This teether is great because it isn't expensive and it massages tender gums so they don't hurt as much.**Makes a great baby shower gift.** (Wink, Wink) :c)"
1,Too small,"Product is way too small compared to the picture. I returned it only to find all the shipping charges and handling fees....were deducted from my total. By the time they were finished charging me for this and that-I only got half my money back. It will be a very, very long time-if ever- before I purchase anything from Amazon! Thanks for the fine print."
1,It's Like a bounced check.,"Lookout records double cd is a compilation of various (artists?????)Lookout records collected a bunch of garage bands for this cd,that never should have found their way out of the garage. It must have been the neighbors that called lookout records to get these bands out of their neigborhoods.Who forgot to hide the garage door opener?Ifyou get a couple of garbage can lids andscream alot you might be able to get signed by lookout records too.Out of all the bands on this cd there were a few that show promise,the grovie ghoulies,squirtgun and the queers.So as warning to those who might buy this cd lookout lead doesn't bounce."
1,Rope fades yellow onto clothing,"This travel clothesline was a good idea, until I actually hung up wet clothes. The yellow from the clothesline bled onto all the light colored items. Each item now has a dyed yellow line running across it. Ruined my white underclothing. The clothesline I purchased is now in a garbage can in Germany."
5,Beauty. Courage.,"We picked this book up at the giftshop of a local lighthouse and I am SOOO glad. What a treasure! The illustrations are gorgeous, first of all... which will immediately draw you in.And the story is a perfect piece of history to share with children. I'm keeping this for our lighthouse studies this summer... I'm convinced that it's the best lighthouse story out there.Finally, maybe it's just because I'm pregnant right now, but the story was so well written and so moving, it brought tears to my eyes at the end. What a lovely example of father/daughter love and true courage...Enjoy this one; it's a treat!!!"
5,a good cd,this cd makes me wish that i had a zoo. i like the music and the words are fun to say. my mom likes this cd because it makes me want to eap my supper. the end
4,Easy to read and bolsters your confidence,"The illustrations are very clear and make improvisation possible. This book helped me save hundreds of dollars on my own veil - without anyone guessing that I made it myself! With very little sewing background, I owe it all to the book."
2,Poor visuals and out of date styles,"I was not impressed with the quality of this book. The instructions are informative and easy to follow but the headpiece designes are out of date. The pictures are hand drawn and do not capture the instructions they are depicting. I have learned about the steps and general techniques of veil making after reading this book. However, I think color photos and updated designes would be helpful."
2,Not as good as expected,"I played and successfully beat the PC version of The Fellowship and I was excited when I had the chance to play the Two Towers on GameCube. However, the game was worse than I expected. From the first 10 minutes of playing, I was confused and bored. It is hard to tell which character you are controlling especially in the opening sequences because there are so many NPCs floating around. The graphics are pretty bad for a Gamecube game and there is no strategy at all; simply fight and fight and chop. Do not buy this game; you will be sadly disappointed."
4,I Love The Two Towers,"I can't wait till this awsome game comes out.I'll probably pick Aragorn to go kick some orc,uruk-hai and cave troll butt.I can't wait 12 levels of non stop fighting.I really thing every one should get the two towers January 1st."
5,I Play This Continually While I Drive My Police Interceptor,"These Jazz Stars are backed up by Jimmy Dorsey on all of the reeds in a small combo -- and some famous popular composers when they were just starting out as Ricky-Tick Vocalists! The Tempo is Mostly Up and the Audio Quality Very Good. I Play This Continually While I Drive My WIFE'S Police Interceptor (a Crown Vic with the ""Touring Option""). It is nice to drive a musical sedan that goes like my '86 GT Mustang."
4,Helpful,"The book is a very present help to a writer, it is laid out in a manner that makes it easily adaptable to one's writing. I recommend this book to all writers.Dr. RPW"
4,I like it!,"I've had the Oregon Scientific Professional Weather Station for 6+ years (model WMR968) and I love it. I have had the thermometer/hygrometer sensor fail but it was easily replaced. I bought additional indoor wireless sensors and they were easily added to the system (I have a total of three indoor and one outdoor). I love knowing what the temperature/humidity is indoors and it varys greatly at times. The system lets me make appropriate adjustments to ensure our indoor conditions are comfortable. Knowing what the weather is like outside, right outside my door, not 5 or more miles away, is wonderful. I found this system to be reliable, amazingly resiliant and definitely something I would not only recommend but would purchase again."
4,Handy Map,"Useful map to have, folds up neat and thin. Has good info.I used it in conjunction with the Insight guide to Jamaica,as I found it useful to locate the places I was reading about in there on a larger map.A good buy for the tourist/travellor."
5,love it,"I love these shoes, very comfy.Runs a little small, since I normally go for 5 1/2 but with kenneth cole reaction i have to wear 6.however, the shoes i received, the material were a little wavily shrunk on the sides.I dont think thats how it supposed to be, but since i got the black ones so its not visible."
1,Not what I expected,"The necklace I purchased was not what I had anticipated. It was more dainty, like for a lady. The chain was flimsy and the charm was thin. When the box arrived, the necklace was floating loosely within the box. There was a gift box inside along with the little black, velvet gift bag. They were both closed. Not very professional packaging. I have always had good service with Amazon but not this time."
3,chain,"The chain turns black after a while, but over all, to me. it looks good. for the price they shuold make it all stainless steel. not only the medal."
3,Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters ~Soundtrack~,"I have to assume, since the movie isn't out yet, that this soundtrack is the perfect accompaniment for what is shaping up to be a hysterical film. Contributions from Mastodon, Unearth, Andrew W.K, and 9lb Hammer are amongst the few artists on the album that make the disc even more amusing. If you're already a fan of Aqua Teen, 9lb Hammers """"Carl's Theme"""" is a must listen. Lines such as ""I will break into your house and tear your wife in half"" from Mastodon and the Meatwad endorsed Unearth song about friendship keep the album interesting. The Unearth song actually sounds more like an Every Time I Die song then though the solo is still very much in the Unearth style.It's tough to say if this disc will be worth much to anyone just on-board for pure musicality... but if you enjoy humor mixed with a little metal and you're an Aqua Teen fan, you'll need this disc if not just for Master Shake's """"Nude Love (reprise)."
3,Not that big of a deal,"I purchased this items for my 15 year old son, but he's not really into it that much, only one or two songs he listens too, waste of money on my account."
4,Weeeeeeeeeeeeird.,"Julia Leigh has succeeded in one thing with this book: she leaves a lasting image on the reader. Everything--from writing in present tense to giving her main character only a letter for a name--suggests she's more poet than novelist and definitely more neo than classical. While development goes from fascinating to creepy, the reader can't help but read, read, read...and you just can't escape. It's like a train wreck--you just can't look away."
2,A good story by a bad writer.,"As interesting as the story is, The Hunter, I felt, was poorly written. The main caracter's mission is hazy at best, his location is never mentioned (they never say he's in Tasmania, the only clue is references to Tasmanian tigers and devils), and his prey itself, the Thylacine, is not mentiond until almost half way through the book. the book jacket says he is employed by a biotech company, but that also is never mentioned in the text. I puchased this book because I have an acedemic interest in Thylacinus Cynocephalus, the Tasmaninan tiger or thylacine, but the book gave little information on the creature, only loosley describing it's appearance. I would describe the writing in the book mediocre at best, but the story is half-decent. Due to the poor writing style, I feel that The Hunter is doomed."
4,A spell for Chameleon,"This book reminds me of those written by Mercedes Lackey and J.K. Rowling. It deals with the same types of magic and good and evil. If you liked those books, you'll enjoy this one too."
5,The best Book in print Now and forever,"This book is the first of the Xanth series. It is one of the most imaginitive books ever written. For you mundanes Xanth is a magical realm of magic and fantasy. Things are literal there. One warning though, when you finish this one you will be hooked on Xanth for life! You will never stop reading xanth novels."
5,Great Book,"I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the first novel I've read by anthony, but it won't be the last. This book has done a great job with fantasy wrighting. I recomend this book to all.P.S. if you like my review e-mail me.P.S.S. I'm a 6th grader!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A spell for chameleon book review,"This book takes place in an enchanted land called Xanth. (Xanth looks strangely like Florida.) The main character is named Bink and he has no magic so he goes on a quest for his magic. On his quest he meets Crombie the solder, Fanchon, a manticora, and the evil magician Trent.I recommend this book because it has a lot of action in it. It is an adult book for middle school and up. I give it four stars."
3,Worth a read through more than once,"This book deserves attention from readers of all ages. It tells a tale of fantasy that appeals to the young. It contemplates morality and and questions the ethics and beliefs of the characters in the book and causes the reader to question his own at the same time. These kind of books make one think and reevaluate themselves by putting the reader into the role of the protagonist and antagonist. The story-telling is decent but sometimes gets mired in too much background and detail, which causes one to lose focus on the current plot point. But, all in all, it deserves reading and offers a lot of interesting story arcs and keeps one glued to the book. A good read."
2,First admission into an infantine world,"I finally found this very first book all about Piers Anthony's amusing little fantasy playroom of Xanth for any young kid who could read. Unfortunately, I didn't get very far - especially after my unfortunate experience with the other Xanth book, ""Ogre Ogre"", which carried so many blatantly sexual references to the female characters as well as lecherous behavior from the males. This book here very obviously has the same thing. Too bad I'm female and WELL over the age limit. In fact, I was actually THE SAME AGE as the hero, who was about 25 at the time. So the double standards prevented me from taking a carefree romp into Uncle Piers' Fun-'N'-Pun Land. Oh, well - too many unwashed little boys and street punks casually hanging around it. They would probably grow donkey's ears in time."
4,"Keith is back, and he's still Keith","This album is a collabo between Kool Keith, H Bomb, and Marc Live. The beats are bouncy synth style. Keith is hilarious, and the album is great. KHM is refreshing, showing the lame tactics of commercial rap. The cover art is incredibly lame, but besides that, this album is tight."
2,Antonio should forget it . . .,"This is a bleak, dismal version of what is admittedly a problem play. Antonio is clinically depressed, Basanio is boring, Portia couldn't win a case in traffic court.Try Al Pacino's version. MUCH better."
4,A Merchant to See,"If you are a fan of The Merchant of Venice but were disappointed by Al Pacino's Shylock this DVD may be for you. Henry Goodman brings a grounded and passionate honesty to the role that Pacino sorely lacked. Although, I was not impressed by David Bamber as Antonio (boring) or Derbhle Crotty as Portia (lacking any real substance; Raymond Coulthard as the Prince of Arragon is historical and steals his scene. The show worked better on stage than it does as a filmed version but it is still well worth a viewing."
5,Great for Batman and Batgirl fans!,"This is the best of the Batman ""decade"" collections...much more thought-out than ""Batman In The Fifties"" and funner and more interesting than ""Batman In The Seventies."" While Bat-Girl (Betty Kane), Bat-Mite and Batwoman (Kathy Kane) show up briefly, the majority of the book focuses on Batman and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon). The art is great and the stories are smart and fun.Plus, fans of the Batman TV show will enjoy this collection. While not as dim-witted as the TV show, this collection is just as fun!!!"
2,Another Point of View...,"... and it looks like I'm in the minority, but I detest this performance. Two stars are one too many, but it IS Bach, and almost recognizable as such. A huge bellowing, groaning chorus! An orchestra with no sense of Baroque phrasing! Sunday morning soloists! Fuzzy recording!Why should I bother to review this fiasco? Because it's the performance included in the Brilliant Classics 155-CD Bach Edition, and I've just gotten around to listening to it. The more I listen to the whole compendium, the less thrilled I get with it. Well, I'm still glad to have it, but I find fewer and fewer reasons to recommend it."
3,good for the money,im 18 and put these in my 4door 95 grand am gt their ok worth the money lows are really good
2,Beware !!,"I buyed this speaker thinking in the bass ,i tought I'll gona sound good but the bass is to low I almost can't hear it,my olds speaker whit 10 years sound much better and the magnet I a little small compared whit this Pyle ,I don't know maybe I change the amplifi...I'm sad ,I'll buy better a pioneer or something better"
5,Greatest Speakers on the market,I've installed a lot of speakers in cars in the past year or 2. I like these the best for a few reasons.1. They come with the hardware to install it if you are doing a custom installation or putting them in a 6x9 speaker box (which I highly suggest you buy as well)2. They come with protective grilles.3. They come with the wiring needed so you can run em to an amplifier or just splice them with your OEM wiring.4. The sound is amazing. You got good vocals coming out as well as good bass too. It all depends on how your equalizer is set on your stereo.These are the best bang for you buck. The packaging when received was the way it should be they're double boxed. They were inside their factory box and then packed into an Amazon box with the proper padding.The shipping on these are good and its fast.I would definitely suggest these to anyone who wants a better and clearer sound as well as good bass reflex.
5,Sacred and playful.,"Bach's 'Magnificat' is one of his most famous works, its relatively familiar format - huge opening chorus, two arias, two duets and two recitatives - made exhilarating by choral writing as architecturally, accumulatively intricate as that for the instruments. Rotzsch's pacing is superb, alive to nuance and texture, but the overproduction typical of the period (1978) can make it sound distractingly artificial.Much more enjoyable is the less familiar cantata, BWV 10. Though a sacred, Marian piece, it is one of Bach's more playful, with a thrilling, layered chorus followed by a gorgeous extended soprano aria based on a Brandenburg concerto, followed by an oom-pah tenor aria with the organ boucing away like the lightest violin. And so on. A welcome surprise."
4,Decent for the money,"I bought this cat-back system for my 96 delSol and it looks nice on the car, but installing it was somewhat difficult because of the slip-on style pipe connection. I would suggest any others to first pre-fit the muffler and make sure the hangers are bent enough to not hit or contact the bumper. Other than that, sounds good...not too raspy and looks good."
5,dmc 2,I am very glad because in amazon sent me special edition with 2 discs ...I played for 3 hours the first timeprepare for play ... ps3 is the top but ps2 is good too
2,Sry but...,"Major fan of DMC 1, and was really excited to get this game with a friend, we would each pay twenty dollors, i was overjoyed when i saw it was now only twenty, i should have been suspicious...Actual review - just read this if you want toWhat made DMC 1 was Dant'es cool whoopa** moves, i don't give a s*** dioluge, and the coolet demon hunter around, with an awsome storyline t boot, if tis was the first game it would have rocked, but it unfortunatley followed the first game soDante totally lost ALL his personality, and what did he do with the demon powers he inherited in the first game, he just threw out two of the most powerful demon accesories ever?Then there was no STORY - whats that about and the lucia disk is the same exact as the Dante thing with minor differences, and she's a sucky characted, ultra sucky - maybe they combine GTA and DMC into a free exploration DMC game, as part RPG, that would rock"
2,es un asco,"es un asco de juego, no se parece para nada al primero. los enemigos son muy sin gracias, y debiles. son mas pequenos que en Devil May Cry, ademas es muy facil de terminar. Aunque permite usar dos personajes distintos, realmente no tiene sentido. este juego es una decepcion. espero que la tercera parte sea mucho mejor."
3,Good game for first timer,"I didn't play Devil May Cry 1 and decided to give DMC2 a try regardless of some poor reviews. The story is pretty good, but this game gets boring quick. It's a simple hack and slash game like Dynasty Warriors without trailing sword plays. The camera angles are horrible, one second you run to the right, the camera switches to another angle and the next thing you know you are running to the left even though you are still holding right button. Capcom could have done better by putting more puzzles and mysteries in this game like they did on Onimusha series."
2,AWSOME GAME!...,this game is awsome!...devil may cry 1 was very good.and number 2 is even better.its just the right amount of difficulty.and loads very fast.u can even buy tecneques[.]I would of gave this game even more stars if I could but it only let me put 5.this is the best game ever![.]
3,It was ook,"Well I was waiting forever for this game to come and was very dissapoited. I'm Sorry but it was more like a resident evil kind of game. The first was much better and had unique tastes, but in DMC2 it was as unique such as instead of a unique gun like Nightmare B in DMC you get a rocket launcher for me i think its like resident evil and theres some monsters that should be in resident evil. I give this game 3 stars because the FMV's(yes there are FMV's)and graphics and the matrix like moves, messing around with monsters with these kinda moves are alot of fun so the game was ook."
4,Horrible Story,"Dante was really cool in the first Devil May Cry and I think I was just so caught off guard by his cool moves that the story line didn't matter that much, that's not to say it wasn't good. Now Devil May Cry 2 Dante has better moves, example, you can jump up turn up side down and shoot at enemies beneath you, running up the wall, running across the wall, shooting behind you, doing back flips to avoid enemy attacks (The evade feature in my opinion was really cool) and the list goes on. Now I already new Dante had cool moves and since this is a sequal his moves had to be improved upon and they were but the story line sucks, basically almost all the sounds to this game don't fit. Also some camera angles in the game only allow you to see Dante shooting his gun at mysterious enemies. The game was cool and was fun to play but it could of been done way better, unlike normal awesome games that could of been improve upon but not done better."
3,"Fun, but a let down none the less","Devil May Cry was an amazing game. Devil May Cry 2 is comparitively a let down. Here are the main problems with the game:-It's Short.-It's Easy.-The Plot is Worthless.-The Weapon/Upgrade System is Worthless.-The Camera is still bad at times.-The new combo system is worthless.However, there are some redeeming points as well:-The game is fun.-Great if you just want to blast some baddies.-Bloody Palace Mode is more fun than the story.-Some cool stuff to unlock.Basically, it's not an awful game. But it isn't a great one either. If you haven't played the original, get it instead of the sequel."
3,..... : (,"I'm giving DMC2 3 stars just because I loved the first so much... It just isn't devil may cry, it has Dante and his moves but you just run around a town with out ever seeing any story and well... just isn't as fun as the first. The weapons are boring compared to the first as well. It looks like they combined Onimusha, Shinobi, and Devil May Cry to make this game.... it just didn't turn out well..."
1,Don't buy this product if you have a Motorola Razr,"I am very frustrated with Kensington on the packaging and labeling of their Power Tips and Smart Tips for Motorola mobile phones. I ordered the Smart Tip package because the picture on Amazon and the description said it contained the M16 tip--the M16 is required to charge the later model Razrs and works with older Razrs, too. I returned the product twice because what I was sent didn't contain the M16. Amazon refunded my money and said there was a bigger problem than they realized. I then ordered the USB Power Tips for Motorola Mobile Phones. The picture shows an M16 tip, but guess what, no M16 tip. Nothing in the package will charge a Razr phone. I give up."
1,Excellent show miserable video quality.,A major disapointment. Has to be the worst quality video i've ever seen. It's a nightmare alright. Too bad The Invaders was an excellent show. MM&V are rank amateurs in the video business. Save your money and don't buy this one.
3,Better than My Frequency but could be better,"Ok call me a Tech freak,but Im so used to him throwing down these killer tech/trance/breaks tracks,and the fact that he has changed his style sucks.He's a great dj but why , WHY does he continue to add filler songs that are boring as hell in his mixes.To me this totally takes away the ""magic""of the cd,and it's just another track that I program in my cd player to skip.Still recommended if ya like dance."
3,a bizarre but entertaining disc,"If you have ever seen the movie ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" with the scenes of Mike Myers reciting poetry, then you will have a pretty good idea of the kind of reading Marvin Miller gives to ""Green Eggs and Ham"" here.I bought this disc (along with ""The Cat in the Hat Songbook"") as humorous Christmas present for my wife; we are both Seuss fans. While we enjoyed the songbook, which concludes with a reading of one of our all-time favorites: ""The Sleep Book,"" this disc...and the reading of ""Green Eggs and Ham"" in particular, takes some getting used to.We have come to enjoy the disc. The rest of the pieces are read pretty straightforwardly. ""The Rabbit, the Bear and the Zinniga-Zanniga"" is probably the best reading on the disc. It is typically Seussian in that it is both funny and instructive.I recommend this disc on its sheer potential to be a conversation piece with those friends who won't think you're insane for listening to a beatnik reading of Dr. Seuss."
1,really bad,i don't know what to say bout this albulm rather than it is truly a dissapointment i was told that integrity was a great band but in fact they aren't they really have no talent what so ever.
4,Tender love story,"The heroine's secret, and the hero's reaction to it, is dramatic and very tender. Can't say too much about that particular plot twist without giving away a major spoiler. What I really liked about this story is that, having begun in the usual way for a Presents: a super rich hero, a heroine being manipulated into a marriage with him; they are both attracted but very suspicious of each other... but then the plot, due to the heroine's secret, swung into into a completely different direction and became a sweeter, more tender story. Very nice writing here from Julia James."
1,Copywritten inconvenience,"Here I sit in my DJ room typing on a computer instead of watching this CD all because it's won't play on either of my laptops. As someone who plays most of his DVDs on laptops, this is simply too much of an inconvenience. I still look forward to watching the DVDs when I get around to sitting in front of an actual TV with an actual DVD player, but I won't be recommending the series to anyone."
2,not for kids,"I completely agree with eph's review below. I would also like to add that this book is not for children. There is way too much information on artificially inseminating a pug. I'm all for openness and honestly dealing with sexual matters, but this was just plain ""icky""."
4,Reasonable support book,I purchased this as a supplement to the Onliine algebra class I'm taking. Gives some good ideas on use of the graphing calculator.
2,Fake Widescreen,"The region 2 version of this movie is a false widescreen,it is a fullscreen movie with black bars added at the top and bottom to give the apperance of a widescreen movie."
1,Appalling,Really bad. Piranhas cross with flying fish so now they fly onto the beach to eat people? Who thought this thing up? I never thought much of James Cameron as a director (The Abyss? Titanic??) and this just sealed my opinion. This movie would be prime fodder for MST 3K.
1,Quite possibly in the top two worst movies I've ever seen!,"This movie has become an on-going joke among my friends. If there is a film or book or ANYTHING that is over-the-top LAME, we can rate it ""Well, it was better than Pirahna Part II!"" The ONLY redeeming point might be one that another reviewer has made, in that it is so awful, it is almost worth watching simply as a ""funny horror flick."" I have to say that I'm surprised that Mystery Science Theater 3000 hasn't picked this one up, It's a gem!"
1,"Flat out moronic, and that's being kind!","Long before ""The Terminator"", ""Aliens"", and ""Titanic"" came along, James Cameron cranked out this unforgivably godawful turkey. A sequel to Joe Dante's far superior original, this one gives wings to the toothy little terrors as they launch an all out assault on dry land.What may have seemed a neat idea on paper just smolders onscreen like a cheap cigar. You'll find yourself laughing in a puddle of tears more often than not. At the very least, the script could have provided Lance Henriksen a stronger supporting role -- I still can't understand why he bothered with this movie. Oh well, live and learn."
2,Interesting trivia facts,"James Cameron only worked on this movie for one week before he was fired (and then replaced) by the producer, Ovidio G. Assonitis. Ovidio wasn't satisfied with James' progress, for some reason (can't imagine why). Cameron did most of the camera work, but Assonitis did the editing, cutting Cameron out of the loop (as it were). Cameron actually broke into the editing room once to try and repair the damage (to his reputation, if nothing else). Alas, he was caught...just like the fish in this movie!"
1,James Cameron Defender,"True, this movie is not very good and it does have much cheese in it but you must remember that this movie is one of his first and almost every filmaker has a flop or two so give james a brake."
3,They're Back...,"At the end of Roger Corman's film Piranha, there is the implication that some of the deadly fish could get to and survive in the ocean.Well, this is sort of the follow-up to that idea, but in this one the fish can fly! I kid you not. They are also much bigger than their predecessors (probably to make it easier for the cast to interact with the wind-up props).Lacking from this film is the original's complex plot. No secret military lab. No secret investments. No summer camp with the hero's daughter. None of it. It does have star power however. Lance Henricksen stars (and does a reasonable job) and James Cameron directs.I have to say that the original is better and has more tension. The addition of flying just went too far and pulled the plug on this one. People are scared of sharks. They are scared of piranha. They are real. Giant flying piranha are not and therefore can not build the same scare factor.Still, B-Film and creature film fans will want to watch this one."
4,PRETTY GOOD.......,I like this movie despite its lousy storyline. The concept of flying piranha eating people was pretty good and the movie has its scary moments. The piranha effect was fake but acceptable considering the movie was made more than 10 years ago. The music score was not bad. A fun watch.
1,"First waterboarding, now this",All three of these in one box? So you can watch them all at once? Good lord. Is that something the studio picked up from Guantanamo torture transcripts?
5,Downright home spun fire and brimstone,"Mary Gauthier is a prophet of country folk. She tales a dark tale of Johnny Cash spirituality and down on your luck grittiness. She is authentic and Louisianian. She is apocalypse coming to a bayou. She is real and a damn fine listen at that.The authentic life she portrays is refreshing in a neuvo biblical Revelations sort of way. Her accent isn't a put-on. She knows of stories of hard times and falls and fires. Her music is stripped down unpretentiousness. Old country pure and black.She summons ghost of Neil Young (if he were dead...God forbid), Cowboy Junkies, Nancy Apple, Roseanne Cash, Robert Earle Keene,and many many more. The songs, though sometimes painful and dark, invite repeated listens. You will get the real deal and turn heads listening this with windows rolled down, a hound dawg panting in your ear, '67 chevy truck at a stop-light in a one-horse town.Gauthier is darkness on the edge of town and harvest and oh so much in addition."
4,Great pill containers,Having been fighting Cancer for 15 years one of my most helpfull treatment are the Vitamins and supplement's I take four or five times a day. THese pill containers hold all of my regime and I can fill them once a week for 7 days of not having to open 15-20 bottles.
3,Not for the lay person,"This book is written by a professor of Theology and in my opinion is geared more toward an audience of academicians. It is not an easy read as it is very wordy - to the point of being choppy and lacking flow. I can see it being useful for students of Theology for purposes of research papers as it is filled with a wealth of information. However, this is not a book for the casual reader that is just looking to learn more about the history of the Presbyterian religion. While it provides the information you're probably looking for, it reads like a college text book. This is definitely a book for clergy and the world of academia, NOT for the lay person or casual reader."
3,Well filmed - plot drags it down,"Although the acting is, for the most part, very, very good, the main problem with this film is in the plot itself. I kept waiting for some interesting twists or turns, but no.... It was very predictable, but still quite enjoyable. The story is about a beautiful young governess who marries an older man (who happens to be the father of her student), thus becoming Lady Audley. She is (supposedly) hiding a dark and mysterious past, but that past is pretty obvious from the very beginning. The cast does a good job - particularly Juliette Caton who gives a touching and delicate performance as the unfortunate young Alicia Audley (Lady Audley's student, later to become Lady Audley's step-daughter) who perhaps suffers the most and still emerges as (arguably) the most endearing and noble character. The costumes are beautiful and the filming is lovely. Worth watching if you like period dramas - just don't expect too much mystery!"
5,KOHALA,"7/17/00 Yesterday, I returned from a weekend get away at the Kahala Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Oahua. This cd was playing in our room as we walked in. It is so soothing, relaxing and a a bit romantic. You will truly enjoy it!"
2,Hard to see through,"Lots of details on myth, but I still don't get the spirituality at all. If the author had been more on explaining this, and less on convincing the reader that human sacrifice isn't so bad and that Christianity is evil ..."
5,Dophins are forever,"Or so says one of my granddaughters.This plush dolphin is a perfect little extra gift.Soft, resilient and lifelike."
3,Not good for my needs,It was good for many audiences buy not what I needed it for. I would like a video on what simple things kids (4th) grade need to know when they are home alone. Your product is a little too long and in depth. But in worked in a pinch.
2,Mediocre guide to Italian wine - leave it in the car,"I saw the original in Italy and decided - ignoring some other not-so positive reviews - to order it.It is surely NOT 'definitive' - arneis doesn't make the 'Index of Great Wines' (!!?), and the general style is a bit...'touristy'. That said, it's a decent overview - it's nice to have the regional maps and brief descriptions. If you travel frequently in Italy by car, it's worth taking along as a guide to the wines and areas that are included, but for a truly definitive guide you need to look elsewhere."
1,This thing Sucks,when i ordered and recieved this device i thought it was of good quality till i tried to charge it then the screen started flashing and since no manual is included i didt know if that was a good thing or a bad thing now when i try to turn it on it wont.Spend a Little more money and Dont buy a look alike get the real thing
4,its ok but its not what as you see,ok well i orderd this prodect and it was not exactly what it is on the picture. its totally different as in keys but it is still what i was looking for just exactly what i was looking for. this is a perfect prodect to order if you dont want to spend 300 dollars on a ipod video. this has every thing that it has on there games.music.FM radio.videos.record your own voice and radio.pictures.system setup.text. i dont know what that is for but ill find out. but all these things are included on this devise and for about 30 bucks for a used one its not that bad at all so all the people out there who give this item a bad review dont believe them this prodect is exclent for people who dont want to spend 300 dollars on their child just for a thing that holds maybe half of the stuff that is on here. if i were you i would order this product.
4,Native American lore and legend...,"Old vendettas and native American superstitions abound in Navajo country.Ms Gentry introduces us to a cast of characters, some honorable, but most greedy and evil, who are caught up in a spiraling series of bizarre murders. The murders, eleven in all, if I counted correctly, are so diabolical and gruesome that many in Lukachwhai believe the old powers of the Skin Walkers, the evil spirits who inflict supernatural punishment on the living, are at work again.The complicated plot follows through to a sad but logical ending. If you enjoy native American lore and legend, then this book will surely please.Ms Gentry is a meticulous storyteller with a lyrical and enjoyable style.-Jonni Rich"
4,Precise and Helpful!,"A quick spur of the moment wedding that I had waiting for my entire life, this book was wonderful in setting your own themes and using creativity in a new non-traditional way. The types of weddings we choose vary and so do our tastes. I won't say this book saved my life but it did give me a more grounded reality of how I could adapt the wedding to my ""our"" tastes and also gave contact information on various venues. Very helpful."
2,Needs to be cheesier,"I had to add more cheddar to get a real natural flavor and texture. Annie's loses to Safeway's Organics according to my wife, even though it has a carroty fake cheddar color."
1,Dont fit..!,"The hard Disk doesn't fit my server, and the seller doesn't answer my replay fast. I want to return the item.! The hard dive say that fit a SCSI server, but I need a kit that mi server don't have and they don't say noting.HP SAS HARD DRIVE - 146GB - 15000RPM - 3GBPS SAS - SAS 300 - SERIAL ATTACHED SCSI - INTERNAL."
2,Like reading Nancy Drew,"When I was 11 or 12, I read a ton of Hardy Boy and similar books. They were all fun reading.I think the author is still reading them, I was waiting for good ol' Regan Reilly to ride off in her roadster."
1,"You're kidding, right?","This so-called ""book"" has got to be a joke, but I'm not laughing. Actually, I'm furious that something like this can be published simply because of who the author is, rather than what the manuscript says. Shame on the publisher for wasting a tree."
2,Make sure you have your decoder ring!,"This book is so completely disjointed and self contradictory that I thought it was ghost published by Sybex (the worst techno publisher of ALL time). I have many years of experience in the industry and I still needed several days and a secret decoder ring to decipher a few paragraphs. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with Cisco on this one!!! I would give it a one, but I do believe that if you blindly memorize with NO concern for comprehension, that this will probably limp you through passing.Anyhow, enough bashing. Just save your money and look else where.Patrick Smith MCSE, MCP+I, CCNA v1/v2, CCNP"
4,"Good book for exam and knowledge, very dry though","If you really want to know the stuff, get this cisco book. This book is certainly better than McGraw Hill book. Both books are very dry. They are hard to follow mainly because the technology presented in these books/tests are 70% outdated. People are using VPNs now and yet this test does not cover that.Bottom Line: By using only this book, you will certainly pass the test and gain indepth info.I will give it 4 star because of writing style."
3,"OK, but not enough.","If you can decode Catherine's style fo writing and understand where's she's trying to go with her points, then you'll be ready for approximately 75% of the BCRAN exam. The remaining 25% is not found in this book.... sadly this is one of the two worst CiscoPress books I've read. Luckily, CCO filled in the gaps, added to the fact that BCRAN is one of the easier CCNP/DP exams. If you want a book that tracks 100% to the BCRAN exam, try another book."
2,"Good info, just not presented well","Lots of good information in this book. Unfortunately, the info is not presented in a manner that leads to understanding the topics. Configuration examples are poor, with commands whose functions are not explained locally. I found myself having to rely on other texts. If you are hoping to pass the BCRAN from this book..good luck."
1,Can't pass the CMTD exam with this book.,"If you think you are going to get your CCNP with this book, you are mistaken. It does not cover the CMTD exam at all. This may be OK for the BCRAN course as a fill-in, but the new CMTD, which will be called Remote-Acess and not completely be based on the BCRAN material. The new BCRAN beta exam comes out in Novemeber and last through January. This means you HAVE to take the CMTD until Feburary when and if the new Remote-Access exam is avialable. Go to ebey and find a CMTD course book. That is your best bet."
5,Refreshingly real thoughts on being a mom,"We all owe our moms, but who can quantify it? Finally, we get the real answer from Betsy Howie, who is brave enough to tell it like it really is and funny enough to make the reader love agreeing with her. Having a baby in America truly is a massive consumer experience, but fortunately the author handles it all with an eye on what's really important. Take away the strollers and layettes, and what you have left is the love and caring that count. Howie is able to experience and communicate it all deeply and honestly. At points I had tears from laughing so hard, and feeling so deeply. Those who criticize her concept simply haven't read the book."
2,Two stars for chuck!,"Consider SYMBOLIC the last DEATH recording.Everything after is a lazy regression...as limiting as death metal is,it's NO excuse for LOUSY power metal w/weak vocals.I don't get it...why did great musical fortitude turn into unmusical turds?You let US down!!!US being the death metal minority whom upheld your musical flag,in the face of those non-musical [people] that couldn't see the path between ""Pull the Plug"" and "" Lack of Comprehension"" Sorry 'bout the pun!Nontheless,Your pantheon of tunes still outranks 95% of all...For that and more..."
4,Death Reformed,"This CD is great! It is a few members of the band Death along with Chuck on guitar and Tim Aymar doing the vocal duties. It has the guitar work and sound of Death. I didn't know who this band was until I picked it up and it blew my head off! This is a must for any Death fans, you won't be disappointed. Long live ""Death"""
5,I love it,I used to play on a Yamaha professional model Tenor then I just got this sax over the summer it may be a little bit heaver than most tenors but the sound quality and tone is superb. I would not recommend to get this tenor if you are going to be marching though as it can be a pain in the neck literally I use it for jazz and symphonic still have the yamaha for marching though
5,A good overview of historical professional soldiering,"There are many causes worth fighting for, but some just go without mention thanks to lack of media coverage (Biafra comes to mind). Some mercenaries do not fit the Hollywood mold of a ruthless, senseless warmonger with a thirst for blood and the next big paycheck. Some mercs are angels of mercy, sacrificing themselves for those whom it may not be ""politically suitable"" for other large nations (read: USA) to aid.""Mercs"" covers some of these individuals with interesting non-fiction short stories. Of particular interest to this reader were the accounts of Count Carl Gustav von Rosen, who led five modified light aircraft armed with small rocket pods on morning raids against the Nigerian Air Force (mostly MiGs), and the stories concerning the history of the French Foreign Legion."
4,Mercs-- A cut above the rest,"This is a highly interesting collection of stories. It covers the history of merenaries from the Greeks in Persia to the modern day drug wars. This book has a definite intellectual edge to it, as the writers clearly have a decent education. If you are used to reading military stories written by veterans with little or no education (not to say the stories are not interesting) this is a refreshing, clearly written book. I enjoyed it thouroughly, and learned many things that I found both surprising and entertaining."
4,Factory replacement/ upgrade,"I just installed these speakers in my truck. My truck is a 1987 ford f 350 lariat XLT. The doors on here are similar to the Bronco and other pickups of that generation. I started by removing the stock speakers and the corresponding hardware. I did not use the trucks wiring for the speakers or the ones provided because they are too small. I used 18 gauge (home theater wiring) and ran it to my power amp. It is an oldie but goodie. Its a Crutchfield CR-2x50 witch is about 100 RMS a channel.It was a good fit, the basket was bigger than the stock so, I lined it up and used the original self tapping screws to make new holes and mount the speaker.For sound I love them. They provide ALLOT of highs and mids and the bass is really good. I would recommend an EQ and using a larger but not obnoxious wire. I am waiting on a subwoofer to finish off the system.All in all these speakers are great for someone om a budget. They also shipped fast too."
2,Great Product but Piss Poor Condition,I have intended to buy this set all along when it came available and the 50% deal was a steal I thought. Like my title says the product ie show is great but the condition in which it arrived was terrable.Instead of receiving a 5 box set I received a 4 box set with season 4 being a slim edition while all others are the regular size.The shipping box came with out any visible damage while 2 of the angel series inside had the boxes bent and crumpled as well as having plastic holders broken with 2 dvds scratched and the cases messed up.I will now be attempting the return policy and see if amazon can get me the correct box set for season 4 and replace the 2 broken cases and scratched dvds.
5,ANGEL: HEIR TO THE BUFFY LEGACY,"I ENJOYED THE ANGEL COLLECTORS DISKS. IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL CONTINUATION OF THE JOSS WHEDDON BUFFY SERIES IN STYLE. I'VE JUST PLAYED THE DISKS FOR A SECOND TIME AND ENJOYED THEM EVEN MORE. I'M THINKING OF REPLAYING THE BUFFY DISKS FEATURING ANGEL I CURRENTLY WATCH THE TV SHOW ""BONES"" STARRING DAVID BOREANAZ."
5,One of the best Series of all Time,"There's not a lot to say about this show that can't be summed up simply by telling you to watch it. With the abundance of crap coming out of the airwaves, if you're as sick of bastardized entertainment like American Idol or sub-par narrative and hack writing like Smallville, then you owe it to yourself to see Angel. You also owe it to yourself to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, two of Joss Whedon's other television products.You'll never care more about the characters of a TV series than you will the characters of Angel."
5,David Boreanaz Fan,"The Angel Collection Set is one of the finest collectible items I have ever seen. It has a beautifully designed outer box with beautifully designed inner DVD boxes for each of the five seasons. You also receive a booklet listing each episode in each season. This product makes such a nice display it could be left of the coffee table. It is well worth the price; and, of course, David Boreanaz is an added bonus."
2,Only lasted 7 months,I purchased this in Dec. 2010. Haven't used it much. maybe once a week. It stopped working. didn't even last a year. Don't buy this. it was good while it lasted. I tried circuit breaker in two different bathrooms. don't know what the problem was. oh well. my loss.[...]
3,Vidal Sasson VS784 Ionic Travel dryer,"It's a bit big for a compact travel dryer. The low setting is too low, not enough power."
1,Only worked 3 times !!!,"I purchased this dual voltage hair dryer to use on my trip to Asia. It worked like a charm the first three times. The fourth time it began emmitting a buzzing sound and smoke started coming out. Had to throw it away because I would've returned past the 30 days warranty period and did not want to deal with shipping back and forth with the manufacturer. If you intend to use in Asia, do not buy."
1,Do Not Buy This Dryer,"This used to be an OK dryer. But 4 months ago, I purchased one from Amazon that burned out in 3 days. The replacement I received has just burned out after 4 months. I has a one year ""joke"" warranty, which means you can return it only during the first 30 days. After that, you have to mail it to the company along with a $5 check for ""handling."" It would cost more than 50% of the price to avail yourself of this warranty. When this thing burns up, expect a fireworks show. It's a shoddy and dangerous product."
1,"Bought it in March, it died in June","I was very pleased with this blow dryer until I turned it on and it sparked, a puff of white smoke came out of the back vent and it died. Not good. Returned it."
2,This blow dryer was defective - twice!,"I had one of these for 2 years and liked it. Functioned as promised but it frizzled out on me after two years (smoke and sudden loud noises). Since I liked the funcitonality, I bought a second one. It went belly-up in less than three days (smoke and a clanking sound this time). Too bad, but it obviously has design flaws."
3,celtic bracelet.,"this very nice bracelet has become my ""go with everything"" bracelet.it fits loosely on the wrist so it's very easy to hook and unhook without asking for help! yep, i like it. :)"
5,Great presentation,"The second animusic dvd is better than the first with amazing visuals and top notch audio. Both together make a great collection, just waiting for number three!"
4,Encore!,"Sequels are rough.We want more of something we loved. And yet we want it to be different and to reflect growth.In this case, those who craved something beyond the first Animusic album would want new, engaging MIDI music and special effects programmed to illustrate it. What we get are songs which are (openly or not so openly) derivative of the first album, and graphics which extend the reach of the concepts created for the first volume. It actually works pretty well, but if the viewer expects ""breakthrough"" experiences, as was the case with the first album, he is bound for some disappointment.Overall, it made me want to see Animusic 3. Now, if someone would just tell me where to find it...P.S. - I really liked the robots - reminded me of the ""Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots"" when I was a kid."
5,Animusic,"I purchased both videos and absolutely love them. I am looking forward to more of this kind of video. The music is great, the color and animation is a delight to watch. Very clever, some clips are really brilliant. If you like color and sound and animation, this is a must for you."
5,Great book - full of a lifetime of wisdom !,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Each page is packed with words of wisdom from a senior doctor, who has seen it all - and is willing to share what he has learned ! I'd recommend this book to all medical students and residents !"
1,BEWARE: You MUST have special PRINTER INK + checks,I didn't realize this and my printer doesn't a magnetic ink cartridge so I just wasted my money on the checks! A certificate did come in the box to get the software for free but it's no good without the ink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Check for the ink first! (do a search for magnetic ink)
4,Printable Checks,Blank checks great to print for personal and business accounts. Just wish they cam in smaller amounts.
3,Good for ND Fans,"If you're a die-hard Notre Dame fan, then you'd love this book. For anyone else, it may be kind of boring."
4,"Feel good, but a little too light","This very light read on Richard Branson's outlook in life and business is a must read for people who want to know how positively one of the biggest business figures out there think. Although the book could be a tad *too* light, it's main treatise -- that having fun in life is the most important thing you could yearn for -- only makes sense if you read through his definition of fun.Highly recommended for those who want to read books in one sitting -- now I look forward to readingLosing My Virginity: How I Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way."
5,Let's do it!,"One part autobiography, one part self-help book, Screw It, Let's Do It is a fast, fun and easy read. Branson is a fascinating character who writes in plain English. He emphasizes the importance of fun, friends and family over non-stop work - yet he recognizes the value of a dollar (and what it takes to earn one.) Read it for enjoyment or inspiration."
3,Not bad...,"A little low on substance. I wouldn't exactly call it ""lessons in life"", but maybe ""some stuff I've picked up along the way... and I like balloons!"" It is a quick and encouraging read, though, from a fascinating character! Would love to read the same book with a lot more substance."
4,Short and sweet,A short book given I suppose you could call it motivation and advice on how Richard Branson's way on life and business. Good for something basic if you really want something more indepth then try Losing my Virginity
3,for real Starman fans - Times Past stories,"outside the usual Startman continuity, these stories are set in different times and places, using some of the familiar Immortal characters and either commenting on, foreshadowing or further explaining some of the intricacies of the Starman plot-line. For fans who have already read the series, it is a treat. Not recommended as the introduction to the series, however."
1,underwhelmed,"I bought this book and it went straight to the give-away pile in the basement. I'm not sure what I expected, but the recipes didn't even look good to me. If I'm still going to have to prepare sides, then I might was cook the entree, too. I'm going back to using my Crock Pot for soups and chili only."
4,Excellent Brazilian folk album,"Maguinha has been playing Brazilian music of various kinds for years and years, but only recently started recording. This album is a selection of folk songs that are very well known in Brazil, but not nearly as well known outside of Brazil. It's really Maguinha's attempt to bring the musical culture she grew up with to a wider audience, so the songs you hear here are everyday songs from Brazil.Prior to hearing this album I was not familiar with Brazilian music, and I was surprised by how much I liked it. The songs all have strong melodies, many also feature interesting rhythms, and the band does more than just back Maguinha singing. The liner notes include the song lyrics in both Portuguese and English, which helps you understand what the songs are about. Highly recommended!"
1,"Slim, sexy fit= size TWO X!!!!","Slim, sexy fit, but isn't specific about that being on a 2x woman. Sizing was sketchy, I went on the hope that the description..slim..sexy..petite..runs small, etc...was accurate. They sent a 2x. Total waste of money."
3,Not convenient for air travel,"Bought this bag right before a week long business trip and mainly because I liked all the compartments it had to organize your computer and files etc...I also needed something I could move easily through airports. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the airport the pull up handle had broken. I tried to fix it but it looked like a bolt inside the bag that holds it in place came off or snapped. I could get it to stay in place so I could at least roll it if I was careful but spent most of my time lugging it by the straps. Also, it is too large to roll down the aisle or go under the seat when flying. So if I wanted to work on a long flight I have to separate what I was working on from the bag and hoist the bag up into the storage bins on the plane."
3,It came shipped with a bad zipper!!!,"I got this bag as a gift from my parents. It does it job, but it came with a barely functioning front zipper. I tried every possible way to zip it up. Also, the handle's chinsy and feels like it's going to break. If I had to choose another bag, this would not be the one."
1,NOT as pictured,"This was ordered specifically because there was yellow inside shown in the pictures. There is NO color inside besides black. VERY disappointed as this was a gift. If you are expecting or wanting color inside, DO NOT ORDER!"
1,Telescoping handle failed on 2nd trip,"The bag is ok, but the telescoping handle failed on the 2nd business trip. It is very difficult (impossible) to put a bag with an extended handle into the overhead storage of an airplane. I would like to simply disable the locking mechanism entirely, but the construction is riveted and cannot be disassembled. Service life of this bag was less than one month, 1.5 business trips."
4,Good bag for its price,"The bag arrived very quickly and I already had 4 trips with it, all is all did its job wellIf you like me use another bag like for a laptop, to put on top of the bag you should know that it will leave a little ""dent"" on the top of the roller... it's a bit smaller than I wanted it to be"
4,"17"" Laptop Computer Bag","Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the Notebook Bag. I did not buy it for travel, but for school and to carry my 17"" Notebook. It does fit the Notebook very well but there are pockets for the accessories and the fit is too tight so I can't really put anything else in the compartment with the computer. The front space has a lot of organizing pockets but again there is not a lot of width so you can't put too much in it. I don't see how this could be used for travel unless you travel awfully light. I use that compartment for a couple of my binders and a book. That's all that will fit. You may be able to stuff more things in but I don't like to overpack or cause anything to break inside. Overall, for my purpose, it works out fine. It fits the larger Notebook and has padding to protect it. It also holds the books and supplies I need for school and doesn't put of strain on my back like a backpack."
5,"creative, talented, entertaining","This is Fiction is a great album. This is an exciting new band! ""I Could Cry"" is a great display of their talent and creativity. The music is never boring - a great listen!"
2,Digital Quality,Great TV series. I was forced to give it such a low review due to DVD image quality. very very poor.
5,24-seasons 1-4,Excellent quality and organization of episodes. No complaints. Missed the first four years of this show and am thoroughly enjoying it now.
2,There is better (pre/post) Holocaust fiction out there,"This is my first Oates book to read. She is a talented writer -- clever, metophorical, and she does know how to develop characters. However, there are better books out there that are not sterotypical ""Holocaust"" fiction -- even if it is post-Holocaust fiction. For a good,accurate, distrubing,and thought provoking read try Blood From the Sky, Mendelssohn is on the Roof, The Painted Bird, or even Ida Fink's The Journey. If you are going to read Holocaust Fiction (even if it set in modern times) read something worthwhile."
1,I COULDNT PLAY THE JIMMY SCOTT DVD BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE PAL FORMAT,I COULDNT PLAY THIS DVD ON MY DVD PLAYERBECAUSE I RECEIVED A BLOCKER MESSAGE FROM THE DVD DISC ON MY DVD PLAYER THAT SAID I WAS NOT IN THE RIGHT REGION . I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS FOR MY MONEY. I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS RECORDED IN PAL.I THINK THIS MAKES JIMMY SCOTTS CAREER LOOK LIKE IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS OUTSIDE OF nEW yoRK cITY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HIM AND HE SEEMS TO BE DOING MOST OF HIS SINGING IN THE PAL REGION IN EUROPE OR BRAZIL.
3,Ascot & Hopetown,"Bruce Brown's videography of the racing at Ascot Park and Bob Hope's property in Simi Valley is a historical look at dirt track racing and the origins of motocross in America. SoCal was home for many future World Champions of all disciplines of motorcycle racing. This video has Wide World of Sports footage, as well as Bruce's own film stock.The production quality isn't the best. It ain't On Any Sunday or The Endless Summer. It is a fun look back at some of the greats and how important racing was to people like me who grew up in that magical time and place."
4,"Lucid articles, broad selection of articles on safety topics","Aviation Safety, another fine monthly from Belvoir publications, focuses on a variety of safe piloting topics. Where NTSB Reporter dwells on meticulous post mortems, A.S. may cover an accident then spend a lot of text suggesting how you could develop the appropriate technique beyond the theory you learned from your CFI.For example, most aviators are familiar with the ""demonstrated crosswind component"" in the pilot operating handbook. It's not a limiting factor, just what the plane was tested against. Aviation Safety might have an article explaining how to develop your piloting technique so if you were faced with a stronger crosswind, you could operate in a less forgiving zone of performance. (After practice, I employed this during a 30 knot crosswind at Billings, MT)Like IFR, it's refreshing (pun intended) because they'll call a stupid procedure a stupid procedure. You won't find pretty pictures of airplanes, but you will learn a lot."
3,Old School,"I bought the album for $5 at a Verve Pipe concert, and frankly, I expected a ""Villains"" kind of sound. Overall, it's a little more mellow (not like ""The Verve Pipe"" mellow), but the lyrics still have a rock edge. And like always the poetic lyrics are really a treat. They start picking up their more mainstream sound in ""Pop Smear,"" so this pre-mainstream album is really sweet. Worth checking out if nothing else!"
5,High Quality Cables,"If you spend your hard-earned money for quality audio-visual equipment (A/V Receivers, DVD players, etc.), you need quality cables to hook all the system components together. For many years there was one major player in the market but their cables sold for monster prices. However, Belkin came out with a premium audio-visual cable line, PureAV. I've spent a lot of time comparing these to that other major brand and am convinced the PureAV line provides a high quality product at an affordable price. My A/V components are connected to my 1080p LCD TV with PureAV cables, including HDMI, component video, and audio cables. Considering the tangle of cables behind my set, I feel confident that these cables are also well shielded from electro-magnetic interference. Quality construction and an affordable price set these cables apart and should be on your short list when connecting your audio/visual equipment together!"
4,Works as specified,"It has worked without issues for over a year. A good quality, reliable product. I would purchase another if needed."
5,Best Show on TV,"Gritty, fast paced and riveting. No show handles the Anti-Hero better, except for maybe The Sopranos. The entire show has a documentary feel and you never feel like you are watching overproduced theater like you do with CSI. The story lines are realistic and the characters act like the characters you grow to hate/love.completely worth the money"
4,Select Oldies,"This CD met my expectations. It contained a number of individual recordings that were unfamilar to me but were delightful discoveries. I was also not disappointed by the specific selection that had attracted me to the recording in the first instance.If one is looking for ""Old School"" music that is a little bit off the beaten track I would recommend this CD."
1,Not happy!,I ordered the 2006 Christmas book. I received the 2000 book. I was told it shipped the day after I ordered it and did not receive it until yesterday.
2,Disappointed,I'm an avid quilter and love many of the quilts offered by Lynette Jensen. I had seen her on TV and she displayed the very quilt on the cover of the book. I ordered the book for the pattern and was very dismayed when I got the book that it didn't contain the pattern. I'm very disappointed that many of the items featured in her book didn't have patterns to go with them. In the back of the book what how to order them making me feel as if I purchased a catalog more than anything. The craft projects she did feature I found most to be generic.The book is decent for decorating and a few craft ideas but don't buy the book thinking you can making everything in it without buying more books or patterns.
2,Season 2 not as good as season 1,I loved season one. They must have changed directors or something in season two. Season one made you feel like you were working the shift with the actors. Season two has too much camera drama. Whoever took over for season two really changed this programs feel. No wonder it never made it to a third season.
1,Nonsense,Suffers from a lack of imagination. The characters are just that; characters. It would be predictable if one spent the effort. After watching three episodes I grew tired of the whole premise. There are a few laughs but I really wish I hadn't spent the money.
5,Amazing!,"Easily the best show on Television (keep it on!). Funny, smart and unique - A fan couldn't ask for more. It's a tough sell to some people, but connects to different people in different ways. For some it's the overall absurdity of the characters and their flagrant dysfunctionality, for other's it's the surprising humanity which lies under all that absurdity.This show needs to be admired for it's quality and substance which is unrivaled by anything else on television."
5,Why can't all tv be this good??,"In Australia, they hide this little gem very late at night, usually around midnight (that same time they hide the likes of Six Feet Under and Curb Your Enthusiasm). If they showed this stuff in prime time, far too many people would see how good this is, and thereby, realise the poor quality of the rest of tv.I stumbled across this by mistake. What a stroke of luck. It's brilliant! If you appreciate great writing, bizarre characters, great acting (Jason Bateman and the hilarious Jeffrey Tambor), you'll never look back.Series 2 - Bring. It. On."
5,Incredible,"This show is simply amazing.Season 2 is the best, by far, but Season 1 is a must if you want the entire AD experience.I recommend this show wholeheartedly."
5,Best show ever,So smart and funny. That's real comedy. The way they match one episode with the next one is just amazing. Hilarious!
5,Plenty of Dirty Laughs. Not Some Highbrow Comedy!,"If you like Seinfeld of Family Guy, then you will love Arrested Developement. The show falls somewhere in the middle probably closer to Family Guy.Many people think this show is overly intellectual with snobby humor. Well, it isn't! THIS SHOW IS NOT ANOTHER FRASIER! There are plenty of dirty jokes and distasteful humor packed in each episode. One of my favriotes episodes of season 1 is Peer Pressure, where Buster gets George Michael to buy maryjane for his girlfriend Lucille. I also love Growing Up Buster and My Mother,the Car.In one of the 2 star reviews featured on Amazon, the reviewer mentioned that the main characetr's son is named George Michael and to him that wasn't very funny. However, this person obviously has not watched the show because that is very rarely ever mentioned on the show. The types of jokes made are about freeloading, sexual disfunction, prison time, alcoholism, and general family disfunction to name a few."
4,Arrested Development,"I had put off watching this show for forever, but Will Arnett has kind of grown on me through 30 Rock, so I thought I would give it a shot. The show is sitcommy, but not too canned/cliched. The dialogue is funny but not spectacular - it mostly serves to give the characters personality rather than develop any in-depth plot points. I really enjoyed it, but mostly because there isn't anything else worth watching at the moment."
5,The best show since Seinfeld,"When Seinfeld ended I always thought there would never be a show that could top it. Well Arrested Devolopment is as good, or better than Seinfeld. It is so funny. I can't see how anyone could not love it!"
3,OK,Just a time filler when I work out. Don't reall like any of the characters. Often stupid reather than funny.
3,"Smart, but a downer","I watched the first 2 episodes and half the third. I realize in the views of AD's thousands of rabid fans, that doesn't qualify me to have an opinion. But in case there is anyone out there who's still on the fence about it, here's my take:The writing is smart. The setup is intriguing and amusing. Jason Bateman and Michael Cera are appealing. A few of the other characters are fun to watch. But on the whole, I don't enjoy shows where almost none of the characters are appealing personalities and nothing good ever happens. The whole point (at least in the first few episodes) seemed to be that things would go from bad to worse, no one else in the family could be trusted to behave like a rational adult, and poor Michael and/or George Michael would be left holding the bag, every time. I don't get that much enjoyment from watching other people's misery, even if it's meant to be humorous."
5,Interesting and Useful Book,The book came in excellent shape. The information was detailed on a very wide number of areas. Provided optional treatments or care. Will be a book to refer to often.
5,I love having this book to help me care for my baby,"I'm currenty building a homeopathic home kit using the recommendations in the book. For each ailment, it tells you different approaches and what your doctor will probably reccomend for it, then you can judge what you think is best for your child. I absolutely love this book and love the straight forward explanations of alternative and conventional treatments. So far, I have managed to avoid antibiotics by using a garlic and oil tincture in my sons ear, and I am currently studying the nutrition section. Next I want to hit the acupressure sections and learn more in this area. I am so thankful to have this book - it's a must have."
4,Great Reference,"I'm not a cat person. However, I rescued a kitten a few years ago, and since my Golden Retriever couldn't ""live without him"", we kept him. I had no idea what he was. Someone mentioned ""Maine Coon"" to me, and I did an Amazon search. Who would have thought that ""our cat"" would have been on the cover of this book? The book is a bit out-dated, but none the less a great reference tool. I learned a lot by reading it, and would recommend this purchase to anyone wanting or needing information on Maine Coon Cats."
4,Far-ranging and persuasive,"Will Rogers's oft-quoted phrase ""the best Congress money can buy"" seems particularly apt after reading this study of corporate political action committees (PACs) and their influence in Washington. Unlike so many polemics against the abuses of government, however, this book is sober, comprehensive, well-researched, and -- amazingly -- told in large part in the words of PAC directors themselves. Based on extensive interviews (all quoted anonymously, of course), the book provides a fascinating, behind-the-scenes glimpse of how PACs work, what they seek to gain from their contributions, and how they lobby their ""special"" interests. (scottlondon.com for a full review)"
2,Not a fan,"Abby is spunky and loving and a mother we all wish we had. I really enjoyed getting to know the characters, especially the family. Unfortunately that is where the ""like"" about this book ends. I was a bit disappointed at the abruptness of the ending especially having so many loose ends left. The whole point of this story was that Dylan was there to write a book, yet the story ends with no book. Being left with nothing by the mother in law, seems to be that should have been resolved as well, especially for the children. I don't see the second book in my future."
4,A Holy Grail has finally been released!,"Anne Margret in a pool with her clothes on; what more can I say! Like many Anne Margret fans this film has long been a holy grail for me. It revolves around a former Navy man (Parks) who returns to his small town many years after he left. There he meets his former High School flame (Margret) the local sex kitten who in the interim has married the local Millionaire. She works her whiles on him culminating in the afore mentioned fully clothed dip in the pool to seduce him. While not a timeless classic along the lines of say PICNIC, or RAINTREE COUNTY, the film is still mildly entertaining, and has long been high on the wish lists of fans to be released on video."
5,Excellent EDC,"I love this knife. I've had it for over a year, after literally a decade of pining for it. It's just quality. I carry it every day, and it's still in great condition. It's showing a little wear on the blacking on the pocket clip, but other than that, perfect. I have the 154CM blade-steel version, and it is fantastic. It came super sharp, stays that way for a long time, and is a cinch to make that way again. I can't say enough good things about this knife. Do yourself a favor, and don't wait as long as I did to pony up and buy one (but don't pay over $75! I got mine for $63)."
5,Great knife,"This knife is perfect. Great for EDC and everything functions perfect, no blade play, locks tight, sharp, light, and AXIS assist is a bonus. Shipped very fast and its a reasonable price. I would recommend getting one."
3,More Background Needed,The author does a good job of describing the British effort. I would have liked a more detailed review of the political and social situation that brought the country into the civil war. I also think more could have been done to develop the overall desperate state that the whole country fell into. I would look at this book as a good start to finding out more about the conflict but not the only book one would want to read.
3,Good Rebind,I bought this bible for the purpose of rebinding it (it does have a sewn binding). The text is small but readable. The main problem with this bible in its original state is that the cover is very stiff which makes this bible prefer to stay closed. I wanted a leather cover that would make the bible a pleasure to hold and read. I had mine rebound by Leonard's Book Restoration ([...]/). They did an excellent job. It lays nice and flat now and I can slip it in my coat pocket with ease.
4,"Trutone covers, a great inexpensive option","I purchased the ESV thinline edition. The print is small but I love the cover. My particular edition is charcoal gray with a celtic cross etched into the cover. The ""Tru-tone"" cover is otherwise known as coagulated polyurethane. It looks good and feels good and is quite inexpensive. I'm hoping it will endure.Leather has become so expensive and I detest bonded leather because of the way it looks and the way it feels. World Publishing is releasing a series of KJV's in a similar cover. I detested having anything stamped on the cover of a leather Bible but the designs of these new covers are quite pleasing."
2,Cute but too small,okay so i wanted a cute bible and i wanted the ESV version but this bible is too small. I was very disappointed!
2,Deceiving Title,"I bought these very adorable mugs thinking I was getting a true Royal Worcester classy product. Oddly enough, on the box it came in said ""Royal Worcester by Clare Mackie"", but the bottom said, ""Made in China"". The box only says it, but not the mug itself. You decide. The description on the site does not state where is was made. They let people assume it is made in England. I did not test it for lead yet. Rather disappointed."
2,He needs some cheese with his whine,Would someone please hook up the girl that dumped him with the guy that dumped Alanis Morrisette and everyone can shut up and the rest of us can live happily ever after!!
1,ehh.,"The bass in cantata 140 is really terrible. He is far too literal, there is no legato in his line. It's Bach; that does not mean that you should rail on every single note exactly the same and have no inflection in the line."
2,Positively awful tasting,"No matter what I do to this stuff, it tastes terrible. I've shaken, stirred and blended all with the same results. It turns into a gelatinous goo that is very difficult to choke down. I am sure the nutrients in it are sound and it is very healthy but I cannot get past the taste. Usually chocolate powders are good at masking the unpleasantness of protein powder but this one misses the mark big time. It could be because it is sweetened with stevia which is not comparable to sugar. I also can barely taste the chocolate in it. For me it was a complete waste of money. There is no way I can drink this stuff."
4,Like everything about this protein powder except the package.,I really like the taste of this protein powder; the only negative I have is the package. Since it comes in a small package everytime you put your hand in to scoop out the powder it makes a mess all over the counter; which is also wasting product. The product is good but if maybe it was in a canister there would not be so much waste and mess. This is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars; the protein powder is too expensive to waste.
3,Nice book but I already have it,under a different ISBN number with the title The History and Evolution of Sailing Yachts which is a much larger coffee table sized book however containing in every other respect the same book. In fact the book that arrived in the mail does not even have the :From Technique to Adventure in its title anywhere - it is called the same thing as the book I already owned which is a bummer because I was really looking forward to a new book by this author. Now I have to return it. What a mess.
4,Floating Fun,This product is great if you're looking for some bathtime fun. My kids love to play with these blocks...its a nice change from the typical squirt bath toys or bath toys that stick to the walls. The material its made out of is ok as long as your baby doesn't chew off a chunk but it pretty durable. It also comes with a convenient mesh bag so storage is easy.
3,didn't keep long,i bought these because my son already loved building with blocks. he had a lot of fun with these the few times he used them. a few times he put them in his mouth and bit off the corners (he was about 15-18 months old) so they are not sturdy in that regard. they got slimy and mildewy rather fast and i put them in the washing machine to clean them but it didn't work so well as they are made to float lolso i ended up throwing them away b/c they just got gross too fast.
1,Reads like a bad college thesis,"This book was not written by a native English speaker, and wasn't even proofread by a native English speaker. Did not even finish the book because the writing was so bad. Reasons and conclusions reached are simplistic as well. For example: ""It is amazing that Chinese had the great idea incepted early in the era of Dar-Yu."" Furthermore, as a reader who is not a native Chinese, I found it hard to put everything in context.The book was put out by 1st books library, an online library that is print on demand. I have had one other print on demand book and the printing of illustations and photos is not up to snuff--as if the laser printers had very low dpi's. Anyhow, the diagrams in this book were lousy, badly copied from other sources and not helpful or well-captioned."
2,same like every other nail strenghtening product,"Been using it for over a week and do not see any difference compared to any other sally hansen productsthat promise to harden the nails and make them grow. Overall Sally Hansen has good products , but am not sure if this is worth the money compared to her other products that you can just pick up at the local CVS etc"
3,Student Solution Manual,"This book should be accompanied by a student solution manual, with full solutions to every odd question. Is frustating not being able to do some of the proofs."
1,weak !,"anybody who likes chamillionare is trippin'. his flows are weak and his lyrics are weaker. come on ""bullet proof vest on my chest so i won't get shot by cupid"". is he still in kindergarten cause his flows sound like he's on a playground. paul wall is ok but he should stick to his day job makin' grillz. chamillionare needs to take his iced chain and melt it into a pacifier cause he's still an infant in da game."
2,It was just OKAY,"Disturbing the Peace is about Sarah, a smart, talented and funny teacher who is less than satisfied with her life. She has a career that she loves and a man she's like to get to get to know better but she needs to put the past behind her and the only way she can do this is by meeting the birth mother who gave her up for adoption. And so begins the story....I found this book just okay. It's a quick read and entertaining with the main character (Sarah) being very likeable BUT I think the reason this book fell short is becuase it tried to take a complicated subject matter and turn it into a ""feel good"" fiction story."
3,"grand funk, power rock at its finest.","Grand funk railroad invented power, arena rock.I have seen them live 5 times since 1971.I grew up in the same hometown as the guys,in fact I went to the same schools as mark farner.I beleive I am some what of an expert on this power trio.Put on the cd and put yourself in Detroits Joe Louis Arena, for the show of your life !"
1,Small But Needs Improvement,"This arrived with a crankset that was not installed properly and the lack of any gearing really limits its utility. Fortunately, I am intending to use it as an extra bike in a basically flat coastal community and I am handy enough to (I think) fix the crankset. Don't expect much in terms of quality and performance and you won't be disappointed. But if you want a REAL folding bicycle (at a comparable price), go for a Dahon (I have one of them too)."
3,WILL THE REAL PAUL THORN PLEASE STAND UP,"Being an avid PT fan my first knee jerk reaction to ""Are You With Me"" wasn't real enthusiastic. I have no objection to artists expanding their horizons, but so much of what Paul Thorn is great at was left out. His intricate & humorous lyrics in previous efforts, are replaced by common, run-of-the-mill pop rhymes. You still hear good, raspy vocals & pleasant harmonies, but it's not enough to overcome my disappointment. I may be being too tough after listening to ""Are You With Me"" only once, but I'm hoping it will grow on me since Thorn is such a talent. If you are a Paul Thorn fan, do yourself a favor and listen to this before you buy it."
3,call 1-900- I've been let down,"""Fabio and Liberace"" may be groovin in a leopard skin thong to tracks 4-6, but the rest of the cd is lacking. I do think PT has given me ""a lot of good reasons"" to love his artistry but honestly, I feel like ""blue stew"" because in the past, Paul has given me ""a lot of good reasons to come back around"" again and again to his music; not so this time.Maybe it's just a bump in the road or a mountain he needs to climb. So dont worry Paul, I've gotta ""heart with four wheel drive"" and I'm stickin by ya. If PT reads all of these reviews, ""I bet he knows"" he is getting a ""sure sign"" that he needs to put some meat back on the bones of his lyrics. They are starting to sound redundant. Do me a favor PT, call 1-900-Ruby Ann and get some advice. ""That's all I know right now"". Love you Paul."
4,A small step back for Opeth,Please read this review with the understanding that Opeth is my favourite band of all time and that I greatly admire Porcupine Tree and Steve Wilson's work as a musician and producer. BUT......... As a huge fan of the brutality as well as the beauty in Still Life i find Blackwater Park a little too watered down for my tastes. The first three songs flow really well and make (along with the title track) the album a 4 stars. Somewhere in the middle it gets very acoustic heavy. And the bonus songs are great but are lacking in the acoustic brilliance that usually is Opeth. Still great but not my favourite.
1,Not compatible with Ipod Touch 3rd Generation,It is a nice external power unit but I had bought it for my Ipod Touch 3rd generation--unfortunately it is incompatible with it. Works fine with my normal Ipod for which I do not need it.
2,Hmmm,Funny that people like this product. I felt that this product was a wast of money. It will barely charge my phone one time and you have to remember to keep plugging it in every few days or it looses its charge by sitting unused. It sits now in my glove box never to be used again.
3,Had to stop using due to reflux,"My daughter had such bad reflux that she would choke any time she ate. At about 3 months I switched to the level 2 nipples and she started choking more. She will be 5 months next week and she is still on level 1. She chokes much much less than she used to so I may try them again, but not for a while. If your baby has reflux and chokes while eating, don't switch! I wish they made premie nipples for the wide neck bottles, I've heard they help a lot with choking issues due to reflux. My daughter wouldn't take the narrow bottle."
2,El título engaña,"En realidad, esta no es una colección de grandes éxitos de La Ley, sino más bien una reedición de sus primeros temas, los más desconocidos.Si buscas un CD de grandes éxitos, aquí no lo vas a encontrar. Si por el contrario, quieres escuchar a la banda en sus orígenes, diste en el clavo."
1,not worth a penny,"this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the plot is dumb, the acting bad. the whole movie has no point. if you watch it u have just wasted a few hrs of your life."
1,Mind-numbing repetition of scenes makes you fast forward,"The ""vantage points"" of each witness to the attempted assassination and subsequent kidnapping of the President of the United States is really annoying. Forest Whitaker's dumba** character could has been eliminated (yeah, like a fumbling guy like him could really run that fast - laughable). The really stupid ending of Dennis Quaid chasing the bad guys who kidnap the President was long and arduous. The chase is not in any way shape or form in the classic car chases of ""Bullitt,"" ""The Seven-Ups"" or ""Ronin"" The chase went on for what seemed like miles from the explosion(s) leaves you wondering why people were still running in in panic on the streets miles away(?) Poor direction and the aforementioned repetitious scenes rate this lower than low."
2,"OK, but not really worth the time",Suppose you were a former member of the Spanish special forces and terrorists had kidnapped your brother. Would you shoot 15 secret service agents one-by-one and kidnap the president of the US to get your brother back? Would you murder 15 innocent people to save your brother? Makes no sense right? That's the plot of this movie.
2,WHY DO IT?,"The flashback redo from another point of view sometimes works good, if it is not overdone, like it was in this movie. Sigourney Weaver gives a very convincing performance as a news producer. When the reporter was knocked to the ground and appeared to maybe be dead, who was filming her for the news? Isn't there some point where the camera man must put the camera down and help out? This would have been a great movie had they simply did the thing with a plot and subplot in a chronological sequence, focusing on the character of the secret service agent, rather than play ""Groundhog's Day"" with it. Dennis Quaid? That was the best they could get? The flashback redo sequence served no real purpose. This would have been an even better film if a rouge Jason Bourne was the guy who came in and saved the President and then slipped out."
5,See-Saw on a Merry-Go-Round,"Dennis Quaid is the star.Forest Whitaker steals the show.William Hurt continues to amaze.Sigourney Weaver borders on the...well, whatever.Bruce McGill does a great cameo.This action thriller reverberates with drama and melodrama while keeping the audience poised for a terrific finale.Truthfully, considering the rejenerative storyline, everything fits into place. There are no loose strings. Nothing to limit viewer enjoyment.A worthwhile trip.Get on board.Don't miss it."
2,Barely Watchable,"I just thought this was a terrible movie. It was incredibly predictable and cliche'd. The plot line didn't make much sense. Seeing the same events play out over and over again started to get boring. They seemed to be trying to get a sort of ""24"" type of tension going with a ticking clock, but it didn't work. I would skip it."
1,Just boring!!!,I have really enjoyed Amelia Grey's other books but this one just did not have enough story to keep me interested. It was a constant repetition just to fill the pages and the story was so boring that I cannot tell you how frustrated reading the part where she stole the Earl's horse over and over again all through the whole book! I tried very hard to work my way through this book but finally went to the last 15 pages and was glad when it was over!
5,Parent's Must Have!!!,"These bottles are wonderful. We had our first child in August of this year and once we started bottle feeding her we both noticed that she had less gas and did not need to be burped as much. Just recently we started including cereal in her formula and the bottles have proven to work just as well for that purpose. You will need to order the 'Y-Cut' nipples for this purpose, however, they are not very expensive at all. I would highly recommend this product to all new and experienced parents. I am so glad that I found these and you will be too..."
5,Best Bottles Money Can Buy!,"These bottles are the best thing I have ever spent my money on! They work miracles!! After switching from breast milk to formula, my child would have colic with the Avent bottles. My friend told me about these bottles because she used it with her child that had bad colic. In the first feeding, I saw the difference. Never again did she cry from colic after that. I would recommend them to everyone! They also have Y cut nipples if you want to add cereal to the milk. Try them, you will LOVE them!"
3,Cant tell the difference!,I bought this product thinking that my baby wont have colic... but honestly i cant tell the difference.. he's still colicky... I changed formula and it worked somehow... since i already bought the bottles i might as well use it... and i tell you cleaning them take such a long time compare to regular bottles... but i guess if you also have a colicky baby you can still try... babies differ from one to another....
4,Best bottles for gas prevention,"After having tried every bottle brand we could find, we ended up preferring the Dr. Brown's. They definitely reduced the amount of gas our baby was swallowing thus reducing the amount of spit up and burps.The measurements on the bottles are spot on, thus mixing formula in them is really easy.The bottles are very durable as are the nipples. They take a beating and still look brand new, including the measurement markings. I'm fairly certain the bottles we have will last until our baby is eating just solid food.And yeah, the parts are a pain to clean. But we can live with that. It's not a huge, huge deal.I will say that the Playtex disposables were just as good in terms of gas prevention, but we didn't feel good about throwing away all those plastic containers and the added cost of purchasing them. As well, the measurements on them were wildly inaccurate and thus totally useless."
4,Vacuum free for a strong sucker,"I started my son on these at 4 days old. He took to them well immediately. He is still occassionally gassy so I decided to try other bottles. He collapsed all the nipples on any other bottle except these, and even managed to suck the nipple into the bottle of one brand. That was enough proof to me that they work. The only annoying thing is cleaning all the parts. My husband calls it my chemistry set."
5,Favorite bottles - chic and effective,"I tried a lot of bottles with my kids and they ONLY liked these ones. To them, the nipple felt most natural. I didn't buy them for the scientific aspect of the system, but the way the nipples and bottles are shaped (and they are good looking).As for cleaning, I just throw all the pieces in the dishwasher and they come out spotless."
4,LOVE THIS ITEM,"MY CHILDREN ARE PREMATURE AND I HAD TWINS I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO WORK FOR THEM AND STOP THEM FROM BEING COLIC, THIS WAS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR THEM, IT TOOK AWAY MOST OF THE PROBLEMS, MY CHILDREN WERE NO LONGER COLIC AND THEY WOULD EAT MORE FROM THIS BOTTLE COMPARED TO AVENT. THE NIPPLES WERE SOFT SO IT MADE IT EASY FOR MY CHILDREN, I DIDNT LIKE THEM CAUSE THEY WOULD LEAK FROM THE BROWN PART WERE AIR WAS SUPPOSE TO GO IN FROM AND IT TOOK MORE TIME TO CLEAN IT, IT WAS WORTH WHILE IN THE BEGGINING.BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GO OUT AND WASH IT WAS VERY INCOVINIENT. THERE WAS TOO MANY PIECES TO WASH."
1,difficult to drink from,My 3 month old son was unable to get milk to come out of the nipple despite having no problems with any other bottles. We switched to Avent and LOVE that system.
2,Not as good as it sounds,I bought these bottles because of all the great reviews. I'm sorry to say that I have to disagree. These bottles took longer to clean and prepare than was necessary and my daughter still had problems spitting up. I eventually started using the ventaire bottles and am very pleased.
1,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks!","This bottle leaks entirely too much! I have to clean out my bottle warmer everytime I used these bottles. Born Free bottles are the best! They are great in preventing colic and gas, plus no leakage."
3,Get the names right!,"I bought this book, because I personally know people in the 1st Battalion 8th Marines. I really enjoyed how the author used real names and interviewed the Marines. Getting to read quotes from Marines I know really enstilled a sense of pride. I liked reading about people I knew and officers I had heard mentioned in converstaion. However, many facts in the book were incorrect. Some of the names were incorrectly documented, and companies that were present in some of the situations were not mentioned. The book is also seems very repetitive. As I was reading it, I kept thinking, ""Have't I already read this?"" The author may not have gotten some of the facts right, but he did a great job in portraying the perspective of the Marines in Operation Phantom Fury."
3,Good ground work poor writing,"The writer of ""Falluja with honor"" has done a great job in collecting eye witness reports from a lot of the soldiers from 1/8 Marines.BUT it is a pitty that the author does not know how to put all the collected information in to a coherent book. The book is a mess. the same story is told over and over again by the different eye witnesses. The author makes no effort in making the book readable.The only reason i finished the book was because I think the story was exiting. It was quite a strugle to get through.If you want a book about falluja buy ""no true glory""."
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"Earlier incarnations of this book, ""E for Ecstasy,"" ""Ecstasy and the Dance Culture,"" and ""Ecstasy Reconsidered,"" have been chosen for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy."" http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy"
4,Entertaining Movie,"Originally saw this movie via internet streaming and I liked it so much, that I purchased the Blu-Ray DVD version for my movie collection. For me, this was a very entertaining movie. I definitely recommend it."
1,Not for me.,"A great movie....for a 12 year old.The kid is this movie was very irritating, really spoiled the movie.Very nearly bought this, I'm just glad i rented it first."
1,NOT Rocky with Robots,"If only there were a zero star option. This movie has been described as Rocky with robots...this it is not. The movie requires the complete suspension of belief from the very first scene...and not just some of the technology in a futuristic world. I had so much to say while watching the movie, but it's taken away my will. I will say that I am a huge fan of science fiction, and this movie had a lot of potential. It in actuality was a travesty. It hurts the reputation of Spielberg and Jackman. There are movies made for 11 year old's that adults can enjoy...that wasn't even attempted here. Do yourself a favor and take a nap while the little ones watch this...unless you want to instill an appreciation for quality cinema in them. In that case rent something else."
1,"Real Steel, REAL LAME!..sadly just like real life","This movie was definitely inspirational to many. This movie attempts to make you feel there is hope of making up for not being present in your child's life. For the ladies, this movie wants to give you hope that the loser you are just too lazy to leave and too lazy to kick in the butt will suddenly transform into a great dad and partner. It achieves this through a boy that is more adult than any grown up in the whole movie. Which he had to be since there are no mature adults present in his life or the whole country for that matter. What a waste of time. If I wanted to see a display of lame uninspiring adults...I would have gone to Wal-mart."
4,Good heartwarming movie.,I really liked this. It's not going to win an oscar but the performances were good and Hugh Jackman was fun. It was far more heartwarming than I expected.
3,Heart-warming,"This movie was a heart-warmer. Watching Hugh Jackman play a dead-beat, irresponsible, impulsive loser was definitely a role I'm not used to seeing him in. I got my first taste of Hugh-Jackman-Awesomeness when I watched him play Wolverine in Xmen, and Gabriel Van Helsing in Van Helsing, (which BTW are both equally awesome movies). So his performance as Charlie Kenton in Real Steel caught me off guard. I enjoyed watching his transformation from a cowardly jerk who sells off his son for 50k - into a man who slowly changes into something more on a summer-long, robot-boxing, road-trip with that same son.I do have to say that the storyline was pretty predictable - nothing happened in the general plot that surprised me, but the ending was cheering and heart-warming and, really, what else could you ask for on a cold, snowy night? I give Real Steel 3.5 stars."
4,Good story,I like the kid in the story as he didn't take any crap from the adults. He stole the show and was smarter than the older people in the story though he should be.Very good action movie.
3,Nothing Special,"The short story ""Steel"" upon which this film is based is done a great disservice by this film adaptation. The Twilight Zone episode starring the great Lee Marvin was much more serious and dark in tone. The B&W presentation also enhanced this story by making that future world look even more bleak. While I am a Hugh Jackman fan, I did not care much for his effort in this weak movie. Hugh is not the type of actor that can carry a film on his own. He needs a decent script and direction. This movie has neither. This film is a fluff piece of CGI that is worth a single viewing and then forgotten. It's not a waste of your life, but its not an enhancement of much value either."
5,Good movie.,"Real SteelThis was a great movie. Lots of action. My husband and my son loved it!!! I don't know if I'm into these types of movies, but they loved it! Thank you."
4,Real Steel,Real Steel is your could watch the movie. Because if you order movies or free. You downloadMovies or Tv.
1,UNRETURNABLE + Need big amp,i am giving this a low rating as a counterweight to those who claim that they sound good even withoutan amp. they sound like hollow caca without an amp in my opinion. i had 4x40 watt rms head unit andit just did not work.good learning experience in that you cant return these either due to some hazardous materials policy.who knew ?buyer beware.
1,"Good story, poorly written","Very disappointing. The truth is a compelling story, which has gotten mired down in a bog of poor writing. The writing is tedious, filled with needless descriptions and details, stiff dialogue, unrealistic characters, and overly blatant foreshadowing. The book appears to be well researched, but does not deliver."
4,CD/radio player good,The radio works just fine. It is for my kitchen. On some cds it has a high pitch ring squeal.
3,Omega Don't (Show It)_Blind Fun with Fury,"Did anyone realize that Rutger owes thanks for his swordsmanship on screen to Sho Kosugi for being willing to give him some last minute training for the film? Not to mention Sho played the Yakuza swordsman hired to take out Rutger at the end. Had it not been for Sho Kosugi, Rutger would have had no chance of pulling off some know-how with the sword. The film is fun and quite comedic! Rutger plays a good-hearted blind man in the film and triumphs over the assassin brought in to kill him!I wish they had used Sho more in the storyline. I liked his entrance before the film's final fight sequence!!! Five stars for Sho Kosugi minus two stars due to the unrealistic swordsmanship of a blind Rutger Hauer! Hollywood goes way beyond realism once again. Not that any of Sho's movies didn't lack realism with a hypnotizing ninja in Revenge and ninjas being dragged down the street without his flesh being worn to the bone. What fun those old movies were, huh? Enjoy this one!"
5,"very, very amusing","This video is amusing even for adults. The humor is very well done. It pokes fun at Barney-type shows (Mary Moo Cow) and itself ('Everyday when you're walking down the street, you stop and think...', the Andy show), as well as incorporates various animation styles (South Park, Dexter's laboratory, Batman the cartoon, etc.). The psychedelic Love Ducks is just too hilarious.The writers for Arthur are geniuses."
2,Good but not so good,"The technical hints and tips in this book are unmatched. But the way flickenger referrs to hackers as 'naturally anti-authoritarian' in the beginning is simply stupid. It brings down the whole meaning of a hacker. He sounds just like cnn or nbc in the beginning of this book. If you buy it, skip the first 10 pages and jump right into the tips and code."
3,Shows it age but...,"This book shows its age (which is quite expected since GNU/Linux is such a fast moving target) but still includes some good tips and tricks for system administration and advanced level use of GNU/Linux systems. If you're some who really need this book then you'll also need 'Linux Server Hacks, Volume Two: Tips & Tools for Connecting, Monitoring, and Troubleshooting'."
3,wrong years posted confusing reviewers,"The reviews posted are actually for Fall Brawl 2000, while the picture is of Fall Brawl '93! Please do not get confused!"
2,Sucked!,"Only one match worth a crap and that was Goldberg Vs. Scott Steiner (back when ""Big Poppa Pump"" was any damn good)! Otherwise, avoid this video."
4,Some Good and Some Bad,The Good matches were TV Title between Badd and Regal and Bagwell and Patriot and Bvagwell Vs Pretty Wonderful for the Tag Straps.The Triangle bout was so bad Sting couldn't save it.The most brutal match of the night went to the Career match between Sullivan and Cactus Jack.
1,Fall Brawl,This event is defiatly not worth the price of $60. Although it is better in spanish the matches are lame. This is the only choice of Fall Brawl because you don't have to listen to the annoying comentators throughout the entine event.
1,Be aware of this product (and seller)!!!,"SF Planet fulish customers with fake image. It's not Duracell, but very chip looking ""no brand"" battery! Probably, it is the same product that available from other sellers for the price $1.40-$5 per item (or per lb?). It was shipped also in the pack with picture of different battery on the face and marked as ""video camera battery "". Very disapointed!"
2,Nice Picture POOR QUALITY,Got my Sharp Aquos for Christmas. Picture was nice but it quit working after only four months. I called Sharp and was informed the warranty is only three months. I can't believe they get away with doing business like this. Never again will I buy a Sharp product.
3,writing only so so,"The plot was pretty good, but some of the characters and dialogue were silly. Does the author really think people selected for such sensitive missions will be violent, sexist, un-self-controlled clods? She seems to think society is actually going to REgress to more sexism in the next 40 years. Either that, or she needed a loony for plot purposes."
4,"kinda corny, but loved it anyway","Fun action, personable characters, and interesting ideas. Definitely a keeper even if the story was a bit corny. Easy to overlook the flaws. I'll read more by Kenyon."
3,SuperBomb 2000,"The main event lasted 9 minutes. Guys like Sid, Hall, and JJ could pull off a better 3-way dance for the coveted gold. How bad is it when you say Hogan's match was better than the main event?! Flair/Funk death match was the best show of the nite. James Brown made an appearance, which was interesting. The card looks promising on paper, but an 11 match card(plus the James Brown stuff) cut matches too short to be defined. Coulda been better."
1,Does not record at specified length and does not recognize card.,"I bought this player from walgreens on sale,got it home like the ease of the buttons and film quality was good, but it does not record at nearly the specified recording times and does not recognize my memory card at all. Taking it back and getting my money."
3,Daughter uses RCA digital recorder,"Length:: 1:23 MinsThe RCA digital recorder is a lot of fun for my 13 y o daughter for sleep novers, birthday parties, etc."
2,Terrible picture quality,"i purchased a 60min. flip camera from pure digital and loved it. then, a friend of mine got the rca small wonder, and i was jealous! i had to have one because of the extra features: flip screen, tripod mount and expandable memory. so i sold my flip and ordered the rca small wonder. i was so disappointed. the video is just terrible. so, i returned the small wonder and purchased the new upgrade of the flip which is 2GB, but still 60 min. great picture quality and they have made many improvements: quiet buttons (cannot hear them on your video), separate on/off switch, tripod mount...etc.....bottom line: spend a little more and get the flip ultra."
5,Best Off Road Game EVER!!!,"This game is the best because there is a veriety of choices between what you can be ATV, Motorcycle, Helicopter, Plane, Sand Rail And MORE!! One Bad thing it king of takes to long to load each race. Grafics are super. There are also a lot of tracks you can unlock like Glamis. Another cool thing is you can choose wheather your a Motorcycle or ATV of haveing a 2-Sroke or 4-Sroke engine lots of optons for you bike and ride to have the way YOU like it. Overall a 5 star game and worth buying."
3,Melissa's Review,I am glad I purchaced the food processor however I don't think it puree's the food right down. In some instances it is still quite lumpy and my child has a hard time with it. So I would get it for when your child is a little older like 9 months. For things like meat I still have to use my big blender which is a bit of a bummer cause that's what I thought I could use this for.
1,not working at all,don't buy this product. this new model is not working at all. previous reviews were based on older model. Not this one!! The older model worked great but this new model doesn't work at all. It's very dangerous to feed baby if you use this new model to process fruits!!! Foods remins solid even you run this machine for a while!
3,It's Great But......,"This little processor does process the food well. But for some reason I have the worst luck with it. Its predecessor, an older dex processor, lasted 5 years through daily use (my daughter cannot have solid food). This one went dead within a week. Got a replacement, and that one said bye-bye in less than a month. I said bye- bye to Dex processors after that.Bottom line...great little processor for small jobs. Great Customer service from the Dex representatives. For regular use...get something else."
