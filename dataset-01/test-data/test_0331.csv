4,Legal Writing made easy,This book is written in plain language that makes it easy to understand. The exercises are helpful as well.
2,DONT GET IT,"I bought this remote because it was cheap and seemed easy to program. Well, it was easy to program with my TV. I hate this remote because I have to change the batteries every week! If you like wasting a bunch of AAA batteries then this is the remote for you."
2,terrible product,"these are badly made shoes, i have owned them for about 2 weeks now and they are already falling apart. the material they are made of rips really easily, do not buy!"
4,ALICE IS (AND WILL ALWAYS BE) COOL!!!,"This is a great Alice Cooper Cd. (I just give it 4 stars cuase, to me, nothing beats the cds Brutal Planet & The Last Temptation). Again, my fav drummer Eric Singer (of KISS), drums on this cool Alice Album. Unlike Brutal Planet, It's not a heavy, heavy record, but has a twist of old school rock Alice from the School's Out & Billion Dollar Babies Days mixed with the newer rock sound. A tad poppy, but it certainly screams ALICE. Alice maybe older, but with lyrics on the songs What Do You Want From Me, Man of the Year and Novacane, Alice shows he knows whats going on in society and reflects angst and humor in these great songs. Other cool songs are Detroit, Back Yard Brawl and the Horror-esque This House is Haunted. If you want a fun rock album in your collection by the Horror Music Legend, pick this one up!! It's worth it!!"
4,Ummmm....You must be misinformed,"According to many websites that I have visited Dragontown was the last part in the Brutal Planet Trilogy. The first album being The Last Temptation, and the second Brutal Planet. So those of you that were disappointed that Alice didn't ""finish"" the trilogy, you might want to know that he did."
5,He's Back.....,"He Rules! This Album is the best ever, it's up there with ""DragonTown"", ""Hey Stoopid"", and ""Alice Cooper Classicks"".Alice is the best in his domain, the king is back with one of the most cool and powerful albums. The funny lyrics to ""The Song That Didn't Ryhme"", will get you dancing and laughing.Go Alice!"
3,Great Songs...Where's The Guitar Solos?,"Arguably Alice's best album in a decade as far as pure songwriting. Great melodies, hooks, chorus's and lyrics. My only ""beef"" is the absence of any gut wrenching guitar riffs or guitar solos. A few songs have ""Thin Lizzy-ish"" melody riffs and Wayne Kramer plays a fair solo while half alseep on ""Detroit"", but that's about it. No ""Schools Out"" lead breaks on this release. So if you love Alice, this is a must have; but if you love Alice & the twin guitar attack of Michael Bruce & Glenn Buxton (I doubt if Buxton would be ""proud"" at the lack of guitar leads)from Alice's 70's ""heyday"", you won't find anything even close here."
5,Fresh look at an old story,"This book challenged almost everything I have been told or thought about the Genesis account of creation. The author asserts that modern translations, including the King James Version, suffer from cosmological presuppositions that bias our reading of the ancient account. Very compelling."
4,Pretty good product,"The power scrubber is a pretty good product - heavier than I expected and a bit unwieldy when turned on. However, if you can keep it under control then you have the benefit of being at a distance from the scum and grime being scrubbed (though it does spray around a bit).Keep in mind - doesn't pump a cleanser onto the head, so repeated dunking into a bucket is necessary."
5,Awesome product!,I thought the scrubber was just for washing cars. I soon found out that it can be used to effectively wash sidewalks and vinyl siding as well. The battery life is great and its convenient the way the battery is interchangeable with my other black and decker products.
1,What did I just watch,What did I just watch? whoever produced this movie needs to be shot. this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It rivals napoleon dynamite as one of the most pointless waste of time possible.
1,Junk,"I couldn't say it any better than Mommabookworm ""Mommabookworm"" (Ca.) did.So put me down for a ditto I've already wasted too much time on this movie.Thanks"
1,Enough already!,This is a redo of all Bob Greene books. How long is Oprah going to promote him? If he showed up at my door for my workout everyday I would look great. Until then weight is lost the same way in every diet book. EAT LESS DO MORE. Save your money and get off your butt.
3,Just okay.,"Not my favorite of the series, but worth reading for the information that impacts future tales. I admit to speed reading this one."
4,Great layout for the series,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book very much. Though some parts seemed a bit juvenile, it's impossible NOT to have that when the 3 main characters are younger children. But the plot is ALWAYS on the move, and I'm really excited to see what the rest of the series brings."
5,The Holy Grail before Da Vinci Code!,"This book was a favourite of my son's in the 1980's and I have now read it to my Granddaughter . The first book is written for quite young readers, but the story strengthens with each book."
4,I also purchased the series,This is an exciting adventure series of children and their quests. I could not stop wih just this one book of the series. Susan Cooper is very good. This is the first book of hers that I have read but not my last.
4,"More mainstream than Sigur Ros, but still good","I heard of Leaves when I listened to ""I Go Down."" I read some reviews comparing the album to Sigur Ros, so, with those two things in mind, I bought the album.I don't think the Sigur Ros comparison is valid - the tracks on Breathe have much more of a mainstream sound and structure, where as Sigur Ros has entire albums without a traditional type of song.Nonetheless, I did enjoy the first last last parts of the album (I found the middle few tracks to be a bit too generic for my liking). Some of the tracks could easily pass as Coldplay, while others the Doves."
3,"not coldplay, definetly NOT sigur ros","i really don't see why people compare them to sigor ros or coldplay. they certainly have absolutely nothing to do with the former, besides that they're both from iceland... and coldplay? sure, he sings in falsetto here and there, but that's about it. it's much more fitting to compare them to the verve, whose style they're far closer to than either of the above bands.overall a good, fairly mellow cd, but please don't expect a new sigur ros or coldplay, as it says on the front of the cd package."
3,better hoses out there,"My brother is a contractor and has compressor hoses similar to this. They are very light weight, rarely kink, and are easy to coil up.I bought a couple of these thinking they were the same quality as the one's my brother had. Unfortunately they tangle more easily and don't coil up quite as nice. They are still much better than the traditional bulky compressor hoses but don't perform as well as I had hoped compared to others I have used. For this reason I give this product 3 stars."
1,Less than average hose,"This is a product that i was exxcited to get but was all too dissapointed in. These hoses will not hold up to the 250 psi that they are claimed to do. There have been countless times that the hoses have burts at the nozzle. If they are not expanding and burting out they are pulling off the end of the cheaply desinged hook up. Bought three hoses and have been unsatisfied with each. A poor product that has lost me time and money. I would stick with the 1/2"" hoses in place of these."
3,my kitty wasn't too interested,"Maybe the one I gave her wasn't as fresh, but I had accidentally bought 2 of these and my cat smelt it a bit then ignored it. I gave the extra one to a friend and her cat went crazy over it."
4,I was far too harsh...,"I was angry because I was told they would sound a LOT different than what they actually do. So, naturally, I dismissed them as crap. However, after a third sit-through, I have completely changed my mind. This band is AMAZING. Enough said."
4,Good follow-up,"This is a very good album that makes a person want to go out and start beating people up for no apparent reason. That's how aggresive and heavy this album is. There is a lot and do I mean a lot of cursing in this album and it's mostly directed to an ex that left him. A few good songs are love lost in a hale of gunfire, on wings of lead and the last song with the most curse words I've ever heard in one song: revenge I seek.There is a lot of swedish metal elements in the music and it is very well blended with hardcore to create a monster of an album. As good as this album is in my personal opinion portrait of the goddess was a little bit better. So pick this one up and make sure to get their previous album also if you can find it."
2,"Boring, Uninspired stuff","Just a very boring album. Not horribly executed, just BORING, generic material. On a side note: What the hell is the purpose of the keyboards in this band! It adds NOTHING to any of the songs; I think she actually plays the same thing in every song as well. Ditch her, she is wasting a portion of the paycheck.Recommended instead (for American Metal/Metalcore): Unearth, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, God Forbid, Shadows Fall."
3,Sounds the same,"I love bleeding through they are an amazing band. their album Portraits of the Goddess blew me away. All Their instruments sounded awesome. Their singer rocked too. And then they brought this album out ""This is Love, This is Murderous. I have never seen a cd get so much hype, but it didnt deserve all of it. I was disapointed by it, although it was good. It sill wasn't as good as their previous album. And it sounded the exact same. So i would advise ne one who wants to buy this album, to first buy Portraits of the Goddess."
1,My damn eardrums are BLEEDING...,This album cannot possibly have sucked more. ANYONE WHO SHOWS REMOTE INTEREST IN THIS ALBUM IS EITHER UNDER THE AGE OF 15 OR IS NOT A TRUE ROCK FAN. This is a disgrace to the metal-core genre -- embarrassing to say the least. This is why there are people who listen to hip hop.
1,No negative stars?,"Teen garbage. All they do is complain about life and fantasize about death. The only reason they are so successfull is because they provide an outlet of anger for immature teenagers that can't grow from pain or learn how to properly take on responsibility. Your better off looking into more artistic and creative bands like A Perfect Circle, Tool, Incubus, System Of A Down, Rage Against The Machine, Nirvana, etc.Nothing enlightening about this band."
4,Formidable talent,"I've been in possession of Matthew Ryan's Regret Over The Wires for approximately 2 weeks, but man, words can't even begin to describe just how good this guy is and how much his music means to me.Matthew Ryan is a gritty realist and champion of the underpriveledged. He possesess a rough-hewn voice and just happens to makes transcendantly beautiful music. 'Return To Me', 'Long Blvd.', 'I Can't Steal You' and 'Skylight' never fail to send shivers up my spine. In fact, everything on this album does. This is music with soul, gravity, grit and achingly good hooks.Essential listening."
4,Worth it,"Bought these to use while mowing lawn on a garden tractor. They are perfect for this type of use. The noise they block is quite sufficient and it's great to have some entertainment. I like to listen to AM radio and you need to have a good strong station to listen to. As your head turns (as with most radios on AM) the station can fade in and out. The voices have too much bass for me and it can be hard to tune with the little analog knob. But for the money, I'm glad I got them and I usually only listen to a strong AM station anyway. FM works fine. Not sure about longevity, but they seem to be built pretty good."
4,Good product could be better,"I have used them once while mowing my lawn and the noise reduction on the head phones is fine, reception on the radio was so so, but part of my problem was with the tuner button. My suggestion for improvement would be to have a digital style tuner and an input to allow you to attach your mp3 player with a volume restriction to still protect your hearing."
4,Lawn company,"It was a gift for my husband. He uses it to protect his ears and listen to music at the same time. He uses it every time, so I'd say it's worth the money."
2,Volume limitation makes these useless,"While the noise-blocking efficiency is very good, unfortunately the radio volume cannot be increased beyond a whisper. AM reception is poor.The radio's maximum volume limitation renders these little more than fancy earmuffs."
4,Let You Know What is KPI,"He tells you how important it is to develop necesary Key Performance Indicator for managing your company, department, team and yourself."
4,wet suit,"The wet suit performed well was comfortable and warm. I was in the Cayman Islands for two weeks and used it 14 times between diving and snorkling. As most people stated the sizing is way off. I ordered an x-large and it was too small I am 6' and 195 lbs. The 2x I ordered worked well and my wife liked the xl and kept it she is 5'9"" and of average build"
4,Fit well,Seemed to fit well though the kneepads were a bit high. Seems to be better for tall people like me. It did feel a little tight but I guess all wetsuits are like that. Excellent deal for the price.
3,colorado handbook,"OK, the author is more into mountain biking and skiing rather than hiking. Not as good as moon press's Arizona book and northern California book"
3,Great if you have the bands not so great without it.,I bought this thinking it would help me loose belly fat. I am disappointed to discover that if you don't have the bands this DVD will not work for you. Both DVD uses the bands through out the DVD's. It is hard to follow without the bands. So unless you have them or know where to buy them andor willing to use them don't buy this set of DVD's. I wished that someone had warned me.
1,Not a Great Workout,"I did not like these 2 dvd workouts at all. They were the most poorly, unprofessionally made workouts I have ever come across. At one point Billy Blanks bends down to tie his shoe!!!! They never do the same amount of reps on each side, the people were obnoxious with the yelling. I love a good workout and don't have time to waste I would pass on this one. I sold the set on ebay for $7.50 I took a loss on that one."
3,NO Bands NO Workout!,"This is a very High Energy, fast moving workout. If you are familiar with the original Billy Blanks' Tae Bo Workouts; this one is much quicker with more complex moves. Not effective without the proper Bands. I prefer the original workout more. I don't like the idea of performing strength-resistance moves at a very fast pace because this can open the door to injury much easier. Exercise smart, not hard! It's the consistency of any workout that counts most."
1,There must be 10 odder and better books,"As a Dutchman I enjoy reading travelbooks about my own country. I bought this one but was a little dissappointing. There are many more things to see in Amsterdam near the routes in this book. Just a few different ways to walk will let you see more and more.There are some interesting facts but a lot more could be told, if you are interested in the history that is.I am also a little embarressed about the writing. It's definitely a Dutchman who wrote it. There are words in there no one uses and most Americans/Englishmen won't understand either. It's not very 'folky' which makes it weird sometimes. The worst one was the use of 'odder' for other, they way we usually pronounce the dd.get another one."
1,Bad Movie,"I am consistanly amazed how stupid people are. BOOOOO! Ghost will get you, and so will the fairy god mother!"
1,WORST EVER!!!,BAD:I buy it and heared it once.GOOD:Hope it will be Ladies.In.Male.Pants Bizkit`s last album.
4,CD mislabeled,Overall a good cd as far as the music. It has a lot of music. The tracks were mislabeled. CD one is listed as CD two. Either the song list is mislabeled or the CD itself. Also the songs are different than listed on the preview page on Amazon. The music was very good and there is a lot of music.
2,chickens steal my sanity!!...,"....this game is really stupid, when i bought this game it looked pretty fun. but i played it and it was way to easy. this was a game that was ment for kids way under 12. this game would skip, freeze, and do other wierd things. i beat this whole game in an hour, whithuot the memory card.tell me thats not sad. any way graphics are horendus, storyline is realy child like. some of these levels are really stupid the the one whithout any apponents, and just coins, to me thats fruity"
2,Great idea but doesn't deliver.,"This is a great idea but did not deliver. When it gets warm it doesn't fold back up well, it just wads up. I then have to wait for a cooler time to refold it the whole length to make it fit back in the bracket. It is a hassle. It retracts fine when it is cool, but that is counter-intuitive, I need to use it when it is HOT. And since it had permanent adhesive you can't just take it out and return it.**Update I stand by the product review I wrote earlier. The seller did take this as a return and refund even without the mounting that are STILL stuck to my windshield. I give the seller credit for being reasonable about this."
4,Better than others,"It is the second one I have own and I believe it is not the ""perfect"" innovation, but a good one. I love that in no time it covers my windshield. Why did I gave than only 4 stars? It pulls back pretty good, but it takes time to get everything in order to have it stored in the plastic cover.Would I recommend it to others? YES"
5,I love this product!,"I will probably start using this product for my normal spot treatments, but for right now I use it on hard to get out cloth diaper stains. It works wonders with the help of the sun when I line dry. Most of the stains come out just fine, and it also doesn't hurt the environment. I love this product!"
3,It is okay,I like it for cleaning carpets but that is all. They sent me the stain remover not the all purpose. Also the product was open and taped and the box was wet full of the product. But over all the product was okay.
5,"Great Cleaner, especially for pets!","I love that this cleaner is non-toxic, eco-friendly, and best of all - it works great!!!! I have three pugs and they create their share of messes in the house, but this product works great to get out even the worst stains! Plus, it has a wonderful lemon-lime scent that is great. I'm even thinking of using this green cleaner in our carpet steam cleaner."
4,So far so good,"The battery came on an open little plastic bag; it did not come with any instructions or any info at all. The product was sold as ""new"" but who knows if it was new. So far it is charging fine and holding the charge for a good amount of time. I assume it was almost new, and for the price I think it is fine.I would advice to the seller to put a little note inside indicating that the product is new/used, or that the info of the product was not included for whatever reason.So far so good."
4,Blackberry Battery,The order was received in timely fashion. It worked and I'm happy with my purchase.
1,Worse than the one it was replacing,Full charge all day then tried to use it. Would not last one hour streaming music on the Blackberry. Not worth trying to send back.
2,Disturbing,"I did not like this book. It was realistic because i know things like racism and discrimination happen all the time, but i didn't think it was very well written, and the charectar Laurel should have had a bigger part in the book. If you are into scary, disturbing books like this, i recommend it, but if you are not, don't waste your money."
1,Warning : EA Games has Closed these Servers,"EA Games decided to close out the game on Setpember 22, 2004 so it can no longer be played. Please keep this in mind when purchasing this game."
2,You'll see everything after about 2 weeks of play,"The title says it all. This game is pretty darn fun during the first hours of play. The graphics are good, the quests fairly engaging, the gameplay on-par with other MMORPGs.Unfortunately, the universe really is rather small. With heavy play, you'll see and do just about everything in 2 or 3 weeks. But hey, the first month is free so paying [$] for a game that will keep you entertained for almost a month is probably not a bad deal. Just don't expect real staying power."
1,don't waste your money,"The title says it all.The game itself is visually very pretty, but there is little to no content, the network is constantly lagged, and expect 0 support for any problems you have. You may think that I am exaggerating when I say 0 support, but it is no lie.Don't waste your money on this game."
5,Playing is believing,"I've been in the beta for 9 months and can't get enough. Even after months at play I still haven't gotten to the top of the food chain. Playing for 3 hours everday, 7 days a week you'd probably 'finish' the game in a year and still be able to interct with thousands on line with you. And to that the awesome group who've been in the forums and the different guilds you can join, this game creates a superb mix of fantasy and on line friendship!Any one who's read sci fi, enjoyed Star Trek, Star Wars and wish they were in the action must get this game. Move over Luke Skywalker, interactive sci fi is finally here!!!!"
2,NOT the game I thought it would be....,"If you are looking for ""Freespace"", ""Tachyon"", or ""WingCommander"" in a MMORPG environment, this is NOT it.I mean... you control your ship with your mouse... need I say more?? Don't get me wrong - this game is very close to being a space jockey's dream... but it does fall short.It is really a solo game with a bunch of ""chat"" going on the whole time. It is so close to being something really cool, but falls short in the end. A good overhaul or two, and it might be worth playing... but as it stands, I'd just as soon break out ""Tachyon"", ""Freespace"", or ""TieFighter"" for that matter..."
2,Not for me....,"I was really disappointed with this cookbook. As much as I enjoy Paula Deen what I've cooked from this book turned out to be slop. The Sunday Morning Casserole was disgusting and bland. Maybe southern cooking just isn't my thing since I'm used to a different kind of palate of european style cooking. God knows I've tried to do the southern cooking thing, but I'll pass on this book and all the rest of her books. I still enjoy Paula's shows and adore her personality. She seems like a real sweetheart."
4,This looks like a good one.,"I can't wait to try more of the recipes in this book. I have a lot of cookbooks, and many of them contain recipes I know I will never make, either because they're too complicated or just don't appeal to me, period. This book, however, lists recipes that are generally short and simple, and the food items look very down-to-earth and appetizing. I bought the book in the first place because several of my friends at work said it was their favorite and contained honest-to-goodness ""real"" food and meals their families like. I think they're right about that."
3,Lady and Sons,I got the book very quickly. I wasn't as thrilled with the recipes as I thought I'd be but the book was in like new condition so it was just a matter of taste.
1,"Too Shallow, wind kept blowing the flame out, poor design.","This 'suitcase' grill is only a few inches deep, gets the flame blown out constantly, and quickly will catch on fire if you have any significant grease buildup, BEWARE! I got this second hand off eBay, for $250.00 I would suggest getting the the Freedom Grill (www.freedomgrill.com) or the Tailgator Grill(www.gatorpit.net) , both of these are true grills that are hitch mounted. Blue Ridge Mtn. Cookery (http://www.classiccookers.com) has some nice commercial catering equipment, but there was definately no planning involved in this design. The only thing I could easily cook was a few hot dogs without the thing getting full of grease and catching fire."
3,"Andrea Bertamino, Flash Magazine, Italy","Brilliant techno/AOR sung in Steve Perry style. Jason tries to offer songs and arrangements different from the usual melodic rock, missing seldom the target (i.e.""Don't take it""). ""Starting Over Again"" and ""Stand Or Fall"" are good songs, releasing a very nice refrain in ""Hold On"" and offering good things in the ballad ""The Groove Song"". Worthy of attention are the pressing AOR ""Can You Read My Mind"", ""Holding The Line"" and ""Lover's Curse"" (imagine them produced by Richie Zito: wow!!!). With a richer budget I'm sure Jason will be able to offer great emotions to all the Journey style fans."
2,"Magnus Florin, Progressive Rock Reviews, Sweden","Jason Gonzalez is sort of like progressive rock similar to the more easy listening kind of music. And then add a lot of Toto and that sort of stuff. Really good actually. A favorite track was ""Holding The Line"", and it don't sound like Toto's old hit if someone wonder. A quite comfortable track for the ear. The whole album is in that direction really, and with a positive spirit over it. This music makes you happy, for sure so if you're depressed, down and lonely...try it!"
2,Ouch..its so bad,"I have been a Cake fan for quite some time now, and I loved how they were so different and had a sense of style all their own. I was blown away and hooked by the first four cds. However, after buying Pressure Chief, I'm convinced the amazing musical energy I once loved so much is no longer existent.Besides ""Wheels"" and ""Guitar Man"" everything else plays on like an electronic mess. ""No Phone"" might just be the worst song I've ever heard, and supposedly it was the first single! The lyrics don't do McCrea any justice as they did on Fashion Nugget, or Motorcade of Generosity, and all around has been a sad dissapointment. Don't get me wrong, I still love Cake. Nobody is perfect, but I would definitely stick to the older Cds if you are interested in seeing what Cake has to offer, because you won't find it on Pressure Chief."
1,A huge let-down,Ive loved most all of Cakes' songs on everyalbum and if I didnt love it then it was at least Ok. Ive tried my hardest to appriciate this album but after 3 attempts Ive lost hope for it. If you like Cake and cant find yourself liking the songs right away dont waste your time trying to lie to yourself.
5,probably the best thing ive heard in my life,a new evolved sound for CAKE. i wont say its better or worse than the old stuff but its new and exciting. this album rocks the socks off of any other non-CAKE CD i've listened to in my life. possibly the best CAKE one too
3,unmistakably cake,"While there is no disputing the band's talent for making excellent albums from start to finish, it seems as if they did stray a little from that on this disk. At times the music makes me smile and at times I wonder why I bought this record. Like previous reviewers, I'm not a big fan of No Phone, or She'll Hang the Baskets."
5,Splendid Extension of Frankenstein,"Livingston and Tinnell's The Living And The Dead is the best thing they have produced to date. Their graphic novel extension of Frankenstein works quite nicely. (Far better than say Steve Niles' graphic novel ""modernization"" of Frankenstein, Wake the Dead.) The artwork by Farritor very much complements the story woven by Livingston and Tinnell. The commentary by Skal on the story and the persistence of Frankenstein in popular culture at the end was good, though it would have been nice had it been a bit more in-depth.Note, The Living And The Dead is contains some material that is for a more mature reader and thus unlike their graphic novel The Black Forest should not be handed to too young of a reader."
3,"Not a terrible story, but not outstanding","The Secret Road is a decent book, although I'm not sure how the title suits the story (I saw little of a ""secret road"" anywhere, unless the whole book took place on some metaphorical road). It keeps the reader's attention, and has some mildly suspenseful moments. I did find it hard to believe how many people were willing to help the characters on their travel northward though. For children who are well-read and are looking for something more, this is a good choice. But don't give it to a average student and expect them to be entranced by it."
2,Not so big house - You have to be kidding!!!!!,"OK, I guess I'm a loser, 'cause these are big homes to me. I guess I was hoping to see not so big houses that were ... well... not so big as in average to small. I was looking for ideas on a second home. I couldn't afford these as my primary home. I would love to see the book - ""Too big Houses"" if these are the not so big ones. If you were after what I was after, you may want a different book, or unless a 3500 - 5500 sq ft home is small to you."
5,Significantly changed the way we will build our new house!,". .The author's perspective will very likely save the reader (who wishes to build) time, money and aggravation.We highly recommended this informative and handsome book. It has the feel of a coffee table book, but has a well articulated reason for being.th"
5,Insightful book with great ideas,"I was starting to think I was crazy for wanting to build a small house, but this book perfectly articulates the thoughts I was having so much conveying. It is a wonderful basis for discussion and offers many practical, well thought out ideas for implementation."
5,A Must-Read for those who want a new home,"When I first bought this book, it validated the kinds of ideas I have been suggesting to my clients. As an architect, I began suggesting this book to prospective clients. Soon, new clients were coming to me for initial consultation with this book in their hands, often dog-eared and full of Post-it-Notes. It joins ""House"" by Tracy Kidder and ""A Pattern Language"" by Christopher Alexander, et.al. as among the books people should read when considering a new home."
2,The Extremely Expensive Not SO Big House.,"Not a practical book for someone on a budget. This book is still for someone with lots of time and money to spend on a home design. However, the book is a great reference for someone w/ the time and money to spend on a home design. Just be prepared to spend more than thought w/ this as a reference. My advice for budget minded home builders, look elsewhere."
4,Definitely worth a read or a listen,"I listened to the audiobook during a trip and enjoyed it very much the same way I did ""The Dante Club"". I feel the hunt through the clues in the Hypnerotomachia was secondary to the evolving friendship between four very different people. The ending was a bit sad in an unexpected way, but I still am glad I listened. I was surprised to read all the negative reviews here, but I suppose if everyone was expecting a face-paced thriller then they would have been disappointed with a lot of great books. The characters are very well-drawn and the settings are vivid."
4,Four Stars For The Rule Of Four,"What a great book. Without the melodrama of a Robert Langdon adventure we have mystery, academic debates, murder, and lost treasure. The scholarship stands head and shoulders above any Dan Brown book. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, not great","This book was given to me as a stocking stuffer, and I was told it was comparable to The DaVinci Code. If this is similar to The DaVinci Code, then I do not understand why it became a world-wide phenomenon. It had its high points and was a relatively easy read, but I was left wanting more. There was very little suspense, and only once did the book keep me up reading longer than I originally intended, but I believe that it was more a case of me hoping something exciting was going to happen instead of something exciting actually happening. There was little build up to key events and too much filler information.Too often I felt the characters in the book, Princeton students, were far too intelligent to be believable. They were geniuses, but perhaps that's why they attend Princeton, and I a local state college. Also, some of the literary references were a stretch, as if the authors were trying to make themselves look as smart as their characters."
2,Scholar's puzzle,"For readers interested in Renaissance, this book is a real treat because it mixes curiousity of modern reader(s) with scholarship related to 14th century Europe. Considering that this book is written by two people, both in their 20s, it is nice to see their potential. Although I do not find it to be a masterpiece, reading it does bring some level of entertainment. It is a definitely popular fiction book, not a classic. Good start for two promising writers."
2,The Rule of Four,"Is a very long slow book that never reaches it's full potential. With that said though, the book does have some endearing qualities as a ""coming of age"" novel. Much of the reading in this book is very bland and wordy, lacking of the real and genuine excitement it deserves. This story is also very implausible, but so much so that it doesn't really hinder the story. Not a bad job for the co-writers first attempt. **"
1,The Rule of Bore...,"While quite an effort was made by the authors to produce a successful mystery/thriller, they remained successful only in describing Princeton University and it's environs. Characters were very poorly developed, came to conclusions suddenly and without any explanation and maintained an interminably dull persona throughout the book.The plot was feeble and did not possess much complexity and contained a number of unplugged holes. The story was tidily concluded with no catharsis in the characters nor any great discovery to help the reader understand the significance of their travails.All said, this books remains more of a travel brochure for Princeton than a mystery/thriller."
2,overhyped and not worth it,It seems so many people enjoyed The Da Vinci Code that they are searching for the sequel or something to match it. This is not that book. The idea behind the book is interesting but you would have to be an expert in ancient philosophy and Greek/Roman history to understand everything. The authors could have been lying about everything they say is true and I would have no idea. A book should never loose their audience for chapters at a time.
2,DaVinci Code Goes to High School,"I waited until I finished the book to write this review, hoping somehow to find something to like. I didn't. If you didn't go to Princeton, you won't either. Who writes the New York Times reviews, anyway?"
3,Some Renaissance Fun,"In the same genre but better written than the rancid ""DaVinci Code,"" although that's not saying much. I skipped through the trials and tribulations of Princeton undergrads, which you'll enjoy if you're an east coast preppie type, otherwise -- kind of boring. Lots of nice historical reference, not too much talking down to the reader -- except for the moment when we are expected to believe that a Renaissance scholar would not think ""Savonarola"" upon hearing the words ""Florence"" and ""Preacher."" An okay book to pick up at the library."
1,Yecch,"If you're thinking of buying this book based on a similarity to the Da Vince Code . . . don't repeat my mistake. There was actually a great deal of promise in the premise, but the internal timing is confusing, the characters whiny and the reader (along with the main character) are *told* the results of the research into the deus ex machina of the Renaissance text in question rather than being able to see it for ourselves. Hell, the discovery of Colonna's crypt takes place entirely off page.This one gets chucked immediately into the donation pile. I think I'll go read Angels and Demons again instead."
2,Not like Da Vinci Code,"I thought this would be similar to the Da Vinci Code and I was disappointed. The first half of the book is the better half, there is a lot of focus on the renaissance text/letter and solving the code. The second half of the book really lost my interest. The second half focused more on relationships and college life.I found that the book was hard to follow as well. There were critical things that needed to be remembered for later times in the book that the authors hardly explained and then other things they talked about in depth that were never brought up again.While I was reading this book I had the thought, ""Did these guys reread after the first draft to make sure everything flowed smoothy?"" It doesn't appear like they did. I thought it was poorly written, especially considering it was a team effort. I would not reccommend this book to anyone."
2,This is not a historical thriller as advertised...,This book was much less of a 'historical based thriller' as it was recommended to me - and much more of a 'coming of age' story that may one day end up as a Lifetime Network movie of the week. This book has more in common with 'Thelma and Louise' than it does with 'The DaVinci Code'. The ONLY thing it really shares with DaVinci is that the story mentions an old book of puzzles - beyond that - its much more about a group of guys in college growing up. If you're looking for 'the next DaVinci code' - move on (perhaps Map of Bones by James Rollins)...
3,Still not sure,"So, I read this one and it took me a couple of weeks which is unusual for me. If I like it, then I can finish it in a day or two. The beginning kept me interested but the middle was extremely boring at times and it skips from past to present a lot. I found myself skipping pases on more than one occasion. But, I did make myself finish it and I did like the ending. Overall, the book the book is based on is hard to pronounce, its draggy, and basically written for more poeple attending Harvard who have way more education than necessary."
1,A waste of time.,"If I could give this book minus stars I would. It was one of the most boring, unoriginal books I have ever read. The worst thing about this book is that it lacks any sincerity. The authors write as if they are trying to convince themselves that they are cool. They write about love the same way a fourteen year old girl write about love in her diary - nave, hopeful, but totally uninformed. They write about tragic lose the same way angst rock bands do - badly. They write with the cadence of a car accident - chaotic, unpredictable, and noisy. Don't waste your money on this sophomoric garbage."
1,Ignore the hype,"Where do I begin? Firstly, this book reads like a promotional brochure for Princeton. Secondly, the brochure is poorly written. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is stilted, the 'mystery' is non-existent, and the plot moves only marginally faster than a turtle in quicksand.It is fairly obvious from the outset that this is some sort of coming-of-age novel, however, phrases like ""Adulthood is a glaciar encroaching quietly on youth"" make me wonder if the authors themselves have yet to mature.Shame on the writer of the jacket blurb who compared The Rule of Four to The Name of the Rose. Comparing Caldwell/Thomason to Umberto Eco is akin to comparing Danielle Steele to Virginia Woolf.If you feel the need to read this book then go your library or borrow it from someone. It's not worth $40."
1,Save your money,"I expected great things from the hype, and I'm really glad I got this book from my local library. I'd have been furious had I spent money for it. This book was boring. Enough said."
1,Utter Disappointment,"I've never written a book review, or have even felt the need until now. I was so thoroughly bored and disappointed by this book I am compelled to share my thoughts now.I am normally a huge fan of this genre, having read and listened to (Books on CD) quite a number of mystery/suspense novels. This was by far the worst book I have ever listened to! From the beginning I didn't care about the dull and pretentious characters. The story line was so weak that I never cared what happened, even if I tried to force myself to.Basically what I am saying is that I really hated this book! I know that's a strong word but I was so angry after listening to the CDs that I had wasted my money on this! To even try to compare this book the The Da Vinci Code is a sin. I do not recommend this book at all in any way."
1,The Rule of Bore,"Comparisons to the Da Vinci Code are unfair because this book is not in that league. The authors danced around a fascinating story but got bogged down exploring uninteresting and dull characters. What made it more frustrating is that they brought the reader to the brink of something really interesting, then slid back down into their boring characters. After slogging through it over the course of week, I'm still wondering what all the fuss is about."
2,"deceptive title-story sinks under the weight of ""padding""","if you are truly interested in intellectual puzzle books, this would be one to avoid. if you are interested in the nostalgic memories of ivy league ""intellectuals"", their friendships, love affairs, social gatherings, dorm hi-jinks, you could do better than this.under the guise of a ""mystery"", these young writers have attempted to romanticize their college days (who cares?) and every couple of chapters, a little puzzle or riddle is thrown out (in) to keep you reading. neither the memories nor the characters nor the ""mystery"" were enough to make the book worthwhile. pasadena on this one, guys..."
2,"Authors have potential, but haven't quite made it yet","Comparisons by the publishers are being made between these young authors and Umberto Eco.....they don't even come close. It's an OK start for two young writers, but is far from genius. The book's intended audience seems to be Princeton grads, who I am sure would get a kick out of the details, I myself grew numb with them and found much to be unneccessary and distracting. I especially found the ""romance"" aspect of the story to be unrealistic and it only served to broadcast the youth and inexperience of the two authors."
2,it had such promise....,it was hard...but i read through the entire book. i just keep thinking that the end would be worth it. the end did offer some promise of a more interesting read so the next book may be better...overall the whole book just seemed like a really long prologue.
1,Terrible,"Unless ""The Rule of Four"" is really an intricate, coded treasure map in disguise, it's useless. Dwelling mostly on a self-important Princeton undergraduate and a two-dimensional romance, and driven by a sluggish and uninspiring plot, this ""thriller"" failed to meet my expectations - and they weren't very high.I was hoping only that this would be a fast-paced, mindless book in which I could lose myself for a few hours. Sadly, it is a tedious exercise in boredom that oozes with pretention and smug self-congratulation (though, to be fair, it IS mindless). After hundreds of pages that read like a Princeton-only edition of People Magazine, the ""mystery"" around which the plot revolves is dealt with in a matter of pages, and ultimately left unresolved."
2,Pretentious,"writing is simple but still manages to be lofty and pretentious. This idyllic Princeton relationship between four friends may indeed be accurate, but difficult to relate to (and frankly believe) if you did not attend that school."
1,Finally it's over,What a waste of time this book was. I didn't care about any of the pretentious characters nor did I come to share their interest in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. But I hung in there hoping for a great ending that never happens.
1,Who bypassed the editor?,"I read this book based on the ongoing hype. I wasted a day reading this book.There is NO comparison to The Da Vinci Code This book is based on weak and boring characters who don't fit together in the story. There is little mystery here. This book is about immature boys trying to find themselves among the snobbery that exists at Princeton. It is more about our class system then anything. It extremely hard to follow because the authors jump around between the boys finding themselves, love, murder and a book. Should have been edited by professionals. Wait for the paperback to come out and save a buck or two! Back to Dan Brown...."
1,Ivy League slop,"In the Rule of Four, the authors quote that ""there's no worse thief than a bad book"". How ironic, as this is possibly one of the most poorly written books I have read. The writing is overblown as if the authors are doing their darndest to impress you with how smart they are. Perhaps they realized that if you are confused by the awkward sentences and chronology, then you might not notice how lame the very frequent digressions are.I wonder if the Ivy does take out?"
1,Forget It,"I don't see how this book can be compared to Da Vinci Code. The book was boring. This book sold me on the premise. ""A mysterious coded manuscript, a violent Ivy League murder, and the secrets of a Renaissance prince collide in a labyrinth of betrayal, madness, and genius."" There was no plot. No suspense. No purpose. Just regret on the money I paid for the hardback."
1,Skip this one!,"I bought this book because 1) it was a best seller and 2) I got it for 30% off. Believe the negative reviews of this one. Slow, boring, and poorly written. I don't mind a ""look at me; I've been to college"" book if it's well written, but there's not one good sentence in this mass of drudgery that took, supposedly, six years to write. The plot is somewhat intriquing, but it is mishandled; the characters are removed by tense and emotion from the reader; the metaphors don't work; and, again, the sentences read like they were constructed from a computer thesarus builder rather than a writer's mind.I finished the book, not because of any sense of suspense--I could have cared less about ANY of the characters--I just wanted to see if it was 400+ pages bad. It was"
2,"Not as the ""Da Vinci Code"" or ""The Name of the Rose""","I've read this book in spanish and one of the reviews says that this book is as good as ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""The name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco. ""The Rule of four"" is far from being good as those novels. This book exagerates descriptions and details that have nothing to do with the plot. It loses focus by the middle of the book, and the end is very weak. It ends without addding something new or different. Both Ecos's and Brown's books are quite more better than ""The Rule of four"". You should read those first, and maybe compare them to Cadwell's."
2,Trying to cash in on the DaVinci Code,I heard a bit of buzz about this book and its similarity to The Da Vinci Code. I decided to pick it up and give it a shot since I enjoy the genre.I must say I was summarily disappointed. The subject matter is very obscure and most of the conclusions that are drawn seem to appear right out of thin air without much concrete thought or evidence to support them.My thinking is that a publisher came across a manuscript that seemed vaguely close to the Da Vinci Code and just put it out there and accentuate the slight connection to try and cash in on the popularity.
1,Father Fixation,"How anybody can call this book a ""good read"" is beyond me. The ""My father this...."" and ""My father that...."" repetitive sentences drove me to tears. IMHO this book is a poor 'first novel' and not worthy of the praise it has received."
1,Horrid writing,"I picked up this book only because of a comparison to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, which I remembered was a thoroughly engrossing read. This book does not come close. The writing is painfully sophomoric, the dialogue is pretentious and unnatural. Even worse, plot points are muddled and yet as a reader, I found myself not caring about the story, the mystery or any of the characters. The ending is a wink towards Hollywood as spoofed in Robert Altman's The Player."
1,Ick,I wish I had used the time reading this book for something more productive like waiting in line at the DMV.Was it not enough for these guys to graduate from an Ivy league school - they needed to impress the world with their command of the language and arcane literary knowledge?I can't remember the last book I read that had me skipping HUGE chunks only to pick up pages later having lost nothing in the process.
1,not worth the time,"Having read the DaVinci Code, I was eagerly looking forward to this novel. What a disappointment it was! The plot was confusing and not at all plausible. It seems that the two young authors are trying to show how learned they are, but I came away bored, although I have to admit, I read the book to the end. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,The epiphany of suck,This book is truly one of the worst I ever read.Believe the lousy reviews it is getting. I'd sell it but I do not want to be responsible for taking both money and time from the person who buys it.
2,Ideas,"The best part are the riddles, but a lot of this book is fairly poorly written and lacks any narrative enticements such as interest in what happens to the characters..."
1,A waste of trees,I started this book a few years ago. If I had gone beyond the mid-point I would have joined Rip van Winkle.Many errors among its bad writing. A possibly fairly (too many adverbs here?) good story was turned into a waste of trees.
2,Disappointed,"Do not compare with the DaVinci code! I heard a lot of hype about this book and was so excited to read it. I kept reading and reading waiting for something to happen, but it never did. I thought for sure that the slow build up would pay off in the end, but it does not."
1,an infuriating waste of time and money,"The hype is that this is almost as good as The Da Vinci Code, but not as long. I don't know about that: I didn't read Da Vinci. But if you want to waste your time reading about a couple of princeton kids trying to decipher a 500-year-old book and hearing about one's guilt dealing with his father's death and chasing his girlfriend, this is your book. I'm putting my copy up for sale on ebay. And before these two authors write again, I'd advise them to learn to be concise when allegedly writing a thriller. Let me know when the next John Le Carre book comes out."
2,Disappointing At Best,"The book has been touted as the ""Next Da Vinci Code,"" but please save yourself the trouble. I thought the book would be more about the Hypnerotomachia and unlocking the mystery, but that story seems to be a subplot to a story of relationships at Princeton. A boring read if you think there are any mysteries that will unfold..."
1,Trying too hard!!,"This was a very painful book to read and equivocally hard to finish. When I was in Art school, in one of my first classes; as I was learning figure drawing, I opened my first set of pastels. I was in awe of all the colors that were in front of me. In my enthusiasm to draw, I eagerly used most fo the colors in the pallette. As a result this was the worst drawing I ever did. This book reminds me of that drawing, trying to do too much and not conveying a single thought completely in the process. I hope these writers and hopefully their editors are more mindful of the following rule: ""Less is More"".I don't understand how people compare this book with Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code!! Everytime I see this book in my library, I get upset of the time and paper wasted on this book."
1,The Rule of Four,"I must agree with previous reviewers. This is a poorly written, overhyped bore. The authors jumped on the Da Vinci bandwagon and rode for all it was worth. Don't bother."
2,Not at all what I expected,"Although I did like the cryptic history/feel of the hypnertomacia, the book was very slow at times and did not lead te reader well. NOT A DIVINCI CODE TYPE BOOK, DO NOT BE MISLEAD"
3,"Good, but a bit confusing","This was a good book, but not great. I found it a bit hard to follow and it didn't pull me in like Dan Brown's books."
4,A fun book!,"I sure don't understand all the bad reviews for this book. It's a quick, fun read, with special appeal to those of us who are familiar with the Princeton University area. The characters are well developed, the history is interesting and I have no idea (nor do I care) if the history is accurate. I just wanted a good summer book that wasn't about politics or presidents and this was one of the best I've read in quite awhile! Read and enjoy!"
2,Disappointed,"Before writing about the book, let me tell you what kind of books I like. I like fast pace, page turners that does not dwell on each and every detail (i.e.-Jack Higgins, Robin Cook, John Grisham). This book is more for those readers who likes random details about the characters, locations, and activities.Now to the book review: Nothing happens in the first 1/2 of the book. It goes on and on about the book, school, and irrelivant character descirption. For example: what was the point of the paintball match which had zero bearing on the story. Or, three page description of Gil ex-girlfriend/s (trust me, there are more but two examples are enough). As I stated earlier, I don't need unnecessary details. However, if you are my opposite, then this book is for you. One more thing. on the cover, they compare this book to Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, but this is nothing like the DaVinci. I hope this review helps!"
2,We get the point.,"The authors have certainly made their point that theyare well-educated individuals, somewhat at the expenseof an entertaining story. The story line is sound andcould have been much more interesting but the textgets too bogged down with irrelevant descriptions.The authors have potential if they could just stoptrying so hard to impress the reader with theirintelligence and just let the flow of the story takeover."
1,Like something Eco would write... if he were illiterate,"I have to wonder if the reviewers who gave this 4 and 5 stars read the same book book I did. ""Expertly written"" is hardly the way I'd describe a sentence like this: ""Like a dog I'd kicked, the silence always seems to take her side."" Huh?Unfortunately writing like this is all too typical of The Rule of Four. While the plot is nowhere near as complicated or as interesting as something of Eco's or The DaVinci Code it's not bad. Sadly, a decent plot simply cannot overcome the horrors of the abysmally poor writing."
1,Very difficult to fathom,"Sorry , but:Among the worst books that I have ever read, or tried to read. I gave up half way through. Was like trying to understand the 60s Dungeons and Dragons game, with Callenge being the main theme. More like a final exam than enjoyable reading."
2,104 pages and waiting for something to happen...,"I am not enjoying reading about Princeton college traditions. If I wanted to read about that subject, I would have bought such a book. I guess I'll press on to the end, but man, what a boring ride. Princeton alumni will probably like it. Not sure why it's a best-seller, though. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,Have low expectations and maybe you won't be disappointed...,"Well, I was excited that it would be a great read and expected another Davinci Code. Without going into specifics, half the book was dedicated to life at Princeton and the other half was split between character development and the actual document/history.So, in summary, less than 25% of the book is dedicated to solving the mystery.Have low expectations and wait until the library gets a copy..."
3,"intelligent, well-crafted, but ultimately boring","I think this book suffers from anemia. It has great potential, but doesn't have the 'juice' to work. The book has so many good bits of prose, a well thought out plot, and a lot of really intelligent background information regarding the book they are researching. You'd think it would be a fantastic read. However, the book just doesn't work, doesn't gel. The characters don't make me love them, or hate them, or care about them at all. Something is missing.I do look forward to seeing the next book these two write."
1,Worst book I have ever suffered through.,"This book was mind numbingly, painfully, tediously boring. Rambling, philosophical discussions,uninteresting back stories and dull lifeless characters all come together to create a book worthy of a burning. A true waste of print and page. The book doesn't deserve 1 star, but it was the least of my options. I flipped pages in this book faster than any other book I've read to date. All in the hope that at some point the boring stuff would end and I would find a story. It never happened."
3,literate writing but lacking in suspense and pacing,"An interesting Ivy League coming-of-age story, well written from the standpoint of campus life and the mind set of the author, so at least he's written about what he knows.The rub comes in that on a mystery novel level it fails. It's not fair to compare this to the Da Vinci Code. Brown has been pumping out lean and slick commercial thrillers and fine-tuned his art, culminating it in the Code. If only he could formulate a dash of noteworthy prose now and then as these authors do consistently.You have to lay blame at the feet of the publisher for riding on coattails here, but that's business.A Jeffery Deaver mystery is a far more interesting suspense yarn, but no one ever said writing a good mystery was easy.If you'd like something more along the lines of homespun Americana mystery without the elitism, try ELVIS AND ME: A MYSTERY THRILLER by Weber instead. It's a coming-of-age wrapped within a mystery, well executed, and a fast read."
2,No Payoff,Promoted as this summer's DaVinci Code I was excited to read this new tome only to be disappointed in the meandering and uninspired story. I can see all the research that went into this story and at times you feel as if you are reading a theses paper. While at times there was enough to hold my interest as a whole I felt it didn't deliver the twists and turns promised.
2,"Formulaic, unispiring, boring, slow unfolding","The title says it all. This books is very poorly written, reader can't help but feel it came from a recent grad of a creative writing class: overuse of very cheap metaphores, formulaic plot, cheap shots, such as the nude party, very painfully slow unfold. Gave up after 3 chapters."
1,horrible!,"May I just say that whoever said ""Watch out, Dan Brown!"" is sorely mistaken. This book was not absorbing at the beginning, in the middle or at the end-and this book had some serious potential. And the ending-what was that??!! It was awful and there's not a lot more to say about it."
1,An insult to Dan Brown,How anyone can compare these two amteur writers to the great Dan Brown is an insult.The story is uncomprehensible and believe me I've read hundreds of books.A yawn from start to finish and I regret buying it.Give me Dan Brown any day!!!!
2,"SOMEWHAT BORING. yes, and. . . .","This book is NOTHING like ""DaVinci Code"" or ""Flander's Panel."" It is not even really a mystery- - -more of a coming-of-age story at Princeton U. I am so glad I didn't waste money on this and borrowed it from the library. Either borrow it or bypass it altogether. Not much really happens in it."
4,"Good plot, solid writing=Fine read","More intellectual than the Davinci code, which seems to have many raters up in arms. I find myself wondering what they expected to find in a book about a group of Ivy league scholars trying to piece together a 500 year old riddle. Did these raters think that the subject matter would be akin to a hollywood blockbuster brain teaser, I would hope not. I thought there were a few parts that dragged but I finished it in a day so they really were few and far between and kept my attenion long enough to do it. If you are looking for a complex subject that delves more into the background than an action narrative, pick it up. If you are looking for a fast pace thriller that stays on the surface and is just an adventure, stay away because you won't like this at all."
4,"Exhilarating, yet innocuous!","Caldwell and Thomason have done a fantastic job in presenting an ancient phenomena in half pop-half nerdy manner. The book has a few fisting moments, in a typical boy's life in college and early 20's age. I recommend this as a must read for all Dan Brown readers wanting a quick break, and to all unfamiliars to the ancient art history.Must read also for students out there getting and wanting to get any education in history and literature.Loved this book, and can't wait for more additions from Caldwell and/or Thomason!"
1,A Great Book For Insomnia,"I was REALLY disapointed in this book. The hook on the inside cover sounded so great that I just had to buy it.After reading the entire book, I'm still left wondering where the ~bizarre world of the Hypnerotomachia -- a world of forgotten erudition, strange sexual appetites, and terrible violence~ is in the book.I would have liked to have read more about the above and not so much about Princeton and it's Ivy League traditions/obsessions."
1,Trumped up - let down,"Unfortunately this book did not live up to any of the hype accorded it so generously on either the jacket or in publishers reviews. The story was slow and tedious and any plot momentum was abruptly cut off at the knees by poorly contructed flash back characterisations. Boredom was accentuated by drawn out descriptions of Princetons architecture, sewer system and intiation processes and the read left me thoroughly unsatisfied as a historical thriller or indeed any genre in which it tries to place itself. Follett, Shea and even Dan Brown are certainly much better value than this unfortunate first work. Steer clear unless you suffer from insomnia. (One star was for the potential of the story line which remained unfulfilled)."
2,small story big subject,"There were many times I found myself thinking ""you'd swear two people wrote this book"" such was the polarized nature of the writing. Then I'd slap my forehead. We alternated between the 'Porky's Goes To Princeton' style (one third of the entire book) - which laboured over every detail of campus life to the extent that I was certain floor plans and road maps would be included - and the academic study of the Hypnerotomachia itself, which was a vastly more intriguing tale even without the nailed on murder plots.Having achieved the aim of unravelling the books mystery, the story of the subsequent 10 years is then wrapped up inside the last 5 or so pages leaving me wondering whether either a sequel is in the offing or did they simply exhaust themselves describing each brick in the walls of Princeton."
3,Not bad.,"Given the recent interest in centuries old conspiracies, as sparked by the rather pedestrian DaVinci Code, I initially didn't hold out much hope that this would be any better. I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the fact that the entire novel took place on the Princeton campus, moving from libraries to museums to dorm rooms. It had its moments of excitement, and the subject matter was intriguing enough to keep me interested. My biggest gripe is that the ending was a complete disappointment in comparision with the rest of the book. It is almost like the authors had a self-imposed limit on how long the book was supposed to be, and, when they started nearing it, they tried to jam as much action and information in as possible in order to wrap up all ""loose ends."" A good book to pass the time on a trans-continental flight or while soaking up sun on a beach. Enjoy."
1,nothing like dan brown,"I believe this book is a best seller because some critic compared the cryptic puzzles and relation to historic events to the work of Dan Brown. This is nothing like it. It is boring, it has no real plot worth reading, and it draws to heavily on a puzzle that in reality no one could crack. Meanwhile all the references to literature and art weigh this book down significantly. It is not an easy, pleasureful summer read by any means...I didn't even finish it."
2,The Rule of Four,This is no Da Vinci Code. Not even close. I gave it a two because I reserve one star for books that are so bad I can't finish them. I had to see what the ancient text revealed and that was the only reason I finished the book. The only reason!I do not recommend this book.
1,Worst Book Ever!!!,"So the authors went to Princeton... Got it. Now where is the plot? Where are the Heroes? If I wanted to read 464 pages of what it might be like to go to Princeton, I would read the accessions and degree programs manuals published by the admissions office. This is by far the worst book I have ever read (Honestly couldn't finish it... Got of the way and just kept thinking ""why don't they just commit mass suicide and get it over with?"" Soooo Boring. Original, because the characters are so pathetic and shallow) Does not make one single attempt at the simple ""Who Done it??? Why??? Or why should we care???"" I absolutely hate this book, and hope that the authors are never allowed to write anything ever again. ZERO Stars."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I had high hopes, as I love this type of fiction. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the story that much.The pace was extremely slow. The mystery of the text that Paul and others were deciphering wasn't as gripping as I'd hoped. And lastly - and perhaps most importantly, since it was the main thing that killed my interest in the book - (possible spoiler, so see below)I found it improbable that all these renowned scholars - Taft, Stein, Curry - would pin their hopes and lives on the research paper of a 22 year old. It was almost embarassing. So much for being world renowned, if one has to steal from a college kid!"
1,Agonizing read,This book liked to kill me. So slow and without suspense. A real let down. Don't waste your time.
1,Incomprehensible,"This is an incomprehensible book that two Ivy League graduates have written about two Ivy League students trying to de-cipher an incomprehensible book - the Hypnerotomachia. The authors note often that many scholars gave up in frustration trying to figure out what the Hypnerotomachia was about. I suspect that many more people have tossed this book aside in frustration after trying unsuccessfully to follow the story line and find some reason to care about the main characters. Aside from the plot the book reads like it was written by someone who had spent too much time in an English Lit class, trying to ooze meaning out of every last word and phrase. Perhaps they have purposely written such an impenetrable book, hoping to create their own Hypnerotomachia that people will spend centuries trying to understand. Perhaps there is a secret hidden deep within its pages. If so, good luck to the ""gentle readers"" who try to figure this one out."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons in two days.I've been reading the Rule of Four for a week now, and it is so boring that I don't think I'll be able to finish it. Who will review this book so highly? What a waste of my money."
2,An Ok Read,If you were directed to this book based upon amazon recommendations you propbably have the same interests as I do. Don't waste your time on this one unless you just can't find anything else at the moment.
3,This is on the NYT best seller list? That's depressing!,"I'm impressed that these two guys were able to actually get a work published, but I've been more interested in stories from my creative writing class in college. The plot was nothing and really went nowhere. It was overly descriptive with hardly any action or forward motion in the story. The setups were easy to see coming and the characters had no subtextural life( if that's a word). I dabble in writing(nothing published), but I read a lot!! Whoever likened this to the works of Eco, obviously hasn't read them in while."
2,Don't Bother,"This story isn't about the solution to an ancient text (which would have made a good story). It is about four guys at Princeton. The book repeats itself over and over agian. Something shocking happens, like a murder, and it isn't mentioned again for a few chapters. The story even ends 100 pages before the book ends. The authors felt like they needed to give you more about the life of Tom after college. Blah, Blah, Blah. I gave it two stars becasue it could have been good."
2,Like an academic DaVinci Code....,"Welcome to Princeton and get ready to meet some of the class of 1999. Four seniors, Tom, Paul, Charlie and Gil are just weeks away from graduating. While most seniors are simply itching to live, Paul has yet to finish his senior thesis, about a mysterious 15th-century manuscript, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphil (which is a real book). It turns out our narrator Tom also has some ties to the book, for his late father was a Renaissance scholar who spent his life trying to decipher the embedded codes in its pages. It is the Hypnerotomachia who brought Tom and Paul together in the first place, but will it now drive them apart? Add some murder and romance into the roommate's quest to unlock the Hypnerotomachia's mystery and you've got a fast-paced thriller. It's a bit dense at times, and I did have to read some parts over and over to get them, and I also felt the story went on a bit too long and could have been chopped down. Not horrible, but not excellent either."
3,Who Cares!,"The book is beautifully written. I give it this much. I liked the coming-of-age story behind the main story of the ancient book of mystery, but when I finished reading the book I was like, ""who cares!"" The plot was extremely predictable. The riddles were contrived and the narrative was erratic at times.This book has been oftentimes compared to the The Da Vinci Code. I can assure you that the DVC is a much better book than this. It flows better with a faster pace.Read it at your own risk! I certainly do not recommend it."
1,Pretty God Awful,"After reading all of Dan Brown's books and still hungry for more, I picked up this title as it promised to be of a similar vein. Well, it wasn't. If the writers had bothered to spend as much time developing a story and interesting characters as they did going on and on describing Princeton Univeristy, it may have been a good read. As it stands, it's pretty much a love letter to Princeton that digresses occasionally to tell a poorly conceived story about uncovering secrets contained in a Renaissance era manuscript by a couple of boring undergrads with all the sophistication of a Hardy Boys mystery.Stick with Dan Brown or if you really like to read, Umberto Eco. Nothing here, but time you'll wish you had back."
1,Disappointing,"I must agree with a number of other reviewers here who have criticised this book for being schizophrenic... it doesn't really know if it's a literary thriller or a coming of age story, and suffers for the confusion. The biggest problem is that the coming-of-age story is banal in the extreme: poorly written and tedious. The literary thriller part is reasonably intriguing but you really have to slog through a lot of other meaninglessness to enjoy it. In fact, I skipped entire sections towards the end and didn't miss anything at all. The fact that the authors are young and intelligent really shows: the writing is by turns erudite (the thriller parts) and sophmoric (the personal parts). Overall I would not recommend this book; I desperately wanted to enjoy it but was hugely disappointed. By the way, I think this book merits 2 stars; I gave it 1 to bring the overall average more in line with what I think it deserves."
2,Dull,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I only read this because of my enjoyment of The Da Vinci Code. The mystery and/or suspense is completely lost with useless descriptions of college life. There are too many male characters, and most of the time it's hard to remember who they are and what they have to do with the story. The so-called romance is a ridiculous diversion that seems to suit no other purpose but to fill up pages and include a female. I had to force myself to finish this book. This is not a must-read."
2,Such a Letdown,"I saved this book for the holiday season. Curled up by the fire, I could hardly wait....good thing I had a stack of backups. If you went to Princeton (and are a man) I think you might get a kick out of it. The majority of the book is devoted to the development of the relationship of the two main characters during their time at Princeton undergrad. The mystery that had been billed as the compelling part of this book was lacking, uninspiring, and short. I had to force myself to keep reading hoping that it would be worth the effort in the end--it was not. There are so many books out there in this genre that will give you so much more enjoyment."
2,Exceptional Writing; too bad it wasn't about anything,"I went into this book from the coattails of Dan Brown, expecting better writing to accompany a worthy story-line. I was quite disappointed. For first-time authors, the pair's prose is beautiful, yet not verbose. They found the balance between Brown and Bronte. This is all good and well, except for the plot. I spent most of the book waiting for a good plot twist. I got one....in the last 30 pages of the book. If you want to read for pure language, pick it up; if you wish to be entertained at all, let it collect dust."
4,Good story; not enough mystery,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I think that the center of the work was advertised as being the unravelling of the mysterious book. That doesn't appear to be the situation, as we are treated to a tour of the Princeton campus and learning more than we would care to about customs and things at that school. I would have preferred to see more of a concentration on the mystery surrounding the book, and the characters involved in that, but when the authors did concentrate on the mystery, they did an excellent job. The language used was more than first-rate, and I'm always a sucker for good descriptive writing, in which this work abounds. This certainly isn't the ""DaVinci Code"", but it stands fairly well on its own."
3,"So, I bought the weeder.....","and I was quite surprised at the size of the box (smallish) when it arrived. Inside was the weeder and NO HANDLE. Very annoying to say the least. I am going to order the handle, but it would be a service to keep customers if the description made it more clear that it was a separate item to buy. Sheesh! --Elizabeth"
1,Might have been useful once...,"The book is fundamentally sound for a DSP class but the disk is worthless - NT won't even read it, much less run the software. If a prof requires this book, ask them to find a newer one."
5,Excellent,E.C. Sheedy is a force to be reckoned with. Her characterizations are complete and intriguing. I read her books out of order but they can stand alone.
2,"Okay, But Not the Greatest","This book is okay for what it is -- it tells you which keys to press and which commands to choose to perform different tasks in the Office 2003 programs.However, because this book is published by Microsoft, you don't get an objective, third-party perspective on the different software programs. The authors are never critical of the software itself. They don't steer you to competitors of Microsoft when going to a competitor might be the better choice. The authors don't describe unorthodox work-arounds -- the kind of things that save you time but aren't in official instruction book. I get the feeling this book promotes Microsoft Office 2003 as much as it describes how to use the software.Finally, a little humor would be appreciated by this reader. This book is pretty dry."
5,Best book for detailed info on the Fender Telecaster,"I read this book with great enthusiasm! It covers The Tele from the very begining up to 2005. With way more information/detail, celebrity players, vintage advertisement (as well as newer instruments) and beautiful photos than any other books printed almost two decades ago!This is a modern and thorough update to all Tele information. From the Telecaster's inception to the players that made it sing, it's all here in a very high quality format.If you love the Fender Telecaster and want the details covering six decades of droolworthy photos, specs and interveiws you will love this book!"
4,I laughed out loud!,"I read ""My Favourite War"" in one day and the book is superb. Christopher Farley's references to serious issues (e.g. racism, teen pregnancy) were spot on, as were his references to pop culture (I laughed out loud re: his references to Arnie's catchphrases!)."
2,"overbearing, bitter at the world narrator","Although there were some good points, it's obvious Farley is so angry at the world that I had a hard time getting through it. The only reason I didn't close the book was because I figured he made his main character so strong because he would undergo a transformation when he covered the war. He didn't even go to the war til the end of the book and then the whole schtick about the two women meeting up...puh-lease. What a shame to waste a funny personality with bigotry."
5,Great Read,"Wow! What a revelation on the Book of Revelation. Easy to read, understandable explanation of the end times and the new heaven and earth. If you need help understanding the Book of Revelation, this is a must read. billd"
5,Didn't know this Existed,"I really didn't know this album existed. I'm from Oklahoma and love me some Bootsy. 1976 I was in Germany USAF. So I was really surprised to see this product. I JUST LOVE IT. P.S. Met Bootsy and George Clinton in Florida back in 1977 while still serving in the airforce at Homestead AFB, FL. It was a real treat, me being a funk fan and all. Thank you so much."
5,1.2 patch fixes a lot of problems,"The new 1.2 patch, available online fixes a lot of the lagging problems that you read about in the reviews. Yes the hardware requirements are steep, but if you have a relatively new computer with a good video card and a broadband connection then I think you will find this to be the best game you've ever played. You can read the other reviews for more detail about gameplay, but buy the game, get the patch, get online and play!"
2,Don't bother if you don't have a GeForce4 or better.,"I played the demo before the game released and the framerate .... on my GeForce2. Then I finally picked it up because of all the hype and it still ..... UT2003, RTCW and Enemy Territory run super smooth on my system with the res to 1024x768. And from what I've seen they're more fun. And how can you have a WWII FPS with no blood? I don't know how this POS got game of the year. It's not all that. Pick up Wolfenstein or download enemy territory for the best WWII sim experience."
1,Does not measure up to Medal of Honor,Much to complicated to have fun playing. I enjoy Medal of Honor and thought this game would provide the same level of entertainment. NOT!
1,How is this game getting good reviews??,"I bought this game cause it looked like it would be so much fun to play with the variety of vehicles you could use. However, it is almost unplayable. The gameplay is horrible! The graphics and specially the sound are super choppy. The system requirements are huge but even with everything turned down it still plays horribly. Guess after playing Medal Of Honor maybe I was spoiled?? Its too bad cause there is so much potential with this game. Sadly, it was far from executed. My advice?? Save your money and buy Medal of Honor and the expansion pack coming out in November. You will not be disappointed!"
2,DON'T BUY,the gameplay it self is not bad but it takes to load even with a pentium 4 prossecer for missions
3,Wonderful stories nearly spoiled by weak endings,"Eric Frank Russell is such a great storyteller, I read his works even knowing that I am always disappointed by the inevitable weak ending. Mr. Russell's stories don't end so much as taper off, and it's a rotten shame because so many of his stories are gems.In spite of my complaints, this book is a must-read for any classic science fiction aficionado."
1,ONE OF THE WORST,"MIGHT BE LIGHT WEIGHT AND FLEXIBLE, BUT IT ALSO KINKS UP AND COILS UP VERY EASILY. YOU END UP WITH A BIRDS NEST OF AIR HOSE WRAPED AROUND YOUR FEET."
3,"great, but...","Been using it for house remodel. Great light weight! but watch out for any corners, mine made a sudden pop and it can't even be repaired because its made with polyurethane. So unless you are working in light duty area, be aware."
5,A Nursing Student's Best Friend,As a nursing student in Southern California I interact with Spanish speaking clients on a daily basis. Medical Spanish Make Easy has proved to be an invaluable tool in facilitating communication between client and careprovider. One more than one ocasion I have used this book to assist myself and my client to understand each other in a way that has prevented a problem in the future. I recommend this book to other students as well as other practicing profesionals in any health care field where you interact with spanish speaking clients.
2,"Good Start, Bad Finish","The book started off well, but it ended badly. The author presented himself as objective, but in reality he was obviously biast against Prophet Muhammad. In the beginning he was fair to the Prophet and was apparant that he did alot of homework for the book, at least in the beginning. But as the book went on, the author dove into speculation and conjecture w/o any solid evidence to back his claims. His attacks on Prophet Muhammad were baseless and showed his lack of knowledge on the Prophet himself, but only showed his biast against Islam which wasnt apparant in the beginning. I recommend Karen Armstrong's ""Muhammad"" It was much more fair and balanced on the Prophet than many western writers choose to be, propelling the myths of the Prophet Muhammad for thier mostly Christain audiences."
3,Just ok...,I liked the story in this book but it's lacking in passion and fire. It really makes it feel like the 50s or something when so many were closeted and not ready to be who they are.
3,Just This Once,"Enjoyed the characters very much. The research for this book was obvious and made the story interesting. Love reading KG MacGregor's books . . . always have, always will."
2,It's fluff :),"I really did enjoy this book, but was very surpised to find out that it did not contain a single citation. I don't know how a book like this, filled with statistics, gets into print without a single source listed. I teach introductory statistics and was hoping to get some ""fun"" numbers to share with my classes, but without the citations, it is unusable."
4,a premium paper...,"... optimizes the performance of my printing equipment, delivers premium text quality. at an affordable price. 24-pound paper provides a better ""feel"" and better durability."
2,"Slow, slow, slow","I thought this would be like the first Resident Evil movie, with a bunch of scientists trapped in a facility with zombies. Instead, you have a bunch of scientists talking, talking, talking as they slowly get sick with a strain of H1N1 virus. Has a nice conclusion, but you'll be tempted to hit the fast forward button more than once."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is an annoying book. On every page, the only text is ""honk honk"" with a picture of traffic. On the first page, someone bumps someone else, on the next page, that second somebody bumps another person. The pictures aren't different enough that a small child will realize what's going on unless you take a lot of time to explain it. The entire book is four pages long. Stupid!"
4,Mixed Experience,"I bought this CD a few years ago. It was manufactured in Belgium and contained a strange clear seal on the playing side. I discovered that it would only play in top loading CD players and not without interference. I had to have it professionally recopied and it cost me $25.00. I guess it was made to play on Region 2 DVD players.I now enjoy the beautiful voice I enjoyed as a child while living in a British colonial nation, with the BBC providing the inspiration. Since most of Jim's CD's are manufactured overseas clear the compatibility hurdle before purchasing."
1,A dream book,"After reading this very book, I had many scary dreams and nightmares. Very strange one's."
4,Good work,4 stars because there is a little difference - of about 3 inches. Otherwise a great product.
1,Very low quality cases,"Upon opening the package, one of the cases was chipped. The sides on all the cases look beat up.The stench the cases make can be headache inducing.Difficult to open - requires you to push heavily upon the edges of the case. Rather sharp.Not recommended."
1,Horrible,"I bought this item along with the 10pk twin storage cases. Shame on me for thinking Memorex would be good quality. Cheap cheap cheap! Really thin plastice sleeve, really thin plastic altogether. The smell when I opened the package from Amazon was horrible! Smelled like burned oil. Just awful! Not to mention I'm not even sure if I have the new or old packaging because the packaging I recieved doesn't look anything like the packaging on Amazon's website. I will probably be throwing these away as soon as I find better ones. I've already opened the packages to see if it was Amazon's box that smelled or the actual cases so I'm sure I can't return them now so... $30+ wasted. Please don't waste your money on these."
2,Cheap but workable,"Pretty cheap cases, but depending on what you are using them for, they'll work. Personally, I think you can get a higher quality for the price somewhere else."
1,Product Changed!,"Memorex changed the cases in this package, yet failed to reflect this on the packaging. I purchased them at a local Office Depot. It's the one with the patented hub that's supposed to protect your DVDs center. Anyway, the two packages I got are no difference in comparison to regular cases I've gotten with sets I've bought. I felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund."
3,Hmm....,"Its ok i guess. its not as good as their past albums. To tell the truth I thought this was the end of limp bizkit, but they saved their selves with the unquestionable truth, pt.1"
1,LB IS WORTHLESS,this cd is bad i cant belive i wasted my money buying this crap im so mad i bought this terrible cd-i feel so lame that i bought it-fred you must feel so retarered by making this terrible cd-YUCK this cd is bad-Pee Yew it stinks it stinks it stinks IT STINKS acually it SUCKS! Fred is a wannabe acually he is a never was HA
4,"are you a rock fan, or an actual limp bizkit fan?","this album is not bad at all. but it doesnt sound like limp bizkits old music. its not all just hard rock and shouting, not that i didnt like that. this album's tracks seem to have more emotion writen into them. there are a few that have the old bizkit sound, like ""head for the barricade"" and the one every one has heard, ""eat you alive"". so if you are an actual limp bizkit fan, than you will probably like this album. but if you just look for any kinda of music that is hard rock and shouting (which is partly me also), this probably isnt the album you want to buy."
1,LB FANS ARE THE DUMBEST HUMAN BEING ON EARTH!!!!,"Whats your problem guys?Why in the hell you are hearing this non-sense,big empty head,egoist,jerk,clown,loser`s CRAP.In fred`s songs he keep claiming that ""He is greatest,he did this he did that,kiss his ass etc"" and you people love it and give it 5 stars????It`s looklike that u LB fans either don`t have brain or you are being paid to hear this crap."
1,I HATE THIS CD!,I FREKIN HATE THIS CD I HOPE FRED DURST WOULD GET HIT BY A TRAIN SO HE WOULDS STOP MAKING THESE TERRIBLE RECORDS-PLEASE FRED JUST STOP AND MAKE THIS LIMP BIZKIT CURSE ON THE WORLD STOP NOW!!!! DONT WASTE YOOR MONEY ON THIS CRAP CUZ IT SUCKS
1,Limp Bizkit fails again,"This has to be the most phlasid peice of repugant work to ever be made by the group. and to top it off, they have ANOTHER COVER! Now i don't know about you all, but if i want to listen to an hour plus of some whiney sounding fool moan into a mic, i'll go do a poetry improv night. Why do people support him? Please people, stop buying horrible music, atleast listen to it first!"
1,Very LIMP,This album is crap in comparison the to the Chocolate Starfish.Don't waste your money. This band has lost it.
3,good cd,"i really never liked limp biskit but i love eat you alive and this cd is really good, i really like red light green light a good cd."
1,Why do they even try?,"Limp Bizkit should have stopped with $3 Dolla Bill Ya'll... the only decent CD they've ever put out. I can see why Borland left the band, this group is on a one way ticket to hell and Durst is driving the bus...Don't buy this CD, save it for something decent. Enough Said."
1,Boooring and very bad CD,"This album is extremely boring and long, at the 5 song you only got sleep.Don't buy this album if your don't get sleep."
2,Low-Point!!!,"This Limp Bizkit CD is a disgrace to their other great CD's!!! It pisses me off because they used to be the f'ing best with Significance Other and even Chocolate Starfish was pretty good but compared to this CD, this CD sux ass...The Best songs are probably ""build a bridge"" and ""eat you alive"" (thats why a gave it two stars) This is bulls**t!!! I was actually excited about this CD coming out!!!"
3,Good Album,"I Don't Know Why Everybody Wants to Hate Limp Bizkit. ""Results May Vary"" is a Good Album Not Their Best Work but Still Good. I Still Think ""Chocolate Starfish"" Was Their Best Work But This Album Works it's a Little Mellower Limpbizkit but Very Catchy Tunes, Fred Still Can Make Some Catchy Hooks. I've Been a Limp Fan Since ""Three Dollar Bill Ya'll"" and this was Before Faith and MTV and i Still Like them, I Think Once a Band Has Success then People Resent that and Begin to Hate. Same Thing Happened to the Smashing Pumpkins, The Strokes, The White Stripes, Korn, Staind and Many More Bands. I'm Willing to bet that While Linkin Park and Coldplay are Popular right now in the Next Year Everybody is going to Start Saying they Suck because they are no longer the little Indie bands that you first heard. But Whatever the Case if you Like Limpbizkit Pick up this CD and if you Hate Limp then just move on."
4,this is cool,just cuz its not ur kind of music doesn't mean you can dis it! i think its awesome!!! so if you don't like it stick to the classics.
2,mmmmmmm.....,"OK, where do i start? I first heard about Limp Bizkit after the success of 'significant other', which was a phenomenal record. They turned into a bit of a pop band with their 'chocolate starfish' record, gettin all these hit singles, yet i still gave them upmost respect. This album is a little hard to judge. I do give them some credit for trying, but really, the days of the bizkit are over!"
1,This is sad,More trashy rap rock from Limp Dyck. Why do they allow thesepeople to make albums? What kind of morons sign scrubs likethese guys? Just sad. Too bad the results don't vary any withthey're albums! They all suck equally.
1,BIG disappointment.,"I bought this album hoping that it would be better or at least something worth listening to like Significant Other, or Chocolate Starfish. But no, I was v. disappointed after listening to it. If I could, I would return the CD and get refund. There are probably only a couple of songs in this album that are worth listening to."
3,This album is significant other,"This album is what music concerns a little bit softer than Chocolate Starfish.Eat You Alive is a typical Limp Bizkit song as heard on Chocolate Starfish, but the rest isn't in that style. Gimme The Mic has an outline of Microphone Fiend by Fun Loving Criminals, while the chorus lines of Phenomenon comes from LL Cool J.Still this album has some favorites for me. Underneath The Gun is one of my favorites, that's a good song with good guitars. Build a Bridge is another one, and of course Behind Blue Eyes, which is as I speak the most seen video on the Dutch music channels.Furthermore, this isn't a cd what you would expect from Limp Bizkit, but overall it isn't a bad album. There has been quite a change since Wes Borland left, and it has consequences for their style. Maybe this is a test, and the next Limp Bizkit will be a second Chocolate Starfish. But then again, maybe this is why this album is called Results May Vary."
3,Worst rated album with ironically some of they're best tunes...,"In contrast, this album may sustain an overall lower quality however, it does have its highlights, including tracks like Almost Over and Lonely World. These tracks I can listen to over and over and never get tired of. Eat you alive rips and Behind Blue Eyes is great way to end the album. The album as a whole does have that Limp sound and IMO guitarist Mike Smith did a great job fulfilling his role. On that note however, the riffs on this album aren't quite as dynamic and it seems like the band couldn't reach its full potential without Wes Borland. Its known that Fred and the band wrote several tunes after his departure but when taking on Mike Smith he but put those to the side and wrote all new material upon Smith's entry. Perhaps some of those tunes could have been used in conjunction with some of the better moments of this album and who knows, it could've been as acclaimed as Significant Other!"
1,Pathetic,"This album is not worth your money, Limp Bizkit is supossed to be Rap Metal or something like that but to me this is just Rap and hip hop, Fred Durst is not an artist to me he's a great bussines man but not an artist. All he's doing is trying to make money with the ""fans"" So don't but this album is pathetic don't make the same mistake i made go ahead and but Slipknot, Slayer or even Korn is better than this. And don't try to look for some good album by Limp Bizkit cuz the past ones are just more of the same."
2,Results May Vary?!? You love it or you hate it.,"This CD is not good. It's tracks are terribly unoriginal and it just basically sounds strange. Limp Bizkit were never good, Fred Durst can't rap, face it. And Lastly, ""Behind Blue Eyes"", possibly their biggest hit on this album is a copy off a song by ""The Who"". Fred Durst cannot sing like Tommy. Its not even funny. For some real rock music check out ""The Who"", ""Led Zeppelin"", ""The Clash"", ""Black Sabbath"", ""The Red Hot Chili Peppers"", and all those classics."
1,what happened here....,"I used to b a limp bizkit fan, ""USED"" to be a limp bizkit fan, from songs like ""dookie"" or ""rollin"". Now, i dont think I will ever listen to fred durst ever again, because of this crap. To ME, the whole music sounds like an animal getting r@ped or something. Don't buy this album people, the one great limp bizket we thought we knew has been officially flushed down the toilet after this album."
4,O.K,Not there best work. Some of it does seem to be knocked off from something else like a little bit of Pantera. In all album isn't that bad.
2,Were's da old Bizkit.,"The problem with this album is the change of style. From the heavy guitar driven rap metal of their last album to the soft and uncharacteristic material on this album. Limp Bizkit have gone through a change which will dissapoint even the most hardcore of fans. ""eat you alive"" happens to be the only heavy track on the cd and one that represents the band's style. The rest is soft and unoriginal music. I strongly advise that this album be avoided. As newcomers can get a heavy dose of limp bizkit on their previous albums ""The choclate starfish and the hot dog flavoured water"" and ""significant other""."
1,Tru Essential Metal thugz!!!!!,ya know they gotz da goodz. thank goodness that poser wes borland or wateva hiz name be left. any way fred durst really cut down on da in your face i am so much better and give me my microphone deal. and really pulled off an incredible feet y'all. so on to da next thing. he finally took off his cap to show da bald spots. what a thug. ya know they have lost some of there touch. would give it more starz... if they could rap like me. other than that. only Parrrrk is better. peace out thugz from da westside
1,They should have stopped with the first album,I'm sorry...but Three Dollar Bill Y'all will forever remain their best album. Everyone knows that Wes Borland was the brains of the operation.
1,holy wow,"this cd is the worst cd that i have spent my hard earned money on.how is that idiot fred durst vise prez of a record label? i mean, i know these guys - fred durst can make some decent music, but freds dumbass whiney lyrics and his stupid voice totally sends this cd to the summit of crappiness. good job fred. i hope you are happy"
3,Not as bad as I thought...,"Well, first of all I was a LB fan like more than a decade ago, so it's weird to keep liking them because my music tastes are highly varied and more complex now. One of the trademark sounds of LB was Wes Borland guitar playing, and that's exactly what I feel when I listen to these songs, the absence of their trademark guitar. Other thing is the ballads, they're like too mellowy for a LB record, I'm in aggresion mode when all of a sudden Behind Blue Eyes, so mellow that makes me want to change disc or skip songs and reconsider why I bought this cd in the first place?... But it has enjoyable moments, maybe 70%, the other 30% is very boring. If you are a diehard you'll enjoy it. Gold Cobra was out last year and it is good record, you should check that out. :/"
1,limp bizkit... ok that was your first mistake,ok ill admit i used to listen to limp bizkit back when i was in middle school and it was cool thats what everybody listened to and it was catchy but i bought this album with high hopes and i kinda liked it at first but after two years and ive started to listen to alot heavyer stuff like lamb of god and trivium i realize how bad this album really is and how gay fred durst is and all the other stuff they made is absolutly horrible so if you really want some heavy a** metal that can penitrate your eardrums dont buy this crap with a bunch of untalented morons with a guy who sounds like a little girl trying to rap but ends up just sounding like a pot head but if your a hard core bizkit fan which i really dont think there is cuz anybody who is was prolly killed
3,Poor research equals a lack of reliability.,"Having purchased this book recently, I was dismayed to find two glaring and inexcusable errors in the very first paragraph of Mr. Kernan's book.First, the Oglala was not tied up alone on the dock (1010 dock). She was tied up alongside the USS Helena. Anyone who has read of the Pearl Harbor attack SHOULD know that.Second, and more importantly, the Helena, not the Oglala was hit by one NOT four torpedoes! Had four torpedoes hit the Oglala-Helena space, two things would have happened: the Helena would have been sunk at her berth (she was not) and the Oglala, being made of wood, would have been blasted into so many matchsticks.If this is the standard of scholarship today, I want a refund!"
3,This is not 5 stars,"Any realistic rendition of WWI would get my attention. The style of drawings are exactly the same as those great UK published war comics, mostly about WW2 and done in black and white.But those were clearly written for a youngish audience, with mateship, cor blimey, cobber, teufel, achtung dialogue, reflecting a rather juvenile approach to writing comics.Charley's war is done in exactly the same format. While I won't really fault the drawings, the simplistic plot and episodic nature of the tales is not literature. It does give one a chance to revel in nostalgia, but this is not WWI."
1,Missleading description - broom head only,If you need a broom this isn't it. It's just a broom head. Decription never states there is no handle included very deceptive listing.
5,"HUMOR, ACTION, SUSPENSE",This is a fast-paced novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I loved the quirky humor and the diversity of the characters.
5,Outstanding live album better than the reviews,"This CD has received some undeserved pans, but I just finished it for the first of many times, and it's outstanding. Cash is totally stoked, Linda Ronstadt is amazing, Roy Clark is at the top of his game, and even Foster Brooks is funny, and I wasn't even expecting him to appear. Yes, Cash had to sing some songs too fast and cut verses out, but that was pandemic on his live albums, so you accept it and love the best of the best. Top shelf stuff here."
2,hardly worth the Cash,"I haven't felt this burned by a CD in a long time. Only 7 of these cuts are actually Johnny Cash. And the songs that are him are certainly not his best versions. The comedy routines are DREADFUL. There is almost no info on the recordings or the concert .Perhaps the DVD is a better experience.With all of the great JC re-releases, new collections, and concerts coming out put this one at the bottom of your want list."
3,Reads like a long narrative with no ending,Even though I gave this book a three star rating I still look at it as a book with little influence on what John D. Rockefeller really did as a entrepeneurial business man. His life is one that captivates the mind and soul. He's business tactics were ruthless and harsh but Rockefeller always got his point across and took care of those that needed the help. Mr. Nevins wrote a good detailed account of everything that went on in Mr. Rockefeller's life but he missed some major points and gave bad insight on what Mr. Rockefeller was actually trying to do.
3,I wanted to like it.,"I had read the story of Logan and Jesse where Kee comes into the story along with another little boy that he refer to as his cousin. I hoped this would be as good as that story by that same author, but the title was just as it said, because other than his being a hero as a child, which doesn't count here, I guess I expected to have several heroic adventures with different situation woven into this one book. It was just not my thing, but the cover picture of a grown-up Kevin(Kee)is a good one."
2,Good calculator--but I would save the money for a better one,"Well....this calculator has many features for middle school students, but really is it worth it ? If you're in middle school, then you probably won't need such an expensive calculator, because you really don't need to use a calculator to graph. If you are learning graphing, you might not be able to use it one the test. In my opinion, I would buy one of those cheaper plainly scientific calculators. They get the job done and they are cheaper. But, if you really want to get a graphing calculator, I would suggest the TI-83 plus. Right here on Amazon.com, it being sold at $86.99, CHEAPER than this one and with more functions!!!!!!"
5,Love the Cookbook!,"I have searched hi and lo for this edition. Although it is a replica of the original, it is identical to my mom's that I grew up with and have envisioned having a copy."
5,Haven't I seen this before....?,"The Mihoshi special was very good, but there was just one problem. It was too similar to Journey Through Time and Space Adventures. Ayeka was again, supposed to marry Tenchi, and that's the last thing most of us want. I didn't like the fact that Washu was the bad guy. I happened to have loved the episode but I just expected something new. Every TENCHI fan should try it. It's a cute episode and it's definatley worth watching. (At the end of the video you see a few seconds of the Tenchi TV music video in English but I personaly like the Japanese version a lot better ^_^)"
1,Meh,"First off...the Pink Spiders are in no way punk. Secondly, this music is so polished and poppy it lacks any type of genuine feeling to it. Third, the whole ""pink"" gimmick can only take you so far...even Pink had to change her hair color.I guess for fans of pop music this band will make you excited, but for me it just makes me ill."
5,Classic McKenzies fashion and better Produced.,"If you are a McKenzies fan then you will not be disappointed by this CD. It leads off with the song ""Smokin' Bowl"" and it was with the one song I knew I wouldn't be dissappointed. Of course, how can you be with these Canadian, kilt-wearing, punks?With songs like ""I Hate My Band"" ""10,000 Shots"" and ""Bugger Off"" and lines that are throw backs to Monty Python- ""I used to be a lumberjack, and I'm okay with that/ I wore suspenders, little panties and a bra"" (""Pour Decisions"")- Their humor is blended well with the seriousness of their Scottish, Punk and Canadian roots. And if you're wondering they do have the correct balance of Bagpipes and guitars on this album, their previous CDs usually seemed to lean more on one than the other, but I believe this one has balanced them out without outdoing one or the other.It's good at least one band can save Canada from Avril Lavigne and Simple Plan shame."
3,Too short,"This book is supposed to have Thousands of Miles Worth of Hands-On Games and Activities, and yet it is only 18 pages long. This book'll last you for less than 100 miles before you get bored of it, I reccomend Kids Travel instead."
4,Fun game,"This game is definitely fun and great for parties. All the songs rock and the graphics look cool but it's even better if use wii component cables. I would recommend this game if you're looking for fun, new dance moves or simply to have a good work out!"
2,fun but buggy,"I would love this game but for the fact that it locks up in the middle, or sometimes early in the game. I've found if I reset it will sometimes start back up but sometimes I have to reset 3 or 4 times in an hour. The first game we got we sent back because it would suddenly start scrolling thru the selections so fast it was simply a matter of pushing the A button and taking what came. And sometimes it wouldn't accept any selection.The replacement worked better but still locks up which is really annoying as I set aside the time to get some exercise and end up repeatedly standing there waiting for it to boot up again.Anyone else have such problems - and how do you deal with it?If it would just work as it's supposed to, I'd give it a rave review, but the frustration overcomes the positives sometimes - like tonight."
3,"Enjoyable Game, Horrible User Interface","Although game-play is frenetic and enjoyable, I find the menu system difficult to control. My biggest request is the option to abort a song once I have started, as I often find that the difficulty level has been accidentally changed without my noticing. Currently, I have to either let the song finish, or reset the Wii."
4,Energetic Fun,Stimulating and fun for preteen and teen grandchildren. Easy purchase and fast delivery made gift giving easy.
3,Dancing,"bought this game for my wife to help her stay fit. she found the game to cumbersome and not easy to use. the item was new and was delivered on time. great service, poor game."
4,Definately gives you a workout!,My daughter is pretty good at this game. It might take me a while to get used to this one. One thing for sure is that it really gives you a workout!
5,Dance Dance Revolution is a Big Hit in our House,"This is a great ""game"" for the Wii. It has lots of dance choices for the beginner right up to the expert! This game provides great exercise for young and old alike. You can work up a sweat and burn body fat!"
3,DDR for th kids,"The product is a bit hard for the kids to use. They are 12 and 8. Once they figure it out, it seems to be fun, but they don't use it as much as anticipated. Adults seemed to be having more fun and looking sillier than the kids."
4,Exercise,"Fun for all ages. Mat is pretty durable, moves around a bit on a carpet but that is expected. Mat is very responsive on a carpet with extra padding.User friendly menu and good graphics. Incorporate arm movements with the remote controls."
3,Not what I expected,Seems like a cheaper version of a better game. Pretty bad songs. Not too motivational as far as dancing to the right tune goes. I think the kids enjoy at least jumping around due to the game play.
4,Excellent! Good Exercise~,I had played the DDR game about 10 years ago when it first came out of Play Station. This Wii version is similar to what it was 10 years ago except now my hands need to move as well! This is a great full body exercise for those of us who rarely have time to go to gym and are tied to the couch every night. I would suggest getting two dancing pads as dancing is more fun when you are with someone. The minor complaint is that the song selections are just so-so. I wish there are a lot more good songs. Overall I highly recommend this game!
5,A Gift,This shirt was a gift for a friend who wears it more often than any shirt they own. To me that statement says it all.
5,Big improvement over rubber hoses,I've been using one of these hoses on a job for the last six months. It's spoiled me so bad I have to buy one of my own now. It is lightweight and slick so it stays out of trouble without snagging on things. The next best thing to having a cordless tool.
1,not good.,"This is one of the most boring text books I have ever read. I was assigned to read this book as a college student in an Introduction to Rhetorical Reasoning Class and I couldn't understand a word. As an introduction class I figured the reading would be somewhat stimulating, but it completely turned me off to the rhetorical communication field. It was very repetitive and felt at times, that I just wanted to skip a large portion of the reading."
4,Great for historical overview.,"Excellent historical document. Absolutely authentic. The liner notes are exceptional. But, like much music of this vintage, recording quality is such that it's better for studying than listening enjoyment. The sound of often out of tune barroom pianos recorded through soup cans is cool for awhile, but it wears on the ears."
4,"A short, yet reasonably thorough book on function theory","For purposes of this book, the term ""distributions"" has the following definition.By `distributions"" we understand the linear and continuous functionals on the space D of the functions that are of indefinite differentiability and that have compact support.Therefore, the book can be considered one on function theory, with two main sections:*) Functional theory of distributions*) Algebraic theory of distributionsOperations performed on the distributions include:*) Products*) Translation*) Convergence*) Fourier transforms*) Laplace transforms*) Translation*) Differentiation and integrationThis book is a short, yet reasonably thorough development of the operations that can be performed on functions that satisfy the premise of the definition."
2,"At home ok, in car not so good","I bought this item over a less expensive ""off-brand"" thinking it would have better performance in the car. It worked great at home and my kids had a blast snuggling up and watching their favorite DVDs. In the car it was less than desirable. Two seperate units (which I've returned) had the exact same problem: the power jack connection at the unit is loose and the power flashes on & off if the unit is moved even the slightest. A big problem in a moving vehicle, especially with the coiled power cord."
4,Great Product,"Unlike the other nursing pillows that I found, this pillow is flat instead of contoured. This allows baby's head to lie flat at the same level as breast. Makes getting a good latch easy. I no longer have to rig towels or blankets under baby's head. Wish it was a little larger..other than that great."
3,you get what you pay for,I breastfeed my baby and this pillow helps bring the baby closer to my breast but it's really way too soft to provide real support for the baby. So I end up still having to hold his head. I prefer my boppy pillow but this one was half the price of the boppy and like I said it does provide some assistance so I keep this one in the livingroom and the boppy in the bedroom so I always have a pillow handy at feeding time.
3,Not bad...but definitely for fans only,Short but sweet review...it's not a bad record but it seems like the band is going through the motions.It's an upgrade from Prodigal Stranger(I had such high hopes from that LP)but it is nowhere near the classics>The last great Procol Lp was Grand Hotel.Get it but don't think this is gonna have a tune as good as Wreck of the Hesperus.
3,"Must buy, but not their best effort","I don't want to repeat the prior reviews, but these are my original thoughts. First, it wasn't until the 7th song when I felt the band got on track. Until then, the songs sounded bland, and similar to the style of the Police. You will notice a difference in the songs. Keith Reid picked up a little anti-capitalism in the past dozen years too, it seems to me.The final song, Weisselklenzenacht, doesn't sound like Repent Walpurgis (my second favorite Procol song), but the parallels are obvious. Both are purely instrumental, both are at the end of their respective albums. Weisselklenzenacht has strains of ""Air on a G String,"" the bass theme in AWSOP. I loved it, and it is worth the cost of the CD by itself!You must buy this CD, but don't expect too much from it."
4,"All tracks on ""The world has made me the man of my dreams""","All of the tracks on the release are included in her full-length release ""The world has made me the man of my dreams"" (2007)."
5,Sweet Story!,"I just read this to my children before bed tonight. What a sweet story about an old man who still likes toys.The story is sweet and easy to read, yet this is a ""reader"" type book consisting of 3 chapters. It's short enough to read to young children, but long enough for new readers. My 7 year old helped me read it tonight. He is very good at reading and this book is too easy for him. But reading is reading.I would recommend this for children of any age. But if it is to be read by a child, I would say it is 1st grade level reading.We will be reading more Mr. Putter and Tabby books!"
1,where are the samples to listen to?,"For the most part, amazon includes the samples to listen to the product. Why are there no samples for the Afterglow cd's? So disappointing... Is there any chance at all to find the samples later on to listen to them, please?"
3,oversimplified version of diablo/divine divinity,"The production values of this game or not quite up to par with that of other games. This is what makes this game somewhat boring/unattractive. It appears to also be amazingly short. Total of 21 maps maybe? and each takes about 10-20 minutes to complete. Only place you can save apparently is at the map, and there is only one shop in the game (again at the center of the map, which you can only reach by conquering several map areas before reaching it). This game has more of the look and feel of divine divinity or possibly prince of qin than diable (although any of these games are much better than this game). The weapons are for the most part scaled down versions of what you can find in diable. And the bosses only talk to you in screen.. no voice or nothing. The story is also somewhat lame. There are a whole lot better RPG games out there. There is no reason to buy/play this, IMO, unless you have nothing else to do."
1,Could be better,"I have two problems with this pitcher:1. The more you use a filter, the slower it becomes. One filter lasted 4 months, another lasted 2 weeks - not sure why, but I just replaced it because I couldn't wait.2. When the upper compartment is filled with water, you essentially can't use the pitcher, because the unfiltered water runs out over the top. For all the times I've spilled water all over my kitchen counter - one star."
3,Its ok,"Its better than nothing. The good things I notice is that it does filter water. Thats pretty much it. As far as how long the filter lasts, I would say 3-4 months. The main problem I have is having to refill the thing. In fact, its pretty much the reason I want to switch to the faucet mount. You pretty much have to refill it every two glasses of water if you want to keep it full."
3,PUR Water Pitcher,I bought this to use at my desk at work. I fill up the top with crushed ice and then add about 16 ounces of water and let it melt and filter through to make somewhat cool water. But the water seems to filter through this too quickly and I usually have to pour the filtered water into a glass and then pour it back into the top to be filtered again before it tastes good. I also have the larger size that sits in the fridge and I think it does a better job of filtering even though it uses the same filters as this pitcher.
1,major flaws in useability,"The pitcher lid only comes off with force and then flies off - it's not an easy lift off. I thought it was just a matter of getting used to when I bought this but - 2 months later, and it's the same. After reading similar reviews I was forced to concede it just was designed extremely poorly. Now i am trying to replace the filter - (the light telling you when to replace is very useful) and the old filter won't come out! I've tried coercion and force and even had a few friends try their luck when they come over - nada. I remember my old brita - none of these problems , the filter slid right out. The Pur as a pitcher filter is fine but the design flaws almost make me wish I had never bought it. I've been using the old filter now just cause it refuses to come out. Poor show, Pur."
4,Decent product,"It was inexpensive...and made pretty well and has held up over the last few months. Nothing fancy, but it works!"
3,Fairly good remixes,"The original song is great, full of emotions and depth. But the remixes r pointless.The dance mixes do not incoporate Brian's vocal well into the dance beats. Surely no one is going to play this song in clubs. The hip-hop/R&B remix lightens the tense mood that was in the original version, which is a shame, coz the mix turns out to be neither emotional or enjoyable."
3,Not his best......................,"I bought this cd to hear ""Messin' with the Kid"" which I think was covered so well by the Blues Brothers. Junior Wells is so good that there are at least a half dozen cds that you should buy before this one. ""Hoodoo Man"" is stunning for one. Is this particular cd bad, no, it's just not stellar like some other cds of Junior's."
3,surprise!,"A clever and entertaining look at the creation of ""entertainment"". The creative process is given a somewhat lighthearted once over in Mike Leigh's heartily interesting Topsy-Turvy. Creatively stymied and at a point of wanting to go in different directions creatively, Gilbert and Sullivan find themselves desperate to come up with a hit. Gilbert, at his wife's insistence, attends a Japanese expo, and this leads to the fabulous new, ornate idea of The Mikado. The film is lush, fantastic and spectacular. Another reviewer stated that the film might come off as artsy and pretentious to some, but it does actually deliver with a great deal of ""heart"", and Leigh's characters always offer depth and life enough to sustain any story."
5,Masterpiece,"This is a landmark movie in that it is the first ever costume drama that does not romanticise the events it portrays, i.e. Merchant Ivory, etc. It depicts people in late-Victorian England doing exactly the same things we do: hold meetings, ask for pay-rises, go to the dentist, etc. In that way, and in the amazing attention to detail, the audience is actually taken back to London in the 1890s. Another important thing: You DON'T HAVE to be a G&S fan to enjoy this movie. The music, although prevalent, takes second place behind the story-telling. You can ignore the music and look at the wonderful scenery. Please see this movie. You'll never want to see another Merchant Ivory film again."
2,Expecting more,This was highlighted in Wall Street Journal and could not get it as a rental. It is slightly boring.
5,The Making of the Mikado!,"If it weren't for the one gratuitous scene in the French whorehouse, this is one movie that you could show to a class in English Lit. It is a well researched, well written movie about the beloved team of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Sometimes funny, always interesting--and the music is very well done. All of the actors are actually performing their own music. It is excellent!"
2,One of the most BORING films of 1999,"Although I am a big Mike Leigh fan and can appreciate the art of Gilbert and Sullivan, I cannot recommend this movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theaters around 6 months ago and to tell you the truth--the only thing I can remember about it is howing boring it was. It seemed to drag endlessly and for an almost 3-hour film--that was way too long. I usually don't care what the Oscars or the British Oscars do, but keep in mind that neither of them nominated this movie for Best Picture. If the British Oscars didn't nominate it--and this movie IS British--then I think that's saying something about this movie."
5,No doubt about it...Luce rocks!,"If you want a CD that you'll never remove from your CD player, this is one of them! The sound, the vocals, it's all amazing. I've seen Luce play live quite a few times now and I never get tired of them. They just sound great! Pick up their CD and get hooked! Especially liked the bonus tracks left out on the last album before they had a label...""If I Had the Wind"" and an absolutely great song, ""Waiting"". You need to get this CD!!"
4,A good book to read on Jewish ethics,"A friend of mine was reading this book as part of a Jewish adult education group and suggested it; it's pretty good, especially with ethics being all the talk these days."
3,"Um would like the good ol days, what happened","I usually don't write reviews for cds, but when I picked this up and popped it in hoping to hear some stuff like 3 DOLLAR BILL, I was let down, however this cd is different and it is alright, except I wish certain songs(red light, green light) were done better ( when every other word is baby it sounds like nails on a chalk board) Fred repeats himself too much and it sounds ridiculous. Now don't get me wrong he has some talent and I love covering some of his songs, but even I can be a better MC then this man who waste his talents on his depressive feelings. Bring back the rebel that is Fred instead of this little boy. The CD is alright at best, but all I gotta say is bring back the old days of Family Values 98' and 3 DOLLAR BILL!"
2,Not Much Changes with Bizkit,"I was never a Bizkit fan though I've listened to the music before and of the 4 albums , well they are all pretty similar lyric wise and in the song arrangements . Results may Vary has some of the better guitar work simply cause there seems to be more emphasis on it and Fred has decided to get back to more of a rock feel , still though this album really doesn't break any new ground for Bizkit and doesn't totally stray from rap ( unfoutunatley ) . Anyway If you're a LB fan it's worth it to get this if you aren't an LB fan you should probably stay away , I am ."
3,Sell Outs,"Personally I think the album is alright, atleast it's something closer to the first album which totally rocked. As far as I'm concerned all the albums that came after Three Dolla Bill Ya'll sucked and they showed me how bad a talented band can sell out. I give the album 3 stars, because well, it seems every band is adding something acoustic to their albums these days, a little late on that one Fred."
3,Limp Bizkit...going down.....,"I really used to like Limp Bizkit it seems that they have been kinda going more mainstream with each cd release. They definatly have more MTV material on the cd....With the loss of Wes I wasn't expecting much for this new cd. Amazingly they still obtain the ""Limp Bizkit"" sound. Freds lyrics are pretty weak compaired there older releases. All in all this is a cd I will listen to for a week or so then put on the shelf."
3,"ITS NOT THAT BAD, AN AVERGE CD WITH A FEW GOOD SONGS","I agree that this is not the GREATEST CD that they put out, and i agree that FRED is a little controlling school girl. Yet OVERALL i do not think that they put out a horrible products like everyone else seems to think. Red Light Green Light feat. Snoop is pretty tight song along with Gimme the Mic and Eat you Alive. So to recap, the album is worth listening to, don't discount it just because everyone is a hater."
1,"Retire......please, for our sake.","You should be able to pick up this one in the $4.98 bin soon enough. It's crap. Once Wes left, it was all over. Fred Durst has confirmed his place in the list of celebrities we just wish would go away....Tonya Harding, Monica Lewinsky, etc. Even Tyler knows this."
3,Its got its Moments.,"Most of the songs are Tolerable..BUt Over all its a very weak and dissapointing album.""Gimme The Mic"",""Eat You Alive"",Behind Blue Eyes"",""Phenomenon"",and ""Head For The Barricade"" are the Best tracks on the album.This album was just missing something....And I think his name is Wes Borland.But I will say...they do put on a kick ass Live show.As Far as The other songs on the album they are very weak.I gave it 3 stars to give them the benefit of the Doubt."
2,dissappointment,"im a big limp bizkit fan and was really anticipating there new album ..... to bad it sucks , eat you alive is a catchy song after that the cd puts you to sleep , limp bizkit is suppose to get you up and pumped not to have acoustic songs and put you to sleep ..... we need wes back"
1,Get Iron Maiden's Dance of Death instead,"This is pure rubbish. I mean just look at the art cover. Not to talk about the horrible single ""Eat You Alive"". If you want to get a real Metal album, you should get Iron Maiden's latest album Dance of Death instead of this limp metal."
2,LimpDick Sucks Now,"Wow this cd was weak, I mean starfish was way better then this cd even though it wasnt that good. LimpDick has to just stop making music its over YOU SUCK, and get a wig or something yo bald head is nasty."
1,"Fred, I'm begging you to go away and leave us alone.","Fred, you arrogant, no talent cueball. Stop polluting our precious air with your inane rants. The sound of me crushing a baked potato on my forehead is more appealing than your ""music."""
1,"Teenagers hate it, trust me","Wake up and smell the hot dog flavored water people! I'll say it up front I'm a woman, basically middle-aged (I can admit it only through gritted teeth). And while the stork hasn't dropped off a bundle of joy for me yet (hope, hope!), I do regular babysit a friend's teenage daughters. They keep me up-to-date with what is going on in the music biz, and I've been told time and time again that Limp Bizkit is passe (my word, not their's, but you get the picture). And yes, I have heard the whole vile cd, with left me with a bad farting problem. 1 star? Please, I'm being extremely generous to these foul mouths."
1,"terrible, the reviews dont lie, and im into everything","first song was ok, but then you will be treated to a nice album of droll 70's rehash crap, this album pissed me off so much i gave it to a friend, No wes, no heavy, not worth it"
1,Worst Album Ever Made,"This cd is, by far, the worst album I have ever heard. This band somehow has gotten worse with every album release. If this album was instrumental, it would not be completely bad - this is not the case. My beef with this album is Fred Durst. His lyrics and voice are complete garbage. This album is proof that he has no talent/song writing skills. This band's 15 minutes are up. I'm definitely returning this album due to it being defective in terms of the quality of music on it. I feel like I should have been paid to listen to this album. This album deserves zero stars."
2,How can you call this crap amazing????,"Holy geez these lyrics are so awful. I'm so sick of hearing about beating people up and the word BABY 53 TIMES a FREAKING song. Fred rushed through the lyrics to meet a deadline and it shows. The music is terrific. It has depth and variety, just well written. But the lyrics destroy it. Maybe it's not Wes they should've kicked out of the band..........."
2,Im just not feeling it.,"Ive been a hardcore Limp fan since Significant other. I even stuck around during that Chocolate Star Fish thing, but like I said, Im just not feeling this album. I started listening to Limp because how unique and hardcore it was and this album just doesnt deliver that. It almost sounds like Coldplay without the piano. As bad as his album sucked, Im sad to say: I miss Wes. My suggestion...just listen to someone elses and make your own decision, thats what I did."
2,High failure rate,"I ordered four players for the family at Christmas. I've had to send two of them back because they would not play CD's produced by the factor, or burned with WMA or MP3 files. I know it isn't the CD's because they will play in the other two units. The working players all types of CD's I've put in them. I haven't had problems with remotes or skipping and the radio works very well. I would give 4 stars to the working units (The read out is hard to read 40+ year old eyes.) and 0 stars to failed units for an average score of 2 stars."
2,Software doesn't work with Windows XP,"Very compact and the single USB connection (including power) is very convenient. However, the software refused to run on 2 separate machines (both windows XP). With PhotoStudio it complains about not bein able to open the twain device. With Photoshop, it complains about missing DLLs. I did eventually get the scanner to work with VueScan but that costs $50, nearly as much as the scanner itself!I didn't do a thorough test but my impressions were that the image quality was ok but not brilliant. A bigger problem was that the documents need to be absolutely flat on the scanner or the image will be out of focus. It was fine with single sheet documents but with magazines, books etc. the results were very blurred.The scanner has gone back to the shop."
1,Disappointed with the Canon Lide 60,"I was very disappointed with the Canon Lide 60. I personally thought the pictures were not the quality that I had been used to and I thought that it was hard to get used to. I had had a Visioneer 7600 for several years and I am going back to Visioneer. Also, I expect to get a manual with my scanner, not have to go on line every time I want to find out something."
4,Ryobi AP10 Planer adjustment gauge,"Item does not come with instructions on how to use it to get the proper blade adjustment. However, if you have a copy of the Owners Manual or can find one online, a very difficult task, the procedure is explained therein and is really quite simple. The item is great and will set the blades to the proper length so they cut appropriately."
4,"Great story, but it's a story HE can learn from.","I won't say he deserved it, because no one deserves self- amputation, but Aron Ralston really does need to take it down a gear. I think his accident in Blue John Canyon serves as a reminder of mortality, both to the readers, and hopefully to himself. It was a sign that he needs to slow down. Nonetheless, I admire his dedication to his dream. In today's society, so many people aren't working to live, but living to work. I enjoyed how his coworkers at Intel were amazed that he would leave a great job for the wilderness. I can't say I would have done the same thing. It is a beautiful story. He is lucky to have such great relations with his family. One can tell, by reading the story, that he is very content with his life."
5,"Compelling, riveting tale of survival and human strength","I agree with the last reviewer. The fact that Aron Ralston used poor judgment, i.e. hiking alone and not telling anyone where he was, only makes his story more compelling. Hasn't everyone made a huge mistake that leads to a painful, regretful plight?Calling the media sensationalistic,in this instance, is just plain silly--amputing one's arm in order to save one's life IS a sensational, highly unusual event. I don't think the media or Aron is making it anything more than what it was. The charge that Aron is self-promoting is just as ridiculous. After you read the book, you will see that Ralston is a humble person with great integrity and strength. He is simply telling his own, true, unbelievable story. Bottomline, this book is incredibly well-written, moving and not to be missed."
4,Excellent fast read. Well written,"Just finished this book. Aron's survival of entrapment can be attributed to his methodical, disciplined thinking. This book gives insight into his past experiences (victories and mistakes) in his short yet passionate mountaineering life and how they came into play to survive his entrapment.I close the last page being very encouraged and inspired by his incredible expeirence. Great writing (can't believe Aron wrote this by himself - it flows so smoothly) and incredible photos. A good gift for someone recovering from surgery or just going through tought times. It teaches you to value your relationships and make them right when you can - for tomorrow may be too late. Thanks Aron."
5,"A Compelling, True Story",You'll be inspired by this true story of defeating overwhelming odds of survival. What would you be willing to do to yourself to live?
5,Need inspiration - read this book,"I saw Aron's story on Dateline NBC. When it was mentioned that he wrote a book and it just came out I knew I had to read it. Aron has a very unique point of view - he faced death multiple times, not only in his life but with this one incident. His will and strength, not only physical but mental, allowed him to beat the odds and survive when the end looked all to near. Reading this book was very inspirational. It makes the little things seem trivial although they are important because those things are part of life. Aron had a lot of neat stories to tell about his outdoor adventures. I won't give much away but one of my favorites is where he is being chased by a bear. Read this book, you will be happy you did!"
3,Interesting Read,"Not a bad read though I found myself reading about the first 30 pages, skim-reading the next 250 and then reading the last 70. In short - interesting beginning and end but a bit too padded out in the middle."
3,"Not a bad read, but not dazzling, either.","This book is pretty good, but not spectacular. Honestly, I thought that the detail about previous adventures was a bit boring. I also thought he could have trimmed down the number of friends' names listed in the book. These details bored me because I live in Ohio. I dont have a clue about which mountain is what in which part of Utah or Colorado or New Mexico. The internal struggles of the author were pretty good. I like that he was candid about what he learned about himself. I have recommended this book to others, and I will continue to do so."
5,"Amazing book, amazing man","We saw the movie version of this with James Franco at Christmas and it was very good. I had to read the book and it was amazing. You were with Aron in the crevice, but you were also with him as he did solo climbs in horrible weather, shared his joy of the outdoors, and laughed and cried with him. Would recommend this book to anyone and this is going to be my 2011 birthday gift to all of my nieces, nephews, siblings and parents. A book everyone should read."
1,It is a waste of money,"I ordered this product because it claims ""Solid, durable nylon spoon with silicone covering, heat resistant to 600 degrees F."" I did not pay too much attention to a negative review. The spoon can not handle heat at all. The edge of spoon spoiled after 1 week and lots of crumbs came out of it. It looks very scary."
5,Perfect for non stick cookware and most everything else.,Just what I was looking for; combination of non stick and heat resistance. Works great on my non-stick pans and for stirring large quantities without fear of breakage.
5,I read this book in less than one day!,"A friend handed me this book last night around 8 PM. I read the first chapter then, and the rest of the book today. It's now 3:30 PM and I'm dying for the next book! The characters were easy to picture and fun to get to know. Lots of sexual tension with just the right touch of vulnerability. A great read!"
2,Not the same story again!!,"Is it just me or are all of Connie's books sounding the same? This story had no real plot and the characters were not developed at all. What happened to the great books that she use to write? I keep buying her books thinking that they will be better the next time, but they never are. I would advise readers to read her earlier books. Don't even waste your money or time on this book!"
3,Disappointing,I really wanted to give this book 2.5 stars. The characters drove me crazy back and forth. The heroine of the book new Rigby was after her but yet she continued to put herself in these situations. The book was basically tiring. Like others reviewers stated your better off with Ms. Mason's older books like the Black Knight and excellent read.
2,Spirited but unfocused and largely uninteresting,"Recorded before an overly enthused crowd that takes pleasure in nearly ever note played, ""Release the Grease Live"" documents Deep Banana Blackout live, front and center. Certainly this jam-band set is nothing if not spirited, but the music too often descends into a cacophony of noise that sounds unfocused and largely uninteresting.The band's good performances on Sweet `Tater Pie (the only track here that is too short), Homo Lingo, Fashion, and I Believe avert total disaster of the sort typified on Devil's Harvest, where a shrill, unpleasant noise created by an ""electronic valve instrument"" would likely work to keep one's yard free from moles and rodents.I had hoped for some of the energy and complexity of say, Ten Wheel Drive, given that Deep Banana Blackout matches that long-lost band's instrumentation pretty well and Hope Clayburn is one heck of a vocalist (not that I'm putting her in the league of Genya Ravan). Oh well, listen and learn."
5,This series gets better and better,"Arminda Hobbs has returned to her hometown of Angel Heights after the sudden death of her husband. She needs the comfort of her family. Unfortunately, she finds the body of her cousin Otto in the Ladies Room of Holley House, formerly the Minerva Academy. She also finds a curious pin. The design is reflected in an Alma Mater sampler done by her great grandmother, and a mysterious quilt passed along from member to member of a group of friends. How does this all tie into Otto's murder? Fortunately, she has her family and a guardian angel to help her.The Augusta Goodnight series is fast becoming one of my favorites. The temporary guardian(her real job is tending heavenly strawberry fields) once again steps in to solve another mystery, in this case, she is tying up loose ends from a previous job. I found it very hard to put this one down and can't wait until the next one."
2,Very misleading title,"I thought this would be on the financial aspects of nursing home administration, but it is merely a compilation of statistics on nursing home utilization by state. It is appropriate for people interested in policy studies but practically useless for those of us working in long term care."
5,Another sure winner from Absinthe Films,"With the winter tradition of Absinthe Films releasing their latest installation, Ready does not disappoint. If you love big mountain and free riding, this as with every other Absinthe film, is your DVD.If you're a park rat who has never ventured to the backcountry and encountered 40 degree slopes, waist deep pow, and narrow chutes, this is NOT your DVD."
4,The Beatles - Live At Shea Stadium,"As a lifelong Beatles fan I was delighted to find the DVD ""The Beatles - Live At Shea Stadium"". I had bits and pieces of this historic performance and had always wanted to have the full concert performance of the Beatles as I had seen this live when I was 10 years old on the ABC broadcast of this event. Never seeing the FAB 4 live in person myself, this was a real find to get the entire Beatles performance on DVD. I didn't know this was available until I saw it listed on Amazon!"
1,Beatles at Shea Stadium.,This is a very poor quality pirated copy of the orginal product. I would NOT recommend purchasing anything from this vendor.
1,Not the originals!,These are knock off versions of the songs - my daughter hates it...I'm not too happy either.
4,Something Different,"I like this book. Story was different from most of the others I read. Some of the areas were a little light in detail and during one portion I simply couldn't understand why an author would take the story in an alternate direction. It was kind of like doing a u-turn while driving 55. The plot is good, the suspense was good and it all worked out in the end so good book and I hope to see more from Ms. Moore"
1,NOT THE CHRISTIAN WRITER/TEACHER,"I was shocked when I ordered a book by Beth Moore and received this one! It is NOT by the Bible Teacher, Beth Moore. Very disappointed. I was looking under Beth Moore Bible Studies on Amazon when I found this."
1,Beautiful Chair BUT vertical incline cannot be adjusted!,"This chair tilts backward vertically and is locked into a very uncomfortable position for anyone under 5' 10"". Sitting in it is akin to being placed in the front row at a movie theater. If your TV is near the ceiling, you might view programs without a whiplashed neck. If you are trying to read a book or the newspaper, forget it....unless you want to hold them up over your head. It is a shame that such a beautiful chair, with luscious leather, reclines at such a steep angle. We gave the chair to our son-law and wasted $799 though he is quite happy....and is a taller person."
5,A 'must-read' for the whole family !!,"""Generation to Generation"", published by Harvard Business School Press, is an attempt to model how family businesses work in essence. The authors' research include interesting vignettes and 'lessons-learned' from a variety of families; how they achieved their goals, how they resolved conflicts between family members etc. Since the topic of family business in academics is fairly new, this book can be considered as one of the best in its field.Important topics (such as succession, development stages and inter & intragenerational issues) are covered in detail to enlighten the reader. Contrasting viewpoints are also included to make the reader think for his or herself.In general, the book is fairly easy to read since it explains the modeling theory with examples from numerous enterprises.I strongly recommend it all who are destined to work in the complex system called family business."
5,Excellent roadmap for family firms,This is a mandatory book for all the people involved in the management of family businesses. I highly recommend it!!!
2,California is the place this movie should be,"What should have been a delightful romp into nostalgia turned into a joke. Leah Thompson, who made a name for herself in ""Back To The Future"" should have borrowed Doc's time machine. Just too campy for words, the directors were unable to find the innocence that made the show such a hit. What a shame."
2,What a shame!,"This review is for the quality, NOT the show. I bought a DVD player a few months ago because I read that the quality is far superior to VHS. Not true. Not with these two mini-frisbies.I love the Beverly Hillbillies and have several on VHS and their quality is much better. This is just someones way of making a fast buck and nothing more. The sound quality varies from bad to worse as does the picture. And don't look for that great memorable openning ""Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed..."" because it is not there. There is some banjo music that I have never heard of before. Awful! Save your money. Maybe some day, Jed and the clan will get the respect they deserve. You've been warned."
2,1963 book,"For a 1963 publication the information is dated but covers a lot of ideas on how to fix a lot of things, great title for the book How To Fix Almost Everything"
4,screen bigger than I through !,"First off let me say that Amazon shipping was FAST!!! The set works fine and has alot of cool factor. The plug and play setup got me veiwing right away.My next step is to upgrade my cable to digital.I have had samsung products in the past and they seem to be well made and last,I hope I have the same luck with this.When I ordered the 26"" I was afraid it would not be big enough,but I was thinking diagnal not wide screen."
4,VIEW THAT CITY,This is a pretty fair performance. It is really lilfted by their rendition of View That City ... that's when these Sistas really move the audience. I am happy with my purchase.
3,Ray tries to open up a bit more,"I agree with the earlier review that this book is a bit more autobiographical of Ray Davies than X-Ray was. It seems by creating an new character Les, he was able to open up a bit more of how he felt about the music industry, his realtionships and how he incorportated songs into his life. If Les is supposed to be Ray, we learn more about the American years of the 70's and 80's when Ray was living in New York (X-Ray pretty much ended in 1973). I think Ray's strongest message to his fans is that while he is a complex person, you can learn anything about him through his songs. The hits, the concept albums, and all of his stories all come in the lyrics he writes so perfectly, but yet so subtely that we might not understand the meaning until after several times listening. It's a pretty good book and mostly an easy read. Not quite as confusing as X-Ray, but also not as straightforward as Kink by Dave Davies."
4,Excellent book,"I bought this book for a Calc II course and found it to be excellent. The explanations, for the most part, are good, as are the diagrams and graphics, which make it very readable. Some of the explanations are more convoluted than necessary but these are the exception, not the rule. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the topics do not change - I have one of Larson's earlier textbooks and compared the two one day to find most of the exact same problems! All in all, a good book though. The website is great."
5,Dog toy review,The items (Large and small size) were received earlier than I had hoped. They were exactly what I ordered. I am very pleased with the product and the seller.Vivian
5,The sequel of Step by Step,"This book is the perfect sequel to Microsoft's ""Microsoft Office Access 2003 Step by Step"". You will learn tricks and short cuts to improve your knowledge of MsAccess."
1,Don't waist your money!,"The title says it all. On the other hand, if you don't believe me i'll gladly sell you mine!"
4,Nice pill crusher,I have to crush all my pills and recently I broke my sholder. Made it kind of hard to use the plastic round pill crushers because they require two hands. It is also quicker and you don't have to clean it. Thumbs up. Only drawback is that it is a little expencive for a pill crusher.
4,Funny Funny Funny,I saw this movie at a film festival a few years ago and am happy to see that it's now available on DVD. I had my doubts about a comical Jesus movie. But this really made me laugh! It's both smart and funny.
5,I Grew Up on Spurlock Creek,"Rough Lumber: Stories from Spurlock CreekAlthough I have not yet had time to finish this wonderful book, it has brought back many memories of Spurlock Creek. We moved there when I was 6. I was 19 years old when I left to serve in the Air Force. I have been on the move most of my time since I left Spurlock Creek. This book makes me homesick to go back there even though most of my friends and relatives have passed on.The book was in great condition and had been autographed by Justine Felix Rutherford. I will continue to treasure it.Thank you for the prompt shipment."
3,Elvis dolls,"The clothing detail is excellent,however, the facial details are not as detailed to the likeness of Elvis."
1,Beware!,"Don't buy this CD if you are expecting to hear the great music from the latest ""Thomas Crown Affair"" with Rene Russo. This is the ""old"" movie, and we were very disappointed not to hear Sting singing ""Windmills of Your Mind"" and the other great music from the re-release of this classic. Since we watched the movie on video, and there was a promo for the sound-track, we feel it was very misleading; for this is not the sound-track for the movie we saw!"
1,Urgh!,"Where are the great In Flames of old? Where ever they are, they are not here. This is utter and complete garbage. Please people, don't buy this CD. Spend your hard earned dollars on another In Flames CD, like ""Whoracle"" or even ""Clayman"" (which I like even though it's different from their older stuff), but not this. This is just trash compressed into a plastic disc."
1,I miss death metal,"In flames definently is going down the crapper,this is the only gothenburg band to jump on the bandwagon of stupid hardcore vocals(the kind where they dont know how to scream).It really gets me mad,that all of the other bands from Gothenburg get better each albulm but In flames gets softer and worse every single albulm,pull it together Fredman =("
2,What happened?,"I love In Flames. I always will. But I draw the line with this album. Of all the bands out there, how did In Flames not get the letter that Nu Metal was dead? And what's with the Jon Davis whisper/cry/sing thing? Yuck. What happened to the dual guitar? The accoustic medelies? The lyrical journeys? The intense instrumentals? Please In Flames, trade in your leather pants with 500 zippers on them and Spineshank T shirts for a good ol' nostalgic trip through wastelands for eternity......you guys could even do yet another version of Behind Space and I'm sure it would make your fans happier than this."
3,Not the greatest,"Good cd. Nothing really special especially for a band of In Flames Calibur (sp?). It grows on you after about a week of listening to it but after that, i use it as a coaster for my drink when using my computer. For quality Swedish death metal grab an Opeth cd."
2,dissapointing...,"I was hopeing it wasn't true. i was hopeing that all the criticism was from the close minded cry babies that scream cell out after the 3rd album regardless of how it sounds, but it is true. Ok so maybe I haven't heard the whole album, but I listened to the clips posted and if you do too, you will agree. The really have progressed and become more diverse, but what they have morphed into is completely unapealing. I don't wear my In Flames shirts anymore..."
3,Pretty Weak,"In Flames comes out with yet another subpar album. Some of the riffing here is pretty good, but most is merely decent. The vox are really bad, the sound as if they're right off a Limp Bizkit cd. Honestly, this release doesn't satiate my lust for melodic death at all. STYE blows compared to everything made by these guys up until Clayman, but in all objectivity, I wouldn't rate this album any lower than a 3 if it had been made by some random metalcore group rather than the legendary Melodic Death pioneers. So that's what it recieves."
3,About This Goofy Guy...,"Reviewer: Reveiwer from usa""its sad to know that someone like bloodshy disrepsects GOOD MUSIC like michael jackson but likes the new music that gets all of the little kids rushing to the store to get. explicit lyrics, oh that makes you cool.it shows the kind of music and mind u have. u may think, oh i hate michael jackson because i beleive the media, that shows the size of a brain you have. that proves that with your small brain, this must the worst album ever. hahahahaha. it just comes back to you.""WOW. What a stuck-in-the-past loser.. He claims this ""bloodshy"" cat is an idiot for liking In Flames and that he thinks he cool when he listens to CDs with explicit lyrics. Well, in case you didn't notice.....................................this isn't parental advisory. OOOOOH, BURN! It just comes back to you. P.S.: Micheal did it. And if it were the 80's, people might actually back him up. BUT IT'S NOT!"
4,In Flames are BACK!,"as a hardcore old-school fan, I was dissappointed with the ""Clayman"" album and absolutely horrified with ""Reroute to Remain"".however, STYE really brings back the intensity and creativity that the band once had. I have high hopes for whatever comes next.Highlights:""F(r)iend""""Like You Better Dead""""Evil in a Closet""""Dial 595-Escape"""
3,They should have taken more time.,"In Flames are brilliant musicians. I've seen them live twice and each time it was absolutely mind blowing. As far as this CD goes I think that they should have waited a little longer between this and Reroute to Remain. For an artist to put out pure, innovative, fresh art they need time to let it develop. It shouldn't be forced. This album seems a little forced when put in comparison to earlier works like Colony = pure genius, same with Reroute. It seems that they were lacking in inspiration here. However, there is still excellent vocal work and solid breakdowns and shredding riffs on this album."
5,Voice like the milk of a goddess,"This is my all-time favorite CD. It's jazzy, smooth and a little torchy in places and sung by a woman with a voice like milk from a goddess. I have almost worn a hole in this disc. I'm not a music critic or even very eloquent, but I had to take this opportunity to encourage folks to buy this while it's still available! This group would clearly have been a major success if the lives of several band members hadn't been cut short in a tragic accident. The world truly lost an amazing group, and all of Atlanta mourned."
3,"Love it, but wish it came in bulk because it's costly.","While I don't like their night product, I do like this Day Cream in the RevitaLift line. However, it's awful pricey for just 1.7 oz. I find myself having to reorder often, so one of these days I'm going to search for something more affordable that I like just as well. If only this came in bigger containers with a push-pump spout so you can just squirt out what you need... As often as I use it, that's the kind of product that I need. But, the only product I've found in a convenient push-pump container for a lesser price is Vanicream in the convenient spout container. It works well on my hands as a hand cream--love it for that, but doesn't feel quite as well on my face. Perhaps that's because Vanicream is made for sensitive skin so it's free of a lot of the stuff that makes the RevitaLift Complete Day Cream smell good, etc."
1,this toy is too small,"I bought this toy not realizing how small it is, from the picture it was misleading and it did not say the size of it,, I mean, to fit the toy in the palm of my hand is ridiculous. I am sending it back."
3,No Secrets Here,"When I first heard Joey playing on Michael Breckers ""Tales from the Hudson"", I had to check out his solo recordings. Unfortunately I was dissappointed. The entire album is filled with watered down compositions , on ""Filles De Kilimanjaro"" Joey lack the creative spark needed to drive the Miles Davis classic. Although he rarely gives the music a lift, It still was a good effort from a great sideman. Check out Michael Breckers ""Tales from the Hudson"""
1,Quality not as expected,"I ordered these nails because I am doing a major addition to my house and was impressed with the demonstration video and claims. The order shipped out and arrived promptly, and I was ready to start using them soon. Upon inspecting them, I noticed that there appeared to be differences in the spiral sections of individual nails. Some spirals are almost ""smooth"", others are slightly groved, and lastly about half are deeply grooved and appear ""screw-like"" (as I had expected all to look). I have initiated a return tonight and do not expect to re-order until I speak to the manufacturer about the apparent ""quality control"" problem."
3,mishandeling,"I got down to half and rest of box were broken plastic on nails ,as i think they may have been dropped."
3,A little about a lot,"I give this book 3 stars simply because it is a crash course in many of the topics that give learners of Spanish a hard time. It is very little information about a whole lot of subjects, but as with the other books in the series it does do a fantastic job given the crammed feeling of the book. I would recommend this book only after completing the other three titles in the series, or as a refresher course. There is simply too much information in this text and it is not covered as thoroughly as I would have liked for me to give it a higher rating. This text is not for the truly beginner Spanish student."
4,Spanish Grammar review,I love this grammar. It really useful and well structured so that it makes your studying a complete pleasure. I highly recommend it.
4,"Condensed ""Return""","If you already know and enjoy AA's ""Return of the Red Eye"" then you definitely should shell out the minimal cash in order to experience some of these satisfying remixes from that album. ""Bong"" contains several remixes of several of the albums best tracks, and given the cost and acessability of this cd, it's possibly a better option over the full album. If you know nothing of AA this may serve as a nice little sampler."
3,Fun and easy to read.,This book was entertaining and lots of fun to read. I felt like the characters were just that: characters. I never forgot that I was reading a novel. The situations that arose were believable and I did care about what happened to everyone. A quick read that's not too thinky. Perfect to read if you've just plowed through something pretty deep.
3,Where the Heart Isn't,"For those of you wanting to recapture the warmth and spirit of ""Where the Heart Is"", you'll have to look elsewhere. While the book on its own is a fairly enjoyable read, it nowhere compares to Letts' previous novel. At times it seems somewhat contrived (""look at this weird and wacky character!""), and the character are nowhere near as charming as Novalee Nation and her companions."
3,Honk & Holler Review,"I felt this book was not quite as good as Where the Heart is. It was still a worthwhile read but I found the story to drag at some points. Billie Letts is a very talented writer and I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, entertaining read."
4,Master Storyteller,A great book by a master storyteller. Once again Billie Letts has written a novel full of quirky characters and a great story.
3,More of the Same,"Like her first book, Honk is an easy read with good-hearted, quirky characters and a really badass villan. I found the characters less compelling than those in Home is Where the Heart Is. I hope Letts next book will provide more."
5,Gorgeous Characters,"This is what Billie Letts does best, involve us in everyday people with an eye for what is so distinct and special about the ordinary day-to-day. After reading this book, I found myself lingering in cafes, wondering about the lives of the men sitting at the counter, the waitresses pouring coffee, the bus boys clattering dishes, the mothers feeding oatmeal to grubby children in highchairs. Any story that can make you open your eyes to the world around you, that is a story worth reading."
4,Re: Shannon's review of The Honk and Holler Opening Soon,"I have to agree with almost everything Shannon said. Just like her I only choose the book because it was on the list both of us had to make a choice from, but I really did start to enjoy it after a while. All the characters do seem very real. The setting is very fitting, even though not one I would have chosen. I don't think I would recommend the book to everyone looking for a book to read but anybody who likes real settings with real storys will enjoy."
5,Optimism!,"I found this to be an absolutely wonderful story. The 'quirky cast of characters' is so charming I want to move in with these people! (Her other book, Where the Heart Is, is also a 5 star read! )"
2,What is the big deal? This is boring!,"I really don't know what the big deal is. Boring song parts, boring structures. I like some mellow music, and I'm not opposed to more experimental songs (I just finished listening to Galaxie 500 and Zoviet France), so it's not like this is going over my head or anything. If you live in Seattle, like I do, then you're constantly inundated with reviews about how great this band is, so I hope this review gets up on the site to help balance things out a bit."
2,The New Stuff vs. The Old Stuff,"Well I first bought Transatlanticism and enjoyed it so much that I decided to check out some of the band's other music. I was disappointed to find that their new stuff is much, much better than their old stuff. Though I'm sure their die-hard fans will completely disagree.I suggest buying transatlanticism and moving forward, not backward."
2,Better set your expectations to low for this album,"If you are expecting an album that's anything like their later music, save your money or buy something else. Very rough production and generally so-so music makes for a major disappointment from this band.Everyone has to start somewhere, of course, and it's great that their later albums have been so outstanding. This one, though, isn't."
4,Great record,"This is a solid record. It is a cut above most records and bands that are considered a part of this ""sound"". Death Cab, however, throws the discriminating ear for a loop by throwing in some pop in with the Sunny Day/emo sound. Other times, however, it sounds like something very far removed from that sound. They obviously like to make the music that makes them happy, which makes for an ecclectic mix of songs. This cd grows on you..."
3,I'm a hard reviewer and I liked this CD.,"Earnest, emotional lyrics...hooky melodies. i am a twee popper and I still enjoyed this medium-testosterone music. 2nd half of album gets kinda fuzzed out, which I personally don't like, but overall this is a good buy and a keeper."
2,USB 4-1 slot expander is ok,"I bought this so that I can have access to the ports as my tower's slots are located in the back, very inconvenient. Unfortunately this product's cord is too short and it's a stretch for me to plug in my flash drives and camera etc.The seller does not state how long the cord is, and that's my biggest complaint. The price is good and that's my primary reason for purchase. it's also compact in size and that helps too. This product will help me for now."
4,no,"I've been using a Braun 7526 for the past 7-8 years. It was satisfactory. My new Braun 9585 is far superior. The shave I get is much closer. Usually, I finish my shave with a wet Gillette razor to get the nubs. I can eliminate this step sometimes, depending on the day.I do not clean my 9585 daily. In my opinion, it is not necessary."
3,Self cleaning Brauns,"I have a 7526 and the little bumpers that stabilize it in the cleaner stand broke off within 2 years and it would no longer clean. When I e-mailed Braun about it, they e-mailed back and said I could get a new one at a service center. I was not about to purchase another one when they don't hold up, so I spent a lot of extra money for nothing. I hesitate to buy another one at these prices when they don't stand behind their product. Are the cleaning stands any better made now?"
5,The Best,"I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shavers and this one doesn't irritate my face at all. It really does give THE closest shave I've ever had from an electric and I've had one from norelco and two from panasonic, rivals disposable blades. The cleaning station is awesome too, I love not having to take any time to rinse out my shaver. For me, this shaver is well worth the money."
2,Definitely not worth the money,Did not cause irritation but did not shave neck very well. Way overpriced.Expensive parts.
2,Returning it,"I previously had the Braun Syncropro and thought this would be better because of the positive reviews and supposed technological advances. I was very wrong in that assumption. This razor does not cut nearly as close, even when repeatedly going over the same area. Also, it occasionally pulls the hairs on my neck. I am returning it for another cheaper, and far superior, Syncropro. Don't become tricked by Braun's marketing!"
1,A Disappointment,"I've read several of the ""Butch"" Karp novels (not the entire series) and remember being pleased. This one is astoundingly bad. I find it interesting that several reviewers have mentioned that it is common knowledge Mr. Tanenbaum used a ghost-writer for his previous novels. He should do so again. I won't go over all the details of the flaws of a supposed ""suspense-thriller"" because other reviewers have already done a fine job. I managed it make it through to the end of this novel, hoping for redemption of my time. I was wrong. Please spend your money elsewhere."
1,Deserves No Stars!,"I was going to title my review Tannenbaum has lost it, only to discover from other reviews that Robert Tannenbaum didn't write his own books. This may be the worst piece of trash I have ever read and I have been a long time reader of the Karp/Ciampi books. As of late however, I became more and more upset with the brilliance of the children, each of whom is unique in some way, and somehow gets involved in plot after contrived plot. Nevertheless, I decided to give Hoax a try as the premise of a murdered rap star sounded interesting. You don't even get into the murder until well into the book and in the meantime you are forced to endure the unending drivel about Karp's conflict in running for office and another history of Native American ritual. Go back and read the first half dozen of ""Tannenbaum's"" books, and then drop the rest. After a 100 pages or so, this book was in the pile to go back to the used bookstore. Unreadable."
1,They ought to be ashamed,"This book is so much weaker than every other book in the series, that it could have been written by a different author. When I checked some other reviews, I found that, indeed, it is quite possible that it WAS written by a different author. I liked the other Karp novels; this is junk.There are endless preposterous coincidences. The plot is convoluted. It's just not a good book."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I have read every single Butch & Marlene novel and always eagerly await the release of the next chapter in their saga. Alas, this may be their final chapter for me. Gone are the brilliantly drawn and interesting characters, the sarcastic banter, the exciting twists and turns, leaving pages of needless detail and outlandish resolutions. After reading about Lucy and the cliff I closed my book and have yet to reopen it. Please, Mr. Tanenbaum, pay Michael Gruber whatever you have to and bring him back. Your new co-author can write, but he can't write Butch and Marlene as we all know and love them!"
1,What a let down,"I have been a devoted fan for many years and I have to say Hoax is simply dreadful. There may be material for a good book there, but it did not materialize. And the characterisation of the Karp family is so bad it makes you cringe.I thought at the time that The Resolved would be the last book of the series. What a pity that it was not."
2,HOAX is aptly named.,"I agree with boyoboyo, who said that this book is the weakest link in the series. I was unaware that Michael Gruber had been the ghost writer for Tanenbaum, but that is the missing piece of the mystery. I kept wondering how could this have read so differently, with the characters so underdeveloped (especailly after 15 previous stories), and how could I - who anxiously antiscipated the release of each book - have disliked the entire story so thoroughly? I kept reading and wondering why the repetition? Where was the snappy dialogue? Why none of the former energy? Why am I continuing to read this? Arriving at the end of the story was a relief and a disappointment. I will say good-bye to Butch, ciao to Marleen, and look for Mr. Gruber."
1,Sad Excuse for a Book,"As the other reviews suggest, Tanenbaum was better off with his brilliant ghost writer, Michael Gruber. The outline of this book would read: (1) One paragraph of plot advancement; (2) Ten pages of boring flashback; (3) Repeat. Every single action sequence is rudely interrupted by a series of tedious flashbacks, half of which spoil the plots of some earlier books in the series that I haven't read yet, for no good reason at all. The brilliant, hilarious, poetic, witty, and sometimes profound writing of Gruber is gone. In its place are cliched characterizations and tedious summaries. Tanenbaum even explains the conspiracy near the outset, so all that's left is waiting (forever!) for the bad guys to get killed or caught. There's no real tension at all, and so little time is devoted to the antagonist that even his character is boring. A very sorry effort by Mr. T."
1,Ouch!,"I am now skimming past page 400, wondering what happened to what had been an interersting series. Now I'm here and I found out: the ghost writer quit.Anyway, I'll finish, although I know evil will be vanquished even though I'm not sure good will be served. Everyone else has said it: this is preachy, stagnant and filled with mistakes from the major to the mundane. It doesn't take two hours to get from Manhattan to Rockland Coung. More like 45 minutes. And Mount Vernon is not a wealthy suburb of New York but a very middle-class, integrated and, in some sections, downright poor. But there's worse to go with the cardboard characters and about a half book of past history and the psyche of the Karp/Ciampi famil. I've even figured out a plot twist that I'm sure will take place at or near the end.Bye.I'm about to check out Mr. Gruber's book."

3,It's ok!,"This CD collection is OK... The Nat King Cole part was good, however the Duke Ellington Band part was a little flat."
2,Brain's Winter,"I read the book Brian's Winter and this book is very boring. When the bear came to his shelter it got a little excited. I think it was boring because the author didn't give any good facts. I would rather read a book for more interest, than read a very boring, dumb book. I wish I could throw the book out in the garbage."
3,Brian's Winter,"...I would rate this book three out of five stars. I'm not a survival type of guy and that's one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy this book. Also didn't like how the book always revolved around Brian, I would rather have new characters come in and out so it would make the book a little bit more interesting. I would recommend this book to people who like outdoor or survival type story. This book could be read for fun and it could also be read to learn survival tips."
5,Brian's winter,"i was very suprised that this book was just as good if not better than Hatchet, but it was. The book is very discriptive, I loved the way he went into details it helped me imagine everything that he went threw during his winter in the woods. Because, of this the book came alive, and was graphic. I recommend this book to all who love to imagine what they are reading because trust me this book will do it for you."
2,He should have stuck with Hatchet,"This book was okay, but not nearly as good as Hatchet. It was very predictable, very undescriptive, and had the worst ending of any book I have ever read. I got to the end and thought, ""Huh? That's it? That's ALL?"" If you want a sequel to Hatchet that's worth reading, get The River and pass this one up."
5,The book was fullfilled with adventure!!!,I read all the sequals to the book HATCHET. And I must say I have never read a book that has a sequal better than its original book.
3,lost in the bloody cold wood's,"1 Brian' Winter is the sqeaul to The Hatchet. In this bookBrian is still stuck in the wood's and winter is approching so he must deal with the cold and the hunger.2 This book wasn't that great conpared to the rest of Gary Paulsen's books because there wasn't that much excitment, all Brian wored about is the cold.3 This book really had alot setting which is the descreption of the surronding. This book really rellys on descrebing every little detail.4 I gave this book a 3 because as I said before there really isn't exciting but if your a hardcore Gary Paulsen fan then you might like this book."
3,Windsor Jr. High-Kyle W.,"Back to the forest... again...I liked this book, although it was not as good as it's prequel Hatchet. It was not as fast paced. It got a little repetitive after a while though. I didn't enjoy this book as much as others that I've read. It didn't have as much content as hatchet."
5,"It was great, more like 6 stars","It was amazing and exciting. I loved it. My favorite part was when he tried to make the bear leave the camp, but the bear threw him around. Luckily he was not injured too bad. That was my favorite part of the book."
4,good book,Picture your self flying on a air plane and all of sudden your pilot had a heartattack and you dont know how to fly a plane and you crash. Well that is what Brian went through. When his planned crashed in the woods he had nothing to survive with only his hatchet and the suvial pack hed found in the book hatchet. To find out if he gets out of the cannadian woods alive or not read the book. I would not read this book if you have not read the first book hatchet.
1,Don't read this book!,"Brian's winter is a very boring book. It is somewhere around 20 chapters of a boy living in the woods. Eventualy that gets kind of old and tiring. if you like books with one setting and absolutly no excitment then i guess you should read this book, but if you are like most of the people who read books and like the ones that are exciting then you won't want to read this book!"
3,Brians Winter,"Brian's Winter is about a 13-year-old boy named Brian. He was on a plane when it crashed. The pilot died, and Brian managed to survive. Soon he found himself abandoned in the Canadian wilderness. He realized that he's going to have to build a shelter and start hunting in order to survive. The winter comes with its freezing temperatures and furry snow, but Brian is ready for the cold days and nights as never before.I liked the book, because it includes a lot of tips of survival, and because it describes such an adventurous event. The only thing that didn't satisfy me in this book was the ending, which by the way you'll have to read the book to find out.I felt interested in the chapters ahead through out the novel, that's why I would rate this book an 8/10."
4,This is one of the best Gary Paulsen books yet!!!!!,"This is the sequel to Hatchet and is very well written. It is about the scenario that Brian is not rescued. He must begin to use his bow and arrow again because his gun breaks. He eventually finds tracks in the snow and follows them to find a trapper. It is all in all a very good book except I recommend that you read the book, Hatchet before you read the book, Brian's Winter because gives you a better perspective on Brian's position."
4,Easy reading,My son had to read this as a summer book. He read it quickly and easily while enjoying it at the same time. I also read it and am going to buy the next story. I give the book 2 thumbs up.
3,Brians Winter,"Thirteen year old Brian was rescued in the hatchet but what if he wasn`t rescued? This book explains what might of happened if he wasn`t rescued. Too survive Brian must make shelter, get food, cook the food, and he has to keep him self warm. This story is mostly character because Brian changes himself in mind and body. He changes his weight because he eats healthier and he changes from unserios to serious he changes his courage bye going deeper in the woods every time."
4,I loved it.,"I loved this book. I read it as a kid, and re-read it as an adult, but now there are all these additional books in the series. It was great to ""check"" back in on Brian. Loved this!"
2,"Attractive suit, good price, really bad fit","Bought this NeoSport suit as a birthday gift for my partner.I thought I'd sized it correctly (size 8). The overall length (neck to ankles) was good, hips fit... however torso length was horrifically short giving her a painful neoprene wedgie, it also did not fit at all snug at her shoulders and waist which would have meant it waould be less efficient at keeping her warm. As we were headed for a boogie board outing to celebrate her birthday, we ended up buying anO'Neill Women's Epic II 3/2 CT (Black)Size 6 at a local retailer( She loves her new O'Neill and whenever I see her in it I think she could be their next wetsuit model) . I've returned the NeoSport to Amazon."
5,Great ladies wetsuit at an excellent price!,"I bought this wetsuit for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She didn't want me to spend too much on one and only planned to use it for stand up paddleboarding in Northwest Florida so it didn't need to be too thick. Nice color and fit well, a little long but she is only 5'1"", and comfortable. Appears strong and quality too! Arrived quickly! Definitely Recommend!"
3,It's ok,It was too tight on the neck for me and short in the torso but it had nice material and would have been a good wet suit if it would have fit.
4,...Things 'll never be the same,"This album is for those in need of something new and positive.It deals with politics, religion, and hip-hop culture. Unlike other ""positive"", acts this family of five mc's and one DJ never contradict from track to track. ""Indepedent with major intentions"" -LMNO. It only comes short in beats. Most are awesome -ranging from the melancholic to the body-rocking. Only a couple of tracks don't hit because they sound too basic, with old drum loops. No cameos (other than production by beatjunkie-members and others). Support the cause."
4,Romance Personified,"It's not easy to fit soooo many categories (i.e. romance, mystery, science fiction, music, history) into one short novel. I believe Laura did a wonderful job combining all the elements into a sensual, thought provoking novel. I recommend it highly, even if only for the music"
1,Yuckola,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read, which is a drag, given that I really enjoyed ""Like Water for Chocolate"""
2,"The author doesn't seem to care, why should we?","This book should never have hit the press. It reads like a work in process that needs at least two more revisions. The last 25 pages or so read like she threw it together in an afternoon just to get the darn thing finished. The story is sloppy -- there are problems with characters leaping to conclusions and consequences in a single bound. Esquivel makes the classic mistake of any Creative Writing 101 student -- she tells us instead of shows us. We have to suffer through pages of boring narative just to get the point. In short, if the author can't bother working on the story line, why should we bother reading it? Laura Esquivel has the ability to be a wonderful writer, but you'd never know it from this book."
3,"Don't read if you expect this book to be a sequel for ""Like Water for Chocolate""","Reading all of these reviews many people compare this book to her first one. Had this been a sequel for the her first novel, then go ahead and compare it. But this is an entirely different book with different characters. Many authors go through different stages in their lifes and many times it shows through in their writing. I enjoyed this book because I had no high expectations for it. I was dissapointed with the CD because I felt that it didn't fit the book as well as it could have. I did enjoy the past lives, but I did also feel that 'magical' things appeard to help the characters out of a tight spot. (Which actually, helps the story move along quite rapidly if you just accept things as they are and not question them.) Enjoyed the book, didn't enjoy the CD so much, loved the pictures and the general idea behind it. Good bathroom reading."
1,waste of money and time,"When I read the plot description for this book - I was excited about reading something different and unusual. Despite a nice cover and intriguing topic promised, I have found myself listening to the most boring and primitive audio book ever. Hoping to find something good about it towards the end at least I was truly dissapointed. The book is too simple, too plain, too predictable. It reminds me of the story you tell to a child while making things up as you go. When the characters seem to be in trouble, magically something appears to resque them without any additional preview of its existence in the first place. The language is very plain and constant description of something trivial simplifies characters' feelings and thoughts, while they could seem very deep and significant to the reader if done otherwise. There is no magic, just a collection of events full naive of trivia."
2,What's up with those swings? Ghosts?,"A confusing, muddled horror film about a terrifying night in a Japanese hospital. There's malpractice and a conspiracy to cover it up. There's some kind of disease that seems to be spread psychically and affects the perceptions of anyone who catches it, so that they don't know whether they are hallucinating or not. The problem is that the viewer doesn't know either. There were a couple of points where I thought I had a workable explanation for what was happening, but then something would happen to contradict it, especially at the end. I'm forced to conclude that director Masayuki Ochiai just decided to throw everything in and, if he had any idea of what was going on, he was incapable of conveying it to me./"
2,"Bad, but not the worst","This movie was so bad that a group of people couldn't even stay awake to watch it. If it's free, go for it. But, if you're thinking about buying this, you may want to think again."
4,Old Hot rod flicks,"Well they were fun to watch however the black and white movies drove my wife from the room.... There was a reason they called these ""B"" flicks, But for a lover of Hot Rods you could not ask for a better snapshot of what the old original hot rods looked like."
1,gimme my money back.......,"This album does nothing but borrow from obvious sources and does not manage to do so with any originality. New guitarist, Samuel Consiglio was a member of Tamion 12 inch, another band on the Adult. run label Ersatz Audio.Tamion released an album last year called Let's Suffer and is by far a better listen and a good reference point for where Adult's so-called 'new' direction came from. Nicola Kuperus' new vocal style is a lame imitation of Tamion 12 inch vocalist Kerry Biernot/B kerry. Save your money & check out Les Georges Leningrad or other bands on the Ersatz Audio website."
5,"Sunbeam 6142 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser with Red Ceramic Bowl, White","This was sent without the red ceramic bowl.. When I called the place where i bought it from i got there answering machine, I left a message with my name and phone and they never called me. I don't think they are very reliable."
2,"Noisy, but functional","This product makes small amounts of hot water in about 1 minute. The problem is that it is rather noisy. The first time I used it at work, my cubicle mates asked why there was a rainstorm going on. Now i'm very self-conscience about using it. I've thought about returning, but it seems like a hassle for $20. And it does work well besides the noise..."
5,hot shot water dispenser,This little water heater is exactly what I wanted. It performs well and heats quickly. I have had these pots for years and have loved every one.
4,Good quality,"It had very good quality, with no sign of wear, all pages were intact, the only problem was it's shipping price"
5,Seems to help.....,"I don't know if it's a psychological thing, or that it really works, but it seems to have helped. I take 2 every 4 to 6 hours. I've had asthma for some years now, and just had a bout with bronchitis last fall, and it's kind of hanging on. I take these, and within an hour or so, I don't seem to be gasping for breath as much. I will continue to take them, and plan on ordering more."
1,Didn't work for me,I bought this product based on so many stars and positive reviews but it did nothing to clear up my wheezing. I was hoping it would work like so many others. I'm getting tired and skeptical of buying stuff based on reading so many positive reviews.
5,MADONNA THE QUUEN OF POP,theres a reason this was named best world tour of 2001!!! amazing covering songs from bedtime stories to ray of light to music. it is a feast for your eyes and ears!!!!!!
3,Average....She should of added more old stuff,"Madonna is a great performer on stage, but on this concert...it's really odd and she only sings two 80's songs. Thank God I didn't go the concert because I would of really be disappointed because her 80's songs are the best. I mean she coulld of added Like A Virgin,Material Girl,True Blue,Papa Don't Preach,Who's That Girl,Causing A Commotion,Like A Prayer,Cherish etc. She did not include any of these timeless classics. Instead she decided to sing Candy Girl Perfume and have Japanese prints. I don't see how this was the biggest tour of 2001. I still root for Janet Jackson's Live In Hawaii...Now that's a show put together. Janet puts all of her 80's and 90's and still adds about 9 songs from her new album .Why can't Madonna do this?...Janet also has the perfect dance moves for concerts as well. Let's hope Madonna chooses a better set list for her upcoming tour Confessions."
3,The first lady of pop live,"She looks terrific, the stage is wonderful, the show is impressive. All I would change is the set list. Not my favorite group of Madonna material."
3,Inconsistent performance,"For the price, this did not work consistently. For it even to work the collar had to be very very tight - almost choking the dog. The correction also did not seem to be consistent with the level - sometimes the dog would not even react to a high level and other times she would react to a low level."
4,Terrific Product!,"I have an eight month old Welsh Terrier that the trainer described as ""extremely headstrong."" Like most terriers she is a challenge to train and this collar has been a wonderful training device. I used to call her and she would stand and just look at me - deciding whether she wanted to respond. Now she comes when called. I have never had to use this above a 2 level. She now hears the warning tone and responds. I previously purchased a less expensive model by PetSafe and returned it. It worked inconsistently and you could not depend on it when needed. The design was also heavier and ackward on a small dog. To those who wonder, I tried it on myself before I put it on the dog. The lower levels were like a small buzz and I did not really feel it until the level 7. I would definately recommend this product."
5,Excellent Product,This product works exactly as it was described to and came with an excellent CD with complete instructions for use. I have had to call for assistance once -a silly error on my part-and found their service Dept. very helpful and polite! Great company and product!Would totally recommend the Innotek Remote trainer to any Dog owner.
4,Very cool,"This is one of those strange little albums that is hard to categorize, like the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, or Moondog. This is NOT a Television album, nor does it fit in with his works that include vocals. The tone of the guitar is more of a deep, Dick Dale or Duane Eddy sound, and it all has a noirish, film-score sound. You'll recognize several cuts as filler on public radio. Not the most amazing album ever recorded, but very good indeed."
5,"""SAUCER CRASH""","I own the original Ryko CD and have no idea how the Thrill Jockey reissue compares. I love most of the songs on this cd, but there are a few that are just so-so. The cd gets 5 stars for the song Saucer Crash. I've been a fan since Marquee Moon was released, annd for me this track is not only the greatest thing Verlaine has ever done, it is THE GREATEST PIECE OF MUSIC IN THE HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH!!!"
2,Poor Component Quality,"Nice product, but power switch literally fell apart the third time the switch was thrown.Makes me wonder about the fan motor ..."
2,Don't waste your money,"Yeah, it's only $.... And yeah, punk music is awesome. It's my favorite kind of music. But there are really no good songs on this CD. This kind of music is equal to listening to an OK garage band.Get something like Sum41 or BoxCarRacer instead. Each of those are worth 10 of Punk-0-Rama CDs."
4,WOW,"I have never used an electric razor becuase they pull my hairs as I try to shave or don't shave all the hair because my hairs are too thick. With that being said this product is very good. Not great but very good. It did take a full 2 weeks off everyday use to break my skin into using this product but was worth it. It will shave all my hairs and hasn't pulled a hair yet. The only issue is that after a month of use or so, it doesn't get as close a shave as using a real razor. It takes about the same amount of time to shave and I don't get razor burn also. Overall I would give this razor 4.5 stars out of 5."
3,It works but is not the same one the Pulstronic comes with,I bought this despite the review that says it isn't the same shaver head. When I got it I could immediately tell it was different. The foil is a different patter and the middle is not blue it is silver. I emailed the seller and they said I could return it for a refund. I figured I would get the refund then buy the other shaver head at Target. Problem is I cannot find that original shaver head anywhere. They are all the same as this one. Since this was cheaper I just kept it and am using it now. I will say the shaver head seems to pull you hair more than the stock one on the pulstronic. I think it has something to do with the foil pattern. Either way it gets the job done and wasn't too expensive. Also I couldn't find the original one.
4,Great Set Of Markers,"Without a huge price tag, this is a good assortment of colors. Besides the shade variety, these markers work very easily, with little pressure. They deliver a nice look on paper. I like their durableness, and lasting longer,than other brand names. Crayola has the perfect formula!"
1,No Yellow!,NO yellow!!!!!! There's no yellow on this set of markers. The one that is supposed to be yellow is orange!If I had the receipt I would returned them.
1,Avoid this like the plague!,"Admittedly it would be hard to measure up to the classic Böhm/Gueden/Wunderlich 'Daphne' or the recent Fleming/Bychkov release, but frankly I wonder why this one was even issued. It's really awful. June Anderson, who didn't have the right voice for the title role even early in her career, is now rather too old and much too wobbly for the role. The Leukippos could never be the equal of Fritz Wunderlich (come to think of it, who could?), and the Apollo is underparted by Scott MacAllister, no heldentenor he.The only mitigating factor in this release is the orchestra of La Fenice under Anton Reck, and even they are not top-drawer.Bottom line: Read the title of this review and believe it.Scott Morrison"
5,Great Kitchens Indeed,"A terrific photographic assimilation of high-end kitchens that provides a great tool for design ideas. Whether you have a design in mind and want to see it one place, or haven't a creative bone in your body and need to actually see a photo in order to envision it, this book will meet your need. The narrative accompanying each photo essay is similarly helpful. I can't say enough great things about this book."
3,"Nice, but somewhat cumbersome","This item does provide three socks for one, but as a warning, it is quite cumbersome and tends to ""stick out"" pretty far. It works okay in my truck, but when I try to use it in my wife's SUV it interferes with the transmission selector stick. You have to remove it from the plug before you can put her vehicle in park. If you have a lot of room between your cigarette lighter plug and the shift stick this will work for you... if it less than 3 - 4 inches you may want to look for something else."
2,Broke too easily,"I managed to drop the power splitter removing it from packaging and shattered the plastic ring around the power tip. I was able to glue it back together and use it on a trip, but it broke again when I removed it from the socket. Even while it worked, it was very sensitive to any movement of the plugged in devices and lost power frequently. I need a splitter, but I'll replace this one with a socket with separate leads to power my GPS and cellphone versus a solid unit with integrated plug-ins."
5,"Touching, faith promoting story","The story of the Goodman family is a story that builds faith. It shows strength in personal tragedy, and how family love transcends all boundaries. Claudia Goodman, the mother, tells the story of her family and their involvement in efforts to promote the saving and strengthening of the traditional family unit, thus providing the building blocks for strong, good societies. As her family travels around the world, singing for important people at important meetings, they share their message with hope and faith. When tragedy strikes the Goodman family, their faith and strong family bonds get them through in amazing ways. Your own faith will be strengthened as you read about how theirs pulled them through something that could have crushed them. A good read, and a great story."
2,not a white dish,it is nice...but i thought from the picture that it is a white dish...it is not! it is clear glass. i was surprised!
5,Very Good!,loved this book! wanted more by this writer! loved all the Hollywood glitz and glamour and good love scenes also! really enjoyed this read.
1,more kid stuff bring on the happy meal,"I'm sure lil romeo never heard rob base's version of it takes 2 back in 88 it's a very popular trend to remake classic old school rap songs better yet it's popular to sign old school rap and r&b stars just ask irv gotti, and p diddy. Anyway I'm not feeling this it pretty much sucks to me if you like kid rappers this is more on your level."
1,Earlier review explained my sons favs,"My son LOVES Chingy, 50 Cent, and Nelly, though I don't listen to rap, as I listen to AC. Even if I listen to a completely different genre of music, I know Lil' Romeo is a horrible rapper, because I know Nelly and Lil' Bow Wow are better because I've listened to both from my son and Lil' Romeo is horrible! My teenage son hates Lil' Romeo too!"
3,Book lover but hard to follow,I loved the original Anne Frank I read well in High School. I thought this one would be really good now that I'm older. It was extremely hard to follow so I have had to put it down. I will try again later. It does have some very good parts in it and some pictures you haven't seen.
5,HOLY COW!!,"I have never been much of a country music fan until recently. This CD ROCKS!!! I'm not a very patient CD listener. Usually I'll constantly skip through songs, but not this one. I have listened to this CD all the way through several times. I love it!! I would recommend this to anyone....country fan or not!"
2,In Case You're Interested in 2012 & Quetzalcoatl,"Reads like a 'vocabularily'-inclined high school senior's book report. Topics covered are virtually limitless, save for 2012 and Quetzalcoatl, which are relegated to a few lines here and there within the first 200 pages. He later goes into more depth on these topics, as one would hope, but delves also into an autobiography that he seems to deem relevant. He blames his pathetic relationships with women on evil spirits, past lives, etc He has virtually no original thoughts but creates some interesting juxtapositions from the wealth of books he's read. He thinks he was chosen by Quetzalcoatl to deliver message to us........ He thinks we needn't be monogamous, yet he cannot successfully maintain a relationship with one woman who he, btw, has a child with."
1,2012 and a total waste of time,"I was dragged in by the title, I have an interest in the Mayan calendar, and thought this might be interesting. I think a far more apt title would be 2012 - the peurile ramblings of a loser. When a book starts with chapters about how the author has done all sorts of mind-altering drugs like that is a testament as to his credibility, it's not a good sign. There are some references to events and cycles that touch on the subject of a change in 2012, but they are disjointed and really don't work. Then there are shifts to what seems to be a rambling journal about the author leaving his wife and child to go lie in crop circles, hit on other women, look for better drugs, and can't figure out why his relationship is going away.sheesh. I wish to have several hours of my life refunded."
1,missleading title--disappointing book,"This book has nothing to do with 2012. Most of it is the autobiography of an extremely self-absorbed hippie with delusions of grandeur. I had really high hopes for this book, but I found it to be a complete waste of time. If you want to learn about shamanism and 2012 from a real teacher, read something by Graham Hancock."
4,Mystical Journey...,"Aloha...2012 is an exciting adventure from page 1. from quantum mechanics to amazon ceremonies the human mind wonders. To the bizarre trip on LCD where everything seems in tune, again the mind wonders. The here. The now. That is where we find our greatest inspiration. Get ready to challenge yourself. Maybe even those around you..."
2,Don't bother,"If you want something based on what Maya culture is actually like, don't pick this book up. This book is about Pinchbeck's personal life (particularly how he is unfaithful to his partner, doesn't feel loved by any woman, and how women have screwed him over his whole life), various conspiracy theories, and him traveling the world taking various drugs. At the end of the book, after getting pretty much everything wrong about Maya and Maya culture, he proclaims himself to be the return of Quetzalcoatl (an Aztec deity, FYI). Sorry to spoil the ending, but if you want to waste time and money reading a 400 page whack jobs rantings and a 10 page ""message"" from Quetzalcoatl, go ahead. Had I not had to read this for school, I would have quit reading long before the ending of the book."
1,An unintentionally cautionary tale,"This book serves as a horrifying articulate argument against the overuse of psychedelic drugs. The author's indiscriminate use of these agents and his inability to construct a coherent sentence appear, by the book's end, to be causally related. The text conveys nothing so vividly as it does the melting of the writer's own mind, as he downs every indigenous hallucinatory substance he can lay his hands on, coats the page in a nauseously indulgent ""philosophizing"" that would shame a freshman, and proclaims himself a visionary and enlightened soul. At times his babbling is so unstructured that, were one in the same room with him, the temptation to call a neurologist would be overwhelming."
1,Huh?,"The author gets a last laugh - I made you look! - from a hollow charisma that will never find what it is seeking. A quantum romanticism trapped in a Manhattan epistemology never to be the love, just a lover - always the helper, but not the help - the director, but not a direction. Poor soul needed to share his confused onanistic musings via the Y2K continuum. Minutes in a book store left me shaking my head that such a nice cover graphic got wasted on such fear induced drivel. The moqui ball, fractured fractal crystal crowd should love it. Pinchbeck should work on his carbon foot-print consciousness and his anima-animus resolution instead!"
1,"What the heck, Pinchbeck?","I didn't actually finish this book. After 100 pages I still couldn't tell what it was about. Each chapter delved into something new: telepathy, 9-11, crop circles, etc. It seemed like stage-setting for some grand theory but I just ran out of patience. I wanted to have some idea where it was all going. Instead of being dazzled and impressed by the breadth of subject matter, it all seemed really superficial to me. I didn't need to be convinced about the validity of these things and just wanted to go straight into the thesis, whatever that may have been."
2,Unable to use on a Travel Trailer Bumper,"Beware - Just because the name says it's a 'Travel Trailer Bumper Mount' doesn't mean it will fit your Travel Trailer Bumper. There is only a 4"" (3-15/16"" at the top) gap between the mounting plates...if your Travel Trailer Bumper has an aluminum clad cover (making it 4-1/8"" to 4-1/4""), this unit will not fit (and you will sending it back at your own shipping expense)."
3,Hated the husband,"The character of Peter Chambliss, the love of Maude's life, is one of the most unsympathetic lovers I've ever read. He is selfish and self-absorbed. He never should have had children - he provided little or no emotional or moral support to his children. When his family needed him, he abandoned them. When his father died, Peter went sailing, leaving a pregnant Maud alone. When his mother died, he left Maud and rejected his daughter. When his grandson died, he wanted to go sailing and leave his family to bury the child. When his daughter was in psychiatric counseling and needed him, he rejected and abandoned her. And the night of the party, when Maud really needed him, he bailed on her by driving over a cliff. I found myself feeling disgust for Maud, a strong woman, for not...telling him to grow up, be a man, and stop running away."
1,colony,Boring is the only word I can use to describe this book. I am usually a big fan of the author; but not this time. It just goes on and on and on and on. Do you get the picture. I have about 100 pages to go of this over 600 page book and I can not wait to finish it. I have seriously thought of tossing it; but I have too many nights invested in reading it and I am usually a fast reader. There is so much happening with this family it is difficult to believe. Each generation has horrible things happen. I really keep hoping it will improve---- maybe maybe ?? I dont think so ! anyway that is what I think of the Colony.
4,my review,"Once again, I felt completely absorbed in the characters portrayed in this novel. I like the way the author describes the characters, she always makes them so real, with real emotions and frustrations and feelings, be it hate or love or simple ignorance.Every single novel written by this author, carries something very different from the previous. In this case, the author combines a southern girl who marries into a very affluent New England family, and her struggles to feel included in it.Great plot and great description of places."
4,Waiting for summer - year after year,"A lovely tale of families - growing and changing - at the summer colony. You become caught up in their lives, their troubles and their loves. A good read."
1,Avoid,"Avoid this textbook. I had to read it for a college class and it was terribly written, and confusing. Save your moola."
2,Unimpressed,"Although this antenna is well made, came well packaged, assembled easily, and the transaction with the company was good, the reception from it is worse than an antenna I built myself. Go figure."
2,Probably best for outdoor use,"I bought this expecting to use it outdoors. However, I couldn't find a way to run a coax cable to it without having a window slightly open (noise and temperature concerns), or without doing something permanent (not an option for me because I rent). Instead I tried to use this indoors.Really this needs to be mounted to a pole, otherwise there is no way to have this stable; I could not find a way to anchor it to a wall. You also can not have anything touch the wire mesh without distorting your image."
2,Didn't work for my situation,"I bought this antenna to clarify the reception on my TV in our bedroom. We live in a quadplex and the bedrooms are on the opposite side from the broadcast antennas. Didn't do exactly what I wanted, in fact it made it worse. I have a friend who uses the same antenna in the front of his quad and it makes every channel come in clear. So as with most antennas, hit and miss."
5,Great Antenna,"This antenna works wonderful. I mounted it in the attic and have the signal split to 3 different tv's with no amplifier and reception is outstanding. I thought I needed the db6(bigger is always better), but after reviewing the info at (...). I took a change and got the one suggested for my location and am very pleased. Saved a few bucks with the smaller unit and the picture is outstanding."
2,Didn't work well for me,"This antenna did not work well for me, even though the TV station transmitting towers are within about 10 miles radius of where I live, and there are no tall buildings, etc.. to interfere with reception. I did use a high quality antenna cable with it as well. The Terk HDTVa antenna works great for me."
4,A very good HDTV antenna,"It works very well with the exception of one local HD channel (possibly because of my home location). I use it as an indoor antenna in a room without a cable connection. It's not a pretty antenna for indoors (especially when it's hanging on the wall) but the build quality is good. Also, although it says multi-directional, rotating the antenna makes difference in signal quality, but you're limited to the nearby wall it will be attached to (unless you use a pole to install it)."
4,Works well,Item works well in doors and works a bit better when installed out side. It gets pretty good reception for its size.
3,DB2 antenna,Good for UHF. Not good for VHF. But not yet clear if anything will work ( its a 2nd floor NYC apartment).
5,magic genie unleashed..,"I'm using this in my house, and I'm getting all kinds of new channels! This is far better than any indoor antenna you can buy, and the price is fantastic. I plan on mounting this outside, hard to believe it will be better than this!"
1,Very dissapointed in this product,I recently bought this antenna thinking that it would pull in more stations than my 12 inch whip antenna. It did not. Spent a lot of time mounting this to my roof and I get no better reception. Useless product.
2,HDTV antenna,I used this antenna in the attic of a commercial building and it doesn't work very well. I will probably move it outside on the roof as it is supposed to be and see if it works better there.
4,"Great Signal, Good Construction","I was looking for a good antenna to use to pick up local HD near Portland, OR. I mounted this unit on my second stary but still had a small grove of trees that was blocking my line of site. No problems with this antenna! Distance from my house to the local repeater was just over 9 miles. Also, I can pick up channels from a repeater that is 15 miles away NOT in line of site of the antenna. I picked up somewhere around 40 channels. The ones I wanted were in crystal HD, some not so much but I think that is environmental/station dependent rather than this antenna. I also purchased it because I liked the ability to mount it in my attic if I wanted to.Pros:Good quality, sturdy unitGreat signalCons:Wish it had more mounting optionsInstructions were tricky on how to install the 'forked' antenna portion"
2,It is Worth Paying Only $6 More For Its Big Brother,"This antenna was too weak to pull in our local broadcast stations, even though I had it pointed to our favorite station and even though we live in the same small city, in a residential area with no large obstructions. It would find the local channels but it would not hold all of them even though the manufacturer's web page rates its range at ""1-30 miles"". Amazon.com kindly took it back and we purchased its larger brother instead,Antennas Direct DB4 Multi-Directional HDTV Antenna, which the manufacturer rates at ""up to 55 miles"" and even fits on the same mount,Antennas Direct 30 Inch Universal J-Mount for Antenna Mounting STM-715. The DB4 is basically two DB2s mounted vertically over each other. The larger capture area did the trick. We had initiall paid just shy of $35 for the DB2 and then paid only $6 more, about $41, for the DB4. That extra $6 buys a lot more coverage."
5,One of the best HDTV Antennas I have tested.,I tried about 5 hdtv antennas . This one was the best one . I live in Orlando near Sea World and all of the locals come in with no problem. I get 90's signals on all of the locals. . I also get Tampa Stations(28 and 32 ) at night. This antenna works better inside for me. I have it setting on top of my entertainment unit. It won't get the local NBC station because they broadcast in VHF. I tried it outside but the signals were worse .
4,Couldn't Get Any Better,"I've never bought an antenna before, but I can talk about the results of this product. Simply put, it couldn't be any better! I pick up more stations than I'm supposed to (I'm getting 17), the HD is bar none the best HD TV I've ever seen, and although it's an outdoor antenna, I have it inside, right by the window. It wasn't expensive (mid $30s) and it's saving me a ton on money on cable/satellite. One of the best electronic purchases I've ever made."
1,piece of crap,"OK I bought this because of all of the high reviews expaecting more channels and better signal, well, I got neither. I got the same channels and worse quality than before. I tried moving it and I lost one of the two I already had and if people say that maybe there are just two in the area, I researched it there are at least four maybe five. Do not buy the glorified piece of junk!"
2,Haven't tried it yet,"I got this antenna for a few weeks now. But, I haven't installed it yet.I bought this antenna with the intention of installing it outdoor instead of indoor (which will lose about 50% of the signal strength accord to the only page of what u can call a manual that comes with the product).I was so pumped when I received it. Ready to install it. Just to realize that it doesn't come with a mount. I don't have anything to mount it on. Now, I need to search for something that I can use to mount it on. And that will cost some more money.With all those troubles, it's better produce much better signal than a pair of cheap rapid ear indoor antenna.I'll give it a 2 stars for the trouble of installing it. Not the qualitify of the signal cause I haven't tried it."
5,Great antenna,Easy to set up although does not come with a cable. I'm using it indoors mounted on a tripod near a window and it's pulling in stations nearly 40 miles away with crystal clear clarity. And an added bonus - it is made in Taiwan and not China.
3,I needed to do more research,"I can see this antenna would work if the transmitting source was totally unobstructed. However we have now found that trees interfere with reception, rendering those stations unusable. I bought this for a disabled individual who lives in section 8 housing, and they will not allow anyone except the cable company provide TV. The result is my friend cannot afford the basic $72.00/month fee so I bought this antenna so he could have some television. He can't use a computer and TV provides his only solace so we were disappointed this didn't work out for him."
1,This is the second worst thing that has happened to me since my grandmother died,"This product is so bad it made me want to hurt someone.If you want to test your relationship with someone, ask them to assemble this with you and see if you both survive it.Cons:It arrives bent and scraped all to hell.It is 1 1/4"" taller than advertised.You have to bend it and damn near drill it to make the bolts fit.Any money saved is eradicated by the hours of your life you will waste putting it together.Is made in America and made me embarrassed for my country.Pros:It didn't give me cancer (as far as I know)."
5,awesome music,Hearing the Beatles music arranged in classical format shows what great musicians and composers Lennon and McCartney were.
2,Could have been better,Not the best treatment of Beatles music from the classical point of view. London Symphony was much better.
1,Thoroughly tedious drivel,"These are the first 2 episodes of South Park, the show that's causing such a stir. After watching this crap, I can't possibly imagine why. The ""jokes"" are all at least 20 years old, and the guy who does the voices must have hemorrhoids or something. The show tries to ""shock"" its viewers, but after so many other ""shock"" programs, this is just lame."
4,Decent book,"This is not your ordinary trading book, but one that teaches some real ""usable"" techniques. The book is broken up into chapters written by different people, so the tone of voice will change frequently. The prize of this book is the Seleznov breakout method, which anyone can use to trade profitably for life. That alone is worth thousands of times the price of this book. I'd recommend this for any serious amateur/semi-pro level short term trader who may be lacking a consistent trading system."
1,wow.,"let's start off by noting that i don't like weezer. they, to me, are the stone temple pilots of indie rock. i don't buy them at all. that being said, i can still see some of the appeal of songs like say it aint so or buddy holly. it's pop. whatever. but beverly hills...wow, what a turd. one super boring nothing riff and ""ironic"" lyrics about beverly hills. did i say wow yet? i don't even know how to put this. a song about not fitting in beverly hills. you actually sat down and wrote this for people to hear? that's as deep as your irony flows? up next, a song about jocks. forget it."
4,"Great single, but even better b sides","It would get more of a 4.5/5The first single for make believe is well written and has a wonderful chorus. I would give this song more like a 4.5/5. After beverly hills comes is what i think is the best performance of island in the sun. even better than than the live song on the lion and the witch ep. I would give the live b side a 5/5. it's simply the highlight of the single. Then comes Butterfly live, the song has a very cool intro with Rivers Cuomo talking. This song is also a very good performance given by weezer. I'd give it a 4.5/5. And for the enhanced bonus video comes beverly hills. Personally I love this video and it would rank with such classic videos such as Buddy Holly and Keep Fishin. The video would get a 5/5. Overall, this single is great and I think you will enjoy the great feautures of it."
2,Too Much Intarsia,"The title of this book was misleading, and if you don't know how to do intarsia, you are wasting your time.And your money.I am so disappointed in the contents of this book, it's hard to describe."
3,Slow Moving,Kind of slow. I didn't realize that they were going to talk about his whole life. I thought it was going to start off with the start of his career with the FBI and when he began to spy until his arrest.
3,Yet Another Attempt to Understand Robert Hanssen,"Here we go...another attempt to get a book out in time to sell it before the general public forgets who the subject is. Problem is with that theory is that we have seveal books that are way too much a like. If only one would have covered his chilhood better and paid epecial attention to Opus Dei, both of which I believe had more effect than anyone will ever know. I'd also like to know how an FBI Agent got his hands on all this supposed NSA and CIA information. Even in these days of ""Homeland Security"", these folks just don't share well at all. I think there is/was a middle-man (CIA?) in there somewhere. No way NSA or CIA would reveal info to the FBI, who they consider just to be the Federal police dept with no ""need to know"" anything important of an international nature. The whole thing sounds bogus to me. - Former NSA Employee"
3,"Comprehensive, but still some holes","Previous reviewer's comments are noted well, but I was somewhat disappointed in the coverage of forms development. I really wanted to learn to move/place fields on a contact form and designate them drop-down, etc. Simple enough, I thought, for a book of this coverage. But even though the author talked about the abilitiy to do this, there were no directions, no examples, and no description of the 'Controls' options required to do it. For a book of this size and price, I had hoped for more meat. No, not to the detail of VB scripting, but certainly more detailed coverage of Outlook's powerful forms and macro abilities. To my chagrin, I'm finding my answers under the Outlook 'Help' section in the program itself!"
5,Harville Hendrix is an awesome teacher!!,"The book was received in a timely manner and the condition was as promised.Have just finished reading ""Getting the Love you Want"" by the same author. He has the best way of presenting & teaching that I've ever experienced with a writer on this subject matter. And, wonderful exercises are included at the end to enable readers to practice application of what they've just read. Very helpful."
4,Prantik's Review,"This book not only gives us an insight onto the physical aspects of Yoga, but also enriches our mind body and soul with some spiritual facts about Yoga explained to us by Swamiji in very simple and comprehensible words. Reading the book and applying the knowledge has helped develop and improve my entire personality. It's a must read!"
3,Decent album,"It ain't a kick ass album for starters,they took a lot of sounds from a few grunge bands of the 90's & incorporated it into their music.It is an enjoyable album with highlight tracks like I like it One Way,A Lot Of The Same & I Feel Down.Schaefer looks like Layne Staley a bit with the sunglasses like goggles."
1,Read the SELLER reviews!,"The product shown and described is not what you get. They send loose, most likely used, balls with corporate sponsorship logos printed on them. I am not kidding. I don't know where they got their hands on these, but these are not new balls. They showed up in a paper mailer. You will be disappointed and have to go through a lengthy process just to get your money back."
1,False Advertising!,"I bought the AMT NightStorm, expecting a high-grade optical device, but as it turns out I received a very poor piece of equipment. I was using it outdoors and the image quality is poor, and the images are distorted."
4,pretty good sound quality,"This little device was pretty cheap but I must say the sound quality is better than I expected. It's also a lot easier to use than I thought it would be. The batteries last for a while too, so thats good. I would say if you need a recorder, this is really good for the price."
2,It lasts for only 5-6 months,"It is very comfortable and stylish. BUT, it lasts for only 5-6 months (400-450 miles of walking/running). This is my 3rd pair and I am taking into consideration of trying some other brand name that may last a bit longer. Volkan Akkurt"
3,A fine shoe -- but they are hot,"This is one of the few shoes that really work for me in terms of fit. Unfortunately, as one other reviewer notes, they are uncomfortably hot whether you are exercising or just sitting."
2,Not enough support,"I was disappointed in this shoe. I have a very narrow foot and always buy the 11-AA in this series, and this 992 is not as comfortable as the old 991's I still wear because it does not support my foot as well, does not have enough arch in it. I was even wondering if it is not a ""knock off"", not a true New Balance shoe. I can't send it back now because I've decided just to wear it and see about getting some new supportive insoles in it."
4,From 991 to 992,"The 992 is probably the shoe with the most comfort and support. If you are buying a 992 because you can no longer find the 991, you will have to shave off at least a half size. The 992 is wider at the toe, so you do not need the extra space. I ordered my usual size for a 991, but it was like a boat, so I sent it back for a half size smaller. I could ""maybe"" go with a full size smaller, but I am not certain. Beyond that, it is as fine a shoe as the 991."
4,great item,Great item makes the PSP way more comfortable to handle. It even works well with the PSP-1000. The only gripe is that mine had a bit defective battery pack where I have push and shake the power adapter into the slot to make it charge.
1,Terrible,If you are interested in making your audio system sound better spend the money on a pioneer noise supressor this thing makes music sound like they are singing in a hallway. it makes the quality down right terrible. but i have to say the engine noise will go away.i gave it 1 star because there wasn't a lower rating.
1,Dont bother buying,Did not work. Could not tell any difference at all. Went to local stereo shop and bought a $25 RCA filter and plug that in and work perfectly. My advice is do not buy just get a RCA noise filter. Another nice thing about the RCA style is you can plug it in at the amplifier therefore you do not have to remove your stereo from the dash.
4,Twelve Dancing Princesses,"My granddaughter received this book from her Aunt. She loves princesses! She wears her little princess crown every day! The book itself is well written. I feel it is meant for children between the ages of 5 an older. My granddaughter is 3 yrs. old. She loved the pictures of the dancing princesses, but it did not keep her attention. I'm sure as she gets older, she will truly enjoy it."
5,Church History,"Good book for basic history of Catholic Church. Easy to read, almost conversational, but contains the important highlights (and lowlights) of the Catholic Church. Contains a timeline at the end that is a terrific summary of the information contained in it. It didn't take long to read this."
1,History from one who dissents,"When I read passages that prove the author is not fully united to the pope and magisterium, I question the whole book. When I read dissident statements by the author, am I reading a dissident slant on historical events? I didn't waste my time once I hit the author's ""I know more than Holy Mother Church"" sections."
2,Where is the Acid?,"Well, now I know why it was so cheap, it ships without acid to add to it. No where on the site did it tell me that the acid was not included. I now either need to return it or find a source for the acid. Not cool!"
5,A Musical Milestone,"Poignant, passionate and very beautiful, Juan-Carlos Formell's music sweeps you away into new territory.He is probably of one of the world's great guitar players, and his band is perfection, This is a different perspective on Cuban music: innovative, yet rooted in tradition, ""Las Calles del Paraiso"" is a musical milestone - the ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band"" or ""Magical Mystery Tour"" of Latin music."
1,very dusappointed,"it brought little holes everywhere, I am very disappointed, I thought you were serious people amazon!!! this is the first time something like this happens to me, i want my money back..."
4,Great Handbook,"Purchased this reference book online and before I could put it down I'd post-it tabbed over 60 points of intrest. Not only is the info helpful to me as a solo artist, but to my band as well. I'm still trying to get it back from my guitarist! Guess I'll have to buy another copy!!"
2,Stuff You can Figure Out Yourself,"I'm sure Mr. Baker is a nice person, but his big skill is not conquering the music business, it's writing self help books & keeping himself employed.I'm not that familiar with all this new internet marketing stuff, but most of Mr. Bakers suggestions are things people can come up with themselves. Mainly the author offers motivation, self help type positive affirmations.The book is peppered with lists which repeat themselves endlessly & very little hard information!"
3,"Has flaws, but kept me reading","I would normally not have bought this, but it was free as part of ""read an ebook week"" both on Amazon and through the publisher Imajinn. I thought that the plot was imaginative and compelling but the characterization was a bit iffy. I found Ash's moods to be a bit too mercurial and the transition of those moods too abrupt and rather unexplained until late in the story. I found Cathy's fatalistic attitude toward her own life somewhat unbelievable, even taking into account her past history. Having said all of that, I really could not put the book down and read it in less than a day. The author was certainly able to make me care about the characters and Ash's world was well drawn. I enjoyed it and will be looking for more of Ms. Hendricks' novels."
5,Captivating read,"I was unsure if I was going to enjoy this book very early on. As I continued to read, however, I became captivated. I found myself reading at stop lights to find out what might be happening between the main characters, Ash and Cathy. I stayed up late nights just to finish and find out how it all ended. I was more than pleased. I was so involved with this book, it's characters and it's make believe worlds that I never wanted to put it down. I found myself a bit sad when I did finish it. It was a truly romantic and wonderful read that I wish never ended! I laughed, I cried (sobbed), and I lusted! I highly recommend it!!"
3,Light easy read,This was an enjoyable story. It was not anything special but just sort of fun. The characters were predictable. A story with just enough angst and magic to make the reader continue until the obvious conclusion.
2,"Cheap, but heavy & klunky","I bought this iron because I needed one and didn't want to spend much money. It was definately cheap, but this iron is very HEAVY. I don't like the large size either. The iron doesn't seem to be put together very well. For instance the water pour hole is very small (you should really save the water cup that comes with it, it's probably the only thing sized correctly to get the water in the hole) and there is a cover over the top. To close the cover it seems like I am going to break it. The dial to turn it on is also very difficult to move. While the iron turns itself off after a certain amount of time of not being used, it switches back on when you move it again. Annoying when you just want to put it away. Basically, I am saying it's cheap, but not cheap enough. My last iron was purchased at WalMart for less than 10 bucks and it was great (until the cord blew out of the socket...). Good luck..."
4,Last Just long enough,"I got this pillow around my 28 weeks of pregnancy because I'm usually a back sleeper and could not get comfy on my side. This pillow did help a lot and is worth the money! However, it is now flat and if I get pregnant again, I will most likely have to get it restuff or buy a new one."
2,Disappointing,"I'm really disappointed by this CD. The musics good, but you can't download any of the songs to a PC. That sucks!"
3,"Comfortable, but some difficulties with the audio","I was using this product with a Motorola E815 ... the first time I tried to use it was on a very busy street, during the rain. The receiving audio seemed full of static, and both the receiving and transmitting audio seemed to fade in and out. I just chalked it up to the adverse environment.The second time I tried it in the comfort of my home; the receiving side fading and static were still quite apparent. I had to return this headset, which was unfortunate - it is very comfortable for someone who wears glasses."
2,Not very functional,"Although this earpiece is comfortable, it is difficult to make myself heard.Further, mobile devices use this tiny connector. It should be made in the 3.5mm connector."
5,Excellent Service,Book was in excellent condition and arrived even sooner than I expected. Will do business with again.
3,Pretty good.,"I bought this item for my E815 phone. They sound good and I really like the integration with the phone (i.e. the button on the side and the ability to talk or listen to music). One issue is that if you're looking straight ahead the mic doesn't really pick up all that well and sometimes I get complaints from people on the other line. If I have to talk in public with them I either lean my head down and to my shoulder or pick up the mic.The earbuds can be a little uncomfortable, but with a little carefull placement they're not too bad."
5,Excellent reading!,"Insipiring! Easy to read! Loved every word! If you are a fan of the Holy Spirit, YOU will love this book on how to hear the voice of God in today's hectic (loud!) world. I passed the book on and, for all I know, it's already been around the world."
2,Good ole' boys & and airplane,"how a book rates is sometimes a matter of expectation. I had thought I would learn a lot about peregrine falcons and other similar species. I expected to read about birds, places and migration. The reviews indicated it was an enjoyable read. But I was tired of hearing about what mavericks the two charaters were. I don't think you could draw much information about falcons. If you want a book about the adventures of two good ole' boys as they ride an airplane following a radio beep then the book will satisfiy but if you want a book on peregrines, bird life etc. this is not the book."
4,Old Fashioned Flowers (Brooklyn Botanic Garden All Region Guuide,"Received the book in good condition, nicely wraped. The book arrived in the amount of time expected."
3,Nice but inconsequential.,It had some fun chapters and made a good easy read for the jetlag hours during my Christmas travels. Unfortunately I never really got to care much about the characters.
2,Fevre Dream,I bought this book because I have been totally engrossed and enthralled with Mr. Martin's Ice and Fire series. I was very disappointed with this book. The characters are not particularly interesting and I became bogged down and bored. This is one of the very few books I have ever decided to abandon before finishing.
3,"Pleasant, unchallenging read.","This is not the George R.R. Martin of the Game of Thrones series, but someone who is just getting a handle on writing good novels. Undeveloped, unengaging characters, little narrative momentum."
2,Very Disappointing!,"Was looking forward to reading a great book by a solid author, but instead picked up dime store novel! Truly not worth the money. The characters were not fully developed and the story was weak......could have been so much more! Sorry George, I just could not get into it.....took me three weeks to get through the book...and only cause I paid $7.99!"
4,"To dream,perhaps",It was a good read not as good as his song of fire and ice series but worth reading.A haunting tale about vampires and our desire to be more than mere humans.
5,A dark and delicious story that every reader should savor...,"I first read this novel in 1988, and I have since read it again - once a year like clockwork. It is a spectacular piece of writing that evokes tasty images of a wayward Mark Twain on acid, as Martin leads a group of the undead into a family reunion that only an unlikely hero like Abner Marsh could survive. The characters are vivid and deeply rendered, and their quests, both good and bad are the stuff of classic stories. It is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read, and one of the most fun. Find it, read it and keep it close - it's a blast..."
3,Good story,"Overall impression - interesting story. Good book.The beginning was very promising. I liked the protagonists and story line. Sort of a cross between of King's Salems Lot and Rice's The Interview with the Vampire. But somewhere about 2/3 into the story it lost something. It lost its momentum, some kind of spark. So, the book became a bit dull but towards the end it picked the pace once again and the ending is satisfactory.However, there is one question that has not been answered.WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!If Vampire females died each time a new vampire was born, would not they run out of females eventually?"
4,"Good book, read it!","I thought the book was good. Too short, maybe, and a LOT of women whose husbands are now Orthodox priests. As a converting woman, who knows my husband is not likely to become Orthodox (much less a priest!) I would have appreciated more in the way of stories with a little conflict(?) or struggle in the move-because I know I am getting some!One EXCELLENT thing I noticed and notice while learning more about the church is that 'heresy' or no, other church denominations and experiences are pretty much valued and respected. All of these women had spiritual experiences that THEY valued before coming into orthodoxy and which led them to it-usually by taking the next step in the positive path they had already begun as Christians. I thought it very respectful and positive-for all that they did leave their former churches, and sometimes not in the best of circumstances. Still, they were part of a journey, and I found that the journey was honored."
2,Too detailed and the ending left me stumped.,"I really would like to know what happened at the end. Did Shepp jump into the river, or did he run into Sarah's arms? The ending, as mentioned above, has me stumped. I know it is one of her earlier works - it's just too wordy. I've loved other books that she has written. This is the first one that I cannot figure out. If anyone can help, please contact me. Thank you."
2,just can't get into the read at all,First I have to say that I love every other book Anne Rivers Siddons has written. I've always been able to get lost in the story or lesson and not be able to put the book down. So maybe that's why this one is disappointing to me. I've been trying to read it for about a year now. I've picked it up and put it down so many times that I've just given up. It really is to wordy and I find myself reading a paragraph and not knowing at all what happened because it doesn't grab my attention. It's a never ending book. I'll write back next year to let you know if I ever finished!
5,Such a moving book!,"I picked this book up at a used book store because I was missing my home town of Atlanta. I was searching for something southern and stumbled upon it. It was hard to read at times because a lot of bad things happen and it is heart wrenching, but it is hands down my favorite book! Such a wonderful story not just about the characters, but also about the city itself."
1,Broke within 2 days,"Within 2 days of moderate use, this toy just broke. It is clearly not made of durable enough materials for its use, as it is nowhere near strong enough for a dog to actually ""tug"" on. Now that it has snapped, my dog can tear pieces off of it, and I have had to take it away from him. He is extremely sad, as he did love it before it broke."
4,Family connections,I am my family's genealogist and found 3 connections in the book to our Normans who were with William in 1066. In researching my French and English sides I came across Battle Abbey and was delighted to find the Roll on Amazon. Anyone looking into family histories may find this book an additional source of information.
2,"A very basic book for shower planning, mostly games, etc.","This is an extremely basic outline of shower giving with very simplistic ideas--not exactly a planner for an elegant, Martha Stewartesque affair. Fine if you plan on LOTS AND LOTS of cute games, but thin on ideas for a beautiful party."
3,Too small,My head size is PRETTY small compares to other girls. But this helmet didn't fit on my head at all... I wonder if this is for kid.
4,Satisfied,"Good fit. Light on the head. Would of given it a 5 but it is hard to adjust the straps once you adjust them initially. I had it on when I fell, first time in 30 years of riding. Problem was that I hit the pavement with my face not my head. The good thing is that the helmet stayed on perfectly, during the impact. It would of protected me well if I fell the other way and that is what it is all about."
4,good helmets,my daughters are very happy with these. very comfortable and they like how they look. will buy again for youngest daughter and wife
5,great helmet,"The Giro Skyla Bike Helmet is a light comfortable helmet. I have never worn a helmet before and was hesitant since I am not fond of wearing hats. This helmet truly fits the bill. I barely know that I am wearing it, yet it is sturdy and well-cushioned."
1,broke after very little use,"I purchased this helmet and it was great for about 1.5 mths. Then, one day I am fastening it and I'm not kidding, the styrofoam just gave way and the part that attached the chin strap to the helmet broke off. Can't use it at all now. To make matters worse, Amazon won't let me return. Don't buy this item, because when it break, you won't get your money back."
2,Buy (and of course ride) with Caution!,"I bought this helmet at a local bike shop. It was reasonably priced & as others mentioned it does fit a bit snug. I'd give it 3 stars, but minus 1 star for fit, & minus 2 star because the visor is so flimsily attached by these three small plastic tabs.Maybe after about a month of wear, I was about to make a right on a busy street, and the middle snap broke off on the visor, literally dropping the visor directly into my face (over my eyes)! I seriously almost crashed going down hill on a busy San Francisco street. I would strongly recommend that you just pull off the visor to begin with. You don't want to experience that horror that I briefly felt.Now that the snaps are off, I feel that the helmet is now reasonably safe. but talk about a close encounter!"
3,What happened to Paranoid?????,My copy of this cd just arrived ... WITHOUT Paranoid! Anyone know what happened? Did Black Sabbath sue to prevent current copies of the cd having the song? Does this create a black market for earlier copies that actually have the song?
1,DO NOT BUY,"Pure junk! this will be the most frustrating gift you will ever give. Brewing requires sanitation to be sucessful, this piece of dung cannot be dissasemble to clean then reassembled. The gasket on the tank will leak.Buy one of the cheap kits that can be cleaned and then the gift reciepient will have a taste of homebrewing then can decide if they would like to move on to bigger and better.It is ZERO Stars....Minus 5 maybe."
2,"decent device, bad mixes","I have had the Beer Machine for a few weeks. I really like the clever design: A multitude of functions in a very compact format. If you assemble it carefully according to the instructions, you can avoid leaks according to my experience. The capacity is suitable for a novice, because you may have to make a few batches before learning how to make YOUR beer, and discarding a smaller volume is always less depressing. But do not waste your money on their beer mixes, if taste means anything to you: By using theis concoctions you get some alcoholic liquid that can hardly be called beer. I would recommend that you don't even open the bag that comes with the device. Rather, to avoid the inevitable frustration, buy, right at the beginning, a higher-end beer mix from some respected, well-known manufacturer. In that case there is some chance that, after a couple of weeks, you can tap yourself approvingly on the back."
1,Crappy book,This book is disgusting. No one could eat after we open this gem. Even the book smells like poop. Yuck!
1,This Book Belongs In The Toilet With The Other Poop,"Now who would talk about such a disgusting subject. And then you must be very secure with yourself or to insecure to actually write or read this book in public. We all know that you eat and poop we don't need a colorfully illastrated book showing us how. This book was even worse then ""I Hate My Bestfriend."" Talk about a cruel irony."
1,Desensitizes Entire Family to POOP,"Indeed, it is true that everyone poops; however, not everyone poops like a monkey, as page 21 infers, nor does everyone poop like a snake (snake poo is white and chalky) or poop ""here and there"" or ""on the move"". I highly recommend you research your own species and the ""acceptable"" way to relieve oneself prior to unleashing a deuce in any kind of Avant-guard situation."
4,"Ah, stinky-- whoops, I mean, sweet revenge...","After receiving the infamous Japanese import `The Gas We Pass' as a Christmas gag gift from some family friends last year, I decided to look for a little something to strike back at `em with for next year. Fortunately, I found what I was looking for: `Everybody Poops', which, if you think about it, makes for a fitting companion piece to the flatulence tome I received for yuletide.Like 'The Gas We Pass', `Everybody Poops' is part of a series of simple and amusingly straightforward children's books from Japan that cover those oh-so-unpleasant body functions. This one, obviously, goes over fecal matters, which is a natural cycle for all members of the animal kingdom. Some really fun (although somewhat crude (in more ways than one!)) watercolor illustrations of various animal species (including humans) performing the titular function are included.Needless to say, I can hardly wait `til next Christmas-- it'll be the ultimate payback!`Late!"
2,Just a cliché,"I was so excited to buy this book and then read it and found out it was a flop. It is supposed to make kids understand that it's ok to poop because Everyone Poops. But there is no real lesson here. It just shows animals pooping and asks rhetorical questions. (""What does whale poop look like?"" What parent can answer that when a child insists on knowing?!)This book is supposed to be iconic. But after you read it, you'll see that it's just a cliché."
3,Limited review. Final review on arrival of disk,I have not receied the disks yet. I have known of the Mephisto Waltz track for 5 decades. It is spellbinding! It was first released in the mid fourties on Victor Red Seal. My copy went the way of too many moves. I will report on the other cuts when I get the disk.
1,Unrated,"Have not received this product yet! Unable to rate. Very disappointing, I purchased this item to attend a ""Sixties Party"" given on the 31 July 2009. Today's date is 14 August 2009."
5,Bryce - A Latin American Giant,"There are not enough words to adequately describe how much I enjoy the literary creativity of Alfredo Bryce Echenique. This Latin American author managed to fully capture my attention and evoke the days of my youth growing up in latin America. I have read several of his books avidly and found every one to be a unique piece of art. ""Un mundo para Julius"" powerfully captures the essence and reality of societies in many Latin American capitals and large cities. The light and delightful style of Bryce's narrative is both entertaining and profound. The story of Julius is compelling and uncannily real. It is indeed a classic. One of the most interesting features in Bryce's prose is how he seems to combine his own style with elements from the ""Magic Realism"" of Gabo (Garcia Marquez) and the mordacity and energetic style of Vargas Llosa into a wonderful mosaic of elegance and fluidity.This book is sincerely recommended."
2,One of the first books written on B2B,"Very academic book. It has some good content, but it lacks appropriate implmentation experience to round the content of the book. It gets boring at times. I have no doubts that future books on the topic will be far superior"
1,Remarkably boring picture,"I hesitated giving this film a one star rating as I try to save that for films poorly made. But this movie is so consistently dull and uninspired throughout that I had to give it the lowest rating.The story revolves around a college student who thinks ""Annie Hall"" is the greatest movie ever made and a bible for relationships. He finally meets a girl who changes his mind. Kind of a weak premise for a movie, but with a perceptive, humorous script played with passion you could make it interesting. Unfortunately this movie lacks all these ingredients and is quite tedious to watch."
5,A Songwriter's Songwriter......This CD is a CLASSIC,"For those of you who remember Kevin's first A&M release, ""Fear Nothing,"" as a little country, a little rock, a little pop....and have been waiting FOREVER for another release...you won't be disappointed to hear ""Another Long Story,"" an outstanding showcase of Kevin's heartfelt vocals and perfect songwriting. Although still defying any genre stereotype, this cd proves that in his long absence from the limelight, Kevin has created a solid artistic identity. The title track is an introspective look back at his life and career and perfectly sets the stage for the remaining tracks: slice of life stories, gorgeous ballads, moody grooves, and even a couple of rockers. Each song is hook laiden and memorable. I can't recommend this cd enough - it's an essential to any collection of the finest American singer/songwriters."
2,Great until you wash them...,"I have been using these cloths for a couple of weeks now, and decided it was time to wash them. On the back of the box it says: ""...machine wash regularly in warm water."" When I took them out of the washing machine, all the stitching on the corners of the binding had come undone on every cloth! I was quite surprised and very disappointed. Don't know if anyone else who has purchased these has tried washing them yet. I would love to know your experience if you did. Before washing, the cloths worked well and I was very pleased with them. Now, not so much."
3,Good Cloth,More expensive than other ones I could find and the color is not blue. You get three multicolor cloths which is fine the picture is misleading though.
3,"Bad. Really Bad. But, A Good Kind Of Bad.","As a certain mad scientist put it once, ""Good for us. Bad for you."" If you're a die-hard lover of hong kong action films, you may flip for the kitsch, but this is four movies you will not be able to get through in one, two, or even three sittings. A little goes a long ways. Because it's tough. Because it's really tough. Because it's just plain bad. Let's drive to Florida bad. Let's buy 100 lottery tickets bad. I think I'll eat this whole jar of pickled eggs bad. Watch the movies. Then ask yourself: why did I do that? If you dare."
5,Cowboy Sam takes Texas by storm,"A wonderful new cowboy has entered the Texas scene.His name is Cowboy Sam. This book,Cowboy Sam and Those Confounded Secrets, has a special message to all young and old cowpokes alike. There is great importance in keeping someone's special secret. When Cowboy Sam finds he can't keep all those secrets under his hat, he has a problem to solve. The figurative language and absolutely heart warming pictures allow the reader to travel along beside Sam as he solves his problem. Kudos to these emerging authors as they captivate us with this wild west tale."
1,wake me up when it's over,"The best authors write about what they know - this gentleman wouldn't know the CIA from the ATF. Neither does he know the Washington Metropolitan Area very well. I thought Tom Clancy could be long-winded sometimes, but this guy takes forever to get to the point. Very disappointing book - slow, boring, not worth the time."
2,poorly made,"I have had this unit for just over a year. Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out. Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the ""no disc"" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration. To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit! Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime. It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony.....By the way, the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor."
1,Worked for 2 weeks,"Sound wasn't too bad for price. Tinny yes, but cheap. Used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play CDs. And then it wouldn't turn on at all."
1,Very poor,"Recieved this item and only turned it on twice, everything seemed to work fine and sounded great, when I tried to tuen system back on doesn't seem to have any power. I have tried several outlet and still no power. I guess I paid for just for show and no music."
1,"Not well made, hard to use...already broken.","I think this is a waste of money. I wanted a cheapie CD player for my daughter to listen to CDs...haven't even had it for three months and it is broken. The CD drive now shows 'no disc' no matter what we do. Unfortunately, I can't return it because of Amazon's return policy. Buy something else!"
1,Poor Quality,"A couple of weeks after purchasing this product, the buttons started getting stuck when clicked. In addition, the sound quality is horrible and the CD player is very sensitive to even a slightly dirty CD."
2,I didn't care for it,"I really shouldn't review this book because I read it as a kid, long long ago, and then did not finish it. At that point I found the book disturbing, partly because of the deliberately sinister nature of the world, and partly because the heroine was an adult with adult issues, and not a kid, like myself. I would disagree with the reviewer who said it was ""geared for a young person audience."" I think it might appeal more to teenagers, possibly the older, more cynical ones. In fact, I think it might hold up rather well against the supernatural YA fiction of today."
1,Salsa in the city,Terrible because in the image said salsa in the city when I got it is Mexican music that I never like. They need to fixed or make sure what is they selling take a look at the image of the cd . I don't want to returned because the price was nothing and I throw away
2,My 8 year old didn't like it,"I tried to engage my son in this book 3 times with him ending up not liking it. The stories were not amusing, which is why I got the book for him. I'm not saying someone elses child won't like this...just that mine didn't."
1,"It retains water, curved and contoured wrong",Up side is that it's molded rigidly and even corrosive water hasn't eaten through it or left much stain. But it's contoured for sinks with no rim height (think of undermount sinks). It's just not contoured correctly to be used with conventional stainless steel above-mount sinks...
2,Frustrating.,"Very frustrating to buy a board like this, only to have water accumulate in the two lower corners and start to discolor a slimy orange. Also on the board as well. The first time I cleaned it, the clear vinyl started to cloud up. So now I have a dirty drainboard that always pools water in the bottom corners. It does drain about 95% of the water. But that 5% left over is dizguzzzzzzztin. I'm gonna toss it the first chance I get!"
3,Looks good,"but appears to be more cheaply made than in years gone by. This drain board is different from others I have used; the long side of this ""Rubbermaid Antimicrobial Large Drain Board, Black"" is the side that drains into the sink. I am used to having the shorter end drain into the sink. I have not used it yet but will give it the old college try.I have been using this drain board for a while now and am still trying to get used to it."
2,Poor Construction for Water Drainage,Product worked nicely for one week after which the center area sagged and water sat without draining. The underside needs better reinforcement to prevent buckling.
1,Does not drain.,"I specifically bought this for the microbial property, but this is the absolute worst drain board I have ever had. It does drain: all over my counter. This design needs lots of work."
1,Side drain,"From the photo I did not realize that the drain is from the long side of the rectangle, which makes it unusable on my narrow counter top."
1,Ultra cheap construction,"This product is a perfect example of ultra-shoddy construction, likely the result of serious cost cutting measures at the manufacturer (which used to be a reputable brand). In short, the silverware basket that clips onto the dish rack itself has clasps that bend permanently out of shape and thus become useless after a very short time (in my case five days!) -- and with only a minimum amount of weight applied. The rest of the products is fine, but my suggestion would be to factor in the cost of a new silverware basket when considering this product."
2,oh dear,"Here's why you should never buy a rubber drain board. After a few days the water that settles actually creates black slimy spots on top of the drain board (and especially in between the cracks) and it's VERY hard and annoying to clean off. I have to scrub hard with a brillo pad for several minutes (up to 10 minutes sometimes). This is a nightmare and can easily be fixed by purchasing a plastic one instead, so I recommend going with that. You're probably thinking I'm not draining the water after I put the dishes away. No I am, but if the drain board remains wet and let's say it's raining outside and damp, the water will absorb into the board regardless. Even thoroughly drying the drain board with a towel still has the potential to create those dreaded black marks.Also rubber tends to get weak and tear after a few years of using, whereas plastic won't. This means the sides of the drain board will probably tear eventually. It really is a better alternative to just go with plastic."
2,Doesn't really do what you'd expect...,"As other reviewers have noted, the big drawback of this drain board is that it doesn't drain... The plastic bows down in the middle causing water to pool there. A little more tilt would let the water drain fine, odd that the designers didn't pick up on this. It also lacks gripping power underneath so you're constantly having to readjust it so the drain edge is over the sink. Poorly designed product."
1,Not what I expected,These tools are not what I expected. I would recommend them to use on soft material such as clay. They do not seem to have the capability to be very sharp.
1,don't waste your money,"i was looking for products in between grooming for my english bulldog and purchase fast bath thinking it'd do the trick... WRONG!!! i swear there's only alcohol and water in the bottle. it didn't leave him smelling clean and the spray hole hardly ever worked. i always ended up pouring some on a towel just to clean his paws after an outing because i didn't want to toss it in the trash after my 2nd use.....try john mitchell/paul mitchell pet cleanse....worth the money, does the job, smells clean and fresh!!!"
4,Good,"This CD is really good, you may buy it.P.S But too many companies made same music of this CD in others, you may find one is better than this, so 4 stars."
4,soooo funny,"when i first heard u+me=us, i needed to hear the rest. i downloaded parts of of some of the songs. i just bought the cd, and i love it. it is really too funny. i know that if i ever need a laugh i just have to listen to ""rub one out"" or ""u+me=us (calculus)"". it really gets a great laugh and i recommend it!"
4,Pretty good...,"This was a pretty good CD. They had only abour 6 or 7 songs actually sung by 2ge+ther, because they had a song by Whoa! and Unity or something like that. They had a remix of ""U+Me= Us (Calculus) and a remix of ""Rub One Out"" (sung by Whoa!). It's pretty good, maybe not so many remixes. Just 6 months after they made this, they released their second CD ""Again"" which is an awesome CD too!"
3,wolo 365 enforcer horn,"this horn hooks up very easily no problem at all,it is just no were as loud or close to as loud as i was lead to believe."
2,"A Pale Imitation of the ""Inimitable""","A very disappointing novel, on the whole. Marley's early life is invented with some imagination, but after that we learn little of his long business career. Osmun's newspaper prose style evokes nothing whatsoever of Victorian England and the novel is not at all Dickensian in flavor or inventiveness. Sentences are short and rhythmically monotonous, repeating ""Marley"" as their subject over and over again. I think anyone who undertakes to elaborate and extend one of Dickens's stories at least needs to make a good job of giving a Dickensian feeling to the story and achieving a prose style that at least suggests a Victorian setting."
1,One star is too many!,"The old saying goes, ""If you are going to get involved with a musician, be prepared"". It's not a normal life and no musician ever pretended it was. They have greater temptations and problems than someone with a 9 to 5 job. Priscilla knew what she was getting into, before she got into it, so I have no sympathy for her. Understanding musicians is the key to a happy life with them. Apparently, she was too selfish to care about anyone else but Priscilla and how SHE could benefit. Elvis was no saint, but who among us is? I think Priscilla's bubble was burst when she found out that Elvis was a real human being! How childish can you get?"
3,Elvis the man,"Elvis & Me is an interesting though one-sided look at Elvis Presley written by his wife Priscilla. It provides a more human look at the King then most books about him including some frightening glimpses into his dark side. As far as factual information it is quite lacking and his career achievements are greatly overshadowed by his personal life and his relationship with Priscilla and is more a biography of her than her famous husband. That being said, it still provides more insight into Elvis the man than any other book I've read."
1,The best part of the book is the pictures,"I read the first chapter in the bookstore before making the decision to purchase it. I told myself I wasn't going to give Priscilla one red cent if she was negative about Elvis. The first chapter was basically the ONLY chapter in the book where she wasn't painting a bad picture of Elvis. This book infuriated me - I finished it, but regretted purchasing it. The only reason I didn't throw the book away is because of the pictures. Would not recommend to an Elvis fan."
4,Could be useful,"It does not cover all territories, but to a certain degree, it could be useful. Bad reviews do not help. If you don't like a book, keep your mouth shut. The world is already full of hatred, and more nasty words show the low character of a person. Go after criminals, not writers, poets and educators!I like the book. It is a good addition to my library. Of course, it needs a a major linguistic face-lift, nevertheless, it is a good product!"
2,Grrr....,"Honestly, the main character, Chandra was soo frustrating that I felt like pulling my hair out! I think Catherine Coulter is a fabulous writer, but this isn't one of her best books."
2,Didn't live up to the fabulous name...,"I bought this book because a) my name is Chandra and b) it was less than a quarter! HA! I never buy romance novels, and read just a bit of this, before I discovered that I was right: horribly cheesy. Ah well, it STILL says ""Chandra"" all over the place. Way cool!"
2,"Too small, Not enough quotes!","It's OK to carry with you, but does not contain enough quotes. The book is very small, I mean small! Sir Winston deserves a bigger book than this!"
1,JUNK !,I bought this same flex shaft at a local hardware store and it gets very hot and sounds like the thing is going to fly apart.Made in china says it all. took it back.Spend the extra few bucks and get the Dremel flex shaft like I did.Well worth the money.Milescraft also sells a flex shaft and atachments just like the dremels only cheaper. I own a couple.Remember that you get what you pay for but with this product you dont even get that.
1,Completely wrong,"The predictions in this book turned out to b e a joke in 2009 . Never believe a thing Dent has to say again,"
1,Nice prediction Harry,"Harry, this boom is incredible. I can't believe how rich people are getting with the DOW almost to 40,000, just like you said."
2,A possibility but very unlikely,"This book is an interesting read but this guy is not an expert. He thinks were goign to have a huge boom from now until 2010 and then were goign to hit a depression. He says the Dow will hit 40,000 (please). Maybe he is right, I hope that he is. he probably just wrote the book to make a quick buck, use your common sense oil has nowhere to go but up which will probably make out economy go bad, inflation will become high, interest rates will rise, real estate will soften and in certain areas decline, and the stock market will probably go sideways until the depression which is the one thing I agree with him on in the book. Sucky reality but its likely but dont' take my word for it like you shouldn't take his!"
4,Can Alex go twenty-four hours without the powers?,"When Alex uses her powers to stop Rhonda Clarke from shoplifting, Annie is furious. Alex used her powers in public, which is dangerous. So Annie offers Alex a bet she can't refuse--go through twenty-four hours without using her powers. Alex is sure she'll be able to win the bet. But Alex soon discovers that someone is spying on her, and that someone isn't nice. Will Alex be able to stop the person and win the bet?This was a great book. I really like Diana G. Gallagher's books, especially the Alex Mack ones. A good thing about this book is about there's much more action than described on the back cover. And I was shocked when I found out who was spying on Alex and why they were doing it. I would recommend this book to someone who likes humor and action--even if they don't like Alex Mack books."
5,The Best Vegetarian Cookbook Ever!,"We are not vegetarians, but we like to enjoy vegetarian meals. So we have a few veggie cookbooks. This one is by far the best. This one teaches you to use what is fresh and in season and has 100's of recipes. Some of the spices are harder to find, but well worth the effort. You will never think of potato salad the same again after you try just one of the potato salad recipes. Fresh beet salads changed our whole perception of beets (they're not only from cans and they taste wonderful). The variety of ingredients, seasonings, and flavors make this book an adventure you will surely enjoy.This book was printed in 1993. We're just sorry we didn't find it sooner."
2,Disappointed with this polar model,"Have been using Polar HRM for the past 7 years; and my 2 previous models, NV Trainer and another one I forgot the model name were very satisfactory. But this latest model S120 is a big disappointment. The push buttons doesn't work unless you press it precisely, the clock is slow by 1 min per day! (maybe the battery needs replacing?), and overall the unit looks cheap. I bought this online without looking at the real unit."
3,"Erratic, unpredictable","It's a cool sports watch but setting it to tell time was a horror show that required a call to the help desk. The manual is totally unclear and seems to be written in Martian. Also, I got it for the heart monitor. Maybe it will and maybe it won't Yes, the chest strap is on right, the contacts are wet. Sometimes it works. Sometimes not. Sometimes it works for awhile and goes to two zeros for no discernible reason. I'm not sure at all this is worth the aggravation"
1,"Amateurish, pretentious","When I saw this in the store I bought it on impulse. So many of the Naxos American Music series recordings, even of unheard of composers like Carter Pann, have been so good. When I opened it and saw that the composer is 'self-taught', I thought, 'Uh oh!'And, I'm sorry to say, my initial skepticism was borne out. The scenario is pretentious in the extreme, undergirded by half-baked Jungian philosophy. The music itself is amateurish, poorly composed, poorly orchestrated, not terribly well performed.I have a guess: it is conducted by Theodore Kuchar, an excellent conductor. He had premiered it with his Boulder, Colorado, orchestra, and and has now recorded it with the Ukraine National Symphony, of which he is also the conductor. He has made many recordings for Naxos and Marco Polo. I suspect he was allowed to record this twaddle as payback for his Herculean services to the those labels. Is Mohr is cousin or something? It must be something like that.Sheesh."
2,Returned item-arrived defective (rusty),"If this wouldn't have been a gift, I wouldn't have minded the discoloration that appeared to be surface rust. However it was a gift and I returned it promptly for a full refund. Unfortunately they didn't send me a pre-paid label so I'm out the $10 it cost to return it."
2,Not as advertised !!,"The clock radio that arrived was as pictured on the website. That is where the similarities stopped. Here is what was not as advertised:1. The 'Auto dimmer' that is supposed to adjust to room light is just a hi/low switch.2. There is no Weekend Alarm Cancel function on this model.3. There is no time zone selection.4. There is no daylight savings time selection.So, the remaining features do seem to work and are on this model. The CD player can play CD-R's which kinda surprised me.I read the manual, so it is not that I just didn't know how to use the missing features.I am disappointed in Amazon for advertising this product incorrectly on their website."
4,Nice product,"It works fine but would be nice if it's also able to receive old analog channels.Also, the subtitle character fonts are a bit small for my eyes."
5,One of the best jazz albums in recent years,"This is one of the best jazz albums to be released by anyone in years. The playing and composing are first rate and very beautiful, and there is a mood, an atmosphere to the music which recalls the magic of the 1959-63 era of jazz. Cohen is a major talent and I will track his future progress with great anticipation. In the meantime, this one stays on my CD player all the time."
5,"An enthralling drama, highly recommended","An Audie Award finalist, The Consciousness Plague is the abridged audiobook on CD adaptation of award-winning science fiction author Paul Levinson's dark saga concerning a sudden, alarming spread of memory loss - and the insidiously destructive impact this pathological memory loss has upon human society. NYPD forensic detective Phil D'Amato discovers evidence of a bacteria-like organism that has lived in human brains for millennia, and might be responsible for human consciousness. A new antibiotic is crossing the blood-brain barrier. As D'Amato himself falls victim to memory loss, he must struggle to get the authorities to pay attention before the fundamental essence of human community and society are lost! An enthralling drama, highly recommended. 7 CDs, 8.5 hours."
5,Excellent read,"Excellent read and hard to put down. Sharra's Exile is a re-write of ""Sword of Aldones"" in which the author goes to great lengths to develope the characters. Very much worth reading even if you've read ""Sword""."
4,nice collection,This is the most complete collection of Dionne's Arista hits so far. The only drawback is that there are no lyrics and liner notes. Maybe a showcase of her album covers should be included too. Sony BMG can also consider releasing a DVD featuring her videos (if she has any) so that we can keep it as a collection of our memories.
1,Fake!,"If you're a serious Trammps fan you'll hate this CD. I've no idea who it is actually on the CD, but it sure isn't the Trammps. I hate giving bad reviews but this one deserves it. I've been a Trammps fan since the mid 70's and this sure as hell ain't them on the CD. This CD is a fake and should be avoided!Get yourself their Greatest hits or Disco Inferno and the latest one ""Trammps [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED]"" which is a remaster of one of their first LP's. Just don't buy this pile of junk.I just wish it was possible to give zero stars."
5,Classic,One of my favorites from childhood. Now passing it on to my son! It has a great message and Dr. Seuss never fails!
5,Memories,"I remember reading this book when I was a little girl, so I just had to get it for my little ones. It helps teach them about big/little, less/more, etc. It's a great book."
4,cute and funny early reader,"Cute story about Ted and Fred, two dog friends who are opposites. When they go on a skiing vacation, their accomodations leave them unable to rest easily, until a little bird gives them some good advice. Excellent for the kindergarten/first grade reader."
2,Rerecorded Song,"Sold as original Hits. The first song, Bread and Butter, is not an original. It says so inside the booklet with the CD,"
3,NOT UP TO PAR,"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING UNIT--HOWEVER IF YOU PUT IT UNDER A COUNTER ON THE INTEERIOR OF YOUR KITCHEN, THE RADIO WILL NOT PICK UP STATIONS. THE CD WORKS QUIT WELL. EASY MOUNTING UNDER COUNTER."
1,"Horrible product, don't waste your money","Too bad Amazon won't allow 0 or negative stars. I read the bad reviews on these but decided to try it anyway because the fetching Mrs. wanted it bad. What a mistake! When the plastic mount for the laser pickup broke from snapping CDs onto the spindle, it jammed and burned out a motor. It is the cheeziest CD drive mechanism I have ever laid eyes on, and I've seen a lot of them in my line of work. Avoid this piece of junk at all costs!"
3,Not up to her usual standard,Nora Roberts does a consistently wonderful job in weaving a story that is interesting with characters the reader can connect with. This book was not as engaging. I usually can't put one of her books down without reading it completely cover to cover. I really struggled to finish this one.
2,Summer Desserts,This book needs more ingredients. Doesn't hold my interest at all. I am almost at the end and I am very grateful that soon I won't have to read it any longer.
2,Doesn't Work,"I tried this in the hope that it would help me cut a few calories, but alas these things don't do much to curb your appetite. I tried it for a full month and drinking one for breakfast and lunch, but was always starving afterwards. I should have known that this probably wouldn't work, there is no magic bullet with this type of thing.The flavor is ok, it definitely tastes better with milk. But if you want to bring it to work its a pain to have to bring a separate container full of milk to mix it, water makes it a lot easier, but the flavor is really lacking."
2,Waste of money,This product taste delicious when blended with a banana and milk. BUT!!! It filled me up for an hour only. I think that it filled me up because of the froth andbanana
5,Works great and taste good too!,I decided to try a sugar free shake to help curb my appetite with the hopes of losing weight. The shake tastes great if you add half skim milk and the other half water. I am only using one scoop and love the taste. It keeps me satisfied throughout the day! I'm only on my second day and think that I will lose weight by using this shake. Love it!
2,Massive gas and Upset stomach!!!!!,"No doubt it suppresses your appetite and keeps you full for 3-4 hours, but its side effects are too strong for me to give it a decent rating. After consuming this shake (in water) I develop massive gas and later, upset stomach. It's a product I can only consume when I'm home or on weekends. It's a strict no on office days."
3,Not Quite up to their high standards,"This one falls a bit short for me. I agree this is a jazzier disc, more than their first one, but it is also much mellower and less adventurous as well. They would correct this with subsequent releases, such as Time Crunch and Organik, both of which are first rate. If you're new to the group, start with those 2 cd's, or their excellent self titled first disc."
5,Very satisfied.,"Excellent product. Very happy with size, color, and overall look of this substrate. This shipment arrived before estimated arrival date. I use this in nearly all my tanks. I did not rinse, but I used a bowl to on the bottom when filling up to create less disturbance. Brief cloudiness the next day, perfectly clear the the day after that. No parameter issues. Great for planted tanks!"
5,Incredible smooth music!,"This CD is amazing!It is my favorite right now and I think it is going to stay that way for a very long time! It's incredible how the women's voices give you a trance into the music that they sing.All the compilation is very smooth and perfect for anything, you can be calm and you can be totally active with this CD. No doubt it is the best.When it comes to trip-hop it compiles the best artists and even the order of it is absolutely enjoyable.If you like Trip Hop, this cd is a MUST. Also is the best example of what great trip hop is for someone who has never heard about this gender.My 5 stars to this CD!"
3,Just OK...,"I thought this book started off very well. I enjoyed the writing style and approach, and did not find the author's use of apostrophes to be a problem at all.Then -- about a third (or less) of the way into the book -- the writing seemed to become significantly less polished. Events seemed forced, characters were no longer acting in plausible, well-thought-out ways, etc. It's as if the bulk of the book didn't get the final round of editing.As a side note, the Kindle edition had a number of places where separate sections were jammed together without even a blank line between them."
2,Can't say I'd recommend ...,"The prose in this novel is well written. The story, however, was only at times engaging. I found the prologue a bit trite and skipped reading it. The book switches back and forth consistently between characters and instead of giving the tale a riveting edge, it was done in a manner that was confusing and unnecessary. I think the author has talent, but I would not recommend this book or series to friends."
5,This book takes you on quite a ride...,"It's one of the few fantasy books I've read in recent years that I found really hard to put down. From the frying pan into the fire again and again. I caught myself thinking once or twice that I wanted the pace to slow down so I could catch my breath. You get a deepening appreciation for the characters as the plot moves quickly along and a sense of mystery about what you don't know yet. There is a freshness to the author's style that remindes me of the first time I read about elves, dwarves and such in the Tolkien books. The best comparison I can make is to say that this book has elements of both Tolkien and the early Norton Witch World. But much of what grabs you is the presentation. Nicely done, especially for a first novel. I eagerly await the sequel (predicted may 99 publication) that I just ordered."
4,one of the better books i have read.,In this story u start out with 3 mages who sacrifice their life and goodness in order to save a land under attack by the Gul'Gotha. Alseasa now belonging to them the mages have secured a way of hope that their land will be reborn with the comming of a wit'ch.And boy does she come she receives magick qand her woman hood all in one day. Then with having to deal with that right away she gets attack and all of her family either dies by her magick or dark magick or are kiddnapped.The book mainly explains how all beginings start with a gathering of unussal misfits and people of the last of their race.It also ends happy with a bang and a twist at the end.I would so reccomend this book and the other of the banned and banished series.
4,Okay. . .,"I do have to say that I loved this book. I read it in the course of two days; I couldn't put it down. But the thing that **really** got to me was the apostrophes. Saying rock'goblins or moon'falcon ***is not necessary!!!!*** Just say, rock goblins and moon falcon, hmmm?"
4,"I found the book fun, creative and criminally engaging.","I gave this book a four but I would like to qualify that. I was delightfully suprised and impressed with the vision and solutions in this book. I thought the making of the blood book, the problems encountered, and the effects of the spell were all fanastic creations and pleasantly imaginative. The two weak points I felt in the story was the use of too many characters, and no real sense of a solid closer. Clemens did a excellent job of weaving all his characters, but I thought there should have been fewer with more detail on each. There is five centuries and an arm that weren't hardly touched that I really wanted to hear about. Lastly, even for a single book in a series, it is possible to bring a sense and feeling of closure to a story, and I didn't quite get that with this book. I do look forward with great anticipation to the sequel. I couldn't put the book down, Supurb writing James!"
1,good story bad morales,"the country's been taken over and in a last attempt to save it 3 men sacrifice there good to create a book with which a wit'ch will save the country in the future. this is a good book and the author managed to capture your attention. but i have a few probloms with it. namely this author is so chovionistic, even if the main charecter is female he manages to belittle it. then he addes to maney charecters to be comfortable with and dose not develop some of them well. but other then that it s a great book."
4,Ron Lake knows his stuff!,"I've had the privledge to meet Ron and have learned a great deal from he and his team. His experience in both investing and analysing managers placis him in the rearified world of those with true insight. Reading his book will bring some of this long earned knowledge to you. The work is understandable and approachable, like Ron himself. Get the book. It will help."
3,Microsoft Word 2003 Inside Out,The book was incredibly detailed. I have been using Word for almost 20 years but I learned a lot of new things.
5,Great addition to your collection,"This is one of the first crochet books I ever bought (about 10 years ago), and it is still one of my favorite books for making afghans. Even with so many other books in the market, I consider this one a staple. I just recently bought it again because my first one finally gave out on me. Highly recommended."
5,"ROCKSTEADY, SOUL, TRUE GOOD MUSIC","I expect people everywhere will know Go Jimmy Go soon! It's a mixture of reggae, rocksteady, ska, soul, and gospel! The horns rock and the lyrics are tight. The CD is awesome and seeing the band live is unbelieveable. The lead singer Bison has so much charisma you can't help but be drawn to the music and lyrics."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. IT'S LISTED AS A MULTI-DISC COLLECTION OF MUSIC FROM VARIOUS ARTISTS. WHAT IT REALLY TURNS OUT TO BE IS A GROUP CALLED ""THE HIT CREW"" DOING THEIR VERSIONS OF THE SONGS WE'VE ALL GROWN TO LOVE. I WAS VERY HURT AND PISSED OFF! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BY THE CHEAP PRICE THAT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE."
4,Very good reference book,"Just like it's predecessors, this is a very good reference book. I like the beginning of each age group, when they state what your child should be doing. It helped me keep track of where my son was developmentally. Other than that, don't bother reading it from cover to cover, since kids do things so differently. Just use the index to look up issues as they occur."
2,"Eh, it was okay, but...","The first two entries into this library were great, but this book did not live up to my expectations. Some of the advice given was outdated, and sometimes just plain wrong. I have used it a bit, and I do read the monthly chapters as my child ages, but I would not use it as my primary source of information, and certainly not as my sole source of information."
3,good as a reference - but not so good with parenting advice,"While I think this publication is an excellence medical and milestone reference guide, I feel it is too heavy handed with many parental ""advice"". The book gives short lame reasons why a mother must wean by 1 year or suffer the ""consequences"", and co-sleeping is painted in the most horrible light, regardless of the fact that many many families, including myself have sucess with co-sleeping and can be insulting with comments like I am ""cowardly"" for following my motherly insincts and not letting my baby cry it out when she is in need. My recommendation is to see this book as a REFERENCE and not a be all end all guide to parenting. Parents should follow their hearts and their instinct and not always what it says in some book."
1,I have to,"I got to the part about breastfeeding, and stopped reading. I mean breastfeeding coming between my husband and I. Forestalling development of self comforting skills. Increase of ear infection. if you nurse beyond a year. I did not read any reviews on this book prior to buying and sort of wish I had. So personal I think the book is outdated. Would much rather read something along the lines of the Girlsfriends Guide to Toddlers or the Emotional Life of Toddlers. My daughter is still nursing at 20 months, and has recently moved from the family bed into her own bed. At he rown request. And I will contiune nursing until my daughterdecided otherwise. SO anything with such a negative attitude to nursing is sat on the shelf until it is resold on Ebay."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with the advice in this book and found myself disagreeing with some of it. Incredulously, the author DIScourages breastfeeding beyond 12 months of age! I guess she must not be aware of all the evidence that points to breastmilk being beneficial up to 2 years+. A lot of other advice in the book seems arbitrary, anti-AP, and not backed up by research or proof. It is a huge book and of course there is some good information in it. But the bad advice touched enough of a nerve that I would never give this book away to a friend."
4,"Decent book, but one sided.","This book is great at describing the normal stages and development of a toddler. It is biased towards no spanking, vaccines, and working parents."
3,Informative book but biased towards outdated information,"This book, like others by the same authors, has lots of good info for parents who have lots of questions. However, they go off the deep end in their attitudes towards sugar intake, general nutrition, and breast feeding. They seem to think that breast feeding past one year is only done by needy moms who can't let go of their ""babies"". Not ever mentioning that the Academy of Pediatrics recommends nursing well into the second year. This book is a good overview of general info, but I would caution readers that the biases of the authors come shining through all too often."
2,Not a good reference book.,"I have What to expect when expecting and the first year, and loved them. So I naturally bought this one when the time came. I am so disapointed in it. On more than one occasion I have gone to it with a question or problem and have found nothing about it. Simple stuff too. But they tend to cover more obscure subjects. I have no idea where they have gotten their ""questions."" I have found this book shoved under the nightstand for months, whereas the other two were practically under my arms 24/7. When I do take it out because I have a concern, 9 times out of 10, it hasn't helped a bit. I am now searching for a new book that will give me some piece of mind."
4,Great for my RV,"These are great little devices. I wished they shipped with some stainless self taping screws, so I didn't have to run to the hardware. Very good visual and readability even at a distance. I use them to level my RV and am very happy. The material is a little thinner than you may hope for, so I hope they last."
5,Makes Life a Whole Lot Easier....,"Well, maybe not life, but leveling a Travel Trailer for Sure! Great purchase for me. They work well, look good and are easy to apply. Read the directions first, they are specific to where they go."
2,Beautiful to Look At!,"This is a very attractive, high quality toilet seat. The main problem is it does not fit my standard American toilet. It is too small. I contacted the company about it and they were willing for me to return it if I paid a 10% restocking fee and provided it arrived in good condition. By the time I paid the restocking fee and the return shipping it hardly seemed worth returning it. I also worried whether it might arrive damaged. Anyway, it is beautiful to look at . . ."
3,lights?,"I love how this clock looks, I love that if I tap the top, I get a glowy blue nightlight, I love the nap button, programmable from 20 minutes to 2 hours, I love the ease of use with the buttons placement, it even has good reception for the radio.I hate that I bought it at the beginning of April 06 and by August half the lines that made up the numbers on the face no longer worked. It is impossible to read the clock anymore. I hate that when I went to the point of sale, they no longer carry it, and when I went to RCA, they no longer even show it on their site."
3,Disappointed,"I should have learned from Joseph Shocky's review at the top of this list. All the songs aren't there.I've searched in vain for ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" as done in the movie by the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" and can't find it.Is that one of the missing ones or am I just not finding it?"
1,down from the mountain,"""Down from the Mountain"" is as bad as ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" is good. Don't buy it!"
4,Great tracks,A great soundtrack for a great movie. Those that like bluegrass will like this concert. Those who saw it live will be thrilled.Great music mixed in with merely good.
4,Classic bluegrass,"If your into bluegrass then this is a must for your collection,it would be extremly difficult to ever be able to get together such remarkable talent again.Highly recommended."
4,Good buy,"Giro Skyla Sport Bike HelmetThis helmet was as advertised. I needed the extra large size, and it fit fine."
1,Not my best decision,I tried to do double sided copies when I first got this but it didn't work. I decided not to send it back to Amazon and gave it to a local Canon service center. They got a new unit from Canon because they couldn't get parts.This copier now works for double sided but has streak when using top feed.I have had this copier less than a month.Not a good choice.
2,Starting off on the wrong foot,"Used this printer for a grand total of 2.5 business days (light duty) before it crapped out with the error code e225. Called customer support and waited on hold for quite a while only to be told that the unit can't be fixed without a technician for that error code. Options were to have a replacement mailed and return my unit, or take it into a repair center.Seriously, does anybody actually check these things before they go out the door? I know I'm working with a small sample size (1), but I can't help wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem.For what it's worth, the machine worked great for the 5 print/copy/scans we did before it broke, but that would leave me with a $50 per use cost on the first machine and I don't think that's very attractive to most business users."
2,Poor Support for Mac OS X,"I've had the printer for about 9 months now. It works fine with Windows XP and Windows Vista, but the lack of support for double-sided printing and scanning in Mac OS X using the drivers provided by Canon is disappointing."
1,Missing Hardware???,"I bought the printer for a friend who had seen it in an office supply store. I gave it to him and never tried the printer. HE claimed that it was a stripped down, display model that did not contain the necessary hardware to make it fully operational. He exchanged it in an office supply store and is very happy with the complete printer."
4,good value,"This is a perfect fit for home user and maybe home office.I'm expecting to fulfill my needs for long period of time. It is fast good quality and multifunctional.4 stars because nothing is perfect, always is room for better"
5,This thing is great for the price,"The MF4150 is awesome. Prints very fast. Text is crisp and clear. Graphics are pretty good. The ADF is nice for scanning a bunch of papers to PDF for reducing paper clutter. Duplexing is great. And the price was excellent for the feature set.If I had to change anything, it'd be to add a duplexing ADF so that it could easily scan 2-sided docs, and ethernet connectivity would be nice as well. But, Ethernet can be added by buying the MF4690 (albeit for about another $100)."
1,Do not buy this device if you don't have a dedicated phone line,If you do not have a dedicated phone line you cannot receive phone calls without the fax interrupting the call which is incredibly annoying. I called Canon and that's how the machine is suppose to work. So you either use it manually or don't receive incoming calls or get a dedicated phone line. A truly ridiculous result for a personal fax machine! If I had known in advance I would not have purchased the device.
1,Scanner does not work with Mac OSX,No scanner driver is available for Mac OSX. Image Capture software within Mac also does not work. Mac users please do not buy this product.
5,PERFECT - for the price I paid!,"Paid $180 with no tax and free shipping. The best features are:1. Duplex printing, duplex copying, and duplex scanning.2. Fax from my PC or by itself.Could be a little loud when scanning but bearable. This machine replaced an HP Laserjet 1012, Canon U670 scanner, and PC fax card. Individually I paid well over $200 for them and now for $180 I have one machine that does everything! I am able to scan and archive all kinds of documents now which was the main thing I was looking for. A document scanner with ADF costs at leat $400 dollars. This machines is probably not professional grade but I just need to scan maybe 20 pages a day which now takes two minutes compared to half an hours with the flatbed scanner (placing and replacing each page and waiting for the scanner head to return to its original position after each scan). Absolutely love this machine!!!"
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I have sworn NEVER to purchase cheap underwear again. If you purchase these you will NOT be disappointed. These panties go beyond comfort and fit to ... well, lets just say there are no words to express what a proper fitting panty can do for a woman's outlook on getting dressed every day! I immediately placed a second order. Magnifico!!"
5,Great panty,"Bought one pair at an outlet sotre. Was so comfortable and this price is a bargain, so I order more through here. Definitely plan to order again as needed."
1,missing components,Service was acceptable from Seller: ma-accessories. The products batteries and users manual did not come with order. When I reached out to get the missing components I was told that customs' had removed the components and the reduced price was a reflection of this yet there was no mention in the description. If I chose to return the product I would receive a full refund. However original shipping and return shipping would have been more than purchasing the product at a brick and mortar.The issue for me is that the there was no mention that the product was open and missing components in the description.Buyer beware.
1,Not very good,"First of all, the method opening the chamber to install the batteries seems simple on paper. Actually opening the chamber takes up too much time and effort. Then putting the cover back on is another hassle in itself. I enjoyed the small size, though, but that small satisfaction is overshadowed by the frustration by trying to open the chamber. I do not recommend this because I am sure that people can find other mice that are not only small and compact, but are easier to use."
3,Great learning tool....WAY overpriced for what you get.,"We purchased this game because my daughter's teacher said it would be helpful. My daughter loves playing and it has helped. My complaint is the price for the quality. The ""chunks"" are thin pieces of plastic, for a price tag of $27+ I expected something much nicer. I wouldn't suggest buying it to anyone due to the quality. You would be better of making the tiles yourself out of cardstock and laminating them."
5,Impossible to Not Dance It!,"This CD is just awesome! If you like and appreciate good classic salsa you will not be able to listen to this and sit still. This is better than medicine if you are blue, you will feel transported to a happy dancing place!"
5,Ascending Tabor,An awe inspiring work on prayer and the spiritual life. Simple and clear yet incredibly profound. Your heart will be moved to seek deeper communion with Christ.
3,Not very exciting,"We received this free and the talking part never worked. My son likes watching Diego and wondered what all of the parts were. He hasn't really used it much and he just got it. Also, the magnifying glass doesn't work which I think is silly. We definitely won't be buying expensive batteries to make it work either."
3,"If you loved Bravheart,you won't necessarily like this book","First, I'd like to commed Mr. Randall Wallace for writing one of the best scripts to one of the best movies of all-time. This book however, does not touch the levels of emotion and tension that the movie had. The only thing that makes it worthwhile, is that it had background story plots that were not in the movie. It has stuff about the Princess, and Wallace's trip to France that were not in the movie. It may be a good book to read as a pastime on a rainey Saturday, but it definitly lacks the luster of the movie, and quite frankly, actually spoils it. If I didn't have such an admiration for the movie, and Randall Wallace for that matter, I'd come right out and say. (IT STINKS)"
1,Much much worse than the movie,"Frankly, this book is pretty horrible. Randall Wallace may be a great at movie scripts, but he can't write novels worth beans. It doesn't seem as if he strives to make the reader bond with the characters; as a result, the story is flat, undramatic, and unemotional, completely opposite from the movie. Really, the novelization doesn't do the movie any justice"
1,"Inaccurate, misleading and so badly written","Although I enjoyed the film despite all it inaccuracies, (Ayrshiremen in Kilts, no Stirling Bridge etc etc ) I had hoped the book would have been more accurate, but no. Nothing more than a badly written book version of the script. So now all the plebs out there think Wallace was father of Edward the third... no way. (And I'm an Ayrshireman myself btw)Anyone who wants a reasonable factional account try Tranters the Wallace. It has all the myths and legends, although even it tries too hard to paint bruce as a good guy rather than a landgrabbing Norman who cared little for the people of 'his' country of Scotland.If you want the real truth try one of the many Factual books just out, but don't waste your time or money on this. Hire the video instead."
2,I wish...,"..I could say I loved the book as much as the movie but unfortunately, that's not the case. I always prefer books over movies so having seen this excellent movie a billion times (more or less), I decided to read the book. Talk about being disappointed! If I hadn't seen the movie first, this book would have been discarded after chapter one but instead, I just kept reading and hoping the story would pick up eventually. Alas, it just dragged on and on. I wonder if Mel Gibson read this book before making the movie? If he had, I think he would agree, his script is way off Mister Wallace's version of the event's which took place in Scotland. A lot of people who reviewed this book seemed to like it but I can only be honest in my opinion by saying I didn't like it and I suggest you stick to the movie version just for the action scenes alone."
3,Shoes are Great!,"The shoes came to me in excellent condition; however, there was no mention that they were patent leather as I was looking for regular. Nonetheless, I like them and they are really cute and match the outfit, I bought them for, perfectly!"
5,Great story for an aspiring vet.,this is a great book for a young person trying to decide on a career as a veterinarian. It is down to earth and gives the student a very realistic picture of the training and life of a vet.
1,Wolo 402 trumpet air horn.,This item is certainly over rated. It has a very tinny sound and is definitely not louder than the original equipment horns. I cannot recommend that anyone else should buy this item.
5,Simply ideal,"This isn't ""simply ideal"" for your Baccarat, but if you have loads of inexpensive stemware and need more storage space, this is an ideal product. It fits under the kitchen cabinet perfectly, frees up an entire shelf in the cabinet above, and is easy to install.Most stemware will fit in these slots, but do measure your stemware base before purchasing, then physically test it before installing to be sure it will side in and out easily. Also, hold the rack up onto the base of the cabinet prior to installing and test that your stemware comes in and out easily. You may find that you need to scoot the rack further back. On our cabinets (old), the stemware rack needed to extend a little further down for ease of use, so we glued a little wood piece on the top and used longer screws to attach. Installation took five minutes, tops."
1,amazon promotes animal fighting,"Dear Mr Bezos,I am sure that you yourself do not advocate dogfighting and animal cruelty and that you do not want that to bethe image that Amazon is known for. Sadly though you areendorsing this actjust by selling these products that promote aviolent and debased culture.Maybe you are not familiar with its nature and have not heard ofhow they force the animals to breed with ""r**e stands"" and howthey abuse the animals to make them ""tough fighters"" then killthem when they lose. Maybe Amazon doesnt mind these practices oreven enjoys them.Sice I have no way of knowing I will be buying my products fromyour competitors from now on until you stop selling or offeringproducts that are solely devoted to illegal or violentactivities."
3,Disappointing,"This book shows some nice examples of marker renderings BUT what it lacks is step-by-step instruction of the process. ""Guest Artists"" present examples of their work along with a lot of verbage, too much in fact for a book about graphics... so what you have is an end-result (example rendering/s) coupled with longwinded written descriptions about technique. Yuck. Given the glowing reviews here for this book, I was shocked at how disapponting it was. I tried to change my rating to 2-stars but apparently one cannot go back and edit that part of the review. First book I have ever returned to Amazon."
1,"Great movie, lousy dub.","The copy I got of this movie is an obvious dub from an interlaced tape. It does not show well on a home theater screen; the picture quality is less than standard broadcast. Nowhere near ""normal"" DVD quality.But the real corker is the sound. Not only was it not stereo, but it was out of synch with the picture by upwards of a second through most of the picture. That completely wrecks the movie experience.If you get the same disk I did you will most certainly be disappointed.I can only echo others-- ""Fox, Where Are You?"""
5,Underwear that doesn't ride even when pulled up.,"As a bigger guy (280, 6'3), I had a lot of trouble finding underwear that I could pull up and not have it jackknife in my crotch. Unlike the white Jockey and most other brands, the legs are longer and the elastic there is perfect. Not too tight to leave red marks on your things but not loose enough that you end up with a wedgie after 5 steps. I highly recommend these underwear for larger men who are at least 6 foot tall."
1,Poorly Designed and Weak,"The first thing I noticed when removing the feeder from the box was how thin and weak the metal was, the squirrels bent it back and forth as they entered and exited the feeder.In less than six weeks the plastic in the feeder was broken into three pieces by the squirrels.I certainly can not recommend this feeder to anyone."
3,This could have been much better.,"Raife's novel could have been much better. I felt cheated by the lack of emotional depth shown by this heroine who jumps into an adulterous affair with the first man she comes across. Then straining credibility we learn her long-lost sister is also involved with a married man. Finally, when Sally moves out on her own, she picks up with an old beau, also married. It gets to be a bit obsessive and I began to wonder if for Raife there is any other category of man. Either this author is trying to prove that adultery is commonplace or this is her own personal fetish. What saves the book is the development of her heroine's adolescent obsession with someone else's husband into a real relationship which requires her to grow and sacrifice herself for the man whose life has been destroyed."
3,naughty gift,"my bf was wondering about anal, so I thought this would be best for him since it has the suction cup on the base...he would be able to play and still use his hands, he loves it."
4,I really love their writing style,"I really enjoy the writing style of Steven Forrest and Jodie Forrest. It's very easy to understand and entertaining. My only real complaint with this book is that aspects are not included or discussed at all. I understand that the book is already fairly lengthy, so this may have been why. I would love for them to write Skymates III Composite Aspects."
4,Relatively accurate,"I bought one of these for my girlfriend... THEN read the reviews! In my opinion it appears to work fairly well. The sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage. To the far left seems to work best for 'normal' walking. As I said, in terms of accuracy, I think it's pretty good. The radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5' stars. The sound is ""tinny""; it's NOT stereo; there's NO frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size! Though overall, when comparing price to features... this little fella will probably suit your needs. If you already have a Walkman (or don't care about audio) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet."
3,"I like some of the songs, basically...","...it sounds like kind of crappy Beck, with a Japanese chick and robot voices. Japanese chicks are hot and robot voices are cool. I like the songs with the Japanese chick and the robot voices. The song ""Disposable Parts"" rocks like no other. The song ""High Society"" sucks."
5,A MUST HAVE BOOK!!!,"Jeremy's book is AWESOME!, He takes you with him on his journey from Discouraged to Totally FIT and Happy. This book includes everything you ever wanted or need to know about Diet, Exercise and how to put it all together to succeed. I own many books from my days of teaching Aerobics, but this book is my all time favorite. Do yourself a favor and invest in this book, It will be the last Fitness book you will ever need to buy. Jeremy Is highly respected in his field and through his book he will inspire, motivate, and encourage you with knowledge that you can trust."
4,classic freestyle of highest caliber,"Most of this record was produced by Lewis Martinee who produced hits for Expose (Point of No Return, Come Go With Me) and Pet Shop Boys (Domino Dancing). ""I Want You"" totally captures the 80s electronic spirit of mixing a drum machine tick beat with very honest, pleading vocals typical of freestyle songs. Most of this album is very good. A few tracks suck. I don't know what Shana is up to these days. I few years ago I happened to stop by Vision Records in Miami and there everyone said they had lost track of her. This is not an r&b record as this site may say; this is pure Miami-styled freestyle, very different than a lot of the Puerto Rican styled freestyle that was coming out NYC at that time; a little more house or four-to-the-floor oriented."
5,who shana is now!!,"for anyone wondering what ever ""happend"" to shana the singer of this cd she's now known as ""shana petrone"", i saw her website a while back and they sead she had a dance album and sead it was this album ""i want you"" that i know of her new sound is country??, sooo thats where ""shana"" is now. oh and this cd is good to!. very retro, very freestyle. if you can i say look for her cassete singles as well. the songs i want you and you cant get away are or were on cassete single. they have mixes on them there that are very old skool and very hard to find now adays."
1,no more snow,"In this story Joan Somers is secretary to Brandt Lyon, handsome, successful owner of Lyon Construction company. Joan has harbored a secret crush on Brandt for years but he has never noticed her because she hides behind conservative attire, hairstyles, and glasses. Then just the two of them become snowed in together at the office for the weekend and with no power they have to keep each other warm. Sounds more prurient than it really gets --- they end the snow-in with Brandt just realizing that Joan is much more attractive than he had realized. Seems to me they spend the rest of their time bickering ---Joan acting prudish and Brandt acting macho.For whatever reason, I didn't think they had any chemistry and could barely finish this book."
2,Haven't we read this all before?,"Street cool characters drink, do drugs and have a lot of group sex - then the protagonist decides there must be more to life than that.Well, yeah.This novel aspires to Camus ""L'Etranger"" but without the philosophical underpinning we're left with pure derivation. There's the same tone of voice, the same sensuousness of description, the same criticism of contemporary values, but no ideas beneath the surface. Given the 20 year gap, Murakami can be more graphic than Camus, but painting the vomit in greener tones only makes things more cartoon-like."
5,This interesting mystery will keep the pages turning.,"The Demon in the Teahouse is the riveting sequel to the Ghost in the Taikado Inn. This book is irrisistable with the many suttle details all leading to different people. The books plot is seamless and all of the clues do add up in the end. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction, mystery or suspense, or asian culture.Before reading this book however I would recomend the Ghost in the Taikado Inn. This first book is also excellent and will help you understand everything in the second book."
4,A surprising inaccuracy,"I must start by saying I thought this book was wonderful. I found it to be a very intriguing mystery that really sucks you in. I was literally unable to put it down. Even though it is intended for readers younger than I, I still greatly enjoyed it.However, I was disappointed to see that the authors refer to the chracter Umae as a ""tayu"" or ""top ranking geisha"" This is not correct. A Tayu is NOT a geisha, top ranking or otherwise. In fact, Tayu are courtesans or prostitutes. Ignoring this inaccuracy, this book was a real pleasure to read and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys fun mysteries!"
3,A Different Facet Of Liv,"This is a US release of the original european CD. It is, for the most part, experimental and sparse with a number of cuts that have a techno feel. Good Vibes, Bad Vibes is the best of those. 3a.m. shows Liv's vocal range the best. There are also a couple of cuts that draw from Norwegian fokelore. The best song on the disc is In The Heart Of Juliet, which is something that could be in heavy rotation on any soft rock radio station. This is a side of Liv that is markedly different from her other material."
2,Wobbly fan,"I could only find two fans this size for wall mounting. Unfortunately, it is wobbly. On low speed it is not too bad. But at mid or high speed it is very noisy, rattling against the wall. I think the center axle is slightly off-center, but it could be the plastic blades that screw onto it. I am planning to call the manufacturer to see if they will exchange it."
3,Wall mounted fan,"Since it is hard to find a small fan that mounts to a wall, we decided to go with this one. It looks good but on high speed, it is extremely noisy. We can hear it vibrate through the wall and into other bedrooms and across a hall."
2,the word commercial should not be in the name of this fan,"This fan is Wallmart quality junk, the word commercial should not be in the name of this fan. I wanted to return it but it was not at all easy to figure out how to return it and when I did figure it out there is only a 21 day return policy."
1,Air King wall fan,I am extremly disappointed with this fan.The Electrician had it installed before I could stop him.Instead of being white...it has a yellowish tint to it....like it had been in a smokers house.The fan if very very loud....my husband took it apart...the grey fan blade is broken and missing a part.I will have to call the manufacturer to get it replaced.My $15.00 fan from Kmart sounds and looks better than this one.Cynthia Olyer
5,Most delicious bars I've ever tasted...,"I LOVE these bars, and they have become my new favorite treat. They are better than any candy bar I've ever tasted and even non-dieting family members are stealing and eating them all the time. I've tried many of the flavors and this is the only one I felt very strongly about. The other flavors were mediocre at best, but this chocolate peanut butter bar is DELICIOUS and is FAR better-tasting than other brands of nutrition bars like South Beach Diet bars or Balance bars. While the nutritionals might be slightly worse than SBD bars, the taste is just amazing. The only downside of the bars is you may find it hard to restrict yourself to one a day for a breakfast or a treat, and may want to eat them all the time, ruining any diet."
4,An ejoyable compilation,"Not only for kids... at least not only for the thumpers. If you have a fresh soul, you will enjoy this CD, though I liked more the title from the collection of NatGeo ""Around the World Christmas: The World Rejoices""... and two years ago my kid agreed with me. This year, my little daughter will give her vote.Xmas come... so, be prepared!"
2,unoriginal,"Lirel is not a very interesting character. I was thinking that she wasn't well described, but I think Elaine Cunningham did a very good job at describing a very boring person.The books major problem is that it is formula drive and there is nothing original about it. The bad guys are more interesting, but it's not written so we should care about them. If there was no Lirel and the book was about everyone else, then I would have like to see who came out ahead even thought they are all scum.The books first 10 pages are tbe best. It slowy goes downhill, but the las 100 pages are unbearable. Why does she have to make the story end like a hollywood movie?"
3,Several songs from &#65533;Romanza&#65533;; stronger on the latter,"No offense to Andrea Bocelli, though. Four of the songs on this, his official debut album, appear on ""Romanza,"" and to tell you the truth, I was ready to get this album and ""Bocelli"" in an attempt to make my Andrea Bocelli album collection complete. Since I already have ""Romanza,"" though, neither this one nor ""Bocelli"" is really necessary."
1,A poorly executed transcription of what could have been .,"Bocelli's voice was almost totally overwhelmed by the orchestral accompaniementParticularly annoying to me was the loud piano work which almost totally drowned out Bocelli's voice. I had heard one of his other CDs and it was very good. This one was not technically correct. I bought the CD to listen to his Tenor voice, not the over loud background music which was NOT background at all. John Kane"
3,Contents barely sufficient for clearing the exams....,"I Barely passed the desktop exams a Few days back. Only reading this book will Not Help U pass the exams, It lacks in covering some of the very important objectives for the exam, like ADO and COM, The writer could have emphasized more on testing and debugging Components and on Deployment. The Questions at the end of the chapter are too straightforward and simple.CD contains practice exams which are worthless. Well, But This book is the best among all the other books available for the purpose,It might serve the purpose If u use MSDN to go with It.. Wish U all the best"
4,Thoroughly study this book and you&#65533;ll pass.,"I passed 70-176 about a week or two ago. This book was 90% of my preparation efforts. I supplemented the book slightly with the MSDN Library which is available on the MSDN website. I didn't use the Transcender tests, but I can definitely see where they would be valuable in preparing for the test. (I just didn't want to spend $200 on something I would likely never use again after the test). This book, however, is great as a reference and as a study guide. I would have given it five stars but it is very weak on Packaging and Deployment, as everyone else has said. Really, Really study this book (that means LEARN, not become acquainted with) and you should be fine."
3,over sized vb manual good for basics,"This book is way to big to study for the exam.It does cover most of the topics related to vb and serves quite ok as a vb reference book for the basics.But for the exam go Foxall.This may help for stuff like the Treeview controls and menu bars but is too fat to digest before the exam.And yes the practice test that come with it , well they just s**k.The answers are wrong and some question's topics are not even covered in the book"
2,"This book is full of errors, doesn't worth the money","This book is full of errors; if you try to prepare for an MCP exam, use it with caution. When I used it, I always had to use MSDN, because there are few pages without *serious* errors. Numerous code examples in this book won't even compile with VB; it's only advantage is the hierarchy of topics, which really helps you to find the necessary things in MSDN. I wouldn't buy this book for 50-60 dollars."
4,great book for reviewing before taking exams,"The book is good overall, especially for 175 exam. BUT there're a lot of errors in text and in practice exams. The questions in practice test are too simple, you're not gonna find questions like that on the actual exam. This book does not replace the experience. After I took both test and passed them, I'm sure that without my experience in VB I woudln't pass them. This book helped me with reviewing some things that I forgot or never used. It does a good job explaining all aspects of both exams."
4,Great work with holes,"The book moves you much closer to the objective of passing the exam. I think it is an invaluable tool. However there are holes where the author could have spent more time. The strength of the book is the review questions, exercises and exam questions at end of each chapter. However I found a few of the questions to be ambiguous and I think one of them was even repeated (chapter 4 #16 and #22). You can't go wrong with this book, but you have to be good enough and attentive to read some of the material with a grain of salt. I don't want to take too much away from the book because it is excellent."
1,TOO MUCH for my 3 year old,"i was drawn to this book - in the picture book section of the kids room at the library - due to the alternative illustrations and funky type of the book, and because other books by this author have been very heart warming. Perused it a bit and thought the friendship btwn two injured animals in a way that improved life for the both of them seemed an inspiring tale. Got all into it with my just turned 3 year old and felt horrible for exposing him to Fox's cruelty. Seems more appropriate for a young adult book or even adult. I find the meanness in many kids books very disheartening - not what i want to introduce my young son too. The world is intense enough eventually - i'd like to give him some years of feeling like the world is a good and safe place where he can thrive."
1,Inappropriate for a children's book,I felt dirty after reading this book to my 3 year old. The author seems to be working out some kind of betrayal issue that seems inappropriate for a children's book.The imagery is dark and the writing appears to be scrawled by a semi-literate serial killer.
4,Good stuff and damn near UnAmerican.,"MI-5, Volumes 1 and 2Any and all parts of MI-5 are worth your seeing. The show brought the play write to television. MI-5 is a super smart series about global law enforcement and how national security services and their varied interest bump into each other. ""This is Really Good stuff."""
4,No Ending In Sight,"the game is good but as you play it and advance in your chosen job, It becomes near impossible to get the top job. It requires you to have so many friends that it is more work than it is worth. Since you can never reach the top the game eventually becomes monotonous since it has no ending. Then the game turns into a good past time but no longer a great game. Other than that it is a good game."
5,So Additing!,I play the sims every day so I know what I'm talking about when I say THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! Some parents might not let thier kids play this game but that is up to whoever is buying the game. I have gotten every one of my friends addicted to this game now that they all have a coppy. I agree some times the sims can get stuck but you can get them out of theys situations very easily. I have every expansion pack accept for hot date and house party. I hope you enjoy The Sims! I am a kid.
4,Fun...slow fun...,"Being that it's the first edition, it's obviously quite slow to load new screens. Aside from that, I absolutely enjoy buliding the houses and creating the characters. It is fun how one application can benefit another, like how the magic application helps in the celebrity edition. I like it better than the newer editions because sometimes simpler is better. I recommend this product!"
2,boring routine,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be a fun workout, different from what I normally do. However, I got bored doing this dvd. The main motion is swaying your hips. You pretty much do this the whole time while sometimes moving side to side and alternating leg movements. There isn't much varaition to the arm movements at all either. I felt all I was doing was stepping into place with a little extra hip movement.The steps weren't terribly hard to follow, and the energy of the instructor is good. It's about a 35 minute workout total, and there is also a tutorial about 15 minutes long that goes over the steps. I did the tutorial before starting, although I think you could jump right into the workout and still be okay.This isn't a very strenous workout, and it's very repetitive. I do not see myself doing this dvd again and wish I wouldn't have bought it."
3,"Very rudamentary dancing, easy, relaxed pace","I rented this online. I love dance workouts which I feel I can learn to be more fluid/graceful in my movements, learn some new moves & doesn't feel like exercising!This had very rudimentary, boring movements. The music wasn't motivating either at all. Stella has enthusiasm but dances stiffly w/most of the other girls & the intention here mostly is to tone/lose weight rather then to be more relaxed & flow with the dancing.This dvd is only for those new to exercising, for light days for anyone who exercises more then 1x/week & only for those who have 2 left feet or are shy to try real dance workouts.Previews at:collagevideo com w/reviewsyoutube from totalfitnessdvds"
5,Great Quick Cardio Workout!!!!,"I just love this ""sizzling salsa"" workout. Its fast, fun and effective. Works great on those weight training days."
5,Salsational Slimnastics!,"I love salsa, latin music and this video! Aerobic exercise is something that I am learning to like and it's videos like these that help me like this thing that is becoming necessary in my life more. While some of the transitions are not the smoothest, this video is actually fairly easy; it gives you a great workout and teaches you some steps you could actually use at a Salsa Night or when you go out to the Club! I use it often and just know you will too!"
5,Fun Salsa workout,"Seemed to get a pretty decent cardio workout from this DVD. The choreography was fun, and it was a treat having Maria Foreo as a participant, not teacher. Actually, I kept my eye on her rather than the instructor, as she does everything really well.The teacher explains the choreography really well, it doesn't drag, and you can work as hard or easy as you wish."
3,Watch works well; but recommend a pass for coaches,"The watch works great, and would be a five-star watch, except for one item that may warrant a pass. The watch does not calculate the ""final"" split when you stop the watch (e.g., if timing a relay, using the splits, you will get the times of the first three swimmers, and the final time, but it will not provide the final swimmers time--you'll need math for that). Seems like a poor oversight from the creators of the watch."
2,Not that great.,"I guess they are made in China or something. Came in a broken wooden box. I drilled a couple things, then traded the rest of the lot for a couple beers and a wrench."
4,Sow's Ear to Silk Purse,"A.J. Verdelle tells the compelling story of a young girl who is destined to become a working class drudge just like her mother until the intervention of an uncompromising educator who recognizes her brilliance. Miss Pearson inspires Denise to shrug off her country ways and don the mantle of the educated, but the task is not completed before an addition to the family threatens Denise's further education.The Good Negress is an earthy coming of age story whose realism took me back to some of my grandmother's favorite sayings and doings. The only disappointment was the disjointed flashbacks which make the story choppy at times. Still, the language is lyrical and the characters amazingly drawn."
1,Do not buy,"This was actually a gift and I feel bad my sister had to waste her money. This was not at all worth buying. Upon opening this toy, the box was already falling apart. The Gizmo it self was disappointing, the ears,hands and plastic feet were poorly glued on. One of the hands was dangling. The eyes were cock-eyed and the mouth piece was also poorly glued on. It just seems the final execution of this toy was over looked. There was glue residual causing the fur to look flat not plushy!and parts of the seems were sticking out. This was a gift for my daughter and when she held it in her hands her smile quickly turned into a sad face and she didn't think twice running away from it. In my book it deserves half a star not one/."
2,Not happy,"I bought a Gizmo when the movie first came out. It was all material and plush. Even had a sqeaker in it.The one I recieved today has hard plastic ears and the head is a hard box.I wanted a Gizmo for my grand child to cuddle,not poke her in the eyes with the ears.I will be sending this back. and looking for the original Gizmo.I'm very dissatified with this product."
3,too small,"I enjoyed the product, but I thought it was more like a regular stuffed animal and a lot larger or should I say wider. I had one before this one that got ruined in one of the many floods we had and it was about 12 or more inches tall. Maybe like the size of a doll. If there are any that size that I could purchase could you please let me know.Shelley Chauvin"
2,Lemme say not worth it,"I know its for collection purposes, but for god sakes dont get it. The game itself is mediocre. Please just buy a ps3 amd a xbox 360 or Wii just buy something worth your while rather than having a piece of used plastic to be used as bragging rights...."
1,Communist Propaganda,"People like Ram Puniyani are known Communist propagandists, who are working overtime against Indian Religions, and Traditions. People like this, by their one sided denigration is causing immense crack to the Socially derived Tolerance, unique to Indian Society.These are throughly Westernised people, who have little clue to Gandhi, Tagore, Bankimchandra or other Great Indian Nationalists. Being totally urban people, they have little idea how tolerance works."
5,Great read,"Having found this referred to in several publications about native plants and their medicinal and food usage I decided to buy this. It's what I was expecting. Very terse, with short (2 or 3 sentences) about each plant, listed by latin name. It includes the parts of the plants that are usable, and which tribes (or regions) they were used by. The book lists funguses, mushrooms, edible berries, plants with edible roots, and more than you'd ever expect. Some of the names have changed in the last 63 years, but the new names are not hard to find."
2,I didn't like this book,"Sorry to be the spoiler at the party and while I don't enjoy writing bad reviews I do it occasionally when I feel what I got for the price of the book was a waste. I gave the book two stars not one because the author writes well and is engaging. Having said that, this book is just a bunch of stories that don't tie together in a workable narrative. I learned nothing and only skimmed the last half of the book. If you like listening to other moms tell cute stories about what their kids do then you'll enjoy this book. If you expect more or to learn something about imagination and creativity look elsewhere.A better insight into what the book contains would have saved me time and money."
4,"If the author knows about leadership, why's he not a general","Seriously though, this book is a great practical guide for the NCO or junior officer. Most leadership books talk about such broad concepts such as initiative or integrity (which are important) but this one talks about real hands on techniques that'll help the military leader win in battle."
5,Fun for the family,My 4 year old and 6 year old want to listen to Junie B. Jones tapes every night and while on car trips. They started with an audiotape and soon were asking us to read all 16 books from the library. Very fun stories for kids and grownups alike. Barbara Parks has a wonderful sense of humor.
5,Wish I had bought this sooner! Perfect for Phil & Ted's,"I'm not sure when this became available, but I wish I had purchased it a long time ago. We've had the Phil & Ted's double stroller and I purchased the Protect a Bub shade for the lower, tandem part of the stroller and it's a must have, in my opinion. While I love our Phil & Ted's stroller, it has always driven me crazy that the upper shade/canopy is pretty much worthless regarding sun protection. This product fits beautifully and comes down fully to offer great protection. I also like that it's flexible enough to keep it attached to the stroller, just lift it back and put my son into it, then pull the cover down again. Definitely recommend this if you have a Phil & Ted's. I would guess it would be good for other brands, too."
3,Works ok,"This is an ok product. It creates a little extra shade, but my 10 month old still gets sun on his legs and the sides don't shield the sun at all. The product takes way too long to put on a stroller. Instead of ties it should have been velcro."
2,Not bad...,"Since the above review from the ""Californian Doctor"" was obviously planted by their label I thought I would put my own two cents in. My boss picked up a single of these guys when she was in Australia and I warmed to ity so I gave the album a listen and...it's certainly no worse than the pop-punk plastered all over the air-waves here. Support some kids from down under and give this disc a spin..."
4,Hunter's Law,"This story is engrossing and hard to put down. Annalee is an interesting character that is well rounded. She is like a real person, who trouble seems to follow no matter how well meaning her actions and reasons are. Hunter is a ""real man"" and embodies the attitude that men are always right. He becomes more human and lovable as the story progresses. This is a book that made look into the other stories in the guardsman series."
1,"GROSS A LITTLE BETTER HERE, BUT STILL UNJUSTLY DEFAMES THE TORTURED POLES.","I am just Grossly, Grossed out by Gross' Gross books. I am sick and tired, and emotionally drained of Gross' over-the-top, sensationlistic and unsubstanciated ramblings, that are more ""dis""- proven each day. Example: Look at gross' Jedwabne, started with 1600, now down to ""200"" actual bodies exhumed, filled with German bullets. Get a life. Gross is synonymous with ""dark, depressing and drudgery reading. Why did I bother?"
3,AN Ok Album,Hes is a better producer than a Rapper... This is Album is good..I suggest buying something in the lines of MR. Lil One..
5,POINTSWEST knows what they are doing,I've been a fan of good rock/emo for years and it's been awhile since I've heard such ingenuity and powerfulness!The guitar work on this albums is pristine and the beat is like a kick in the teeth.BUY THIS ALBUM!-Slow Devil
3,Basic,"Good for the basic understanding of the text. Sometimes there is more depth given, but there is a lot of fly over."
3,This may be biased,"I was pressured into reading this book by my poetry and advanced composition professors. This is not a book to sit down and read through. It is more of a textbook style with small writing but many examples for the topics (meter, syntax, voice, etc.). Causing the chapters to span well over ten pages, Wolosky goes into detail about each topic. There are cool extras such as a table of contents, index, and glossary, but these just add to the ""textbook"" idea. Good book, but not something to read in your free time. (Not if you want an understanding of it)"
4,Excellent Product,The Product is very good.........the only problem with my purchase is that it was little bit cracked at one corner.....But i decided to keep it any way......otherwise product is very good.
5,Phanton Of The Opera at the Royal Hall-25th Anniversary Celebration,A fantastic celebration of the 25th Anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera. A great cast and wonderful recording of the production. Well worth watching and adding to your DVD collection.
5,"Great performance, loved avery minute of it.","Kristine was the best, acting was superb. The stage production and the orchestra was great. The weakest was the Phantom himself. Maybe because Michael Crawford was so good, and no one comes close in singing and in performance. Michael doesn't have the best voice but in Phantom he was second to none. The Blu Ray version is incredible. The encore was a nice surprise, to bad that one of guests could not sing (Don't want to reveal who it was). Highly recommend to have it in your collection."
4,Forget the 2004 film and watch this instead.,"I've never had the chance to see POTO live on stage, and until now my only exposure to the show was random Youtube clips, and also the 2004 Hollywood version (which was...disappointing, to say the least). If you can't make it to the live show, get this version. Ramin Karimloo's performance alone is worth the price-- he blows me away! The rest of the cast is good as well, particularly Sierra Boggess, whom I think is even better than Sarah Brightman.The staging isn't perfect, but at least it IS staged. I'm not too sure how I feel about the screens in the background-- I don't think that was an ideal choice --but most of the time I didn't notice them because I was too wrapped up in the music.Also, I'm a big Les Mis fan, so seeing Colm Wilkinson, John Owen-Jones, and Anthony Warlow during the encore was a really great moment."
5,"Outstanding performance of ""Phantom of the Opera!",We were fortunate to see this musical at Her Majestys Theatre in London this past June and loved it. The DVD was a great reminder of how much we enjoyed the live performance.
5,phantom is supreme,"This is yet another in the long line of great phantom music. The costumes are supurb, the staging is very unique, and the colors are fantastic. All together it is a visual delight for the eye and a wonder for the eye. Any phantom fan or a phantom first timer will revel in its sound and beauty."
2,ERRRRRRRRRRR,"Well, mayabe I am Phantom-ed Out.VEry pretty and of course, beautifully done, but for those of us who discovered the one and only original...anything is a little bit of a let down."
5,great music and show,I saw this musical many times at ny. it is great watching again at home. best one and I like it
5,Better than the Phantom movie.,Better than the movie because it is actually the play. A friend said it was wonderful so I bought it. And it was wonderful. I saw the play in Boston many years ago and absolutely loved it - this was the next best thing to being there.
5,Phantom of the Opera,DVD was a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it. She saw the DVD on PBS during the Christmas season
3,Wish I had caught this on PBS...could have saved some money,"I missed this when it aired in the theaters and it aired on PBS right after I had purchased it and it was on its way to me. I wish I had seen it on PBS as I would not have bothered ordering it. In a few words, I don't really care for it. I won't elaborate but suffice to say I much prefer the movie version with Gerard Butler. I've seen the live musical 5 times and each of those times were much better than this version. Didn't like the performers nor the sets. The orchestra was the only redeeming facet. I'll keep it I guess for the heck of it but can't imagine ever watching it again."
5,25th anniv of Phantom of the Opera,"Always been a fan of ""Phantom"", but takes the performance to a new level. The best part is the Grand Finale, where Sara Bright man sinds with four past Phantom's. Michael Crawford also makes an appearance but doesn't sing."
5,Standing Ovation,"Hollywood has no business making movies out of broadway plays, they ruin them. Thankfully, the 25th Anniversary of Phanthom of the Opera at Alpert Hall simply puts the cameras focusing on the actual stage production. There are no gimmicks, no CGI, and no film special effects. What transpires in front of you is only the talents of the actors, the director, the set designer and the orchestra. This movie is magic...simply the best production of Phanthom of the Opera I have ever seen (and I've seen many). I have already watched this DVD six times, and I'm sure I will watch many, many more."
3,DVD not for the USA,"I received a Double Play. The package contained two discs, the Blu-ray worked fine, but the DVD wouldn't play. It said,""Invalid Region Code"". Not only was the region code invalid, but this was a PAL encoded disc, the UK version, so its no good in the USA."
4,Glad to have this,"Pros:-nice to have this on DVD as a theatrical production instead of motion picture-music was very good-had even more dancers, and special solos than original-nice tribute the the Phantom & Andrew Lloyd Webber at the endCons:-not exactly true to original- the lack of a true set was disappointing. the led screens as backdrops just didn't do this play justice-the rise of the chandelier is my favorite part, and this is missing.Overall:Love the play, happy I bought it just not as good as seeing the full show. Wish they could have done the chandelier, it is such an amazing opening sequence"
4,Review of Real Estate Investment Trusts,"This book contains a collection of 18 different articles about REITs. The book is somewhat dated, so readers will need to take that into account when consulting this book. The articles are generally useful. There are articles from the perspective of REIT boards(e.g. 10. REIT Governance for Directors and Trustees), management (7. REITs and Commercial Lenders: The Evolving Relationship), investors (14. Financial Analysis of REIT securities), and institutional investors (17. REIT Investment: The Pension Fund Perspective)."
2,Water for spraying cats with.,"This is an $8.00, 12 oz. bottle of what is, by smell and taste tests, just water. It is meant to be applied via spray nozzle to your cat, an animal which is traditionally disinclined to be made wet. Don't spray your cat with water; it's cruel.Two stars for chutzpah."
3,"Machine good, Ice cream marginal","We made the ""French Vanilla"" recipe verbatim from the little manual. The machine churned the liquid to ice cream within 20 minutes, and we stopped it about 5 minutes later (when it was very thick). The ice cream at that instant was incredible. However, placing the bulk of it in the freezer in an air tight container resulted in hardened ice cream, but the ice cream tasted like freezer burned ice cream (as if it was full of ice crystals). The machine is great, but not eaten immediately the ice cream doesn't hold a candle to gourmet store-bought ice cream."
4,Don't let the cover deceive you.,"I took this book on a cruise with me, but was not too interested in reading it because I thought the book was a rehash of the lives of Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne, two subjects that we know enough about. I was pleasantly surprised. This is truly a book about little known stars. I was pleased to see Fredi Washington,one of my favorites. A page turner, you won't want to put it down."
4,Excellent movie about the amazing conductor John Phillip Sousa,"What a great movie this is. Clifton Webb plays the great American conductor John Phillip Sousa. Everyone has heard the famous songs that Sousa wrote and conducted. This movie highlights his contributions to these famous songs while conducting the USMC Marching Band and later his own band. many great scenes highlight this film but my personal favorite is how he was inspired to write his signature ballad ""Stars and Stripes Forever"". A young Robert Wagner plays an energetic youthful Tuba player who falls in love with one of Sousa's singers. What a great movie that can be watched over and over again. Highly Recommended!"
5,Love This! Great For 2-Handed Tasks!,"I use this to work on computers (no more fumbling with a flashlight), work around the house (great in the basement, barn or garage), and just about anything else. The Xenon bulb really goes far, too! Perfect for those distance-spots."
2,Soviet Gas Mast,"This is a good quality SOVIET gas mask but it is not East German. It has Cyrillic script all over it and the inside of the carrier which is Soviet Army issue materials. If you want an East German mask, this is close, but not the same."
4,Love It!!,"I love Betty Wright. As a child I listen to the songs of her,gladys, patti, and all of the great ones. As an adult I appreciate the words..... NO Pain No Gain.... ""In order to get something, you gotta give something In order to be something you gotta go through something"" What more can you say after that....."
4,An unlikely but very successful comeback album.,"Betty Wright enjoyed a career revival thanks to such hits as ""No Pain, No Gain"" and ""After The Pain"". With this album, Betty proved that you could still create and record REAL soul music and find success with it. The only songs I did not like were ""Ms. Time"" and ""Miami Groove"" --the rest of the album, however, is nothing short of superb."
3,Pretty good clock,"If you are not particular and just want an alarm clock with 2 seperate alarms and a nap feature than buy this and you will be happy. For those of you who are very particular about features and very noise sensitive ect. read on...I didn't like the fact that the radio dial is on the left side, most alarm clocks have them in the front and there is no reason this one doesn't. The other thing I didn't like about it is the radio, when I set it for the alarm clock, it I want a very tiny noise to try and wake me it does not work. The lowest volume on the radio is very low, but not tiny on the noise level. ALso the buttons on top of the alarm are not so easy to use as they are very small. I like and recommend the Timex model T-228b. Good luck."
1,Worked for less than a week,"Bought this alarm clock and less than a week later it started making a constant loud humming noise, going to try to return it."
3,A Bummer,"With its 4 buttons in the rear, much harder to set than the previous model, which after several years of good service fell on the floor & broke. My wife, for whom I bought the new model, doesn't like the 24 hour time face instead of a.m./p.m.which the older model had.This morning, after several days of performing well, the alarm mysteriously went off at 6.a.m., although it hadn't been set to do so. Furthermore, the date calendar now records the year as 2013. In short, if LaCrosse is going to produce a new model, they should make sure it's an improvement over the old one."
1,unpredictable,"I liked the clear numbers but trying to set it is a nightmare, the back buttons are too close together & too easy to misuse. The back light is very dim & again almost impossible to find to use. Since I have had it the alarm has gone off twice unset, the hour-time numbers are moving erratically forward & back, not staying in time for more than 30 minutes. Very weird. I will try a new battery but am very disappointed with this clock since it is a decent size & looks good.Would not suggest anyone buy it. Could be possible I got a lemon."
5,Skrape,skrape is one of the best cd's ive heard since disturbed. their style is totaly unsurpassed by any band in the music biz. this should be a must-have for anyone that likes listening to good stuff.
2,"youve heard ""isolated""-youve heard it all","""isolated"" pretty much sums up the whole cd.great track, but everything else lacks good musical form.this album doesn't feel mastered either.it seems like they wanted to get something out to the public as fast as they could, and dint take time to refine other songs.they can do much better.hopefully."
5,awesome!!!,I can't say enough good about this knife I love it. I use this for filleting large salmon and butchering deer. great quality and feel!!
3,Mediocre At Best,"The size was fine. I ordered a small and am 5'5'' and it fits well. However, the sleeve length is short (about 3/4 sleeve) and they mailed me the wrong color. The fabric is acceptable considering the price of the leo, but it is not as breathable as other, more expensive options."
2,"very small, also very thick","I received this leotard in record time, but found it extremely small. I am a size 3, maybe a 5 tops, and 5'4"". I ordered a medium and it was TINY. Also, the material is very thick."
5,UNA ESTUPEDA PIEZA MUSICAL,"Una vez mas esta artista que tiene a su paso una carrera de más de 20 años nos regala el mejor disco inspiracional y de música cristiana femenino de los últimos años.Una vez más demuestra que su talento,voz e interpretación son inigualables por ninguna cantante latina."
5,Best Martial Arts Movie in Awhile,"Some of the best fighting since Kiss of the Dragon and Crouching Tiger. We found a real life Ryu, hes black, and he's named Michael Jai White.I hope I don't spoil is but Kimbo Slice is in this movie, Gina Carano (Crush), Rufio, need I go on?"
5,great pulls,"I ordered these pulls to match the Kenilworth knobs and they worked out beautifully. They feel solid when pulling and the finish looks great -- dark enough without the ""rubbed"" look taking over."
1,Just an opinion.,"The story itself was not so bad, but what I really disliked about this story was learning Monk had no trouble with having an affair with a married woman. I really felt as if this detracted from this story."
2,Hurry through this one!,"What a disapointment. I love the William Monk series. I read Sins of the Wolf in three days and and quickly decided it was my favorite. Cain His Brother was just as compelling of a read and the details of Limehouse, the typhoid hospital and especially the chase seen were amazing. Couldn't wait to read this book, but quickly found that I couldn't wait for it to end. Ms. Perry's research on Victorian England is second to none, but I found this story in particular very forgetable. I agree with one reviewer that Hester's contribution to solving the cases is sometimes better than Monk's or Rathbone. Thank goodness Monk is finally starting to figure out that Hester's courage, friendship and brains is more attractive than beauty. Don't waste much time on this book, except to find out who did it and the next step in Monk's and Hester's relationship."
4,Tricky but adorable designs,"All the designs look so sweet and adorable.I agree that there seem to be some designs that are variations on the same theme. However, I found this helpful because they are scaled to different sizes, which makes it easier to adapt a style to size.For my first project I tried the fair isle checkered shoes from the cover. The size was perfect. Although I found a few minor counting errors in the pattern.The edging instructions produced a very different looking shoe with more of a cuff. If I were to skip the edging I would have the same style shoe as the cover. Also, the edging instructions contain extra eyelets for the ribbon and it wasn't clear how to thread them.I'm looking forward to trying some of the other bootee designs."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"My first reaction when I saw the timer was: ""what timer?"" It simply is for show, and for timing. Also, it seemed to take more than 12 hours for the yogurt to solidify; plus, there was too much liquid at the top. Overall, I am not satisfied. Now I know why it is on closeout."
1,doesn't make yogurt...,"This product just didn't work... it wouldn't make yogurt... my fiancee and I tried three times, together and separately and it just didn't work... get another brand. Excise this product and this brand from your considerations... I've never experienced anything like this--complete and utter non-functionality. What a piece of poop this is!!!"
1,Yogurt Maker?!?,"Before you buy in and purchase a contraption to ""make yogurt"".Try the old way. pour milk into a glass, leave on the counter overnight. yay yogurt."
5,I Love That Book,"If you like Todd Strasser books you will like Help Im Traped In Obedience School.I know I did. I loved it because its about people who switch places ,and one day a boy ,and a dog switch places, and the dog was suppose to go to obedience school so the kid went instead and knew everything."
2,Alternate to PSC-70,"I've heard other negative comments about the size case and found the Tamrac 5693 fits the Canon S1, and looks a lot better."
1,Not worthed at all!,"I bought this blender, and couldn't get it working until some long efforts. I basically had to press very hard on the top of it to make it working, but then I couldn't stop it. When I umplugged it, it didn't want to work again, and I had to return it.I wouldn't recomend it at all."
1,i am disappoitment with the product and the service.,this purchase experience gave me a lot of trouble. i ask to return the item theer times because of the defection of the product. now i still did not receive a good blender. i hope i can get the replacement as soon as possible. and i hope the replecement will not have trouble
1,It pays to read the reviews...........,Wish there had been some product reviews available when I bought this blender. It lasted about 3 or 4 uses and then quit. It was my first Girmi product and will probably be my last.
3,Really handy,"Cap has a tendency to become unscrewed. It's a bit large for a jeans front pocket, but not too bad. Otherwise great. Perfect fit for the glass nitroglycerin bottle."
5,Fond Memories,"This was the first YA ""Thriller"" I'd ever read. It started me on my descent into madness (aka ""the writer's life"") and holds a powerful spell over me today. Now that I'm published myself, I look back at it with fond thoughts.Well written, believable characters make this book shine. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a FUN book for the beach! Just be careful about going into the water...you never know who will have to rescue you!"
2,Let Me Whisper Plugs For Products,"Ms Clark is a producer and writer for CBS News. The news on TV has become a vehicle for advertising; perhaps this is where the author got her idea that advertisements should be generously sprinkled throughout the book. She devotes two pages plugging glass ornaments by Christopher Radko. FAO Schwarz gets three pages. Jaguar and Range Rovers get honorable mention. Various restaurants get plugs. Cookbooks, magazines and TV shows are also well represented. One character is murdered wearing a Pashmina shawl. Liquor is not generic, only Glenlivet, Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot and, the common touch, Budweiser. The blurbs go on and on.The sad thing is that the book is otherwise interesting. The writing, while not of Pulitzer quality, is good. Perhaps in future books Ms Clark will imagine herself working for PBS and can the commercials."
4,Gift for Son-in-Law,He loves Looney Tunes and couldn't wait to watch these. He was very entertained and enjoyed each of the cartoons.
2,women should stay away from soy,"I took this for awhile, the taste is bad and it did not do anything. I think whey protein works better and it doesnt exclude dieters with soy allergies or lactose intolerance."
3,Not a fan of Almased,"I ordered Almased after seeing advertising in all of the magazines that I read. I was very disappointed in the textureand taste of this product. I mixed it in a blender (as directed) with ice. It was gritty and not something I couldexist on for a diet. For the price and the hype, I expected it to be better than it was."
1,Did not like this at all.,You may loose weight on this if you can take the taste. I did not like this. I still have most of it left over.
2,Almased BS,"This supplement drink was recommended by my Mom's, ""Dibetic Doctor"". I ordered 2 cans for my Mom on line to save money. I payed$ 51.44 for her order. They were sent to her, she recieved her cans and followed the directions as explained on the pamplet,she is to drink a glass full and in 2 hours check her glucose level, it was very high so the next drink she decressed as it states her suger was higher so Mom had to stop the drink and see her Doctor that recomended the drink for her now she has 2 cans going to waste and out of $51.44 out why do people state that it works when it's a Big Rip Off.Upset in Houston,Texas"
4,Bill,"the product is doing every thing it said it would. you have to want to do it, it will work. I lost 15lbs in 3 wks."
2,did not work,I tried the product twice. The first time I ate fresh fruit and of course nothing happened. The second time I followed with no exceptions and nothing happened. It did not work at all for me. My sister used it at the same time and she lost 10 lbs. in two weeks.
5,Excellent for Christains attempting to understand Muslims,"Outstanding book. Well organized, insightful, concise. A great book for Christians attempting to understand the mindset of Muslims. The book helps to stimulate cooperation and respect between the two religious factions."
5,Pretty doll,"I ordered this doll for christmas for my daughter. She loves dolls with hair and i always loved Bratz so i purchased the doll. The doll is non-existent in stores so i was very happy to find it on Amazon. The only negative was the box was a little banged up, but every thing else is gret; cant wait til she plays with it."
5,Italian Dictionary,I got the large size and the mini and this is the best italian/english dictionary I have seen
1,Too Bright,"The display was so bright that it lit the room. When I turned in my sleep to face the clock radio, the brightness woke me up. I finally put the clock radio under the bed until morning (where it continued to illuminate the legs of all the furniture). Then I boxed it up and returned it.The tuning has a digital indicator, but it is difficult to turn the knob just right to get the station you want."
3,Display could be better,"The clock display does not match the photo above. The dark (background) area is actually lit up (a darker blue than the clock numerals) and it lights up the entire room at night. Audio quality is loud and clear, pretty good for the price."
2,Across the Bitter Sea,I took a trip to Ireland this summer. The tour guide recommended some novels and Irish books to give a flare of Ireland. So that was the reason I ordered several of her recommendations. If that what is wanted then this is a good book to read.
2,Painful,I have many friends whose children have become religious.This mother whined and whined.Give me a break.
3,The Prince,"The book came in terrible packaging, causing the cover and spine to be bent and torn.But, the book was still in great condition.I was hoping it would Arrive earlier."
2,"Very logical, but rather inhumane","When I read this book with a class, we read only the first seven or so chapters as a group, then each of us took one of the remaining chapters and taught its content to the rest of the class. What I read was very interesting and closely reasoned, but it was thought out without any hope in God. ""The Prince"" really makes you think about the problems there are in leadership. I wouldn't recommend reading this book without having someone to talk to about what you read, preferrably an older, wiser person rather than a peer."
3,Hmmm...,"Machiavelli's The Prince is a great illustration of one of the best thinkers of that time. However, for the not-so-avid historical/philosophical reader, it came as a pretty hard pill to swallow. While reading I often found myself, reading and rereading and doing the same process again to fully grasp it. Not a one day read, as could be deceiving by the lack of bulk in the abridged version. For those who enjoy the historical and the idealist lifestyle, take a stab at this true work of brilliance. But don't be surprised if you find yourself sitting down and after an hour's time, only reaching page 15 and still not seeing how people call this guy a genius. You've got to be in the right mindset to read this, so don't prepare for something weak, this one is heavy, so brace yourself with a cup of coffee (maybe with an ample amount of brandy, that you'll most likely adhere to strictly once you hit the particularly granular middle of the text) and enjoy."
2,Over-rated,"What is all the fuss about this book. Machiavelli's overrated book is nothing more than mindless ramble about principalities and how to get them and how to keep them and generally uninteresting stuff. I thought when I bought it I would be shocked as it's reputation would suggest, but I found myself very disappointed at this boring rubbish. Why everyone finds this book shocking I will never know. Its too short to make interesting reading and most of this book is nothing more than a history lesson. Overrated.........."
1,Paying More for Less,"This book is a reprint of the popular George Bull translation of the Prince without any introductory material. Why readers would prefer to shell out $10.00 for this edition when the same translation is available for $7.00 with an introduction by Anthony Grafton and a useful glossary is a mystery. Unless you have a large wallet and especially small pockets (it is a small format paperback), this edition is not for you. The other Penguin edition (0140449159) is highly recommended."
1,You need a long attention span,This book has some good points and is interesting for about five total pages. Personaly i didnt like it a all because its is extremely boring. All it seems to be is a long essay that rambles on and on.
5,excellent study material,This treatise is an excellent example of civic humanism. This idea is essential for understanding the principles and ideas behind Renaissance thought.
4,A great read.,"I'd give this five stars but it is some time since this book was published, and the illustrations/photographs (although extensive) are b&w; and slightly fuzzy by totay's standards. I agree too with the reviewer who said that the photos were sometimes several pages away from the relevant text, but I think that is manageable, and caused by the fact that there are a lot of photos, and sometimes one paragraph of text describes several pages of photos. The text would be a sentence per page if it was more closely linked.The content is superb. I learned a lot and it was all explained clearly.The book is well written by someone who knows how to explain things. I recommend it highly."
2,Not what it used to be!,"Though there is much great technical playing and the band is extremely tight, the soul is lacking. Without Betts the band has virtually no versatility. Trucks plays with no emotion and his solos seem to be an endless screech with little or no taste. Haynes slide playing blows Trucks away. The new songs are not memorabile. Without Dickey the band is just a second rate blues band riding on a name and past reputation. The best song on the tape is Gregs Old Before My Time, it's loaded with soul. Disappointed without Dickey!!!!"
3,Stating the Facts!,"well,just to shine a little truth on the subject,some of you reviewers aren't quite with it!Derek T. did not replace Richard Betts as guitarist,he has been in the band several years now,Warren H. did!And as far as a review of my own,I have'nt seen it yet,but the Allman Bros.won't be the same without master Dickey!!Any Questions?Longbow"
3,ALLMAN BROTHERS LIVE AT THE BEACON THEATER,"The allman Brothers were one of my first concerts back in 1973 or was it 74. We all had a good time and I have tried to keep up with the music over the years. The video and audio productions on this DVD are fine, no problems. The music is fine with nary a missed beat or strained vocal. My problem with this DVD is there is no excitement. No interaction between the band members, or between the band and the audience. When I watch a music DVD or go to a concert I like to think that the band is having as much fun as I am, and not just fullfilling a contract. I loaned this DVD to a friend who summed it up like this. ""I could have put up some cardboard cutouts of the band and played a CD and gotten the same results"". I have to agree with him."
3,"Great Concert, Poor Sound Quality on the DVD","The sound was wonderful when I saw it on cable, and that prompted me to buy it. The DVD soundtrack sounded as if it were in mono."
5,Great Performance (what do you expect from ABB?),"I recently purchased and watched this DVD, and I was absolutely blown away from the very start. Not only is the sound terrific, but the song list is very strong. Although I'm too young to really identify with the Allman Brothers of the 70's, I believe that Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes do their job and do it well. The soul of the band is evident through their performance. Songs such as ""Soul Shine,"" ""Whipping Post,"" and ""Statesboro Blues"" are absolutely out of this world. If you're a fan of rock, blues, jazz, world music, etc. then add this DVD to your collection. You won't be disappointed."
4,How God manifests in everyday life.,"Laura E. Gentry's LIVING WORD gathers portraits of individuals who wear a t-shirt with one word to define him or her self. The insights are both spiritual and psychological, with LIVING WORD an intentionally religious title meant to describe how the word of God manifests in daily life. All ages and colors receive representation and black and white photos paired with descriptive insights of each word's meaning."
1,NOT as shown,"Item is NOT as shown on you on-Line advertisement! There it is shown as a complete tailgate locking system including the handle not as received consisting of only the Bezel, lock and two key! I consider this fraudulent method of advertising and do expect to be credited the full amount of purchase, shipping and the additional cost of the return shipment! returned 12 days ago still waiting refund"
2,Different Speaker from other books in the series (audio book),"Why do speakers change in a series of books? I am not even saying that this one is not as good as Scott (ok, high score to beat), but he is very different and once we are used to Pendergast speaking in a ceratin voice...There is a reason why the same characters play the same role in a series of films."
3,Not Up To Par,"Normally when I read a book by these two authors I can easily polish it off in a few days. This one seemed to take forever. The story starts off fine. A body is found in the attic of a fabulous Long Island estate. There is a claw print scorched into the wall, and the stench of sulphur chokes the air. With a beginning like that, you'd think it would be a great book, but it seemed to drag on forever. I think that Preston and Child were trying to write an epic story, but the excesses of the story turned it into an epic bore. This could have been a more interesting book if it had been shorter and less epic in its sweep. A surfeit of good things bores me, and that is what Preston and Child did in this book. It can't hold a candle to The Cabinet of Curiosities."
4,Excellent Continuing Characters,Choice of 4 stars vs. 5 is based only on use of prime cause less world shaking than prior efforts of these authors. The story is imaginative and artfully developed and the rappearing characters [particularly FBI agent Pendergast] are terrific.
4,excellent,"This is a a long book,about 700 pages,but definately not boring.I borrowed this book from the library and read it in about 4 or 5 days.That to me means this book more than held my interest.I loved it almost as much as Cabinet Of Curiosities.I also enjoyed Still Life With Crows.All novels with the rather strange but charming Pendergast.Mr eccentric is in top form and the book ends with you dying to read their next thriller Dance with Death.Is agent Pendergast really doomed?or does he dodge death again?These guys Douglas and Child write a good book.Fans of Pendergast will not want to miss Brimstone."
4,A good read,"If you're a Preston-Child fan, buy this book, you won't be disappointed. The pace is fast for the most part, although it tends to slow down a bit midway through. The character development is great, D'Agosta is back, and Pendergast is human and vulnerable. So far my favorite has been ""Relic"" (I have yet to read ""Cabinet of Curiosities, however. These authors have not disappointed me yet."
3,I was expecting more.,"This one is a step up from the previous Pendergast entry `Still life with crows'. It brings back old characters from the first Lincoln/Child novel. If you are used to this authors they deliver the usual, an interesting if farfetched mystery plot.There are a couple of negatives, the actual resolution is revealed way before the end of the novel, right before the final confrontation between Good and Evil; this is somehow anticlimactic. Also there is a subplot involving a journalist and a wanna be Messiah that does not go anywhere, chapters involving this plot are inserted in between the main plot chapters to make the cliffhangers longer. This is somehow annoying and makes the book drag a little.Despite all it is entertaining."
4,brimstone,"just finished reading brimstone and it kept me reading til all hours. i just wish men would realize that swear words in good books are a turn off and i inked them out of mine so i could enjoy it more then next time. it was very annoying to have to edit a book as you are reading. all in all i enjoyed their book as ""wow"" just like their first book Relic. this one would make a good horror movie."
3,Certainly not one of their best...,"I found ""Brimstone"" to be a disappointment. The ""fixes"" that Pendergast & D'Agosta get into involve implausible resolutions. And although I hate it when readers are unwilling to suspend belief, there are a few situations that are just ridiculous. Pendergast is given to long narratives as he explains how - once again - he has managed to defeat certain doom. The ""secret"" is revealed way too early (and you can see it coming from a million miles away), and there's a side story about a misguided preacher that doesn't add much to the plot. I would have preferred the opportunity to delve deeper into Pendergast's life, including learning a bit more about his intriguing family - which, apparently, we have the opportunity to do in ""Dance of Death."" I recommend ""Still Life with Crows"" and ""The Cabinet of Curiosities"" as among the authors' best."
2,2.5 Stars - Let Down,"This was my first Preston / Child Book and I had high hopes after reading other reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found it to be slow compared to some of the other books I have read lately. The coolest part of this book - which linked certain past historical events to the present - was given about 10 pages of attention I really wish they developed that further. I found myself wanting to skim a lot of the detail to move the plot along more quickly. This story should have been told in about 300 pages. There were at least 200 pages of fluff (I wasn't very intrigued or interested by the central park plotline).Wait for paperback - if at all."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!!!","This is an incredible game! It is very similar to the Driver series, in that you must complete a series of missions while avoiding the police, and beating the time on the clock. However, there are enough new elements to make this an enjoyable game in it's own right. The graphics are very good, especially the detail of the buggy and the police cars. The maps are simply huge and there is a mode called ""Joyride"" in which you can just cruise around and enjoy the scenery. The game play is challenging to say the least. I am not the kind of gamer that can afford to devote long hours to beating a level, and so I do think that the game can be quite frustrating at times, but like I said, I don't have a whole lot of time to play anyway. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys racing games with a twist."
4,Fowl Play,"This video is a must for Mousse fans! The plot is ""Mousse captures Akane to lead Ranma to him so he can defeat Ranma and become Shampoo's wife...and Shampoo agrees to date Mousse if he beats Ranma, but she gives Mousse a trick weapon so he loses, even after he gives up Shampoo's weapon and starts using his own. However, after Mousse puts up a great fight but loses, Shampoo comes and turns him into a duck and carries him home into the sunset amid sad music! YAY!"" There are quite a few Ranma and Akane scenes here, as well as a SHAMPOO and MOUSSE scene...aww...I am only giving this 4 stars because as Cyberella said, the animation could have been better, but the plot was teriffic! I highly recommend this."
2,A Little Too Self-Indulgent,"This is not my favorite Taylor album...by a long shot. Tzotzil-Mummers-Tzotzil is an extended studio piece with one of Taylor's typical long extended group freak-outs surrounded by some pretty self-indulgent ""poetry""...really more spoken word soundscapes.The music during the group sessions is quite good...good enough for four stars actually. But it isn't indispensible Cecil Taylor. For that I'd get the Blue Note albums of the 60s, or the Cecil Taylor Unit work of the early 80's when Ronald Shannon Jackson was the drummer. And the spoken word soundscapes wear out their welcome quite fast really. The way that the CD is tracked, it is impossible to skip over these sections so I find that, if I'm in the mood for Taylor, I choose other albums to listen to over this one."
5,Great book,"My third son is an archaeologist, and he has introduced me to James Deetz--his favorite archaeologist for whom he named a kitten that he found. The first book by Deetz that I read is ""In Small Things Forgotten."" I loved it, and I learned many interesting facts about how things have changed over the years. So now I'm reading ""The Times of Their Lives"" about the settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts. It's really good to be able to separate fact from fiction. And you get a really graphic idea of how hard life was for the first settlers. (We'd still be in England or wherever if settling this country depended on people like me!) And I found out that there was a connection with John Smith between Jamestown and Plymouth--never heard about it in any history course."
2,Poor fit of one shoe,"During the past 12 years, I have purchased six pair of Seawalker shoes. This is the first pair that have not fit perfectly. They bind across the metatarsal-phalangeal articulation. I am able to wear them only several hours at a time. I am using shoe stretchers with limited success. The first ECCO shoes that I purchased were made in Denmark. Since then they have been made in Portugal, Serbia, China, Serbia. It seemed that the products were identical until now. I have been so pleased with prior Seawalkers, that it is difficult for me to complain about these."
1,Ecco shoes over-rated,"A few years ago I bought a pair of ECCO shoes similar to this one. They had rubber-like soles with an embedded oval containing the word ECCO. I wore them on a two-week trip around the eastern Mediterranean, and when I got home I found that the oval on both shoes had disappeared, leaving a big oval-shaped hole. The local shoe repairman said he could not resole ECCO shoes, so I sent it to the recommended repair depot, which resoled them with Vibram soles. I hardly ever wore them until this year on a two-week trip to Russia. Halfway through the trip, the sole partially separated from the shoe. I repaired it with duct tape to get through the rest of the trip.Given the problems I've had, I don't understand why ECCO shoes are so highly rated; from now on I will buy only Merrell shoes."
3,toy iron,"This is a very realistic-looking iron and my 4 y.o. absolutely loves it. However, the water-spraying feature is a joke. The water compartment holds probably less than half a teaspoonful of water and, by the time I help my daughter figure out how to push the spray button, all of the water is gone. I feel this toy, though realistic looking, is overpriced for just being a plastic toy with a light that turns on."
5,Sending a copy to my Mom!,"Never in my life have I had a desire to read a book about cleaning but a friend assured me this book was different ... AND SHE WAS RIGHT! This book was as entertaining to read, as it was useful. The quick tips help make cleaning a breeze allowing me more time to do what I like to do best ... anything but clean!!! I give this book two-thumbs up. A must for all women who embrace the notion that life is just to short to let one little dust bunny ruin it!!!!"
2,OMG THE SMELL!,first off let me say this the smell is disgusting it smells like chemicals I've done everything I could to get the smell oFf I even sOked it in soap and water overnight.. I have to have this item for a bout 2 months and the TASTE is disgusting IT get stuck in your mouth..the only thing I can say that I'd like about this is the textURE and type in the jelly like substance feeling..
5,"It's just a dildo, what else can I say?","These are issues people have:smell: The smell isn't bad at all. There's a slight plastic smell, but I like it. It's definitely doesn't stink up a room.girth: The girth isn't that big at all. It's alright. It fills you up, but it isn't overwhelming. Might be if you're used to small men.firmness: It's really squishy and bendy, but I think that's fun! It doesn't affect it's effectiveness at all.I'm glad I got it. It's interesting."
1,Cant Get Past The Smell!,"Great size. Fun Toy, but the smell is sooo strong on this toy that it left our bedroom smelling funny. We woke up the next day & the smell was still there... 3 days later you can still smell it- mind you it was sealed in its plastic case in a box in the closet! We sadly threw it out, the smell was that strong. Too bad bacause its a nice product, but the smell overwhelmed us. I even gave it an alcohol bath to see if it would cut the smell ( its a sweet yucky smell). Nothing worked. So, we used it twice and then had to trash it. Sad"
5,It cleared my main line in one use,"All my sinks and tubs drained very slowly so I decided to try this. The instructions states that you should apply 8 oz a day over 4 days. You pour it in the toilet and flush it and leave over night, avoiding using the water. I was ready to do this for 4 days but after the 1st application, all the sinks and toilets drains normally again. I will still apply it for another 3 days but I am so happy with how effective this is. Highly recommended."
3,Midnight Club,"Now, don't get me wrong, this is a fun game. But only for the first day. I have played other racing games which have kept my interest for more than this. As for buying this game for a launch title... get something else."
2,Borrrrrrring!!,"This game is awful. I like racers, but what the heck is this? This game has you racing against people that are either very stupid or super-human, you are not equally matched against anyone! ....P.S. Okay graphics are the only plus!"
2,"So close, yet so far","The game had all the potential of being something great, but it fell short in a big way. The graphics are ok, but not as great as they could of been. The cars have almost no realistic value, and you only get 3 cities to race in. I think that MC2 should be alot better then this waste of money. I would recomend that you rent this game before buying."
3,good,this was my first ps2 game and for some reason i had a hard time getting rid of it. it was very unrealistic but it was very fun. i finally put it up on amazon for sale. it is a good racing game for younger kids
3,Not the best....,"Don't make the same mistake I did - the first PS2 game I bought was Gran Turismo 3, now every game I play seems pretty poor in comparison. Midnight Club is very much an arcade racer, not a simulation in any way, the cars and circuits are almost cartoon-like. It's a good idea for a game, but seems to have been executed very poorly. It soon becomes tiresome, and after a couple of hours of play you'll be putting it back in it's case and reaching for something else. Chasing little dots around a city doesn't hold the fun for too long, and there's little else to do. The cities seem quite accurate, I lived in Central London for several years and could even find my old apartment building! :) Overall, I'd say if you've already played GT3 and Nascar Heat 2, don't buy this game - you'll be sorely disappointed - if this is your first driving game you'll probably have lots of fun with it."
2,I Had A Bad Feelin About This Game,"When I first saw this game i just had a really bad feelin about it. it just didnt seem good, but i let a stupid and fake person talk me into buyin it, he just threw off the whole game for me. He said that you could snatch poeple out of their cars, and candy paint cars, and put gold thangs on the cars. but wut really got me pumped was he said that there were old schools, like cutlases and regals, but he lies again. DONT BUY THIS GAME, PLEASE RENT IT FIRST...."
3,Nice reader,The reader part works great as long as you make sure the card is seated properly. However my Kodak camera will not read the card at all. But still it works great for holding massive amounts of data.
4,Must-have for Digital Camera Owners,"I bought this along with aCanon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver). I've had good experiences with Kingston products, and have been happy with this purchase as well. The reader is a little wide, so you might have trouble finding an properly-sized spot on your computer. Many computers now have SD card readers built-in, but if you have an older computer, or will be loading photos on other computers, this is a very handy product to have around."
1,Unreliable ! (No longer - updated comments),"I originally posted that this card was unreliable ( I had two cards fail ) but have since found that the problem was caused by my new digital camera 'frying' the card. Once the problem occurred with a third, different brand of card, I exchanged the camera and the problem was solved.That means that I can't really recommend or criticise the Kingston, as I haven't really used it properly. For the very short time it did work it was fine - the card reader is a little slow but great value for money.(I'd upgrade the star rating to a more neutral level but this option does not appear to be available)"
3,so so,"The card reader was defective - worked only as ""read only device"".Kingston Elite memory card is very fast - same write speed as the SanDisk Ultra II SD card, read speed is 1.5 times faster.But ... two times the card lost format (and all data) after reading. I am not sure that the card is defective, maybe the problem was in defective card reader.Product was returned to Amazon for refund."
4,More please.,"I actually liked this season better than the first. This type of comedy isn't hilarious. It won't make you laugh out loud. It's not supposed to. This type of comedy simply amuses, distracts and comforts. More please."
5,hilarious,"excellent show. funny and creative. sometimes, it is a bit too quirky, but fun and funny for the most part"
4,A Love Letter to Portland,"Like Season 1, it captures Portland's freaky sensibility. And the freakiness of 21st century urban human beings in general. I love that each segment is labeled with a specific place name - like you could go there and see that. (Except of course you couldn't.) (Or maybe you could.)"
2,Repetitive and judgemental,"Overall, this book was a disappointment. The section that actually gives tips on how to successfully breastfeed is very short, while the rest of the book is filled with anecdotes and repetition. While I understand the desire to promote breastfeeding, this information could have been condensed to 1/3 of the length and would have been much more direct.I am a strong proponent of breastfeeding, but I found that the author's tone was condescending and judgmental towards women who are having difficulty breastfeeding, rather than offering help and suggestions. I was greatly offended by the first third of the book, where all medical professionals are described as incompetent, uncaring, and mean.I would suggest choosing a different book."
5,This Book Really Helped,"If you are hoping to nurse, read this book! Tamaro takes on breastfeeding with a light, witty approach that makes you feel like you're chatting with a girlfriend, not getting advice from an expert. Tamaro is an expert though, a trained LC whose own expereinces in breastfeeding, combined with the stories of hundreds of nursing mothers combine in this satisfying read."
2,Not what it was supposed to be,"I purchased this product and what was delivered did not resemble the photo, so much so that I thought it was packaged wrong from the factory. I returned it and had them send me another one. Unfortunately it was the same. Thank God the returns went without issue. Along with the covers covering over the pocket on the back of the front seats, I feel the ""Premier Tweed Fabric"" description needs to have the word ""Premier"" removed."
1,"One Good Chapter, One Poor Book!","The book is overpriced, and poorly written. There are some well done histories on the 92nd in print, this is not one of them. Half the book is written about three individuals, Fox, Baker, and Almond, the other half contains fragmented historical accounts of the units engaged in the Italian Campaign. As a poor aside he actually list the books in one paragraph that contain a more detailed history, but I ask; What is this book suppose to be about? I thought I was buying a history of a Black Fighting Division, instead I get autobiographical information on three people, only one of which-General Ed Almond I hadn't seen before. And no where in the book do I find any reference to the Divisions performance during the Serchio Valley attacks in December of 1944. As I stated in the title to this review. One good chapter does not a book make. Save your money folks, this book should be retailing for $ in the close out section of your local bookstore soon!"
4,Perfect Choice for Washing an SUV or Truck,"The Detailer's Choice 6375 Chenille Wash Mop is a better for cleaning floors or windows, instead of a vehicle because the head does not spin sufficiently while washing. Rather the mop's neck gets stuck in one direction and users must constantly reposition the head in order to change the angle.The 45"" Telescoping Handle is useful; and the mitt is light, non-abrasive, and sud-worthy. Washing windows with this mop means it would remain at one angle for a flat surface; however, washing a vehicle is too demanding for this product because its head doesn't change angles easily/quickly; it is rather tiresome.A better alternative product to this is a telescopic wash brush, which is stronger, needs no angler motion, and is able to access indentations, such as a vehicle's rims. See:Laitner 15168 10"" Premium Bi-level Wash Brush With Flo Thru Telescopic Handle"
5,Pretty much what you'd expect...,It's an extension cable for your controller. What more can you really say? It's great for when your console is all the way across the room and you don't want to have to worry about the quick-connect pulling loose. I've had no problems with it.
5,Changes the way you look at movies...,"Found this book inspirational and insightful. The reviews made me look at movies I'd already seen in a new light... and made me want to see other films I'd previously dismissed. Definitely worth a read. If nothing else, it may introduce you to some spiritual celluloid gems you'd previously overlooked."
2,not what I expected......,"This is not the type of book I expected at all. The stories, with a couple of exceptions, are self serving and insipid. More about the main characters foibles, it leaves nothing behind with the reader but feelings of depression about what should be a warm and cheery time of year. Personally, this is not the type of book I look for at the holidays. Aimed above the head of the average man or woman, these stories tell of the rich and supposedly famous, who muddle and whine their way through the holidays without a warm and caring thought about others. Mr. Devereaux has missed the mark on what the average person would like to read. I read, and enjoyed, Nevada Bluff. This is a total let down from his normal fare. ""The Hare's Path"" and ""The Gift"" are the only two stories worth reading in the whole collection. It is a shame that these two fine authors could not have published them alone. The two star rating I gave this work is for their stories alone."
2,Overview Of Access,"I was dissapointed with this book. I am new to access and was looking for a book on how to build a Dababase. This book came with a cd with all the projects on it. Each chapter refered to the example project and basically showed you what access does. I found this book is really an overview of what access does. I would have prefered a hands on approach and learned how to build a simple Database from scratch. Instead, the teaching method was looking at a already built Database, do a small exercise on the database and move on to another project, this formula was repeated throughtout the book.Update:After reading several book on Access, the best book that I've found and one that I would highly recommend as an intro book is ""Accessible Access 2003"" by Mark Whitehorn and Bill Marklyn."
2,Looks great but doesn't perform well,"I bought this in October, 2004 because I wanted something small for my kitchen. You cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker. Now, it shuts off mid-way and I have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it. Hopefully the ""powers that be"" will read these comments and make improvements."
5,Great Steamer,This is an excellent rice/vegetable steamer. It is so quick and everything comes out perfect. It was a great buy from amazon.
4,Great for Two,"My wife was so delighted with this item when I gave it to her four years ago. It failed. I just bought another one, although I wish Cuisinart would make a more long lasting product. It cooks the rice perfectly, and we almost always steam some vegetables to go with supper. It works great, but doesn't last forever. I guess you should think of it like a toaster; they just don't last. Having said that, we couldn't be happier with the way it performs."
4,My first rice cooker - not bad,"I have never used a rice cooker before and this one is pretty easy. I think the hardest part is tweeking the rice/water ratio. I did also have boil over problems, but after adding a small amount of butter in the beginning that has seemed to stop.Since I've never used one before I can't say if this one is good or bad. I just use it for two people and it works fine for us. I've used short and long white and long brown rice. I rinse some of my rices too, which the instructions suggest for imported rice. The steaming option is definitely a bonus."
1,More of the same.,"Like many others, steaming rice in one of these contraptions is a waste of time. We thought perhaps we were missing a gasket, given the mess that was on our counter after each use. And reducing the water made the rice come out crunchy. So, we're chalking it up to a bad purchase and returning to our tried and true pyrex casserole dish in the microwave. That always worked just fine."
5,This is A Great Product,I love this rice maker and steamer. Each time I have used this product I enjoy it more and more. Cusinart products have never disappointed me. Great price from amazon as well.
5,Small yet powerful!,The rice cooker is smaller than I had pictured it when I placed the order yet we are satisfied with the results it has given us. It may be a bit slower than my last cooker but still faster and more convenient than stove top cooking and tender moist rice is always the result!
2,Not too happy,"The CRC-400 boils too fast and spits out hot water, so you have to put in more water than you normally would. It is only slightly better in this regard than our old cheapo $15 rice cooker."
1,Terrible Disappointment and Dangerous,Pretty to look at but an awfdul design. It boils over every time; does not cook the rice properly and makes a mess that is annoying to clean up. I have used rice cookers for 25 years; this is the worst appliance I have ever owned.
3,heads up,I just got this rice cooker out of the box. I haven't used it yet. I just wanted to let everyone know that the cord does not retract for easy storage as mentioned in the description. It was one of the selling points that got me to buy it but it turned out to be false.
1,JUNK!,"The first thing that happened after only a few uses, is I dropped the lid... by some miracle the glass didn't shatter, but, it may as well have since the handle broke apart and was unfixable. I went to the hardware store and make-shifted a handle so that I could continue to use it. After maybe another 10 times of use the ""push down"" button to start it began to pop away from the frame of the body. I continued to push it back in, wires and all, for about another 10 uses or so, before having to break down and throw it away. Don't waste your money or the resources."
2,"Good rice , but always makes a mess","I bought this one based on the Cuisinart name. After about a dozen uses, it's going in the garbage. A rice cooker should not spew starchy bubbles all over the countertop when filled to only half of it's capacity. Watching how vigorously this boils, my guess is that the heating element is oversized for the bowl. I use a rice cooker to reduce the amount of work, not increase it."
5,This rice cooker is awesome.,"I purchased this for my daughter because she has a stainless steel Cuisinart coffee pot and I thought it would look nice. It not only looks beautiful, it works great. She made brown rice in it and it came out perfect. Many of her friends have commented on how unique it is because of the square shape and stainless steel finish. This rice cooker was a bargain."
1,I really disliked this rice cooker,"I gave alot of thought to buying this cooker after my old trusty Black and Decker cooker died after 15+ years. It makes a mess, spitting out water. If I reduced the water, it came out dry ( I live a t altidute). When steaming one day, the water ran out, and the heating element melted giving off a awful smell. At least it is dead now, and I can try again with a different brand"
3,Nice looking rice cooker.,"Ok, I love cuisinart for kitchen appliances, but this cooker does not do as well as some more inexpensive models. I think the problem is that this cooker is more powerful than most. You have to add more water than the instructions recommend or you will burn the rice. Add a little more water and voila! It's pretty good, and you are hard pressed to find another rice cooker that looks this good.Recommended!"
1,Big Disappointment,"Worked great the first day, quit early the second day, and now refuses to turn on. Tried it in multiple outlets, still doesn't work... wish my hubby wasn't so quick to toss the box and receipt. Won't be buying this brand any time soon."
1,Boils over EVERY time,Received this for Christmas. We have never owned a rice cooker and were excited to use it. Followed the directions EXACTLY- boiled over. Tried rinsing the rice- boiled over. Less water than recommended- boiled over. Different brand of rice- boiled over. Tried a little oil- boiled over. Tried cooking less rice- boiled over. Done trying. Hopefully whoever picks it up at Goodwill will have better luck. IMHO- terrible product.
1,Poor Design,"This is one of the worst designed products I have ever used. It is impossible to make rice without it making a huge mess on the countertop. Then, it is very difficult to clean the outside of the thing. I should have kept the cheap one that I replaced; it was far superior."
3,It's okay. Really.,"Undoing Ruin is a good CD. The disc is indeed worth a listen, but there are inconsistencies that need addressing. First of all, the vocals are terrible. The ""growls"" are not growls, but more of a distorted sigh, almost comparable to the sound you'd get if you punched someone that could really scream in the gut . The drummer is decent, but that's about it. He is NOT a technical player and blends into the background noise with his ho-hum percussion. The bass player is also decent, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the guitars. They seem to achieve the balance of technical and emotional playing. Think of Necrophagist. Stellarly technical band, but they lack emotion in a lot their playing. Necrophagist is a completely different (sub)genre, yes, but the point remains. As I said before, it's worth a listen, but do I consider this a buy? I seriously think you should listen to them BEFORE you spend money on them."
5,WOW! METAL IS HERE AND DARKEST HOUR PROVES!,This is one of the best metalcore bands. This CD rocks and Darkest Hour shows to be a perfect example of a punk/metal combination. I am a hardcore punk fan and this is actually probably concidered hardcore punk combined with heavy metal. There are a ton of metalcore bands out there and this is one.
3,I know Bruce can do better.,"I'll be brief. The music, creative guitar work, and vocal performance is very good. If that's all you care about, then you'll be very pleased with this album.However, if you like the introspective and political lyrics that Bruce had in earlier albums, especially Balls to Picasso, you'll be disappointed with this one. Most of the lyrics deal with the fantasy world, which I think works better with Iron Maiden.Bruce has a lot more to offer lyrically. I enjoy hearing his views on the injustices of the world, personal struggles, and any topic based in reality. His music and voice fit so well with lyrics that have substance. Go back and listen to Cyclops and you'll understand."
2,"No atmosphere, no chemistry....","There is a HUGE diference between ACCIDENT OF BIRTH and The CHEMICAL WEDDING. Although TYRNANNY OF SOULDS is very good, there is a very strange atmosphere in there that is the absolute portrait of the truth about the amking of this album: the fact that none of the musicians involved ever recorded / rehearsed int the same room together!! This sia n album made entirely on PC-Tools (Bruce himself admitted it), in reunions between Roz Z and Bruce. I think Bruce never ever met bass player and drummer. The result of this is a ""cold"" album, without atmosphere, it's a weird experience listening to it."
1,Not good Celtic music,"I was disappointed with this album. After hearing this, I refuse to ever listen to this band again. It's not true Celtic music...It's elevator music with some bagpipes in the background and some Gaelic lyrics. I'm more into traditional Celtic music rather than adult ""light"" music that reminds of me Michael Bolton (yech). If you want some good Celtic music, check out Gaelic Storm's self titled CD. They're awesome."
5,Happy with the choice !,"I did some research before buying this Samsung 26"" LCD HDTV, and couldn't be happier with my choice !, it's worth the price....., I've just tried two sources (HD DVD and PC) and both work great so far!, I read some reviews about a pitch noise coming from the upper side of the TV, and was afraid about it, but everything has worked out fine ....Great picture, great looks... sound could be improved a little but for a small room it works fine. Just one thing... make sure about the size you are interested in, This HD technology it's so impressive that you can easily feel short with a 26"" !!, In my case, after enjoying it for less than a week, I'm planning to ""upgrade"" to the Samsung LNT4065F 40"" 1080p !!!,... As always, Amazon was a pleasure to buy from, and people from Electronics Expo did also a great job !"
5,Dragonfever,Since I already seen dragonball on t.v. first I just wanted to say that the uncut version is way better then the edited version. Dragon ball is so funny it will have you laughing from beginning to end. It's about a boy named goku and the red ribbon army is trying to get the draonballs from him so he goes on an all out war with them to stop them from their evil plans. I say this is a must have for any dragonball fan out there who is making a collection or is just wanting to see how it all begins.
2,No heat!,"I agree with Lawrence Lynn. I wore this vest outside, under a winter coat, and could barely feel any heat. These vests are heated by electrical resistance. This always uses a lot of power (think electric stove) and the two, tiny 3.7 V batteries that come with the vest are just not enough. The vendor is letting me return the vest (which I will)."
4,Great book of faith!,I bought this book because I wanted to give it out as a Christmas gift to my Sunday school class. They loved it so much they keep asking when we can have a class to just discuss George Muller and his incredible trust in the power of prayer.It was incredibly encouraging to read about George Muller. If you are looking for a comprehensive biograpy this is not the book for you. It does have an overview of his life but has his writings sprinked into it. I thought it has a nice balance. This is an easy to read book that will inspire your faith and prayer life. It did mine.
2,Close but no cigar,This was one of my most disappointing Amazon buys ever. I ordered two spools of 100ft ea. First off the bungee was affixed to the reels with straight pins.That would have been ok if there had not been breaks in the bungee half way through each roll. On one roll the break was after 45 ft. and I got cut on the straight pin hidden inside the roll. The fact that both rolls had breaks in different places meant that it was impossible for me to get even amounts when cut to length. On top of that there were several bad spots in each piece of individual the bungee pieces. Bad spots that had to be cut out. Causing even less of the total amount to be usable. BEWARE if you buy from this vendor!
3,"Good Life, Crappy design","This is really a must have for a hp/compaq laptop. The battery is good it nearly doubbled my laptops life. I do have one qualm though, the battery elevates the laptop's back and sits off to one side making the laptop tippy towards the top left corner (bad design on this one compaq) this is the only 12 cell out there for my laptop, so I just have to deal with it."
2,Just Not Good. Thought it would be better,"Besides Ernest i thought the acting was second rate. The Story sounded interesting enough for me to buy the product, but in the end i found it hard to watch to completion. NOTE: i am not , don't claim to be and never want to be a movie critic. so don't waste your time telling me how bad my review was, Because Frankly, I Don't Give a damn. Thank you."
4,General Tools Wireless Thermo-Hygrometer with Remote Sensor,"Very Nice product. Seems to be very accurate both temp and humidity. I did do the salt test on it and it was off by 1% which is awesome. Has large numbers which makes it easier to see. No back-light, wished it had it. Sensor is nice and I have no trouble putting it outside, upstairs, or in my crawl space to check the humidity. It picks up the signal good.The reason I gave it 4 stars is, no back-light and the price is a bit high, other than that, I am satisfied with it."
4,"Works well, but specifications not complete","The unit seems to work well as utilized to monitor the humidity of a crawl space. There are, however, some typical issues with regard to specifications. The specifications would ideally provide both accuracy and reading tolerance for both temperature and humidity. However, only ""resolution"" is presented. I would interpret one percent resolution as indicationg only that the reading changes in one percent steps, and the accuracy of the absolute value of the reading is not specified."
3,A medium-sized book where a single chapter would do.,"Who wanted this book? This is such a light-weight book -- mostly in-character stuff that fails to give much of an overview of how Awakenings and apprenticeship works for more than the specific examples given -- that I have to wonder if this was taken from some longer work for space reasons and then expanded to justify it being published on its own.The book is 90 percent in-character talk about apprenticing and lots of obvious points (didja know it's hard to balance the demands of apprenticeship and the previous, mundane life? It's TRUE!) with 10 percent useful new information.Having said that, this is done perfectly servicably, but this should be picked up only if you've already grabbed all the really good Mage books."
3,Needs more closed compartments,Only one zippered compartment in the middle. The two pouches for drinks have open bottoms so you can't use them for holding anything else.
1,Defective filter destroyed my faucet,The plastic plug installed to keep the charcoal inside the filter came loose and the charcoal came out and plugged the valve body in my sink faucet and ruined it.
4,not as good as their first book,"I probably would have liked this book much more if I didn't already own ""Rachel Fister's Blister"", which is excellent. ""Cousin Ruth's Tooth"" is cute and zippy, with cats which my 1 year old daughter likes, and funny details which adults will appreciate. But if you can only buy one book by these authors, get ""Rachel Fister's Blister"" instead - it is fabulous."
4,Great at soothing our fussy baby,"We did a lot of research before purchasing this item - the positive reviews on Amazon were what finally swayed us. I am glad that we listened to everyone as this has turned out, at times, to be a life saver. Our twins have each spent some time rocking away. They are just now (at 7 weeks) beginning to notice the lights and mobile, but all along they have really enjoyed the music. I especially liked that you can rotate the swinging motion from side-to-side to front-to-back. We tried the girls in both before settling on the one that worked best."
4,LOVE THIS CUTE SWING,"THIS IS THE SWEETEST BABY GIRL SWING OUT THERE! THE LIGHTS ARE SO CUTE. THE ONLY REASON I GIVE IT 4 STARS IS THAT IT SEEMS LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE THEIR MOTORS BURN OUT. MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T USE IT TOO OFTEN, SO MINE SEEMS PERFECT SO FAR!"
4,Good but not strong enough,"I like the swing, but it doesn't seem to be strong enough, my mom purchased the little lamb swing at a garage sale and it swings faster, not sure why, both are made by fisher price. Other than that my son loves the nature sounds and the lights and mobile."
2,Cheaper to hire a baby sitte,"considering that baby spends 10 minutes a day in this thing, it is cheaper to find a baby sitter... 10 minutes a day makes it 12 hours of babysitting for the price of this cradle"
3,amazons return policy is the best!,"I purchased this to replace same model, its motor was getting very loud! my 3 month old daughter loves it. we get the new one, i put it together. behold the new one won't rock. i don't know what's up with fisherprice, experiences like this make me appreciate amazon even more, their return policy is awesome. we returned it and decided to stick with our old one that just has a very loud motor."
4,Can't live without,Great product. Times when baby is crying and we have tried everything ....this helps soothe relax and I suspect help gasWorth the money
3,So cute,"I love this swing for how cute it is, and all of it's features. My baby loves watching the lights and listening to the music as she swings, but my downside is it doesn't swing very good. With six speeds you'd think it would swing really good at top speed, but I keep it at top speed and it's the same as a very low setting on another swing I have. I had an old fisher price swing that swings both ways just like this one and only runs on batteries. I bought the butterfly one for my house and brought the old one to my mom's, and sad to say the old one just swings better."
2,Loud Swing,"I set up the swing, turned it on, and then came the loud motor. I cant believe fisher-price makes somehitng this noisy. Too loud for new born and to be honest, me."
2,snugabunny swings better,"I compared this swing to the fisher price snugabunny swing and I prefer the snugabunny. This papasan cradle swing is slightly smaller and the motor must be weaker because it barely swings my 11 lb baby at all. Both swings have about the same amount of motor noise, it doesn't bother the baby and when I'm watching tv I don't notice the noise. I definitely appreciate that both swings come with an ac adapter, much cheaper than replacing batteries."
2,My son hated it,"We purchased this swing since it got such wonderful reviews from so many people. It is an adorable swing with everything a child could wish for. Except mine. He hated being in it. He is six weeks old and loves his bouncer but could not stand being in this swing for more than a couple minutes at a time. The motor is a little loud and he would startle when it was started up. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why he didn't like it, except to say that it does provide a lot of stimulation, so be careful if your child is easily overwhelmed. This review isn't here to bash the swing, just to say that some kids like it very simple and don't require all the gadgets and gizmos. He loves his plain old bouncer. We subsequently purchased a FP open top take-along swing which we've had better success."
3,I WANTED baby to love it....,"I really thought she would love it and I anxiously awaited it arrival. Unfortunately, she just isn't into it - we call it the ""Swing of Perpetual Tears"" as she starts crying whenever we put her in it. Now since she turned about 6 weeks, she will sit in for about 10 mins before she starts to cry so we are hoping that maybe she will grow into it a little more as its so cute. And I LOVE that it runs on electric and not just batteries - that is the main reason that I bought this particular swing"
2,too slow!!!,"I bought this swing after the one I had saved from my 4 1/2 yr old the FP ocean aquarium broke the music started going really slow. I recd this and on the fastest speed was really slow, I called FP they sent me a new motor still goes super slow so it must just be the way it is. My daughter will not sit in without crying and she will only sleep in it if she is alseep before I put her in it.I love the fact that it can plug in and that the music does not shut off and its realy pretty but I am not happy with it and I now dont know what to do. I still have the ocean swing and they are now set up side by side in my living room. I keep hoping she will adjust to the slower speed but its been 3 weeks and its not happening!So if you dont mind a slow swing this is the one for you!!"
4,Good Product,I really like this swing other then a constant clicking noise it makes. It doesn't seem to bother my baby but I just wish it didn't do that. Other then that it works great and I love the light and music sound it makes.
3,Not Happy Jan !,"in the photo the swing looks blue, its actually a light purple colour sorta lilac. also the sounds arent very clear and the lulabies are very simerliar. not that impressed all in all. i was very excited when i saw the swing but when it was delivered it wasent what i thought it would be. but it does the job, bub seems to like it."
3,"Sturdy and Reliable, but too fast","I am a first time father of a girl, the swing is great it is doing a good job, my only complaint is that even the lowest setting is a bit too fast, my baby is already 10 pounds so it's not her weight...I would suggest some lower speed settings, I can't see how the highest setting is even safe for a child... maybe i'm just being over-protective?"
1,not as pictured,"The product pictures look like this item is solid colors....it's not. The ""cream"" area is actually a puke-pale yellow star pattern and the ""purple"" area is actually a purple plaid pattern. IT'S F-UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND the motor makes a horribly loud clicking noise. Even with the music volume turned all the way up, you still hear the horrible noises the motor makes."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS SWING!,"We bought this swing for my now 8 week old. She loves it. Loves it. The motor just died - I reached out to Fisher Price and they are willing to sending us a new swing - in 6 weeks!!! 1) A baby swing should last more than 8 weeks. 2)What am I supposed to do for the next 6 weeks? 3) She probably won't even want it at that point! Especially if she has been without it. When I looked this swing up on the Fisher Price site, I noticed there are A LOT of people with similar experiences. Buy something else. I wish I had (and I may still have to)."
1,terrible,"it makes noise after very little use, cracking and does not swing very fast ... for the money it is a waste, I had the previous models and they were cheeper and better..."
1,would give negative stars if I would be able to,we bought this swing thinking that it would be a great for our daughter as a matter of fact it was great for about a week until my daughter weighed around 8 pounds and it was too much for the swing and it just Creeked and squeaked! All I can say is very dissapointed in fisher price I guess they are just not as good as their name used to stand for
1,Good for a month,"I love, love, love this swing, as does my daughter, for the month that it works. First swing stopped swinging after 25 days, loud motor from the start. The second swing lasted 29 days, but had a very quiet motor until the last couple of days. We did use the swing more than average because my baby has such bad colic, but never expected it stop working after just a month. Amazon has been great with returning and getting us a new swing, but for the few days that we are without sure makes things difficult around here."
4,My baby loves it,"This swing is super cute! It swings in 3 different directions, has lights, music and a mobile. It has a buckle so you can buckle your baby in and a support pillow. Although the pillow was a little big for my newborn I still had to add my Kiddopotamus head and body support pillow. She loves sleeping in the swing more than her bassinet or crib. My only complaint is the motor makes a frog like sound when it moves, and after about 7 weeks now it's started to squeak a little bit."
3,Limited Review_more later,"Since the swing was a baby shower gift for our daughter, and the baby has not yet arrived, our review is a bit limited & we will give a more informed opinion later.But so far, the swing itself is enchanting to look at. We tried out the features & it seems really cool. Our daughter loved it, in spite of being sick to death of ""pink gear & clothes""In spite of the reviews I read about the motor problems, the thing that impressed me & seemed to be a common thread, was that Fisher-Price stood behind their product & sent replacement motors.The acid test will be when the baby arrives (any day now) We will let you know...."
5,Love this swing!!,"We have used this swing since birth for our daughter and love it so much. She liked the cradle position when she was newborn and now at 3 mos. she has moved to the other position. When we turn on the music and butterflies she falls right to sleep. She also loves talking to the butterflies. This was very easy to put together and is easy to operate. The plug in feature alone is a selling point. I have had to wash the cushion several times and it is still as good as the day we bought it.We have never had a problem with the motor or with noises from the swing like other people have had. Our daughter loves this swing and so do we. The only complaint is that it is so comfy, that our daughter will sleep all day if we don't take her out of it!! This is a great swing for your little princess!!"
1,piece of crap,Just arrived on Dec 07th 2011 :1.very noisy!!!!... the motor is very noisy sound.2. the music wont work if swing operated.3. keep 'clicker' soundDONT BUY THIS PRODUCT
4,Life saver,I got this swing 1.5 years ago. My son likes to sleep on it even now.Pros:This was the only model which can be connected directly to power outlet among the other fisher price modelsHe like to watching the star light during night and tries to catch the teddy bear that revolves around in the mobile.Has good music which makes baby sleep easily.Cons:The swing is bit noisy and the second position on the swing is not useful at all. It is not possible to put the kid in that position.Overall we were happy with the swing
3,It's Nice however a little pricey,It is nice and well made. The swing motor is a little loud and sometimes will not swing the baby.
4,A pretty good buy,"We got this swing for out last daughter and she seems to really enjoy it.Pros:*It doesn't need batteries! We LOVE this feature! I got so tired of constantly having to purchase batteries with other swings.*It is beautiful!! The butterflies that rotate and the lights that go around are just wonderful!Cons:*The swing is a bit noisy. We called FP and they said to move the legs farther apart (we'd already did that, it didn't help).*The speed you set it on doesn't seem to matter. There are pretty much two speeds... Not much, and not much more. FP said it might be because of weight, but I don't know how that could be... My daughter is only 8-9 lbs at the most."
3,An okay swing...,"The swing is very pretty. Although, the motor seems to have slowed in the 2 1/2 months that I've had the swing. It does not seem to swing as far (it did not swing very far to fast in the first place). I like how you can adjust the back to lay down for when my little one is asleep, but the upright position does not seem enough upright. My daughter gets frustrated and tries to sit up more to reach her toys. I also don't like how the music button and the light/butterfly rotate button are different. One you push to the end to turn off, the other you push to the middle. I always push both to the end, and the lights are left on. I wish the buttons were made the same."
5,Best Ever!,"I searched all over to find the best baby swing that had all the bells & whistles! This one has the quietest motor (extra important), it rocks side to side and front to back, has lights and sound with volume, and most important...it runs on 110v power from the wall or batteries. The basket tilts up or can lay flat. Cushions are nice too. It really is the best swing we've ever found. Two small negatives...it only come in a blue/purple color design and doesn't vibrate...but that's not too important. It's a 5 star definite!"
1,Too much noise,"Just bought and got the swing delivered yesterday. The motor is too noisy, clunk, click, clunk, click. I couldn't stand it and I saw others said the motor is supposed to be quiet, I will return this one or exchange for another quiet one."
3,Love the swing HATE the motor!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was given this swing as a gift and I have to say that I LOVE it and so does our daughter BUT and there is a HUGE but there!!! 3 weeks after having it and using it very lightly ( she was only 2 weeks old when she first went in the swing! ) the motor broke. I was so upset. Fisher Price had me send then the entire seat into them and they would send me a whole new swing because the motors were on backorder. Well, I had to wait almost 3 weeks for a whole new swing. So I got the new one put together and guess what?!?!? 2 DAYS later the motor goes out AGAIN! WHAT IS UP WITH THIS?!?!? I mean this swing is expensive. I love the swing when it works but come on Fisher Price, get your act together here! I just got my replacement motor today and hopefully this one will work longer than 3 weeks. The swing itself when it is working is great. We love the music and my daughter LOVES to watch the butterflies."
5,SO GIRLY!!!,I have 3 boys and we found out we are having a girl.So I had to order this.First it is so adorable i put it together as soon as I got it!Very easy to put together might I add.I had a friend bring her baby over to try it out and that is where she stayed all night!She loved to look up at the lights and We all liked that this swing does not make much noise and love that you can plug it in.Also the music is very nice.It plays different songs without you having to getup and press a button.Very soothing :)I love this swing and know my daughter will too!!!!
5,Great Product!!!,"This swing was purchased for our grandson and it is used daily. He loves it and absolutely loves the lights and sounds.I like this one a lot because not only does it have alot of features, but it also comes with an adaptor so we dont have to use batteries if we dont want to. Just plug it in.It was very easy to assemble, I did it myself in about ten minutes. Simple.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a swing, best one I was able to find."
5,"Harrowing, transcendent drama","I just returned from a weekend in NYC where I saw this play, which won the Pulitzer Prize last week. It is, at the risk of sound hyperbolic, one of the most gripping, exciting, passionate, moving, and intellectually daunting evenings of theatre I have ever seen. I bought the book and reread it on the way home. While nothing can duplicate Kathleen Chalfant's brilliant performance as Vivian Bearing, it is a play that also lives extraordinarily well on the page. Read it--your understanding of life, death, poetry, medicine, the body, and the soul will never be the same."
3,Raw food for thought,"I am not familiar with the works of John Donne. I think I could have enjoyed this play so much more if I were. This play is a heart-wrenching witnessing of the final months in the life of a woman suffering from ovarian cancer. A rather quick read, both by flow and sheer amount of pages, Wit nonetheless says everything it has to say in unequivocal terms, and it is in that where I found some fault. Dr. Jason is very one-dimensional: for him, patients are the mere vehicles where cancer resides, and cancer is the ultimate enemy. He sees his research as a fight, a battle of the wits, between cancerous cells and intelligent brains such as his. Villains (and heroes) are rarely so simplistic. The beauty of evil is that it is so often (and paradoxically) intermingled with confusion and self-doubt, the same way goodness is. In that sense, Vivian was better portrayed. She was no saint, yet her epiphany is almost holy (as it should very well be)."
4,boys playing,"OK, I discovered this one at age 25 and I still like it. ""Boys night out"" was never so wonderous. The story personifies a child's awe of snowy nights."
5,"Marvellous, touch everyone's heart !","The greatest children book I ever read, drawing is beautiful and the story is so touching. It touches every one's deep deep heart and wish can fly with the Snowman in the sky. Highly recommend as a gift at Christmas time for children and even adult.Don't miss it. Just like no one miss 'The Little Prince'."
4,Funny and Insightful,"Having never heard of Craig Chester, I was unsure about what to expect. I picked it up in the store, read a few pages and I was hooked! The Chester family is full of characters we all know from our own families....only funnier! It's great to see someone overcome all that Craig Chester has and come out the other side laughing and making us laugh."
4,Excellent book,This is a excellent book with lot of examples. I will recommend to everyone. Nice to have in your collection.
5,I Love It When An Author Has The Skill To Transport Me Into Their Scenes!,"Brides Of The Empire is one of the few books which really made me feel that I was in that era.Three romances set in ancient Rome is very original,and I found the stories and the history fascinating.Can't wait to read the second book set in in that era~ 'The Chalice Of Israel'."
4,Good but read SB 1 or God by Maddox,"This is a very good argument, uses the authors biased approach of Spartan Meritocracy, a bit weak. The other reviewers have explained this part. This one sided approach leaves the bullet in the hands of the creationist due to many openings of being one dimensional. The creationist has an argument for every theory here. The best book that I have ever read in a very entertaining piece written for all age groups and peoples is SB 1 or God. That book uses real techniques such as the FBI's fingerprint writing style to dissasemble liars. Moses gets turned upside down and wrung out with invention. Much more from a must read. Author is Karl Mark Maddox."
2,The Ebony Cookbook,"Was kind of disappointed when I received this cookbook, first there was no photo's of what the food is suppose to look like, sometimes it's good to see what the food is suppose to look like when it is prepared, gave it to he library.(Kelis's Grandma)"
1,jWin CD player/radio,"This unit worked for about 30 minutes!The radio will receive fm and am stations quite well but after the first tun, the unit will no longer play any of the CD disks that I have, so this product was not built properly.This is the fualt of the production company and not Amazon."
5,One of the best and most thourough biographies ever written,"Written in 1976 when many of Hitler's key contemporaries and friends were still alive, Toland carefully and thouroughly utilizes first person oral histories and a vast myriad of sources to craft one of the most compelling biographies ever written. Toland works effortlessly through his prose to paint a human face on the individual who left perhaps the greatest imprint on the 20th Century. Hitler not only perfectly defined and personified Evil in both the modern and contemporary mind, but also changed the way politics are conducted. His use of multimedia propaganda lives with us still The brilliance of Toland's writing is that while he remains completely objective and true to his subject, he lets history and the facts speak for themselves.For anyone interested in studying the second world war or the 20th century, I truly reccomend beginning with this book. Five stars out of five."
2,REVIEW OF JOHN TOLAND'S ADOLPH HITLER BY JOHN CHUCKMAN,"This book is almost unreadable. It is an indigestible mass of observations and facts by a writer with little talent for narrative.When Mr. Toland finally gets you out of Hitler's tramp/men's hostel/amateur painter days in Vienna, you will almost be grateful to him for ceasing his abuse of readers.We get a far more incisive, cohesive picture of Hitler from Joachim Fest or Alan Bullock.I only fail to give this book the lowest rating because it does represent a huge storehouse of information. Read it if you enjoy rumaging through shelf-loads of stored documents."
2,Disappointing lack of variety,"Being a paper airplane nut since my Dad showed me how to fold my first one, I was ecstatic when I first saw this calendar. I grabbed it and purchased it, ignoring even my normal cursory product research (i.e., I didn't read the label). Turns out that, while there are 365 pages to this calendar, there are only 6 different airplane designs.So more accurately, you get 6 airplane designs, repeated 60 times each throughout the year. All of the 60 repeats have a different paint job, but it's still the same aircraft design, same folds. Instead of lasting me a year, it will only last me about a month until I'm tired of those particular airplanes. Sigh. I will read more carefully next time, depite overwhelming enthusiasm."
4,What every student should read.,"This is a book that every American, and perhaps world, student should read to see that America was the place where innovation happened because the people were free from the oppression of a stupid, politically correct and driven government. That day is gone and we must bring it back.Man is insignificant in the universe and on this planet in terms of doing it any harm. CO2 is a trace gas in air and insignificant by definition, but we are about to destroy our economy over it thanks to the efforts of misguided men chasing ever larger grants to pay for ever more expensive degrees learning more and more about less and less approaching the point of learning everything about nothing, but filling out grant forms and misappropriating public money.This book is about a better, simpler, less intruded on time and may serve as something of a guide for getting back to those values and days."
5,This book should be in everyone's home,"This book is large (9 x 11, 496 pages) and heavy. I can barely lift it with one hand. There are 500 illustrations, many in color, almost one on every page. The accomplishments of 70 innovators are included, such as Morse, Singer, Eastman, Ford, Noyce, Land, Watson, etc. Since I work with computers, I was interested that my former boss, Gary Kildall, is listed as the true founder of the personal computer revolution. His surprising story took 16 pages, IBM and Watson got 19 pages, Edison, 21 pages. This book would make a great Christmas gift. A PBS series follows in November."
3,Very silly,"I thik it was a silly book. Not really very interesting, for my tastes. Not as funny as I expected."
5,Independent seat,great additional info to the first Centered Riding book - exercises make sense and really add to my understanding.
1,Amateur video style and doesn't work,"I bought this DVD to shake up my workout since I am going to Costa Rica and wanted to look good in a bathing suit. Not only does the DVD not give you a good workout but it DOES have a creepy, porn flick kind of ambiance. Strange. A better buy (also on Amazon) is Killer Butt with Dolores Munoz - it will make you sore (and lift your behind at the same time). It worked after I did it for about 6 weeks every other day. It's a little hard on the knees, by the way, so I've had to modify it, but she will work you hard."
4,If you like yoga...,"This is for you. I'm unfamiliar with Beth Shaw's other creations but I felt that this was a decent dvd. If you can handle the soft tone of her voice and that at times creepy almost porn flick feel, then get this. I learned new moves that i can probably do alone, sans Beth so it was worth the price for sure."
1,P****d off I wasted $300!,"There isn't much more I can say that hasn't already been stress.Other than SELF CLEANING HEPA FILTER, yeah and the Titanic was unsinkable too! I wouldn't even give it the honor of 1 star if the review didn't make me."
5,the end of the line,"well sad to say that this is probably the last relase we'llsee from Jan Bicker and Sunny Schram of aBSCESS despite talkof an unfinished/unreleased album....however this record has themshowing great potential in becoming a household name within undergroundEBM/Industrial music. January's vocals are delivered with more power andmite than ever before. Not to mention the hard hitting beats, the profoundkeyboards and synths composed by Sunny Schram (aka) TYPE. highlights :""Marvelous Dreams"" ""Calm Down"" ""Dying Culture"" enjoy"
3,Helpful information. Not really new but great reminders,"While this information wasn't especially new, it was a great reminder. I run decluttering and time management workshops for a living (inspiredhoney.com) and so I like to have a break once in a while give my mind a tune-up (like I do for my car). I always find Brian Tracey's material interesting and well-presented."
2,too much bull about everything but the subject,"I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are looking for a sleeping aid. The few parts that are about John Lee Hooker are good, but there is just too much bull that has little to do with the subject. Too wordy and too hard a read."
3,John didnt like it,"Murray did a lot of research, which is commendable-he tackeled a lot-but the truth was that John was not happy with it...he said that he did not authorize it-his manager did- and that there were a bunch a lies in it-to sell the book..."
2,disappointing,"I share the thoughts of a couple other reviewers here. Namely that the book is longer than it could have been. Had the book been entertaining from beginning to end that would be a good thing. Unfortunately, to my mind, large portions fall close to boring & irrelevance and I found myself skipping over pages at a time - something that should never happen with a good read, especially with such an entertaining subject as John Lee.There is a good amount of research here but I would recommend the book to only the most die hard fans."
2,Misleading,"I found this DVD disappointing. Listed as 60 minutes, it is actually barely 45 minutes in length, with very odd 'breaks' as if for insertion of commercials when used by a PBS. Also the reference to the ""Great Barrier Reef"" is totally erroneous. I ignored the misnomer on the promo text and label packaging as marketing ignorance, but was appalled by that verbal misuse, not once but three times, by a primary documentary host. The Belize Barrier Reef is just that. As an educator, I am unable to use this DVD for that reason. Depictions of the island residents, their lifestyles, and accomodations are realistic. The segment on punta dancing is good but minimal, not quite enough for me to overlook the other discrepancies."
2,Doesn't block enough glare. Darkens screen too much.,"This did NOT sufficiently block glare. Granted, I had a lot of glare to block, but 99% glare block I do not believe."
2,Lots of material. Too fast for beginners and intermediates.,"For high-intermediate and advanced players with a good grasp of tennis termonology, this video would serve as a good refresher. However, for beginners and mid-intermediate players there is too much talk and too much information too fast. Cliff Drysdale, Fred Stolle, and Tracy Austin, talk like engines rushing to a fire.The concepts are sound but the producer tries to cover too much and fails to find points of emphasis."
5,NEW BATTERY,We got this battery because we like to carry the laptop outside and can't do that plugged to the wall. The battery came and I put it in with no problems. It works great. We are now happy with the old laptop! We can move with it again! I recommend it to all.
3,works great,So far it is working like advertised. It was a great price and was shipped and recieved in a timely manner.
2,Did not fix or change our problem,"This was a waste of money for me, but I didn't expect it to work. My transmission will not shift out of first gear until it is totally warm. Once warm, it works fine. This product did nothing for this problem."
4,Classic Pop/Experimental Adventure Leaves You Wanting More..,".if it wasnt so short it might get 4 stars. My second purchase of what is now a 50 cd collection of GBV and GBV related projects. Break Even and Shocker In are classics. I saw them last year and they still play Shocker. The others are the one-off, experimental diamond in the rough GBV that the recently initiated might not be familiar with but should be. Hey dont get uppity with those that caught on late, it takes a special breed to catch on at all."
2,size matters,It is a Privacy Filter but it is rectangular in shape and the wrong size for my monitor. It doesn't look like the photo (it doesn't have little hangers on the top corners) It has velcro stickies to hold the filter to the front of the monitor. I can't use this.... disappointed.
3,"Good product , but one was broken when arrived","I ordered 4 types of wine glasses, 24 glasses in total, from this company. I like all of them but one of the Champagne Flutes arrived broken. Other than the one broken glass seems like good quality would have rated them higher if all arrived in one piece."
2,tall and tippy,These glasses do hold champagne. They do not leak! They are tall and tippy. Too expensive to return them so I gave them away.
5,Spit Fire and Tomato Sauce,"What do you get when you mix Italian food, Baltimore, Family and Romance? You end up with a very comical,down to earth, pull at your heartstring novel by Millie Criswell.The Novel is called ""The Trouble with Mary"". Mary Russo is the middle daughter of an over protective; yet loving Italian Family living in Little Italy. Wanting to break away and become her ""Own Woman""; Mary starts her own Italian Restaurant. Enter Daniel Gallagher: Baltimore Sun Food Critic. This Food Critic has more then just a taste for Italian food. Sit back, and watch the Pasta Fly!"
1,"Been there, done that","I'm afraid I just didn't see the appeal in this book. The only reason I finished it was because I was hoping that it would get better (it didn't) and because I was amazed at the (lack of) plot. I agree with the reviewer who said that it was a lot like J. Evanovich's Stephanie Plum family, but it didn't hook me as those did. It was like a bad episode of those old Batman TV shows with all of that Zing! and Zam! going on. Sorry--there were too many bad cliches and too many predictable events. I'll pass on the next one."
2,Not very original,"I thought that the book was a lot like a bunch of other books all smashed together. The family was a LOT like Stephanie Plum's family by Evanovich. They were humorous, but I had seen them before. The dialog was funny in places and stilted in places. I did think that some parts were very humorous, but I didn't find it very original."
5,Attenzione!,"Attenzione! (Italian to English translation): Look out!There's a humorous book available on Amazon with lots of multi-faceted characters who pop off pages you can't keep turning fast enough. It's called THE TROUBLE WITH MARY. When you buy MARY, click on ""special instructions"" and advise them that you want Grandma Flora shipped with your order. She comes with modern wit, old Italian customs, and a police record.This one is laugh-out-loud from start to finish. And with an added bonus at the end--a teaser of what's to follow with Joe and Annie in Criswell's next book: WHAT TO DO ABOUT ANNIE."
3,a cute read,"This book was fun and sweet. I found the heroine's family a little too much, but overall, I enjoyed it."
5,Fantastic Music,"There are 13 songs on this Cd, and 13 reasons why I recommend this. From the first song to the last, Elaine takes you on a musical journey of transformation and inspiration. Elaine's style of music is enrapturing. Her blending of folk and the metaphysical leaves one breathless and wanting for more. This was the first Cd of hers that I purchased, but not the last. 'Lady Of the Lake' is actually a continuation of her 'Faery Goddess' Cd a fews years previous. Both Cd's are filled with songs of faith, folklore, and myth - each lifting up both God and Goddess through lyrics and music. Her Cd's, like her live performances, are magical. I highly recommend 'Lady Of the Lake' for anyone with an open mind and a love of music. You will not be disappointed."
5,Not for the novitiate...,"Provides a dense, tersely written introduction into Jungian dream analysis for those already with a background in psychology. Not for the novitiate."
2,I had to return this...,"I purchased this charger because I needed a backup for my work laptop. There were several options, but this was the cheapest one. I figured that a power cord is a power cord... I plugged it in, but it wouldn't charge, so I had to return it. I may have just received a defective cord, but I opted to buy one directly from Lenovo instead."
3,They need to make a 2-Disc Edition!,"It is a good soundtrack but some of the score is missing. Where's the piece where Peter is climbing on the wall and jumping off the buildings and shooting his web? Or what about the one where Peter is waking up in his room, looking at himself in the mirror, thinking that he's a superhero? Or the part after where Peter fights Flash and he runs across the street to the wall. I think they left some of the score out in the soundtrack and I really wanted to listen to those. The Parade Attack theme is great everytime when I listen to it I think myself as Spiderman. I think they should make a new edition to the soundtrack. The Green Goblin theme is great but still it looks like Elfman was a bit too tired of putting all those themes together in one place for a CD but it is great music to listen to if your an orchestra fan. I'm waiting for Spiderman 2 score to come out which doesn't till July 27th."
3,Great Griller!,This is one of the best counter top grills I have ever had. Its very high quality and is built very well. There are only two bad things I can think of with this product. It does make a mess more so then the regular George Forman type grill. The lack of sides around the grill plates means that greese gets all over the area you are cooking. So clean up is much more frequent. The other problem is getting replacement grills. The teflon does wear out over time and i found getting replacments are almost 40.00. Its cheaper to buy another grill with 2 new sets of grilling surfaces. Other then these two items- its a great unit.
2,Panasonic CV-50,"I bought this DVD player after my RCA quit reading disks after a few months. I liked DVD's so much I wanted to upgrade to a 5-disc carousel. I picked this one that was a display model at a discounted price of about $450 can. I brought it home and realised it was missing the power cord, which Future Shop forgot to include in the bag. It is the same as a Play Station so that problem was solved. It worked well for about a year, but now it starts skipping and going to a black screen after an hour or so. This is really annoying especially when you don't get to much time to sit down and watch a movie. I am now considering going to Wal-Mart and buying a $50 player since spending good money on what I thought was good DVD player made by a name brand isn't worth it."
1,I didn't get the item that was pictured.,"I didn't get the item that was in the picture. Instead, I got a cheaper version, that cannot be kept in the buttstock. I will be sending it back immediately."
3,Art Deco Acrobatics,"Douglas Fairbanks' second talkie (and first commercial failure) was this Depression-era romantic comedy. Seen today, ""Reaching for the Moon"" (1931) benefits from a lively cast, Doug's occasional acrobatics and William Cameron Menzies' stunning Art Deco sets. In his second film appearance, Bing Crosby croons Irving Berlin's ""When the Folks High-Up Do That Mean Low-Down."" An intriguing pre-Code curio. Unfortunately, the original 91-minute version has yet to resurface, with edited prints ranging from 62 to 74 minutes."
3,"Great hose functionally, but not as pictured. Has yellow stripes.","I'm sure this is a great hose in terms of functional quality, but it is not as pictured on the website. It has yellow stripes down the ENTIRE hose. For me, I wanted something that would look better and less conspicuous in my yard, so I am returning it and getting a hose from Home Depot. I'm a HUGE amazon fan... but somebody got the picture wrong on this one."
4,INSPIRED BY NATURE,"SACRED WATERS - Stories of Healing, Cleansing, and Renewal: Collected and edited by Maril Crabtree, this book has scores of personal stories about experiences with water. Written by numerous writers, the book tells of how water in nature has guided the writers to a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in life. From the gentle rocking waters of the womb to the wells of water from which we survive to various places beside or in earth's bodies of water to rivers that carry the creamated remains of loved ones, water is our life, not only physically but also emotionally and spiritually. These writers have revealed to the reader widely varied, personal, transformative experiences .Water had inspired in their lives. The stories are inspiring, uplifting, and calming...just as is water. A good book to inspire meditation and renewal."
4,"A Nice Album Of ""B"" Sides","A excellent album filled with various ""B"" sides & live tracks. The last track on the CD is out of place really but all in all a great record. Many of these songs can be found on the ""Time Traveller"" box set (4 CD's but 5 if you can find it) & Caught Live + 5.Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn, google or yahoo."
5,Good and Cheap,"This book is the most solid and clearcut, not to mention quickest, way to build your skills. The few errors that exist are minor and if you can't figure them out...then I'm not sure you have any business being an analyst (or whatever else it is you use spreadsheets for).Oh...and its dirt cheap!"
2,Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Step by Step,This book is good if you are going for your specialist certification. However if you are going for Expert level I did not find it helpful. There are a lot of items not covered in this book that you need to know for the expert level certification
2,Good sound...but they slip out of your ears easily!,I was really annoyed when they kept slipping out. You definitely can't use them to exercise. Looks like I will be searching for another pair almost immiediatly after buying these.
4,A Closetful of Doll Clothes,Great book for modern dolls of various sizes of the toddler body shape.Can be adapted to lots of sizes with fitting experience.
4,Great book for porcelain doll artists!,This is an awesome book for the doll artist. A wonderful grouping of costumes that most anyone will be able to use. Now all your little creations can have a pretty costume. Well worth the money.
2,Automobile Painting And Carriage And Wagon Painting,"Great title!I thought it sounded promising, but I wass dismayed- a tiny book of mostly text.I was expecting a few scrolls and other embellishments suitable for carriages to be discussed.I was let down. Did I mention how tiny the book was?It contains good historical stuff-but so do plenty of better books-that information is not scarce.I'm glad I had a look at it, but in hindsight would rather have kept my money."
3,so much better live,"i don't know what it is, but these guys can't seem to give me the goosebumps when i hear them on cd. i see them live and they are so good. the songs are exquisitly executed on stage. it looses its lustre on record though. they're good songs. this cd does have it's shining moments: everyday...all i ever wanted...i liked how they put my sharona into milkshake. pretty clever guys (?) 'ts good, 'ts good."
3,It suffices but,"P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage MonitorI think 2 additional features would bring this up to a 5 star for me. The unit needs back lighting so you can read the display. I have to use a flashlight to read it while plugged in. I would also like it to have a battery to run the display while unplugged. It just needs to display long enough for me to type my results into a spreadsheet. Despite my gripes, it has helped me to identify energy pigs around the house."
5,Works great!,"I was initially looking for an clamp meter to measure power usage but this device works greatand is cheaper too. Only hiccup is you may need a short extension cordto plug into some tight locations. Used it to measure power consumption and power factoron my PCs, PS3, Homeserver etc. Was not compatible with my Dryer plug but I don't thinkthis device can handle more than 15Amps anyway. Readings seem reasonably accurate as well."
5,Why?,product is excellent in all regards except one--it is very difficult to read the display when plugged directly into a wall outlet.
1,Poor quality,"Purchased at the end of December 2011 from Amazon. Using it with a 750 personal heater to monitor usage/cost. Device failed after about six weeks of usage. I was well under the devices rated 15AMPS and it should have safeguards built in to protect itself which apparently it doesn't.Called manufacturer and got nothing but ""attitude"" accusing me of overloading the product. Will not be purchasing another one! Need to look for a better built/better supported alternative."
4,power hungry devices beware,"This perform as advertised. You plug it in, push a few buttons and it'll tell you how much juice the device(s) are sucking up. Whether it's a single item or a surge suppressor, it'll tell you all the consumption details you need. Plug in the cost per kWh and you've got the total cost per the elapsed time. Calculations are there if needed as well to calculate day, month costs.As other reviews had mentioned the small text is hard to read without proper lighting and angle. You can get used to the pattern so there would be no need to look at the small text once you get used to it."
4,P4460 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor,"Although I cannot guarantee it's accuracy, I find the unit very handy and easy to use. My one complaint is that some of the LCD information near the edge is difficult to read. I would like to see the font size for that information increased. A back-lit LCD panel would be a big improvement.A hard-wired extension cable would make the unit easier to use especially when you have to get behind a refrigerator. I got around this by adding a six foot extension cable."
4,"It's useful, I like it... though an extender for the output screen would be nice","I like it, and am happy to learn the info it gives, but it would be nice if it had a cord on it to view the device's readings a few feet away from the wall socket, as other reviewers mentioned. That not that big a deal in most situations for me. It works well enough and I am satisfied."
3,Great for initial curiosity investigations,"This works well and despite some of the other reviews it seems to hold its settings during power outages, especially the cost per KWH setting.The biggest problem is getting motivated to check the larger electrical loads, such as the freezer or fridge (requires moving out from its hole to gain access to the AC power cord) and it cannot measure loads without a standard 3-prong AC plug, such as my shop air compressor, the house submersible well water pump, etc, nor the DRYER, likely the biggest power sucker we own."
5,Kill A Watt EZ P3,"The Kill A Watt EZ is a very simple instrument to operate, it gives every reading necessary to easily analyze your single phase equipment power consumption."
4,ok,i found this to be good to get a ruff idea as to how much appliances cost to run. i don't know how accurate it is?
4,Good product. Flimsy construction. A short cable should be provided at this price.,"Nice product. Works well. Plugging in and taking out is a hassle. If you are not careful, you can rip the plug underneath. A short cable should be provided with the manufacturer. Also, need a light source such as flash light to see display in small spaces such as under the computer desk."
3,Poor Display,"I have used this once and already see a problem with it.The display has poor contrast making it difficult to read in low light conditioP3 International Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor P4460 + Libarator 14"" Wirens. I had to use a flashlight to see the numbers and words. Since this unit will be used in low light conditions, the dispaly should be much brighter.Otherwise, it seems to work fine.Ed"
4,Interesting Product,Kill-A-WattEZ works well and gives the information as advertised. It would be handier if the display could be read at a comfortable stance.
3,Good electrical usage information,Easy to use and good electrical power usage information. Unit failed about 2 weeks after first usage requiring returning to P3 International for repair. Repair details unknown at this time.
