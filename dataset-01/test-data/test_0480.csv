2,Pre-Turtles,"A typical surf-group collection of songs.If you want to know what Howard Kaylan andMark Volman did a couple years before theTurtles came out, and you're a die-hardTurtles fan...then this is the CD for you.If not, save your money for the Turtlesgreatest hits. I bought this for the song""Santa and the Sidewalk Surfer""...a greatXmas song I have on a Turtles Greatest Hits LP."
5,Heartily recommended,"First In, Last Out was a book I couldn't put down almost from start to finish. I thought it was going to be about the courage and dedication of the NYC Fire Department - well, it was that and a whole lot more. I read the book several weeks ago and think often of passages that relate to day-to-day life, life in the business world, and how we can be better at all of it by following their ethic. It's a truly inspiring book - and full of real life adventure. The best of both worlds!"
5,Excellent for all professions,"As an officer in a volunteer fire department and having a real world management job, I was able to use everything this book gave me. At first, I did buy the book to be a better fire department officer but I found myself using many of the principles in everyday business life. This book is one of the easiest educational reads I've ever experienced. Hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I did."
4,"A nice design, but I'll keep looking","I purchased the 500p-UV to replace an existing filter/UV that sprung a leak in the seal that protected the UV light. The damage was going to cost $150 so I opted for a new unit. This one was a step down from the Oasis unit I had, but Oasis is no longer sold in the US. The problems I had with the Fish Mate were that the unit requires dissasembly for a weekly cleaning while better units only require the turn of a knob to back flush. Also, the 500 in the 500 P-UV means it works for a 500 gallon pond, but only a 350 gal/hour pump. The 1000 P-UV will go to a 650 gal/hour. That was not mentioned in the description. So its going back and I'm looking for a larger unit."
2,Not sure what everyone else watched,"Went into this movie truly hoping someone had actually captured an H.P. Lovecraft story on film. Though this title is loosely based upon the short story, it fell far short of its potential. Some of the acting was passable, but the psychologist featured in the film was brutal to watch. Overall it seemed a bit disjointed and far to artsy for my taste. Wonder why someone cant attempt to actually recreate a Lovecraft story rather then borrow from the essence of one."
1,Gave up on this book,"I really tried, but at one-third through I quit. I hated the characters. There wasn't a sympathetic one in the bunch. Plus, nothing happened. I have no idea who the hostile witness turned out to be because at one-third of the way into the book there was still no legal thriller. In fact, there was no legal or thriller. Nothing had happened. Shallow nasty characters and no plot. Don't know if it got better. Don't care. I must not have read the same book as all those who gave it 5 stars. I'm sticking with one star."
4,Good in depth surgical text,"Great book that covers a wide breath of surgical/medical knowledge. Not the easiest of reads but for the type of reference/text that it is, I find it smoother reading than others like Greenfield's."
2,"Too vague, boring to read","Unlike voluminous texts like Harrison's, I find this text written in such a fashion that it becomes a chore to read. Given, I am not going into surgery, but any well written textbook should hold someone's interest. I find the book too vague and low yield for medical students and probably too simplistic for surgical residents. Needless to say, I am going to try to sell it before the new edition comes out."
5,"A little smaller then I realized, but great!","I bought this for my husband, who has a lot (about 20) small plants that he needs to water. The part that holds the water is a little smaller then I thought it would be. He says he likes it though. I like the smaller size because I never accidentally water more then I should. Anyway we both really like how it works, and how it looks."
2,Not a great guide,"This book makes too many assumptions - i.e. that you want to run Linux alongside Windows on a partitioned HD and having a workstation alternative - which you may not.I am interested in a developement environment. The appendix hardly has any references to ""Apache"" or ""Web Server"" - and only covers one kind of install.They never address if you would like Linux as the only OS. Many of us have 100mhz clunkers that we're willig to wipe Win95/98 off of.I'm interested in having a local web server to test CGI's write code, and more. The book falls short. In fact I had to go out the O'Reilly Running Linux.I'm still getting frustrated trying to have Apache on the machine with the Gnome install. This book offers nothing in the way of setting up a web server (or very little to be exact!)"
5,Great Garage Parking Aid,"Mount the product on the ceiling, park the vehicle in the desired location, aim the laser. As you enter the garage just follow the red dot up the hood to your aim-point. Perfect park every time. I bought 2, one for each car."
2,"Accurate laser aim but ""ON"" time is too short","The Maxsa Laser Park is a simple motion activated laser pointer that help you position your car accurately in the garage. The installation and set up is very simple. Once setup, the red laser dot aims accurately at the same spot every time. The only trouble I have is that the ""ON"" is too short - 14 sec. It times out by the time the garage door is open and I pull up almost the right position. I have to lower the window and wave my arm outside to re-activate the laser. Manufacturer offers no help to fix this issue for me."
2,does'nt turn off when not in use,it works but stays on all the time. was supposed to go off in 14 seconds but it just stays on all the time
1,FAKE! DON'T BUY,"I installed this item the day it arrived, but the motion sensor worked unreliably, i.e. the unit failed to detect my car entering the garage 3 out of 4 times. After 2 calls to Maxsa I ended up speaking to the president who informed me that this wasn't his product, but a Chinese copy. The real Maxsa product comes in a plastic clamshell package and is silver. The rip-off fake unit is gray and comes in a white box. Amazon promised to refund my money, but I've written every day for four days requesting that they take this fake product off their site and inform the other buyers who were probably also defrauded. Each time I've received polite noncommital responses, but the item is still for sale! BEWARE!"
1,Advertising Misrepresents Product Capabilities,"The blurb on this product & the outside of the packaging both indicate this product will work on either household current or 9 volt battery.However, once you open the packaging & read the instructions, you find out that the battery function is for backup & emergency purposes only and will run the product for only a couple of days.This product must run from an outlet."
4,Good Product. Slightly limited range of movement,"As others have said with the product, the socket limits the range of movement of the lasers. While this only posed a minor challenge with my installation, it was easily overcome with a bit of effort. As interesting improvement might be if the manufacturer could split or splay the beam a bit giving a larger reference point to work with. All in all, very satisfied with the product for the price."
1,it only worked for 1 week!,this product worked fine for about one week. then for no apparent reason it got so dim that you can not see it if there is any light in the garage. very disappointed!
2,cannot aim laser's wide enough,"cannot aim the lasers wide enough. Might work for a very small two car garage where the cars are close together. My cars are about 10 ft apart and I cannot aim the lasers to hit either one of them when I place it in the middle. My celing is also a 7ft ceiling which makes matters worse. I tried a location on the wall, but still cannot get the lasers to hit either car.Also, although a nit - the picture shows a white transformer and power cord - I got black - sticks out like a sore thumb - I specifically ordered this one over another one because the picture showed a white power cord.Unit is going back."
4,Let the good times roll,"I love this book because I know the author. It's like having the best time of your life documented. Who could ask for more? Parties at a fabulous Spanish style villa in South Florida, drag queens, sexy gay models, alot of after parties, drama, mystery, and murder!"
3,Not bad.,I love the color. It doesn't stain your pocket. It stands out. I also found the rubber kind of hard with little bounce.
3,Well-built but hurts more,"I bought this hammer to replace my bright orange, toy-like hammer. This is well built and doesn't bleed on your white coat like other hammers. However, I found it hurts the patient more than my old orange. The reason: it doesn't bounce as well. It hits the patient with more of a thud. All that momentum is transferred onto the patient rather than recoil. I've seen many neurologist using it though. As a matter of preference, I like my old orange better."
4,SUPER NICE TV FOR THE MONEY,"I got a smokin deal on this tv. Only technically, it is a monitor and not a television (because it has no tuner). Which means it has no coaxial cable or tuner built in. You must either get HD service with your cable provider or use more basic means (as I have) and hook to a component like a vcr with a coaxial. It took me a while (and thank god for one of the reviewers on this site: R. Owens) who stated that you must turn off the speakers on the tv and use the only audio output (headphone mini-jack) that is available. I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to get the audio to come out of my home theater! Other than the lack of audio output, this tv has been great. I purchased a 1000 watt home theater system that just enhances the tv even more. Pretty sweet deal. The whole system with home theater cost under $1000. I know you cannot get a 37"" FLAT PANEL and home theater for that price. Merry Christmas to me! Thanks Olevia."
5,Simply Marvelous,"The Soul Influence's ""Persuaded"" is powerful!!! This C.D. is one that does not get its just due.There are many musicians/vocalists out there that are extremely successful! This group is one of the best groups that I have heard in a very long time that doesn't seem to get publicity. Well, I haven't heard of them. I took a chance and bought the C.D. because I read that these guys are young men seeking to do positive things for people. Boy, am I glad that I took that chance!! C'mon people let's get behind this group. They will bless your lives, I promise!!"
1,Did not stand up to weather conditions in NYC!,"DO NOT BUY. At $22 dollars this umbrella bent after less than 6 months of owning it. What makes it worse is that it happen while I was walking through the street of New York City. We don't have crazy winds or extreme weather here, and yet the umbrella couldn't handle it.In addition, the Velcro wrapping the umbrella is becoming loose and my typical usage is around once every one or two weeks.Definitely look elsewhere!"
3,well constructed but smaller than I thought,"This seems well constructed but is smaller than I thought. It's the size that when I'm walking during a rainstorm, the bottom of my legs get wet. Have to find something bigger."
4,Works and most importantly is a aesthetically pleasing tuxedo black.,"Great umbrella that is a great color. Works just as an umbrella should and it's definitely tough stuff. Only reason for 4 Stars is because it could have been a bit cheaper, I found it at a Marshall's for half the price on Amazon.Oh and as a side note, it's not as 'compact' as those handheld ones that could fit in a backpack. It's on the larger side but the plus is that you can have more shielding from the rain so I'm not complaining. Does come with a really nice black Samsonite matching carrying bag for the umbrella."
4,Still Hot in that Pink Bikini,"Ok, I admit, when I first bought the LP, many years ago, I bought it for the cover. Funny thing was, after listening to the music, I really came to love that album. It's mostly standards from the 30's, but it has the duet with dad that is great. All these years later, when I saw it, I had to buy it in CD form just to recapture my youth...and this time, only partly for the cover."
3,Missing CD!,"I was so excited to open up the book, because it claims it comes with a cd too, and I found the cd was no where to be found. Why did I pay the money and than not get the cd? I have already gotten rid of the receipt, since I received the package over two weeks ago and just barely opened it. I guess that is to say open everything, account for everything--don't assume. I love the music that accompanies the book as well as the story itself, so I am a little disappointed that amazon didn't come through this time."
4,I loved the characters,I've read the other Harris books too. She created such interesting people that i wanted to learn more about them. Harris writes easy to read books set on Cape Cod - a place I like a lot. Her books are a must for the beach.
2,A little disappointing.,"I'm a long-time fan of Susan Johnson, but I'm wondering what happened here. I thought the plot had a lot of potential (rakes being some of my favorite people), but too much sex seemed to take precedence over the story line. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come. Steamy is great, but not at the sacrifice of a good story."
1,Seduction in Mind,"...I don't know what happend with this novel, but it was absolutely awful! The characters were shallow, weak and irritating, the plot boring and the sex scenes tedious. Are we sure that she actually wrote this one?I'm re-reading Sinful and Wicked while I await Ms. Johnson's upcoming releases. Both excellent romances with substantial characters that you actually care about. Hopefully, the new books will be worth the wait. If not, it would appear that yet another Romance author has bit the dust and been stricken from my ""must read"" list."
5,Excellent read,"This book was inspiring & addicting! I did not want to put it down! Set in time we couldn't fathom living in, this story is so close to struggles we face now in our time. Francine Rivers is a true artist who uses her God given talent to reach so many people."
2,Not for me.,"I found it very hard to get into this book and find a value in reading it. I admit to only reading the first 100+ pages before putting it down and walking away. Why waste the time?The content of the first 100 pages was violent and quite grotesque which left me wondering where it could go from here. I saw little plot and little worth.I will admit the writing style of Francine Rivers was beautiful, but the content was definitely not for me."
1,Disappointed,"I am ashamed that a person who calls themselves Christian wrote this book. It was unnecessarily violent, vulgar and worldly in its sexual content. I felt violated while reading it. The ending was disappointing. I will most likely never read another of Ms. River's Novels."
5,Voice in the Wind 1 (Mark of the Lion),"""Voice in the Wind 1 (Mark of the Lion)"" Well written........ Thought provolking...... touched my heart..... Chalenges where I am now in my life and comminment..... Michael Cushman"
5,Truly an Unexpected Gift,"I received this as a graduation present, and at first I thought it was boring. I quickly realized how wrong I was and could not put the book down. It is captivating and emotional. I cannot wait to read more by Ms. Rivers!"
3,Much more then Christian fiction,"I knew going into these books that the content wasn't like normal Christian fiction but the sexual innuendo's I was not prepared for. It was all done to give an accurate description of the time and people and to show the debauchery of the time but it was hard to read and take in. Like a news show that tells you about horrible things that get stuck in your head, it's informative and now you know, but don't you wish you hadn't turned on the tv. I think that is how I am feeling now. It was an amazing book with great characters and an actual portrayal of the time but I found myself sickened and depressed at the level humanity can sink to. I don't believe I will be reading the rest of this series, not because it's not a good book I just don't want any more of that stuff in my head."
5,One of the best Christian books I've ever read!,You will not regret reading this series! It is wonderful! The second book is just as good and the third one is my least favorite but still worth reading.
4,Funny and weird.,"I first caught Os Mutantes in a Hoboken record store; I waslearning Portuguese at the time and recognized some of thelyrics. However, the funky guitar riffs and hilariousinside jokes really hooked me. This marked the beginningof my journey into Brazilian sound, which honestly looks tolast as long as any walk up the Amazon.Highlights are Bat Macumba and Cantor de Mambo, but a fewlistens will really turn you onto something different,guaranteed."
4,Good for First -Time Listeners,"Two great bands here! Maldita's ska-rock style is so catchy, it always sounds fresh.""Pachuco"" is one of the ultimate, all-time best rock en espanol tunes ever recorded. All the songs are good, really. If you can find this one used at a decent price, I'd reccomend it if you don't have any other recordings from these bands. It is a good aperitivo."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a cookbook that would help the new cook. The reviews I read sounded great, but this was not the book I was looking for. The recipes are ok such as they are, but I would not recommend it."
4,Tolcher Rocks!,"If you haven't picked up this album yet then what are you waiting for? Michael is awesome, the songs are great. I bought this cd after seeing him perform at a Gavin DeGraw cd. I had doubts that I would not like it so much, but I bought it anyway. He is awesome! I don't think he surpasses Gavin in any way, but he is right up there with him. I will be seeing him live again in a few weeks so all I have to say to anyone considering this cd is pull out the credit card and buy it! See him live as well if you ever get the chance, you won't regret it."
5,Our favorite British Mystery,We loved watching the last of the John Nettles shows. It will be interesting to see how the new Barnaby works out.
4,It was very well written; I really enjoyed it!,"This book was very exciting and enjoyable. The only problemwas that it did not follow the television show. In theshow, Sam couldn't leap out of his own life. In the book,he leaped over 200 years into the past. If you could getpast that, the book is still worth reading.Paul Marion Jr.Age 16"
4,Mele Kalikimaka..Got a 532 H code,"I was able to get the older 532H model, but I wanted the 537H. I was disappointed that Scientific Atlanta HDTV did not have a code for it. Finally sat down today & did the steps they tell u to do to find a code. It came out to be 0500.We have TimeWarnerCable here in Hawaii. Big difference now to be able to turn on/off both units, control the volume, mute, & change channels.Aloha & Mele Kalikimaka."
2,Mistake,"I usually get it right when I buy things because I do my research first. This time I blew it. The problem is the buckle. Entirely made of plastic it is a failure point ready to happen. But, for $8.00 dollars I should have known."
5,Awesome!,This is both my first year and my coach's at cheerleading. This book helped us a lot and I would recommend this book to everyone. It's very upbeat and informative.
1,summary of natural sciences clep test,"I tested in Aug 99 using Petersons, Princeton, and Amazon clep Books to study for the General Natural Sciences Test. None of these books came remotely close to helping me get 1% of the information presented as questions on the real test. Who ever made that test must have taken their information from the smallest corners of the earth they could find to make the questions. I still can't believe the vast difference between what seemed normal study material and what material was tested. Your company should go and take one of those tests and see how far out that test is compared to what you offer and get it in- line or you won't make much money or help people like myself to acheive a passing score using your books. Additionally, the study guide of which the college board offers is very vague. You could help all by re-doing your study material. By the way, I used the same books as mentioned above and tested high on the General Social Sciences Test."
4,Does exactly what it's supposed to do.,"Good quality, nicely sized. I use it to hold my train pass and metrocard, but there's ample room to add a few more items if you want to leave your wallet at home."
4,Decent Product,"I really like them. They are pretty and material is good. They are a little flimsy but I think they will hold up. The material is flexible so you are stuff them quite a bit. Hopefully the zipper will hold up, It is not a heavy duty one but I do like them."
4,cedar inserts not included with purchase,"My only minor gripe is that the cedar inserts are not included wih the product. Which is fine. I happened to have a few. Otherwise the product is fine and serves its purpose. If you're looking for a sturdy bottom, try another product."
5,Great appearance and sturdy,Very pleased with the Rubbermaid Storage chest! Especially like the handles and how sturdy it is and holds a lot. Really like the Cedar inserts and can label them too!
3,average...wouldn't buy again,"I don't have the ""Configurations System"". I was just looking for storage. I find these very flimsy. The canvas is not a fine weave so it will be a big dust gatherer withouth being able to really clean it. Haven't used because I need to cut a cardboard/wood an insert for the bottom to make sturdy enough to carry without collaspsing, or I will need to buy two of 22 gal rubbermaid inserts because I bought 2 boxes. I think I prefer the bags that you suck air out of. If you require the look..ok, but for storage it's not really what I hoped."
5,Wonderful buy!,"After the shoe box incident, I was skeptical about Rubbermaid items but I still went ahead and bought 2 of these because I need to store my winter clothes.When they arrived and I started filling them out, I was very impressed! The handles are very sturdy, there is plenty of space in them ( I was able to store ALL my winter clothes in 4 of them total!!)and they are not cumbersome to pick up or stack up.The only thing I found was the ""cedar strips"" are really small so I ended up adding some extra cedar blocks just to make sure the clothes will be ok until next winter.Great buy for the price!"
4,Storage Chest,Product was as ordered except I did not receive the cedar inserts. I would order again.
5,Finding Phyllis Hyman,"The ultimate collection by Miss Phyllis Hyman is a true treasure. I've been searching for a single particular cut off of the ""Can't We Fall in Love Again"" recording. I have never been able to find it until this recordings release.Anyone familiar with the sultry love ballads of the 80's knows what I'm talking about.Thank you to whoever put this compilation of recordings together.The Love Too Good To Last. Personal touch to Phyllis who will live forever in my heart.I hope to see you on the other side of heaven."
1,Ugh-Painful to wear,"As a 44DD it is HARD to find a bra that works out and this one just did not work out. This bra fits but my arms are resting on my boobs flapping out penguin like. The cups push your breast to the side way to far. The band is small and it is hard to get the hooks through the eyes. You really have to contort to get the bra on. Also, this bra pulls your shoulders back so far that I have a back ache right between the shoulder blades. Very painful to wear long term. I would not wear this to work again. The only positive is the strap adjustment is in the front."
3,It helps,"Ships fast! I had a few places (where plates sat on dishwasher rack) that the coating had worn off and the rack rusted. I replaced the whole rack once and it was very expensive, the new racks did the same thing. I was looking for a solution and found this product. It was easy to use and looked good. However, the coating has started to come off again where the plates rest on the rack. Nothing else bothers the coating, so I try to place the plates on another section of the rack to avoid this problem. I have plenty of coating left, so I can re-do it. I think that I will wrap the racks with some plastic or rubber tubing before I reapply. I'm really glad that I bought the product, but it is not the perfect solution, but it definitely helps and it saved a lot of money over having to replace the rack!"
4,it works - so far so good.,"the bottle and the product closely resemble white-out. You need to clean off all the rust, which can be difficult, and then build up a few coats of the product. It doesn't dry and clog like it warns. Just put back the cap as soon as you are done. and the price is right."
4,An amazing BSO,An amazing BSO . Very well integrated with movie's theme . Very modern for an Indian movie .
4,It doesn't leak so far,"Got this for my 2001 Lexus LS 430. Nothing really wrong with the original that came with the car except the rubber piece was worn. This comes in gold/copper color versus the OEM silver one. I guess now when looking for the oil pan it's dead easy to locate in the dark - LOL! These don't seem too expensive, yet probably unnecessary to replace each 6 months; maybe 24/36 months is better. Seems like it does what it should (no leaks so far) and with no obvious signs of poor build quality. Wish it was silver colored though."
1,Let Me Try,"I have not heard the cd, so how can i buy or rate something i haven't heard.So why don't you let me hear samples from it?"
5,Great album; fun to listen to,"This was my first Sufjan album after Songs for Christmas. It's got many good cuts on it (although I'm not sure newer Sufjan fans would buy into it quickly), and a few that will make you chuckle (Super Sexy Woman). I loved it and would recommend it."
2,So close to liking it!!!,"I love this music but I HATE THAT DOUBLE VOICE IN EACH EAR SOUND EFFECT!!!!!!!!!! Ok, there's not two of you ya know. The songs would have been perfect with a normal single voice track."
4,Besame Mucho!,"The man can swing! Danny has sung in Hudson Hawk, and another movie where he handled ""(Fly me to the Moon)In Other Words"" rather deftly. The tracks are well selected except the last two. I closed my eyes and pictured Mr. Aiello taking off Bob Fosse makeup while finishing the CD. Brrrrrr. This is a great CD to listen while driving on the turnpike or eating putanesca(sp)."
4,One of Nanc's best albums,It would be the last album she gave us solo till 1972's Woman and after that her music was even more scarce. This was part of Nancy's peak in output and like past albums-it has excellent originals and great covers. A Nancy fan must own!
5,Chuck captured the full range of emotions pilots felt.,"I went through flight school with the same class as Chuck, in fact we were roommates for a short time. I have an autographed copy of the first printing, and I was amazed at how well he captured the full gamut of emotions that all of us must have felt while in the combat zone called Viet Nam. Although his experiences were more varied than mine, we pilots all knew people who had similar experiences happen while in combat. Chuck relates his experiences so accurately, that I felt I was in the seat beside him. Good book and historically accurate from a pilots perspective."
4,A Hidden Gem,"It was great to see this album released on the MP3 format, and it sounds fantastic.As an avid fan of the Smooth Jazz genre since the 1980s and of Spyro Gyra in particular, 'Got The Magic' is a departure from the sound Jay Beckenstein, Tom Schuman, and David Samuels crafted and perfected during their tenure at Amherst/MCA and GRP from the mid 1970s to the early 1990s. When I heard 'Silk and Satin' (the first track on the album) on XM Radio's Watercolors, I actually thought it was another band. But sure enough, my radio listed the artist as Spyro Gyra. That's just how different and great this album is, and makes me wonder why I missed it back in 1999 when it was first releasd. Standout tracks include 'Silk and Satin', 'Got the Magic', 'Breezeway' and 'Springtime Laughter' with Basia providing wonderful vocals."
3,Time changes opinions,"It is funny that I read this book for the first time in the mid to late 1990's (maybe 1996) and loved it back then.Just re-read it today and found it to be very readable but not nearly in the 5 star class as I used to think it deserved.The story is ok, Kakonis blends humour with drama pretty well. It is a good crime yarn but just seems to lack some certain depth to it. Can't put my finger on it but I just feel it lacked something......"
3,"Good, but could have been better.","I liked the Jerky Boys first two albums alot. They were hysterical. After that, they just seemed watered down with there material.This collection seems to briefly touch the first two albums, but mainly focuses on the later material.Its not bad. Its entertaining. I just feel they could have picked the skits a lot better, and should have picked a few more from at least the first album.Not a waste of money to pick up."
5,Love this Horse,We bought this Aurora Plush Desparado Super Flopsie Horse for our granddaughter for Christmasl She love this Aurora Plush Desparado Flopsie Horse. She named her horse Willy after my grandparents horse that she loves!!
4,fits need for remote light,Excellant way to get remote light switch. Easy to install and use. Only con is it doesn't work with compact flourescent bulbs.
4,Excellent supplementary business reading!,"Upstart Start-Ups was a great read! It doesn't walk you through the process of starting a business like a guide, but it goes through the rough steps by explaining the actions and issues of various small businesses. Each part of the book contains a small introduction on the step or process in the business development process, then gives numerous examples of real people in those situations.If you are looking to start a business, this is not at all a primary read, but it gives some good advice, some good examples, and some good options for your business. This wouldn't be the only book I would read in starting my own business, but it was still very thought provoking and inspiring, and I'm sure I'll use it for reference in my own business ventures.As a side note, I will say that a lot of the suggested readings in the back are either very old, rather obscure, or ineffective, so just be wary."
3,Doesn't do what I wanted it to but great mouse substitute,"I bought the tablet because I wanted to draw my own images, makehand-written annotations. In particular, I hoped that I could use the pen tojot down notes instead of using a pen and pad of paper.The graphics tablet works great as a mouse substitute. Installation was a no brainer. I got used to using the pen within an hour.But..as a substitute for pen, this isn't it. In fact, I've been doing research on the Internet and there really isn't a true ""jot on paper"" substitute yet. There are applications that let you jot notes but not with the intuitive ease of having a small pad and pen next to you.This is a good product and I have no regrets around buying it. The main reason I gave my review 3-stars rather than 4 or 5 is because of thedeficit in the notes area (and market verbiage promises annotation features)."
4,Review of USB Tablet,"It is a very good product, I am a little dissappointed on the sensitivity. It is too sensitive and it is not easy to use the pen to write as I thought it would be. Perhaps it may get simpler as I use it more and more but if it had a way to choose the sensitivity it would definitely be a better product."
2,"Too heavy and ""sticky""","I did a TON of research before ordering this pan and decided all these glowing reviews couldn't be wrong. WRONG! It's just way too heavy for me to get down from the only place I have to store it, and then it's just super-heavy to move around. Maybe I'm just more of a wimp than the rest of these reviewers, but I'm sure there are a lot of women out there who would have the same problem. The other thing I'm not crazy about is how hard it is to keep looking nice inside & out. I think stainless steel just isn't for me, although I wanted to like it because it's supposed to be one of the safest materials for cooking. Oh well, I'll probably end up getting more hard-anodyzed pans. My very favorite is a rather small Bernez (not sure I spelled it right). Everything just slides right out, so there's virtually no cleanup. I love it, but their products are very expensive. Anyway, I wish I'd never bought this pan - now it just takes up valuable space in my small kitchen. :-("
2,Fantastics movies. Only German sound available!!!,If you can't speak German avoid this. You really can't understand these movies without knowledge of German language. I really wonder who was that genius who decided it is not possible to hear original english speech and soundtrack. Only dubbed German is available. 20 eur to the trash - wham!
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this product. It is too soft and I have found that products available at Target and other retailers are better.
4,might want to read this...,"This is my second review, due to the first being deleted for negative feedback. Concerning the product; decent glasses, very lightweight plastic frames, but good style and comfortable... possibly slightly over priced, but you get a good case and silk sleeve with the purchase."
1,These suck!,They fell apart like a cheap pancake the first week I had them. I will never again buy anything Jimarti. They sucked.
3,great product while they lasted. use for beach volleyball,"just what I was looking for. A sporty pair of sunglasses at a reasonable price with incredible visibility/clarity for my beach volleyball playing.comes with a case and a silk baggy. all very good quality.PS. Updating my earlier review above. After going through two pairs of these that ended up breaking at the same spot,(frame around the nose piece area) from just normal use(ie I wasnt smacked in the face with a volleyball or anything like that), and getting no response from the mfg for warrantee replacement, I am disappointed and decided to stop throwing my money away. I guess it was too good to be true. A real letdown also that I could not get any response from Jimarti on their supposed replacement warrantee.Seems from just taking them on and off your face these develop a wear point from flexing the frame that evenually cracks."
1,Junk!,"These sunglasses look good, but when you put them on it is like looking through a prism. The good reviews of this product really makes me doubt the integrity of reviews all together. Seriously, I wore them about five times and threw them away. I don't know if it is because the lense isn't perfectly curved or what, but there are points of distortion. The polarized sunglasses at Wal Mart's vision center are way better. Gas station glasses are better. My take is you should spend your money elsewhere!"
5,very happy,book is in excellent condition and recieved it very fast. hope to find more books i can buy from this seller.
4,When Will You Call,"Yes he has!!....Bilal has taken the next step in neo-Soul...and it's a doozie!! The energetic ""For You""...the graceful ""Love Poems""...all sound reminiscent, yet groundbreaking. A mix of hip-hop, jazz, soul and gospel. Yes, Prince did it....D'angelo is doing it now....and all of us listeners get to experience a ""Nu Thing"". Bilal...talk to me about directing the video to ""When Will You Call""....if it's done right it will take ""1st Born Second"" into the stratosphere!!! I would have given this CD 5 stars....but I still haven't heard anything that surpasses D'angelo's ""Brown Sugar"" CD."
5,Masterful Biography,"Joan Schenkar's Herculean research sets the standard for future biographers. Elegance and wit in every paragraph. An evocative recreation of the hot-house world of Parisian/Lesbian literati of the roaring 20's and 30's and Dolly Wilde's incautious place in it. Her elusive, charming, exasperating, ultimately heart-breaking story is so beautifully told, I couldn't put it down. I liken it to a gift box of exquisite bonbons, hand-dipped in Paris, perhaps sent by one of Dolly's wealthy, super-literate friends. So sinfully delicious, despite my dietician's warning, I'm about to read it a second time."
1,Waste of time,"I do love Sandra Bullock and that is the only reason I rented it. I set a record and pulled it out of the DVD player after three minutes. I usually give a bad movie longer than that. Forget this one. The sound is bad, the camera angles are hideous, the dialogue is forgettable and inane, the scene lighting horrific. It does not deserve a quarter of one star."
4,History and Sociology with Humor instead of Spin,"Miss these guys.Was happy to obtain the entire series.Convenient: CDs for each year in a multi-CD case.Look good, even on big screen."
5,Invigorating way to stretch & strengthen,"Well: Worked Out is a great way to unwind, strengthen & stretch. After doing this series of exercises, you'll have done some pilates, some yoga-type moves, and exercised some healing energy on yourself. You'll feel warm & stretchy after this regimen. One of my favorite exercise videos."
3,Not bad.,"If you follow the series then you may wonder how this book could possibly follow on from the last one. It doesn't. There is lip service to the previous books, but really this one belongs in its own pocket dimension. That said, it is only average for the series."
5,Another Awesome Entry in this Terriffic Series!,"If you're a fan of The Nightside series, Hell to Pay will certainly not disappoint. Five stars and three thumbs up for witty, snappy repartee, ass-kicking action, and solid characters that drive the storyline. I've quickly become a fan of this author's style and have JUST started picking up his Edwin Drood books. Keep cranking them out, Mr. Green! :) Awesome reading."
2,Dissapointing,I loved the Night Side when I was first introduced to it. It seems that the author is getting bored. I hope he regains his enthusiasm for this series because I quite enjoyed the previous installments. How sad.
3,Violet - takes a while to enjoy,"At first the smell is very overpowering - too much and almost artificial. However, after a few hours, it becomes much better."
5,Baby Formula,This was purchased for children in a battered women's shelter. I can only hope that it is an excellent product. The shelter is out of town and I do not get any feedback.
5,"A ""Must Read""","Nancy Hoag's book touched me emotionally and spiritually. I laughed and cried as I read her true stories and sensed the warmth of her spirit. She looks at life realistically and shares the lessons she has learned with her readers. The Fingerprints of God is a ""must read""--again and again."
5,awesome dude.,it was a great ppv because u get to see a texas seath match between cactus jack and vader which set the ecw standards for hardcore wrestling and u get to see vader toss cactus jack's salad
2,Sterile colours,"Brad Mehldau has rejected comparisons between himself and Bill Evans, going so far as to say that he himself is not particularly fond of Evans' playing. In listening to Mr. Mehldau, it becomes clear that this is so: the harmonic structure he employs in his chordal playing and development is rather stark and modal. Where Evans and other pianists employ voicings and inventive use of the left hand, Mehldau is not only predictable but morose and stuck in minor scales completely absent of any interesting key modulation. This album sounds like a mediocre new age musician trying desparately to play jazz. Another disappointing feature of this ablum is what appears to be an attempt to bring certain classical features to the mix. At times, it seems as if he wants to sound like Chopin's Nocturnes -- endless runs in minor modes and keys that lack all warmth, reverie, or introspection. Perhaps Mr. Mehldau ought to give Bill Evans a good listening to in order to learn something."
2,pedantic piano,"Sorry, I just don't get it. Listening to this, it seems self-indulgent and while I agree the techniques used are impressive, I keep waiting for the *jazz* of it to emerge. It's pretty, but this guy don't hold a candle to Bill Evans."
3,not the soundtrack,"bought the dvd and like watching it while gulping down RC cola ( yep, it's at the store ). bought the cd for the car. it's songs are not in the correct order, songs are left out, other songs not on the dvd are on the cd, and the RC cola commercials are all left out ( hey, where's art linkletter? ). this cd is not the soundtrack."
4,Satisfactory for the Renaissance Experts,"The Feud That Sparked the Renaissance is a book that is skillfully written and filled with specific information. That said I feel that the average person could purchase the book and feel that they could enter it's world without a deep and preexisting knowledge of the renaissance.For the experts on the renaissance that feel as though they must soak up every available fact that pertains to it; this book is for you.For the rest of us that merely want an introduction to the subject, the search presses onward; this book is not for you. (unless you are particularly diligent)."
2,a bit displeasing,"Perhaps, my expectations of this book were too high. I was looking for an amusing, yet somewhat historically thorough book. It did indeed have many underworld entities I had never heard of before. However, there were also ridiculous entries that in my opinion, were wasting space: comic books, video games, David Letterman (for saying, ""this show's going to hell""). What is that? The only entry I immediately recall not finding is ""Diablo""... they at least could have put it under video games... I mean, they had ""Doom""."
4,A real contact fromHell,"Well, it is just what it says, a nice center of information about hell, the number of qoutes are amazing, i cpuld be a little bit more detalied but its enough to start an investigation."
2,An well thought out introduction to Photoshop.,"A book with an interesting concept, well written and organized for the purpose of guiding the novice Photoshop user through a complex application. This said, the accompanying CD-ROM is virtually worthless with many missing, misplaced and mislabled images that making using it with the accompanying text either difficult or impossible"
3,peel and stick lights are handy,I had to use two in my computer armoire to see - but they are as described - it is a little annoying to get them to turn off and on - I usually have to hit the light two or three times - but all in all they are fine
3,Small and handy,These lights are small and handy. They work well. They don't illuminate a very wide are though but can help you see what is right inm front of you well enough.
1,NONE of the 3 lights worked; trouble and disappointment,"Now I have to go to library to get return label printed, then take the package to UPS. All because of these being DOA. The idea is fantastic and I was really looking forward to lighting up some dark places."
3,It Broke Immediatiely,"We bought this as a present for my younger son, and when it arrived, he loved it. However, after a few hours of playing with it, the seams broke apart and you can't fix it (we tried). Also, the rubber tastes like the smell of car tires, so you should save your money."
1,Don't bother!!!,"This is THE LAMEST version of a whoopie cushion I have ever seen! Unless you enjoy trying to get the end open and manually blowing it up after every use, don't even bother. We will be buying one that refills itself after each use. This thing belongs in the toilet!"
4,Lesser Known Works of Michael Card,"I have been a fan of Michael Card's music for well over a decade. This album is one of his lesser known works and was inspired by the book of Hebrews in the New Testament. The CD features ten songs. Musically I found that two songs appealed to me above the rest; ""Pilgrims to the City of God"" and ""By Faith,"" never-the-less the rest of the songs had ""real meat"" in their messages. Two songs are duos, one a remake from a previously published song. There was scant information in the CD cover...neither lyrics or scripture references though perhaps there was originally (I bought from a reseller). I would recommend this to anyone familiar with and a fan of Michael Card's other albums, but would choose one of his more popular albums as a gift to those who may be hearing Michael's music for the first time. Michael Card is indeed a wonderfully gifted artist whose music has often nourished and helped anchor my soul. Enjoy!"
5,Great music!,"My family and I have followed his career for several years now, and we own most of his albums. (Anybody want to sell me a copy of 'Legacy'?) I must say that this is his most in-depth album yet, both musicly and spiritually. Enjoy!"
5,"""My Life With the Wave"" is extraordinarily imaginative","I love books that begin with a fanciful, ""what-if"" premise. In this case, what if a sliver of the sea -- a wave -- followed a family home from the beach like a stray animal? The illustrations, humorous in a borderline-grotesque way, capture the muscular spirit of this fantasy. I need not convince my children to read this story again and again, and they need not waste time coaxing me. I love it because it permits every reader to imagine the delightfully surreal."
4,Very Good!,"I expect more copies of this CD would sell if samples of the Grand Wilshire Swing Suite were made available. The best song on the CD is 'Easy Come, Easy Go'."
1,How the Hell did he get signed to any record label???,"Eamon is just another Panty Man screaming like a B$*&ch just because some woman left him. No womder why she left you, you are too girlie. And another thing Eamon, if you're going to use all this cussing in your music, Rap it Don't sing it. I just can't imangine Diana Ross saying ""F$#^& You You H*"" in one of her songs. Eamon Sucks."
1,OMGGG,"GOD WTF IS SOMEONE THINKING??????????????? THIS GUY SUCKS!!!!! While the whole ""F*** You right back"" and ""F*** it i dont want you back"" song wars are ENTERTAINing...... this ""I love them ho's"" video just came on launch.com and omg this guy sucks DO NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPPPPP! It isnt even worth 1 star! if this cd was one cent at wal mart i still wouldnt buy it. Crappiest CD of the um decade."
2,Anyone Can Curse,It's nice to hear a guy get emotional and express himself through song. So when the opening of the lead single and title track floats over the radio i'm thinking yeah i like this this is how i felt about some B at a point in time. When I looked up info on the disc I thought this was the male eminem but after listening to the disc twice I realized this is kinda lame. This is Jive's attempt to make lots of sales off of the shock of cursing in R&B songs. Here's a thought rappers have been adding their profanity to R&B for years. Since Eamon doesn't really have much to say it kinda makes the whole album very very very immature. I expect this to be a hit among teenage boys and the young college boys and maybe goofy girls who think this is funny (even though their being degraded). As a grown *ss man i'm here to tell yall *itches that *uck it just buy the single.
1,Worst CD,This has to be one of the worst cds i have ever heard in my life i would give it 0 stars if i could. this is not music its just bullsh*** ...if u want a real cd get Kanye West College Dropout
1,Whining and swearing,"""I don't want you back"" really got into my head. Thats not to say it was a good thing - the only reason it gets stuck in your head is because its dull and derivative. It's like a little tune you could make up yourself and hum under your breath - not great material for a song. That was why I got the album - in the naive thought that if I listened to it enough it would get out of my head, or atleast I would be able to find another song more annoying to replace it. I have to say, the album isn't all that great. The songs are all just as dull and derivative as ""I don't want you back"" and most of them aren't even as catchy. Eamon's voice is average, if a little whiny. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want swearing, whining and more swearing - and if you want that I suggest you buy Eminem songs."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Terrible, absolute rubbish. He can't sing and he can't rap, and he can't write. Don't waste your money. Buy some quality hip-hop, such as Masta Ace's 'Long Hot Summer'."
1,Contains lead,"The little note attached to the hose warns about the hose having lead and that I should wash my hands after using it. Not exactly something I'd like to water my strawberries with or have my kids play with! I don't see the lead mentioned in the product overview, so I just wanted to add that."
5,It Does In Fact Last,"I have tried products from Chemical Guys and Surf City and etc. They all look great but don't last. This product, having driven around in snow, salt, and sand for the past three days, is still holding up. I am very impressed. But, it is very glossy. So if you are not a fan of super shiny tires, after applying the product with a foam applicator, wait 10 minutes and wipe your tires down with a towel. That should take the edge off the shine. This stuff also drys pretty well too. I have used this around the house on all things plastic/rubber/vinyl and in the car and on the trim. So far so good. I like it it a lot. This is not a water based product. In any event, I do not know how it compares to other oil/silicon based tire shine products. There are no shortage of them."
1,disappointing,"Mine was in the garbage within a month of receiving it.Upon opening it, I was actually pleased with the work surface ... looked nice, good size and the pencil box holder was a added bonus to hold some small items .... like a pen.That said, the pencil boxes are awkward to open, the cushion is too stiff and dosn't cover the entire bottom so it makes the thing off-blance and awkward. The deal breaker and what landed it in the trash was that one of the buttons on the cushion came off and those little, microscopic white styofoam ""beads"" where EVERYWHERE! And ... with all the static electricity from them, they're near impossible to clean up.The concept isn't bad ... but the design specifics and quality are not good. I'm reluctant to buy another from Amazon or Maxi as a result!"
3,"Nice, but needs more padding","The top of the Euro desk looks nice, the handle at the top is also a nice addition. It's definitely not too big and bulky compared to other lap desks, but that's one of the problems because the pillow-padding underneath doesn't have a lot of padding.If there were more padding, it would be a great lap desk. The pillow underneath can be removed (it's attached by Velcro). So if you have something else to replace the pillow with, it could work better."
2,Bad antenna,"Had the same issue as most of the reviewers. Went out it less than a year. Just completely stopped working one day, but my home antenna still works with the unit. I hope I can find another one that works better!Directed Electronics 14120 Ultra Low Satellite Radio Car Antenna"
1,Awful product - poor quality,"I've had Sirius for one year. I purchased my radio through Sirius and this antenna came with it. I then ordered another car kit for my other car which came with this antenna as well. After 6 months one stopped functioning and I was stuck ""aquiring signal"" so I tried the one from my other car and it worked. I ordered another one of these to replace the broken one and within a week my 2nd one stopped working. I connected the third one and after 2 months I'm getting a ""cannot locate antenna"" error. I'm now searching for an alternative as not to waste any more money on this product that just doesn't last."
3,ain't robbie,"well that's not true - sure its really robbie. But, if you got turned on to robbie by any of his cds before or after this one's release then i want to stress - don't believe the hype of the other reviews. Its like owning the first 4 elvis costello albums and having somebody tell you again and again that imperial bedroom (ballroom?) is where its at. artists branching out? well this is obviously a lil detour. I love Robbie but this ain't my Robbie. I'd say that this rf is easier for me to agree with than ec and imp bed/ball but still I'LL LISTEN TO THIS LESS THAN ANY OTHER ROBBIE FULKS CD."
4,I loved it.,"Some songs sounded pretty different from the actual songs, but I liked it anyways. I loved the beat in ""Chim Chim Chir-ee"" and ""You Got A Friend In Me."" I especially loved ""Reflection."" It was very beautiful and sounded oriental, too. My whole family likes this CD, and your's may as well."
5,Mannheim Steamroller Meets The Mouse,I bought this CD about a year and a half ago. I love it. My grandchildren all love it. They can identify most of the movies as soon as the selection begins. Three of them are getting it for Christmas this year.
4,Horror Movies as Graphic Novels,"This graphic novel, based on a soon to be released feature movie, is first of its kind; Horror Movies as Graphic Novels, an interesting concept. The plot is a labarynth of questions and problems the characters have to solve, and is well-organized into this comic book format. This is a must have for any movie buff waiting for the next ""big thing."""
5,Very clear and helpful,This book is an excellent source for understanding color science and how to correct color using Adobe Photoshop. It includes easy-to-sue methods and tips I found very useful in everyday image correcting.
3,"Great detail, hard to apply","The information in this book is very detailed and explains a lot about the theory of color and color correction. But, from a hands-on perspective it lacks the necessary information to easily utilize the information described. Also, it's almost impossible to read without falling asleep."
2,basic baby formula milk,these are value priced formula . my daughter didn't like the taste of it . amazon sells it in pack of 6 . I would recommend you buy one pack locally before buying online .
3,Rings are poorly spring loaded,I just got this and it was the quality I expected....basic. The plastic is firm but I would not stand on it. The plastic clips and handle are of adequate quality.My key gripe is the rings on the binder do not press together firm enough when closed. This is creating gaps that are tearing at my PrintFile negative sheets when I turn the pages. This is definitely not what I expected and I will probably end up not using it.I purchased this thing to replace the standard fare 3 ring binder that holds traditional ruled paper. Those rings were much stronger at staying closed. I do believe the the 3 rings are removable from the box. I might just pull them out and use it as a storage box and bind together the negatives another way - perhaps with large binder clips or something.Overall it was not what I expected so I'm giving it only three stars.
3,Accoustic Music..,"I wasn't sure how much I was going to like this CD. I bought it for the David Arkenstone track, which I hadn't heard. Turns out to have a very accoustic feel to the whole thing. It's mostly stringed instruments and piano. Quite cool as background music. Not really to sit and listen to attentively, but for when you're doing stuff, this is great to have on. Angels of Venice do an awesome version of ""As Tears Go By"", and track 4, ""Shaka Slack Key,"" which you can hear in the song samples above, is almost worth the price of the CD. On the whole, the CD doesn't really stand out, but it's worth getting."
4,An Unknown gem,"An excellent practically unknown gem of an album.The band is very tight, the recording excellent(and I only have the LP as yet)and Peter Frampton'sguitar work is among his best."
3,Mickey Floor Mats,Product is fine but they don't seems to be as heavy duty or as thick of a rubber as I thought they would be. Other then that they work well.
4,Cuddly stuffed animal,We have five huskies and got this for our son for his first Christmas. It is really good quality and he loves it.
2,"Poor character development, vanishing plot line, historically implausible","I've read most of M.C. Beaton/Marion Chesney's books, and this was by far the worst. The main character doesn't stay in character, and is annoyingly inconsistent. The villains are so poorly developed that the end scenes almost make no sense, especially as they been irrelevant to every other part of the book. The use of photography as it is done in the book is historically inaccurate, and the little sidebar of the king of England visiting his mistress was pretty nasty and gag-able, it really didn't fit the book.Overall, it is hard to tell if this was meant to be a mystery, a period piece or just a sappy romance.This story was such a weak effort from Beaton/Chesney that I take it as a sign this writer is past due for retirement."
4,me again,"I completely forgot about the sad and lovely acoustic song ""Eyesight to the Blind"" that Brian performs. See my other review below for info on the rest of the CD."
2,NOT What I Expected At All!,"I wanted a book describing the personal experiences of people who had been declared dead, had been unresponsive, and then 'come back'. This is a book about ghosts and people who experience 'ghost encounters'."
3,after life encounter,This book goes all over the place. It's more like her personal journal or experiences. Very disappointing for those of us that are really into this subject.
3,Howard Wells,"I like this album because it takes me back to that period of time--I can feel it. Jerry gets a call from Howard and they jam. There are some real good moments in the music, but don't expect too much because its unrehearsed. Like it for what it is, four excellent musicians jamming. Its also nice to hear Garcia playing Jazz. So what if its not perfect, I'm just glad its there. If you have a Garcia/Dead collection, Side Trips is a great addition."
1,Skip this trip,"It sounded as if the previous reviewer did not like this cd at all, yet they still gave it four stars. I am not as generous with stars.Most of the harmonic ideas Wales lays down here just sail over Jerry's head and he continues on with some rather directionless noodling. Yes, there are several minutes worth of mediocre moments on this cd, but generally speaking, it's playing like this that makes people think that Jerry was not a very good musician.For as incredible as Garcia was in the Grateful Dead in 1970, he's the exact opposite of that here. Go elsewhere if you want to hear Jerry play great. Buy this if you just want to hear Jerry play something you can make fun of."
5,An important and historic recording,"What makes this such an interesting recording is that Annette Peacock the composer of all but one of these pieces, was married to both Gary Peacock (on bass), and later to Paul Bley (on piano). It was the Austrian trumpeter Franz Koglmann however, who came up with the idea of an album of Annette Peacock's music, and did some of the arrangements. Superb musicianship, Superb music. A must hear for any Annete Peacock fan."
1,Not as advertised,This item was purchased for use with a Sony camera. It does not work well at all and has caused me to lose several pictures. It was recommended as an alternate to the original Sony disk. I wish I had not purchased them
2,it was a mistake,My fault I bought the wrong discs...the vendor did their job sent on time and the order was what I had requested they are sitting in my office drawer. with the way technology changes my SONY handy cam will be obsolete soon so won't need these discs
3,"A ""must"" for a container gardener",A hose end bubbler is a simple but very helpful watering tool -- especially helpful for container gardening. The bubbler just stops the possibility of erosion from an uncontrolled hose discharge. It allows watering with full hose volume without eroding the soil in the container/etc. The water gently flows from the bubbler. This model works very well and is relatively inexpensive. The only negative is that it is constructed of thin plastic and is susceptible to damage. The manufacturer also makes a metal hose end bubbler for not much more money. One would think the metal unit is susceptible to corrosion -- which would be its negative.
5,"""Scream"" meets ""Phantom Of The Opera""","I am so glad I bought this movie it was realy scary and fun.The only thing that sucked was the opening murder scene(It did look like the opening of ""Halloween"" in a way).But other than that it was good it also stars that one girl from ""Fresh Prince Of Bel Air""."
2,typically boring.....,"good plot, good cast...typical characters...death scenes we have seen thousands of times before...and an ending that comes too quickly..this was one of the worst slasher movies that I have ever seen....too boring...too stupid....and not very interesting....."
3,bow street runners,"Wow! Really surprised to see the album on sale again after all these years. I am one of the original band members and did a good bit of the back-up vocals for this album. Haven't seen the other band members since moving from Fayetteville,NC (where the album was recorded) some twenty odd years ago. If you guys are still out there and reading this, call me in Galax, VA. I'm the only Dees in the phone book. Would love to see you guys one more time. Peace to all! The 70's are still alive!"
2,Source code in Web is a bad choice,"This book lays out the compiler's source code in Web (think Knuth), in which instead of seeing an entire program, you see a small fragment, and notes to look up the rest on a different page. In my opinion, this makes the book nearly impossible to read.In its defense, however, the book addresses many of the engineering concerns with writing a compiler, such as data structures or memory management strategies. This is cool.Also lacking in this book is a good description of advanced optimization techniques and modern intermediate representations."
1,Horrible.,"I deeply regret buying this book. I was so excited to find a comprehensive history of the werewolf. Unfortunately this is the worst written book I have ever had the displeasure to read. The author is long winded and rambling sometimes briefly touching on a story only to get caught up in endless side stories before eventually wandering back to the original story. I can honestly say I've never hated a book, but this book takes the cake. I hope no one ever makes the terrible mistake of buying this book. I wont even resell my copy, I don't feel I can do that to some poor soul. This man should be kept away from publishing permanently."
4,They're back!,"""Persevere"" ranks right after ""Sunshine on Leith"" for accessibility and sheer fun! The opening track (There's a Touch) is a real toe-tapper along the lines of ""500 Miles"". (Catch the video at the Proclaimers' website for a laugh (proclaimers.co.uk) ""Scotland's Story"" is a pleasant story of multiculturalism. ""She Arouses Me So"" made me laugh, first just reading the title, and then listening to the song.I've been a big Proclaimers fan since 1988, always hoping for a new record. ""Hit the Highway"" was disappointing -- dour and unmemorable. But with ""Persevere"" the Proclaimers are back and just as good as ever. If you liked ""Sunshine on Leith"" or ""This is the Story"" you'll enjoy ""Persevere""."
4,"Great wastewater alternatives overview, esp. for the UK","This is a good way to get acquainted with some alternatives to conventional septic systems. It's terminology and other information is more geared to Britain, so North American readers might find it is not as directly helpful as they'd like, but the easy-to-read format makes it a good addition to designers' collections."
5,Best Christmas Carols I Know,"I've listened to these carols for Christmas since I was a kid. We had only an old LP at the time. They are by far, the best collection of Christmas songs I know. Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner would not be the same in our family without having these carols playing."
5,Alfred Burt and Wihla Hutson,"Wihla Hutson was my mother's choir director in Detroit, MI. I remember the poetry of her Christmas cards that later became Alfred Burt Christmas carols, in particular Caroling, Caroling. Our Christmas is complete!"
5,Don't pass up this wonderful movie!,"Like 99.5% of the reviewers, I loved this movie. Of course, I'm a fan of Alexie's prose and poetry and I'm delighted to see his work adapted for the screen. The casting for Smoke Signals is great--the actors who played Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-fire were mesmerizing and the chemistry between them palpable. The ending echoes long after the movie is over. I can't quite grasp where Mr. Maltin is coming from."
5,Enjoyable,"The film Smoke Signals truly gives a new outlook to the workings of life on a Native American reservation and insight on Native American culture in general.Because of the fact that this film was written, directed, produced and acted in by Native Americans. The viewer gets to see a unique point of view that is rarely seen if seen at all. Characters of the movies are also played uniquely. Especially Thomas, without him the movie would have been boring.I recommend anyone to watch this movie. I believe anyone who enjoys something new and funny should see this film."
2,Goofy but okay,The movie is too goofy to actually take it seriously. The main guy's hair is okay in the beginning but when he cuts it shorter it makes him look like a housewife. Which was funny. Ha HA ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha.
4,"Laughter and Tears, on Indian Time","This is quite a wonderful film that, from a cultural perspective, every American should see.While there is some agenda concerning racial and cultural bias, the film navigates these loaded issues with a delicate hand. There is no strong-arming of the audience here. Ultimately, the story is about the ties that bind us together.Thomas and Victor are a sensational diad, the perfect odd couple out on an Odyssey of Homeric proportions. Granted, the source and goal of the journey comes from pain, but the characters don't drag their souls through life as eternal victims.This is a triumphant film, as joyful as it is sad.And as we all know, you can't have one without the other.BrutusEcho Detained"
4,Smoke Signals- Awesome movie!,"I love this movie, it is so funny! I can relate to the jokes, etc. in this movie, we (Alaskan Natives) are a lot like Native Americans in many ways."
5,Accurate portrayal of young native american men,"Growing up in the U.S. as an Native American, I never could express how it felt. This movie gives people a chance to understand us. My favorite line in the movie is regarding watching Indians on TV. This movie rings true! A definite must see!"
3,Pretty Good!!!,"I watched this movie last week, and it was better than I expected. The movie centers around Victor and Thomas; two friends from the Coeur D'Alene Indian Reservation in Plummer, Idaho. When Victor's dad dies in Arazona, the two head out on a road trip to bring back his ashes. Along the way, they learn about who he was and how they were all close. I'd recommend SMOKE SIGNALS!!!"
1,Did not fit,I had to force this into my furnace to fit because I didn't want the hassle of returning it. It is a quarter inch too fat and next time I will stick with honeywell.
2,A great band but a poor recording...,"The Coffin Nails have without a doubt played during their career numerous gigs that were worth recording, so why did Link records release this particular show on record remains a mystery. And why Cherry Red/Anagram reissues it is another mystery. Recorded in late 1989 in front of a small crowd (so small you can't barely call it a crowd), they seem totally unrehearsed: the drummer (who only played on this album) is sometimes off beat and Humungus makes mistakes one after another and almost forgets the lyrics of the songs. Even Humungus admits that this records is their worst one. It's a pity because when you look at the setlist it could have been a great album including all their classics. Prefer to this album the live compilation ""Sick Sick Sick"" (also featuring Skitzo and Demented Are Go) or their most recent live album ""Big Night Out""."
5,"Great variety, quick, easy and delicious",One of the first books I look in when I have to come up with something fast and that will dazzle . I find that I have many of the ingredients on hand and can pull off a variety of dinners when time is limited. I enjoy involved cooking too and trying new recipes but I don't always have the luxury. Lots of the recipes can be done ahead as well and freeze well. I kept several copies to give to friends and now find that I cannot get more copies anywhere.
2,Please...this was not a book,"This was a stack of future storylines. The author got me to buy a book, because of previous quality writing, very unfairly, we get a handful of chapters, with no closure on anything... the ""run over to Paris to let Jim see his girlfriend dog, was nothing more than a ploy to introduce the Prince of Hell...not handled with panache. The is she using dark powers is she not storyline, the mother-in-law from hell, the occasional ""hot"" sex scene-- too many storylines, to many cliffhangers. Please this is not the ""perils of Pauline"", but I sure expected the heroine to be tied to a the rails, and the on-coming train rushing down, the Blue Dragon twirling his mustache...no wait that was what happened when the Green Dragon challenge ploy was undertaken. Ms. MacAlister, for shame."
5,Very funny....,"The Aisling Grey books, always bring a smile to my face. So many times I was laughing out loud. This is a must read for every fan and the end is very surprising, makes me look forward to the next one. I just love the easy style it is written in and the story itself doesn't get boring. Thumps up!!"
3,"Whine, whine, whine","The character, Aisling, has to be the most consistently annoying character ever created! She is never happy. She goes from one self-created crisis to another, constantly whining about how she only wanted to be a Guardian but makes little effort to be one. Some one wants to kill her and she ends up wanting to save his life. Totally clueless."
3,"Good structure and review of basics, but now out of date.","This book is well structured and well written but is now out of date. After going through some very useful basics on deciding whether franchising is right for you and how to approach franchising, it then focuses on how to read a UFOC. This document has now changed to the FDD, which has a slightly different format than the previous UFOC. The examples are also rather dated. In sum, a good book for its time but I have found up to date books on Franchising to be more useful."
5,Love It!,"My wife and I have been using this book for morning and evening prayer since 2000. The prayers are positive, often earth-centered, and without excessive penitence. I have recommended it to many whom I see as a spiritual director."
3,Mixed bag...,"Tribute records are always mixed bags.First off, you need a good band to cover, and we certainly have that with The Who. In my opinion, The Who were the first commercial punk band - not the Sex Pistols, not the Ramones. The Who fused the punk attitude of Robert Johnson with the raucous possibilities of rock-n-roll. Sure, they became stadium rock dinosaurs, but they didn't get their wish of dying before they got old.Second, a good tribute album should have fresh interpretations that add to the value of the original tunes. Here's where things fall apart. While many of these songs are entertaining (how hard can it be to re-record an acceptable take of a good song?), only a few make meaningful contributions to the legacy of The Who.Who fans with a taste for alternative music will find this to be an interesting collectible. However, Who fans that prefer AOR-fare will want to pass."
5,makes a great gift,"This was a gift for my grandson. He was very happy with it, so I'm very happy with it too!"
3,quick delivery,This book arrived quickly and in excellent condition as promised. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The book itself focuses on English and Italian women but gives an appropriate and fair representation of women from the period.
2,Kat,"I thought that the book was alright. It is interesting enough to grab your attention, and hold it but not enough to be particularly memorable. It leaves you with a lot of questions about the characters and how they end up. I think that it would have been better if she had been able to develop each character seperately and with their own book and gone into the relationships between them a little more. It had her trademark fantastic love scenes-but when you barely know the characters and you don't get a chance to know them you are left feeling rather unsatisfied."
3,Could have been better,Really nothing to praise about this book.I still love susan johnson writing but this book just didn't have it.In a few words blah blah blah!
4,Susan Johnson,"Love the way she writes. Characters are always fun and interesting. This heat could have been brunette, redhead, or bald and it would have been just as fun.Good Job, again, Susan."
1,HORRENDOUS & A WASTE OF MEDIA & MATERIAL!,"The movies on this DVD are horrendous even for their time. These are among the worst movies ever made in all of human history. The video quality is remeniscent of 1970s TV commercials shown in third world countries. The translation and acting is so bad it makes me want to stand in a bucket of water as I touch live, frayed, electrical wires to myself watching ""Lord of the Dance"" starring Michael Flately. I hope one day all of the original films are found and destroyed. Absolutely horrible!"
4,Talk about Revenge!!,Harris writes about wonderfully real people in her stories. You get to know them. Her police investigators don't let go for one minute. They keep going unitl they solve the crime. I liked the way Harris keeps the police investigation moving along with the personal relationships of the characters.
4,Great relationship story,I look for authors who keep the same characters from book to book. Harris has found a wonderful formula for the people she has created. You learn something new in each book. Count the Ways is more romance and relationships then a murder mystery. The police investigation is to the point and moves along. I like the people in the book.
3,Product review,"This product did create flakes, I purchased it because of other reviews stating that it did not create flakes in your hair."
3,Not the Best of...,It is a nice collection but it isn't the Best work Old Waylon did. You do get a lot of music for the money so not too much to complain about.
4,Where Have You Gone Joe Dimaggio...,"This book goes in several different directions, primarily chronicling the depravity of sellers like Victor Conte and users like Barry Bonds and Marion Jones. It's certainly hard to imagine anyone having much sympathy for these people if he/she has given even cursory consideration to the wealth of factual material presented in the book. The news media had provided most of the basic information beforehand, but I was still glad I read it. The authors did a nice job tying threads together and should be commended for their work. Still, I come away thinking that they have only managed to reveal a small tip of a very large iceberg. There is too much money and too much science involved for this problem of performance enhancing drugs to be easily confined, or to just easily go away."
1,Horrible and unacceptable.,"I've had these for three months now and they are the worst cables I have ever purchased. The build quality is very bad, and the volume dips and increases every few min. I do not recommend these at all."
2,Junk,"In airsoft, there is a well known phrase, ""You get what you paid for."" These are cheaply made lasers and do not last long. They may seem fun at first, but thats it. They will break. Its not a matter of being careful with it, its a matter of time."
5,My favorite penne,"Deboles makes fabulous pasta and their penne is my favorite. It is not too stiff, it is not too mushy, it is just right. It holds up well and cooks more quickly than some other brands."
2,Running out of good stuff...,"Capitol Records and the Beach Boys have made a cottage industry out of the CD reissue - or more specifically, the inclusion of previously unreleased material on CD reissues. It is a testament to the group's vocal talent and Brian Wilson's unique creativity that through multiple album reissues and boxed sets, right up through 1999's ""Endless Harmony"", they never ran out of worthy material. Consider the bottom of the barrel to have now been struck. Honestly, how many versions of ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" and ""Surfin' USA"" do I really need to own? It's unlikely that even the most diehard Beach Boys fan will find themselves listening to this more than once or twice. The only thing of real interest here is the ""Vegetables"" section. Methinks Beach Boys fans should save their dollars for the long promised, patiently awaited _Smile_ box (which, according to EMI A&R man Ron Furmanek, has been finished and in the can for four-plus years now...)."
5,Wonderful,"Brian Wilson's work during this period was so wonderful that you just want to go back to the kitchen and lick the pan. The man just could not do anything wrong...it's amazing that there was this much more compelling material in the vaults after they've been visited so much. The version of ""Breakaway"" here may be the definitive one for me now. Kudos to Capitol- let's hope they do it again, and soon."
1,Save your money,"Save your money. Nothing these books tell you (which you can get off the net) will save you money--and the information will get you into trouble besides.The real professionals don't need books. The rest of us need to invest our money wisely, and not send it to Adam Starchild."
3,Pales in comparison to Ritual,"Let me say that I think Ritual de lo Habitual is my favorite CD in my entire collection. Nothing's Shocking just doesn't have that much on it. Although not a bad CD, it has 3 or so good songs. Ritual has 9, all 9, without reservation. If you own Ritual and are looking for more of the same, you won't find much here, as you will be shocked to find out."
5,A true experience.,"This album is simply a masterpiece. You want to get away for a while? I mean far, far away? Just listen to ""Summer Time Rolls"" & ""Mountain Song"" with the eyes closed and you may not come back."
1,gross,"Well, it does after all come from the worst music era out there (late 80's). Jane's Addiction is really boring at this point, their only good old song was ""Been Caught Stealing"", Oh my gosh if I hear ""Jane Says"" one more time I will go insane. That has to be the worst song ever released. Especially as a hit, for goodness sake. Anyway, don't buy this, Ritual De LO Habitual, the self-titled or Kettle's Whistle. ""Strays"" was their only good release, and vastly underappreciated at that (the opening track comes from a tire commercial).But anyway, I hated this CD and it should not be purchased."
5,would recommend,I bought this exhaust for my ZX2. Amazon was the lowest price and with free shipping it cant be beat. Had my old exhaust off and the new one installed in less then 2 hours. The hangers were in the right spot and everything lined up just fine. I would recommend this product.
5,Skeleton watch,"Hi hi,perfect skeleton watch. Stuhrling is good brand. Good quality, on time delivey."
2,Good espresso but flawed design,"This is my second machine in ~1 month, the first was returned because the overflow tray started to jam. The second machine now has the same problem. As mentioned in other reviews, this tray fills up very fast. There's a nozzle that dispenses hot water directly into the tray towards the back of the machine (not sure why). I think what is happening is that the hot water bows the plastic tray slightly but enough to cause jamming. By jamming, I mean I have to pull so hard to slide the tray out that I'm afraid I'll break it. This is not just a minor annoyance since you'll have to turn the whole machine upside down in the sink to empty the tray. Hopefully, my experiences were the exception and not the rule, or this problem can be avoided by emtying out the tray more frequently. Me personally, I expect a machine to be idiot-proof. Thankfully I bought mine at Bloomingdale's so returning it will be easy. I would not recommend ordering this machine online."
1,Bush Haters Will Love it.,"Rich spends page after page 'documenting' opinion, innuendo, and outright laws to prove his point, which is that he thinks Bush and Cheney are both Satan. It almost sounds like the book was really written by Hugo Chaves and Ahmmanawhackjob from Iran.Anyone who's read Rich's column knows that his hatred of Bush knows no bounds. That hatred seems to coexist with his hatred for the truth as well."
2,The Greatest Story Ever SOLD,"I got this book, ""The Greatest Story Ever SOLD"" , for my ex-husband and don't know if he even read it, so I don't know how to rate it."
1,Yet Another Left Wing New Media Traitor of the YSA,More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations.
4,Just as I thought...,"If one can believe all the details in this book, it is just as I thought. We have been lied to all the time. Although the print is quite small, it is an interesting read. It is well-documented with references on all pages. He sometimes uses words that I have never even heard before and have to look them up in the dictionary, but when he is off and running on a story, it goes fast! I recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered about whether or not we are getting the real story on ""news"" coming out of the White House."
3,you've got to hear the ballads on this cd,"Sure, the faster songs are good - but for someone age 14 or 15 to sing ballads so well,...it's just amazing! The best songs are: I Miss You, Say Goodbye, If I Were You, Maybe Tonight"
3,Solid album by Snypaz,"Yes,it could have been better(they have the talent), but still a pretty good album by the snypaz. The album had nice production and raps,with a few weak points. Standout tracks included U Dont Wanna Blaze,Kill-steal-will,playa like me,and searchin(Traxster produced this one).I would give it 4 stars, but there are too many other good midwest cds out there that i would put ahead of this..saying that, it's still a good album, and a worthy buy."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a terrific training treat. It smells absolutely wonderful, is not greasy, can be cut into small pieces and my dog LOVES it! She'll perform every trick she knows just to get a morsel of it. When I take her for a walk and carry the treats in my pocket, I have her full attention. Highly recommended!"
5,Great as food or as a treat!,"I first came across the Natural Balance dog food rolls while in obedience class with my first dog. She could be picky about the treats, but a few weeks into class one of the trainers tried giving a small piece of roll to her. She LOVED it and would do ANYTHING for it! After that I immediately went out and bought one, and have used it to help train my second dog, too. The best way for using it as a treat is to cut off a small slice (maybe a quarter-inch thick), then cut that into small squares to make them bite size. Perfect for dog training!Another way I use it now is with the dog food. I don't use it as a straight feed for my dogs because it would cost me too much. I found what works great is adding it to their dry food. I feed my dogs Natural Balance Ultra Premium Dog Food and I use a grater/shredder and shred some of the roll and mix it in with their food. Even the pickiest of eaters will probably eat their food then."
2,They NEVER flatten out,"I still use these periodically, but they are a real pain. They come up rolled up, and after almost a year, the plastic still have never relaxed to lie flat."
3,Decent product,"Pros: lightweight, durable, flexible, avoids cross contamination, low costCon: The flatness of the mats will let any juices from the food you are cutting run all over the counter."
4,FINALLY a nice cutting board set that didn't break the bank!,"I have hunted all over locally for a set of flexible cutting boards to use OVER my glass cutting boards. There was nothing local, not even Walmart had anything. Than I found these and WOW they are just what I was looking for! I have been using them for a few weeks now and I have noticed a few scratches in the veggie board which is the one I use the most, but they are not deep at all. I know that they say they are dishwasher safe but I saw several reviews on this site and other sites saying that they tend to curl when washed in the dishwasher so I have been washing them by hand. I also use Clorox Anywhere on them after washing, just to be sure they are clean. The small white ones are great for cutting onions on, because than I can just flex it and put it in the bowl.I recommend these to keep things safe and clean!"
4,Muy utiles,"Mi hermana me las encargo de Mexico y esta encantada con ellas!Se ven de buena calidad y bonitos colores. Muy duraderas, vienen en varios colores designados para cortar cada tipo de comida, sin preocuparse de transmitir bacterias usando solo una. Asi que hay para cortar: pescado, pollo, verduras, etc."
5,Great purchase for chopping and flexibility and sanitation,"You can chop on these then bend them to pour into whatever dish you're making. Plus, the multiple set allows you to chop veggies, meat, chocolate, etc. and not have to clean or worry about cross contamination. They easily fit into the dishwasher. Best purchase for the kitchen."
1,They curve!!,These curve so badly that they are nearly impossible to use. I've never had such bad boards. Hubby wants to throw them away and buy new ones...that's how bad they are!
1,Cutting boards,The mats are very difficult to actually use. The mats curl down on the ends; this does not improve with use. I do like the food designations on the mats & colors. These are cutting board sets.
2,"Good idea, bad product","I bought these cutting mats because they are color-coded, flexible & easy to store. These mats arrived curled. Manufacturer states that these mats are dishwasher safe so I thought maybe the heat from the dishwasher would relax them but they came out even more curled & permanently curled after the first wash. I rarely use them due to the hazzards of cutting items on a curled surface. I do not recommend this product."
3,Cheap design and hard to pump,"Like another reviewer, I've found the pump is poorly made with cheap materials. When pumping my bike tires, there is resistance as I push down, and you really have to put in a lot of effort to get that air into the tire. A kid definitely would have trouble using the pump, and may even hurt him or herself with the effort required. This is one case where old school does not mean better. I've had the pump for a few months now, and it does what it's supposed to, but I would suggest going with another product that is safer to use and doesn't require as much effort."
1,Don't buy this~!!!,"I bought this one to get air to sports balls. When I was using it at second time, the handle was broken. Don't waste your money."
3,Italian flummery,"Ursula is very easy on the eye,wooden in acting...the chimpanzee stole the show...sometimes you just need to kick back and put your mind in neutral and chill out...this is a good movie for it...it doesn't strain the brain even if the dubbing is somewhat slipshod"
2,Fold up shelf,"I don't really like this shelf because the shelves aren't deep enough and long enough for what I need. I don't have any furniture what-so-ever so I was hoping this would be able to hold all of my clothes comfortably. But, they don't. I don't have that many clothes, they only fit about 2-3 pairs of pants in each shelf if your lucky, and that was when they were rolled up."
1,shot in the dark/ zero quality control/Junk!!!,"I wanted a new pair (24"" and 48"")levels for work. My Craftsman finally got knocked out of true by the damn young ""kids"" at work who think nothing of using them for pry bars.(lol) It(the craftsman) gave me 18+years of good service under my care. The 24"" Stanley Fat Max Extreme arrived and the center vial was 60-70% smudged with epoxy making it impossible to read from one side. Quality control is non-exixtant on these cheap imports. The 48"" Stanley FatMax Extreme I bought along with this had a 3/16"" tapered metal burr left from the stamping/machineing process where the center vial is epoxied in. it prevented the vial cover from fitting in the body of the level. the burr had a good coat of paint over it otherwise it would have sliced me open. Removing it would have left a hole in the body of the level. Junk!!!!!!!! Mite I suggest a German made product. I wonder if any good tools are made in America anymore. They used to be well made but who knows now????"
1,fun while it lasted,"My 5 year old son was very excited to get his own booklight, since I have my own (different) one that I use all the time. After one week of use, a screw that holds the joint together fell out or broke, and also two tiny pieces that must have been held in place by the screw fell out, one of them broken, so we can't really open and close the booklight anymore (the light is working fine). My adult booklight that I use cost half what this one does and is much sturdier. My son was really, really disappointed that it broke. He was treating it very carefully and very rarely breaks anything. Oh, well! We'll see if the manufacturer (I just emailed them) gives us some decent service (i.e. a replacement, which may or may not be very worthwhile)."
4,Pewter Spiral Shell necklace,"This is a very nice necklace. I don't like the cord it came on because the knots fall right to the side of my neck and show. I am planning on buying a different cord to hang it from. Otherwise, I liked this item and will wear it often."
1,Kodak Batteris,Did not fit my camera even though my Easy share Kodak camera was listed. Very disapointing. Will not take the risk in the future. Better to pay more at the drug store where returns are easier.
2,insanely expensive!,I have this battery pack the exact one and paid $15 dollars for it how do they get away with charging this kind of insane price?
1,Be careful if you send it back,"The product worked only because it was charged by the factory. It would not recharge using the kodak ni-mh charger I already had. I contacted the seller and while they agreed to refund my purchase of a defective battery (since it would not recharge), they deducted a six dollar restocking fee which is inappropriate. Be careful whom you buy from. Since Amazon does screen their sellers very well, this came as quite a shock to me when I reviewed the e-mail confirmation.Check out the TechFuel line for their version of a rechargable KAA2HR battery. I have successfully purchased and charged one of their batteries as of this review. I will update it if their battery shows any flaws. Their charger BTW includes a plug in for the car so if you have to travel it can charge while you drive. I love Kodak but I will not be clicking ""buy"" if the seller is Richard's superstore."
1,Doesn't fit my camera,"I bought this battery off Amazon because all the sellers listed it would work with my new Z1485 IS camera, but the battery doesn't even fit! The way they packaged it together, the excess plastic inhibits movement into the battery chamber, and it's a total waste because I bought the charger too. Disgusted."
5,jeep starter,"I just order this part , and if is as good as the information they provided with it, it will be great. You can't buy new items with a 2 year warranty. will let you know more when I get the item."
5,Excellent!,I had read about this film in the LA Weekly years ago but never got around to seeing it. I'm so glad I eventually checked it out. This movie is soul cleansing.
2,Good read aloud but teh author has completely copied the story,"Good book with simple story line that kids really enjoy. Good read aloud book for teachers in grades K-2. Only problem is that Ms. Galloway has totally ripped off another author names Andrew Clements, a famous name in children's literature. The book is a carbon copy of Big Al and Galloway should be held in contempt for a brazen steal of an idea."
5,Very Good,"Another very Good album from Mike Oldfield The Cd only contain Guitarssounds... and Guitars is just the instrument which Mike really know how to handle... Result : There is a lot of soul in this one... If you like instrumental Guitarmusic, you' ll love this one..."
3,Poor quality control,"I ordered 5 boxes of these CD-RWs. The first box had 3 damaged discs -- when I tried to format them before using them for a backup, I got a message ""Damaged or defective area on disc."" When I looked at them I could see many scratches on the shiny side (not all in the same place) on the discs that got this error message.On the positive side, the undamaged discs work fine, and the slim jewel cases do save space."
1,Memorex CD-RW JUNK!,I bought 25 from Wal-Mart. Couldn't write to them or nothing. Using a Dell 8250. Taking them back. Best to stick w/CD-R's anyway.
1,Sadly these Memorex CD-RW discs are useless,"Bought a box of 10 a few months ago, but they refused to work in both of my burners. Could not successfully write an iso image to them nor could I format with Drag-to-Disc. I spoke to Memorex, they sent me replacements in the mail. They still refused to work!! They ended up sending me another box, but this time they sent me Ultra Speed discs, still no luck!! Unbelievable. They finally refunded my money. Stay away from these discs until they get this mess straightened out!"
1,bring Ben back please,"I emplore CBS to bring Ben back to its broadcasts so he won't have time to write any more books. This is about as exciting as English food. If you want to read or send your favorite golfer some reading materials there are a lot of other good ones available such as The Masters, A GOOD WALK SPOILED & THE MAJORS. Leave this one alone."
3,Bit of an ego,"Provider service was excellent for this book, but content was only OK. In my opinion, Ben Wright's ego showed a little too often."
5,Gotta love Webster!!!!,I am waiting in anticipation for the rest of the seasons to become available. That's all I have to say!
1,Not the right item,"This posting is wrong! If your looking for Rock N Roll documentary this is not it. Save your money and keep looking! If your looking for Rock N Roll Circus, wrong posting, but the right pics. The seller needs to get a clue."
3,"Didn't live up to ""Undead & Unwed"" but what could?","I was very much looking forward to this one because Undead & Unwed hit all of the right notes for me. Unfortunately, for the most part, I was seriously disappointed. Nothing much at all seemed to be happening besides lots of quips being thrown about. Sadly, they lacked the bite and fun of the 1st book or maybe I'm just a complete crab. Also, the sexual tension, which was so much a part of book #1, seems to be nearly non-existent here :(Eventually things picked up and this was an amusing enough read but it did not live up to the promise and originality of Undead & Unwed. Still, I like Davidson's sass and will read the next in the series."
3,"A good, if not great, follow up","Book 1 in the Queen Betsy series, ""Undead and Unwed,"" was thoroughly hysterical. Book 2 doesn't achieve the same level of laugh-out-loud hilarity, but it's still a good follow-up and fun read. I'm looking forward to reading the third book, though with perhaps slightly less enthusiasm than I had for the second book. Although the novelty of the Betsy Taylor story has worn off slightly in ""Undead and Unemployed,"" the final chapter (not the Epilogue, but the one preceding it), had me bursting out laughing as did most of the first book. By no means is this a ""can't miss"" book--and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't read book one--but for those who enjoyed the first book in the series, I'd recommend this second one."
5,Definitely a great addition to the series,Mary Janice Davidson brings a refreshing sense of humor to this series and genre. I enjoyed the first book and this second one didn't disappoint. There is more character development and the plot thickens...Enjoy!
5,LAUGHED OUT LOUD!!!,"UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED IS THE SEQUL TO UNDEAD AND UNWED. I LOVE MARYJANICE DAVIDSON'S UNDEAD SERIES. THIS ONE MADE ME LAUGH MY B-U-T-T OFF (I wish:). I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE OVER A BOOK. SO, IF YOU LOVED READING UNDEAD AND UNWED YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS ONE MORE. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE."
2,Not as good as first novel,"I read Undead and Unwed and was anxious to read this novel, the second in the series. I was disappointed. Elizabeth has become an annoying character. Her immaturity made me wish I could slap her hard. I also agreed with the editor that more Sinclair was needed. I was overall disappointed."
2,Will Betsy grow up?,"In the first book of the series, Undead and Unwed, the main character Betsy had a flippant, irreverent attitude that made sense, considering her rejection of becoming the queen of the vampires. The first book was funny and enjoyable, which was why I got the second book, Undead and Unemployed. When is Betsy going to grow up? Her airheaded antics suggest someone with serious developmental issues. Her sarcastic attitude just isn't very funny anymore. She's had three months to get used to being a vampire (and her crime fighting suggests that she's putting her new skills to good use), but her attitude towards Sinclair and the whole vampire crowd is very off-putting. And what's up with her insistence in the Epilogue about being poor--I thought she had the wealth of three dead vampires. Did the author make a mistake? In summary, I was hoping for some character development, but I was disappointed."
2,Too General,"If you don't know anything about EMT work, this book may be helpful to you. I am taking classes as an EMT and it didn't help me at all. In most chapters you can practically substitute any career for the word EMT and the book would still make sense(excluding the chapters ""Why become an EMT"" and ""All About EMT's""). If you're not familair with EMT work and have no idea how to get into the field, this book may be a good choice. For the most part the information in this book is too general for someone who's already on the path to becoming an EMT."
4,SICK BASS-LINE,"WHEN I HEARD THIS SONG I WAS BOUNCIN' THE CHORUS WAS SICK, ""LOVELY DAY, LOVELY DAY!"" VERY NICE BY ANT BANKZ AND T.W.D.Y. ONLY THING IS I'M ONLY GONNA GET THIS SONG NOT THE ALBUM. PEACE TO DA GODZ"
3,Not as good as the original,"It's a catchy song, but if you want the real thing check out ""Lovely Day"" by Bill Withers."
5,TOP SONG OF THE YEAR,"This makes you want to jump up and dance. It's beat just runs through your body. The song is so original. Not like alot of rappers out there that stay with the same style. If I could rate this higher than 5 stars, I would rate it a 10."
4,My own Review,This is not one of our best cd's but I hope y'all like it! PS: if you guys wanna email me email justin_t@1nsyncfan.com
2,Breadth rather than depth,"I thought I wasted money on this book. I just couldn't tell online which ""complete cat guide"" was really complete, and I went by the reputation of the Cornell Feline health care center (which I still think is excellent). However, I was disappointed because the book comprises of independent chapters authored by different experts. As a result, the chapters repeated themselves slightly (because the authors wrote independent of each other)and within each chapter, the authors did not delve deep enough into each subject. The tone was not sympathetic to a layman pet owner, but curiously neither was it technical enough for a practising veterinarian -- I think the editors just didn't do a good job. The coverage is broad and basic -- good for a first time cat owner, but certainly you need another book to supplement it. I am still shopping for a more comprehensive detailed book for domestic cat care."
2,More of a reference book for a vet,"I just purchased this book and was disappointed. It is really more for a reference book that a vet might have or if your cat has already been diagnosed, you could look up the diseases to get a bit more of an understanding. If you are looking for a book on how to treat and understand your sick cat, this is not the book for you.For instance, there is one reference if you try to look up HAIRBALL, and it tells you nothing...no information you could actually use. Basically, it's a dictionary and nothing more.I do not recommend this book."
1,This book is just utter rubbish.....,That is the most positive thing I could possibly say about it. It's actually quite laughable. I find it incomprehensible that anyone could actually buy into this.
1,"Sad day when venom, not intellect determines GOP stardom","I can't say I'm a huge defender of Bill Clinton's conduct in office,but this book serves mostly to highlight the current right-wingculture in which vitriol and hate-infused rhetoric are the onlyessentials needed when applying for a slot as a G.O.P. pundit.AnnCoulter's book is one of the foremost examples of this trend --Using speculation, rumor and innuendo much more than solid researchand fact, she does a dubious hatchet job indeed. Not that there isnot room for very solid criticism of the Clinton Administration, but amore valid review would come from someone like William Safire, who canstill argue from the conservative side without appearing to auditionas a writer for pro wrestling broadcasts. (...)"
1,More shrill clap-trap from everybody's favorite harpy,"what a waste of wood. even scarier is some of the other feedback on this site. how can people believe this swill?my favorite posts: the ones in which the reader is just bowled over by coulter's acumen at marshalling the facts. but I guess there's never been a shortage of pin-headed chumps willing to hang their blind rage on the thinnest of manufactured evidence.coulter's descended from a venerable line of charlatans who've argued everything from the relationship b/t the smallness of negro brain pans and their intelligence, to the holocaust as the work of fevered jewish hysterics. think of coulter's oeuvre as political junk science."
5,Ann has answered all the questions of costitutionality.,"This book is interesting and provides the common reader with the knowledge to argue with Clinton supporters who are unwilling to open their eyes to the travesties that occurred in the White House; furthermore it clearly shows that the president should be held liable for his illegal actions. Ann Coulter, I am glad someone in this world feels as much pain as I do and support you 100%. I studied Constitututional Law in college, and can find nowhere that a President who lied to a Federal Grand Jury shouldn't be impeached. If it was one of us committing those acts, we would have been incarcerated. Everyone, including and especially the president are subjects to the constitution. Thank you Ann Coulter for writing this book"
1,Let me Tell You How Bad This Book Is...,I've seen parrots reject pages from this woman's book as cage lining. Ann Coulter's writing style is mediocrity personified. She says nothing that you wouldn't already know if you picked up a newspaper. There are better uses for paper than this.
3,Ann's First Book Digs Deep Into the Clintons,"Bottom Line: A Harsh and Detailed Indictment of President Clinton's BehaviorWhat You Will Learn: Too much about the President's personal behavior and a lot about the early mistakes made by the Clinton's. To me the interesting question, when reading the details of Whitewater, Filegate and the Lewinsky Affairs, is what Mrs. Clinton learned from these painful experiences. My bet is a lot - and that these rookie mistakes and lapses won't be repeated if there is a second Clinton Presidency.Parting Shot: Have to give Anne her due, she is a relentless researcher and a skilled writer - this is one side of the story, bluntly told."
1,Ann Ann Ann,"Ann Coulter's 15 minutes were up a long time ago. The author should be one of the targets for the war on terror. Bill Clinton is certainly no saint, but when you look at what sits in the Oval Office today, it certainly puts Bill Clinton's transgressions into their proper perspective. And I can guarantee that if Bill Clinton had failed to file documents with the SEC after selling off his shares of stock in the oil company he was with, the man would have been put in prison. Such double standards. As you can see, I have a great number of issues with George Bush and I could write a book in the same vein that Ann Coulter wrote about Bill Clinton and it would be just as good. Maybe even better. Plus, I too am a tall bonde woman with a law degree. Come to think of it, I think I will start exaggerating my book right now. Sorry. Gotta go!"
1,Like a Vulture,"This book is a gluttonous display on Ann's part. How she took pleasure at Clinton's mistakes. She exagerated them and inserted her own brand of truth whenever necessary. I was not pleased that Clinton made a mockery of our judicial system, but let's face facts his lies didn't kill people. Compared to Bush (who Ann very much supports) Clinton's actions seem almost silly. Clinton cared about people and made efforts to build them up while the author of this book and our current president work to divide us."
1,Psychotic blonde seeks attention!,Get this. It's not in large type to make it easier to read. It's because it's utterly stupid. But the money to made is made by pandering to angry dysfunctional people. And they do have trouble reading.
5,Terrific Pictures,I bought this book before going to Acadia Natl Park. It was incredibly helpful. Our exploration of the Park Loop Road was more interesting because of all the helpful info in this book. Loved the pictures. Very representative of the actual places.
5,Gorgeous photographs,"good illustrations -- likable narrator -- wonderful photo of ACTUAL FROSTBITE in color. Yuck.This makes Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay everyday names again -- very well written.My kids love disasters -- this book is great. Learn some mountaineering words -- col, couloir, crampon, crevasse, cwm..."
1,Can you believe that?? illuminator is a scam,"Bought it from Amazon seller.I wasn't expecting anything great for 15$.. I bought it only because i need a cronograph for the gym.. But at least, i was expecting a decent illuminator feature (they call it ""LED light with afterglow"") and i can tell you, it is just a simple light like old watches. i will upload some pictures for costumers can judge that."
1,Poor quality bluetooth technology,"I am not 100% satisfied with the product that I purchased. Plantronics Explorer 320 Bluetooth Headset is reasonablly priced but the product itself is not a stellar product. Ever since i've owned the bluetooth wireless device I have had many calls dropped due to weak signals and static. I also have a big problem with the comfort of the device on your ear lobe. Wearing the product for more than 3 hour intervals will leave your ear's sore because of the insertable earpiece.Overall, the product is not something to rave about or invest money in. I would advise potential customers to look at other types of Bluetooth devices instead of Plantronic's bluetooth devices."
2,Believe the negative reviews. Don't waste yer money on this one.,"I just bought it and returned it after a few hours. Everything people have written about is true:Pros:- Pretty lightweight.Cons:- Static.- Needs line of sight (who ever heard of that in a Bluetooth device??)- Earpiece hurts inner ear.- Less than 5 feet of workable range.It may be cheap, but if it doesn't do the work it's supposed to what use is spending even $26 for it. Might as well add a $20 and get the 510 headset. Thats what I'm planning to do."
4,Alright headset,"This is a good headset, works fine... unless you are in another room or if you turn a certin way and something is blocking the connection then it gets bad but thats ok. Its good other than that."
3,"Good value for price, but...","ProsSnug, comfortable fitLightweightLong battery lifeDecent sound qualityInexpensiveConHissing background noise can be annoying at higher volumesBarebones styling"
2,Poor reception,"I am returning this headset. The main problem is that the sound quality is terrible unless you have your phone in your hand and hold it at chest level or higher. It was ridiculous. If the phone was any more than 3 feet from the headset the reception was terrible. At 5 feet I couldn't hear anything and the person on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me. It says this should work at 30'. Hardly!Everything else about this headset is fine. It is comfortable, light weight, and pairs easily with my phone (LG PM325)."
2,Great if you Like Static,This is my first bluetooth headset and I am using it with a Treo 650. The sound quality is terrible because of the amount of static. I have taken to holding my Treo up and close to the headset to get a clear sound. I wouldn't recommend this because of the problem with static. I am planning on buying a different headset because this is really not useable.
1,Unpleasant First Timer,"This product worked ok for the first month but the battery died out and would light up but never work again. Ok to purchase for one months use but if looking for long-term use, buy something more expensive or another brand. Reconsider carefully..."
2,you get what you pay for...,"Don't purchase. Pay the extra 10 and get the motorola. I bought 2. There is a lot of ""back ground"" noise. Hard to understand incoming and outgoing voices. We bought this after a walmart associate said it was better or as good of quality as the motorola...don't do it."
4,Plantronics Explorer 320 bluetooth,"This is the 1st bluetooth that I have owned. It is a good tool and I find it to be very useful. I do not believe in holding a phone while driving. This enables me to have quick conversations if the need arises when I am on the road.It tends to beep intermittantly while on and I,m not quite sure if it is a call coming in or just an alert that the device is still on.The instructions that come with the device are not very clear.I do like it. Maybe after using it more fequently I will become more comfortable with it."
2,Missing instructions and no warranty card,"The Explorer 320 is and excellent product: inexpensive, high quality, and easy to use. This is the second one I've had. Somebody stepped on the first one. Unfortunately, it was shipped without any enclosed operating instructions or a warranty card. Fortunately, I still had the operating instructions from the other one I had, and I decided to take a chance on not sending in a warranty. But, if I hadn't had the instructions, it would have been impossible to set the thing up."
3,Adequate headset,The product is comfortable to wear and the button for volume and answering is very intuitive.Sound quality is not great
4,Great headset for the money,"This headset is easy to use, has excellent sound quality, stays in my ear, and was simple to pair with my phone. My only complaint: weird connection with the charger cord. This is a big improvement over my previous (much more expensive) Jabra headset, which had lots of bells and whistles, but poor sound, wouldn't stay in my ear, and was difficult to pair with the phone."
4,The Flash,"I enjoyed the show when it was on television and could not wait to purchase it. The quality of this dvd is good. I have to say ""another good purchase""."
1,Should be called Mr. Freeze!!!,"After reading reports on at least 4 major dvd message boards I decided to pop my disc one in to test it out. Same as hundres of others (& those are just the ones who've posted). Just as the pilot episode gets to the end it starts to skip & eventually freezes up. It appears to be a big error in the disc itself as tons of different dvd players, computers, etc... report the same thing. Looks like Warner Brothers will probably have to repress the first disc & have a tradein program. Not every copy is showing this glitch, a few have reported no problems. But, that could be the player & what happens if your next player shows the glitch up even if it plays fine now? WB needs to redo disc one."
3,"Great show, deserves way better...","Wow I remember loving this show when it was on as a kid (though due to scheduling I don't think I saw more than 8 episodes). I'm glad to finally see it on DVD, though extremely disappointed in Warner Bros. care with the set. I (like many others) had problems with the pilot skipping and freezing. I returned my set to amazon, and bought another from Best Buy. The new set seems to be fine. I have a feeling this defect may have been only with the first batch, still it's unexcusable. Also, the picture and audio quality could have been touched up a little. It is these things that made me give the rating, the show itself is great but it is a shame WB didn't care more for this set. Shame on them..."
2,For kids only,"Okay, I only spent $23 on this (clearance at CVS), so I cannot complain too much. The picture quality suffers under all but the best lighting conditions. Putting some kind of filter over the strobe (I used Scotch tape and copy paper) produced some acceptable flash pix, but most of the objects in the center of the photo were washed out. The fun comes when you hand it to your seven year old taking little video clips (with sound at 10 fps). Shutter lag is substantial. None of my photos are sharp, and the colors can only be made pleasing by correcting in Photoshop. The LCD is small but reasonable. Battery life is okay. The pictures simply cannot compare to my Olympus D550, which is FAR superior with the same number of pixels."
5,Beautiful plush!,"The Cuddlekins 30"" line are extremely beautiful, soft, large, cushy, and just wonderful for any animal lover or stuffed animal lover. I've bought a few for my nieces, nephews, and my own son and can't wait to give them at their birthdays!! The black bear is soft as butter (softest of all the ones I've received :)*They also must have changed the claws, the one I got just a few days ago had claws made out of pieces of a pliable fabric."
1,Smells HORRIBLE,"I rarely leave Amazon reviews but I had to chime in to agree with the 2-star review: this lotion smells nothing like honey or orange and everything like plastic and chemicals. So disgusting that after putting it on my arms and legs and letting it sit for a few minutes, I had to get up and go take a shower to get it the heck off of me. My husband admitted he hated it as much as I did. Seriously gross.I gather from all the positive reviews that perhaps it's one of those lotions you either love or hate the scent of... but just be forewarned that, like me, you may be in the latter group. What a waste of $7."
4,Works with iPod Touch,Just got this today. And it works fine with the iPod Touch. Not the greatest sound quality but fine in the car. I use it in International mode to get the 87.9 frequency. I like the fact it's a combination charger and FM transmitter.
4,Best Griffin FM transmitter till date,"I bought this product after trying 2,3 other griffin FM transmitters and I found it to be the best. Very clear signal , rarely I found any disturbance. Sound is slow but it is fine for me , I can manage. The only bad part of the product is autocharging, your IPod will be kept on charging whenever you want to use this transmitter which is never recommended from Apple. But still it is ok ."
3,Stay on channel,"I like the fact that this unit charges the iPod while you're driving. I needed that. What I don't like is the fact that every time you turn the car off you have to reset the station on the iTrip. The presets work but I wish it stayed on the channel it was on when you turned it off. Reception is fair. I live in Denver and there are a lot of radio stations taking up air space. Driving from South Denver to North Denver, I have to change the station once. Not a big deal. Overall, I think it is worth the price tag."
4,Does not charge iPod touch 2nd Gen!,"I was excited to get this because I could charge my iPod and listen to it at the same time! I plugged it into my car and the first thing it said was that the charger was not compatible... I can still listen to my iPod, but it will not charge simultaneously, I can only charge OR listen to it."
4,good transmitter,"Road works very well, good sound and is not interrupted the transmission.in the city instead interference occurs most oftenhowever, recommend the product"
4,Very good product for the price,"Obviously this is not top of the line stuff but it's not trying to be, the sound quality was at least what I had hoped for (use google to find out about the international mode, I live in Houston where there are tons of radio stations and I don't know if this would have worked well without it). If playing your ipod at fm radio quality for very little money appeals to you then I recommend this product."
4,driving and rockin,"I like it. Sometimes it picks up spots around new york city where all i hear is static, but sounds great directly in the city and further outside. Easy enough to use and you dont need to put any software on your ipod like the old ones"
4,*****Great quality transmitter*****,"I've been using the Griffin iTrip for about 2 months now that I ordered on Amazon. It was brand new in package and came w/ all instructions. So far, it is very easy to use and works great. The only down fall (if you can call it one) is the volume. You really have to turn it up loud on your system to be able to hear it. Not a problem, until you're ready to listen to regular radio again! WOW~"
3,fuzzy- not worth the $$,All ipod adapter/transmitters have lower quality sound -- but this more expensive model with more choices for signal channel has even lower quality sound. My old adapter ($15) only had 3 channels but much better quality. The other issue is if you live in any metropolitan area there are not really any empty channels on FM. This unit is not strong enough to override even the weakest signal.
3,Works OK its not a HI FI product,"The i trip its OK it doesn't sound as it sounds on the I pod but does its work, you can hear what you got in you ipod."
3,Don't buy for your 4th Gen. Nano!!!,"The product worked fine for transmitting an FM signal to my radio, but it will not charge the 4th Gen. Nano, so I will have to get a different one. Nice, compact, easy to use."
5,Excelent,"Item works very well. I am able to drive all the way to the doctors listening to almost perfectly clear sound and then unplug my iPod and still have full battery life for those long long long long waits at the physicians office. Definatly worth the price on Amazon because if you try to buy this product from apple, Griffen, or any other retail store it goes for $80 or more!"
4,"Great seller, OK product","Seller was awesome... product came quickly and as promised. Product however is not as desirable as once thought. Not that great for trips, because you're constantly having to find a new channel that isn't plagued with a radio station. Plus, the transmitter doesn't go below 88.1FM... there are open stations below that, but I can't use them."
3,Buy it on sale,"This product does what it says it will - play your iPod through your car stereo while charging the batteries. As previous reviews mentioned, there is an audible hiss and the volume is very low which means cranking up the volume.Would I buy it again, no. However, I am going to try it in a different car and see if my opinion changes. At the very least, it's another charger."
4,Works great but sound quality just OK,"Easy to use, works just fine in three different cars. I bought for myself but gave it to my college daughter who uses it on her weekend commutes. Both of us found the audio was a bit washed out, somewhat mushy overall--not nearly as clear as a good sounding FM station. I adjusted the equilaizer to max high end sound which helped some.Great value as bought on Amazon for $38. Looking for another better sounding for my TL, which has limited access to the lighter socket. We've had it 4 weeks now and no problems."
3,"Clean sound, but may not charge your Nano","This device can get you a very clean sound on your car stereo, much better than the Belkin that my daughter uses. BUT, it will not charge my Nano 4g. I checked with Griffin customer service and they confirmed that this version of the product will not charge Nano 4g. Newer versions have the same product name, so the only way to tell if you have the correct version is color - the black one is the older one. For cleanest signal, switch to international mode (hold down the preset for about 10 seconds to find it), tune the Griffin and your radio to 87.9. No American radio stations on that frequency, so no interference. Worth the price even without the charging function."
1,an iPod charger that won't charge your iPod,"The transmitter part of this device worked fine. I had clear transmission and was able to hear my iPod content fine. Until its battery died. I don't know if it was my iPod, or what, but when I tried to charge it, I got a ""device not supported"" message on my iPod. I know I was getting juice, or the device does not transmit. I was sorry I didn't check the charging bit until I was already into a three day road trip through Arkansas and Texas."
3,It's the only one that works,"After reading a few reviews I bought this Griffin iTrip and even thoughthe cable mess bothers me, at least I get pretty good sound around the South Bay area.Heading into LA it get a little worse. I tried out a couple of other systems and they justwouldn't work well at all."
4,It doesnt Charge My Ipod,HI everyone..can any tell me why this accessory Didnt Charge My Ipodthanx alot
4,Perfect for trips,"This is the kind of product that's perfect when you're triping, cause there are cleaner frequencies, so the sound quality is pretty good!"
4,Itrip auto FM transmitter,"It's a good product, the sound could be better but i think that it works perfectly."
2,Didn't Meet Expectations,"I would not recommend this product to anyone who is highly concerned with the sound quality put out by their audio devices.I've used this device in several cars with varying stereos, and the sound quality was noticably worse than FM radio in all of them. The signal the FM transmitter puts out is weak, and I had to fiddle around with its placement before I could hear anything.The only useful feature was the charger, and I use it frequently to charge my ipod on long trips.I've heard many simular complaints about this item from friends, and should have paid heed to them before purchasing this item. In my opinion, this item is not worth the $90 list price, and I wouldn't buy it again for $20. I've heard that the ipod FM tranmitter made by Monster is a good buy, so I suggest you check that one out."
4,The product is Just Okay! NOTHING MORE OR LESS!,The product is Just Okay! NOTHING MORE OR LESS! I used it a lot and it is just the same i only give it 4 stars because it is cheap and easy to use. But the quality is just the same as any other product. So i recommend this product to everyone because it is cheap and worth every penny you spend!
4,It Works,It's not the latest technology but it works well enough and the price was right. I get static in a big city but none in the burbs and out on the road where I spend most of my driving time. I'm satisfied with it.
3,Review,"This product is pretty good, the only thing tho is with traveling....signal becomes staticy and you have to change it. But other than that i love it!"
4,Depends on the car,"Works great- especially since I'm not just limited to 3 stations. I do get some static but it seems to be specific to my car, as when I used it my friends VW it was crystal clear."
3,Does not work with latest iPod nano (gen 4),This Griffin iTrip model does not work with the new iPod nano (gen 4). The sounds transmits but the iPod doesn't charge. It is easy to set up and the sound quality is good and steady.
4,Much Improved,"I bought this for my girlfriend because on a recent road trip, her ipod could only be played via her iTrip. The iTrip took battery power and gave you only one choice of a radio broadcast station. The iTrip Auto not only gives you a broadcast choice, it seems to broadcast better, thus much clearer music. Using the dock connector instead of the headphone jack also allows you to control the volume of the music solely from the radio controls in the car. On top of it all, it charges her ipod while she drives. She loves it and I would highly recommend it."
2,Mediocre - Hopefully it will be fine-tuned...,"Just like the MP3 players themselves were. I picked this up and don't really like it. If you live in a metropolitan area, or any place where there are loads of radio stations, it might be tough to find a good, clear frequency. And on top of that, they were a bit modest in saying that the signal used is weak - it seems near non-existent! The volume comes across low... except for when you hit a bad frequency patch.It does have a car charger, but I don't think it's worth it since you can also get one of those separately (along with a wall charger). I use the tape (that people used to use with CD players) instead of it, as even the sound quality in the tape is noticeably better to me, even with the mechanical noise. Hopefully in the future there will be better ways of integrating the players with cars. It's one thing to have sound quality that's a bit lagging, but it shouldn't be as noticeably poor as this."
2,"Plays well, but....","Following the suggestion to put it in international mode, the iphone plays very nicely through the radio. However, the iphone will not charge with this device so it only gets 2 starts."
2,Does NOT charge the iPod,"I'd give this product a 4 rating if it charged my iPods (2nd Gen iPod Touch and 4th Gen iPod Nano.) It plays just as advertised, but on a long trip, you'll need to unplug it and use a separate charger (No music while this is happening) :("
3,It should be called iMight....,"It is misleading to call it an iTrip when people will naturally draw the conclusion that it will charge your iPod. It does not support charging the 4TH GEN. NANO, and that's a major drawback.As other people on here have said, the car volume needs to be cranked higher than you ordinarily would for a radio station.Works fine, plug and play with the car radio. Minimum intuition required. The sound quality is ok, nothing great, but adequate. It's right at, or a notch below radio quality sound.3 Stars because it was cheap, and will do the job, just not a great solution. If you are really into music you will probably hate it. For the casual commuter, like me, who doesn't want to hear radio ADs for my 10 minute ride to work, it'll do."
1,Doesn't Seem to work with 1st Gen. iPod Nano,"When using the product, it would seem to only broadcast silence (only once heard a faint signal). Because it would knock out the static, it seems as though it is transmitting powerfully enough to reach the radio, isn't getting a loud enough signal from the iPod Nano (1G). It works perfectly with a 2nd Gen. iPod Nano and my new iPod Touch"
3,OK if you have no other choice,"My headunit doesn't have a tape player or aux in, so short of buying a new deck for the car, an FM transmitter was my only choice. Sound is mediocre and not very loud, but I guess you can't really expect much. The one thing that bugs me is that it doesn't save the setting, so every time I get in the car I have to adjust it back to the desired station.I'd only recommend this if you have no other method of listening to an ipod in the car. I'm probably going to go get a deck with an aux in, even though I installed my cd-changer a few months ago."
3,Adjustment problem.,Bought this to replace one I have that is becoming static. This one does not go to as to as low a radio station as first one which can be an issue for my best reception.
1,Poor product,"The sound quality is POOR. I have used transmitters before, but this one is so quiet that you have to turn your stereo up all the way to hear it and when you do that the sound is terrible. No matter what station or setting I have it on. I wish I had bought something different."
4,iTouch 2G and iPhone 3G compatible?,"I got this for my wife's car. She has an iTouch 3g and I read multiple reviews here that it would work to play audio but wouldn't charge. I was ok with that. But I found that I don't get audio when using the iTouch or iPhone, both continue to play the music through their internal speaker but doesn't put anything out through the transmitter. It works great with her older ipod Nano, plays music and charges.Can't understand why multiple others are able to use with itouch 2g for music but mine doesn't work. Could it be change in latest apple software version? If anyone was able to use and then stopped working after upgrading to latest software, pls post."
3,Great value for money,This is a very good product for your car and at a very reasonable price. I bought one for myself and then bought another one for a friend.
1,Does Not Charge iPhone,"The product charges and plays music with my iPod, but does NOT charge my iPhone. I need a product that both charges and plays music from my iPhone. That needs to be much clearer. Sending back."
2,Product Review,"I really did not like the product I purchased, the Griffin 9501-TRIPCBL iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black).The sound quality on the product was extremely poor. It sounded like a lot of static was coming through after trying on multiple stations. After a while I just got fed up with it and returned it for a full refund. I expected a lot better from this product and am very dissatisfied with it."
5,Great sound for the price.,"I have had trouble with so many other brands of iPod fm transmitters. The Griffin models, in particular this one, have been excellent. It's durable and it provides high-quality sound. I have had more expensive brand models that were horrible (Belkin). This is a great deal for a transmitter AND charger.If you live in a big city and have trouble finding good fm stations to use, try removing the arial from your vehicle. It means you won't be able to switch between the radio and your iPod, but your iPod transmitter will work much better."
1,Underpowered,"It's hard to understand how so many can find the iTrip so wonderful and some of us can find it so terrible. Either there is some significant variability in the manufacturing of the product or the location and design of the FM radio antenna in some cars is the problem. In any case, the signal from the unit I received was so weak that there was noticeable static regardless of where I placed the transmitter and how I positioned the cable. It didn't matter which station I chose - they were all bad. Worse, even when it was stationary the static hiss would increase, decrease, increase and so on. Also, as others have mentioned in reviews, the audio was considerably quieter than the car's built-in components.Nice idea, but I second the review that voted for a stronger transmission signal. With Amazon's easy return process, and given the ratio of positive to negative reviews, you may want to give it a shot. But it's a shot in the dark."
3,Understand the product,"Please understand that HOW these products work! Your transmitter sends out a signal from the unit, the car receives the signal from the ANTENNA! people talk about moving the ipod close to the radio unit, that's NOT the point! It's relative to the ANTENNA! That would be the stick that comes out on the roof, on the side to the back, or to the side to the front, depending on your vehicle, That's where you get the signal!"
4,"over all, it is pretty good","As for a transmitter, it works pretty well. However, it can not charge my ipod touch 2G. I'm not sure if it will damage my itouch if I connect them for a long time as the charging doesn't match. Probably I'll look for another one..."
4,"It worked!,..","So i was a little skeptical when it came to buying this product but to my surprised it worked well,..I was happy with the product."
1,extremely poor,The product that I purchased does not work well. It is very noisy so you can barely hear the music.
4,Works best in small cars!,"The iTrip works great in my small compact car, probably because the transmitter is closer to the antenna. I have driven all over California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, and only had to change the frequency once. Its easy to change to any frequency, and you even have 4 presets. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well in my larger vehicle, the antenna is a euro style and it is a little farther away, so that must be the reason why. I still love it and would recommend to those with smaller cars."
1,"Useless, non-refundable iPod FM transmitter","The unit offers no transmitting frequency on which interference does not intrude at unacceptable levels.Neither Amazon nor seller offer any compensation for a fool, such as I, who purchased the item in good faith.Griffin 9501-TRIPCBL iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black)"
2,"Static, lots of fidling and crank up the volume","We're not impressed with this transmitter.Ease of use - nope. You have to click through all stations to find the best. As you drive from one area to the next, that best station may need to be adjusted.Sound quality - nope. You have to crank up the iPod volume to the max in order to get any signal through. The iPod doesn't have the best amplifiers, so the fidelity suffers. You also have to crank up the stereo. Be careful when you switch to another source on the car stereo or plug in headphones to the iPod! Additionally, there's a significant amount of noise/static.Can't recommend this one."
2,There are better ones out there....,"I tried this product and had a fair bit of static, so I instead went to Best Buy and bought the DLO charger/transmitter, which works like a charm. It also costs a lot less...."
1,Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter,The iTrip doesn't work well in big cities. I bought mines without knowing and haven't really been using it since i get a lot of static.I guess i bought the older version of the iTrip since the newer ones help you scan for a clear frequency.It's actually pretty annoying having to scroll through your radio tuner to find a clear frequency.
3,I knew it wasn't going to be great,After reading as many reviews on this and other similar products I decided to limit my expectations. That was a good thing because most of the mediocre reviews were right. If you want hi fidelity you need to go another route. If you are happy with low fidelity then this will work well. It works well for listening to audio downloads. The product works as far as transmitting to your FM radio. I found no major flaws. It's just not the quality of audio that you would like to hear.
5,perfect for my needs,"It is grate to take the Ipod and just hook it inot the car without having to drag CDs with me. This item performs just as expected. I am please. I have plenty of places to place my unit in the car dash, but I can see where people would want a holder for the ipod."
4,great,"Works great, and so easy to use I didn't even have to read the instructions, and of course awesome price. Thanks Amazon!"
3,"Watchable, but could have been better.","Lucas, a good cop and family man, caught serial killer Max Jenke. But after the murderer is put to death, he comes back to plague Lucas through various halucinations. It turns out Jenke is now inhabiting some alternative world, can use electricity to his advantage.Henriksen is a strong, believable and sympathic character, and Jenke is a genuinely terrifying villain. Though this film contains truly dramatic and chilling moments, not to mention an atmospheric soundtrack, it is sadly let down by the fact that there are long periods in which nothing much happens. For example, the first five minutes or so seem to consist of aimless wandering through the killer's lair. Another problem is the dialogue. There are sometimes entire conversations which seem to be made up of little but f-words. Still, this is a watchable maniac-on-the-loose film."
3,THE HORROR SHOW,For everyone who thinks The Horror Show is the missing House 3 its not (1989) THE HORROR SHOW adopted the title House 3 in Australia and the UK so producers of House 3 retitled the film House IV to avoid confusion so House IV is actually House 3 just under a different title. The plot of the the Horror Show is about Detective Lucas McCarthy(Lance Henrickson)who has caught brutal serial killer Max Jenkie or Meat Cleaver Max (Brion James) exicuting Max was not the end of his reign of terror but actually gave him a new lease on life now he haunts the home of lucas and his family. Terry Alexander (Dawn of the Dead) plays Detective Casey and i actually ate at that restraunt in the movie when i was little. All in All this movie is pretty good i have not seen Wes Cravens Shocker yet but this film looks quite similer to it.
2,Gonzo gorefest,"Let's have some more blood in here...throw a couple of body parts on the stove... This is one of those great gonzo-killers-who-won't-die-even- when-they're-dead films that were so hot in the 80s. Don't get me wrong, I love watching the late, great Brion James chew scenery, and Lance Henriksen gives a good performance though he's somewhat hampered by the fact that he can't chew back since he's supposed to be a cop, a family man and reasonably sane. He still manages to give his characterization a real edginess. I mean, he gets to pull his own chest open in one scene. Can you get much edgier than that? Still, the dialogue rarely rises above the ""F--- you!"" ""Yeah, well, f--- you, too, f---er!"" level which is a shame."
3,Electrifying? Sadly not.,"Lance Henriksen plays a cop who arrests serial killer Max Jenke, but after the psychopath is put to death on the electric chair he comes back to haunt his nemesis through halucinations.Though this film is made watchable by a strong performance from Henriksen, a genuinely scarey killer and a good soundtrack, it is utterly let down by its slow pacing. It takes ages for the film to get going, and there are slabs of tedium later on. What also lowers the film is the unbelievably repetative use of f-words which becomes boring and shows a lack of imagination. Some chilling scenes can't save this Nightmare on Elm Street clone."
5,Carnival in Ibiza,"This is the best house cd that I own. Every song is good from begining to end. If you like your house music with a brazilian flavor, latin rhythms, afro cuban. then this cd is for you.I love it!"
3,"Ambient, Hawaiian Style - So Many Lounge Chairs, So Little Time","'Hawaii's Instrumental Favorites' is a somewhat enjoyable -11 track- collection of Hawaiian or Hawaii related melodies. This is pretty much nothing more than ambient faire for those slow, sweltering summer evenings around the pool with family and friends.Personal favorites: track 8- 'I Am Hawaii' (from Elmer Bernstein's '66 film soundtrack of 'Hawaii') and track 11- 'Hawaiian Love Song.'"
2,not as expected,"The watch was smaller than I had imagined it to be, and the diamonds were little chips which mad the watch look cheap to me."
1,Don't Waste Your Time And Money,"What a huge disappointment from Krups! We have had many fine Krups products over the years, but this is definitely not one of them. Our major problems were: the unit does not make warm coffee and does not keep it warm, even when preheating the cups as suggested; it constantly leaks into the drip tray, an average of 1/4 cup of liquid with each cup made; the foaming/froth attachment spits water into the milk, thereby diluting it and also cooling it down. And the company you receive it from tried to talk us out of sending it back when we called to learn their return policy. We still have to see if they will even accept the return as they strongly hinted they may not. Very, very disappointed, do not waste your time and money on this product."
2,Watered down....,"I've noticed that all of my drinks are watered down - from the steamers to the espresso. The steamer function is not that efficient - I have observed that although it spits out steam, it also constantly drips water. So, if you're wanting your milk to reach the 140-160 degree range like most baristas, then be prepared for watered down milk. I've tried different ways of doing it, different milk, etc., but it all tastes watered down. I've packed the coffee like crazy but it still comes out pretty weak. My friends have tried it and agree."
3,Mainly a Reader,"This book is very nice as an Old English reader, having a variety of excerpts from different text and an English translation on the opposite page which is very helpful. I would not, however suggest that one buys this book for it's grammar though. The grammar sections is very brief, and not well organized for my liking, doing things like introducing a verb form, then shifting to a noun form, then back to some other verb forms, then a few more noun forms. Mind you, this is not chapterized like a Wheelock's latin, but just a simple heading maybe half way down the page. Also, no discussion of anything to do with things such as syntax.Over all, this is great as a reader, but you will need to get another book for something more than the most cursory grammar."
4,a different take on Silicon Valley,"We have all heard of the growth of Silicon Valley after World War 2. There have been many good accounts of its technological history. Here, Steinberg and his co-author give a different take. Steinberg is an architect who settled in the San Jose area shortly after the war. He was commissioned to build many homes over the next 60 years.This book is his recollections of the times. How the Valley grew and grew in influence. And so too did the prices of houses. Spiralling ever upward in a trend that was only occasionally reversed. We also see cameo ""appearances"" in anecdotes of his dealings with the famous technology leaders that arose in the Valley.For those readers who want a broader sense of what might one day be considered a belle epoque, that goes beyond the merely technical, see this book. It provides an ambience for those times."
4,one word... WINNER!,on the whole i thought this video was great. the hell-in-a-cell match was breathtaking. the one downfall however was that it was at least 20mins before the rock and austin stepped into the ring - they spent way to much time beating the hell out of each other outside th squared-circle!
5,Fast and good condition,I got my book very fast and with no trouble. Would buy from this seller again.
5,"Durable, Functional and Long Lasting. Well worth the money","I've used this model for past 10+ years. I don't remember when I first used this one, but the last one I had finally died after about 10 years, earlier this spring. So, I bought another one, exactly same model. I don't remember whether I had this model or another cheaper model before the previous one.But the previous one went with me from the cold winters of Chicago to the sizzling summers of Iraq where temperature was well over 140+ degrees (I know this b/c others with Suunto watch with thermometer told me). Used it when I was swimming, kayaking, running, biking, etc. etc. I remember changing the battery at least once and changed the strap 2 or 3 times.So, when the last one died in April of 2005, I went out and bought another one. This one should last another 10 years. What more can you ask for for $20?"
3,a promer on logic,This small book is a great introduction into the subject of logic. It should be required reading for anyone wanting to communicate in a thoughtful manner.
5,"""THE"" book for the beginning and experienced wreck diver!","Extremely well written and packed with lots of useful information. My only regret is that I did not have this book before I went on my first wreck dive. Book goes into detail on wrecks up and down the NC coast - a must for anyone with an interest in diving the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Not only are wrecks given a full review, but also charter companies with boat specs and strengths and weaknesses of each charter. You cannot call yourself a serious wreck diver without this wreck bible."
5,Great formula AND a great price,"Amazon is one of the only retailers to offer the Good Start Supreme liquid concentrate for a good price. Breastfeeding did not go well for us and the information I had gathered indicates that the Good Start formula is as close to breast milk as we're going to get. You have to feed your child more often (as with breastfeeding)and the gastrointestinal upset that almost all babies encounter initially with formula is mild compared to some I've read. Amazon delivers promptly, though UPS service in my area is questionable (thrashed boxes). Overall I believe this formula to be great for my child and am pleased with Amazon's service."
3,Cute doll,"This is a cute doll and appears to be well made. However, it is lacking a zipper, which is surprising since this is a basic dressing skill. Also, the laces on the shoe are only pushed through the fabric so impossible for little hands to maneuver. Adding eyelets would make it much easier for lacing practice."
5,Great CD!,"Very rarely do I find a CD where I like ALL of the songs, but this is one of them! Great music with a wonderful message!"
5,This is a Great Cd!,"If you want a great Cd that grabs you from Track one, this is it!!! Every song has a different vibe to it, and the best part is that they give Glory to Jesus! Jesus is the center of this Cd, thats why its so good. The music is nothing you've heard before, its the most original Cd ive bought in a long time! Have fun with this one!!"
5,Great Literature,"""Ghosts"" is one of the truly great novels -- brilliantly conceived and executed; deeply insightful; sculpted by a poet's hand. Oh, to be sure, John Banville's language can be absurd and pretentious, and I found the occasional mundane vulgarity startling, jarring, and gratuitous... but hardly ruinous. I heartily recommend this book."
1,Bad service,"I placed an order for the Elk Lighting 1703 12, however they canceled it the same day. Why post it as in stock when it is not?"
2,I'm with Joan...,"...in this book, Eloise is a spoiled brat who mistreats the help. My husband says she's Paris Hilton as a child!"
4,a nice change of pace,"The trend for books that are either about or geared toward 'geeks', but not in the fantasy genre, is one that I would like to see emerge. As a software developer myself, but one that likes to get philosophical, this book was a welcome addition to the normal 'social commentary'-type of novels that I read. Coupland introduces a group of developers who work for the largest software company in the world, and decide to relinquish their benefits and stock options in order to work for a start-up whose philosophies they actually believe in. He conveys the satisfaction experienced for working for the startup versus the drudgery and monotony and eventual breakdown of working in corporate America. Its not often that we read about someone whose passion for technology matches their passion for life, but that is what exists in Microserfs."
5,A classic for the Gen X crowd,"Although there are more than enough reviews here already, I had to add my two cents. I read this book years ago and yet I still think of it each week. Yes, it's that good. For those who insist that you need to know something about computers to enjoy it, you're wrong. I'm not a computer geek and I found this to be one of the more significant books I've read. It's not only funny, it's touching. This is a book where you literally ""feel"" the struggles of each character. A note to Douglas Coupland - we relate."
5,NOT just a book for computer programmers!,"I can assure you, you've never read anything like ""Microserfs"" before, and it may take some getting used to, but you will not regret it. I've read ""Microserfs"" numerous times, and each time it's like revisiting an old, treasured friend. Fantastic!"
2,"Promising start, fizzled out.","The first pages were a wonderful peek inside the walls of Microsoft headquarters -- the culture, the personalities, etc. I wanted more of that, and was disappointed when the characters left to start their own venture. The book quickly became a story of relationships that I found mostly uninspired."
5,If you have to read one other Coup book aside from Gen X . .,"...this is it. I think it's the most interesting, more structurally sound Coupland book I've read so far. It is funny...and sad at the same time. The attention to details did it. All hail to the Coup!"
5,The 90s - An Era of Software,"This is a veritable time capsule for those people who lived in software development environments in the 1990s.There are points in this book, after rereading it in 2003, that just make me think ""Yeah, I remember that sort of stuff"". I wasn't a Microsoft employee, but... things happened then that affected everyone in the industry. In one of the chapters, Coupland even refers to Microsoft as an 'office supply company'.This book is about being a techie in the 90s, and having dreams and aspirations of being more. It's about layoffs at IBM, it's about life as a developer/debugger... It's a lot like 'Pirates of Silicon Valley', only personalized to a real human being who lived in that era - a person who lived, who loved, who had a family, and who dealt with life as a techie.The 90s were good years to be in the software industry. I give the book 5 stars based on my perspective. Your mileage may vary, but it's a classic on my shelf that makes me remember how things were."
5,Simply put: Funny Funny FUNNY!,"I could wax poetically about the many aspects of brilliance contained in this Coupland novel, but so many others have done so quite brilliantly. By far, best reviews written on Amazon. I would, however, like to say that I've read this book 4 times and each time it is laugh out loud funny. I liked this book even better than Generation X and Girlfriend in a Coma for this reason. I bought this book for my boyfriend who is a die hard ""techie"" that hadn't picked up a book of prose/fiction in years (if it isn't in Discover magazine or Scientific American he hasn't read it) This book actually renewed his interest in reading, much to my delight. Not many books have the power to do this."
5,Reveries of the software junkie: geek reflections,"Microserfs is great for all the reasons enumerated by other reviews: my particular slant is that the reveries of the characters stem not from the 60's pot culture, but the new transcendent digitalheads of the 90s. Coupland's description of the main character's love relationship being like two cars that crash into each other wonderfully reflects the introverts obsessive desire to find meaning, to know, to have those ""significant life experiences"". But Coupland perfectly captures the ineffable anxiety that accompanies all introverted insights. To me the personal computer revolution was just that--extremely personal. My Dad worked for IBM, where even as kids we sensed it was ""now the fun is over"". Microsoft Windows had the promise of bringing our colors back to life, with the belief that software is fun. The ending of Microserfs is poignant, as you will see: Life after IBM? Microserfs is a significant life experience!"
5,Best damn guitar stand out there!!,I've got several of these. Trust me when I say your guitar or bass isn't going anywhere!! Keeps your prise axe safe and secure.Killer! I recommend it very much.Also I recommend the carry bag thatcan be purchased seperately.Good investment.
2,Stopped feeding this,"My dog likes this food but shortly after I started feeding it I noticed she was drinking way more water than usual. At first I didn't make the connection to the food. She's 11 years old so I wondered if she was developing diabetes. She also started having accidents in the house, which she had not done since puppyhood, so maybe a bladder infection? I took her to the vet. He checked her urine and said there was no infection but the ph was high. He suggested changing her diet. As soon as I did that my dog resumed her normal water consumption and stopped peeing in the house. This food must have a lot of salt or something. I would not recommend it."
1,HP L7650 All-in-one : Forget it,"I purchased this product for a customer as they had 4 users requiring the scanner and printer. All installed ok and HP updates came in successfully.But on day 2 problems started - 1. XP PC's wouldn't shutdown until we stopped the HP Digital Imaging Software 2. Attempts to scan starting from the PC's did nothing apart from hang the application being used 3. Prints started coming out as mirror imagesTried fixes from forums, software re-installaion etc. etc. 1 week later product boxed and sent back for a refund....what a waste of my time"
1,Worst HP printer ever,"This is the perhaps the worst printer HP has ever made. I bought this less than a year ago and it only worked ok after getting about 40 pages of print outs during the first 3 weeks. Thereafter problems started. The worst has been paper jams, on top of its eating up so much ink.I have had 4 HP printers and they all have proven to be VERY VERY bad (mainly paper jams, and print quality not to mention again their usage of so much ink). This though is the worst of them all.And mind you that I paid over [...] for this piece of junk at Costco less than a year ago - The price has come down which may indicate the supply and demand. But even if they give this printer to you for free plus [...], try to avoid it because the agony and cost associated with owning this junk is well beyond your wildest worst nightmares."
3,Heavy-Duty 1/4 size cooling racks,Quite nice and I've enjoyed them. However I found them less expensive at a local grocer where things are often overpriced.
4,Nice quality for small racks,"They're small, but get the job done for smaller baking tasks. I bake two loaves of bread at a time, so these are perfect for cooling afterwards. Good for a medium batch of cookies or similar baking batches. They're sturdy and don't take up a lot of space when not used."
3,"Good quality, but they don't fit 1/4 sheet trays properly","I bought these expecting to be able to fit them into my professional 1/4 sheet baking pans, but they are too short on all sides, and slide back and forth all over the place if you try to use these in sheet pans. I'll keep them, but they aren't what I expected...They are nice quality, so if the size works for you, then these are a good purchase and very affordable."
1,Too Small,"This grate measures 8 X 10 inches. I bought it in a bundle of two items to go with my half-size sheet pan (18 X 13 inches). Obviously, Amazon didn't bother to compare the dimensions of the pan and grate before selling them as a pair, and the dimensions of the grate are not noted on the web site. Another thing to return..."
2,Wrong product recieved...,"I was really excited for this reel, but when I opened the packaging..I found a cheaper model of the alpha big-water. I really don't want to have to return this reel, but I am disappointed. Hopefully, the reel at least doesn't have drag problems like some of the other customers said with other alpha big-water reels. I didn't notice any, but I didn't catch a fish to see anyways. The reel I received is good, but my rating is low because of getting a cheaper model...and because I don't have high hopes for the reel even though it feels good and looks good. That is because of the other customers complaining about their drag tightening itself and them losing fish. However, these reels are probably good anyways. I think the saltwater reels were the ones with the problems...not sure."
2,Greatly anticipated....Deeply disappointed,"I anxiously awaited the mid-May release of ""Oxygen"" only to be severly disappointed. I thought the recording would grow on me as I am a big Avalon fan. Granted, there are two...MAYBE three songs that I like...but the messages appear a bit shallow..and the sound just doesn't hit the mark like their previous 4 recordings (including their Christmas release). Also...I can't bare to listen to song #7. Reminds me too much of N'Sync. Do we need really need another boy-band song? It's just not them (Avalon)."
3,A good workout if you are low on time.,"I liked this workout mainly because it was 45 minutes in total. I wouldn't consider it to be an excellent workout, but it is not bad for a quick workout. There is 30 minutes of step and interval training, 8 minute warm-up, 4 minute abs and a cool down. An exercise tube and weights are also required. If you enjoyed this workout, you will probably also like Keli Roberts Circuit training workout, which is also a step interval workout, but is a little more challenging and an hour long."
2,Not What I Expected.,"I'am a big fan of Gin Miller, but this video was not what I expected. The camera angles make the workout very hard to follow. They give you to many upclose shots of Gin's face and not the workout. If your tall (I'm 5'9"") I found it hard to use the resistance tubing. I recommend hand weights instead.I also do not recommend this video. Instead look into Step Reebok The Video (the original and still the best) and Step Reebok Intense Moves. Both have Gin Miller and give you a great workout."
3,Disappointed..,"I was slightly disappointed with this tape. I currently use the Reebok Power workout and find it much better. This one just doesn't get my heart rate up enough. I'll definitely use it again, but not on a regular basis."
3,Hard to follow,"I had the equipment and decided to try this video. With more use this video should be fine, but for a beginner its a little hard to follow."
4,Taken by suprise!!!!,"As a fan of DREAMLAND, and other remixes by Miles, I decided it would be worthwhile to check out his latest effort ORGANIK. I was totally taken by suprise, as it does not sound anything like his previous works... It has a much darker and at times raw feel to it, but it is a captivating work of music nonetheless... I really enjoy ""Trance Shapes"" and the guitars he has incorporated. The music teases you, takes you up, and back down -- all the while on a furious melodic groove. You rarely see an artist change their style as drastically as Miles has with this release, hence the suprise. But lovers of music will surely find much to revel in this latest experience of sonic delight, cheers to Miles, keep the changes coming!!!!"
1,Listen to this CD BEFORE buying it.,"I had to check to make sure there was not another singer that goes under Robert Miles. This does not even sound close to his first 2 CDs. By the ratings listed, if you like his first two albums - odds are you won't like this one AND if you did not care for his first 2 albums you might like this one. I for one will stick with his first 2 albums and sell this one or use it as a frizbee/coaster."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I hate to say this but ""Organik"" was far from anything I expected from Robert Miles. After a five year wait since his previous effort ""23 AM"", I was eager to hear what Robert had to offer musically after such a prolonged absence. As the saying goes ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"".To begin with it is apparent that Robert got dropped from Arista Records, because now he is on a smaller label called ""Shatki"" but I could be wrong. From the moment I heard ""Tsbol"", the first track off ""Organik"" I knew immediately something was not right. This was just too bizarre coming from Robert Miles, and I wasn't liking it. From there the music just went downhill. I couldn't enjoy it as much as I did with ""Dreamland"" and ""23 AM"". I understand that an artist should be allowed to grow and to develop their talents but at the same time the artist should realize that change can be difficult for his/her fans like me for example. I hate to say this but I'm sorry I bought this cd."
1,Not his work!,This is obviously not Miles' best work. It sounds more like the work of a New Age Tibettan Monastery that Miles just put his name on. Would not recommend this CD.
4,Music to woo your computer,"Plonks, Blips, and beeps, these are the sounds of To Rococo Rot, but instead of the usual programmed whonkery they make a beautiful, warm brand of techno. This is the melancholy music your computer would listen to as the sun sets. Or these days, the soundtrack to a VW Beetle ad.The palette of instruments is essentially the same on each song, with drums, synth melodies, occasional strings or acoustical guitar backing up the various bleepery. Occasionally the band resemble early Autechre (""This Sandy Piece"") or grate more than fascinate (""She loves Animals"") , but as a whole they succeed in bringing warmth to cold machinery. And at a little over 40 minutes, they get their point across without getting too monotonous."
5,Strong Bonds,"This is a sterling work that I highly endorse. This is an invaluable work for people who have siblings with autism; for families; for educators and other interested persons.Emily's older brother Daniel has autism. She naturally wants to know why she cannot communicate with him consistently and what prompts him to behave and respond as he does. Emily's parents acknowledge Emily's anger, concern and other feelings and allow her to explore. I like the conversations they had. I also like the way Daniel is accepted and how some of his more outlandish behavior is explained and not condoned. Reasonable expectations are set for Daniel, always with the hope of contant, continued improvement.The dynamics among this family are what makes this book so strong. It is a book that will resonate in one's mind long after finishing the last page."
3,Ok for muscle pain.,"I bought this for my muscle pain. When you rub it on it feels nice and cool, but it only takes a little pain away. If your looking to make your pain go completely away, get something else."
4,good for those planning to live in Holland,"This is a detailed guidebook, almost too detailed for someone trying to get a country overview for initial trip planning. Providing good coverage of even smaller towns and issues such as pregnancy or education, it is most helpful for those living in or spending an extended time in the Netherlands. Try another book to get your bearings, then use this one for helpful and detailed information about places, museums, and interesting cultural facts."
2,Kaplan strengths and weaknesses.,Kaplan strength = does a good job in selecting sample test questions and does a good job in listing enough questions.Kaplan weakness = Content weak. Instead of three sample tests the actual content is needed.I review study guides for a living! They also need a strong bibliography and focused content.
2,Can't match the original vinyls,"As a big fan of many of their time-tested songs, these remakes do not approach the quality of the originals, nor do they capture the flavor and depth of Rob Grill's vocals. As I enjoy listening to the tunes, unfortuneately, I can't play my vinyls in the car."
4,SHEER RETROSPECTIVE,"Although this recording is truly representative of Grass Roots' finest work, it lacks theme and progression. This band was ubiquitious in the early 70s, and one thinks there is a message somewhere. There must be. They were way good not to have a plan. But you won't find it here. Thats for sure. A jukebox delight, and thats all."
5,excellent lotion applicator,Nice long handle makes it easy to use. Thin gels or very thick lotions are problematic as are heated ones. Can be used as an over all applicator not just for the back. Easy to clean. Has 5 compartments to insure even application which may be a little annoying to fill.The shiping charge was outrageous.
3,Its ok but not for everybody,same as above was ok good for boxing students or fan may be to long for others.i would recommend to boxing friends
3,Ho hum.,"I have no major complaints about this book. I've known some Jasons, read many of their reports etc. From what I can tell the book has an accurate description of the culture group. There is alot about the history that I had not known, and some interesting anecdotes. In those rare cases the author attempts some technical discussion it seems reasonably accurate for this level of book. I didn't give it more stars because I just didn't find it that interesting. When you get down to it, the Jasons are just a group that gets together and writes reports for the government. It's hard to get too much mileage out of that. Sure, many of the members are really smart, but reading multiple statements to the effect that ""so and so is really really smart"" doesn't do much for me. Show me don't tell me. Not enough meat, I guess is what I'm saying."
1,Worst Diaper Pail EVER!,"Update: These pails do not work at all...I should have listened to the other reviewers. Every time it opens to put a diaper in the smell of the diapers hit you like a ton of bricks and then it lingers in the room...I hate these diaper pails! I ended up trashing these pails and getting the diaper genie, which I love, I wish I had just bought them first."
5,what I was looking for,"On second week of use and love it. I did not want a huge pail or genie that held a month's worth of dirty diapers. This holds about 4 days worth, and is sealed tightly enough that I do not smell anything when it is full. The little lid has a compartment for a deodorizer. I use the nursery Arm and Hammer ones and I think it gives it enough weight to shut tightly so no odor escapes. I use medium trash bags (8 gallon) and they fit perfectly. For the price and size, you cannot beat this. If odor ever becomes a problem I plan on throwing a scented fabric softer sheet on the bottom of the pail. So far, a great purchase."
2,Smelly,"This was a good price, but not as good as the diaper genie when it comes to smell. After putting just a few diapers in I could really smell them. Yuck!"
3,"Decent, cheap pail","For the money spent this did what I expected. It has held up great for 5 months. I use regular grocery bags in it. It holds roughly a day's worth of dirty diapers (and really I do not want them sitting around longer than that. When it is full I transfer them to the washer which I use as a 'wet pail on the second day). The step portion does not work very well, but has also not been an issue for my husband and I. The pail contains smells well and holds diapers, which is about all that I expected it to do. I meets, but in no way exceeds my expectations."
1,Would not buy again!,This does nothing to keep the smell of diapers from getting out. The lid is too thin. It is hard to take the lid off and on when emptying the pail. I bought it to have at my house when grandkids visit and didn't want to spend a lot. It was cheap and is worth less than I paid for it.
4,diaper pail,"The diaper pail is smaller than we expected, however with the pedal we don't have to use any hands to open and dispose of the diapers. That is a real plus. And because it is so much smaller than most, we have to empty it more often and therefore we don't have odor."
2,"Too small, Way too small",This came in the mail off our registry today and I couldn't believe they sell a diaper pail that's the size of a small bathroom trash can. Guess I should have read the dimensions more closely! Makes no sense to me why this is helpful when it can hardly hold anything. Especially for $20 for a trash can to be this tiny. I am headed out to just go buy a kitchen trash can with a lid.Also we have cloth diapers and this makes the size even more unrealistic!
3,Fine For The Price,"Wasn't really expecting much, just wanted a cheap system for our bedroom. It fills up quickly, and our regular garbage bags are too big for the pail. We just fill it up in our bedroom and dump the diapers into the big kitchen garbage, and start all over again until the reused bag in our bedroom starts to stink (fine for at least 4 loads). It's fine for our needs, we don't notice nasty smells lingering like I expected, so pretty happy with it overall."
4,Great for cloth diapers!,"We've used this pail for 2 months, and have only minor complaints... It is quite short, so I have to lean over pretty far to get under the lid. Also, it's difficult to get the lid on tight, and if too loose, the pedal won't open the top all the way and I have to lift it by hand.Because we cloth diaper, the small size is a good thing. It holds about 12-14 cloth diapers, which makes for good timing to do laundry. It only smells when open (I don't have any air freshener/filter in it), and is easy to use when the lid is on tight. Cost is right, and I'm glad we didn't spend more than we needed to (babies are expensive enough)."
4,THE BEST !!!,This product is excellent quality !! It also arrives very very quickly and is everything that you see in the image !!
1,Missing inside image wrong product,Look at the picture very carefully. The inside view was missing and this product was not the correct one for my storm door. I added an image so that no one else will buy the wrong product. Shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen.
1,Not a Quality Stroller,"I did quite a bit of research on strollers when my daughter was born in 2006. I wanted a good stroller, not too bulky that would be a great stroller to use for her as a toddler. This stroller did not meet my expectations. It was not too bad to use when used as a travel system, but when used as a stroller for a toddler it was awful. You have to push with two hands at all times. The cup holder always falls off. The safety harness is confusing (my husband could never remember how to hook it up). And for being such a light weight travel system, it is not even functional at the mall.We are going to get rid of ours before baby #2 comes, b/c I don't want to deal with the stroller again. We recently bought a $20 umbrella stroller at Babies R Us...and the umbrella stroller is 100% better than this Mosaic."
4,My favorite stroller,I love this stroller. I have it in the black and red. I used it with my son for 2 years and now I am using it for my daughter. It fits my Graco snug ride car seat just right. It is easy to fold even while holding the child and is not heavy. Does not take up as much room as other full sized strollers. I also like the removable cup holder. The basket is also plenty big.The only CON i have found is the shade can be pulled off to easily. When my son go over a year old he would pull it off all the time. I had to start leaving it in the car.
3,"Great stroller, but squeaks like crazy!","I love this stroller. The only issue I have is that is makes the WORST noise ever! I've written to Graco about the issue and hope they can help me fix it. I actually heard a squeaky noise in the store the other day and I looked, and it was the SAME one I have! We have the Jewel color, pink and brown. Otherwise, great lightweight compact stroller!"
5,Cantilever Mount Provides Flexibility,"This mount was used for a 26"" LCD. We needed the flexibility of being able to have the TV flat against the wall when not in use and to extend it out when needed so small groups can all view the screen. The cantilever mount allowed us to do that and was a perfect solution. The arm extends so we can pull the TV out about 2 feet and we can turn it to face different directions.Great product and a must if you want to have the flexibility to have your TV mounted flat against a wall and be then adjust to pull out away from the wall."
2,Not impressed,"If you want to mount your television near the ceiling you'd better get help. You have to have at least a couple of people hold the TV while trying to find the holes with the screws.The screws didn't fit; either too long or too short even with the supplied spacers.There is no doubt that it's strong and will support the heaviest of monitors.In short, there are better solutions out there. I wouldn't purchase this model in the future."
5,TV Wall Mount,"This is the second of these mounts that I have purchased for different locations. It is a good looking, easy to use and sturdy mount. It is very easy to install once you locate a stud."
5,Agribusiness at their worst,A must read for all those interested in where our food comes from and who has been controlling its production. Frightening and enlightening.
1,my purchase,"i used this coffee maker for two weeks and the water level gauge does not work, it shows moore water than it actually has in it. The milk does not foam, i used all the different types of milk, nothing. I am totally disappointed."
2,no heat,Expresso did not get hot enough. We tried with different amounts of water without sucess. I had to pay for return for what I considered a defective product.
2,"Good coffee, disappointing machine","We've been through two of these machines in five years. That may be good for some people but for $100 we thought it would work longer. Even with constant cleaning, after awhile it takes forever to brew a pot and most of the water/coffee is lost in steam. The handle also broke off of the espresso ground holder the first or second time we used it. We're going for another brand this time around."
3,Krups XP1500 Coffee and Espresso Combination Machine,"Normally the machine is good. However, the one I purchased leaked badly. It had to be sent back for repair, and Krups does not pay for the shipping. It has not yet returned, so whether or not it has been repaired properly is not known."
1,Poor Expresso Machine,"I've bought this Coffee and Expresso Combination but it isn't an expresso machine at all. I'd an old Krups Combination Machine and thought it would be the same, it isnt! Crap expresso!"
2,Doesn't last long,"I used to have a separate krups coffee make and espresso maker. I love the espresso maker because I can make more coffee then most. The frother works well, you just have to learn how to do it right. After six years I decided it was time to replace both when I broke the carafes to each machine. So, I decided to get this double machine. The coffee pot just stopped working. I clean it out with vinegar on a regular basis so I know it wasn't calcified water. When I turn it on, the hot plate doesn't heat and the water doesn't get sucked through the hose into the pot. The espresso maker still works, but the coffee is never hot enough. I always have to microwave the coffee after it's made. So, now I'm looking for separate machines less then two years after I bought this. I don't know if I just got a bad machine or if there's something about the way this is designed, but it's never given me hot coffee."
1,Do not recommend,"I previously had a Krups espresso/coffee maker and loved it. It was a much more expensive model, but it lasted over 10 years. This model fell way short. 1) It lasted less than a year. The coffee side just stopped working. 2) The milk steamer didn't work well from day one. I microwaved the milk before steaming, because the steamer didn't heat the milk. 3) The steam arm was flimsy and placed too low on the machine. You have to tilt the cup of milk to get it under the arm. And, when you tilt the cup of milk, it spills. Duh. 4) The steam arm made bubbly milk, but not a smooth frothy hot milk that you want. 5) Even though we cleaned the coffee side regularly, it seemed to always drip slow."
3,Not very well made.,"First of all let me say this product makes a fair cup of coffee, and a pretty good cup of espresso--and I am very picky. That said, it is not very well put together and it doesn't have features that I really like in a coffee maker. It tends to leak water from the bin where you put the grounds. It does not have an automatic turnoff. The plate gets pretty hot and will cook your coffee if you don't turn the thing off after you brew a pot. It can't be programmed to start brewing on its own. The frother attachment is a joke. For $100 you can do better."
4,Worth What Your Paying For,"I've had my combo machine for about three years now and must say I'm fairly pleased with it. As said in other reviews it is a little tricky and takes some getting the hang-of it, but if you play with it for a bit it gives you more control then you would have imagined. For the price it may be hard to find anything that delivers what this unit can, don't go into this purchase with the thoughts of an easy, breezy, set it and forget it operation. It takes a little multi-tasking to come up with a great tasting Carmel Macchiato."
4,Good Machine,i bought this for a birthday present and its been in use everyday at least a couple times a day!! Great Buy!
3,NOT as good as XP1530 - which is what I expected,"No auto shutoff, requires paper filters as Krups good filters do not fitFound customer service a bit surly when I called to ask where to get gold filter (we don't) and issue of auto shutoff (not offered) ..."
2,Large and cheaply made,"I ended up returning this due to its size which was significantly larger than the Krups 1992 model I was replacing. Also, it didn't seem well made again compared to the older model. In full disclosure, it seems I would need to pay nearly three times this price to get a product I will satisfy me. So, I am saving my pennies."
4,2nd one I've owned,"This is my second one of the same model and the coffee maker works well except the access to the filter assembly latch is very difficult to open on this one. Espresso machine is not the 14 bar pressure system as with the very expensive models, but for the price makes great latte's and espresso and has made me very popular with my wife and our guests. Has saved me a fortune in barista bills when she wants a Carmel Latte. I recommend that you purchase a stainless milk steamer and a small thermometer to get a good product. Last one made coffee every day and lasted over 4 years before the heating element quit working."
2,Disappointed :(,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE ""The Business of Being Born""!! I had high hopes for ""More Business of Being Born"" and was hoping that it would contain more indepth information and interviews than it's predecessor. Unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in content and honestly, quite boring. I was really disappointed and would not recommend. I do however give ""The Business of Being Born"" 5 stars!!"
4,Good game for learning profit/loss,This game is good for teaching basic concepts of profit and loss and learning the basics of process sequences. It is a good way to introduce the concepts of small business to children and is very entertaining.
2,not age appropriate,This game is very hard to understand & is definitely NOT for anyone under (at least) 13 yrs old
4,Great Watch,"I've actually owned this for 4 years and it has worked quite well. I've actually smashed this thing into walls and rock and even drench this thing in water over that time. It has a timing function, a alarm, dual time zones, and beeps hourly if you set it to do so. Sadly, after 4 years of my abuse the band is starting to wear and it hasn't quite worked the same since I took it to Wall-mart for a battery change a couple months ago(doesn't beep anymore and keeps on suddenly resetting itself). However, I have to say that it's a great watch."
5,At long last!,If you've started playing poker and are looking at improving your game...this is the book you need. Look no further!!!The last thing you want to do when you start playing is not to be involved in the game. Bob's book changes all of that. Bob shows you how you don't have to play 2 hands an hour but can instead play over 30...profitably!As I write this there is only 1 book left in stock!! Go get it!!
4,Here is the track list:,"This cd, released in 1999 on Domino Records (UK) has three songs:1. Carrot Rope2. Harness your Hopes3. Roll with the Wind"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I purchased this camera just for casual use when I don't want to take my SLR out under questionable weather conditions and risk getting it damaged. Bottom line, this was $50 from Walmart, and a true case of ""you get what you pay for"".. horrible picture quality, the ""OK"" button only works once in awhile, there is about a 5 second lag time between taking one picture and the next, and it won't even erase a photo like it's supposed to. Needless to say I am returning this poor quality item. Don't waste your money on this!"
2,Over Priced,Small paper backed book on the basics of pawn-brokering. The content of the book was very basic although some good content for anyone considering going into the pawn business. [...]
2,Need a glass cutter that doesn't cut glass? Here ya go!,"I have used several glass cutters, this particular cutter had a hard time scoring the glass. I ended up breaking one piece of glass before doing the smart thing- driving to Home Depot, spending a little more on product and gas, but knowing what I was getting."
5,So Easy!,"Installed on a 1996 Toyota Tacoma, this hitch was far easier to install than I had expected. I only have minimal experience with automotive mechanics so I think if I could get this hitch on then pretty much anyone could.I was able to get it done in about and hour. The hardest part of the entire job was getting the factory installed bolts out of the hitch, I can't understand why they would put so much torque on bolts that need to be removed prior to installing. Once the bolts were out the job was quick and easy. Since the hitch is designed to install in separate pieces I didn't need any help from a second person to hold it up while bolting it on.Once the hitch is on the only visible part of the assembly is the receiver, the rest of the hitch is tucked up behind the bumper, so it has a very clean look."
4,Great for the novice,"If you are a novice at this type stuff you need this dvd to help you ""unleash"" the potential of this program."
4,Tasty,I bought a case of these noodles and was impressed with the quality. It is greenish in color and has a hint of spinach taste to it that I really liked. It is hearty and fills you up. In summary I really liked it and would buy it again.
2,Decent noodles but not Gluten free,"These noodles contain wheat -- which last time I checked has gluten in it, so I guess it is obvious that you should not buy if you are allergic to wheat.The non-allergic people in our family ate the noodles and they taste like normal noodles but are green. Nothing too exciting."
4,Civil War Usage,I purchased this book to help me understand the terms used during the Civil War for a history project I am working on. The book is easy to read and the terms that I needed where easy to find as well as suggestions for terms that went along with what I was looking for. It will be a great addition to my history part of my home library and the price was reasonable. The book has also spurred my interest in other subjects connected to some of the terms I found in the book. Great book for anyone working on the Civil War.
4,Mrs. Angelo's Seventh Grade Reading Group 1,"We give this book 4 stars because most of the book is entertaining and amusing. It is about Kevin's baseball life and his poetry life and how they are similar. The book is written in free verse and some of the poems are written in traditional poetry.It is about how he becomes more mature and tells us his feelings about life and his mom, and his friend Mira.There is a mature part that you should be 12 or over to read. Some people who don't like baseball might not understand the book as well."
5,Gracias,"Hola! estoy muy satisfecha con la compra que hice, el reloj llego totalmente sellado y con todas las medidas de seguridad y proteccion pertinentes.Muchisismas gracias!"
2,Call this one confusing,"This watch (to us) is a perfect example of too many functions sharing too few buttons. The sequencing of buttons you push must be perfect or one has to start the process all over again. Could not ever see getting used to all of the features. We are not luddites, but this watch was not user-friendly and we returned it immediately."
3,Really Good Music But There Is Better Out There,"Im just starting to warm up to ELEGEION, there music is very melodic and I totally agree with newen. However Ive been listning to alot of Death/Black Metal or whatever you want to call it and ive heard alot of stuff by TRISTANIA and I think they are absolutly brilliant. Dont shun ELEGEION but also check out TRISTANIA."
2,A simplified (and conspiracy-based) book on PR,"OK. So we wrap advertising, news, public relations and public relations into one book to whow how THEY try to influence you how to think. Well, if it's big news that governments wait to release bad infor when it will have a minimal impact then you probably weren't paying attention to start out. The author has some very good points about ""junk news"" (which I agree with) but the fact is we have a market-driven economy. If you don't like U.S. news networks, with their entertainment and rubbish stories, then watch BBC news, which is available as part of most cable packages. The fact that most Americans don't might say something about our tastes in programming but what can you do about that?If you're serious about learning about how PR works and aren't staring at your TV screen looking for product placements on Star Trek The Next Generation episodes then there are better books out there. Not as flashily packaged, interestingly enough, but they're out there."
3,"Great sound for music. TV dialog, not so much.","For music the sound was truly impressive out of such a small package. Sound was quite comparable to similar sized Bose products. However, when using it for movies, regular conversation in movies never sounded natural, partly because the speakers were about a foot below the tv. But when I hooked back up my old Marantz stereo with a couple small satlelite speakers and a sub, the sound was soooo much better. I boxed it back up and resold it. Maybe whoever bought it will have a different experience."
4,Good Book,"I chose this book because I was in love with Paulina Simmon's Bronze Horseman series, so I decided to try something else by this author hoping to find a similar love story. This book is not a love story but more of a mystery. I still enjoyed it and I am a big fan of Paulina's writing as she knows how to draw you in. I must have read this book in less than 2 days as I would pick it up every chance I could get. I would definitely recommend it, but not as a way to fill your void of the Alexander and Tatiana love story."
2,Can't get past page 54. The most boring book I've read in ages.,I've read 54 pages and I can't stand it any longer. Other reviewers talk about this book being interesting in the beginning then taking a dive..if this juvenile endlessly boring drivel is considered the best part of the book then I need go no farther.
1,Wrights products changed part but not part number,"Caution to anybody that is expecting a lockset! Like two other recent buyers, I also received a lockset without a lock!I called Wright Products, and THEY changed the item without changing the part number! I was told that this change occurred in the last six months. The point is - it is not the fault of the sellers!Wright's web page continues to depict and describe a lock-able version for the VBG115SN or VBG115PB locksets. I e-mailed them - hopefully they will fix their website.P.S. Wright Products did tell me that they can still provide the lock-able version, but it will be special order only. The special order part number for the brass version is 97045-098. I was told to special order through Home Depot, Lowes, or DoItBest Hardware."
4,coverralls,i'm a 3x man the only company that had my size i would definlety recomend for other men that work out side in cold weather
1,Sized right,Needed short length and it was as stated. The sizing was very consistent and the quality of Walls was good
2,chesse head to space,i brought the red star cd four years i thought i was cool have death metals covering rush but some many songs wrere you had preson singing like waye static from static x and a other person. singing like sade tears was the best sudivisions the wost track on the cd.
1,What a waste...,"There is not a band in the world that is talented enough to cover a Rush song, and these clowns are no exception. What a embarassment. Rush ought to sue them for even trying. This is like trying to re-write the bible using an illiterate blind-deaf-mute and a box of broken crayons. Anyone who likes this travesty is not really a Rush fan, no matter how hard they try to convince themselves. Do not waste your money."
1,Trash on the highway,"i bought this because i was curious, then i listened to it, and got really angry. i heard the samples and i thought it couldn't possibly be that bad, but it certainly was. when i got it, i listened to it once, then i picked my friend up, we were listening to it in my car, and he threw it out the window. so, if anyone happens to see a cd on rt.195 just outside of providence, be sure to run it over."
1,Throw up,"is what I want to do hearing this utter garbage. These bunch of amateur brats are attempting to cover some of the greatest music of all time with their hokey, fake-Metallica style. Think of the worst local metal band you have ever heard (oh they are bad), then multiply that by 10. This is worse!!! Please don't even think about buying this album."
3,Interesting and priceless,"Hey I heard the tracks before purchasing this album, and I said that this just has to be owned. Yes some of the songs are terrible (Tom Sawyer and Bastille Day), but some are just plain kewl, especially the last three songs on the album. It also blows my mind to hear a rush song with the ""mf"" word in it (What You're Doing). It's just me, who owns everything by Rush to the point that I had to have this too, no matter how bad it was."
1,"Garbage, Disgusting, Trash, Insulting, Refuse, Excrement","Some adjectives to put this effing trash in perspective. These guys are an embarassment to themselves and the music of Rush. If you like this fecal matter, you are NOT a Rush fan."
2,use with caution!,"I bought this book soon after it came out. In February 1990 I wrote to the publishers with a 9-page list of errors I had detected in it. Since it is a reference work, these matter! The author replied indicating that he would make the appropriate corrections if there were a new edition.Most of the book is valuable and helpful; but don't take everything it says as necessarily correct."
4,Great for Conspiracy Theory Buffs,"I first read this book twenty odd years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it . . . saw it in the Kindle store, bought it, and enjoyed it just as much the second time round.Harbinson writes a great UFO story based on his extensive archival research, and the whole premise of the novel will thrill the conspiracy theorist in you. If words like ""UFO"" and ""conspiracy"" get your mind working, grab this one . . . and wonder, ""what if"""
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A Saucerful Of Secrets.Here is an interesting book that plays pretty well upon all the crazy UFO conspiracy stuff, so if you have a fondness or liking for that, then you will probably really like this book.Secret locations, covered up bases, all that kind of thing, you get the idea."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"I normally use Elixer strings, I tend to like the larger gague strings as well. After reading some of the reviews on these strings I thought I might be getting a nice, warm sound from them. NOPE! They sound hollow, cheap, and I wish I wouldn't have put them on my guitar... blah."
1,Nice ... Until it Broke,"I purchased one of these in February 2007. It worked like a dream until it broke after three months of normal use. I contacted the seller, who didn't reply. Save your money and go with the $10 model, or buy an old-fashioned bellows without as many moving parts. This one is prettier than the cheap model, but it seems to have disposable insides."
4,"Great Info, Projects can help, but most are filler","This book helped me alot with my airbrushing skill. I wish he had written more of the general info as well as some beginner lessons. The projects are ok, I would do a coulpe mabey, but they don't help as much as beginner stroke, and shadowing lessons would have. More info on how to(try) do artwork with a single action brush. All in all a great resource."
4,Descent into China,"Su Tong leaves you grasping for hope. These three novellas, general enough for an American to grasp yet specific to the Chinese milieu, probe the underside of human nature. With emphasis on class, the people's revolution, and the organic nature of life, the author confronts the bestial facets of living in the underclass."
5,Very Nice Set,"Very nice chips in a very nice case. Like the feel of chips and case contains lots of extras for games. Compact but sturdy. Good price, as advertized."
4,Great Guide for canoers/floaters,This is a great guide book for Arkansas and S. Missouri rivers. If you need information about a river in AR./Mo. then this is the book to start your research.
2,"Oh no, I Soilent in my pants","Im not sure why this album is getting such great reviews from all these other people here? Perhaps if I heard one of these songs on the radio by themselves they might be alright. Once you put them together thats when trouble starts. This ablum is just sooo boring, I cant stand it. And the songs are just sooo long. Ben has lost his aggressive voice. He sounds strained. Need proof? check out they're albums Pussysoul, A Deleted... and of course A String of Lies EP. When you compare these to Confrontation you cant help but think that this album is not at all like its predecessors.On a related note. You can also hear Bens downfall On Goatwhore. The first one was great then they progressively get really, really bad."
5,I highly recommend this book to ANYONE who has lost a pet,"Everyone I knew thought I was nuts to be so upset about losing my dog, but I loved her so much. I didn't know what to do or how to deal with my pain. This book has letters from people just like me -- I couldn't believe it -- who felt just as bad as me, but who learned how to deal with the pain. This book saved me & I am so grateful."
2,Good for one track,"If you want a copy of the radio version of New, this is the place to get it. It's probably cheaper than the Go soundtrack, but if you like No Doubt music, the other three remixes aren't worth listening to. 2 stars for the CD as a whole, 5 stars for track one."
1,Exerpts,"Be aware that this tape runs about 30 minutes. Among other things, all male soloists are omitted."
4,A crackling good disaster novel.,"Richard Martin Stern's The Tower is one of the two novels that Irwin Allen's production of The Towering Inferno was based, the other being The Glass Inferno by Scorita and Robinson.On the gala opening of the latest world's tallest building, an unstable construction worker detonates a bomb and starts a fire that spirals quickly out of control, leaving the celebrants trapped on the top floors. As the fire climbs closer and the situation grows grimmer, the characters true natures are revealed, and some are not pretty. The elements Irwin Allen used in his film version are easily found, but they work far better in the source material. An excellent suspense story with a refreshing and somber finale, highly recommended."
5,Good Ol Country,"This guy is great, different and new, but just the old timey that makes you want to listen again and again. Buy it, you won't be sorry!!!"
5,There is no sweeter voice,"Buy it. Listen. After hearing this wonderful man sing ""Cowpoke"", you'll be haunted forever by the sheer beauty of his voice. And if you're not in tears or in love by the end of ""I'll Hold You In My Heart ('Til I Can Hold You In My Arms)"" then I'm sorry for you, my friend.Cherish the man and his music."
2,warranty,"It's a blender. If it breaks and it will, there is a 3 yearwarranty. The labor cost under warranty is $125.00 + tax.You pay the shipping costs. So it's a minimum of $150.00to get it repaired under warranty.I've only used it at home one year during the summer months inNew England and have to send it in for repair already.Now what kind of commercial blender is that. Buyer beware!It may cost you over a thousand dollars for your occasionalsmoothie.I could never recommend this blender. I am truly sorry Iever purchased this machine, sadly I'm stuck with it fora little while longer. I just want to spare any potentialbuyers away from this machine. Sadly it's too light for aboat anchor, quite useless in many ways."
4,Essential Manual for Team Building,"One of the main challenges of any team leader is getting their team to work together and really leverage their different styles. With the emphasis within modern business on ""diversity"", there are few good definitions about what that means. We have gone beyond the typical gender / ethnic / racial categories to disabilities / preferences and other meaningless classifications. The work on the Myers-Briggs type indicator is by far the best approach to understanding how your team and workplace functions.A leader will be able to better understand the reasons for team's success and failures through the lens of their preferred personality type. This book is easy to read, provides great insights for practical application. Have you ever wondered why someone does what they do? The MBTI analysis is essential to understanding the comfort zone of your team, coworkers and even you spouse.A must have for leaders!"
5,Type Talk at Wo0rk,"I am a big fasn of Myers, Briggs personality types studies. I read these type books toget a better undrstanding about where people are coming from and what ""turns them on"" to get them to volunteer.This book broadened my understand and is a good reference book to continue to study when you can't understand how people respond to you.Rodney P. Dempsey"
3,"Parts were very good, and parts were not so good","Much of the information was useful, and some of the profiles were quite good, but some of the profiles were off."
2,Hanging problems,"I've ordered several inexpensive necklaces of a similar type to this one, all of which I've been happy with. This necklace was the exception to the rule, and is the only one I've never worn. This pendant looks nice enough, but there's a problematic design flaw. The cord or chain you use to hang the pendant around your neck goes through a metal loop which is behind the hilt of the sword (you can see this loop in one of the available images of the item). Unfortunately, this loop is over-sized and sticks out. Because it sticks out so far on the backside that should be laying against your chest, the sword is made to rest awkwardly and has to tip to one side or the other. There are a lot of other great necklaces for around this price, so I suggest you purchase one of the others which don't have this problem."
2,"Good as a description of Annie's work, a Drag as a bio.","I found this book tedious, to say the least. I have followed Annie Lennox's career since the early eighties, and having read plenty of interviews all through these years, I expected to read a book that might shed new light on this wonderful performer. Instead I found a comprehensive body of work regarding the description of every single song and video performed by her. That is great for die-hard fans thirsty for details, but fails to grasp the reader's attention for long and should by no means be the final goal of any biography! Besides the authors failed to bear in mind that most A.L.'s fans are over their 30's and that the biography was Annie Lennox's and not Shakira's, for the use of storytelling-like idiomatic expressions (e.g. ""...at the tender age of six..."") and the lack of depth in the subject matter of the book is more suitable for a teenage pop idol biography! All in all, buy the book if you crave for the info, otherwise avoid it!"
3,Pleased with Sales Advice,I am fairly new to the the real estate residential sales field. I formerly leased apartments on the east coast. I am now licensed to sell property in California. This book helped me beef up my sales repertoire and organize myself as an agent. There are lots of small tidbits of advice and it is a quick read. I would say that it is well worth it for the price. I bought it used but it appeared brand new with the exception of a few folded pages.
3,A good start,"This book is a very good start at beginning to learn and understand body language but, in itself, is far from the ultimate guide. Since the book is rather dated and is released as one of the first books about the subject, it should be obvious that many more studies and research has been done on the topic. That is not to say that this book doesn't still serve its original purpose: an introduction to the subject, which it still does quite well."
2,Very outdated,"This book was first published in 1970. Maybe, at that point in time, people found the little bit of common sense in here helpful,I find that hard to beleive. Julius was very evasive in its explanations of his theories.Better books on the topic are Nonverbal Communication In Human Interaction by Mark L. Knapp, and Nonverbal Communication by Horst Ruthrof."
1,Light Weight Fluff -- No Substance,"This book has very little substance whatsoever. It should have been no longer than a magazine article. If the information in the book is true, all you need to know is don't waste your time studying body language because because it is too unreliable of a form of communication. Not even worth $5.20."
3,"Interesting at its time, but not very practical in the present.","This book was first printed in 1971; for that time it was cutting edge stuff, it isn't that useful today.If you're new to body language you should start with Allan Pease - Body Language, it also has illustrations that help you see the actual body language that he writes about.Like a previous reviewer said, you can read this for its historical value, it has some good info in it, but overall I felt that I didn't really get anything out of reading it."
2,Don't do it!,This book is an absolute hack job of disorganized and inconclusive references to what real scholars and scientists have said about the subject. Don't waste your time with it.
1,GARBAGE- Words can't describe how horrible this book is,"Jama Clark should give this book to her boyfriends and husbands- because this book is designed to give her all the things she really wants- LIKE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. She says that if you want to attract women, show them you make lots of money and be really, really good looking. Just to prove how bad her book is, look at her own relationships- She's divorced. I don't think that following the advice of a divorced woman will do anything except make your life as miserable as hers!"
1,Made me want to put myself out of my own misery.,"This is mind-numbingly dull. If you are not slap-yo-mamma passionate about dry, hardcore academic biblical studies, do NOT take whatever class has this book on its syllabus. You will rue the day you did."
3,"Empowering, encouraging but not all that","I like this book in that it is, above all, encouraging of women to find their potential, and to keep going despite what the world will throw at you. In this book you have stories from all kinds of women, women who could be your neighbors or even your friends. They have all kinds of stories, both good and bad, some even heartbreaking. It's good to hear stories from the women who don't necessarily finish first in a race, don't set world records, and aren't necessarily rail-thin -- you know, all the ones *not* in a magazine.On the other hand, the tone of the book and the rapid-fire sequence of tails can be tiring at times. I've been trying to finish this book for months -- not because it isn't good, but because it can only really be taken in doses. Overall I recommend it. :-)"
2,I wanted to buy this BUT...,"In all fairness, I didn't purchase this food but I'm sure my dog would have been crazy about it! What stopped me in my tracks was the ingredients... why is there wheat flour and sugar?? Those aren't the best quality ingredients for dogs and wheat is know to cause allergies. I'll be moving on to something with higher quality ingredients."
5,WWE: SmackDown - The Best of 2009-2010 [Blu-ray],"let me start off by saying if you are a wwe fan, you have probably seen this on tv,but for people like me who dont have cable anymore, this is great, its 9hrs+ ofgreat smackdown action from 09-10, some great matches in here, and its on blu-rayso you cant go wrong, the picture quality is amazing, way better than the hd broadcasteverything is so crisp and clear, the sound is amazing too, it comes in 2 blu-raydisc, and the price is not bad either, considering youre getting a lot of wwe action,if you are a big wwe fan, i highly recommend this"
3,Nice but not perfect,"This is a quality made product. Its built to last. Its alot bigger than the PLS model and the laser beam isn't very bright. If your doing layout more than 100 feet, find something else. If your beam is less than a 100 feet its really nice. I've used cheaper ones and they are just as good but I am still happy overall with the product."
4,A Superb Horror Film Score!,An eerily beautiful score to a motion picture which employs a unique approach of the occult.I feel the Musical pieces are very well orchestrated and many of the films more intense scenes are well enhanced by Mr Amenabar's Musical Score.To Fans of Film music I do recommend this one!
4,Good book for the child of a divorced couple.,"Although not as good as ""Amazing Grace"", this sequel touches nicely on the life of a youngster whose mother and father have divorced and life as she knows it. It demonstrates that although her father started a life with a new family, Grace is still a very important part of him and his new family."
1,P-911 woodcraft construction kit,A piece was cut incorrectly so you can't put it together. Hopefully they all aren't like this. It's expensive kindling...
2,96 pages of...,"96 pages (and not even full pages - these are some teeny, tiny pages riddled with elementary illustrations) of sometimes-amusing gripes and tips about and for the gym. The author pisses and moans a lot, which is a given considering the title, but she seems to really be annoyed with ""housewives"" and ""stay at home moms"", as they are mentioned as a group even more than the ""old folks"" that she also cannot stand for various grody reasons.The funniest comment was in the acknowledgements, where she thanks her editor/friend for ""helping me see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" which to me makes it sound like she spent more than a full month on this spare little pamphlet."
5,Serial Killers Are Nothing New!,"Lindsay Davis instantly grabs our attention and takes us on a thrilling hunt for a serial killer. Once again we learn about live in early Rome as it was lived by the average citizen. Once again, we painstakingly follow Marcos as he sniffs out an unforgettable killer of young women. This book is one of Davis' best, and it keeps your attention from the first page to the climactic ending where you cannot put the book down. I am thrilled that Davis continues to add to the ongoing saga of M. Didius Falco and look forward to enjoying another twenty years of his adventures."
5,Good CB radio,"I bought my 77-115 about 5 months ago and it has been wonderful. I also have a K40 5'6"" whip on my car and I love it."
3,disappointed,"This was disappointing. The ring around the firepit was not impressive looks very fake and somewhat ""cheap"" ..... I could have purchased same quality for less locally."
3,Works as described....but no wall charger available,"This unit paired flawlessly with the Zoom HiFi Receiver. Only gripe is that has to be charged via USB cable, there is no wall charger available (I checked their website). I have a series of USB port replicators so at home charging is easy.Since most USB wall chargers are 5V, on the road I use a Motorola cellphone charger. Zoom website does not specify the volt/amp rating for this product, so I have no idea how this will affect the longevity of the Ihifi transmitter, but it works so well that if it burns out I'll just replace it with another one."
5,Music that's just plain old fun!,Little Richard has always been one of my favourites. His songs are timeless classics and this cd has some of his best. Keep Knockin is one of my all time favourites.
2,"Dragging, boring, annoying...","I guess as a debut novel this isn't bad but it's by no means a good book. The main character has no hooks to endear herself to the reader. There's no real story to her, she's just barely above one dimensional. The rest of the cast is trotted out on a one by one ""Wait, is THIS the killer?!"" basis. The story starts nowhere and really goes nowhere. There's a killing, there's another, there's two in the past. Gasp! Are they all related?! With the exception of a couple short stories and her second novel (waiting on the nightstand as I type) I've read and enjoyed everything Ms Harris has written except this. If you're a completest, go for it, you might as well read everything. Otherwise, give this one a pass, it's not that good."
1,Not the best by Charlaine Harris...,I have read a lot of work by Charlaine Harris and this is definitely the worst one I have read by her.
1,Glad I Got This One at the Library,"Another review said ""boring, boring, boring"". I have to second that. The characters were flat and I just didn't care what happened to any of these people. This was apparently an early book of this author's, written some 20 years ago or so. I just have to say I really enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse books but this one, was a big NOT. Also, like another reviewer commented, I didn't like the reference to black people as ""darkies"". Just a turn-off for me."
1,Pass on this one,I always finish a book I start so this one was no different but I was happy when I was on the last page. And disappointed. Not much action. It feels like it was stretched. The description of African American characters makes me cringe. Not the best ever by C.Harris by far. I so miss Lilly Bard & Aurora Teagarden. This book made me give up on C.Harris' books. (not interested in vampires stories) :(
4,Charlaine Harris,"I have read every book from Lily Bard, Aurora Teagarden, and Sookie Stackhouse and check daily for anything new Charlaine Harris may write... they all end too soon for me... I want to read forever...It's like eating good food I want to chew forever making swallowing a disappointment..."
3,Early Stand Alone,"Catherine returns to her hometown of Lowfield, Mississippi after a car crash kills her parents. Six months later she is still there, working at the town newspaper and living in her old home alone.Unsatisfied with the results of the investigation of her parents' crash, Catherine is unable to move on. When her father's nurse is beaten to death and left in a shack on Catherine's farm land, she is sure there is a connection. Her father was the town's only physician and the nurse was using information she obtained while working in his office to blackmail Lowfield citizens. Suddenly, everyone in the town Catherine grew up in is a suspect, even the sheriff.If you are a fan of Harris's popular paranormal mystery series, don't miss this opportunity to read one of her earlier novels. This is a reprint of an early stand-alone mystery first published in 1981. Catherine is a complicated southern heroine with courage and intelligence. Sweet and Deadly is excellent, with a surprising ending."
2,What the heck?,Wow I wish I had ordered the sample not the book. This was like reading a rough draft obvouisly this is some of the first works Ms. Harris had published disapointing read. I can see how she has evolved as a story teller from this book. I really enjoy her other works.
5,I love the way Charlaine Harris writes.,"I've read all the Sookie Stackhouse books and all of Aurora Teagarden's adventures. While waiting for my Harper Connelly mysteries to arrive (yes, I ordered all of them), I picked up ""Sweet and Deadly"". I couldn't put it down. Charlaine Harris' characters are wonderful. The pace and tenor of the the story match that of a small southern town lifestyle. Someone mentioned they thought the book was ""racist"". The book was published in 1981.If you lived in a small southern town in 1981,you would know that ""race"" was a promintent issue in all social interactions,especially with older people. Ms Harris' descriptions are accurate for that time and place. Another great book by Charlaine Harris!"
2,Ok,"This book wasn't that great. It was a slow-paced, murder mystery set in a small town. The reader doesn't really get a chance to identify with any character.. and it seemed as though the book was 90% description, and only 10% dialogue/action. It took me a few days to get through this book because it just wasn't that interesting.I love Charlaine Harris... and I'm glad I read this book. But if you want a much better read, try the Sookie Stackhouse series (which you probably have already), the Harper Connelly series (EXCELLENT series), or the Lily Bard series (also very good).This was just Ok."
3,Everyone has to start somewhere,"I agree with the other reviewers in that this is not Charlaine Harris' best work. Everyone has to start somewhere and this is her start. The characters weren't well developed and the ending was rushed. The way that Catherine figured out ""who done it"" was sudden and didn't have enough background, not to mention that the way the revelation was made was odd. Even so, the book was an okay read. The Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris is EXCELLENT, closely followed by the Harper Connelly series. I agree with the reviewer that said don't start here if you've never read a Charlaine Harris book before. Start with Sookie and then Harper."
5,Good DVD!,"I bought this DVD since my husband and I are trying to get pregnant. I typically do Kundalini Yoga but know that some of those stretches and the breathing can be risky during pregnancy. So, I decided to purchase a few pregnancy DVD's. I've done this DVD twice. It takes approximately 40 minutes to get through. You do begin to work up a sweat near the end (like I said I'm not even pregnant yet), but it is very relaxing and soothing. The only part of the DVD that I think would be challenging to do while pregnant is the knee circles, especially if your balance is a little off. But overall, I would recommend this DVD for expecting mothers and even for those that are not expecting that wish to become better acquainted with Tai Chi practice."
2,Not Tai Chi and poor sound,"For one thing, it's not Tai Chi in any recognizable form. What it is, is a slow, repetitive series of moves derived from the traditional series of Tai Chi moves. I didn't find it to be of any muscular or cardio benefit at all. If you want to meditate, then buy something of that nature, because this doesn't fulfill that criteria, either. Plus, the DVD warns you that it isn't up to par for surround sound and so should rely on TV audio instead. Since this wasn't an inexpensive DVD it seemed that they overly skimped on the production quality despite the premium pricing.Save your money and buy a different DVD."
2,Terrible Background Music,"I have practised Tai Chi before and I know that the background music should be gentle and relaxing. So when I tried this DVD the first time, the intermittent sudden loud tune (or noise) in the background really struck me as unexpected and annoying. I couldn't focus on the excercises but kept wondering if it is the quality of the CD or it is the music itself.I like the content and the instructor but the music is odd and terrible."
3,a little dissapointing,"I ordered this book a few years ago and only now getting around to reading it, perhaps the book is showing its age! I'm finding the quotes and references for other reading more useful than the actual content. I'm about halfway through, a lot is not applicable to my situation, so skipping chapters. A little predictable and conservative for me. Halfway through, and not finding a lot of new material. I'm 68, happily married and fit, (blessing) so found a lot more inspiration and interesting content in Younger Next Year for Women."
2,Lacks enough explanation for installation,"Once installation is complete, configuring KDE is not a difficult task. The problem for most newbies is installation. I believe that the book fails in this regard. For example, the description for setting up the modem (for internet connection) is convered in a few pages. Most probably people cannot connect to the internet since many ISPs won't accept the default script."
3,Worthwhile to rent,"My favorite moments in this film are the seals, the penguins, and the people swimming inside the water of the interior of a glacier. The penguins are really cute, and the seals are amazing, the way they let people come right up to them.I don't know enough about Antarctica to comment as to whether it has been presented fairly in this film, and I've never seen another film on Antarctica to compare this one to."
3,Visually stunning but poorly directed,"The film quality is superb, and IMAX fans will not be disappointed in the cinematography. Overall, however, the film is unfocused and lacks direction. In addition, the music soundtrack and narration is surprisingly annoying and overdramatic. If you are interested in Antarctica, I recommend this film, but you might want to turn the sound off."
2,bad metal show,"This is bad. All the metal bands sound like one, and the same band. Black Sabbath's ""The Wizard"" is the song on the album. Ithink number two is Marilyn Manson's ""The love song"". The restis not listenable. I bought it only because I am a fan of BlackSabbath and Marilyn Manson."
3,Very erratic,I expected more from this. Very erratic and inconsistent. Makes it impossible for novice hitter to hit. It works better teaching kids how to catch pop ups.
5,"God, I love this game!","This is the main reaon I'm gonna buy a N64(and GoldenEye). Yes, I own a PS2 and a XBOX but this is one of my favorite games of all time. One downside though, it's extremely addictive. Like crack even. Well, maybe not crack but pretty addictive."
5,"Great, but only with friends . . .","This version of Tetris features a four-player head-to-head mode, which makes it great for parties. When you play, each line every player breaks counts towards revealing the ""wonders of the world,"" 3d fly-throughs of the great accomplishments of civilization. Oh, and the winning player gets credit for everyone else's lines, so there's some incentive to win.In single-player mode, it's just Tetris. Couple of different modes of gameplay, but Tetris nonetheless. If you enjoy the game you won't enjoy it more or less in this incarnation. It's the head-to-head that'll keep you and your buddies up all night.I don't know what planet the Amazon reviewer hails from, but the music on this is *terrible.* It's all herky-jerky techno, obnoxious and intrusive. We always turn the music off when we play."
5,The New Tetris or an addiction waiting to happen.,"It is very addictive. This game will cut you off from your friends, family, businesses, and any other pasttime. It you must purchase it, do so with care"
5,This is great!,"Tetris fans should know that this is the better version of Tetris for the Nintendo 64 if you were looking for the format closest to the original version. I've played it without instruction with little or no difficulty. looking back, comparing the original graphics to this one with it's updated, modern appearance it is one to add to your 64 treasured games. So needless to say any one who appreciates the original tetris will feel safe to purchase this version of Tetris. Thanks, Mary"
3,Ignore the previous two reviews,"I can't understand why someone that professes to despise rock and blues music would even buy this album, much less review it. Hooker is quintessential blues. It is simple and redundant and more about attitude than talent. If you don't understand blues - go buy a Lawrence Welk album. Leave John Lee Hooker to people that have some soul - we'll appreciate him even if you don't."
2,Poor Audio Performance and Poor Battery Life.....,"This unit has very poor audio in comparison to some higher-end units and it is most likely due to the size and type of speaker used in the unit because when I used an external speaker-mike the audio was much better. As for the the battery life...It is a weird thing. Midland had the right idea to shut of the LED display while on a single channel, which definetly improves battery life, but when the unit is scanning the display stays on. As for the durability of the unit, it is fairly obvious that the battery door on the back of the unit is a very poor design and comes open accidently. In general, I would have to say that it's worth spending a few more dollars and buying something half-decent."
4,Keeping in touch,We really enjoy having 2 of these. They have good clear sound and have come in handy alot of times. Especially when we are traveling or fishing. And when we are following each other on the highway it is alot cheaper to use these then our cell phones.
3,"Scary, but somewhat interesting.","Follow this book and you'll probably wind up with pee that really stings. Nonethess, it's a good resource if you're looking to spend your vacations getting laid (bring your cash though, it'll cost ya). For those looking to have fun and not necessarily pay for sex, I really liked DIE HAPPY: 499 THINGS EVERY GUYS GOTTA DO WHILE HE STILL CAN... very funny and filled with tons of fun travels, adventures and other good times."
4,A must own,"I bought this guide on referral from a former running buddy of mine. After 3 trips I can tell you it is spot on accurate, extremely funny, and points you towards everything a single guy wants to do in a hurry.Written for guys who love casinos, ocean fishing, exotic golf courses, and umbrellas drinks shared with hotties on the beach. Some of the most kicking party cities in the world, with a lot of cities you probably have never heard of. While you're at it, pick up a copy of his new book; it's flat out the funniest thing ever written.High Heels and Dirty Deals - Globetrotting Tales of Debauchery from a Binge-drinking Nymphomaniac"
5,car detailing from A to Z,"This book is a little gem.It includes a lot of information about car models detailing. The book starts from the needed tools, and includes concise but good description of the systems on a car (engine, electric, brakes, etc.).Then it includes tips for detailing of the engine, exteriors, interiors, chassis, wheels, etc., together with photos of both models in construction and finished ones."
3,Good information,"I cut my teeth on SAR with this text. It was not altogether painless. Franceshetti and Lanari have a bad habit of not defining variables once declared, or even telling what they are and mean until up to 127 pages later. If you pay close attention you'll stumble across their definition. The theory is well suited for those who know SAR and can appreciate the author's transfer function emphasis. The accomplishments and contributions of both authors are not in doubt (they have published many papers on the subject) but clarity of phenomena is wonting here. Part of this is due to the abstract nature of this subject and my early entry to it by what is a lovely text with supreme SAR imagery. Most thankfully, at the end we find software code is included to clarify, converting theory to practice and defining some of those variables."
2,Duh,"Sorry, after watching this film I became too ""brain dead"" to come up with a title for this review. This film comes across as an adventure-comedy farce. It has some truly funny moments, but the humor doesn't leave you feeling good. It leaves you with more of the blush that one feels after having laughed at an off color joke. Not much about this film, the plot, the action, nor the punch lines is original."
4,Not That Bad......,I fould it to be very funny I mean sure that is no story but who cares it's fun to Jackson doing a comdey for once I mean okay the other actors suck but it does not stop this movie from being funny.I know that the movie has alot of crude hummor in it and I like that kind of stuff but for those of you who want a funny and clever movie then go look somewhere else but for those of you who want to have a good time then go out and buy The Man.
2,"Too much desk, not enough lap","This is a BIG lap desk! If you need a lot of space, get this one. However, it is a little too much desk for my 15"" laptop. Also, I never needed to use the light, so it gets in the way. Not to mention it makes my lap warm because the soft under cushion absorbs my natural body heat. A lap desk should keep a computer stable and cool, but it should also keep you from overheating too. Sadly, not recommended. :-("
2,Lapdesk,I have a small netbook and the pad would be better for a bigger laptop. I guess the name Lapdesk is appropriate.
4,second desk,"i am enjoying my desk however as i had seen a desk by the same manufacturer at a barnes and noble i thought i was purchasing the desk with an incline adjustment on the back. i did get the first desk as promised, but it came in with a broken bulb. it took me a few inquires to be able to locate a bulb. after i replaced the bulb the desk lamp itself did not work. i contacted amazon, and was helped with a pleasant experience on how to return it and get a new one sent very quickly. as this was the first time i had ordered anything from amazon, i was pleasently pleased with the process."
2,Quality product with a horrible taste.,"I have severe acid reflux which is eating my esophagus raw. I use aloe vera to help heal my esophagus. This aloe vera is quality aloe vera, I can feel releif after swallowing a serving. however the taste is so bitter and foul that I find myself avoiding my doses. It is cheap and the aloe vera is of high quality, so if you can get past the taste then its well worth your while. There are other brands out there that are better quality with pleasant tastes and not that much more expensive though."
3,A modest lamp for the money,"This is a simple light, which is ok, and it does what it is supposed to. It uses a standard bulb which is convenient. However, the clip is plastic and rough at the edges. I had to pad it before I put it on a wooden headboard to avoid scratching the wood. This is very cheap finishing - a soft pad would have avoided damage to objects it clips onto and would also help avoid slippage."
4,Staple for Breastfeeding Moms!,"I honestly don't know how our Mom's did without these things! These pillows position baby right in the perfect spot to feed. I have three! One for upstaies, one downstairs and my older son uses his for lounging. Great product!"
2,Didn't work for me. Total waste of money,Read all the rave reviews and decided to get this since I planned on breastfeeding my daughter and also because I was having a classical c-section and thought that this would help alleviate the pain on my abdomen when holding my newborn. Not sure who these boppy pillows were made for but if you're a larger person these do not fit comfortably around you. I was much more comfortable sitting in the glider with the baby propped on a pillow in my lap. Even now after 3 weeks I've given it another try and they still aren't comfortable for me and I've lost most of my baby weight.Amazon has a 365 return day policy so if you don't mind spending the money and giving it a try then go ahead but for me it was a waste of money.
3,Great item but not a color match,This is a wonderful product I would advise any new parent or grandparent to buy I have one myself for neck problems.The only problem I had with this product is the color didnt match the room from the color in the pic OTHER_WISE its a fantastic product the color is the reason I gave it a low rating
3,would be great except one thing-it flattens quickly,The Boppy would have 5 stars if the filling didn't flatten so quickly. My baby is four months and I'm already having to put a pillow under the Boppy for better support during nursing. (Sigh)
2,Too Fluffy,Everyone raved about the Boppy pillow but I found it too fluffy. I do like the cover that this one came with and wished I was able to keep just that. I ended up returning this product because it didn't make breastfeeding easier but more difficult. I did find a less fluffier one at Babies R Us which was more expensive. I prefer to buy everything from Amazon but I guess it was something I needed to actually touch and try first.
5,Best Feeding and Infant Support Pillow EVER!,We love these pillow so much we bought two!!! You can use them for easy feeding (breast of bottle) and also for infant support. You can prop your 1-4 month old up in the pillow for play time and when they get old they can even lay in it on their stomachs. The cover is easily removable (our little girl has spit up on it a few times) and washable. I highly recommend this product!!!
3,DIsappointed,"Did not like texture of the slipcover, and honestly, the boppy does not really help for breastfeeding. I constantly have to prop it up and readjust. I probably would like a My Brestfriend pillow, but did not want my baby to have her head on memory foam so much so I went with the Boppy. I still use it, but for awhile just used a pillow because it was just as effective (or ineffective). I give it three stars because I do use it all day. Just don't really think it's that useful!"
2,disappointing,"I purchased this as a gift, and it turned out that the recipient already had one, so I kept it as a back-up to my Kitchenaid grinder. Fortunately Kitchenaid has a lifetime warranty, so I'd only be relying on this thing for a few weeks at a time, but MAN I hope my Kitchenaid doesn't break! This thing is terrible - uneven grind, tons of small parts to get beans stuck in, cord that's wrapped so tightly under the base that it's hard to tell if you're unwrapping it or pulling it off of the machine. Awful. I'm soooo glad I didn't end up giving it as a gift! Spring the extra $20 and get a Kitchenaid or another quality grinder."
3,Not very good for coarse grind,I like that it's got detachable parts for easy cleaning. The price is good and it's reasonably attractive. I bought it mainly for coarse grounds for my french press--it's not particularly good for that. The coarse setting produces grounds that are a little too fine and not very consistent.
1,Buy Something Else,"I hate this grinder. The cord is about a foot long so if there is anything in front of your outlet you have to move it to grind your coffee. The lid is fiddly and loaded with nooks and crannies that hold coffee grounds and spill them all over your counter when filling or emptying the cup. The ""Chamber Maid"" cleaning system does nothing useful, and the Coarse-Medium-Fine setting needs to be reset every time the device is unplugged."
3,over-engineered,Works OK once you figure out the interlocking parts. The automatic shutoff for various grinds and number of cups is rather unnecessary.
3,Love this - but it's not Sailor resistant,"This is the second grinder of this model that I've had. Actually, this one seems more solid and better built than my last one. What I like most about this is that the bowl is removable so I'm not tipping it upside down to transfer the coffee from the grinder to the coffee pot. I also like that it has a timer that shuts off the grinder when the grind has reached it's desired coarseness.<edit> I had my previous model for years and bought this because I liked it. Alas, I've had in onboard and in use for just over a month and someone has managed to break one of the tines on the chamber maid cleaning system. I had one of these break on my other one and everything still worked fine.Everything still works, it's just that the cleaning system really doesn't do a very good job of cleaning the grounds from the bowl and the tines for it are not very durable."
2,self cleaning arms broke,"I do not recommend this grinder. The self cleaning ""chamber"" feature is great, but after a couple of months of use, the plastic arms broke, up at the top where they ""tee"" with the circular ring. What this translates to is a lot of fiddly work to get it back together after washing it. It's so bad I rarely wash it now, and I am -- yet again -- researching for a new coffee grinder. Sigh."
2,Some major flaws,"Well, first, this thing is REALLY loud. I know by virtue of what this is that it is noisy but I usually grind at night which defeats the purpose, so as not to wake up a sleeping hubby. Second, it is a giant pain to get the coffee out of the thing without getting the spoon caught on the blade at the bottom. The turn to clean thing works ok but there are so many steps to get it off the base and the top always flies open and flings coffee everywhere. I do think it works well, you can grind for the right number of cups to get the perfect grind and it has a buil in timer but I will definately replace it with something different when I buy the next one."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I was excited to receive my Mr. Coffee electric grinder for Christmas. I've used it 10 or 15 times and this morning it broke. The blade will not spin and the motor smells hot. Nothing appears to be blocking or broken from the outside. Also, you are supposed to be able to pull the cord out, but try as hard as I can pull...I can barely reach the outlet with my cord without tipping the grinder over. It was such a fancy, pretty grinder that worked good the first 10 or 15 cups of coffee... =("
2,"Worked great while it lasted, motor died in 2 years","Worked great while it lasted, motor died in 2 years. I used to grind spices 2-3 times a week for 2 years. Since then bought a Cuisinart SG-10 Electric Spice-and-Nut Grinder. The Cuisinart takes alot longer to grind some spices (can take 1-2 minutes for cumin or cardamom), whereas the Mr Coffee ground anything very quickly."
2,imperfect cheap,"what not to like?1. grinds inconsistant2. fragile plastic housing will be a breakable problem.3. cord is short and leaves no flexiblity of where to locate4. must put correct amount of beans in every time that makes grindera nuiance if using more than once a day.5. must hold button, no autotimer, for grind that causes overgrinding or undergrinding and rarely perfectgrind.Advice: spend a little more and achieve greater satisfaction."
3,"Good, but not as good as the last model","This is the same product I purchased from a store several years ago and was excited to find it here. It is still a good grinder but where the last one had blades that actually cut the beans the proper way, this one has blunt blades that just bludgeon the beans and it often leaves large pieces of coffee bean even on the finest setting run more than once. This one will do until I find a new one."
4,Works Great,Have been using this Coffee Grinder for a while now and it works fine.Does just what it is suppose to do and very well .
4,Mr. Coffee Electric Coffee Grinder IDS77,"The Mr. Coffee Model IDS77 arrived promptly from Amazon and works great.Its a little noisy, but does what its suppose to.I would like to see the twist on and twist off alignment markingssomewhat larger for us senior citizens.The Chamber Maid does help, but I also use a small brush to grabwhat the Maid does not pick up, especially within the lid.Overall, I am happy with this unit."
4,Good for the price,"I needed a grinder that would hold enough for a full pot of coffee and that wouldn't be messy. This fits the bill. I like the way the top comes off and has a spout to pour the grounds. The 'cleaning' system is a nice touch, too.I would recommend it."
2,Coffee bean smasher.,It does what it is supposed to do.Don't even think about using it for French Press.
2,No Way to Accurately Measure,"I love the fine grind which works better than any grinder I've ever had, but there's no way to be accurate about how many beans to use.My old GE grinder would stop grinding beans at the appropriate amount you set. So if you put in too many beans, that unit knew when to stop and hold the remaining beans for the next use while letting you remove the cup of grinds to put in your coffeemaker. This Mr. Coffee machine doesn't do that as the same cup is used for the beans pre- and post-grinding."
2,I Don't Like Mr. Coffee IDS75 Coffee Grinder,"I have received the grinder and tried it out twice, and that will be all. I'm going back to my Krups coffee grinder. The Mr. Coffee grinder failed to grind all of the beans after filling it to the prescribed level and selecting the maximum grinding time. It left whole, unground beans after grinding. Although I have only used it twice, I ran 8 or 10 loads of beans through it with the same result. Also, the promised easy clean up is not any easier than my Krups grinder. I was not happy with this purchase."
1,"Loud, wimpy, and unnecessarily complicated. We retired it and bought a Krups","This grinder looked like a good idea on the web but proved to be a poor purchase. It works, but as noted above, it is loud, under powered, and complicated. It also has a very short power cord, which proved to be a nuisance. The capacity is bit less than we need for our morning Joe, and the time needed to grind the beans is longer than it needs to be. Buy a Krups for a simple, strong, efficient grinder."
1,Chamber Cleaning System,"My husband purchased this product for my birthday a couple of years ago. I always grind my own coffee for breakfast and sometimes grind it for lunch. After a year I noticed the plastic arms (or scrapers) were getting very thin and one of them had even broken. I emailed customer service about the problem and they sent me a new grinding bowl. I looked at the new bowl, saw the arms were thick and thought the company had realized there was a design flaw and changed it. I began using the new grinding bowl and now it is a year later. I just noticed that the plastic arms are getting thin again. This could only mean that this grinder slowly grinds the plastic arms. And that you are drinking very finely ground plastic every time you drink a cup of coffee made from the beans you have freshly ground. Is this healthy? I think not!"
3,Ok Grinder,"It still works but about 4 months the scraper broke inside the machine, so you have to use a spoon to get the grounds out now"
2,Bad grinder,"I will keep this short. I have found the same issues as many here have pointed out. The sweep arms don't work well and only serve to get in the way of cleaning with a brush. The cord windup feature is a stunt in itself and isn't worth the effort. The grind is inconsistent - even for a blade-type grinder. The alignment to close the lid can be a pain. And my newest problem with this grinder is that the plastic chamber deforms after a while and the lid tracks don't hold tight anymore. I have to twist-latch the lid and then hold it tight to ensure it doesn't slip off. In fairness, the grinder has worked to grind coffee every morning for about 6 months with no issues outside of the over-thought under-executed engineering. This was an emergency replacement for my previous grinder, but I can already see myself buying another grinder very soon; a pity, considering the motor, selectors, and timer all seem to be fine."
3,Grind is not consistent,"It's easy to use. The timing system helps.But the grind is just not consistent. Course grind for french press will have big and small coffee bits. Same with a finer espresso grind. If you really care about your coffee, this won't give you the best grind results."
1,Disappointed,"I initially thought grinder worked well. I liked ability to wash grinding chamber. However, after 1-2 weeks my coffee maker started to backup and get clogged. I first thought it was my coffee maker but realized the grinder produces a fine powder even on medium setting. This powder clogs the filter and you end up with a big mess and risk damaging your coffee maker.I am going back to my previous grinder made by Cappresso. Don't waste your time with this grinder."
4,Not the same old grind...,"I am what you'd call a coffee snob. I purchase my beans green and roast them myself. I've spent quite a bit of money getting just the right roaster. So, when I started looking for a new grinder to replace my old one, I was prepared to pay a fair amount for one. But, after lots of reading reviews and research, I settled for this inexpensive little guy. I have had it a month now and am very pleased with it. It has settings for the amount of beans you are grinding along with the type of grind you want(coarse, medium, fine). I have been very pleased with the job it does and it's definitely a good buy for the money!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought this electric coffee grinder, because it was the only other choice in WalMart, besides the coffee grinder I had that had just died.The lid is a royal pain in the neck to fit back on to the main compartment! The chamber maid system broke off! I had to throw the cleaning system out, after using the coffee grinder for only a couple of months!The 15 second timed grind isn't fine enough for my taste, either.All in all, I will never buy this grinder again, and from the looks of the reviews, I only have 10 more months left before it goes, too."
2,Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Grinder,This is our Second replacement....Luckly both were under warranty..My HONEST opinion ....Look for something else made of a BETTER QUALITY !!!Again don't waste your $$$$....
2,its ok for backup,I used this about 5 to 6 months then it stop working and the inside plastic piece broke that is suppose to clean the basket.I used it everyday for coffee and it worked fine until it started having problems to power on.I will be trying something different. will not replace with this model again.
1,No recommendation from me,"The price is a little too high on this coffee grinder, they should pay you. The power is minimal,grinding bowl too small, the cord is too short. Need I say more??"
2,Not So Good - Broke!,I bought this grinder for my wife and we use it about 2 times a week. I worked fine for about a year then the plastic guards inside the bowl broke. Now the lid won't fit and it doens't work. Be wary of this one unless you want to buy another one next year.
2,Take it back if you have a normal kitchen,"The box descriptions sound impressive and the price is right, but if you have cabinets hung over your counters and outlets in the wall under there, you're out of luck.The cord is so short, you'll be grinding beans at arms' length, hoping you don't bop your head on the cabinets. The instructions say it's a safety feature, but it's an annoyance.We have a cooking island counter in the kitchen, and can't use it. The cord won't reach from the outlet to the countertop unless we have the grinder perched on the very edge. An extension cord would be silly and hazardous in the kitchen.So, take it back and get another brand. Check the cord length before purchasing. The display models all had their cords cut off, so we ended up opening a taped package to check the Black and DEcker replacement we selected. But we were buying it, so no harm, no foul."
3,Disturbing Book,"There are some very tender, incredible tales in this book but there are some deeply, dark disturbing stories also. The writers prose wins all around. However, this book is not for everyone."
4,Esbjorn is an originality.,"This cd is good enough to make me feel "" i want to listen to thier music more"". I don't want to judge musicsians from just one cd. CDs are just a part of their musical activity. But i can tell how i felt. Esbjorn's compostions of this cd are highly attractive. ""Dodge the dodo"" is memorable and vampish but has much excitement. Some lyrical tunes like ""Pavane"",""From Gagarin's..."" or ""Chapel"" make haunting atmosphere.Someone who have listened to only thier studio-making cds should go to thier concert or listen to thier live on the radio (on a belgian radio, i listened the live in which E.S.T collaborated with Pat Metheny) or good live album EST 95. While in this cd there is little space of improvisation, Esbjorn's sence of piano improv highlighted more on thier lives is mezmerizing and moving. He is an original voice on the scene."
5,The Best RPG for Playstation Today,"This game is great because of the almost unlimited creation possibilities and also, the difficulty is emense. The 108 endings don't hurt either. If you need a game that will keep you entertained for a while and is fun, then get this one"
4,An Original Game,"This game has an interesting plot, unique game play, but sometimes the bosses are so powerful, you have to go to a previously saved level and do some major level building.The FMV's are great but there aren't too many.Private Actions are awesome and there's a wide variety of characters to chose to be in your party. Overall, a good challenge and must have for determined diehard RPG fans!"
4,"great game, too short","First off, i loved this game, yet i feel sort of decieved, ive been reading previews and reviews for months now, all of which claim that this game features 10 levels, from pearl harbor to a philippine pow camp. I have beat this game already and i count 9 levels. The pow camp level which every preview website speaks of simply doesnt seem to exist, unless its a secret level to be unlocked? If anybody has also found this ackward please let me know because maybe im missing something here."
2,Ground Truth,"This is my first review ever and the fact that I felt compelled to write one after a year and a half of ownership should give credit. Bottom Line: EA dropped the ball. I really don't know how anyone could give this game 5 or even 4 stars. I routinely hit glitches in the game that forced me to restart. The AI is WEAK. Very little exploration and overall too frustrating. There are several times that if you are not in the right place at the right time, the game freezes. Hidden passages won't open or the controls lock and you can't move forward.One thing that is also starting to bug me is when game designers have to ""dumb down"" a game. What I mean is the graphics and details should have been leaps and bounds above what they were. But since the PS2 has to be able to play the game, voila. Dumbed down.EA owes everyone who bought this game and expected it to be like `Frontline' an apology and a free exchange for a `Rising Sun 2, The Improvement'."
2,OK,I got this game for my birthday I was so excited.This game is not particulary fun graphics are not theat great I am on midnight raid its impossible to tell where people are shooting from buy something else.
2,"VERY, VERY , VERY SHORT + EASY","I have loved MOH since the first PS1 version so it was with shock and anger that I watched the credits roll after what I thought was about half of the game. Way too short, way too easy, graphics OK but the whole thing has the feel of an expansion pack not a $50.00 game. This does feel like an absolute xmas rush job by - congrats EA you got the thing out for christmas but you've soured some of your best customers."
4,Should be read by all with an interest in the social sciences,"McIntyre calls for a revolution in the social sciences - it should be more like the physical sciences, with religious and political biases put aside for dispassionate research to discover the true answers to why people behave the way they do. An important argument, but McIntyre resorts to practically calling those who disagree names: ""Are they afraid that a science of human behavior would somehow dehumanize us, and are they therefore motivated to find an argument against it?"" Nyah, nyah, nyah. He is also somewhat repetitive. Despite these reservations, his case is persuasive, and the book is worth a read by anyone interested in the topic or working in the field of the social sciences."
4,For Violin Lovers,"I absolutely love this CD. Very relaxing. The violin is one of my favorite instruments. I taught myself to listen and appreciate classical music, by just buying music of my favorite instruments; that may not be the smartest way to do it, but it worked for me. This CD has many of the standard favorites."
1,Camp Blood Trilogy,"Oh my NO! I don't want to tell anyone what they should or should not watch but these movies are HORRIBLE. I enjoy ALL horror movies from any decade whether they be A or B with a real camera crew or someone following want to be actors around with a camcorder. These movies, no - there is no thrill, no suspense, no laughability factors, no hot topless or naked chicks running around. The so called gore is ridiculous but not in a good way. Reading other reviews I was led to believe that these movies were wonderful and if you were a horror movie fan than they were for you. Please I think someone is playing a mean joke on everyone. If you can stay away. PEW!"
2,worst clown ever,Camp blood is shot with what seems like a camcorder really shacky and bad dialog but it was worth wachen it was funny havent wached the 3rd but i bet its just as bad but the 1st was so bad idk how they got 2 sequles made is beyond me o well if you got some extra cash its a ok movie to buy and watch if you like films like the blare witch project
4,Great tips but too racing-focused,"I enjoyed several of the earlier sections focused on fundamental and skills and have applied the major lesson, ""light hands, heavy feet,"" to all of my biking. However, later parts of the book focus on racing and advanced technique, which, for the average rider, is meaningless."
5,Lovely little flat,"I ordered these this week and immediately put them on when they arrived. They are heaven for my feet. The fit is true to size, too. I got the black patent version, which is so right at the moment. The detailing makes for one adorable shoe. This is the perfect shoe to add a little bit of quirky coolness to an overall conservative outfit."
1,Don't buy this item just from the outlook,"If you want to buy this item is because of the wood like outlook, please forget about it. Because this furniture is totally made by recycle wood, only the front side has wood-like skin. Look inside you would see ugly surface of recycle wood. And the worst part is that drawer is extremely weak. The bottom of the drawer is made of 3 mm thick only recycle paper, it is as thin as a paper and the depth of drawer is only 10 cm. You are not allowed to put much clothes or item inside the drawer, otherwise it will crash.Beside the worst drawer, the structure of the dresser is not stable as well. After you finish installation, the whole dresser keeps swing. Therefore, you can see the dresser may fall down warning in the first page of installation manual. Overall, this is very poor quality furniture. Don't be fool by the front side wood-like skin. It is worse than any furniture you can buy in the Wal-Mart or target. Don't buy it absolutely."
4,GREAT CUP OF COFFEE FAST!!!,I RECEIVED THIS COFFEE MAKER FOR CHRISTMAS AND LOVE IT. IT MAKES THE BEST CUP OF COFFEE I EVER HAD AND IT IS HOT! AFTER YOU TURN IT ON IT TAKES A FEW SECONDS AND IS READY TO BREW. YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF ONE OR 2 CUPS OF 3 DIFFERENT SIZES. IT IS ALWAYS FRESH. THE PODS ARE A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE WASTED COFFEE THAT GETS THROWN OUT IT ISN'T BAD. YOU CAN HAVE A FRESH CUP IN THE MORNING AND GRAB ANOTHER FRESH CUP GOING OUT THE DOOR! IT ALSO CAN MAKE LATTES. MY ONLY COMPLAINT THE STEAM AT THE END SPLASHES THE COUNTER A LITTLE AND THE WATER TANK IS IN THE BACK AND I HAVE TO TURN IT TO SEE IF IT NEEDS FILLING. IT IS SIMPLE TO LIFT OUT AND FILL. OVERALL IT IS A GREAT POT. BUY IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT.
1,disappointed,"Bulky, no coffee foam, expensive for value received, inflexible in that you cannot make one or two cups of expresso only.returned it for refund."
3,Easy to use,"Bought this for Christmas for my wife. My office-sharing neighbor has the Keurig and I love the convenience of the coffee maker and the quality of the coffee (use various Green Mtn selections). I almost took the Krups back. Not because it did not work but because the coffee was AWFUL - the Millstone Colombian Supremo that came with the unit. I made a cup, tasted it, then poured it out and also threw out the 15 un-used pods. My unit has the stubborn latch noted by other reviewers. But I'm ordering some better coffee and counting on the next cup being much better: it's easy to use and ought to make a good cup of coffee."
2,So-so,"I am going to go against the majority of reviews here.I have a Senseo at home, and we have the Home Cafe at work. I use both almost daily.This machine does have good sides:- Larger water tank- Multiple cup size selection- A higher clearance between the brew and the cup, so you can fit various size mugs/cups under the spout- Latte setting, and a ""special"" pod holderOverall, I prefer the Senseo. It a consistent cup of coffee from the Senseo. The Home Cafe can give me a great cup one moment, and an extremely watery cup right after that.The Home Cafe also has some weird cleaning cycle during the end of brewing, where it will hiss, steam and spit and ends up making a mess of the counter."
1,design flaw,"When I opened the box and put my coffee maker together I noticed that the double pod holder could not be used. When I tried to close the lid to seal the coffee pods for brewing, the lid did not cover the pods, so I was unable to latch and seal for brewing. I kept the coffee maker and only use it for single pod making because I paid very little for the unit and really that is all I need for right now."
1,what a POS,"I recently recieved this machine back from my mother in law, she couldn't get the pod holders to fit, well turns out after i looked at it they had to pack the wrong pod holders, and after reading some comments I see that I'm not the only one who got a KRAP KP1010, even when I used the right set it spewed water all over, just left complaint e-mail, but from what I've been reading, good luck to me!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited to receive the Krups 1010. It looked good and solid and I liked that it made 2 cups at a time and had a water filter. Unfortunately, the coffee it made was so disappointing I ended up returning it. Since it only holds single pods (no double Pod holder), I couldn't get coffee to be more than watery. The coffee was too thin to add cream, even for the smaller cup size. I tried several brands of pods before I gave up. The other problem was the coffee was not consistently hot. I took my pods to a friend who purchased the new Mr. Coffee Single Serve and the same pods came out stronger, thicker and hotter. I guess this proves looks aren't everything."
4,Near Perfect,"I've had this coffee maker for what seems to be a few months... and I haven't had any real problems. The Homecafe pods are pretty good, but I'm not really a coffee expert -- I just need coffee, be it from a gas station or whatever. Anyway, it works smoothly, except it sprays a bit near the end to clear itself out... this would be fine if the spray was localized. It's not too bad though, just wipe the counter off every few days."
2,Not satisfied with this product,"It looks like original nikon battery pack, but technically it has fault. When I have used with my two fully charged Nikon EN-EL3e batteries, it gave me only couple of hour, after that it shows battery low signal at my D200 display panel.I have tried to use 6 X AA batteries, but they are pathetic.I am not at all satisfied with this product."
4,Mediocre,"I thought that other than the D & D inspired artwork, this is a mediocre CD and I wouldn't recomend it."
4,Molly Hatchet - Decent Hits Collection But Far From Complete,"This is a decent hits collection of Hatchet's studio output up to 1990. All of the band's most popular songs are here, but it is far from complete. The album only represents tracks from 4 of Hatchet's albums and I think they have at least 10 or more releases. If you are just looking for a strict greatest hits disc this is a decent collection, but if you are looking for an overview of the band I would recommend the live Double Trouble Live as a better representation. Most of the tracks here are also on the live album, plus some additional material from later in their career. There are also two new (at the time) songs on this collection, Shake The House Down, and Ragtop Deluxe, neither of which are anything spectacular."
3,It's not too bad,This book was needed for a class however I actually found this textbook to be an easy read the information is not only informative but I causes you to think as well!
1,Misleading add,"This item is boots only ! The illustration shows both switch and boots, and implies a choice of color. The title includes mention of both as if included as shown. It MEANS boots for...., only."
2,Not very exciting,"This was the first Heather Graham book I read. I didn't care for it very much. In fact, I was half way through and decided it was no longer worth my time. I think there's potential for me to like the author....just not this book. The reasons for the antagonism between the two main characters was stupid. They were fighting over really dumb things. I love history and romance and lived in Florida for awhile so it looked like a good book.I've ordered a couple other of the author's books because I see the potential for good writing. I hope I like them."
1,Defective Zipper,"Don't let the low price influence your purchase. You get what you pay for!! My Coleman backpack zipper broke on my first attempted use. Coleman Warranty Service was no help since I didn't buy it from a Brick and Mortar store. There is a big reason why these are selling so cheap, ""They are Cheaply Made"". I will never purchase Coleman products again!!!!"
1,not worth the price.,"The problems i have with this item are: the lock dont work properly, the handles are not comfortable, the case is too big,nothing is secured inside as for example your pens or pencils will be broken because of the bad design, your usb drives will be lost because briefcase has two unsecured opening on left and right and even computer inside is not possible to secure.bad design overall."
4,Brief case,I really liked it. It is the perfect size. It could use little feet at the bottom. Good quality material.
3,Less than expected,"Flimsier than I expected, but I suppose that's what you get for such a low price."
5,best book of the kind I've read!!,"If you read the book with an open mind yet objective it's a great awareness tool. It put a lot of my thoughts and feelings into clear words, but also had scenarios that didn't apply to me. My parents divorced 2 years ago when I was a senior in high school so it didn't completely apply to my case because the cases in the book are 16 years and younger at time of the divorce. I learned a lot and it has been a great tool for me.Ps I loved this book because it gave me strategies on hold to cope and fix my problems"
4,Fabrics Guide by Marypaul Yates,"A very nice book, quite in depth.Covers natural and man made fibers, types of weaves, production and fabric finishes. Many color plate examples to illustrate the information.This book was shipped quickly by Amason at half the price I paid at the campus bookstore! Needless to say, I returned the book purchased at the campus bookstore."
1,??,"I've been thinking about buying this book, but I always like to look inside before making my purchase... Something tells me the content displayed on the ""Look Inside"" link has nothing to do with this book... Could someone please confirm this...?"
3,A lot of stuff from Delphi 2 in 21 days.,"This is not a good deal to those who already have Delphi 2 in 21 days. The new features in Delphi 3 are well explored but there are few new approachs to the old subjects. However, if you're looking for a book to get started in Delphi you should consider this one."
2,Teach Yourself Delphi 3 in 14 Days,"Teach Yourself Delphi 3 in 14 Days does a great injustice to an otherwise excellent programming language. On almost every page there is a glaring grammatical or spelling error that should've been caught by the editor. In addition, the authors describe features without letting the reader know which version they are describing. However, the book does introduce some key programming concepts and practices. Even though the book comes packaged with the Delphi 3 Standard edition, I would recommend choosing another text from which to learn Delphi 3."
2,"Starts good, but goes downhill","I ignored previous reviews about the incorrect examples, based on my need to start somewhere. At first, this book was just what I needed. Errors in the Delphi examples were easy enough to figure out in the beginning of the book, but became impossible for me when things got more complicated. It made me frustrated and spoiled the experience."
2,Good for the Case and Batteries Only,"I purchased the DeWalt DC550KA about two years ago when I needed to make several circuit box cut-outs in drywall during a kitchen renovation. I was swayed by the initial positive reviews, the brand, its portability over the Rotozip, and that it complemented my other existing DeWalt 18V tools.My first use on a box cut-out was very disappointing. It had plenty of power and speed but quickly spent one battery before I could complete the entire cut. Other attempts yielded similar results with other charged batteries.I was not going to post a review but felt compelled when it was receiving so many favorable one. Besides the poor run-time, the spindle lock was awkward and not well designed. Unlike most solidly designed and built DeWalt 18V tools, this tool is not designed for prolonged or rigorous use.I would only recommend this kit if you needed the extra batteries or the case (it fits the DeWalt DW960 right angle 18V drill, charger, and two batteries)."
1,Not for full time use,I purchased this tool to eliminate tripping over cords. While the balance and power is was fine at first the battery life was short. It would take me five minutes a sheet to do the cut outs and after a couple sheets the tool would be dead. After a month of using the tool on a regular basis the motor burned out. I then ordered Dewalts corded version and it's been working fine and we have been enjoying the extra power of the unit. If you are getting it just for remodeling where you'll just use it for a few cuts it will be an excellent tool and very handy without the cord. But anymore then that I would stick to the corded version.
4,This books has given me some great tips.,"I heard of Jama Clark on the radio, decided to pick up the book and have been happy with the results. I've been in the ""like a brother"", ""funny guy"", ""nice guy"" purgatory forever- with the help of some of this advice I am doing much better with the ladies. I've passed it to a few friends and they have enjoyed it as well. P.S. Women want a man, not a door mat."
1,This woman does not speak for ALL women.,"I have let several women read this book as well as men. They ALL say, Well, thats what she likes2. Everyone has an opinion and this is hers. I have yet to hear anyone say that they agree with the author."
3,Broken tray,"This storage rack seems like a nice item, but like many other buyers, mine arrived with a broken tray! It is cracked and there is a big hole in the corner."
1,Sad,"I've only had this item for about 40 days, I've been using it for my training walks for the 3Day breast Cancer walk. It is already falling apart at the seam. My friend bought one at walmart for $10.00 and has had it for 2 years and it's still holding up. I guess I should have went to wal-mart to get mine."
5,"Everyone needs to read this, especially the president and his wife.","This is a woderfully written book. You are emotionally taken to the war zones and amongst these wonderfully brave young men and women who are trying their very best to serve our country. You feel the heat and cold, dirt and noise of the war and see the lack of support they must feel with the lack of properly outfitted equipment etc.It breaks my heart to think about all the goof ups, denial and greed that got us to this point."
5,"Tear-Jerking, best read of summer","This book was absolutely amazing. I am not a cryer and I ended up crying the last two chapters of this book. I have many friends in the military and support the troops no matter what. This book is for anyone, especially those who do not have a military connection. They will learn from this book and what it is really like to serve in the military and what it is like to be the families of military men and women. Great book and although I cried it was more than worth it. I have recommended this book to over 4 people who enjoyed it as much as I did and have recommended to friends of their own."
5,Gripping! Too much like you were there!,"A well-written, gripping telling of the hell our soldiers (and their families) experienced. I read it it two sittings!"
4,Must read!,"Regardless of how you feel about the war, every American should read this story. This is a story about bravery, valor, and the unbelievable heroism of our men and women in the armed forces. After reading this book, I have never been prouder to be an American. My personal belief is that this is the wrong war, and that these brave young men and women deserve the best support we can give them. They certainly are giving us 'their all'."
4,"It's a good, easy read, revealing uncertain conditions in an unpopular war.","Easy reading, yet emotionally moving description of conditions in an urban battle. Includes not just the soldiers, but the families in home bases thousands of miles away.Recommmended for anyone who is interested in Iraq war, pro or con, this book doesn't take sides, just describes and explains what happened in this particular situation in Baghdad."
5,nice,"These cost same in the stores as well. I trust the brand, so giving 5 stars for them.. recommended !"
3,Almost Only Counts In Horse Shoes,"I purchased this item to replace an existing Wright screen door handle set. In and of itself, the product is fine, and looks great installed. The problem I have with it however, is the manufacturer, Wright, produced a replacement product for their own product, that just misses with fit, and screw alignment. What appears at first glance, as an identical replacement, proves to miss the mark a little bit here with screw alignment, and just slightly there with hardware accommodation. I had to drill, file, and realign nearly every screw hole, which would have been AOK if the new holes needed to be far enough away from the original holes, but in every case, I needed to create new holes all too close to the original holes. Dangerous in terms of the risk of creating a wide gaping slot. In short, the product is fine, but, what should have been a 10-15 minute same-for-same swap out, instead, became a project. Annoying."
1,Short Lived Satisfaction,"Installed this lockset in July 2011 on the storm door of the Main Entrance. We did not use it much, since we park in the garage.On November 29,2011 my door stocked. I couldn't open it from either side and when I disassemble the lock I found broken latch.Is 5 month of service really awful for the lock? Or I'm asking too much. Contacted seller but no response yet."
5,great wrench,I work doing heavy mechanical service on factory equipment this is a great wrench to take off large filters its very light
2,"There are much, much better books on Rockwell than this one . . .","It's not always a popular position, but I'm a longtime fan of Norman Rockwell's highly representational style of illustration. (I generally prefer book and magazine illustrators to ""classic"" artists.) But I'm a bit puzzled why this book even exists. Some of the works illustrated are repeated with no explanation, some of those discussed at some length in the text are never illustrated at all, and the captions often misinterpret Rockwell's obvious (and long-recognized) themes or intentions. And there are more than a few typos and misspellings. If you want only one large pictorial treatment of Rockwell's seven decades of work, this ain't it. Instead, go with one of Thomas Buechner's several classic treatments from the 1970s, all of which have been reprinted several times -- and which Sonder himself even recommends."
5,What a Read!,"Michael Vaughn, what do we reall know about him? We know that he was Sidney's handler, and we know that he works for the CIA, but how much do we know about him as a person? This book really opens our eyes to the wonderful world of Vaughn. A few suprise twists really make the story.This book is an easy read and will be enjoyable to fans and non-fans alike. Happy reading!"
1,Updated: Was not worth buying,"Updated 2008 Review (Hope this new detailed review will be more helpful): I bought this DVD to help get back in shape post-pregnancy. Out of the many post-pregnancy exercise videos & DVDs that I purchased, this one was the least useful and least enjoyable. The DVD has a very cheaply & quickly produced feel to it. I did sit through this DVD once and attempted to follow the exercises. I have to admit that I questioned the safety of some of the baby/mother exercises. As I mentioned I have several baby/mother DVD exercise videos and this was the only one that I felt the exercises might pose some safety risk to my baby. Personally I feel there are much better DVDs available for post-pregnancy exercise so I have to rate this DVD as a total waste of my money."
2,"i tried, but it is not very good","its tough when you watch and work out to a video that has people leading that shouldn't be on film, this was a one time viewing that i cannot watch or try again"
5,Phoebe,I've always loved Phoebe and had her CDs and lost them in a fire. I'm so glad her voice will live in our memories forever.
3,"Not a long range ""Driving Beam"" pattern light","Nice little lights for the money but after putting 12v. to them, I discovered that the beam pattern is too diffused for the long range illumination I am seeking. It is more like a diffused flood/fog pattern with an X shaped hot spot in the center. If you want more of a medium range light (up to 100 yds.), these will work fine. Unfortunately, I had to modify the wiring harness to fit them to my MC so now I can't return them. I'll put them on *bay."
5,GREAT INVESTMENT FOR MEMORIES,"This was such a GREAT way to house all the school pictures of our baby girl (who is not such a baby anymore - she is 15)! It's amazing how she has changed with every year! She loves being able to see her Kindergarden picture and compare it to her freshman pic in high school. Love it love it! Great memory keepsake item at a GREAT price. Oh, forgot to mention, this is the size of about an 8X10 picture frame and can be hung on a wall or placed on a table just like a picture frame(the product has a picture frame backing)"
5,Wish there were 6 stars,"I was very afraid of this album, thinking it would be some phony, overproduced, over-hyped, yet-another ""comeback"" album. Believe me, it is not.I depended on Cat Stevens to deliver original, beautiful songs with poetic lyrics, spiritual depth and fantastic, creative arrangements. This album is all of that and more, as welcome a relief from the pop music of today as he was a breath of fresh air 30 years ago.One has to remember that Yusuf is an artist at heart, a striving and searching person. His albums were adventures in creativity. We took him at his word and followed his progress as if it were our own, and still can. I respected his decisions about religion and music because it took courage and honesty to walk away from the music business.This album is full of that courage, honesty, and most of all, artistic integrity. We need this, now, in our music scene."
2,A Study in Aging,"It might not be such a good idea that Amazon is selling An Other Cup along with The Best of Cat Stevens. The comparisons are inevitable. If you are looking for Cat Stevens, you will not find him in An Other Cup. Gone is the vigorous, forceful, rock and roll voice; the searching lyrics and staccato delivery. Instead, on An Other Cup you find a pleasant and melodious delivery of lyrics that reflect the complacency and self-asssuredness of middle age. Yusuf seems to have found his truth, love, and some degree of happiness, but it doesn't translate into universal themes that draw the listener in. More than anything, this CD is a study in aging.I wish he had done a remake of ""Father and Son"", with the now older Yusuf singing a duet with his younger Cat Stevens self. Now THAT would have been interesting!"
2,Sounds dated...,"I just heard Yusuf on NPR doing an acoustic set with a few songs from his new album. MUCH BETTER. Unfortunately, Yusuf needs a new producer. The album sounds horribly dated. Great lyrics though. It's a shame it wasn't just Cat and a guitar for this one."
5,The music is of excellence,"I loved this album, as if the story teller that is Cat Stevens was on a journey to find out, and now he's back to tell us what is it that he has found: An understanding of life that we all need in this day and age.Aside from the universal messages in the songs that anyone from any faith can relate to, the music is of excellence, in fact, i find it even better than some of the late 70's Cat Stevens music. It's not that often you get to witness a come-back of an artist with substance... this come-back surely is."
2,Zombie-ish,"I was very much looking forward to this release. As big fan starting back with ""Tea for the Tillerman"" loving all of the 1st 4 albums, having really enjoyed ""A is for Allah"", and even the little clips I heard of this new album sounded good. But,""An Other Cup"" is unlistenable.Lacking the simple pure devotional, genuine presence of ""A is for Allah"" and without the clever lyrics and heartfelt angst of Cat's early work.His voice is good, surprising solid, but these lyrics are so awful, so droll, boring, I will not be listening to this album for a long time, not until i forget how much of a waste it is."
3,"an another cup, yusuf (Cat Stevens)","Love Cat Stevens, glad he's back, I listened to the CD twice, a little to religious for me, very Muslim, with is fine, it could be any religion,I just don't want any religion in my music.The very best of cat stevens is great as usual.."
4,"Another Excellent ""Cat Stevens"" Album","I love almost all the songs on his new album. A couple are not as great, but still very good. He sounds like he always did. All the songs are filled with love and spiritual lyrics. His remake of the Animals song is fantastic too. Overall, an excellent album."
5,Fabulous return,"As an ardent Cat Stevens fan, I am so pleased with this new recording. The messages in the songs are lovely and his voice and music is as good as ever. hardly seems likely that I was listening to him 37 years ago! wow"
4,A rose is still a rose... a cat is still a cat,Don't be turned off by any of the bad press about Yusuf aka Cat Stevens. Same soul on a spiritual journey. Like catching up with an old friend. Some of the stories you will like better than others.
1,An Absolute Cat-astrophe,"As a lifelong Cat Stevens fan, I have spent the past two weeks listening to my Cat collection in preparation for this exciting release. Utter disappointment is all that awaits even a half-hearted fan. The lyrics are thinly veiled religious metaphors, the instrumentals are lethargic and simplistic and, at best, the vocals are weak and monotonous. The only aspect of this CD, which faintly resembles my beloved Cat, is the illustration in the liner notes which conjures memories of ""Buddha and the Chocolate Box."" As much as it pains me to write a negative review about one of my favorite musical artists, I have to let other fans know...set your expectations low, this one's going to hurt. Oh, and let's not forget the two tracks which are merely spoken word. If I wanted a spiritual revelation, I would shop in the New Age section! Do ""yusuf"" a favor, and skip this disappointing comeback."
4,Fun...but hard,I recently bought this game used.. and man was I happy!! You will first notice the great graphics. and you will also notice fun racing. Fun but not if you playnit a lot.7 out of 10
4,Tempo Van! Tempo!,"Van was only 26 or so, I'm not looking at the jacket liner, but this recording was done live in Moscow shortly after he had won the highest award given by that country for musicallity. It is the original version of Rach's sonata, which he later cut 120 bars of music. But Van, really! 120 bars of ""Allegro Agitato"" doesn't take an addition three and a half minutes. It's the ""Lento"" section you let drag out so long it just barely supports the exquisite melody of that section. The Etudes you played were great, Van, but that sonata was a little self indulgent, but then you were very young when you recorded it. Better luck next time."
3,So so,"For those who've already read ""The Courtship of Princess Leia,"" you alrady know the ending of this one. Han Solo seems to be out of character commanding a Mon Cal Cruiser. Even in ""Return of the Jedi"" he was doing covert stuff as a General. It seems that he would be more aptly placed within a group like Wraith Squadron were he could use his true talents. The battle segments in this book are a bit confusing - especially the last part about how Zsinj escapes."
4,Dang good for a formula book,"Aaron Allston has done a good job of taking up where Michael Stackpole left off. It seems hard to combine character development with shoot-em-up action, but Allston does a credible job with battle descriptions while faithfully preserving characters like Han Solo and further dimensioning Wraith Squadron members. There is no breaking of new ground here, but the usual sneaky Zsinj manuvering and some fine management by the Peter Drucker of the X-wing, Wedge Antilles. Betcha' can't put it down..."
3,For those starting to learn about the business,"This book provides basic inside into owning a restaurant. It gives a description of the many parts a reastaurateur has to tackle. It does not go into massive detail about the business, is more like an introduction about it. I recommend this book to people who are interested in starting a restaurant or small café but are just starting to learn about it (like me). For those who have some experience in the restaurant sector this book can be more like quick review. I gave it three stars because even though the book provided good info it didn't when into depth about the subject as i would like to. But in general is a good book to start to explore your options. (the updated edition)"
2,Monster dinosaur binocs,"These binoculars are huge and heavy, plus they have individually focused lenses instead of the center focus that most newer binoculars have. Maybe this is necessary to make an inexpensive, sealed binocular that will float and be waterproof, but it makes them very cumbersome to use. If you are considering these, make sure that you compare dimensions and weight to other alternatives or to binoculars that you already own. I ended up returning them as they were too big."
5,Excellent,"This is a must read for every young black male, and even female. I loved it! I brought for my 16 year old nephew and his close friends. I also brought a copy for myself to read along and ensure they were reading too."
5,a great message for young men,"This book was very, very well written. It has a positive message to young men. I would recommend it to any young person trying to come into their own."
3,Review From A Young Sister-Good,"For the record, I technically give this book 3.5 stars :)I find it to be a straightforward, easy read that can encourage and motivate young people in general, if read and discussed with a parent or respected adult. Hill Harper seems fairly open, honest and responsible in his approach to responding to various questions that plague the minds of young brothers. Sincerity, concern and confidence resonate throughout the book and allows us adults a chance to peek into the wonderfully complex yet fascinating world of young brothers growing up today. I can see 11-15 year olds benefitting from the examples, experiences and outlooks given in this book and I recommend sharing it."
5,Mother from Sun Prairie,"Brilliant! The little princess who did not want to clean her room ran off to join the rumpled street kids. Her experience which at first was liberating and fun became ugly and shameful to her. Her father the king quietly witnessed her disobedience and patiently waited for her to return home on her own.Upon her return he forgave her,cleaned her up and tucked her to bed. I have a four and seven year old and they both understood the message of the story. Every child should read this message of our Lord's forgiveness."
5,Awesome book!,"This is a fantastic book. The illustrations are truly amazing and the moral of the story is inspiring for young girls, boys and for adults! I will be purchasing this wonderful children's book for all of my friends who are expecting!"
3,"Dog loved it, but . . .","Dog loved it, but I think the part that she couldn't reach started to go bad and had to throw it out."
1,how come,how come this is listed at $88.40?how come its so small?how come i got the wrong flavor? my dog don't care but come on.
2,"High expectations, low satisfaction.","I have to admit I was disappointed in this book. I ordered it because I knew the author, Harvey C. Parker was involved in CHADD, a support group for parents of children with ADD. This book does a good job covering the basics, but if you are already an educated parent about ADD and strategies, it offers nothing new or advanced. I'd say this book might be helpful for a parent who has a child aged 4-6, and who knows very little about ADD. The sticker charts in the book are definitely geared toward younger children. One example: there is a ""Good Bedtime Behavior"" chart with a picture of a bed with a teddy bear on it. There are ten circles on the headboard/footboard of the bed to put stickers on for behaving at bedtime. Definitely not for my ten year old boy!"
2,breaks down fast,"I wanted to love this unit. Filtratrion/price was excellent by the books. But first, the green light that's supposed to change to red when it's time to change the filter never did anything but blink green. Then the automatic return to unfiltered water switch stopped working, but that was OK to switch back and forth manually. Then, the cartridges didn't last as long as they were supposed to - beware the expensive razor blade. Finally, the thing started spewing little streams of pressurized water out the back and sides of the cartidge. Hope I can find a decent unit elsewhere, I'm done with this one. It did do a good job of filtering the water though."
3,Not enough moisture,"The ingredient list showed many oils in the product, but was still not leaving any moist feeling on my 53 yr old skin.The oils must be miniscule amounts. Maybe for a younger woman or a warm climate, certainly a not winter product."
3,Good way to start with Lightwave,"I got Backgrounds in Motion vol 1 & 2 a couple days ago. I really think that the contents on both volumes could have been condensed into only one. If you want to get them but due to your budget you only can get one I recommend to get Vol 1.Both volumes are pretty similar, I think they've could covered many other topics or at least experimented more in different ways.Vol 1 talks mainly about particle effects (volumetrics)Vol 2 talks about procedural textures (which is even more of a begginers topic)both volumes go thru very similar examples. If you are a begginer with lightwave and have the money to get Background in motion I would recommend them for people that would like to work with Broadcast animation."
2,Hard to keep reading,This book was nothing like the first. It was really hard to keep reading because I was so bored. I made it through trying to see if maybe it got better by the end. No luck...
2,Not as great as I remembered,"I agree with the reveiw that says this toy is for nostalgia purposes only. This is the Snoopy snow cone maker we had as kids ourselves, so it's fun to see our kids now playing with it. BUT, it's really difficult to use - you need major muscle power to grind the ice into ""snow."" The plastic this toy is made of is super thin, so you constantly feel like the thing is going to break, especially given all the pressure you have to exert to get the snow to come out. Overall, this toy was fun to use once, but I doubt we'll be pulling it out of the closet too often."
1,They have taken a fond memory and made it into JUNK,I to was soooo excited when I saw this. My kids thought I was nuts but I HAD to buy it lol. I explained how I had one and what fun it was. Got home and tried to make a sno-cone. The handle kept popping off and I got maybe a tablespoon of sno after a TON of cranking. The culprit? Well from looking it over in the name of safety there is a TON of plastic guards on the wheel thing and they seem to have dulled the wheel blades and made the shaves a lot shallower. Sure safer but now it doesn't work. Sometimes this PC make everything super safe stuff is really annoying. what ever happened to good old parent supervision?
2,"Oww, my arm hurts!","I had this when I was little, but I think they've changed it a bit!I'm obviously stronger than when I was a little child, but I think they made the blades on this one duller. You have to crank what seems like forever just to get a little ""snow"" out. By the time you have enough to shovel out, the bottom has already melted. I could not get a single one done, even after 15 minutes of cranking. All four kids (my kids had two playmates over) were quite disappointed, because all they got was a spoonful each.My arm was sore for a whole day after, just from getting four kids a spoonful.I don't remember it being this difficult when I was a kid. I remember making my own snowcones without much problem. I think since then, they've dulled the blades, perhaps out of safety concerns. I'm all for safety, but whatever they did, it renders the machine useless."
3,Good screen ...pull down mechanism not easy to use,The image is good and size is what I expectedInstallation was easy.The screen is well designed to support different kind of installations.The only bad note is that it takes some time to fold the screen back.
4,Great Screen for the Money!,"This is an awesome screen. Came in a very nicely packed box, no damage, ready to use. I had it up in minutes. There was a chemical smell, but I left it pulled out for a few days and it dissapated."
3,OK - quick fun read,"This was a fun / quick read. Nothing too earth shattering. I enjoyed the characters of Julia and Nikolai and the basic development of their mating / bonding. But they both seemed a little naive to me. I have now read the first and second in this series, but do not find the other titles under this author or by trying to bring up Moon Lust. 206 pages."
3,A good introduction,"The book is well written but it is not for those who have read a lot on evolution. It is a good beginners book not a good book for new insights. His examples are not new and the evolution of speed in the antelope is overused. The best point of the book is that there is no evidence, yet, for choosing between Dawkins and his fellows and Gould and his. I think they are talking past each other."
1,Popular science writing?,"The Evolutionists is an endlessly repetitive, poorly organized book, replete with spelling and grammatical errors. Worse, it is an uninspired introduction to a fascinating and important topic. Morris appears to have expended as little effort as possible researching this book, and evinces only a facile understanding of the issues he engages. The Evolutionsists reads like a third-rate middle school book report. It's about 5 pages of content morphed into 200+ pages of text (how many times can Morris report exactly the same findings about stickleback fish? I lost count...). Though not popular science writing at its worst (Morris at least comes across as a neutral reporter, and his facts are generally correct), the Evolutionists is popular science writing at its most mediocre. What a disappointment. Are Morris' other books this lame?"
2,Wavy after 10 months,"We hung this screen in front of a wall of bookshelves in our living room, so we can pull it down when we want to watch a dvd or play Xbox with our projector. I love not having a TV be the focus of the living room.The screen was great at first, though the pull-down mechanism is a little finicky. However, after a few months, I noticed the screen had developed some slight vertical ripples, but they weren't affecting the picture. Now the screen has gotten so wavy, the picture is distorted. We're going to have to replace it with a higher quality screen."
5,"Great Product, Unbelievable Price","Just what I needed for my Powerpoint presentations. I now have mounting brackets in my various classrooms. Since I can't risk leaving the screen in a classroom to be damaged or vandalized, I just slip it off the mounting brackets and keep it in my conference room between classes. It's light,portable but well designed, and it's MADE IN THE USA, NOT CHINA!"
5,A book that fills your soul with hope,This is a great book that gives you a better understanding of who you are and where your worth comes from. It helps you bring what you learn from your bible studies and quiet time and bring it into your life.
5,Funny - touching - real,Lysa has the uncanny ability to connect the dots of real-life and Biblical truth to draw out life-changing lessons that a real girl can actually live by. She is hilarious and can make you cry all at the same time! Get this book!
4,Becoming More Than A Good Bible Study Girl,Quality was excellent. Clear and easily understood. We have only viewed the first lesson but it does seem a little youthful. Would recommend for non Sr. ladies.
4,Still a good mystery but...,"I thought this book had too many loose ends. What's going on with Uncle Leo? How did the person trashing Morgan's room get in? What's with the stalker in Chicago? And others I won't mention so I don't give anything away. I thought the ""wrap-up"" regarding why the victims were killed seemed a little quick and didn't really offer a plausible enough reason. All that being said, however, it's a quick, clever and well-written mystery. I loved ""Audition for Murder"" and hope there will be more Morgan Taylor mysteries. Maybe even one that answers questions about Uncle Leo and the stalker!"
3,Barely entertaining,"Can't give a half star or this would have been a 2.5. It's not surprising there are only 2 books in this ""series""; the first one wasn't very good, and this one is worse. There's not enough plot, and too much character development. I know that probably sounds odd, since character development is usually a good thing. However, when it's a murder mystery, I want more plot, not Morgan's grandmother's silly sayings. Morgan isn't a very nice person; she hates illness and has no use for those who are ill. She's pretty unbelieveable: a clever-carrying psycho chasing her and she cracks wise; ditto when a thug has a gun pointed at her. Really? She's shallow and has an inflated ego; theater people are so superior, don't you know? I guess I just don't care that much about the attitudes of theater people, and this story (and the first book) is dripping with it."
3,Get Ripped to the Core,"The exercises are very good. Long sets and very challenging. My only problem is that I bought this ""Get Ripped to the Core"" and the other one ""Slim and Lean"". They are both the exact same video, nothing different. It is very misleading and truthfully, a rip off. You think you are buying two different videos and they are the same, exact different packaging and different name."
4,Effective full body workout,Very effective and tough full body workout. No body part is left untouched. I am a big fan of Jari and have most of the workouts. Although I like this workout my favorite is Ripped 1000!
4,A well done book on the American Revolution in the South,"The Road To Guilford Courthouse is a very good summary of the late war southern campaign in American Revolution. The book reads like a Ken Burn's PBS series with lots of original quotes from the period. The author is also very outspoken about the personalities of the participants and this will probably open him to some criticism. The campaign is well laid out, although the maps were poor, and it is easy to follow the plans of major figures. The bibliography is good and allows anyone doubting Mr. Buchanan's interpetations to check his facts. The books only real weak spot for me is that it just ends after the battle of Guilford Courthouse. I would have enjoyed reading more about the later campaign in Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia. Overall a well done book that reads easily yet is full of solid information"
3,hard to read,its very hard to read it really makes you think and gives me stress so i couldnt read the whole book
4,Daddy is cool indeed!,"Of the covers, the three best are ""You Never Can Tell,"" ""Daddy Cool,"" and ""Baby Let Me Bang Your Box."" The original stuff is very reminiscent of the Stones live sound and I like it all. Even if there weren't several other very good tunes (but there are), ""Eagle Rock"" alone is truly worth the price. It was great fun to rediscover this band thirty years after my introduction from an exchange student."
5,boot camp fun,"i love tracey's boot camps. this one has segments broken up so i can do one or two if i am tired or don't have much time, or all of it if i get excited and have lots of energy. i like the way she puts drills together, so it is not boring and uses all of your body. it has been great for my hips and thighs and i always raise my heart rate!thanks tracey!"
5,Bedtime,"A sweet, bedtime book for shared reading with K-1 students and their parents. I think I would have preferred humans, not animals in clothing as the subject of the illustrations. It contains excellent color illustrations, and I would recommend this to the 2nd and 3rd grade students, as well as the teachers and parents"
4,Mini Disc has reached a pinnacle,"Once I solved the software issues, this unit has been nothing but impressive. I gave it 4 stars as I frequently hook the unit up to a home audio system and the unit itself doesn't display track information (the remote does). It deserves 5 stars for every other reason. I couldn't get the software from the supplied software CD to work properly. After downloading the latest version of Sonic Stage from Sony, it has worked flawlessly. The software is simple to use and intuitive - I have yet to read the instructions. It does everything as advertised and sounds great. I love being able to swap out discs instead of being tied to whatever my iPod holds at the time. I also like that I can use any recording from any source to listen to."
3,Great.... while it worked,"I'm a cellist. This product worked for about 2months, then only worked half the time. Slowly, the percentages of working recordings decreased, and it started to make my md's unreadable.While it worked, the sound quality was excellent; truly cd quality if you have a good mic.I guess I got unlucky... but what I would like to mention is how I was dealt with over at customer service. I sent it in once, when it was returned they had not fixed the problem. And, when I tried sending it in again... they said it would cost almost 100 dollars to repair because it had gone out of warranty... I'm just mad they didnt fix it the FIRST time I sent it in. I did not risk spending 100 to have the same mistake happen again, so as it is,,, I'm down a music recorder and looking for another one."
5,Inspired version of larks tongue!!!,"Strongest recording in years! Beautiful interludes of voice-synth interspersed with great Belew tunes, Robert & Treys mad guitars. Makes a nice contrast 30 years after the first Larks Tongue. The version of Larks Tongue at the end is among the best."
2,Poorer quality than the old Corning Pyrex version,"I just receved my new set having broken my old 2.5 quart last week. I would suggest as someone else did that you try to pick up the old Corning version from a garage/yard sale if you see them. These new versions are much thinner than the old old ones and as a result have a ""delicate"" feel to them.They also have a slightly blue tint to them unlike the orginal clear versions which make me a bit pensive about their durability due to the issues other have had with the blue sets.Corning appears to have licenced their production out to World Kitchen, LLC now."
3,last reviewer's right,"I've owned 3 pairs of these when i was a kid.The soles are marking. If you stomp on something or drag your feet, you will leave dark thick black marks.The toe likes to come unglued from the sole. I reccomend shoe goo.The leather, if it can be called such, is coated with plastic of some sort. It's not spit shineable.The boots are decently light and somewhat wearable. They get 3 stars because they're cheap."
5,Great,"I thought the first book of the Fingerprints series was great! I love the whole fingerprint reader thing. And Anthony seems awesome! Whoever reads this book, you won't be able to put it down! I bought the next 3 books I liked the first one so much!"
3,"Enjoyable Game, A couple of Software Glitchy things","Loved the game, was annoyed by some of the glitches. The storyline is interesting and the puzzles were fun to solve. The software design could have better thought out as if you solved a puzzle ahead of where the game thought you should have, it seemed to get stuck. I actually had to load earlier saved games and redo a couple of sections. That sort of thing takes away from the fun."
4,"Dark Cloud 2 has a lot of depth and any help you can get, even imcomplete, is appreciated.","There are very few RPGs that have as much depth as Dark Cloud 2, it is one of those rare PS2 games that realizes the true potential of the PS2. I can't imagine how big a complete guide would have to be for DC2. Even if this guide had only helped me a little I would have been happy, but it helped me a lot. I'm one of those players that don't like to use guides but when I do I want it to hold my hand and walk me through it and this is the only thing that keeps this guide from being 5 stars."
2,Poor Vendor,"This appears to be a good lamp - well designed and well made, but I can't give it more than two stars because of the vendor: the S&H charge ($13.84) was outrageous and the `handling' was beyond sloppy - it seems to have been packed by a six-year-old with misanthropic tendencies, I'm surprised it survived the journey."
4,"Wonderful Lamp, I Wish that Instruction Could Put an Avg Temperature","Wonderful Lamp, nice and movable, really sturdy, my complain is to keep it completely out of moisture because I feel like there is a tendency to corrode with time. Not only that, but also when you put a light bulb (energy saving type Nvision 14 watts = 60 watts) it gets a little bit hot if you're not in a well ventilated area, I can't imagine if it was a halogen light bulb.Overral, Great lamp, just make sure you're in a well ventilated area before turning it on."
3,It's okay,"I really felt compelled to read this book because of the description. I like time travel and I want to see some hilarious interplay caused by the past/future differences between the characters. Sadly, there were some parts of misunderstanding but the time travel wasn't an integral part of the story. I wished the author would get into deep POV so that I can understand why the heroine reacts a certain way instead of just telling me that she's crying. It's an okay read not bad but I wished I was left more satisfied."
4,"Very Useful, Good Quality","This video, available in both VHS (listed by the director, Bill Myers) and DVD (listed by the instructor, Michael Bradley) formats, offers a very useful and clear introduction to essential (foil) fencing techniques. Some of the information is wrong (points are no longer scored against the receiver, but for the toucher), and others I disagree with (his en guarde stance is more epee than foil), but most of the instruction is very good, and the quality is also good. Overall, this is the best instructional video I've seen for fencing, and I wish there were more like it."
3,Shows the basics well,"This video is very practical for the beginner, it covers the most basic elements of the sport, and provides specific instruction and details on basic fencing techniques and terminology.However, the filming style and narrative techniques leave little to be desired.Shot with a single camera in a gymnasium, we follow the lessons from our instructor who is clearly qualified to teach, but is not an engaging host.There are some sound and lighting glitches that give the film a very homemade quality.This is a practical video for those who want to see specific drills and tips for actual fencing.Definitely for the beginner...but this is what it aims at."
4,Deathstalkers Fantasy-Horror Game,"Very good game! Lots of content and a really good system. This is an excellent game for those looking for a non d-20 system game. World guide is a little sparse, and you have to read through the gods and races to get a good understanding of the world's depth. But other than that complaint I think this is an excellent game. Regardless of what some say, I think the combat system is easy to understand (just read the tutorials and it's no problem at all)."
2,"For a sequel in the series, this one sucks!!!","If you are looking for a Friday the 13th followup with the same lines as the original this movie is a cheap knockoff... There are a few good scenes that add elements from the first 4 four films, but if you want the original lines you are better sticking with the original film from 1980. This movie is very gory and has some graphic sex and nudity so it's not for the kiddies! What's up with Jason being muscular and kidnapping the chick from the campsite at the beginning of the film? Isn't Jason supposed to kill everybody he comes into contact with?"
3,GOOD,GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BECAUSE OF MARCUS NISPEL DIRECTING THIS I THOUGHT HE DID A GREAT JOB DIRECTING THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2003 THAT FILM WAS GREAT IT WAS WELL FILMED VERY CREEPY AND VERY EERIE BUT THIS WASNT LIKE THAT AT ALL JARED PADELECKI WAS GOOD BUT THE REST WHERE BAD ACTORS SO I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD BUT NOTHING SPECIAL I HEARD THERE DOING A PART 2 ILL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT
1,"They Could Have Kept This, Seriously","Being the Friday The 13th fan that I am, I can only be biased to this remake. It seems in all the haste of the screenwriters to put the first four original Friday movies together, they only made more of a mess of the series begun with Jason Goes to Hell and the God Awful Jason X.I really would have like to see them expand on the Pamela Voorhees angle than just drop Jason in our laps the way that they did. It really would have been in great Friday tradition.I did like the kill sequences, they were quite crafty and kept my attention, but other than that, this movie totally falls flat.I truly hope there is no sequel in the works. I liked the Platinum Dunes production companies Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Beginning offering over this. Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself."
2,"Not awful, but not very good.","It's a well made film, good gore, kills and all that. but I don't know, there seems to be something missing. Kind of a empty copy of the old films... like they watched the old ones and just copied it without the 'feeling' of the old ones. Not that the originals were deep films or anything, but they still had something that this one is missing. Nice to see Jason again though, and the guy playing him does a good job."
5,Long live Jason Voorhees!,"I have been a lifelong Friday the 13th fan and when I heard that they were remaking it, I wasn't scared at all, it is a formula that is kind of hard to screw up. This attempt is not perfect and suffers some of the problems that most modern horror movies do (too much CG & too many ""stars"") but overall I think that it did a good job. Some people complained about some of the weapons Jason used... I think that that is stupid and if you pay attention it actually makes perfect sense. I haven't watched it in a while, but writing about it now makes me want to, it delivers on what it is supposed to - mindless sex and violence wrapped around a core of a morality play, those who misbehave get punished. This was a good movie and a good DVD worthy of the Voorhees family."
2,"Good watching it the first time,but it is forgetable",i rented this movie and loved it. the when i bought it it was dumber than i thought. i easily forgot and am regretting buying this movie
1,HORRIBLE LEAVE THE OLDER STUFF ALONE,"I Totally hated this movie!!!! It had nothing to do with Jason, just sex and a running idiot who sets traps and kidnaps??? This IS NOT JASON!! That is as bad as what Rob Zombie did to the Halloween films. Nothing but sex and foul mouths.......I am a die hard horror fan, I could watch the original Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Slumber Party Massacre, Howling... ect all day long. But this worthless crap isn't even worth my time. All I have to say is watch out cause I am sure they will start remaking Slumber party massacre! Now dont get me wrong those showed their fair share of boobs and sex, but it didn't normally last long....a remake of that will no doubt be hard core porn and the whole point of the movie is gone!! I wish I could make movies, I would do John Carpenter justice for a change, i bet he went to the bathroom after watching Rob Zombies remake of Halloween!"
2,Really?,"After seeing Halloween be remade successfully, I had high hopes for this. I didn't go to the theater to see this because I'm not a big Jason fan, but I like the series enough to buy the dvd when it came out. I watched it and I was extremely disappointed. There are few, if any, good actors in the whole movie. The best part is the first 20 minutes or so when Jason is wearing the sack over his head, which that part is only good because of Jason's look. Worst thing is, there are talks for a sequel. I'm going to say a quote from Dr. Loomis with a little twist. ""No matter how many movies they continue to make, Jason Vorhees is dead. Now do you brain dead gossip mungers want me to spell that out for you? D-E-A-D!"""
2,Jason remake is horrible,"First of all, we all know that whats a scary movie without nudity from chicks? of cmon, thats NOT why girls see the movie so why do we have to deal with it? (DVD 9 more minutes of sex scenes??? CMON!) a stupid girl water skiing topless...really? thats so stupid. And the fact Jason shoots her boyfriend with a bow and arrow?! He doesnt do that!! The only pro to this is the main actor. and its sad cause hes also in another crappy movie called House of Wax. tisk tisk. What a shame."
2,Aggressively Stupid!,"I love JASON movies, so I hope they keep making these things, but this is a pretty poor attempt. The dialogue is absolutely terrible, script is poor, direction is lame, acting serviceable to irritating, kills are dull, cinematography sucks, etc...but I love watching Jason running around and slashing people, so it is enjoyable despite itself. These things are like James Bond movies, listen to the fans and throw in a new wrinkle or two and everyone leaves the theater happy. I really enjoyed FREDDY VS. JASON, so why is this one so stupid? Also, please banish implants from all future horror films! Enough is enough. The romp in the bedroom is a lot of fun, but the girl in the campfire scene shoulda kept her top on. Let's hope the next JASON sports a real director and a decent script!"
4,refreshing remake,"the movie friday the 13th is slighlt a form of cheese, but we love it anyway! this remake had a bit of a changa where the hero {jared padeliki} is searching for his sister. there's the given slasher moments, and traditional t n a. i loved it anyway! great acting! i just watched it again last night."
1,Yawn,"I have several terrific Evan-Moor books in my collection. However, I was dissatisfied with this book. There were no innovative ideas presented for the topic. I could have as easily, and more cheaply, done a Google search and gotten the same results."
1,Disappointed,"This item is advertised as a double feature, well when you open the case it only has one movie.Check with the seller prior to the purchaseLesson learned"
4,Good ear buds with a catch,"In short: these ear buds are very good.They have excellent sound quality and a wonderful carrying case (which also happens to be large enough for my mp3 player to fit in as well- doubly useful).The catch is the ""twist to fit"" design. The company includes several sizing pieces for the ear buds and it can take quite a bit of guesswork to figure out which are comfortable for you- once you find it, you can wear them for long periods of time without much fatigue. If you don't choose the right pieces for you, the ear buds are abysmally uncomfortable.Four out of five stars for a very good set of ear buds with a catch which will leave many people unhappy."
3,sound is good but a little uncomfortable,I expected these headphones to be better than they are for the price. They have pretty good sound and bass response but its not much of an improvement over $20 ear buds. They are a bit uncomfortable at first but after a while they are ok.I guess if they last longer than the cheaper headphones then they were worth it but I would not recommend them.PS. You have to where the right cord behind your neck to keep the wire from coiling up and to reduce the pressure on your left ear.
5,CLASSICS OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR,"I use this book as a primary source for a graduate level Organization Development Course. It presents a comprehensive foundation of the field using original articles by the ""founders"" of OD. It is the only OD book I have found that gets all of this between its covers! Highly recommend. Dr. Lloyd Greene, Texas State University."
4,If you like Mel Brooks humor...,"This is a fun book. If you like Blazzin' Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie etc type of humor, you'll like this. Its not one-liners, but tongue in cheek stuff. Won't make you split your sides laughing (I didn't necessarily laugh at all), but its a good humorous light read and worth the time. Character development is quick and uncomplicated. Easily passes the time if you have that long flight from say NY to LA with layovers, are on the beach laying out, or just bored on a rainy day. I picked up his Ogre book as well and so far seems to be of the same style. After long days of studying, work, or other such pain, makes for a good escape."
4,One of Boy George's best solo singles!!,When Will You Learn is one of Boy George's best solo singles. There are several different versions available on this CD. This catchy tune will stick in your head for the rest of the day. Hopefully Culture Club's new album will follow this formula. **** 4 1/2 stars
4,Mystery and Romance,A light romantic mystery in the classic sense. The heroine is a woman of independence before this was proper. Her escapades are always interesting and the endings satisfying.
3,still cannot help you,"This item was purchased as a gift and I do know if it works, if they like it or anything else."
3,"A great idea, but problems.",I've had two of these.When they're working they're great. Unfortunately the plastic mounting rings break occasionally and sometimes the filter gasket leaks.
5,"Useful, excellent, and detailed","This is a truly useful and excellently detailed book. Not only to look at, although the book is illustrated quite well, of course. And the author has evidently been forthcoming with his secrets and ""inside knowledge"" of Illustrator. This is potent and useful stuff.The book is extremely well organized, with each chapter building on the previous one. The chapters are labeled with fun, yet not condescending or childish, labels that make it a simple matter to know what you'll find within the pages. There are many excellent step-by-step examples; they walk you step-by-step through recreating each effect and function.t"
2,Pretty while it works,"I gave this as a gift to my fiance exactly 6 months ago. Moved the clock to the mantle, and it wouldn't chime. The instructions are simple, I don't even need them to figure out the mere three buttons on the clock and the switch options are ""On, Off, Auto [chime alarm], Alarm [beeping alarm]"" I set up a chime alarm, it didn't go off. I turned the switch to ""On"" and the chimes still don't go off. The clock is still working, the chimes are not. What a shame. I give it two stars because at least the clock still works and the beeping alarm.I ordered this from Avon 1/31/2007, so I cannot comment on the this company's customer service."
1,Numbers individual show on demand,"I bought one show this way, and would not buy any others. I had missed seeing some of the shows during the season and wanted to see how this would go, but the quality was so poor that I did not even watch the entire program. I have not tried anything else ""on demand"" because of this experience. I will wait for the entire season on DVD. This was a disappointment!"
1,(x+y)^2+z/w... uauuu,"(x+y)^2+z/wz=squareroot(w)-3n-(2)^2*(b-1)This summarizes the way they make plots for this TV show. If you like to watch things that make sense don't waste your money on this show.The acting is also pretty bad, looks very artificial."
4,Has practical value,I tried to repeat this Jesus prayer before sleep. It quiets my mind and I can feel into sleep easily.
4,Great to have T.o.P. on DVD,"This concert is taken directly from a TV-broadcast from 1998 (hence the slightly cheesy titles in between songs). ""Ohne Filter"" was a German TV-show dedicated to showing live performances of blues, jazz, R&B and soul artists, and since none of this is mainstream, the series was produced on a limited budget. Consequently, the visual and sonic quality of this DVD is not immaculate, although I think it is not nearly as bad as some people make it sound. The bonus material is redundant, but that is not what I bought the DVD for.Do not buy this DVD if you are looking for a visually impressive concert dvd, making full use of this medium - you will be disappointed! However, in my opinion it is the music that counts, and Tower of Power deliver what you expect from them, which already makes this DVD wortwhile to me."
2,Where Is The Power?,"I was so excited to see Tower was finally going to release a dvd. However , maybe they shouldn't have. The audio is terrible , it is all horns & lead vocals. Drums,keys,guitar,bass & backing vocals are buried in the mix. Save your money. Tower is much stronger than this. If you want to see a great Tower video , check out Francis Rocco Prestia's ""Fingerstyle Funk"" instructional video. It has some clips of T.O.P. in concert playing most of the classics & the audio is very good. They also have some great closeup shots of Rocco layin' it down. Like other reveiwers have said,go see them live & you won't be dissapointed."
3,Could've Been Better,"This version of the band has Brent Carter on vocals, and I never liked him as much as Tom Bowes before and Larry LB Braggs after. The sound on this disc sounds like it was taken from T.V. You can't even hear Rocco that well. The show is from 1998 and was not T.O.Ps first performance on Ohne Filter. They also played there in 1991 with Tom Bowes singing and the sound quality is much better, plus I think it is a better show. It's too bad that that show has still not been released officially, although it does pop up on Ebay from time to time un-officially. T.O.P. really needs to get a concert video of the current band released and show people just how hot they are right now. This DVD is a must for T.O.P. fans, but I would pass if you're not hardcore about the band."
5,"saturn, neptune, uranus, and plutos transformation songs",If anyone wants to buy some sailormoon songs. i have too many. i have over 100 songs about sailor moon. i am willing to trade. i just want to get rid of some of them. i hope you all would help me get rid of them.
4,For the budding artist,"My six year old has always been drawn to a wax-scratch drawing her artist aunt did, so I thought she might like this. She did. She went to town scratching pictures and covering the fridge with them. Although the value was fine, I do wish there would have been more coated papers. Now I am off to find some kind of refill for her."
4,Fun but overpriced.,"These are a lot of fun to do for all ages. The sheets are only half size and that was a bit disappointing, it'd be nice if they would include some full sized sheets too. The stencils are a nice touch, although we only used a few of them. Overall this is a nice project to have on hand for the younger crowd. It helps to fill the boredom on car trips or rainy days."
3,Ok for heavy doors,"This product is good for heavy doors, but has to much resistance for doors located inside the house; such as, kitchen doors or bedroom doors. Older people will find them difficult to use."
1,Difficult to Install,"In fact, I never figured out how the heck to install this door closer at all!The item may be good (who knows, my friend and I only ended up pretty much breaking it into bits), but the instructions are foul. It was imperative that I have a door closer installed, so I finally ended up having my locksmith install one.Very disappointing."
1,Save your money - Buy a BIC!,"I've owned several of this model lighter. Like most Colibri lighters, it looks great and feels good in your hand. The problem is reliability. After a short while, the igniter mechanism ceases to function properly."
3,Another one bites the dust,Man. Here is another bomb from a smooth jazz saxophonist. Sounds more like a rehearsal than a performance. I expected more from Euge.
2,Chillaxin is the cut,There is only maybe 3 or 4 cuts on this cd.Chillaxin is the cut everything paul brown help or produce is bangin. I tell any one buy this and get ready to ballroom and day dream to agood cd
4,Good book on benchwork,"I have to assume this, I was a complete newbie to lumberwork before reading this book, and while I'm still very far to be a master in this particular art in model railroading, I can say this book helped me a lot on the subject. There may be some flaws on advanced subjects as noted on other reviews, such as modular layouts or foam based strategies (which I recently used on a N scale time-saver), but the goal attained on techniques to use on lumber and traditional layouts makes this book a worthy purchase for begginer and intermediate modellers, as it both introduces basic techniques and develops them on more advanced subjects throught the book."
4,powerful progressive rock,"Listening to this CD by the excellent South African 60s group Freedom's Children I feel like I'm in a weird alternate universe where this group is as well-known as Yes, Deep Purple, and Pink Floyd -- it's that good. They had the talent, but not the breaks. I rate it as highly as albums by the above groups in the mid- to late 60s. It merits more attention, even at this late date."
4,Good quality and a lot of info,"I bought this book awhile back. I have used some of the ideas in it while working on a banjatar that I am building. I haven't used the parts about playing the banjo yet as I'm not finished with my banjatar or don't yet have a banjo. The book is well written and has a lot of information in it. If your interested in learning the banjo, I would recommend it to you."
2,old style isnt better,"this is an origional book and the tab isnt the same as in the new books, notes sit above the line instead of thru it."
2,Not the best organization,"This book is good at giving information about the banjo and helping one develop techniques. I would have liked to have had more songs interspersed within the exercises so I felt like I was progressing. As of right now, I am still trying to get through the techniques sections and have not been able to play a song yet. If I do cheat and move forward to where all the songs are located, they are too advanced for me to apply the techniques I have already learned. With better organization, this can be a fantastic book."
3,"Maybe, maybe not.","'Collection of essays loosely touted as art criticism. He's a ranter who managed to find a niche teaching English atUniv of Nevada in Las Vegas. His vocabulary had me hauling out the dictionary (a plus) and although a bit obtuse,overall it's fairly entertaining. He was on a panel at the Hardwood Museum of Art in Taos on August 1, 2009. There's an excerpt on youtube at: [...]"
1,Look for another book to read this is junk,Hickeys over and misuse of words plagues the entire book. Trust me this book will make you sick. He is constantly going off in all directions with out reason or purpose. One sentence could describe every chapter of his book. Its also troublesome to have to read something with a dictionary in one had just to understand what the guy is saying. He seemingly goes out of his way to add the most annoying words you won't find anywhere else in his book. It's an obvious attempt by hickey to create an illusion of heightened intelligence. If your time is of value skip this book.
2,Nothing special,"Purchased this because of the claims that people saw a difference in 1 day. I am NOT one of those people sadly. I have dry skin and experience hormonal break-outs from time to time. I didn't notice a difference at all after using this product. Maybe it's for younger, or even oily skin."
3,eh,"It worked really well at first, making pimples disappear in 2-3 days. Now, it either works in 5-7 days, or does nothing. Note: It makes applied area shiny"
3,Okay,"I find that this stuff doesn't work that well. if I use it every few days, it's fine, but I suggest finding a different brand"
2,does not work,"It does help at the first week or the second. but, later on, it does not help at all. I don't know why."
2,Meh..,"I'm gonna have to disagree with the claim that it doesnt over dry skin .. it definitely does. I put this on as directed for two nights, nothing happened. it wasn't until the fourth day that I noticed all the peeling happening around my pimples where i put the product. was soooo drying, made the parts of my skin dry and flaky and gross. i peeled off the skin, because it was just too disgusting not to. It did clear up my skin a bit, but it wasn't worth all the nasty peeling. Would not recommend, would not buy again."
4,Good beauty buy!,"I have been using this product for a couple years now and it really works nice. It is a fairly inexpensive alternative to those big, name-brand acne products. Plus, I always have clean & clear coupons! One thing to know is this is a spot treat ointment. So, apply it to only one pimple or it will not work. It is not meant to be spread over acne areas."
3,Gets weak at the end,"I have been a TA for 5 semesters for Cultural Anthropology, and this was the first semester we have used this book (Fall 2002).This is a very thorough basic introduction to Cultural Anthropology, basically taking an interpretive approach. However, I find the sections on gender, kinship, colonialism, and applied anthropology weak. The chapters on gender and kinship are wanting - the gender chapter is really only about hierarchy and could use an addition of theory. The kinship chapter is simultaneously superficial and too advanced. The terms at the end of the chapter are really advanced, coming right after a chapter that was really general. I was also not very satisfied with the discussion of race or the definition of hegemony. Generally, this is a great effort, but could use some more revision and careful thought in some of the chapters."
5,AMAZING,This album is absolutaley amazing. There is not one week track on the entire thing. I dont think its to far away where Lucky 7 will be all over the place. They have been working hard for years and its about time they get their due. once again this is an AMAZING ALBUM!
3,Patriotic Globe Miniature Party Lights,"We bought the lights to use at our camper in DE and they work well. One issue I had with them is the setting up...they are not easily setup with someone with extra large hands. The space at the top of the globes was a really tight fit for my fingers, so my wife did most of them (mostly to keep me from ripping them).Overall, they work well and accomplish what we set out to do...the only other issue I have is, it seemed a bit 'pricey' for just 10 lights (per box) and crepe paper coverings."
4,Almost Perfect,"This is the third Olympus camera I have owned, with the last one being a C50. Overall, I am very pleased with the camera.PROS:1. Great metal body. Very sturdy and fashionable2. Takes great pictures for a point and shoot. Bright pictures and the color is very good3. Nice size. Can fit in a pocket, but you will notice it, but easy to carry around at parties and family functions.4. Simple point and click if you want, or you can customize almost all aspects of a shot. It's the best of both worlds.5. Great camera for the price. A ton of value at 300 bucks.CONS:1. Load time when turning camera on with a large memory card is very slow. Plan on waiting 5 seconds for the camera to enter ""ready mode"" with a large memory card.2. Could do better at taking wide angle shots. Canon is better in this area.Overall, I recommend this camera for those looking for a great point and click camera."
4,Easier to work menus than you may think,"I bought this camera last month and my husband loves it. He loves the 2:1 feature, the 15 second movie bit, and the ease to look at pictures already taken without having to close the camera. I bought an extra battery and larger XD card. These items go a long way to a better experience. All Olympus cameras have very similar menus to work with so it is easier to navigate through the menus if you are familiar with Olympus cameras. This is an easy camera to operate."
5,Great compact camera,I bought this camera a year and a half ago because I was looking for a decent camera for a trip. This camera has been great. One of the deciding factors for me was that it has a metal body as opposed to plastic. I absolutely love it. It is nice and compact and produces great quality images. I also have been really pleased with how rugged yet functional it is. A must buy piece of equipment for any beginning digital photographer.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I received this camera as a birthday present. I have an Olympus C-3000 and since I have had such luck with this Olympus, wanted to upgrade to something smaller and better. Well, the C60 looks and feels great but I was terribly disappointed in the quality of the pictures, as well as not being user friendly. Battery life is also TERRIBLE."
1,"If I could give a zero, I would.","The content is out dated. The data is presented in a long series of lists, which usually reads like a dictionary. I tried even using the references, but of the three I tried one was correct, one was broken, and one was a dating site.I initially bought the kindle version, however it only works on the PC. I returned that (Thanks Amazon) and bought the paper copy.Luckily I get to sell the book back to amazon.If anyone has to use this book, please use the student resources on the publisher's website. It has great multiple choice tests that will give you the answers."
1,Horrible out of date Software Engineering book,"This book is like a bloated piece of software. The author wastes so much of the book describing outdated methods and does not even seem to understand current methods. For example, many of the chapters describe procedural programming techniques such as data flow diagrams and then give a brief inaccurate description of modern techniques such as UML. The author also makes a big deal about comparing ""traditional"" programming and object oriented. Given that object oriented has been the dominant style for about 20 years, it just seems irrelevant to discuss it so much in the book. The examples in the book are also very confusing and hard to relate to. Instead of picking something simple that everybody knows like a banking system, he often uses something like a convoluted sensor system. This is just a horrible book and it's unfortunate that many CS students have to get stuck using it."
1,This book is actively harmful to Software Engineering,"I have never seen or heard anyone quote from this book or even list it as a reference in my entire career -- it is simply not valued. In spite of the fact that it is frequently used as a reference book in CS degrees, it does not reflect any practitioner's approach, and is appallingly misleading in both its approach and its grasp of the subject matter. Most software engineers would laugh themselves silly if you tried to use this book in practice.In particular, don't try and design using this book. If you're interested in design, I'd recommendDomain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of SoftwareorPatterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and I also likeDesign Driven Testing: Test Smarter, Not Harderas one of the more practical books out there."
3,"Works, but has cons.","I have used two applicators worth of this product and it works as far as moisturizing goes. There is no leakage after applying it which is nice. However, I've noticed once inside it turns in to sort of a cottage cheese textured lotion. This isn't a problem normally, however it becomes a disgusting mess if you have sex. So, if you're using it just for discomfort it's probably worth it, but for me the mess created during sex was enough to deter me from using it again."
1,Pro-Castro propaganda.,"First, there is no ""blockade"" of Cuba; there hasn't been for almost thirty-five years. Then, it was called a ""quarantine,"" because the term ""blockade"" means an act of war. Castro and his sycophants want people to believe that the U.S. refusal to trade with his repellent little dictatorship is an act of war. In fact it is an act of moral protest, comparable to the drive to ""disvest"" in South Africa when it was under apartheid. The whole point of the book is a lie, backed by dubious statistics and attempts to wrack the readers' emotions, all delivered in a shrill, self-righteous whine.In sum, it's a total waste of time, unless you happen to be studying leftist ""solidarity"" groups and their tactics. As such, this book ranks as classic - even exemplary - pro-Castro propaganda"
5,"good deal, great deal, no,excelent,deal!",Great deal for the price you can not do any better the productt is great and for the price ohteres would charge just to ship
4,Very Good Book for some with no C++ Background,"This is a very good book if you are are new to C++ or Object Oriented Programming. The first few chapters may seem intimidating to the first-time reader or to someone who has had no prior programming experience. Don't loose hope, it all falls in place as you move along. I would have given it 5 stars if not for a couple of typos. It is not a reference book if you are looking for one. It is more for people who like I said are new to programming.Tini Korah Programmer/Analyst GS Technologies"
5,Imagination Alive and Well,"I still remember how much I enjoyed watching this series in the early 70's. Revisiting the episodes in this collection turns out to be just as much fun. I'm really impressed with the restoration as the picture quality is the best I've seen for that period. The disc's sound track holds up very well. The costumes, the models (both animate and inanimate) and the music! In its day the shows were groundbreaking in that they offered a lot of very moody themes some of which seemed to defy logic. The episodes also presented some very creative and interesting video techniques many of which we wouldn't see for years to come on domestic network TV. All in all a set well worth buying."
3,Blast from the Past,"Enjoyed seeing some of the old sci-fi stuff, some of it is kinda corny and gets a bit slow in spots. The guy that plays the main character Straker needs to get more than one expression on his face, he has basically a ""none expression"" expression. Botox face, but they didn't have it back then, hah! It has some commic value anyway now, though it wasn't supposed to back then. Still rather fun to watch."
4,"A great introduction to the ""old stuff""...","I first discovered Sixpence at a music festival in KY where I promptly picked up thier then ""new"" album, ""This Beautiful Mess."" I have been hooked ever since. ""Collage"" is a great introduction to all the rich, textured Sixpence music already out there -- the smooth melodies, the poetic lyrics of Matt Slocum, and of course Leigh Nash's sweet-as-ice-cream voice. My only complaint would be the absence of a few favorites such as ""Disconnect,"" ""Trust,"" and ""Maybe Tommorow."""
2,disappointing,"I usually like the swash-buckling, sword-fighting action movies of the past, and Stewart Granger was great in Scaramouche, so I had high expectations for this flim. However, the supporting cast was weak, story-line thin, and even Stewart Granger seemed to have a difficult time with his role in making us believe he was truly invested in his part."
4,Were Happy,Were happy with it you learn a hole new vocabulary. it is a good book so far I haven't finished it yet.
5,Great book on two of American's founding fathers,A great book on Aaron Burr if you want/need to know more about this Vice President. Tells a sad story about the end of a great American - Alexander Hamilton. Good book to understand what the country was going through at this time of Jefferson.
4,Power Rangers Pinata,"The pinata was a bit pricey, but Power Ranger items are difficult to find. Also, the two extras were nice. It held a nice amount of candy and took a good beating at the party. I was not happy with the packing. It was crammed into a pizza box, and some of the fringe was destroyed when we unpacked it. I recommend that the sellers consider how they pack their items in the future."
4,This cooks beautifully!,"I would call our family ""Toaster Oven Power Users"" for sure. We go through a toaster oven every two years. This is my favorite yet. The convection bake and broil cooks very evenly. We cook everything in it that will fit- pies, cookies, muffins, cornbread, etc. It also toasts four or six pieces of bread perfectly (depending on the slice size). My only hang up is the CRAZY LOUD beeping. I don't like risking waking up the baby while cooking, and you have to hit the buttons a million times to get it from the default cook time (30 minutes) to the actual cook time and it beeps with every single touch. It also beeps non-stop when the cooking time has elapsed, so you have to physically stop what you are doing and run to the oven when it's done. But, it doesn't make any noise while it's cooking, unlike other dial toaster ovens that go tick-tick-tick."
5,toaster oven,ASIN:B000ATW400 VillaWare V41005 Moderno Series Stainless Steel Digital Convection Toaster Oven]]Love this oven it works great and I cane back it it.
5,Great Story!!,"What a great story of courage & friendship! As far as Chebacca's comments, this is coming from someone who rates Grand Theft Auto as a 5 star game with a comment of ""Hours of Entertainment"" Period."
1,Total rip-off,They don't tell you on the product description that it's 423 pages but in 3 inch by 4 inch!!! It's pocket sized but with large print. I wanted to use this in my study of Bhagwad Gita but most of the real words are not covered in the dictionary at all!
3,Reasonably Good Toner Cartridge,Purchased over a dozen of these cartridges over 3 months for one of our digital printers. Most of the cartridges worked fine but had 2 that failed in very short order and had to throw out.Make sure that whoever you buy these from will replace defective units.
1,I hate this camera!!!!,"When I was looking for cameras, all I wanted was a easy point-and-shoot. Nothing fancy. I bought this one because of the price. I wish I could return it!Problems:horrible battery life- lasts about an hour at the mostwhen i went to hawaii, i had to put new batteries in every place i went.really long shutter lag- even taking still portraits of people is a dragbulky- weighs you down, not a pocket camera"
5,Found practical and inspirational ideas,"I'm always looking for new ways to present my product or to serve my clients and I found this book had some great ""angles"" for me."
2,One experience I didn't need,"Presumably Mr. Mallory rows much better than he writes. His writing style has been branded unique by another reviewer. They are too kind. As I read this book, I kept losing my place not sure if I had already read the drivel in front of me. It was that bad."
3,Make Sure your Using WINDOWS OS or this book is pretty useless.,"I just received my copy and was astonished that the whole book and CD is for people running the Windows OS. Not of much use to any other platform I'm afraid. If I ordered a book on "".net"" I would have assumed this but, not from a book about Python. Oh well it's Windows world and it might be fine for someone on that OS."
3,It's OK for the money and assembly tips,"The instructions are nonexistent but with a bit of patience, common sense and engineering thought they are not that bad to assemble. See customer image `lantern wire alignment'. Insert the wire expansion frame and make sure the bottom of the lamp opening lines up with the indents in the wire. On the top of the lamp you will see that one side of the wire loops is a bit higher. Rotating in from that higher side GENTLY turn the expansion frame and pull up the loops. This may take a couple of tries but worked for me. I had to remove one of the expansion frames and expand the slot that the light slides into with a screwdriver and reinstall since it was too tight (small). My set came with a spare paper lantern which I did not need yet along with two spare bulbs. It's not bad for $11."
4,Reliable radio,This radio has performed well for over 3 years for me. I use it when I am in my garden. The sound level and clarity is very good when used in the solar mode. I live in Southern California on the coast and on most daysI have no problem using solar mode even when it is a little overcast. I am going to buy another for my friend in South America who does not have electricity.
3,Pretty Good,"It's a good story although its rather long. In book 2 I actually liked Kambil but not anymore and I was surprised about Delin he didn't sound like the kind of person that was crazy but rather very controlled and smooth. I actually thought it would end at book 3 and now I have to find book 4 & 5, as if finding book 3 wasn't hard enough."
1,Questionable at best.,This book lacks semblance to anything whatsoever scientific. It most closely approaches the folk wisdom of third-world eastern medicine in the apparent foundation of its assertions. I contend that anyone using this book for more than mere entertainment would be severely misguided (although this begs the question of poisonous intentions).
2,"Save money, buy the 6th instead.","My professor used the latest (7th edition) in class. I got the 6th very cheap, so I used it. I could barely tell the difference. Save yourself some $$$ and buy the 6th edition used instead. They only made superficial changes from the 6th the 7th from what I can tell. The page numbering was off by like 1 page; all the cases were the same and they changed 1 or 2 (out of dozens) of the problems at the end of the chapters slightly. They just cranked out a ""new"" edition to sell more books.(Plus you're going to need to buy a study-guide anyway; this text isn't that helpful.)"
2,Almost Worthless,"I'm taking partnership tax. The instructor admitted on day one of class that the book is bad. Its examples are convoluted and not well developed. Its presentation of concepts are next to useless. It requires far too much effort on the reader's part just to understand the author's point. Its format is hard to follow for those not familiar with it. It lacks illustrations (except the one's I've drawn in the margins to aid future owners). The index might as well not even exist given its limited scope. The author assumes the reader has a background in legal terminology, great if you do but tedious to have to look up the definition of so many words. Moreover the author's use of nontechnical words requires English degree.One is better off reading the IRC and Treasury Regs directly (and free online).The author's editorial comments are precious though."
4,Delicious Horror,"The Old Woman's Cat is a delightful collection of 12 short stories, some wickedly funny, some full of dark revenge and tasty justice. ""Spectre"", a romance, was one of my favorites but ""Demise of a Vampire"" had me laughing and wanting more. ""Mother Mouse"", ""Skeleton Key"" and ""Images"" could be about the family next door (oh, you hope it isn't!), and ""Identity"" comes from our deepest fears of losing our own identity.These are delicious stories of ordinary folk just like you and me--with a twist from a good author. These stories will keep you shivering and looking at familiar things with new aprehension.It's also a must-have book for campfire nights!"
3,three stars is by no means a crime.,"I give this record only three stars, but I don't mean to say it isnt worth a listen - probably listen plural. I actually really enjoy a bunch of songs on this album, but I cannot say I enjoy it as an album. Some songs, which are there just for humor's sake get rather annoying after a couple of listens. the inevitable, doot doot pause - skip song, occurs...and then we discover that the album isn't long at all. Other songs are just so great, gloves, something I'm not, all of the actual song songs. Great songs, and you will definetly find a place for them on your mix tapes, or cds if you're technically hip, but as far as an album goes, meh - I can't give it the five that some of these songs deserve."
4,Las Vegas bound,"If you are going to Las Vegas, you get your money back and then some with the coupons in the back of the book. It helps if you are renting a car or driving, as many of the 2 for 1 offers are outside of the strip area. I have used this book for 3 years and told others about it - everyone likes it."
3,"Decent, but below expectations","Compared to its predecessor, ""Lesser of Two Evils,"" ""Slayers Special: Spellbound"" was a disappointment. The artwork is a notably more jumbled -- sometimes to the point of incoherent -- as many of the micro-episodes are more action-oriented (a carriage race, for example) which, in my opinion, doesn't flow particularly well on a manga page. They also (poorly) copied the Slayers season 1 episode introducing Prince Phil. This book isn't without merit -- the first 3 micro-episodes are quite well-done and consistent with the Slayers Special flow of silly action. Unfortunately, though, there are a total of 7 episodes in the book."
3,"The book seems to be authentic, but where is the truth?","The Book of Mormon has been backed up by this book, and its authenticy has been portraid, but i cannot see a truth in it except the truth that Jesus is alive.The evidence of America is there, but the evidence of the Holy God is not.The evidence of Joseph smith is there, but the evidence of Jesus Christ is not.As it is has been said by God, ""Satan will portray himself as a holy angel, and will put on the mask of a sheep, and will decieve many"".The Bible does not back up The Book of Mormon, and the rest of the' lost flock' are the gentiles....not only the American Indians, but also the Australian Indians, and the Asian Indians.Why didn't they recieve Jesus at the same time.I have come to the conclusion that The Book of Mormon is very much like the Islamic text, The Koran."
5,PINMONKEY,These guys are great and we are seeing the start of something special. Just like going way back and watching Sawyer Brown on Star Search. There is that special blending that you can't describe but it makes the music happen!
3,The Intrusive Paparazzi,"This installment is an atypical Morse. It is a straight ""who done it?"" which is quite good for that genre. Being completely void of the personal side of Morse and thus depriving us of our much anticipated diversions, we look to the paparazzi, who are covering the detective as opposed to the investigation, believing Morse will make better copy - but alas we are not privy to the published articles. The paparazzi - and there are many of them due to the prominence of the family involved - become quite an annoyance for Morse as does Superintendent Holdsby replacing our regular Superintendent Strange, who is on vacation. One murder follows another; however the persistent Morse -- after disposing of some ""red herrings,"" finds the thread that ties them together. My first viewing of this entry resulted in three stars -- subsequent viewing and reflection, led me to increase the rating to four stars. It is quite a good episode after all."
3,MISSED THE PUNCH,"QUALITY OF CD WAS DISAPPOINTING. IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER, I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THIS ITEM."
4,Complete History?,"I've searched, and so far, I have not come across a boxing (mainly Heavyweight) DVD, with more footage from the early years 1900-1950,than this one. The only one that comes close is the DVD ""The Kings of the Ring"".I realize, the earlier you go back, the footage will be horrible, limited camera views, but, its part of Boxing history, so, show it.In VHS, you can probably find a few good ones with older fights,if you look long enough.The footage is fair to good quality on most of them. Lots of fights on here too, from 1909 to the 1950s, maybe one from the early 60's.Going back to Jack Johnson, Jess Willard(Not fighting Johnson), James Braddock, Max Baer, Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey and many more.More DVD's like this, need to be released. I wouldn't call this the best, I'd call this one, the only one, with a more complete history of the early fights. Some of these might be considered rare fights, that you might not find on other DVDs.I say its worth the 10 dollars.Buy it."
2,bed support rail,"This bed support rail is not good. It does not lock into place, so when I get up and down it swings around. I think I can modify it to make it lock, but may send it back."
1,i have not receive this item yet its been 1 months,who ever in charge on the mailing items or selling books from this store sucks. I have not receive anything i purchase
3,Good Camera for the Price,"I purchased this camera for my wife because of it's ease of use (point'n'click) and the lense is automatically covered when turned off (protects lense in her purse or briefcase). It is a nice camera, easy to use, picture quality is OK (my daughter's Kodak 6340 and my Nikon 5700 pictures are much sharper), good camera for beginners. Batteries do not last long, pictures blurred with full digital zoom."
3,Nietzche being Nietzche,"Friedrich Nietzche is best known for saying ""that which does not kill us makes us stronger."" Personally I say ""never get your philosophy from a guy who ended up in a looney bin.""The golden age of Nietzche is probably 17 or 18 when some his insights sound great and you can simply wade through the rest of it. I cam late to Nietzche and, as you may have guessed, he leaves me cold.Still, if you're looking for an introduction to Nietzche you could do a lot worse than this book."
4,"Yes, it fits the Belle.","I bought this to use with my Belle baby carrier, and I'm happy to report it works. You can't use the loops as you would with a Bjorn because the Belle doesn't have any snaps to fit the loops over. Instead, use the two outer snaps on the hood to secure the straps of the Belle between the hood and the body of the cover. In other words, you have to use the hood even if you don't need it for warmth. The cover itself is well-made. It doesn't take the place of a warm bunting or jacket in the coldest weather, but it adds a nice layer of warmth and windproofing. My only complaint is that my baby can get her arms out of the cover quite easily, facing either in or out."
4,Really Good,We really like this carrier. We go for walks outside and he just goes right to sleep. We also use it around the house when he gets fussy.
3,not bad,"Very good, fantastic metal cover for your fragil ipod, BUT when you put the ipod inside the jacket you loose your ""necklace"" (because the ipod's bottom must goes out). I'm also concern about the ipod ""USB connection"" is exposed (the jacket's bottom is opened-I just dont know why!!)."
3,So-so DVD,"I thought this DVD was okay. The exercises are good exercises, but it felt as though Tracy switched from one to another somewhat too quickly. At times, I wanted to do more repetitions than what she did. The music was really boring, and although I thought the exercises were good, I can't really say I enjoyed this DVD. I will learn the exercises in the workout, and then do them on my own to my own music."
4,Good workout,This DVD helped me get over my plateau and loose the last 10 lbs of baby weight after my last pregnancy. Tracey's comments were enjoyable to enough to listen to day after day. It was particularly a great workout for the lower body. I loved that I could easily do this in my livingroom with only a 'toning tube' for equipment and still get great results.
2,"Okay, but inaccurate.","I liked ""Me on the Map"" MUCH better. I ordered the space book because the map book was very useful in explaining the concept of map representation to my four year old. This book simply wasn't as good. It is inaccurate, also, as it includes Pluto as a planet, though it is no longer considered to be one."
2,WARNING - not for children!!,"someone gave us a whole bunch of used books over the weekend, and my kids were going to read this, so i picked it up to see what it was talking about... this book is BAD! in a way this book has too much gory details about animal cruelty, your kids will most likely get nightmares and refuse to eat meat afterward...if a mature adult read it, it would perfectly fine, you can decide on your own future preference about animal cruelty... but for kids to get their hands on this book, it would be a big mistake!!at least it should have a big warning sign saying PG-13 or something..."
3,One Man's Dream and One Man's Destruction,"This book showed a man who had so much in life and yet couldn't enjoy it to the fullest. Kevin speaks of termoil and depression, love and addictions, and of his family.....I was part of his family and understood his passion. Kevin has been gone for almost a year now and he is dearly missed, his smile, his wit, his charming manner...I don't think Kevin knew he would write his own ending in one of his poems ""Someone Is Dying"", and we fulfilled one of his poems ""Full Circle"". I hope when you read the book, you'll feel the pain and struggle, the passion and love Kevin had when he was writing poetry....enjoy....Your family misses you...."
3,NOT for the CG-4!!,"Hey folks, this part is not for the CG-4 mount. It fits the CG-5 ""Advanced"" mount only.I've notified the seller to contact Amazon and get this fixed. There are two distinct part numbers from Celestron - 94223 fits the CG-4. 94224 fits the CG-5."
1,What are you getting?,"BE CAREFUL! I ordered this item through Amazon from High Point Scientific, which had the same ad and reviews found here for Adorama. In spite of what the other reviews say, the item I received was 94223, for the CG4 mount. When I called the vendor I was informed the 94224 would be an additional $3.00, so I had to return the 94223 with a check for $3.00 to get the 94224. With postage, that changed the total for the order from $44.75 to $50.65 -- significantly more than I could have purchased it for elsewhere."
4,"Excellent camera, slow start up time","I've been a heavy user of my camera since buying it in July, and it has proven to be a fantastic camera. It's light, it's rugged, it's survived rain storms, sandy beaches, banging against rocks as I've been hiking, etc. Having a rechargable lithuim battery saves a lot of money, and it's small size allows me to take it anywhere.My two problems with it are the slow slow start up time, sometimes you can't afford to wait ten seconds, the moment is gone. Also it takes a while to switch from settings, about another ten seconds sometimes.Overall I definitly recommend this camera to anyone."
3,"Great Camera, Short Life","I purchased this camera at Costco after doing some extensive research. I have had it for just under two years, and the flash has died. Since its out of warranty I would have to pay the repair, which is almost the cost of the camera. Its been a good camera, good picture quality, reliable, but I have had the same issue as other reviewers. If you bump the sliding cover while shooting a pic, the camera goes off. You have to wait until the battery is totally dead to recharge it. To erase a picture you have to go through an insane menu, and its soooo slow to go through and manually delete things, you might as well do it on your computer. But, it was faithful to me, and took good pictures for my scrapbooking. If you can reconcile spending $200 for a camera every two years or so, then its acceptable."
4,great camera,"THIS CAMERA IS GREAT, TAKES A LITTLE BIT TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE SETTINGS, GREAT PICTURES"
2,it's alright,"If you are looking for a pictoral chronology of Pininfarina's relationship with Ferrari, this book will cover the basics. Not much info. about the company or design work that goes on at Pininfarina-even though the title suggests it. Unfortunately, most of the pictures aren't real photos, but profile drawings instead. A little disappointing."
2,Ambient space-rock sound-babble.,"...and it's just plain boring. Although not bad, this is really nothing special. You might like these guys if you like RADIOHEAD, I, myself, need more juice."
3,Nice options,"I would not reccomend this product to anyone with a small car. It is very large and heavy, but it drives like a cadiliac and has many options. another thing that it does not have, that supprised me was cupholders for each child. It does have 2 for the parents though. All in all I am pleased."
3,Huge but Cool.,"Okay, I have 3 children and I am expecting Twins. AHHHH!!! Anyhow, my oldest is handicap and in a Wheelchair so the back of our Vehicle is already pretty full and there was no way that this stroller was going to fit. I have to admit if you can get past the sheer size and overwhelming firetruck red, it is awsome. I however returned it and purchased a Graco Quattro Tour Duo. Still big but not as. Good luck to all who purchase this just beware of the size and keep in mind that this stroller is best for the parents of one or two children not 5 =) !!!!"
3,decent size and good design,"the stroller is a little big and heavy since it is built for twin but if you don't mind that, it can be a good stroller. i like the many ways that we can arrange the seats, big and sturdy wheels, strong frame.. However, we wish the manufacturer include the 2nd car seat attachment to the package. I think most of the people who are buying this product have twin babies, it does not make sense to include only one car seat attachment. Plus, there is no way we can buy this car seat out there in the store. No body has the car seat attachment in stock.."
2,"It looks great, but performance disappoints.","I've owned this laptop for about eight months, and its battery life has dwindled to about 45 minutes, from a high of about two hours.I assumed that a Sony product would, at a minimum, have decent audio quality, but the speakers are so quiet-- even at full volume-- that headphones are a necessity.As a desktop replacement, this computer works fine. For basic internet browsing, email, word processing, iTunes playlist management, etc., it works fine. Still, away from the charger, this computer is basically useless, it's often slow, and shut-down takes an eternity.People compliment its sleek look, but I wouldn't buy this system again. The battery life is inexcusable, and SONY customer support was quick to tell me that they cannot and do not warrant battery performance.The sleek aesthetic comes at the expense of performance."
5,Good inkjet labels for CDs or DVDs,"Very uniform with a thin thickness and good adhesion. Decent contrast but not vibrant. Good quality , value, and ease of use."
4,Sydney Goes to Summer Camp,"Sydney ironically seems to have a real talent for ferreting out agents unloyal to SD-6. This was an entertaining read for die-hard fans of the TV series like myself, but would probably not hold the attention of a reader unfamiliar with the show."
3,Have more facts.,I will just say that it was too heavy with a 17 inch laptop inside - for my 13 year old granddaughter to lug around and it was returned for credit. One of the reviews had commented that with the shoulder strap - it was fine - but evidently carrying it over the shoulder with that big strap is not stylish for an 8th grade girl. Whatever....
5,Very useful,"My first exposure to Dreamweaver 3 was through the CD that comes with this book. (The CD also come with a trial version of Fireworks 3 and several other programs). I am very impressed with Dreamweaver and the explanations this book gives of its features. I'm about halfway through and I understand and can apply every bit so far.This is one of the first books out on Dreamweaver, so I was a bit wary of buying it. It's not for someone who knows absolutely nothing about web design (of course Dreamweaver isn't probably for someone who doesn't have at least *some* idea of what makes web pages work).If you want to learn Dreamweaver 3 and have had some exposure to web design, this book will teach you what you need to know."
4,smooth liquid,"mellow.... ambient.... seamless.... beautiful. A splash of Goldie, FSoL and Deep Forest - give it a quick stir. Add Mick Karn's distinctive bass playing. Et Voila! This is gorgeous. Buy it!"
5,Permutation identification,"Fans of Amon Tobin's ""Permutation"" will recognize the identical musical context. Mick Karn's playing is distinctive as always, but the project overall is the twin sister of Tobin's jewel. Yeah!If you like this, try Mick Karn's ""Bestial Cluster."" Guests on that album include David Torn, Ed Mann (of Zappa), and Joachim Kuhn."
1,"Washed out color, not true to original",Buy it from someone else. Had to send mine back because the colors were so bad.
5,A Gradual Descent into Life,"A beautifully written text. Begninning with a bullet-shaped punch, Thompson introduces new elements of the tale at precisely the right moments - the main character's initial 'flaw' becomes his saving grace, but in the end only serves to guide him into another story, one of which even his condition could not be aware. A novel about what it is to be blind to life, instead of being blind to light."
4,Incredibly Compelling,"I was amazed at the wonderful story which unfolded before me. From begining to end the book was an incredible tapestry of pain, loss and love."
4,"Despite the sadness, I kept reading","When I read this book, I remember thinking to myself how EVERY page had a reference to either death, illness, suffering, torture or some other terrible sadness. I also remember asking myself why I (or anyone else) wanted to continue reading and be exposed to all this. Something kept me captivated-maybe the writing, maybe the main character's strength or maybe both. For some strange reason, I really enjoyed this book."
5,Wonderful,"Well i already bought the first Arch. The first Arch i bought was of the cheaper version. And i must say that it seems wonderful. I love the series and if you do not want to pay the full price that is like a 120 dollars, then this version of the series would be great for you."
4,Another quality Bley trademark,"With all the great WATT's under her name, this recording from Carla is somewhat different in it's approach but still her trademark. Adding Larry Goldings on organ gives more punch to the the great hornsection with her longtimers Sheppard, Soloff and Valente (using daughter Karen Mantler on the organ on previous recordings was a mistake...). I have never considered Carla to be a great organist but her pianistic minimalism approach is definately her stronghold when playing the ebony and ivories. Great music and arrangements, 4x4 is another winner in the Bley catalogue."
3,Everything is Great Except One Big Thing,"I've had this for a few years now. It's worked as it should and hasn't shown signs of being cheaply made. Like someone else though, mine arrived with a big dent in it. It's on the back so I didn't mind since it didn't inhibit the rolling ability.One big problem:The screen has/gets ripples in it and it's impossible to ignore on panning movie scenes. It looks like underwater. I used to have this mounted in another room far away and it was harder to see, but now with my short throw projector, it's extremely obvious.I'm unsure if it is a defect, but I noticed another reviewer mentioned it. Something to keep in mind to be sure."
5,Essential reading,"Written by the English-speaking world's leading historian of Japanese military and political history, Samurai Warriors is a well-written and masterfully illustrated survey of the Heian to late Edo periods. The author, fluent in Japanese and well-versed with the historical texts, has written several other outstanding books and articles that the novice and specialist will profit from reading. Enjoy!"
5,An outstanding resource for both novice and experienced authors!,"Disappointed with my original POD publisher after a few misprints and doesn't have a distribution deal with Ingram, I eagerly read this book the day it arrived in the mail. Detailed, concise, and rather comnprehensive, this writer's resource has helped me focus on my short-term and longterm needs. I can't help but wish I had read this book two years ago!Like many other novice authors, I've clicked on website ads, downloaded submission guidelines, and found myself confused by the contracts. Worse, when I do get friendly sales representatives on the phone, I often feel that I'm not asking the right or best questions. I've been paralyzed by indecision.This resource has clarified my choices (Booksurge, iUniverse, Dog Ear Press, Infinity) and ruled out some that sounded quite attractive on the surface. Thank you!"
5,REVIEW OF FINE ART OF SELF PUBLISHING,"This book opened my eyes to the world of self publishing and saved me from making mistakes that could have been financially disastrous as well as professionally catastrophic.I applaud the authors honesty and dedication to the ""little guy"""
4,Great headphones,"Sennheiser has been known to make great products when it comes to mics and headphones, so I was excited to see these 'low budget' versions. I was looking for something to wear at work to just block out the noise around me and these are great. Excellent quality sound, doesn't make my ears sore or feel like they're going to fall off at any time. Very happy with the purchase.The only thing someone should be aware of is that they're a little tricky to get over your ears. The 'little arm' (we'll call it) is mostly immobile with the very end being flexible to extend out for you to slip it over your ear. I like the design, though, since that helps to keep them close to your ears.All in all, great product if you're looking for something to work out with (and get a little sweaty) or to use at work without the fear that someone will steal ""the good stuff."""
1,Flimsy Mask,"I ordered this expecting a total blackout for sleeping, but instead it turned out to be a cheaply made item that does not filter out all light rays. It's also a bit tight-fitting and makes my face feel smothered. The nose extension partially blocks air passage too. Not comfortable to wear at all. Placing a wash rag over my eyes would be more effective than this flimsy little mask."
3,Works for a while,"This eye mask is a good item, but over time (a few months) the bands that go around the head losen up and it makes it unusefull! I personally like the foam ones more than the fabric ones, but this one is OK to use!"
2,Cheap and poorly made,Ordered this mask for some role playing but it would not stay on my head. The strap on the mask broke after the first use as well. I am going to buy something else.
1,Much too tight to wear,Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask - BlackI bought 4 Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Masks directly from Dream Essentials. I don't know if the manufacturer shortened the length of the two elastic bands to save costs but all 4 masks are MUCH too tight to wear. Neither my wife nor I can use this sleep mask. It feels like someone tied a noose around our head over our eyes and is pulling the noose back really tightly. We don't recommend buying it.
1,Bad,"Like most people looking for a great night sleep during the day (namely us late shifters), I have become very particular in the sleep masks I like. This mask fails in every category. Light slips in from all sides (not just around the nose which is typical of cheap masks). What really surprised me however, is that in a dark room at night with just a TV on, I could see the light from the TV right through the front of the mask! As others have stated, it's incredibly tight on my head, and I woke up in pain from it. The material is light (normally a good thing), but somehow still abrasive to my skin. This is a cheap mask, and it performs as such. As an owner of 6 or 7 different types of masks over the years, this is without question the worst I have had. I was looking for complete darkness and comfort in material, as well as fit. This mask offers none of these."
1,These Things Are Awful-Don't Waste Your Money,"I gave this piece of crap merchandise one star only because there was no option to give them negative stars. They're flimsy, made of cheap material, in no way resembly the description on Amazon and are worth nothing. The people peddling these things should be ashamed of themselves. I'm convinced the postitive reviews on Amazon are written by the seller because no one in their right mind would write a good review."
2,I'm not so happy with this one,"I bought a couple of these masks when I bought the EarthTherapeutics sleep mask. I was surprised to discover that it was kind of a plastic or vinyl fabric, since the ad said it is ""silky soft."" Also, it doesn't do a good job blocking out the light. I bought a black one and a purple one, but neither one was good at completely blocking the light. What I did like about it was the double narrow straps. This was nice so you can adjust it more precisely."
3,does the job...,"the material is not silk. it is more like a thin plastic. if the room you are sleeping in gets a little warm, then this mask may make you a bit sweaty. overall, it does the job."
5,Superb drawing and images,"The type of art revealed within the pages of this portfolio is beyond mare words , one must gaze into the pages and immerse in to the wonderful world of Royu in order to fully understand the magic in his creation and his mind and hands. The first time i looked in to the pages of the book i felt as if i walked in to a world other then this one, and ever since i never wished to return , Royu has the power to send your mind to far and fictional places in a stroke of his brush - a true artist - in the full sense of the word !!!!"
5,Classic Royo,"I read the other reviews...it seems some of these people don't know Royo....this is Classic Royo: beautiful, dark and gothic-like, sexual.... it is not for those you blush at skin....but for the lover of gorgeous women and wild monster and magnificent art....if you love royo or know someone who does...get it! it is worth every cent and then some.... and the heck w/ ""stories"" behind the paintings....you got an imagination...USE IT!!!! that is the intent of pretty much any artist: they want you to think and use that brain and imagine...you want a story, go buy fairytales or something! this is for someone who loves art and had imagination!"
5,True Goddess,My favorite perfume by far! The quantity for the price is a FIRE SALE! Absolutley worth every penny.
5,Mathis at His Finest,"If you grew up with the sound of Johnny Mathis, you will LOVE this recording. To me, thiscompilation represents the very best of his earlier work, which, in my opinion, is the bestof Johnny Mathis. Everything from ""Year After Year"", ""Early Autumn"" to ""Chances Are"", ""Teacher,Teacher,"" will delight you. You will not be disappointed if you are a true fan, as I havebeen. His voice is utterly smooth, sensitive, romantic -- boy, did that guy have thechops to pull of some of these standards. Buy it!"
4,Cute Rom-Com.,"It's a cute Rom-Com, 90s style. The characters and situations come off as real. The premise doesn't. But then, this is a Romantic Comedy, so that's a given. Nuff said."
4,"""I can't believe I can be such a ham!""","Ever fall in love with your best friend? Only he doesn't care about you? But he seems to now? and wait! Your best friend is the same gender as you? Confused?...Don't be...sort of.. This delightful comedy of errors touches on many subplots with a nice balance, if a tad overlong at spots. Performances are refreshingly candid and light. I specially liked Tuc Watkins as the befuddled lover who gets dumped by a very believable Alexis Arquette. Very nice soundtrack courtesy of the Partridge Family. See it."
4,Before Alexis Arquette was a woman,"So, this movie was made before Alexis Arquette had transitioned from male to female. It is astonishing to see her back when she was a handsome, masculine dude named Robert. Masculine, now, not butch. I saw this movie back in the 1990s, forgot about it, and rented the other day. It has held up surprising well. The wonderful Lauren Velez and Tuc Watkins turn in great comedic performances. And Alexis is lovable as the neurotic, slightly nebbishy gay boy who has a crush on his allegedly straight roommate. Fun footnote: I lived in Washington, DC, when this film was made, and where it was set. The movie captures accurately the look and feel of Georgetown during the William Jefferson Clinton epoch."
4,A First Date Movie,"This feel-good movie is one to keep aside for a first date. It has everything, comedy, yearning, jealousy, hope, and a wonderfully endearing ending,."
5,MUST HAVE,This is a must have if you own a telescope. It uses a little red laser like led dot to alighn your scope to whatever object in the sky you need to find or focus on
1,don't buy as you can't repair it,"Nice short toilet, but one problem. It is impossible to change the toilet seat. They use a non-standard connection that requires a $50 kit just to get the screws out. Think about having to replace the whole toilet in 5 years just because of the seat."
5,Well illustrated and written.....,"I convene a Scottish Clan Tent at various Highland Games, and this is always prominantly displayed on my table.It gives a quick, but thorough history on the Scottish Border Reivers for those of use who don't have time to read the Steel Bonnets. The illustrations alone are worth the price of the book."
5,Best game of 2004,This game is going to be great al the new girls and cars and guns! This game sould be rated #1 game of the year and if you have ever played Nightfire and Agent Under Fire you would know that all Bond games are good and so will this one!
4,From 007 to 001?,"Ok, don't get me wrong, this is a great game.Yeah, you actually get to see yourself. But why is it only 4 stars? Well first of all, 2 player is the worst. Yes, co-op isn't to bad, but it is sooooooo hard. 1-player is great though, you get to drive, you have cool gadgets, yes but it just doesn't stand out like the rest. If you ask me though, Everything or Nothing, may not be on the top ten best games of all time, but its in the ball park."
4,An amazing 007 game,"I had wanted this game forever. I have it now and it rocks. I rate it four stars because it's not like I'm that crazy about it. It has great graphics, definintly the best 007 game by a longshot, not as good multiplayer action, but overall better than nightfire!!"
2,"""Waste"" (please) End Horror!","After enjoying ""7 % solution"" as a manna sent from heaven, I tasted stale bread in reading the aforesaid title. It was a huge let down, in terms of everything. The theatrical environs made the work overtly sensational and reduced Holmes' stature(can you imagine it?)to that of a novice trying to assess the world with the help of GBS. Sorry, but I just can not digest it."
3,Goes down well.,"I'm not sure who put this collection out, but with a name like Double Shot, I'd think it was Starbucks idea. There must be 200 alternative collections out there at this point, but this one does a pretty decent job. Of 24 tracks on 2 discs, the majority is good. The best of the first disc is from Seven Mary Three, Afghan Whigs, Screaming Trees, and Spacehog. My picks from disc two are from Ministry, Porno For Pyros, L7, and Dinosaur Jr.. The bottom line is that I've seen better compilations, but if you find this used for about the price of a double-shot, get it."
3,"Okay candle, but pricey.","I bought a six pack of these candles. They burn evenly and down to the bottom of the jar and smell fine, not too strong. But the price is just too high, in my view, for something I burn up and have only an empty jar left. I can buy equally good candles and jars for less."
1,Pure [junk],"I could play a better James Dean than Casper. I cannot even believe they chose him, I find that so insulting. This movie [stinks] royally and thats that. And for once could we please have an honest hollywood film about his LIFE no fiction added romance.... EVERYONE KNOWS he was bisexual... whats the big deal? I think its okay to make a film about that as well as all the other real things he did and what he delt with. Enough of this low budget trash."
5,Awesome,Fits perfect with my knit cap or wit out. An bought one for a friend she loves hers also.everyone loves our pink hard hats an all the ladies want one. I told them go to amazon.com.
1,"BEWARE Trojan in ""updated"" files","Provided (on disk) software didn't work with Windows 7, updated software from their site had Trojan as reported by AVG and Spybot."
5,Richie Stephens,"I have previously heard most of his albums - Sincerely, Perfect Love, Buff Baff and others. I just recently heard the album ""Richie Stephens"" by Richie Stephens. It's a truly great album, He is a great songwriter and delivers quality music. Great songs, no vulgarity. He is strictly Lovers Rock. I wish him all the best in his music career.Sincerely,Proud to be a Jamaican"
4,Great,Strap was for my daughter. She was using another brand I ask her to try this one. She liked this one as well if not better than the one she had.
5,Works well!,"I have a couple of the knee straps. I do not have severe knee pain, however. Either I have a fat calf or these run a little on the small side."
5,Excellent knee band,"I have been using a knee band like this for the last 6 years. My old ones finally wore out so I replaced them with exactly the same brand. It is great for knee problems, especially chondromalcia patella. I am a regular runner and don't ever run without my knee bands in place."
5,A Must For Synthetic Oil,These filters work great in my 2010 F-150. Coupled withRoyal Purple 12520 API-Licensed SAE 5W-20 High Performance Synthetic Motor Oil - Pack of 12I went over 6000 miles before the onboard oil life monitor got down to 10%! The benefits of synthetic oil are only truly realized when you use high quality filters like these. Will definitely buy more.
2,Nice case but,"This is a nice case and looks like it would do the job of protecting my iPod BUT, it basically renders my 400$ speaker set useless. The iPod won't dock now in the speaker's dock because of the case. And it is way too tough to get the case on and off to be practical. Something has to give."
4,Pure Acoustic Guitar -- Very Nice ! !,"Rich Dixon creates an excellent Christmas guitar album, that I enjoy listening to all year long. It brings peace to any busy day.This album was originally released in 1998 by Intersound/Platinum Entertainment under the title ""Christmas At Home -- Carols For Solo Guitar"".A real gem of pure acoustic guitar.Faithful to the original spirit of each Christmas Carol.The only thing that would make it better, is just more of the same !!!"
5,Measure!!,Just and FYI.....Great product but be sure you have enough space in your cupboards for these. I have half shelves in the back above the bottom shelves that prevent me from using these the way I had intended. I was unable to push the rack as far back as I would've liked and still have room for inserting and removing the items in the rack with ease. So I had a lot of rearranging I needed to do to make these work for me. The products themselves are great though.
2,The real monster is how bad this game is!,"There's no denying that Monster House for the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube does a good job of duplicating the atmosphere of the movie it's based on. Every key scene from the movie is represented in some fashion, and the game's spooky musical score is on par with Hollywood's best. Unfortunately, while the game is a joy to sit back and take in, it isn't much fun to interact with. The movie has been transformed into a third-person action game that mainly involves fighting the same cookie-cutter enemies over and over again in the same cramped environments. To make matters worse, various other dubious design decisions bring about fits of frustration along the way that really shouldn't be in a game that only takes about four hours to complete."
4,Well Written and Scholarly,"David Haggith's gift to us is a scholarly compendium of end time prophecies of the Bible. The book is basically a history book, alternating between history and references from the Bible that contain some type of apocalyptic message. On occasions one gets the feeling that Haggith is stretching history to fit the prophecy, but generally speaking he avoids this trap.This book is very very good. To have made it excellent, I would have liked some discussion of the end time genesis itself. Why was there so much obsession with end time philosophies? How did the Jews compare with other cultures in this regard? How did the philosophies change over time? etc.This book is written so well that almost anyone will enjoy the contents. Familiarity with the Old Testament and Jewish culture in general will make it even more valuable."
2,"Scent is too strong, leaves sticky residue","I love all natural products, but not this one. The smell is overwhelming. It leaves a sticky residue. It doesn't even seem all natural to me."
4,BLACK-Coleman Liquid-Fuel Lantern Hard-Shell Carry Case,"This case works great for both of my ""Powerhouse"" lanterns.The 1st shipment came w/o the bottom. The card-stock with the UPC code and product description hangs from the knob at the top and they probably didn't notice. Anyway, with Amazon, the exchange was quick and easy.When using it be sure to *SNAP* the bottom 2 latches before you pick up the whole unit. Otherwise it could ruin your trip.It protects your lantern very well when packing it in the truck/trunk from minor crush from top and sides, but it doesn't really protect it from falls. It is fantastic for storage. After I bought this to try it out, I bought another.It has a small storage space at the base for add'l socks. I keep a grill lighter inside too."
5,Best ever,Love Albert King. Love the chatter between songs. SRV seems like such a student. Which is so humble and normal. Musically flat out awesome. Super cool CD.
5,Passin it on,Saw this on tv years ago. Was glad to find it on my search of some old Albert King. Really cool!
4,"Different layout, different sounds, who cares?","Pac-Man and ET were the two games for the Atari to cause the ""end"" of videogames. But I don't understand what's wrong with the game. So what if the maze is different? So what if the graphics are different? So what if the sounds are different?At least the gameplay is the same! You guide Pac-Man around, munching off all the dots in the maze.The sounds are beeps and bops. Like how every Atari game has them.There's no music.I mean, seriously. People are making a big deal out of nothing. This game is good the way it is."
1,"The Age of Extremes, A twentieth -Century Life","It is hard to believe that this book,""autobiography"" is written by one of the gratest living historians.Not because of the awkward sentences but because of the obvious lack of depth. It consists of an endless parade of the names of his friends who are embodiment of intelect,dedication and idealism of Communism.The author himself so often unabashedly proclaims himself ""intelectual"",with all atributes of moral superiority.But what is the content of this moral superiority? What is the ideal of Communism? On these points the author is silent."
3,Tiny Book Light,"This is a useful little light that does not give off a huge amount of light but would be okay for reading in bed, on a plane or anywhere else you did not want to wake or disturb others. There are other, better booklights but they are bulkier and heavier."
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this item. I purchased one for a trip to Europe for use on the plane as well as other times. When I got the item, it worked fine. I put it away with the items I would be packing. By the time I went to use it the first time, the batteries were dead. I got new batteries, put them in and the unit worked again. The next day, the batteries were dead again. I will be returning the unit for a refund."
4,Exciting,James Bond features tons of cool action sequences with motorcycles and cars! Hand to hand combat is a blast and the all new co-op mode is awesome for you and your friends. Its unlike any other game because it makes you use your head along with all the shooting and action from other Bond games! The only negative comment I would add is that it is too hard at some points in the game. If you use your brain this game will be among your favorites!
4,Awesome,"NHL 2004 is the best hockey game I have ever played. I love games where they have simulated gms and this desire is satisfied with the dynasty mode. I am used to being able to make trades and sign free agents but allowing me to set ticket prices, manage attendance, and dealing with player happiness and practice sessions is an awesome feature.My only knock on the game is when they say they give you 20 years for you to create a dynasty, it really does take almost that amount of time to do it. If you do not simulate each game and you actually play each one, you have millions of hours of entertainment ahead of you. Also they don't really tell you how the minor league system works or what some of the stats are for. So it's kinda a guessing game from that standpoint.Otherwise, this is an awesome hockey game and has provided me with days of entertainment."
3,Uneven but worth a listen,"I came to Zero 7 somewhat late in the game, when I picked up the Garden State soundtrack. ""In the Waiting Line"" prompted me to acquire Simple Things, which had a mello modern sound that I really liked. So it was a no brainer to grab The Garden.Zero 7 comes off the tracks a little bit on this disc, however. For lack of a better word, The Garden is a bit ""zanier"" than Simple Things. Perhaps emboldened by the success of their last album, the band seems to have taken greater risks on this disc. It works well in some parts, particularly where Jose Gonzalez takes the vocals -- ""Today,"" for example -- but I found some of the other songs cumbersome and reptitive (""Pageant of the Bizarre""; ""This Fine Social Scene"") or simply unmemorable. This disc has more personality than the last, however, and is worth a listen."
3,Largely Disappointing from a Promising Group,"What a bummer. I LOVE both Zero 7's first two albums, and I jumped for joy when I saw The Garden in stores. Unfortunately, with the exception of two songs - Throw it All Away and Today - the album is a jarring, repetitive, overly-produced and techno-dependent headache. I don't quite understand what happened - on each of their other albums, there is one song I find sounds like nails on a chalkboard, and that I either skip over or don't include in mixes. On this one, that's true of all but two. For anyone newly introducing themselves to Zero 7, PLEASE do not start here - it's likely you won't explore any further. For those of us who are/were already pretty loyal fans, support them by purchasing the CD, but don't expect to like most of it."
5,"Lo máximo, Genial, muy , pero muy Bueno",Hace tiempo no escuchaba un disco tan bueno. Tan motivador como Simple Things. Hace tiempo no escuchaba un trabajo tan bien hecho. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.
1,Very Disappointing,"I've been a longtime Zero 7 fan, they broke amazing ground with their earliest work but the current legacy isn't even worth the name. If you expect them to live up their best, this album will leave you very disappointed."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I would suggest you purchase the tiger woods 2003 version instead. The tiger woods 2004 version comes with 2 discs instead of one, and you have to keep switching between them. When you do come to the last person to beat (tiger woods), you play on tiger woods' ""dream 18"" which means that you have to switch between discs over 5 times to finish 18 holes. You have no idea how annoying that can be. When you play the international tour, every time you play in a new country the disc needs to be switched. The graphics seem to have gown down a bit too! The announcers say a few new things, but gameplay is so easy that you'll beat it in days. I would suggest you stick with tiger woods 2003 instead of spending the big bucks to get the 2004 version. There are just too few improvements."
5,Great game!!,"How the Heck did such a good game come out that is a first person shooter for the GC. The multiplayer is great with the addition of new AI for you to battle with but I think there should be a capture the flag mode. The graphics are great and the old freaky MOA frontline music is also back. The story is really great and you want to keep going to get to the next cut seen. It is fun to now use the new wepons including jap weapons and my favorite the one shot kill welrod. If you love nightfire, the other MOA games or Battlefield 1942 you will love the months of entertainment this game brings!"
4,Oh this is lady's night,I liked this story to the fullest. But it was just that ending. Somehow I wanted more. But overrall the story was off the hook.
2,Disney Party,"I bought this game for my six year old daughters birthday, but what a confusing game! I thought it would kind of be like Mario Party - which is pretty easy to play for little kids. I'm an adult and had a hard time getting the gist of the game. It's not very interactive, you don't get to move along a board - it does it for you. Some of the games are fun, but the explanations on how to play are sometimes vague. Even set on easy the computer players are kind of hard. (For a six year old) I wasn't overly impressed with this game, and after Kindom Hearts, kind of dissapointed that Disney would make such a lame game. In my opinion I wouldn't waste the time or money on this game."
3,This CD gets 3.5 stars it does not have many songs,There are only 4 songs on this album they are all good but I advise them to release with there 1st album in a remastered format that would be great anyway.Jayou-Concrete Schoolyard andAction Satisfactuion are good but it's like having so cake and after you eat 4 bites you need to buy some more.Where is the whole cake it is on there 2 full CDs make a best of with this
5,Delightful Monarch puppet,Monarch Madness has been satisfied by this delightful and surprisingly durable puppet. Wings are light enough to respond to a gentle hand motion.
3,As good as it gets,"This book is as good as it gets. Which does not say much. I took it on a recent dive trip to SE Asia and was able to determine generally what I was seeing. The photos are good. However, there are insufficient descriptions - nothing on habitat and nothing to differentiate juveniles from adults - to ID species. And there were lots of animals underwater that were not listed. But the other available texts were no better.I searched for months of find a good fish ID book. I concluded there's just nothing out there. So while this is as good as it gets, that's not a lofty endorsement."
3,Not so complete.,"I found the book to be a good general guide for a beginning home detailer. As a car enthusiasts, many of my questions were not answered. I also feel that product and tool recommendations are outdated. The book is well-written and easy to read. A good start for beginners"
1,Wrong Game,Thought it would work on Xbox 360 Kinect but it is telling us we need another hard drive. I'm not going to buy something else.
1,WOW! how Stupid!,"You gotta be pretty dumb to play this game 24/7! I turned it on, didnt understand one thing going on. Racing games need a new edge. They have AWESOME graphics, no doubt, but they lack a good time. I thought this was a terrible game. Dont get this game. EA sports has done a great job with madden and nba live, but this was a big disapointment! Later"
4,FIFA 2004 steps it up...,"After being glued to the TV with Fifa 2003, it was a strange switch to Fifa 2004, at first. The day I bought the game I wanted to return it immediately. The game play was slow, the players seemed immobile and scoring was not easy. In 2003 I would play World Class at the highest speed and win with ease, but not 2004. But after playing a bit the game does speed up and becomes much smoother to play. The graphics are outstanding, the Off the Ball Control is a great asset and it has now taken the place of Fifa 2003 on my shelf. It is dificult to play at first, but once you work with it the possibilities seem endless. The downfall: 1 on 1's. The right toggle stick does perform a move, but rarely works to get past a defender. Oh well, pass around em, right? Anyways its a great game and you should have it no doubt."
1,Not necessary if you're very careful!,"These companies are just trying to make a buck on those who are careless with the screen! I have had my DS for over a year now and clean both top and bottom screens regularly with a soft lint-free cloth. Sometimes I dampen it with just a small bit of glass cleaner if needed. I admit that there are a few very small light scratches on the bottom screen, but only noticeable when my DS is off and I'm looking closely. Save $5.00 with regular cleaning and careful use!"
5,Yet another super album,"This is a MUST BUY. Even though I didn't know any of the songs, like I did on Saturate, this album is just as great. In some ways even better (if possible!)If you're only buying ONE cd this year, I'll suggest this one ... Even though the year's still new.KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK, JEFF!!!!"
1,Amazingly bad. Maybe worse.,"I have all of Joan Jett's albums, including her stuff with The Runaways. I've seen her live five times and she is, without a doubt, an exceptional performer. That being said, this is her worst effort. Even her live performances on this CD fall flat. A waste of money. A waste of time. A major disappointment."
2,Arch,"Interesting choices, but inadequate, often unreadable plans make any serious understanding of the prjects impossible."
4,NHL 2004,"Hey,i am 12 years old and i have been a hockey player for 8 years. I am an all-american hockey player. Meaning i have colledge scouts looking at me already! Well enough with the small talk,so as you can see i must know alot about hockey. Well this game is VERY realistic and is really quite true by all of the plays. The player also look alot like they really do in real life too(which is wierd to see in a game)The game isnt like the other NHL games seeing it doesnt have big hits and like shot clocks. This is very different from the others because it has 36 European teams. You can also make your own team and create your own rink,but best of all you can make your own players.Overall this is a great game and i hope many of you gamers will decide to go and check this game out after reading my review. Have a good time to all you new buyers to this game,hope you enjoy iy..........oh, and by the way. If you ever have the chance to sign up for hockey take the chance! :)"
3,wrong description,This microphone for all intents and purposes is a great deal : great price and a very good product. However I ordered two and contrary to the description the microphones sent to me were SILVER and should have been BLACK which is the ideal color for blending in a video so I am sending them back. Too bad as I looked forward to getting these in use immediately.
2,"Poor packaging, damaged product","Product arrived on time (actually a day early) so was excited to get it set up as the final piece of a home theater installation. Imagine the disappointment to see a hefty dent in the casing, right in the middle, in the side that faces the room. So, no matter, I thought - it's just a cosmetic defect.Boy was I wrong! The dent there made it impossible to retract the screen. No matter how much we tried, we could not get the screen back into the case. Had to return the product.That said, Amazon took the product back without fuss, hence the 2 star (rather than 1 star) rating. Unless the seller can show evidence that they can get their packaging sorted out and validated (listen up Da-Lite- there are tests you should run to validate/iimprove your packaging....) - I will not buy from them again."
2,screen,screen has a large wrinkle on the right side which distorts the picture. No information for problems or contact information was included with the product.
2,Will not roll up!,It's really difficult to roll this thing back up once it's been pulled down - in fact we've given up! Great if you like pulling your hair out...
5,So excited...,"Finally this hidden 80's movie is coming out! For some very cool reason so far 2 of my favorite 80's movies are getting the DVD treatment this one and The New Kids! Wow, this is so great. The next one I'm hoping for is Modern Girls. Anyway, I have this movie on VHS but it plays horribly now. Now I can watch it perfectly again and again and again."
4,Almost wonderful ...,"One of the good things about Accuradio is that you can sit here in Europe at your computer and listen to classical music from an american angle. Other ensembles, other soloists, other arrangements ... Without that possibility I would never have stumbled upon the Imani Winds. This is a very fine cd with a perfect sound and some very fine arrangements played just wonderfully. And I agree in all the superlatives from the other reviewers - but with this one reservation: Some of the arrangements are being played just this little bit too fast that the overall impression becomes a little shallow. Mostly Ravel, but also a few of the other compositions. I like the cd, but every time I listen to it I just have this little itch: Couldn't they dive a little bit deeper into the music instead of just playing it perfectly? - But go ahead, buy it. Most likely you'll love it!"
4,Diverse music hits the spot,"Chris Randell began to explore new and exciting sounds with the album BURN which was the first he produced on his own. With the next release he created a modern masterwork of pure rock and industrial dance grooves.He has gone further into that groove on (R)Evolution. There are the standard rock heavy tunes like SMASH YOUR RADIO and CARBON COPY, but soon there after his interest in blues, jazz and even a little funk creep in and really begin to influence the music, and for the better I might add.If you want music that stays in one very particular corner, never venturering to break its reigns then go elsewhere. But if you brave, soulful industrial rock, then SISTER MACHINE GUN is your ticket to ride."
5,FingerPrints,"When I read this book it feels like I am one with Anthony ,Rae , Yana , Jesse and the rest of the people in this book. In this Book so far that I am reading Rae is finding out people know about her secret. She can read peoples thoughts when she touches their finger prints. She puts mush (dog stuff) on her fingers when she is around anthony because she dosnt want to get any of his (bluebird) thoughts. Anthony teaches Rae how to swim and she teaches him on how to read better (he has dislexia). And Anthony's father split when he was little and Rae found him in Jail. She tried to tell Mr. Tony Facinelle that Anthony wanted to see him but he got mad and told her if he ever Had anthony go there he would never talk to him ever.Thats all I have read in this book. If you like Mystery stories and stuff go out and get finger prints! But you have to read # 1 first and read them all in order or else you will get confused!Best books I ever readSammi"
5,Early 1980's issue of this fanzine,"The Duckburg Times was a fan magazine, based on the works of comic book artist Carl Barks. He was a Disney animator who in 1942 begin to write and draw Donald Duck stories for Western Publishing. Along the way he created new characters like Uncle Scrooge and Gyro Gearloose, and new villains like the Beagle Boys. Disney comics did not allow the artists name to be displayed, so for decades Carl was known to his fans as ""The Good Duck Artist"".People that were interested in getting info on Barks formed clubs, groups, companies, and fanzines. This fanzine was started by Paul Anderson, who also published Vacation in Duckburg, and went on to create the phenomenal magazine about the legacy of Walt Disney in film and theme parks, ""Perspective of Vision"". He also wrote the book, ""The Davey Crockett Craze"".But Frank and Dana Gabbard took over this publication with issue #8 and also did a fine job."
1,not what I ordered,The photo shows a puppet larger than an adult human hand. What I received is smaller than half an adult hand and is intended for your fingers. Doesn't have legs or antenna as shown in photo. Will be returning it.
2,Threads are crappy,Threads are crappy. I am a auto mechanic and I deal w/ threads everyday and even I have problems starting them.
2,silly but cheerful and with a certain charm,"You have to be willing to swallow a fairy godmother to like this one. Oddly, since I do not like magic as a plot device, I fond the fairy godmother rather charming. It was the fact that all of the other charaters behaved like complete imbecils that was off-putting. Ms. Bennett is a smooth writer, she moves the plot along like clock-work, so very much like clock-work, in fact, that the characters appear to be well-oiled automatons going through the motions of falling in love with all the emotion of mechanical dolls."
3,it's alright but not great,this thing has an option to take the voice off when doing karaoke but it's no good so it's only good for singing to karaoke songs already on there and u can only transfer to the xbox and not back to the computer which really sucks
1,GARBAGE,I bought this because it said I could transfer MP3 and pictures to my xbox. This has been done successfully three times. I repeatedly have problems with it not being able to connect to my PC. The interface is clunky. Save your money and get a linksys media adapter. This is but another example of Microsoft stealing a good idea and ruining it.
1,It sucked so bad that I couldn't even watch it all,"WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN:The ONLY way they could sell this move is to put these two guys on the cover, two guys that I've known from other successful movies . What waste."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"The Dilemma was OK. I have never really liked Vince Vaughn, but he was actually very good in it. The movie wasn't particularly funny, but it had a good storyline. I found it very basic and much longer than it had to be. It is what it is, just your typical ordinary romantic comedy. Not really my thing..."
2,Pulped Dilemma?,"Talk about false advertising seriously quoting a hilarious film that isn't very funny unless the viewer's mentality is that of Pulp Fiction. The reel could have been better because the dilemma is very dramatically portrayed as well as Vince Vaughn's performance. It is scary and violent at moments, and an unexpected Oh my g-d I cannot believe this is happening especially the intervention. Wyonna Rider plays a serious cat and player where the film could have turned sinfully evil. There is a humorous scene at the hockey facility where an argument takes place right in the middle of getting beer. Jennifer Connally plays her perpetual role and can be a downer. The movie gets confusing as to whether or not this is based on a love relationship and engagement or the significance of being best male friends. I felt the engagement was Rider's diversion and the gambling addiction needed to be developed to grab the audience more; however, that may be the pulp at the end of my orange juice."
2,Disappointing,"This movie boasts a talented cast but the script is terrible. In the movie, our main character played by Vince Vaugh tries to tell his buddy played by Kevin James, that his spouse is cheating on him.The scenes are over the top with Vince beating up the boyfriend, following Kevin's character to a house of pleasure, making a really disgusting toast at an older couple's anniversary celebration etc. Queen Latifah's role was ridiculous and Vince comes across as a buffoon.It was not comedy by any means. It was dark, unpleasant and joyless.I would rank it as one of the worst movies I have watched. I give it 2 stars because I watched the whole thing wondering how bad it could get.Ron Howard is usually quite brilliant, I am really surprised he would put this out there."
2,Wait and learn.,"I'm a die hard Bionicle fan but I was disappointed by this game. In Phantasy Star Online the graphics are great and that is the game I have been playing, so it appears they stink in this game. Plus I get bad-tempered easily so I got mad at it eventually because I can't beat the Bohrak with Tahu. I wish it started out easier(I also didn't have the instructions because I rented the game and maybe that made it harder too)"
2,"Wait, what?","The software is not at all user friendly, well, unless you like just doing flashcards. The direction and next step is not clear when you complete a unit, even after watching the guided tour multiple times. I agree with the other reviews about the audio CD's - if you would like to get familiar with hearing French then fine. If you want to actually function and learn what they are saying, forget it. My favorite is in disk one when you have no instruction on HOW, the lady says ""ok answer this XYZ question in French"". Ahhh, what now?"
1,Horrible,"I installed this on a Mac and didn't have trouble with the installation, just had trouble with the interface and content. There is absolutely nothing intuitive about this program. I am returning it tomorrow."
3,Not for the beginner!,"This book is definately for the experienced costumer - and for somebody who is deeply interested in researching fashion in this era.It is a book that is full of detailed descrption, although the lack of colour illustrations is definately a minus. I had hoped that with the re-issue the photographs would have been re-taken in colour.I found it to be very useful, but definately not something to sit down and read - it is definately a ""study"" type of read."
4,Wonderful book,"This book is full of well researched history into the life of Rasputin and the history surrounding his existence. The book is obviously well researched. However, at times the book seems poorly constructed and verbose. I could not escape the feeling that DeJonge looked for small, insignificant things to fill pages. Also, the book's time line jumps around a bit, particularly at the beginning. Overall, though, the book works, and is the best of all of the biographies of Rasputin that I have read."
2,PLAYMOBIL Black-ckad Ghost,"This is a PLAYMOBIL black ghost. Actually a guydressed up as a trick or treating Halloweencostume of a black-clad ghost. Only the eyes andmouth glow-in-the-dark. He carries a bag. But hedoes not look like a ghost to me. Ghosts are NOTdressed up in black. I cannot recommend this.Only those who want a black-clad character wouldbuy it.------ A better buy would be the PLAYMOBILVampire.----- Luisa Felix, [...]"
3,I like it a lot,"OK this is a kids book and a real simple one too, but it has come in real handy when I was explaining things about the Ancient Egyptian Pantheon to my colleagues at University. LOLI think it is simple, yet it gives just enough information for someone to understand the pantheon (of course not in academic terms)."
1,this game will NOT rock,"i know i havent played the game yet, but if it is like its prequel and other extreme sports games like tony hawk and dave mirra, this game will be RUBBISH"
4,ssx 3 has done it again!,"i got this game for christmas 2 years ago and i have NEVER stopped playing it!!! did you guyz see the snowboard that you can buy now...instead of using a controller you use an actual snowboard!!! i want it REAL BAD!! anyway back to the game i have the original one..SSX Tricky, same thing except this one is a whole lot better. what i mean is the graphics and stunts are better than the 1st one"
3,"""Z"" MOVIE WITH ""A"" SPECIAL EFFECTS","The plot of JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN could have been the subject of a good sci-fi novelette but is too weak for a 100 minutes movie. The idea is the following : there is a symmetric earth behind the sun. So why not go there and see what's on this planet.Actors are very serious, the clothes very 1970 in an action set at the beginning of the 21st century I presume. But what is truly a surprise in this movie is the quality of the special effects ; in my opinion, they are the best I have seen, except for 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY of course, in a movie of the sixties. You have to see the final explosion to understand what I mean.Special features reduced to the minimum : english subtitles and a scene access.A curious DVD curious A."
3,Cyclopean spy is best part!,"Some really fun moments w/Herbert Lom as a one-eyed spy and the pre-CG FX are quite well done for the time, but unfortunately most of the FX deal w/stuff that became dull reality just a few years later (countdown and liftoff procedures, etc) Loved this when I was a kid but gotta say it just doesn't pack much wallop today..."
5,Excellent Sci-Fi Film capping the 1960's,"Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (later of Space:1999 fame)do an excellent job with their first live action featured film. A combination of good effects for the time (interesting model work) and good acting lead to a tense journey to find out the secrets of the planet on the Far Side of the Sun. A ""twist"" climax, as well as a somewhat artistic ending leave this as one of the better sci-fi films of that decade.The DVD itself has very clear visuals, although the audio at times isn't quite as cleaned up."
3,Travel to find your home,"This Journey is a search in reverse, pardon the pun. It is a discovery of a world where everything depends on your perspective and vantage point. Close your eves before you blur your vision. Our travellers leave and find they share a portion of a universe not so unique, that they aren't unique and how everything is in perfect balance - not what we tell ourselves! We need to be special, and existing 'on purpose'. When you have a double then what purpose fits? Perhaps to just be different again, or just to get back where you belong. Can we cope with the wierd discoveries that space travel risks?"
2,OK if you tend to like this sort of thing.,"Very slow moving film. Simple plot. Wooden acting. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson sure do a great job with the effects, but really, come on,the script works off of one idea.The DVD looks great: sharp, the color is wonderful."
2,The voice of a madman....a really boring madman...,"This book starts off in a blaze - a depressed and clearly unhinged old man about to off himself, muttering, fumbling for words, growling at the universe. But once he decides to kill himself with a handgun, a computer glitch puts his plan on ice. He's forced to wait a few days to get the handgun. This delay give the narrator enough time to reconsider his plan and instead direct his rage at others. About half way through, the book lapses into almost incoherent mumbling. The narrator loses his edge with each kill. Instead of rising to a misanthropic pinnacle, he fades away into boring murkiness. Despite the 200 pages, I had to force myself to finish. yawn."
3,I Wouldnt read it again,"Don't get me wrong the general idea is very good, its a great topic. But the whole book is clearly a rant. At the begining i really enjoyed it but as i went on, the ranting never stopped. The story line is enjoyable. But the on and on and on and on and on rant-style of the bookgets a little old."
5,This book would not make a good movie. Really it wouldn't!!,Now that I have hopefully prevented various pretenders from ruining the Anabasis like the Iliad and other works have been ruined by the mass media let me say that this book has had a profound influence on my life. I don't understand why but Xenophon in particular reaches out across time to speak to me in a way that most other ancient authors do not. I can say nothing better about a book. His analyses are not always correct but they are always insightful. One of my favorite stories of all time.
5,One of Cinema's greatest scores from original recordings,"One of Alfred Newman's greatest Oscar wininig scores available for the first time in its entirety from the original tracks. While sonically this recording may not be up to today's standards, It is a joy to listen to as Newman recorded it. The sound is quiet good considering it was recorded 56 years ago. Avoid the terrible boot which was released last year and get this great Varese-Fox release. The classic soundtrack release of 1999!! Lets hope Varese-Fox can come up with more winners like BERNADETTE."
4,The Claasic Pirate,"Robert Newton portrayed the pirate Blackbeard better than all the other pirate actors in film history in my opinion. His performance of the notorious pirate, though 'Hollywoodized' with bits of humor, was delightfully entertaining."
3,Blackbeard The Pirate color 1952,Picture quality was excellent. DVD paused for a second or two at least 15 times throughout the movie. Great classic pirate movie!!
1,Do not waste you money,"We , my husband and I have a extremely busy schedule so we were looking to get more energy, we tried the product and it did nothing for us, it says that it will give you energy that......blaa,,,,. It did nothing.Please do not waste you money."
2,muted colors and looks faded,"I love this painting.Don't love this poster.Compared to Van Gogh's other posters that hang in my office, this one looks faded & old. Not sure if its just the poster itself - or if this painting really lacks the brilliant vibrant colors of its ""friends"".For the price - I'm not too upset - but one of those ""wish I had seen it in person"" before I purchased."
5,Rhone poster,I got the whole set of three. LOVE LOVE LOVE them. Once I had them mounted and framed and hung them I could NOT be more proud how they turned out.Colors are gorgeous and look great in my home.
4,Good,I liked the poster I was hoping the colors would be as vibrant as in the picture but easy come easy go. Shipped quickly arrived quickly.
2,Not the best print,"i love everything vincent van gogh, ordered all the other prints and love them. This one is not detailed like i would like, in a frame it doesnt have any definition, and i wouldnt receommend this one/."
1,Este CD es basura,"Sinceramente lo escuche por curiosidad y no me gusto NADA!No tiene flow es muy aburrido y mas de lo mismo, no hay inovacion.Og Black debe retirarse, ya es un cohete quemao'. Chezina no se como no se abochorna aparentando ser lo que no es y la cancion le aplica. ReTirAtE Pai! Lito & Master Joe deben analizar sus vidas y reconsiderar otro trabajo. Polaco, tiene talento pero no va para ningun lado en la tiraera.El productor del disco; muy ridiculo en sus portadas, se cree modelo de GQ,(mijo no vas para ningun lado con esas charrerias)."
1,Looks Great! ( but need some clips before buying),"This CD looks Great! The only problem I have with buying it is I've never heard of the Group or songs. If it sounds as good as it looks, I'll buy it.So how about ""a taste"" or send me a sample CD, & I'll gladly review it! Cowboy"
4,"Analysis/prescription: The heart of ""The Retirement Myth""","The historical analysis of the US development and its consequences for its population since the end of WWII is probably as well done in this work as any which has been published. However, it does not keep up that quality in its prescriptions for the future and leaves a huge opportunity for revision in the light of the consequences of the direction the actual situation has taken for the bulk of the American populace since that time."
3,"agree that it falls apart, but...","Yes it does fall apart, but easily snaps back together. When I travel with the toy, I put the little pieces in a zipploc bag and take them along. My daughter loves this toy so it is worth it."
2,I honestly feel kind of raped.,"I purchased this pencil holder because it offered a thermometer and in the photo it looked sturdy. When I received it I noticed it was all painted plastic. I took good care of this and all of a sudden after 3 months the buttons ceased to work and I could not set the time anymore.When I went to check what was going on, I noticed the batteries leaked and somehow damaged the device. When I inserted the batteries again (correct polarity) all digits on the screen went on and the device finally died. [...]"
1,Waste of Money,"The LCD display particially works! So, now I have a product that doesn't display the date. Total waste of money, very disappointed that companies have products that do not work as advertised."
4,Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long Term Fullfillment,This is very good information for learning both about oneself and about a particular skill.
1,Ex Pectations,The 5 Essential Keys to MasteryWhy...Will anybody spend Money on such book?Spend TIME!To read it...Spend Reflection...One valuable point I can relate to:The essence of your LifeMay depend onWhat kind of Teachers you had...A Teacher that develops you to your full potentialOr persons who accelerate your self destruction..The bigUnanswerable question:WHO am IIn that senseLeonard is of no help at all...You have to find out yourself...
4,Skeeter Davis' - The End of the World,What an amazing voice. It's like a stroll back in time hearing this music again!
3,Let Down??,"Was this CD box set a let down?? Well, for the price, no, indeed. I paid used @ about $22. so, for 4 discs, it is an excellent price (even for the new price)!NOw this set of Roger Corman flicks is notorious for being the worst films ever made. The only real one I was looking forward to is GAssssssss. I haver tried to find this film for years. It was basically a dated hippie romp. At least it could have been a little more serious, the setting was post-apocolyptic.Of the others, I really have seen (bits & pieces, wholly) Mama, trip, and X. the others are new to me. I am a fan of bad cinema (and 1970's nudity ) and this set doesn't let down the Tarintinoesque fan.As a package i have a HUGE beef. Why are the DVDs doublesided???!!!! Now you can protect the DVDs with much less certainty.And why is, on most DVDs with such WEAK SOUND!!! You have to max the volume on my TV , for even to even make out the dialogue!!!!!!! The cheap DVDs are super-loud. Y is that????!!!!"
5,Another great series by BBC,"When it comes to documentary series, BBC has always met and exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it. Watch it and you are going to put life in perspective."
3,MORE ENTERTAINING THAN EDUCATIONAL,THE ADS SEEMED LIKE THIS WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO BELIEVE THE HYPE. I SUSPECT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT LEAST PARTIALLY A COMPILATION OF SOME PREVIOUSLY SHOT FOOTAGE ON OTHER 'EXPEDITIONS'. WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY PROVIDED INSIGHT AS TO HOW THE VARIOUS HUMAN GROUPS INTERACTED WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENTS AND EACH OTHER. THIS WAS SORT OF JUST ONE SHOT SCENARIOS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SOME AREAS OR WITH ONE SUBGROUP IN THE AREA. NOT QUITE UP TO THE STANDARD 'PLANET EARTH' STUFF BUT STILL ENTERTAINING. CONTENT MORE LIKE AN OLD SCHOOL FILM STRIP IN SOCIAL STUDIES BUT WITH BETTER PHOTOGRAPHY.
5,awesome!,"awesome documentary on various cultures around the world. if you like planet earth and life, you'll definitely love this one!"
5,Great Documentary/terrible seller,"What I saw of this documentary was fantastic and I wish I could have viewed all 3 discs. The problem was that the DVD skipped terribly on the first 2 discs so I didn't bother to watch the 3rd disc. Very disappointing that it was so defective it made viewing pleasure slim to none. I had to rate the movie 5 stars, but I rate the seller, I-Deals no stars. I had a heck of a time going through the lengthy return process and email exchanges with the seller and once I put the product in the mail to send it back it took about 2 weeks to finally refund my money. I also had to contact Amazon for an A-Z refund just in case, but the seller did come through."

3,Confused on what I ordered...,"I thought I had ordered a Component to HDMI connection which this is definitly not. I'm sure it works well for PS3, but if you are trying to connect the way that I was, it will not work."
5,Does What You Want As Well As You Would Expect,"I bought this for my old PS2 after the Sony component cables I bought stopped working (my son kept coiling up the cable after using the PS2 - that obviously damaged the delicate wires inside the protective casing). The PS2's included composite cables are way too blurry to read small text well and the images/colors can bleed, so I highly prefer component cables for the best quality. This particular cable is even better than the old official Sony PS2 component cables as it feels much more sturdy. The inputs fit both of my TVs perfectly without any effort (the older PS2 version's cable were too tight and required twisting to remove from the TV) - they aren't too loose and they aren't too tight... Goldilocks would approve. The image is definitely crisp and the cord is quite long. All in all, I am pleased with the product and would highly recommend this to others."
1,Doesn't work?!,"Bought this to use my PS3 with an LCD 720p HD TV that does not have an HDMI input... I have my PS3 set up for HDMI in my bedroom, but want to use it with the non HDMI set too. Damn, still trying to get this to work, trying to reach Sony Customer Service for assistance. If it doesn't work, I'll return it"
5,Great Product!!!!,"i ordered the generic cable first, and it worked ok, but i ordered this one because i had the feeling it would be better, and it was! the picture is much better and these cables are actually Sony brand, so you know they're quality. They are also 24k gold plated and they really do work well. they are well worth the money!!! now if only the price would go down a bit on the Monster Xbox (not 360) component cables! LOL"
1,March birthday Present,My husband knew I wanted aquamarine earrings. He got them for me!!!! They are lovely. Exactly what he thought they would be and I think they are gorgeous.
2,Be careful... not compatible,"Perhaps you all already know this, but we had to learn the hard way, this train is not compatible with the wooden tracks. We went on a trip to get a new train (my son traded in his Halloween candy in exchange for this), bought this one and then when we got home found it will not work with our other trains or track. Big let down... ""Take along"" means not for regular track play. Make sure this is what you are looking for before buying, since it doesn't seem evident in the description."
3,two-and-a-half stars,"Gonna have to go with Flying Book Reader here: I agree, it's mostly a snoozer. A friend told me it picks up in the middle. I'm about a third of the way through and calling it quits, and not sorry after reading the rest of the reviews. I just don't have the passion for entering 12 parallel worlds.Regarding comparisons with HP, don't even go there. The similarity ends with wizardry. Period. I'm mad about HP; it does NOT follow you'll go for Chresto."
2,"Boring, mean, and not very well written","It was such an awful, illogical read that I had to give up half way through this book. And the part where one of the characters makes a face by pulling her eyes ""long and Chinese""? What's next, references to minstrel shows? Who edits this stuff?"
2,A Snozer,I couldn't get into it.The characters semed to flat or over drawn and I didn't really care for where the story was going at all.I stoped reading it after reading three chapters.
4,Nice ......... Very NIce !!!,"Purchased this for my Dell 17"" laptop. Threw away the inner bag for a 15"" and simply slide my 17"" into that compartment slot. Fits perfect and does NOT get scratched or banged. Well made product and lots of additional storage for papers, disks, power cord, mouse, etc. Once heavy laden with all your gear don't break your back tryin to carry it all, just pull out the handle and roll it from your car to the building and down the hall."
5,PATRIOT from Swiss Gear by Wenger Triple Gusset Rolling Computer Case w/ Removable Tote,I am extremely impressed with this computer case. It is attractive in appearance. It's very well made (I have had NO handle problems). The removable laptop tote is a real plus. I recommend it highly.
4,i love it!,"It provides an incredible amount of space. Great design, rolls well, handle comes up and down easily, very sturdy. It is a little deeper than other rolling suitcases, but it still travels well. Great for putting some clothes and law books for traveling over the weekend. I love the top small pocket for easy access to tissues, I.D., etc."
4,Great looking case!,"I love everything about this case except the last stage of the telescopic handle sometimes doesn't expand. After I returned the first one I got, I read reviews by others complaining about the same issue. Still, I liked the case enough to give it another shot. Although the handle on the replacement case still isn't perfect, it is much better. I just have to hold the latch down until the handle is completely extended.Only other criticism is I wish there were better pockets to store my flash cards, memory sticks, etc.All in all, I am quite happy w/ this case and would recommend it."
1,Don't Buy This Bag if You Travel Frequently,"This bag is sub-par for frequent travelers and Wenger doesn't stand by their product at all. In less than 2 years the first one I purchased broke in the handle and a wheel fell off. I bought a second one and after one year the whole handle apparatus not only snapped, it came out of the bag altogether. The first time this happened I contacted the manufactuer several times and they ignored me. I was forced to buy another one because I had to leave again and needed a bag and also was thinking it may have been just a flaw in that particular bag so I was going to give it another chance. After the second bag broke I knew this bag was poorly made. This bag should last for a very long time. I do travel 2-4 days a week and run through the airport a lot so in a nutshell this bag is poorly made for people like me. I do not recommend it if you travel a lot."
4,How can you hate thursday?,"yea, so i bought their other cds and i thought they were amazing. A lot of kids call thursday posers. How can they be a poser band? They pretty much pioneered this type of music. This album was revoltuionary to the whole New Jersey scence as well as the whole screamo/punk scene in general. This album actually shows screaming as a viable music form. this album was recorded raw-nothing fancy. if you like all the fancy studio stuff, chances are you are just another poser trying to be in the scene. this album is how music should be made:recorded-not produced. The only thing that needs work is Geoffs voice, which has improved on their other albums. To be honest I cant wait until thursday's next cd. If you hate thursday then you must hate music in general."
1,"Do Not Buy This Software, or Anything, From This Company!","Pinnacle's Studio is garbage! It is 90% spam and 10% video ""Capturer"". You can't even import movies from your hard drive to edit them! That is ridiculous! Updating is a nightmare. For instance, I just went to ""activate"" the product for update/upgrades and it says my serial number is invalid even though it was accepted during the installation. I tried to capture videos from my digital video camera and it crashes the computer just trying to open the folder these movies are in on the flash memory card. This is the third time I have installed this garbage and once I remove it this time the disks are going in the trash along with the ~$100 I spent for it. Never again, Pinnacle! I repeat, do not buy anything from Pinnacle or you'll regret it. Peace. BTW, as another member stated, this software is not even worth pirating or warezing."
2,Must have awesome computer for it to work right!,"I think this program would work great if I had a better computer. Please don't waste your time using this unless you have at least 2 gigs of RAM, a fast processor, and a decent video card. Otherwise, you are going to be very, very frustrated."
3,Pretty Good,"The best feature of this program is that you can actually work with individual frames. I record from my TiVo to my computer using this program. It allows me to totally clip out any commercials, it's pretty easy to do. The downside is that it does have a tendency to crash when you least expect it."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Was this book funny? Not in my opinion. It lacked relevancy to the ""contemporary"" student. However, if you were time warped back to 1952, and applied these suggestions, you MIGHT get a laugh.This book was a disappointment. Poorly organized, and not good as a quick reference. Seriously, content was ridiculous (and I don't mean funny)!In all fairness, maybe it just didn't meet my professional needs or mesh with my personal taste, but I highly suggest getting hold of copy and looking through it before purchasing it."
1,Disappointed with the taste,"I'm a little surprised at the 5 stars some have gave this product. The smell and taste isn't very palatable and no one in my family could finish it. I bought this product for my long term food storage program and would eat it in a food shortage scenario, but since I rotate my inventory out (we eat what we store) this product would go to waste. I have not tried the other Bear Creek soup mixes but would not buy this particular mix again."
1,Vegetable Beef soup-didn't like the flavor,"I am a huge fan of Beer Creek's Chicken Noodle Soup. The soup is delicious and I buy it by the case. I decided to try the Vegetable Beef. Bought a case and ended up not liking it at all. It just seems to have a horrible taste -no vegetable or beef flavor at all. So if you happen to try this one FIRST, don't use it as an example......it's just a matter of personal taste because the Chicken Noodle is a 10-star soup!!"
4,Sometimes a fresh look at some old controversies,"Davies ruffled feathers of academics especially with his perspective on the fate of Jews in Poland during WW II. Poles often are presumed guilty of ""not doing enough"" to help Jews escape the Nazis. Davies argues that Poles were also in need of help and not in any position to offer others much help. His argument conflicted with views generally held by Jewish intellectuals and others and he had claimed that their influence had him removed from a proposed teaching position at a university. In any case, the book should be read as a serious contribution to understanding Polish history, and not as a polemical threat to anybody's ""ironclad"" notions."
3,Not Just History,"But sociology and psychology as well. I have been trying to educate myself in the area of European History over the course of the last year or so. As an introduction, I bought ""Europe: A History"" by Davies. After that overview, I have acquired other titles that focus on specific topics on European history such as ""Heart of Europe: A Short History of Poland."" As a novice, I have no qualifications to challenge the history. I have a problem with the style. Mr. Davies, perhaps as someone who ""feels"" history, spends a great deal of effort addressing the sociological and psychological consequences of the various historical events. If Mr. Davies were to describe a car accident, he would include descriptions of how the passengers and by-standers felt and what it was that might have caused them to do what they did next. For me, I would rather have the facts reported as if they were a newspaper article. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for the factual information."
5,Great patterns,I really like the patterns included in this book. You can choose from simple pieced designs or beautiful appliqued border designs.
1,don't bother,"I was hoping to get an overview of Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations - this is not it. According to the introduction, Wittgenstein is considered very hard to understand and the author is going to prove that his writings were actually coherent. Then he takes us on a confused trip through the works. The author gives a zillion footnotes back into W's papers and quotes from them at length. I didn't feel there was a synthesis of W's work, more of a confused roadmap. If you're a Wittgenstein junkie then you might find this book useful. I felt like I was reading a grad student's research paper. If you're a student of philosophy looking to understand what Wittgenstein is all about, then this is not the book for you."
2,nastiest broc cheese soup ever,"I love all things cheese and broc cheese soup is a fav of mine, but this is the worst excuse for broccoli cheese soup I have ever tasted. At nearly $4 for a bag I am highly disappointed!"
2,Salt Cheddar Broccoli?,"Salt is the seventh and the twelfth ingredient. I paid over 5.00 for this bag, and I can't eat it because it's so salty. Cheddar cheese has salt in it, Blue cheese has salt in it, and then the MSG. This is poison in a bag."
5,Great tripod,This is the first quality tripod that I have owned so I don't have a lot to compare it to. It is very solid and functional. The velco strap at the bottom can be easily used to hang your camera bag adding a little weight and stability when needed. I would heartily recommend it.
3,"Decent Ride, Poor Landing","There is just too much to like about the McGee series to be very harsh on this installment. However, as a few others have noted, this is not one of the best, and is probably not suitable for anyone just getting into these generally excellent mystery novels. The premise is pretty interesting, and some of the characters along the way are well-drawn, but I found the plot a bit too reliant on pop-psych, with the ending very unsatisfying. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll leave it at that."
2,Noooo!!!!!!!,"it demonstrates the end of my respect or hope for Tim Armstrong.His carrier sort of went like this...Operation Ivy ( Energy ) godlike album, earns my respect for many years to come.Rancid (Rancid) It was a huge dissapointment, but for his sake I decided to give this band another chance.Rancid (Indestructible) it was very destructible, I thought I might never listen to Rancid again after this garbage album.Rancid (Let's go!) It was ok, again, I ddn;t really like it so much.Rancid (Life Won;t Wait) Thank god, this album renewed my dying repsect in my favorite musician ever, it is a great album.Transplants (Transplants) As soon as I got to track 4, i knew that there was no hope and hanging my head took the cd out of my stereo, there where a couple moments there, I just sat there, thinking, Tim, How could you man? why did you?"
1,Tim Armstrong = Sellout,Enough said about what I described. It seems Tim's crybaby liberal image has turned him more into the plankton he once evolved from. Avoid buying at all cost. Check out Life Won't Wait the last masterpiece Tim made before he went home crying to mamma.
4,Mix of rap and punk...,"With one part pop for good measure. I think the stand-out tracks here are ""Romper Stomper,"" (great movie also,) ""Dj Dj,"" and ""Down in Oakland."" I loved ""Diamonds and Guns"" before I heard it on a womans' conditioner commercial. Come on Tim. It just put me off I guess...I still blast the cd a lot in el trucko but I can't get down with the bizarre tracks like ""Quick Death"" and ""D.R.E.A.M.,"" the latter of which must be a joke."
2,Ti mArmstrong should just get it over with...,"and start a Clash cover band. Seriously, he hasn't made an original piece of music since Operation Ivy. This sad attempt at making something ""creative"" is purely empty. The one catchy song, Diamonds and Guns, sounds like a combination between Clash and the Gorillaz, two bands with more creativity in their toes than Armstrong could ever muster. If you like the sound of this, I would definitely recommend ""Sandinista"" by the Clash, and Gorillaz self-titled album. WAY better. And if you like the punk-ska, check out Operation Ivy."
3,Priced too high for the teny-tiny sized engine. Where is the caboos?,"My nephew liked the toy, but it was just a bit too small. I did not relize how small it would be until I recv'd. Maybe to make up for the size offer the caboos too. Anyway the bigger toys got the real spotlight for Christmas. Thanks that it is durable, but aa bit high priced for a tiny sized toy. Not a real bang for the buck."
2,Less than impressed,"Very lightweight (read as: feels cheap). Cutting angle isn't comfortable. Maybe it will take some getting used to, but I don't think I will give it the chance. I would not reccommend this product. Spend a few bucks more on something better."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This movie was an unrealistic portrayal of the Tate La Bianca murders that occured in August, 1969. If you want the real version buy the 1976 Helter Skelter if you can find it. It is obsolete.Don't waste your time or money watching this movie. The guy who portrays Manson has a booming voice and Charles Mansion did not. ""I am God, I am Satan, I am you, and you are me.""A lot of the film is too dark to see and the photography is very poor. The script is hard to follow and the acting is subpar. Folks, don't waste your time on this version of Helter Skelter."
1,People looking for the REAL Movie THIS ISN'T IT!!!,My husband bought this for me when I finished reading the book. He thought it was the movie I had seen bits and pieces of in the early 70's. Well...it isn't! I was terribly disappointed in the incomprehensible crap that's on this video. It was a complete waste of time & money!! I wish that the documentary with Vincent Bugliosi wasn't out of print in the U.S. this one should be out of print!
1,"This is NOT the courtroom drama ""Helter Skelter""","This is a crappy, low budget flick that seems to show nothing more than hippies dancing around for 2 hours. Very boring, a real waste of money"
1,Helter Skelter Murders,I was very disappointed in this version of Helter Skelter.I would not reccomend buying this particular video.BORING!!
5,Wonderful!,This is the _cutest_ book! Makes a great gift. It's amazing how author coordinated the pictures and the words to create a poignant message with humor and lightheartedness.
3,Okay but not great,"I think some of the photos in this are really cute, but most of the accompanying text was just a little too childish for me. I have found many more profound thoughts to cheer me up and help me build real happiness in ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
5,Magnificent!,"This little book is witty, original, and impactfully put together. The juxtaposition of great photographs and a deceptively simple commentary gives rise to a true masterpiece. Our kids loved as much as we did! Can't wait for the next installment!"

1,Not widescreen.,"Despite the specs on the back of the package stating both films are in 16x9 widescreen, they ARE NOT. This is a repackage of the 2006 double feature DVD. It is the EXACT SAME DVD with fullscreen transfers only. This makes New Line's DVD art department scumbag liars... or just incompetent. Right?"
1,Don't buy,I have to agree with the reviwer above. It's a ripoff. They claim that it's in widescreeen but it's not.
1,No special features...,"Like the other reviews here have stated, the back of this DVD packaging erroneously lists that both films are presented in anamorphic widescreen, which is not the case. This is simply two films crammed on a single-sided DVD with Fullscreen transfers on both. Even worst, this release lists special features including director's commentary, additional scenes, storyboards, etc. None of that is included on this disc. In my opinion, this constitutes fraud on the part of New Line/Warner Bros. What is truly puzzling is why they went to the trouble of repackaging this Double Feature when the first release actually had the correct specs on the back. I'd like a refund!"
5,Great,"I wanted to get a top brand, since I had read other reviews of other brands. I found the best price through Amazon and this card is plenty of space!"
3,"Good, but not Great","The plastic clip is sort cheap in quality and the buttons are a little difficult to operate. (Turning it off is difficult) BUT.. all that said, I like the sound quality and size and looks of the MP3 player. Overall, I'm pleased with mine."
