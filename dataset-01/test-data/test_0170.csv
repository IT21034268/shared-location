1,Don't Be Fooled,"This sound machine is not loud enough for one.Each time you turn it on, it is back at lowest level, so you have to push the button several times before it is back at the level you had previously. No way to tell what volume level you are at anyway.Has a silly ""demo mode"" button on back that is too easy to push on and sound only plays for a handful of seconds. Imagine doing all of this with a newborn baby in your arms."
5,A must-have gadget for New Parents,"My wife and I bought the DEX Products Sound Sleeper sound machine when we read inHealthy Sleep Habits, Happy Childthat this would help our new born sleep through the night. We have been using it for the last 6 months and we are very satisfied with its performance.It has several sound options, but we primarily use the ""Rain"" sound at maximum volume with the sound machine sitting on the floor next to our daughter's crib. This drowns out the small sounds that might wake her, while not activating our our voice activated baby monitor that sits waist high next to her crib.This sound machine also has a sleep timer, but we never use it.If you have a baby, you should really consider purchasing this sound machine."
4,Good product!,"I really like this product, my only complaint is I wish it was louder. Other then that I use it on my 12 week old son, who LOVES the sound of white noise. This machine doesn't actually play ""white noise"" but he uses it on the ""wind"" setting. He sleeps better then ever! For 20 bucks its the best around! If you have the money though, use this White Noise Machine Sleep Mate Sound Screen Dual Speed Sound Conditioner Marpac 980-A Latest Modelits better!!"
1,"Good features, poor construction","Unit has a good selection of features, but the logic on my unit failed within a week, and could not be resurected (no cause I can guess at either). And the way the unit is built, it cannot (or would be very hard) to take apart to poke at the guts and check for anything loose. So it gets a ""1""."
4,Sleep like a baby,"Love this sound sleeper. Nice to have the combination sounds you can program. Easy to use, and the sound is great. Take it on trips and use it at home also. I have no baby to use it for, but I sure sleep like one now that I have this."
5,Always loved it....,"I had it for my daughter who is now 3 and has always been a good sleeper for naps and bedtime...and still is. She was colicky in the early months and I feel this is one thing that soothed her and helped her to become a great sleeper. I am now using it for my newborn twins. LOVE IT. I also traveled with it.... I am happy with the volume, as I did not want her to rely soley on the sound and did not want it it too loud, as I weaned her into sleeping without it."
5,Great sound machine for anyone,"I have heard many types of sound spa's and sound machines and this one for the money, is great. You can pay hundreds of dollars for top notch ones, but really this one is just as good. I love it as much as my daughter does. We have used it daily for over a year now. The sounds are natural and it's been a very reliable product. And as for the heart beat sound that one person wrote about, silly thing to focus on, we never used it, as to me sounds annoying and creepy, but that would be up to you to decide. But do use it for the all the nature sounds and always wonderful ocean surf sounds. And in fact I'm going to buy one for my aunt who has trouble sleeping, this machine can work for any age."
1,Lacks Volume,"Having previously purchased a sound maker (which is no longer sold) for our 2 1/2 year old son, I was eager to purchase a similar sound machine for our newborn. I am very disappointed in this product. While it has many sound choices and options, it is barly loud enough to be heard across the room. I would suggest another product. The sound volume is the entire reason I use the product...to keep the little darlings sleeping even when the doorbell rings!!!"
2,Not loud enough and not soothing,"I was very disappointed with this sound machine and ended up exchanging it for the Marpac sound conditioner for my infant's room and my toddler's room in order to drown out each other's nightly disturbances. The DEX does have a lot of selections, but my husband and I thought only 3 of them were soothing--the white noise, the ocean and the wind. But the volume of the ocean sound was not constant and we thought it might actually wake our baby instead of drowning out household noises. The sound of the gulls, thunderstorm and some of the others were just plain annoying, not soothing at all. We tried combining some of the sounds, as it suggests, but it would just switch turns with two different sounds rather than playing them both simultaneously. Also, it's not loud enough and this is ultimately why we returned it. We are very satisfied with the Marpac, which sounds like a mixture between white noise and a fan blowing."
1,Not loud enough,"I purchased this item and was very disappointed in the volume control. Turned up to the highest possible volume, it was way too soft. Even having it placed right next to my head on the pillow, it was not loud enough. I returned it."
2,No White Noise Button! Not Loud Enough! Sucks Batteries,"This machine does not go loud enough and sucks batteries. Also, this machine does not have a white noise button, and it was advertised as having white noise. We bought this one and a Homedics soundspa because we know some babies like different sounds and we know that different machines make different sounds. Our little one prefers the white noise sound and the Homedics SoundSpa. This machine does have a wind noise that sounds similar, so we took it to the babysitter's and we let her use it there since he's not there often. Don't waste your money - get the Homedics SoundSpa. Its a little more expensive, but worth it in the end."
4,great product for the price,"I ordered this for my husband, he was having a hard time sleeping. The first few nights it was great but after awhile you can tell when the sound loops. If you pick up on that sort of thing, don't order this. But if you don't care about the repetition it's a great product for the price!"
2,sound sleeper not so great,"I bought the sound sleeper because I had been running a humidifier in my girls' room for 3 months so that they would not wake eachother up at night, and also so that my baby could nap in a noisy house without being disturbed. I wanted to replace the humidifier with a noise machine, but did not want to pay an arm and a leg for it. The Sound Sleeper did have a decent variety of sounds, although not the white noise I was hoping for. Using the wind setting that my older daughter said was the only one she liked, I was hoping would give ample background noise for the room. The Sound Sleeper could be turned loud enough but at the maximum volume (which I found necessary), the noise distorted to an extend that I found it extremely distracting just to be able to hear it through my baby monitor. My baby did not sleep well the night that I used it and the next day I went back to the humidifier. The only reason I did not return it was, frankly, laziness. That was my experience."
2,you get what you pay for,"I just bought this today for myself and tried to take a nap with it. The volume was fine on mine but the most soothing sound for me (the rain), was obviously recorded using a water pump. There are a lot little annoying sounds that kept waking me up. It might be somewhat relaxing for settling down but not staying asleep since extra ""random"" sounds come in every couple of seconds with each option."
3,Ok sound machine,This sound machine is ok in a pinch but there are better ones out there. For the money the graco is much better. If you are willing to spend the money go for the marpac. The sound quality on this machine is not that loud so it doesn't really block out ambient noises. We bought this for our baby but upgraded to the marpac instead. There are a lot of sound options but all we really wanted was white noise. The waves is probably the closest. The other sounds are a bit distracting. It's also a bit big and bulky and not great for traveling.
2,Sounds are awful,"We bought this to replace the other faulty sound machine we had for our daughter. I was excited to get it and was so disappointed when I turned it on. Other reviewers mentioned this but the volume is awful. It is very low at it's loudest. The other issue is the sound quality. My daughter sleeps with the ""rain"" noise and this rain sound sounds canned and almost like static. It's awful. The only redeeming quality is that the design is nice. However, design or not, it's not really functional. I am returning this asap. So disappointed."
2,Horrible sound effects,I was really excited when I found this. But I was very disappointed when I actually plugged it in. The sound effects sound like you are in a tunnel. Cheap and unrealistic!
1,save your money,This piece of junk burned up on the second use!!This is a dangerous item to leave plugged in a baby's room.Should pull them off the market.
1,"Don't Buy It for ""Rain""","If like me you enjoy the ""rain"" sound, don't buy this one. It is a distractingly short loop; bad sound quality. Also arrived broken - volume control would not work."
5,Outstanding Piece of Machinery @ very low cost...,"I bought this product for my goddaughter who was having a tough time adjusting to sleeping in her crib. As soon as we laid her down in the crib, and set the unit to the womb sound... I believe that in a matter of 3 minutes, she was down for the count! = )I use this machine to lay her down with when I sit for my girlfriend, and never have a fear of any amount of fussing from my goddaughter which of course is less stress on her and on me!Great machine to have for all young children!"
5,Love it,I had an older model that did not have the womb sound but I love this machine so much that I'm replacing my older unit. I'm not a child but the soothing sounds help me to drift off comfortably. Music is sometimes louder than needed or had erratic high pitches that will yank me out of a dream but this machine helps drown out the noises of neighbors and cars so I can have a restful sleep.
3,good product,I try this cream 3 days ego its fill nice in face let me use for longer time its good cream for this price
3,more of a treatment than a moisturizer...,"This product is very thick, yet not greasy. You do have to apply it generously, it is hard to smooth evenly unless you use a decent amount of product. Definetly more of a treatment than a moisturizer. Doesn't moisturize all that great and it doesn't give you that nice clean moisturized feeling after application. It does have great ingredients however I am not very impressed and expected more.derma e Peptides Plus Double-Action Wrinkle Reverse Crème, 2 oz (56 g)"
3,Good for price,"Good price,smells nice moisturiser ok.If you have nice skin without sun damage this is a good product for you.If your over 40 and your skin is not perfect I would not waste my money."
2,UT lovers=sega genesis lovers=pepsi lovers,"sigh..lets get some things straight..any game variation that UT so proudly boasts exists as a quake 3 mod..if its worth playing in the first place..UT's graphics are NOT better than quake 3's both admittedly from reviewers(even those who prefer UT) and also because of the fact that they lack geometric curves which is a necessary aspect for newer 3d realism..also, what's up with the pathetic internet code? and why does it require a beta direct x file to handle the geforce card? notice the low polygon count on the models? why do the space graphics look like huge 2 dimensional BMP files? happy UT owners are most likely just bad quake players *happy fragging*"
2,no stradegy involved,I saw all the good reviews for this game so i got it. Well in the game the players and bots just run and shoot everywhere you don't aim well and just move too fast and choppy to actually have a good stradegy for this game.
5,An unforgettable classic,"Unreal Tournament. The first, the best, the unforgettable.This game started the franchise and even now, after 5 years, it still retains it's original flavor.Great fun, great action, innovative gameplay.Even if you own newer titles I would still purchase this one, simply for the experience."
4,"great game, but not for Windows NT","I think this is great, maybe the greatest game i've ever played, but on my operating system (windows NT) I can't get it to run on full screen, only a 4x6 inch window. I've tried everything, even changing some .INI files but it still won't work! My dad is a programmer and he can't get it to work in full! when u make the window larger, the resolution goes higher, and it doesn't run on my comp cuz its only a 333MHz Pentium II. If you want a game that is easier to operate and start, stick with half life or counterstrike. Maybe the patch i downloaded was bugged or it didn't work right, I'm not sure. The AI is excellent and the internet play rocks. hopefully i will get it to run :) -good luck :)"
2,THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!,"I really am at a lost as to what happen when Julia London wrote this book it is simply horrible and not like her at all!! I have read 7 of her other books which I loved and couldn't put them done but The Ruthless Charmer, just doesn't cut it. I am shocked as I don't know what could have happen!!!"
2,I have to rate this one low,Why was it called the ruthless charmer. I simply do not get it. Julian (hero) was not ruthless. As a matter of fact he was a very fine and sweet character. The ruthless one was Lady Claudia (heroine). I did not like her. She was arrogant and she caused a lot of grief to his family. It was hard to belive that he could possibly be in love with her. There was nothing likable about her. The plot focused to much on the sister of the hero. I got confused as to who this story was really about. Could have been better.
2,Disappointing,"the first half of the book is still ok......... But after the somewhere in the middle where they finally got married it start to get real boring. No offense to London's fans. But this is my first and last London's book Though i admit the part where she finally save julian's sister is heroic but ..........i have to say not v well developed. The story juz keeps go on and on........ abt ""i love him/her but i cant let him/her know else she will make me weak"""
3,My Opinion,"This is the first book I have read by Julia London, for a new writer she is pretty good. Usually I read Deveraux, Lindsey, Kane, Quick and Putney for Historical Romances. This book started out very slow for what I'm use to, but it did get much better. I have to say it was nice to read a book that the characters knew they loved the other almost from the beginning. I wouldn't say this was a hard to put down book, but it is one you will want to finish."
3,Good for younger children,"This book had been recommended to me for my 14 year-old-son, who seems to get down often. I found this book to be geared towards a younger person that a teen, but it was a good conversation starter for us. The book was received in great condition and in a timely manner."
4,Getting Started the Easy Way,Basic Essentials is just that--the basics. It's a nice book to get started. You can easily go out and naviagate after reading this book and practicing with your map and compass. I used this book as a reference in teaching Boy Scouts how to navigate in the wilderness. I was disappointed it didn't have more about the sport of Orienteering.
5,so super funny n' fabulous!!!!!!!,"Glam parties, gorgeous boys, super cool celebrities... what more could a girl want? But because it's all told from Octavia's view point you can really understand how weird and scary living in such world must be. As well as being v. v. funny, it gets you totally involved in the plot. I really hope there's going to be a sequel or even a series!?!"
5,Nicely done,"The instructor delivers on his promise. The steps are easy to learn and the instruction is easy to follow. The progression is quick and, once again, easy. Image quality is excellent and various camera angles are very helpful. Overall, a must have volume for beginners or even teachers (why not copy something that works so well?). Nicely done."
4,The Tango Fundamentals - Volume 3: Basic Giros,"I have purchased 3 different argentine tango teaching dvd's. This is by far the best I have seen, it's clear and has enough repetition that you can learn from it. You feel you are in an argentine dance studio, adding the very distinct flavor of this tango. I recommend this teacher the most out of all of them. He is anrelaxed and experienced teacher."
1,I didn't enjoy it,I took a chance and paid .99 for the CD. There is a reason why it was being sold so cheaply.
2,"Good Graphics, bad everything else.","Play the demo before you do anything you'll regret-- such as buying this garbage game.Great to look at, but if cars really drove anything like in DiRt... anywhere within 50 feet of a road would be unsafe.Also, this game doesn't make use of the mouse, which is disrespectful to PC gamers and flat out annoying; you don't have the option to enable it.(If anyone's interested in the performance, I get an awesome frame rate with everything maxed, a 1280 x 1024 resolution, while running on an 8800ts. The beautiful graphics make me long for a good racing game, which this is anything but. )Edit: Playing with a keyboard is next impossible, and I find the game barely even has the keyboard in mind; it's vastly improved, but still not that great, when played with a 360 controller."
3,A racing game with photo realistic graphics and some fun gameplay.,"First of all let me show you my specs to give you an idea of what you will need to run this game at ultra settings.Dual core 3.4Ghz cpu,3GB Ram,Asus 8800gts 640MB Video card,Dvd rom drive,.With these specs i am able to run this game at ultra high settings and do not have a bit of slow down while playing it.As for the gameplay it is pretty standard fair,you compete in a bunch of different races and try to beat the other cars to the finish and get the best time,thats it.This being said any racing fan will love this game because it handles well,even with the keyboard controls.As for the online part of this game you try to get the best time while doing laps around the tracks and then your score is posted among hundreds of other drivers.Other than the amazing graphics this game will not blow you away with anything new but you will have a good time playing it."
2,Below Average Read,"In this fantasy adventure quest, the orphan hero, Rokey, was raised in a monastery. After an accident occurs, Rokey leaves his home and explores Firma. He is almost robbed when a elf named Flaskamber saves him.Rokey joins the Elf's group of friends led by Stanford. There is also Fia the bard and Lorq the giant. Soon they are attacked by ratmen, who are after Rokey. Why would they be after this orphan?The Orphan's Quest is your typical fantasy with all the clichés that go with it. The only thing that stands out is that the main hero, Rokey, is gay, and there is a romance between him and Flaskamber. I'm sure that fantasy fans will like this novel, but it really didn't interest me. Many of the questions that rises in the book are unanswered by the disappointing ending."
4,A fun game,"At only 10 bucks, it's more than worth the price of admission. I've only had the game a few weeks, but it's provided hours of fun. There are a lot more difficulty levels I haven't even touched yet, so I'll be enjoying this for a long time to come."
4,CLASSIC BURT REYNOLDS FILM FORGET THE REMAKE!,This a classic football movie. Forget the remake this is the real deal! The DVD has a great transfer and some cool extras.
5,Even better than the original...,"This album is worth the price just for the first song, Moten Swing. What a great collection of swing/blues riffing and melodic solo flights! Ellis and Robillard must've had a great time cutting this album, because the joy and sincere love of the genre come though in every phrase. How can you play swing licks for an entire album without repeating yourself or wearing out your welcome? I don't know, but these two masters do it with ease. I've had this album and its predecessor, Conversations in Swing Guitar, at my office and in my car for months now, and still spin them over and over. You focus on savoring the music, or just use it as background... that's one of the great things about this type of instrumental music."
5,"Great FPS add a zest of Jordan, mix thoroughly, enjoy.","Great game on its own merit, i did enjoy some of the personifications of the characters from Jordan's novels, though some seemed a bit ""blah"". The multiplayer part of the game is truly awesome."
5,An incredible game!!,"I am apalled at some of the negative reviews on this game. It combines spectacular graphics(It was built on the Unreal engine, so what else would you expect?) and a totally engrossing storyline. If you have a good top end graphics card that supports Direct 3d, then you are in for a spectacular journey in this game. The direct 3D mode of this game is absolutely breathtaking especially in certain levels. I have experienced no sluggishness at all with my Riva Tnt 2 Pro video card(a top end video card that is excellent). However those who choose to use the low end cards like the entire Voodoo series(the yugos of computer video cards), will not enjoy this or any other game because of all the sluggishness those cards produce frequently. I fully recommend this game to anyone who like me has waited for a a perfect blend of Role playing and fps games. The playabilty of this game is wonderful and it is a fun, challenging game as well. Enjoy!"
5,good book. totally relevant material.,had no problems passing the exam easily. though i was pretty skeptical when i first started reading the book...
2,Disappointing,"The book was pedantry and din't answers any questions I had when I bought it. I thought it would give more information about the spirit, but it was not helpful at all."
5,"Draws you in, then slams the door on your fingers!","Nancy in Tacoma, WA : Very enticing characters in a victorian like tale of religious prudery, moral rigidity and sordid sex. All topped off with powers that exist beyond death. I liked this book, you will as well."
1,Just awful,"Let me first say that I'm a big fan of re-arranging songs in different genres... and I would think that Beck's songs are pretty good vehicles for such a tribute. But I can't believe how bad this is!The band obviously has some reasonable players in it, but they just seem to miss the point, mostly playing boring retreads of the originals, seemingly trying to avoid any elements of bluegrass! It doesn't help that there are no vocals, and absolutely no arrangement to speak of - the songs are all extended by way of tedious solos (often by the scratchy and harmonically-challenged violinist).The pick of the bunch (i.e. best, not worst) is probably Sexx Laws, which retains the funkiness of the original but at least doesn't shy completely away from bluegrass stylings. There's some ok solos, mercifully short, and it just has a nice vibe to it (despite some obvious mistakes).All in all, a good idea but not thought out nearly enough."
4,the Dreams of Ada,I read this story from three different authors. It is a sad but true story. Worth your time to read.
1,I just don't know...,"This book was reviewed so much in Grisham's new book that I thought maybe I was missing something. So I purchased this book. I have gotten about 60 pages into it and I just can't make myself to keep reading. It just bores me to tears.It reads like a book, a documentary, etc. It's just that I can't seem to get to the ""meat"" of this story.I sent the book to a friend of mine, who is on death row and who is NOT guilty. He read it the first day and its now been passed on to 2 others on death row (and aren't guilty either). They seem to have enjoyed it. Maybe because they can identify more closely than we can?I just can't in good conscience recommend this book.If I ever make it all the way through it & find I could recommend it, I'll be back to edit. But for now, I can't recommend it."
1,Remembering Denice,"Denice and I grew up in the same small town in Oklahoma. It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell, OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out an old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman whose life was ended in the twinkling of an eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice."
4,Beautiful and inspiring,It is worthwhile watching it. It reminds us of what happened during wwII and the Soviet Union's oppression in Poland. Even if you are not Catholic you really appreciate the life of Karol Wojtyla and what a remarkable life he had.
1,Fun if you're just looking to be a better lay,"While some of these techniques and tips are useful or at least a little entertaining, this book doesn't have much to offer to women looking for a better understanding of straight men's experience of sex. Most unfortunately, it reinforces all kinds of stupid stereotypes of straight men as sex maniacs (they're apparently ""always in the mood"") and shameful attitudes about women's bodies (don't tell him about your period! god forbid you'd ask him to be mature enough to deal with the realities of your body and its needs! ew!). If you're looking for real advice on how to be a better, more understanding partner to a straight man, look elsewhere. Or at least take this with a MAJOR grain of salt."
2,Meh,Saw this book mentioned as a marriage saver in a silly movie and was intrigued. Not really what I was expecting.
3,"Could have been a great book, but...","Could be an awesome book, good information and written well but I have to put the book down every time the authors suggest using intimacy to obtain gifts. And they do this often.Very demeaning."
3,Great content but so many typos!,"This book is completely great. However, the kindle edition gad so many typos that reading it was sometimes like putting together a puzzle. They need to re-do the kindle edition.....seriously."
3,humorous but nothing new,maybe i've been around the block already. a little campy. but nothing really useful. 6 more words required? what ?
3,Nickelback Pickin' On CD not the best tribute,"This Pickin' On CD has vocals on it, which was odd, since no other ""pickin' on"" tribute I heard has that (and I've heard several- I like the idea of ""pickin' on""), and a lot of the arrangements don't do justice to the songs. The kitsch factor ranks high on this, however, so if you want something not many other Nickelback fans have, this is it."
2,Works well but breaks often,"I've had my roomba for 7 months and while it cleans my hardwood and tile floors great when it's working properly, it has broken repeatedly. Customer Service is now in the process of sending me my 4th unit. I have been very careful in my use of this product since I obviously know it's fragile, and yet it still continues to break. I have actually been told by customer service that it is only intended to be used once or twice a week and it is not intended to replace an upright vacuum. I would not recommend this product for anyone who intends on using it reguarly."
2,Good for hardwood floors,"This is not the solution I'd hoped for. Works OK on hard wood floors, but not on carpets. Big hassle to robot proof the area to be cleaned. Short charge means it can take days to clean your house. Wouldn't buy again."
5,And to think I thought my carpet was SOMEWHAT clean,"My grandmother gave my fiancee and I a Roomba for a wedding present. We have two dogs, both labs, so we have a decent problem with dog haif (especially since one is black). We used it the first day and I can not BELIEVE the amount of hair it picked up. I need to get a quick charger though, 12 hours is WAY too long to wait. All in all, I am recommending the Roomba to everyone I know."
3,Like it but...,"Could use a battery that wasn't racking up a memory, i.e. LITHIUM ION. 99% of people don't know not to drain nickel batteries before charging because of that. My grandmother got ahold of it and it now cannot seem to go longer than about 10-15 minutes at a time. If you get it, don't leave it on the charger all the time, drain it COMPLETELY before putting it back on the charger again.On a lighter note, I tend to rotate it to a new room on a daily basis, it keeps down on the maintenance with my involvement. I only wish the dirt compartment didn't have to be emptied quite so often. Tho if you use it very frequently, you don't tend to notice as much."
3,Works Good but die's younge,"Great on hardwood floors, but tire tread broke and replacement did not work, and then battery died. Life span of unit about 8 months. Construction is cheap, and the maintenance of the unit was not considered in the design."
2,It's only a toy,"I really hate cleaning floors. I really wanted to like the Roomba. I had fun with it for awhile, but it really is a toy. The Roomba just can't keep up with pets, hair, dust - two dogs, two cats, a bunch of birds + spinning wool and everybody has long hair. I never got the invisible wall to work. 12 hours to recharge is just silly. And a full charge was not enought to clean a 15 x 20 ft room. I just got a Dyson Animal. This is a real vacuum. And I think he's working on a robot."
1,Reject this Robot,"Within 90 days of purchase, the ac/dc adapter has been replaced, the battery has been replaced, a rapid charger added, and the unit still doesn't work. It holds a charge for about 15 minutes, and stops repeatedly during that time requiring re-setting. This company needs to do a lot of work to improve their product."
1,DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON!,Paid for product and never recieved item. Amazon refuses to accept liability and refund my money!
5,Green Acres,"My husband had been wanting this series for a long time, and he just loves it. Thank you Amazon."
5,A true comedy - Awesome!,"Green Acres is one of the funniest shows that has ever been shown on Television, and with the antics of Arnold the pig, it's 100 times funnier."
1,Terribly poor quality,"I hope I ordered my whole set of Green Acres from another company. It was a bootlegged copy and it is illegal to do that, isn't it? I sent it back and hopefully will get the monetary amount put back on my credit card....I think I ordered it from Alibris.....I loved the show but it was so messed up you could tell when there was a storm, the satellite went blooey so someone had to have taped it off TV Land , because it said TV LAND on the bottom right of the picture screen. ...... Mary"
3,No different than the first season,"Eva Gabor and the late Eddie Albert continue pleasing their fans in this second season of Green Acres. Sadly,Albert passed away not too long ago(he was born in the 1900's). Fans of GA are also fans of other Paul Henning creations and productions,The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction."
1,How can anybody be so idiotic,"If you watch the stupidness of the charachters on the screen, your brain will wither away, and pretty soon you will be just as stupid as these screwballs. This is not comedy, just some random people standing around, Oliver whatshisname the one with the slightest bit of intelligense, bitching around about the stupidity of his wife. I agree with him, just because someone is sexy doesn't mean they'd be any good for more that a night.Seacrest Out."
3,Kind of dissapointing,"This third album from Godsmack entitled FACELESS is a good rock thrill ride, but lacks anything original. Godsmack is simply re-hashing what they did in the first two albums, and putting it on this one. But it is still a good kick in the balls!"
5,smack THIS!,"godsmack ROX. their CD ROX. I waited for the countdown @ midnite for their new album 2b released... & it was SO worth it! the best track is of course ""I stand alone,"" but the other songs kick too. now that they got a new drummer aboard, the sound is definitely more defined than b4. this is their best album yet. if u don't know godsmack, u gotta get this album cause Sully's (lead) voice is out the window.long live GODSMACK!"
1,Bad...Just Bad...,"I was very upset with the album. When their first album came out it was ok. Awake was ok too. But the band is not as good as they used to be to me. The only way i could tell the difference in the songs was when the face of my radio indicated it was on the next track. I may be somewhat of a fan but am NOT tone def. If your looking for good metal and your in the Cleveland area I HIGHLY recommend 13 FACES these guys are F*****g awesome. Don't buy this album it's not worth the money but I must say this the fact that people say this band is no good because they are a AIC rip-off is getting tired itself, find something else wrong with the band would ya because the reviews will start to sound like Godsmacks music THE SAME!"
2,same sh^t,This band never changes it just keep makeing the same album over and over.Keeps sounding more like Alice In Chains but with out skill. Do some thing else you F^cking sell outs. If you own the first Godsmack album then dont buy any of the other ones Its a waste of time and money to buy any other Godsmack album. Buy Alice In Chains the band Godsmack took their sound from only with out the nu-metal bull sh^t.
1,Alice in chains rip-off,"I know it has been said on here many times before, this band is a complete AIC rip-off. If you don't beleive me, this cover looks very alike to the AIC album ""Facelift."" The guy from this band said that he did indead take his band's name from a track on ""Dirt."" Sully Erna even tries to look like Layne Staley. The sun logo first appeared on ""Dirt."" And it even so happens that they haven't participated on any Jerry Cantrell disc. This band sucks, Their firt album was tolerable, but then, when Layne Staley died and their secret was exposed. And that's all true because I have a habit of researching bands, and being AIC is my favorite group, I know plenty about them. Get ""Dirt"" for a better an origanal sound."
1,BORING,"this cd has no life to it, sure it may be hard but teh riffs are boring as hell and watty420 has never done a quality review to save his life."
3,Not as good as the rest,"I loved the first two albums, but this cd didn't quite do it for me. I didn't like how Sully let his voice get higher pitched in all of the songs. His whole sound is different, and I believe it throws off the old ""hardcore"" rock they used to have. However, the instrumental melodies are great, they are just as good if not better than the past albums. Also, if you don't believe me about how the voice has changed, listen to ""I Stand Alone"" then listen to another song on the album, You'll see the difference."
4,Can't expect much more,"Godsmack's initial release will always be the best, but Faceless is definitely better than their second CD, Awake. Personal favorites are Releasing the Demons and Make Me Believe."
3,"Same old, same old.","Sure it's good, but so was their other two cds. And surprise, surprise...it sounds just like them. The only problem with Godsmack is every song (other than the occasional masterpiece such as :""Serenity"" and the opening to ""I Am"") sounds the same. Lyrically AND musically the whole cd is a monotonous journey into what they already have done. Though, if you love the way Godsmack sounds and can't get enough of them, you really can't go wrong with this cd."
5,Essential reference for Harmony Kingdom collectors!,"The second edition of the Harmony Kingdom reference guide provides even more fascinating background on the company than the first, and provides even more useful data on the collection.If you're an HK collector, this second edition is indispensible. If you're not one, reading this book will make you one.There was a large group of retirements immediately before the publication of the first edition, so the second edition provides production figures for thirty pieces whose true rarity may be a surprise to HK collectors.The background information in the first volume is not completely repeated, which prevents the first edition from becoming truly obsolete."
5,Required reading for any HK collector!,"Anyone who collects Harmony Kingdom will find this book interesting and extremely helpful. The author provides a wealth of information on the company and the artists, an explanation of how the boxes are made, and a listing for each piece. The listing for each piece includes a picture, a description, information on variations, and the secrets to be found on the piece. A really handy book to have with you when you go out hunting for HK!Even if you have the first edition of this book, I think you will want this edition too. It includes all the pieces released through 1999 and more background information on the artists and the company than appeared in the first edition."
3,Good Product but I did not need it...,The foil frame on my ES8077 shaver would not stay on so I purchased this thinking it would solve the problem. As it turned out one of the release buttons on the side of the shaver head was not working properly. There is no way to purchase just the release button. One must purchase another shaver head motor assembly. Make sure your motor assembly is not causing the problem.
5,tennis player,"this is a great racket! I have not bought a new racket in 5 years,and what a difference it has made in my game! Much better control and less vibration . LOVE this racket..........."
5,Very good quality,I was impressed by the quality of this microscope. It may be for beginners but it has very solid construction and the instructions for what little assembly is required were very clear. Highly recommend this.
3,Needs more true Irish ballads,As usual Hayley sings great. One of the reasons I bought this item I wanted to hear her sing the true Irish & Scots ballads from the ole soil. I did't hear much of that.
3,Amazing vocalist...,"Hayley Westenra is an amazing vocalist, and this album has some very solid songs. However, it doesn't fail to disappoint:-Most of the music on the album is little more than accompaniment to Hayley. If it were not for her talents, I wouldn't be able to listen to the drivel.-The sound quality of the album is awful. Hayley really deserves better. Nearly every song sounds like the gain on her microphone was up too much. The result: every time she hits a high note, it becomes clipped and you miss her accents. Worse, it creates a jarring distortion. (This is exactly how you distort an electric guitar)."
3,Not Picture Perfect,"Fortunately, the CD plays without problem. After waiting for it just under a month to arrive, I was disappointed that the case was quite scratched and the CD itself untidy. And yet, for the price this music is well worth it."
5,"Great Movie based on ""The Flight of the Reindeer""","Excellent movie! I love Richard Thomas as the professor obsessed with proving that reindeer can, indeed, fly! Beau Bridges as ""Nick"" is also wonderful. The sets are great too - look just as I would imagine Santa's village would look. Saw this last year on TV for the first time and am looking forward to receiving my very own copy!"
4,A enjoyable Christmas fantasy,"Thomas and Bridges do a great job of making this a Christmas must have movie. Although the story is very fictional, (or is it?), it is a movie the whole family can enjoy."
3,Boxers with a big designer logo,"A good buy for a bachelor who sleeps (and maybe their morning business) in their boxers and have no one else in the house besides maybe a banging hot guest who spent the night.Nothing special to these boxers compared to boxers available from Fruit of the Loom or Hanes except that these feel more rugged. It's 100% cotton, but feels like nylon - coincidentally, it feels like the same fabric used for flags."
2,"Great idea, poor quality","The concept is great, but the quality of the components are fairly low which did affect the ease of assembly. Make sure to get the assembly dowels in far enough or they break through the top and don't even slightly hit anything except the dowel or you'll end up with a huge chunk missing."
3,Does the job.,The organizer works to sort papers but it does look cheap and the shelves slide out too easily. It is easier to pull the whole shelf out to get the paper than to try to get a paper off the shelf. I am glad I have something to organize with but I would like a little more quality next time I order one.
5,Great series!,"This entire series is just so wonderful! I love the fun way it goes about the science. It is funny, but still manages to hit some points!"
5,There's Never a Dull Moment in Eureka!,"I can watch Eureka over and over again. I love seeing the writer's imagination become a reality. Usually after time-traveling into the past, everything is put back the way they were..not this time. My favorite show was the ""bank robbery"" and the look on Carter's face!"
1,Who buys half seasons? Smart guys thats who.,"Anyone that buys half seasons of any show, or incomplete seasons for that matter is just plain dumb. In buying partial seasons, you support higher costs offered by the producing company. They do it to make more money. Be a smart shopper and demand the abolishment of partial seasons. By not buying them, they cannot make money and thus could end our suffering of partial seasons."
2,ASS,This album blows. The only thing that saves this album from a 1 are Ritchie Blackmore's guitarwork and Cozy Powell's drumming (R.I.P.).Gram Bonnet's voice really sucks. A poor man's Rob Halford.
2,Worst Rainbow album.,"Bonnet has a great voice, but no wonder Dio left the band: Blackmore was going for a total mainstream assault, and he chose to play almost pop metal! DOWN TO EARTH is bad, very bad. It starts with a disgusting bad songa calling MAKIN LOVE (how creative...), which seems like a KISS left over... Thatn things go worser and worse from there, fo course with some good moments due to Ritchie's genius."
3,Not THAT bad,"I just got this cd in the mail even after reading the bad reviews. I'm a big fan of Ritchie Blackmore and Rainbow so I got it nevertheless. This album wasn't as bad as it was made out to be by prior reviews I've read. No one can deny the fact that Graham Bonnet is a great vocalist, even if he was only around for this one album. The songs here are not bad. I think if they all had the energy of ""All Night Long"" the cd would be great. Maybe if Ritchie's riffs were more powerful or crunched harder. Remember, in any lineup, Rainbow was always an all star cast of excellent musicians, and this effort is not different. I think if you're a Rainbow fan, or Blackmore fan, or even a fan of great musicianship, you'll be o.k. buying this."
2,Rainbow - 'Down To Earth' (Polydor),"Originally released in 1979, as this was Rainbow's fourth 'actual' album. Unfortunately,Ronnie James Dio's replacement for frontman / lead vocalist, Graham Bonnet just does NOT fit the bill. Not even close. 'Down To Earth' was the only Rainbow lp that Bonnet appeared on.Thank goodness for that. For some reason(s), I've personally never cared that much for him. Upside is that former Purple mate, bassist Roger Glover joins Ritchie Blackmore and Rainbow, so some of the tunes here are (how should I say it?)somewhat memorable. Like, ""All Night Long""(the old MTV video is okay), ""No Time To Lose"", ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""Love's No Friend"". Pretty much for Deep Purple, Blackmore and Rainbow die-hards."
4,"Scorching guitars, definitely not the norm","Well the lyrics can be a bit silly, some of them kind of remind me of the 'Monster Mash', not thats necesarrily bad. The lightness of the lyrics are offset by the guitarist who is a force of nature. From early albums to this one the guy shows a lot more control and power. You cant help but focusing on him during the songs, I think the producer picked up on this because the guitars seem to be in the front.Great stuff thats different but isnt trying to be different just to pose.Buy this album!"
3,Good Story,"Another new Kindle release of Rimmer's back list.The hero comes across a little immature in the beginning, but improves as the story progresses. The 13 year old was realistically, but tiresomely, adolescent. I liked the heroine's relationship with her mother and the brief glimpses of her life as a teacher. (But she never reflects on her students: grading papers, relationships with coworkers, concerns over a new principal, but nothing about her students.)Actually, I liked a lot about the heroine, in general - except how sad she was. The entire tone of the book is melancholy, which is the exact opposite of what I am looking for in a romance. If this doesn't bother you, you will probably enjoy this well characterized story."
1,Does It really works?,"I'm done with the viatmins and even that I took them as directed, I haven't seen any improvement in my hair and/or nails."
3,Did double growth rate,"I took these pills for two months in order to give it a true chance.You take 8 pills a day, for me I would try to space them apart by 4 hours each set.The company promises double growth rate. Since I grow only 1/4"" per month this would equate to 1/2"" per month. After two months I can say thats exactly what I got, one inch of growth.For me paying $50 a month for this is borderline worth it lol. I say borderline because I would rather have a half inch then what I was getting. But all in all it is expensive for me to pay this monthly. Taking 8 pills a day is hard, especially when you are out doing something, I would sometimes miss a dose.Will I buy them again? I am off to try new supplements and if they dont get me the same amount of growth I will be back!"
2,A real bomber!,"I was flattened by Deighton's ""Bomber"" and was so excited to read one of his about fighter pilots. I was disappointed by this book, maybe my expectaions were too high. More of a historical romance really, read: Harliquin with more research. The detail of the Mustangs was bullet-proof when Deighton gets around to it but there just wasn't enough action in the novel. Slow-paced and torturous to finish in the end, the climax losses it's shock because by that time you just don't care who survives. There is almost too much depth in the characters in that it becomes a real bore. If you like stories about wartime life not involving a lot of combat then this would be a great book, but it wasn't for me."
3,Check if you don't want to get a refund!,"This indeed is a perfect add-on to your notebook that you'll enjoy a lot UNLESS your pcmcia controller is not by the company ENE. If it is, there is NO WAY that you can get a clean sound in all applications, so check your hardware with a system analysis tool before your purchase to save you from weeks of forum reading with no result."
5,"Great For Drool, Bottle Feeding","We love these soft, terry bibs for our three month old baby. We love that they are reversible. We use them every time we bottle feed to gently catch the drips. The bibs are soft enough that we can wipe her face with them. I would not suggest them for children eating solids; the loosely loopy terry might not mix well with purees. But they are the right size for a small baby, perhaps up to a year who drinks from a bottle or drools a lot. They are soft, nicely unadorned, and the velcro is strong and substantial. The only complaint is that with velcro that strong, you cannot undo the bib with one hand and the sound of the velcro opening up can startle the baby if we go too fast. Some consumers complained that they don't wash well, but we have found them to wash well if we fasten the velcro before washing and/or putting them in a mesh bag with any other velcro items."
2,didn't last,I bought these before my daughter was born and found them extremely useful at first. My three month old is a serious spitter upper and needs bibs to keep from wearing 10 outfits a day. These were the perfect size and really absorbent but they did not survive the washing mashine. They fell apart and now I keep them as back up but only at home because they look so beat up. Too bad.
1,Could Have Been a Terrific Overview,"I had purchased this book years ago when it had been first purchased as a booklet. The author has drawn upon the base booklet and expanded it into a full ""volume"", yet the prose content has not grown at all. Most of the visual examples are circa the 1970s, which is a total disappointment as so much has evolved in graphic design since the 1970s!If you're looking for idea starters you may find them here. But, if you're looking for something to mimic, that may be of the times, this book is truly disappointing.I really wish that I could offer a better response, but the book is not worth the paper it is printed on.There are many better ideas to be found (and in full color) simply by using goggle to search for ""designer resumes"" or ""new media resumes"" or similar terms.Perhaps it is because I knew the author's original work (which was avant gard at the time) that I was SO very disappointed in what is shown here. You're better off spending your money and time elsewhere."
3,Not what I am looking for ...,"I live in Japan and I like cabinet-making. I would love to learn how to make the old furniture I see around me: the joinery, the staining, the tools you use, but it seems all I find is how-tos or picture books about temples and huge structures ...Temples are fine, but how about small drawers and tables?"
3,Decent Jointer,"I purchased this jointer due to Delta's reputation and I'm somewhat pleased with it. The cuts are accurate, smooth and it seems to be dependable. However, the chip collection doesn't work very well, if at all. Somehow,they get bunched up in the cutter and shoot out the top onto the table. This is a nuisance and does interfere with smooth operation. Also, it would be nice if the tables were a little longer. All in all, this jointer does a decent job. But, you really should spend a couple hundred dollars more for one with longer tables and a chip shute that actually works. I must also mention that the paint is just not up to par with the good ole days of US made Delta machinery. It makes me mad everytime I look at this jointer. American people and consumers worked hard to build these companies only to be stabbed in the back in the name of greed. What a shame!"
1,Doesn't work,"This device didn't work on my XP OS PC (Pentium IV at 3 GHZ, 1 GB ram, 160 HDD). I did have video but not sound. After downloading the updated drivers, I got sound for a while and then not sound at all...unless you download the drivers AGAIN!!Get yourself instead a PCI TV tuner card..."
1,Supposing,This was a terrible book that children should not read. It opens up crazy thoughts in a person's mind that they shoudn't think about. You don't write a children's book that thinks about taking old hair from a barber shop and mailing it to people you hate. There are more crazy thoughts like this one in the book. DON'T LET KIDS READ IT
5,Best acting book ever!!!!,"An Actor's companion is the book for all aspiring actors and all veterans out there who need a way of working. It takes all the mystery and pain out of acting. No Method, Meisner,Stanislavski, Adler or Morris need apply! It breaks down what acting really is on a simple and doable level. Acting is about relaxation, so you have access to your talent. These simple yet effective exercises free whatever talent may lie within you.Simply, it helps you get out of your way. An incredible find."
2,Fair Game,"Matilda Graham is young, beautiful and an actress playing a game. The Duke of Arden is enamored with her. Though he has a bride-to-be he offers Matilda a proposition: to become his mistress. Somehow I didn't think that was flattering and even though a romance starts I didn't enjoy the characters. I struggled to feel either of them really loved each other. If this was a modern romance I could see marriage and then a divorce some years later. I felt the 'Duke' was shallow and use to getting his way. Matilda lacked maturity in some areas. I know, I know, what did I expect? It is a regency romance and these things occur. Still I didn't care for the story and can't recommend it."
3,not to my liking,I felt that the crux of the movie was to be how much Elizabeth and Darcy did not like each other and how that changed over time. I never bought into that in this movie. I got the impresion they always liked each other from the start.
3,Preferred Colin Firth's,I preferred the BBC 2006 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle but this was one was still ok. It went by so fast though...unlike the 6 hour 2006 version.
2,HD DVD,"Be sure to note that this is an HD DVD and can only play on HD DVD players, which are, for the most part, not sold anymore. There are a few Blu-ray players that can also play HD DVDs, but they are difficult to find.Pride & Prejudice [HD DVD]"
3,3 stars because it is a good movie,this movie does not have a steady picture. it makes me dizzy to watch it. super bad quality.
2,Doesn't measure up to the BBC version,"If you love the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you'll be disappointed with this one."
2,uhh...,You might want to make sure you have a HD DVD before purchasing it so you don't experience the same problem I did.
2,Disappointed,I admit I am a fan of the longer and older version. I did buy this edition in Bluray and never saw it in any other format. I did not like the seting at all. Mr. Bennett must have had some income since he was worried about it all being entailed. I cannot picture a pig wandering through the hallway etc. The acting was very good but I missed some of the detail in the longer versions ability to get to know the characters better. I think except for lydia and Darcy this was an excellant casr wasted on a mediocre script and poor staging.
1,Disappointed,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I was very disappointed when the DVD would not play in my VCR."
2,Disappointing,"This movie is ridiculous! Although visually pleasing, this movie fails to develop any of the characters and plods along like a bad high-school production. The drama of the story is completely lost and the sentiment of the film is not true to Jane Austen's novel. All of the characters are dull stereotypes and the acting by Keira Knightly is laughable to say the least. She is not capable to conveying the wit, passion, and complexity of Elizabeth Bennett.See this movie if you must but don't expect it to replace the Colin Firth version by BBC"
4,I never read the book but I definitely enjoyed the movie!,"This is a wonderfully made film, one of those well-crafted pieces where every frame could be a painting. The performances were fantastic and as someone who has never read a Jane Austen book or seen a Jane Austen film adaptation (unless you count ""Clueless (Special Whatever! Edition)"") I was very new to this world. And I liked it! The ending of the movie is what really got me, that and the score. The piano score was perfectly lovely, and I may have to buy it on CD.The extras on this DVD don't add much of anything. Director Joe Wright's commentary is dull as dishwater and the interviews with the cast are repeated on different special featurettes to the point where you benefit the most from watching only one of them. But overall, if you somehow missed this gem, I suggest renting it and catching up because it's well worth your time!"
1,Bad casting,"I heard the reviews that this version was not even close to BBC series. I believed and didn't even bother to watch. Than I saw MacFadyen in Little Dorrit (Charles Dickens story) and I was left absolutely astonished by his work. Wanting more of his acting I purchased this one. What a disappointment! Everything is great in this movie EXCEPT for the actors or their portrayal of Austin's characters by the makers. Knightley made Lizzie look stupid with her out of place grins and smirks. Macfadyen's Darcy is too soft. Mr. Collins is not funny. Authors mocked his height. Is it all that you can laugh at in this character?!! I don't think so. They also made Bingley look absolutely dumb. Although I loved the cinematography, music, and costumes, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. Irritated most of the time. Sorry. Don't understand some exalted reviews posted here. As for MacFadyen - watch ""Little Dorrit"" BBC series, he is absolutely adorable there. Darcy is not for him for sure."
1,Horrible disappointment and waste of two hours,"Hollywood does a very good job of cheapening most stories, this one included. In this rendition, Jane Austen's work is deformed by Hollywood's need for sensuality and melodramatics. Don't waste two irretrievable hours of your life on this offensive slop."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Everything about this adaptation was wrong, wrong, wrong!! But the worst part of it was the casting of Keira Knightley as Eliza Bennett! What were they thinking!? All Ms. Knightley could do in her role as Eliza was snarl, giggle or make herself so totally obnoxious that I couldn't watch the movie in its entirety. Elizabeth Bennett was a high-spirited, witty and warm LADY and Knightley's interpretation was anything but lady-like! Don't waste your time with this version of P&P - watch the Elizabeth Garvie/David Rintoul adaptation. It's true to the book and would've made Jane Austen proud."
2,NO NO NO!,"Maybe I shouldn't be writing a review - after all, I only made it through perhaps the first 20 minutes of this film. If you have seen the BBC miniseries (as I have), or read the book (likewise), this can be nothing but a disappointment. I really don't know how it couldn't be. The movie rushes through the story and I don't know how anyone could follow it. With the exception of Mr. Darcy (no one could ever be sexier in the role than Colin Firth), the actors here are better looking than in the BBC production, but in the end, who cares? It's just not worth it."
3,P&P Review,"I have seen many versions or shall we say productions of Pride and Prejudice and this adaptation is far off the mark IMHO. Jane Austen never depicted her characters in such a low class style. The characters are seductive and appear cheap and even whorish. If this Mr Bennett is a ""gentleman"" than Lady Catherine is right to consider him not one. Colin Firth depicts Mr Darcy as arrogantly prideful and in this version Mr Darcy seems angry and rather sad all the time. I do not think that this adaptation truly developed the characters as the BBC adaptation did so elegantly. You barely knew the characters at all and most of them truly had no depth. I really disliked Mrs Bennett in the BBC version but in this one she was somewhat likable. Mr Collins was barely able to be despised. Overall I think it it a poor excuse for a work so fine as Jane Austen wrote.ElizabethTrinity, AL"
2,Uugggh!,Really disappointing in comparison to the A&E production. Read the book and you'll realize the difference. A&E was faithful to the book and to the time period; an excellent series. This might appeal to some but is nowhere near the quality interpretation of the A&E/Colin Firth series.
4,Excellent movie,"I like that this version of the story is well done, but still lets the nuances of the time the story was set in come through. Great choices for actresses and actors!"
5,Pride & Prjudice,"Very good acting and beautiful scenary. Set in eary 1800's this is my favarite version, this movie made me like Kyra and this is my favarite Mr. Darsy. I have watched this movie many times, and so have my friends."
5,Absolutely Awesome Movie,"I never saw Pride & Prejudice when it was in the theaters. In March I saw it for the first time on a cable tv program and was absolutely enthralled! The storyline is great, the actors/actresses were all superb and the scenery was breathtaking. I know that Keira Knightley was nominated for best actress that year and I can see why. She is amazing. I also think that Matthew MacFadyen brought just the right touch to his portrayal of Mr. Darcy. He was sexy, dreamy, and sensitive. I bought this DVD so that I could watch this romantic movie whenever I wanted and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get caught up in another era."
5,"Only problem, I watch it too much...","Best, most dream-inspiring story ever written and an absolutely wonderful film adaptation. I own both this one and the A&E; version (also wonderful - I love Colin Firth). This one was soooo beautifully filmed and well done. The actors were all very well cast and did their parts incredible justice.Please, no one wake me and tell me that Keira Knightly is not Lizzie and that Matthew McFayden isn't Darcy, or that there is such a man or such a love somewhere in the world. They were perfect and I want to imagine that they still enjoy each other's beautiful company at Pemberly.If I ever watch this movie and don't have my head cocked dreamily to the side with tears streaking my face as he says 'Mrs. Darcy' over and over at the end, know that my heart has gone cold.When you need to escape, this is the dvd to put in..."
2,A Guy's Review,"If you rent this movie for the car chases, you will be very disappointed...there are none.Besides that point, there were several things I didn't like. For one, the special effects were terrible. The CG teacups looked COMPLETELY fake. Also, I couldn't understand a word that was said, as it was all spoken very quickly, in whispers and in heavy accents. The dance numbers were terribly choreographed, and frankly unimpressive. They looked nothing like the dancing in ""Step Up""The only thing I liked was Darcy. The actor who played him was marvelous, conveying all the emotions you could think of in both his voice, and his expression.Another bad thing is the plot. It didn't even make sense. It's no wonder the author who wrote the book isn't well known or anything..."
2,Movie buff....,"I HAVE TO SAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT LOVE STORY- I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW, AND WAS BLAH, BORING ON MOST SCENES. THE PREVIEWS ON TV MADE THIS MOVIE LOOK REALLY GOOD, BUT AFTER WATCHING IT WAS A BIG LET DOWN."
4,Great Movie!,"I really like this movie! I've seen other versions of Pride and Prejudice, but this is my favorite version. It's a great love story and very well acted!"
4,Love Jane Austin,"This was an entertaining movie. I had read the book and seen the movie before, but it still kept my attention, and still touched me."
2,A Fan of Austen But Not of this Film,"My continual question to myself while watching this movie was, ""Why?"" For spot-on casting and faithfulness of dialogue, I do not think the Ehrle/Firth version can be improved upon. This version has modern-ish undertones that rob it of the essential Austen reticence and modesty. True, it isn't as glaringly awful as the Hollywoodized MANSFIELD PARK, but why, since the BBC version captured Austen's spirit so exactly, would one bother to do a remake like this? Above all, it escapes me how so many Austen fans could overlook the extensive alterations in dialogue, which occasionally made me cringe. And the scene with the statues--what was the deal with that???It is unpleasant to feel impelled to critique negatively a film so universally praised. However, I stand by my view that the latest P&P; fails to enhance the public's understanding of Austen's writing and thinking.In giving the film 3 stars, I am tipping my hat to its breathtaking scenery."
2,This Production Dumbs the Main Character Down,"The main character in this movie is a person of few words and blunt statements, which is the opposite of what the main character of the novel is. She should love language, revel in banter -- everything the film version does not offer. Without this love of spoken language, the character is unbelievable when she actually speaks the lines of the novel's character in important scenes. Suddenly, her speach becomes elevated and exacting, whereas she normally just grunts responses. In fact, this is about the worst script version of the story have seen. It seems that the makers of the movie didn't believe that a modern audience could appreciate a literate character, so they dumbed her down."
5,Timeless Classic,I absolutely love this movie. Having seen the different versions of this movie. I can positively say that this doesn't disapppoint. This is positive and uplifting Keira Knightly plays a excellent heroine. It has a well-rounded cast which makes this movie exciting to watch. This is a must purchase.
1,Pride & Prejudice - Keira Knightley,"What a disappointment!! My mother and I have loved the book, reading it many times over and found the BBC production amazingly accurate. But this one was so off we couldn't watch it. It was so obviously Americanized and did what so many productions of classics do, they play fast and loose with the plot and miss the subtleties completely. Nothing seemed be right, the mood, the dress, the actors all too modern, too flimsy. I found the scenes dark and much of the sound too low. We would highly recommend the BBC version but for those who love the book stay away form this one."
2,Period Piece - circa 2005,"The best costume dramas are the ones in which you can't easily place the time in which the film was produced. This one, unfortunately, was obviously produced in the early 21st century, what with the young ladies screeching and hooting in the parlor like guests on The View. Stick with the A&E version!"
5,Good Price,"Good product for the price, cant go wrong with HD quality of the Blu Ray, plus the digital copy included."
5,Love it,This movie was delivered to my home in a timely fashion. Great quality. And the price was not expensive at all..You just want to make sure when your ordering the dvd..that you order the right format.
2,Very Pretty -- but Disappointing,"Being an annual reader of Pride and Prejudice and a lover of Jane Austen's humor and insight, I found this film to be at best disappointing. Austen's humor was lost in translation to say the least. Elizabeth Bennet was morphed into a dreamy eyed, slightly naughty, tousled haired temptress. Her father, Mr. Bennet, was, despite the acting talents of Donald Sutherland, transformed into a frousled, woolly, bumbling father who simply didn't know how to be a parent. All that aside, the photography is lovely, the costumes are beautiful, and the soundtrack is delightful, but this simply isn't Jane Austen. For a proper film version of this wonderful book try the A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle or the BBC. The A&E version may six one-hour episodes, but, with minor alterations, it's magnificently produced, witty, beautifully acted, and absolutely true to the book and entirely in keeping with Austen's writing."
5,Lovely adaption of the novel,"I have seen both the 95' version with Firth and Ehle and this one with Keira and Matthew. I have to say that I liked the 2005 version much better. I just didn't feel the chemistry between Firth and Ehle. And they seem a lot older than the characters in the book. Colin Firth too I felt was too stiff faced and did not bring out the emotion or torment he felt. He keeps staring at Ehle like he wants to hit her.I thought Matthew Macfayden was a real find in this movie. He really seemed to bring out all the range of emotions he felt. Keira knightly too was very good in her role.The movie though I felt was short and had some scenes I would have liked to see cut out, was a wonderful adaptation of the novel itself.The rain scene where Darcy proposes and the last scene where he comes at dawn to talk to Lizzie was spot on. I couldn't have asked for a better adaptation there.On the whole if you have read the book this movie is a must see."
3,"Good, but not Amazing.","I bought this movie because I love Jane Austen's stories and I loved the 1995 version with Colin Firthe. I had seen this movie previously and had enjoyed it enough. It is a good summary for the story, but I would not recommend setting your heart on it as the best. I do love Keira Knightley's acting and I felt she played Elizabeth Bennet rather well in this movie. However, as a Jane Austen classic, this is not the best. I would definitely recommend the 1995 mini-series first, but seeing as that one is 310 minutes long, this one will work for your Jane Austen 'fix'. =)Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)"
2,Pride & Prejudice,"I ordered the wide screen version and it only plays on one DVD player, not the one we take when we travel, which is what I had wanted. It was a disappointment. So, be very careful which view you order. I didn't really know there was a difference."
5,Without comparison,"This version of Pride and Prejudice is what got me to pick up Austen's book in the first place. Since then I have watched the BBC version a number of times and rewatched this version countless others. I have come to the conclusion that a blend of the two would be perfect, but since that won't happen this is my first choice. There is no correct or incorrect way to interpret literature so there can be no correct or incorrect way to produce a film based on Austen's book.This version is my favorite because it was able to create a chemistry between the characters which, from my viewing, is completely missing in the BBC version. Again, that was my interpretation of it. Don't not view/buy this movie because reviews criticize its lack of authenticity. If you want complete authenticity read the book. If authenticity to the written word was required for every film Hollywood and every film producer would be out of business.."
1,Terrible,I bought this because I love the story and I like Keira. But both were terrible in this adaptation. I can't even sit through the picture. I'm probably going to give this dvd away.
2,Knightley as Cinderella,"Austen races through time in her novel but this movie version skips many good details sadly. This is just, ""Rich man falls in love with poor woman."" Obviously the star is Knightley but in the original BBC movie (still the best) and the book it is both Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The lines were so fast here it was like having a finger on the fast forward. The Bennet's were not so poor that they had pigs in their living room; they were upper middle class so this version is just an ""updated"" fast forward through Cinderella-type story lines. Key lines were said so quickly there was little enjoyment. Better to read the book or - still better - go get the 1995 version with Ehle and Firth. Far, far, far better and much more realistic and true to Jane Austen. I'd hate to see this cast do other books that require time - Gone with the Wind or War and Peace. Ghastly."
5,One of my favorites!,This is one of my favorite books and movie adaptations. Love that you can download it from Amazon and play right away on your computer. Highly recommend.
2,Not worth owning.....,"This version of the Pride & Prejudice is not worth owning....rent and watch the movie, you'll know what I meant. I would strongly recommend the other version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle being the actors/actresses of Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennet in the movie. I daresay, this version is very well presented."
2,Disappointing and Confusing,This movie was the most disappointing version of Pride and Prejudice yet...There was so much of the story left out that if you had never read the books you'd be lost(as were the two people watching with me) The actors were not convincing in their roles. Overall I was very disappointed in this film.
5,Passionate!,This is such a great movie. There is such passion! What a great love story made into a great movie. The actors and actresses were perfect for this movie. There were parts where I wanted Mr. Darcy to just ravish her!!!!!
2,A total let-down after BBC version (and the book),"Why?? Why even attempt to remake a film that was so fantastic? This is like remaking Gone With the Wind. I had high hopes for the movie, with its big budget and great looking cast, but they were not met. The movie departs from the book, and the editing and script do not give enough time or substance to fully develop the characters. The one thing I thought they did well was to depict the country dances as being significantly more back-woods than the ones in town. By the way, I think it's a JOKE that Kira Knightly got an Oscar nod for this performance. P-lease."
2,Fast Forward Version,"This is a fast forward version of Pride and Prejudice. Too many close ups, not enough time for character devolopment. Film didn't show the beauty or romance needed to make me care about this story or these people. Keira Knightly doesn't have the grace posessed by Elizabeth Bennett. I'm glad I rented this, I would never watch it again. It doesn't compare to the Colin Firth version, which I could watch over and over again."
2,Not at all impressed!!!,"I love Pride and Prejudice. It is one of my favourite books and I must have read it at leat 10 times (so far!!!). The BBC adaptation was just perfect. This film was just neither here nor there. I hated the drab set I don't know where they got the idea of the wandering pigs and geese, the Bennets lived on an estate not a farm. and they were gentle folks not farmers.. their future problems would have stemmed from the estate being entailed after Mr Bennets death not from poverty during his life. Keira Knghtely was just plain silly and McFadden just a sulk not a proud man. I hate adaptations that think they know better than original creator... if you don't like Ms Austen's handiwork.. just go ahead and make your own.. just don't call it Pride & Prejudice!!.. Give me the BBC version any time!"
5,Awesome period piece of filming,"I saw this on TV and enjoyed it tremendously, and had to own it. .....beautiful landscapes, scenes, filming & actors- it was just awesome and more true to the book than others I own. (I had to even re-read the book to verify)"
5,A darling beautiful period piece,"Besides Sense and Sensibiliy, this is probably my 2nd fave period film, as well as Jane Austen film. It has just the right amout of drama and humour, all balanced out flawlessly. The acting is top notch and the costumes, beautiful and realistic. The musical score is also very pretty. It is a very serene type of film to watch. You cannot help but smile."
4,YOU CAN'T HELP WHAT YOUR HEART FEELS!!!,"If more women could act like Keira Knightley, they would attract more men. She is strong, bold, smart, witty and confident. She knows what she wants and won't settle. I LOVE THIS MOVIE, IT IS A MUST SEE!"
5,My favorite movie from my favorite book,"I just love this movie. Its long been a favorite, and I finally broke down and bought my own copy. The actors are spot on, and although the script takes a few leniencies with the original material, I love it just the same."
2,Don't waste your money - buy the A&E Version!,"This version of Pride and Prejudice is pretty bad. It is more like a poorly produced junior high play than a movie. Not even Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland can rescue this one. The main actors are so flat. They seem to want to rush through the movie to get it overwith and do not have any stage presence at all. Only the camera angle and choreography of the scenes keeps your attention. The acting of the main characters just isn't up to snuff - at all. Buy the A&E Version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle from Amazon. It is an exquisite version that is exceptionally well done. The ""Americanized"" air of this modern version leaves you wanting to watch the A&E version, even if it is much longer."
3,Two hours can't do it justice,"The acting is decent, though the leads are not at all in the league of Ehle and Firth, from the BBC miniseries. The real problem, however, is that it is an adaptation that tries to shoehorn Pride and Prejudice into a two-hour film. The ""set up"" for many situations is weakened or virtually eliminated, so many scenes lack the punch they should have. I think somone coming to Pride and Prejudice for the first time would be bewildered as to what the 200+ years of fuss have been about. Another serious problem is that this drastic condensing eliminates a lot of the comedy in Austen's novel (that the BBC miniseries preserved) -- the character of Mr. Collins is one example, as is the visit of Lydia and Wickham after their marriage. And the close relationship between Elizabeth and her father just doesn't exist in this one. I'm afraid the BBC miniseries still rules, hands down!"
1,"If you loved the novel, this will be a big disappointment","This version is an insult to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the novel and this movie did not come close to capturing the romance, charm and character of it. It was as if the director hadn't even read or understood the novel. There was no depth to Darcy's character. The most vital points about his honorable character and integrity were left out. Elizabeth's discovery of this was poignant to her falling in love with him. The scenes of their meetings were rushed (probably due to time constraints) one after another when in the book, months go by before they see each other again. The portrayal of the Bennet family is exaggerated. While Austen captures the heart of a woman with the slow and deliberate even agonizing wooing between Darcy and Elizabeth, this movie misses the mark."
4,"Good, but not the definitive version!","I like this version of Pride & Prejudice and love Kiera Knightly, but it honestly can't hold a candle to the 1995 BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle now also out on Blu Ray. That newly restored HD release is simply breath taking (and I'm not that big of chick flick fan!). To each his or her own obviously, but I recomend the five hour BBC version!"
3,Good 70's french symphonic prog,"This is slightly above average mid-70 French progressive rock that reminds me of Mona Lisa but less dramatic. It was produced by Ange's Christian Decamps, and sounds a bit raw to me. But fans of the genre will like this just fine, as the vocals are pleasant, and the moog, synth, and abundant guitar work are all tastfully played. Nothing amazing here though."
2,"Semi-watchable, but no triumph","I have to agree fully with Alexiel's fine review of this film; there's no point in repeating what's been said so eloquently already. It's worth finding and reading. I will add, however, that after seeing this as well as her earlier stuff,it's beyond painfully obvious that Breillat has an agenda and it doesn't include liking men. Her female character's sweeping statements about all men in general are insulting and unintelligent, and having a gay man speak for all men about how they view women is naturally, a bit skewed from the git-go. The sex isn't erotic in the least, and the shock value is so obviously there to shock, it just ends up as cinematic sludge.This is simply not an artistic film, but a dry and fairly pointless one. The ending in particular borders on inane."
2,Slow and Weird,"Some scenes are odd and better off not watching. It's interesting i guess, i do give these people credit for making this film. It depends on what you're into ... wether you will enjoy this film or not. Try not to go by others reviews and opinions always judge for yourself."
3,"Good, Not the Best","All the songs sound very similar, you'll find yourself wanting to listen to something else after about 6 or 7 tracks. Kind of slow, even somewhat boring. But it's not the worst punk album i've listened to."
3,"NUFAN's ""More Betterness"" not their goodest work","NUFANs new album unfortunately can't hold a candle to their previous work. It seems the fellas have slowed their pace and concentrated on meaningful vocals rather than galluping drums and a twinge of anger. A softer album, not slower, but softer."
2,Some Good and Some Bad,"Not all these songs are bad. Some of them were very pretty like ""You've Got a Way,"" but some of them didn't sound good at all like ""That Don't Impress Me Much."" My advice is to listen to the samples."
5,"Be ""Near"" Me Markus!","I don't know what all the fuss is about with this album on Amazon. CHILL! I finally got it today and I think it's one of the best trance artist albums around.Markus Schluz rocks my world and ""Without You Near"" proves he is more than just another disc jockey who can spin other peoples' tunes. He is an artist ... and a musician ... and he's a pretty darn cute dude too. I can't wait to see him spin in MIAMI again. Mmmmm.""First Time"" is my favorite track."
3,Without You Near,"Markus Schulz's newest release ""Without You Near"" leaves me with mixed feelings. I can understand the wide range of reviews here on Amazon. I'm sort of neutral to the whole album.I enjoyed the slower beats on the cd, but that's not what I was expecting to get. Actually some of the actual music on the album is quite majestic, moving and sweeping. It's that sort of epic dreamy dance that sounds so beautiful.If the whole album were like that with minimal vocalists, I'd love it. However, the other reviewers are correct: there does seem to be too many vocals. Markus' music is strong enough to where he doesn't need that many vocals.He's a tremendous producer and the music on here shows it. The vocals were ok for me (I can't say I disliked them, but I definitely did not love them). So overall a three-star release. Maybe worth a Used purchase but definitely not the full retail."
4,Works great.,"I recently added a small shop on my property, I used this internal lock mechanism as a way to secure the door. Normally these type locks mount so the locking bars are horizontal. I rotated it 90 degrees so the locking bars were vertical. It still works great. It is not super heavy duty, but it works fine with the standard T handle, and it was cheap! Perfect solution, arrived faster than expected."
5,Independent Stories that Fit Together,"The art of short story writing is by no means dead. Looking at the stacks of new books and best sellers in a book store today would give you the impression that everything belongs to the full length novel. Alice Munro has created almost a new form of writing. She specializes in short stories that kind of fit together to tell a more complete story of her life.The stories in this book definitely fall into that category. They are individual stories, complete and independent, but taken together seem to represent what has happened to a person going through life and growing up.In the second part of this book, called 'Home' Ms. Munro has said that they had not been published before because they were too personal. This book, along with her other ten collections of short stories and one novel represent a body of work that isn't exactly autobiographical but which seem to represent her life."
1,Really? Don't think so!,"I was going to order the 6 pack based on the positive reviews.I searched all over the net to find the ingredients since theyare not listed ??? I finally found them here:goodguide.com/products/192811-skin-milk-foaming-bathSodium SesquicarbonateSodium Lauryl SulfoacetateFragranceIsopropyl PalmitateSilicaLactoseHydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl PolysiloxaneVitamin D3Vitamin E AcetateRetinol PalmitateMethyl ParabenDMDM HydantoinSee package label ingredientsSeveral are of health concern and it turns out that""Society:This company's social policies, practices and performance place it among the worst/bottom 20% of companies rated by GoodGuide.""I have decided not to purchase based on the above...you may choose to re-think this too."
1,Jaws of Life Required,"As gorgeous as the packaging is, it is nearly impossible to remove the DVDs without a tool of some kind (letter opener used here) and putting your fingers all over the back & front of the disc.I would have let that pass if not for the number of discs that had episodes that freezed up completely. PS: I only used the letter opener on the title side of the disc so I wouldn't damage the recorded side."
4,"Great, but not their best","Reliant K come back with some great sounding music, again! I liked the CD, but unfortuately I was a little disappointed with a few of the songs, which unlike the usual Reliant K where any love song is sung to God, they seem more like teen pop (in the words of a friend), in that, they are simply songs to a girl. No deeper meaning than that.Also disappointing was the song Faking My Own Suicide which talks about faking one's suicide in order to cause someone to love them. The manipulation that the song suggests is not something a Christian should aspire to; beyond that, it is not a good way to start a healthy relationship with someone.Other than that, it's a good CD. I give it four stars because they give about 80% top quality songs."
4,Same old Relient K,"I was excited to finally get this cd after all the buzz about it. However I found myself a little empty after I listened to it. It had good lyrics although not as good as some of their previous albums and it had the good Relient K sound and I enjoyed it. I loved must have something right, the best thing and Give until theres nothing left. My only problem is that all the songs seemed to follow the same format and they didn't place many things to make the chourus or other lines differen then the previous. Other than that the cd's great."
5,Killer Album,"Relient K have not let anyone down with their fifth studio album. It moves with a positive vibe and takes the next step in Relient K's musical journey. The lyrics are clever and true to the point as usual, and their music ranges from softer tunes such as ""Give"" and ""Deathbed"" to more punky rocky tunes such as ""Devastation & Reform"" and ""Bite My Tounge"". Overall, not an album to miss!"

3,William the Curious: knight of The Water Lilies,"Great artwork. Weak story. Actually quiet boring and repititious with the artwork, but artwork once again well executed by Charles Santore. Master at his craft."
1,Complete Poop.,"$18 for two cd's of some cheap covers? Better off buying the Garth Brooks 6 CD Box set ($25 at www.walmart.com). These covers are pretty bad, some are ok, but why bother when you can get the real Garth Brooks? !!"

Way too much for shipping my fault I didn't notice and they didn't ship it until a week after I ordered it. Not worth it.Also chihuahua ate through toy! Not the most durable.

4,Warning About Binding,"Purchased this Bible for our daughter. Content is excellent. Leather binding is very good also, BUT, because of the type of leather used, the local Bible store could not imprint her name on the cover. Reconsider this item if the imprint is important to you."
5,Worth listening to!,Very funny with a good mix of silliness & true-life wisdom. Read by Tyler Perry as his Madea character (and as himself at times) making it more enjoyable to listen to rather than just reading the book.
3,Straight from the horse's mouth,Madea tells it like it is in this entertaining commentary on life experiences. Once you get past the introduction it's fun reading.
4,Review,Good reading. Easy to read. Very interesting to read Madeas reasonings and solutions to everyday problems.
5,A classic of English literature....,"I've read a few of Graves books. Most certainly, he is an accomplished author; most certainly, this is his finest work.This is an old book on an old topic. He is writing on the early life of the Roman Emperor Claudius, a man whom, like most of Roman history, has been forgotten. Because of his talent as an author, the life of Claudius becomes important and something that the reader can identify with: through the intreigues, etc. that he lives through, one becomes forced to compare/contrast many of the intregues, etc. of the present day. Things become not so far off....I read this book for the first time a few years ago when it was placed at something like #14 of the top English language books of the twentieth century: I'd never heard of it, and that seemed wrong. Setting aside a few instances where he plays improperly with history (Nero comes AFTER Claudius) this is a brillaintly written work that should be remembered as a magnum opus of the English language."
2,Disappointing!,"This novel written in 1935 is set as the autobiography of Claudius, before he becomes Roman emperor and as he sees the various members of his family die off, mainly through mischief.It is not particularly well written. How for example can Claudius report word for word conversations that were held hundreds of kilometers away?Also, the characters' psychology is poorly developed and inconsistent. Why for instance would Livia suddenly decide to confide her wrongdoings to Claudius whom she has always despised?Though not graphic by today's standards, violence is so pervasive throughout the work that it becomes tedious.To potential readers interested in an analogous approach to Roman Antiquity, Marguerite Yourcenar's `Memoirs of Hadrian' constitutes a far superior option."
5,One of the best,"Time is short here, so, to the point, this is one of the best historical novels out there. Robert Graves manages to bring imperial Rome to life in a way few could, with memorable characters throughout. This is a must read for anyone that has a fascination for the period."
5,Better than any soap opera you can name!,This is my all time favorite book. You can't help taking an interest in the Roman Emperors and the history of Rome after reading this book. Excellent job by Mr. Graves.
1,Was Rome really this bad????,"I had to read this book for an independent study in Grade 12 English and I can honestly say that I was completely reviled by the utter lack of content in this quasi-classic book. I found there to be no plot and very little substance in the entire book and I am very disappointed in the judgement of the critics who put it #14 in the list of the top 100 books of this century. I cannot say that this book is good because lying is a sin and I don't want to go to Hell. I, Claudius cannot be a good representation of the works of Robert Graves because it is a pitiful example of a book, period.."
1,"Carrie, please don't write anymore books.",Carrie obviously has no clue whatsoever what a feminist is. Feminism never caused women to be disposable sex objects. The idea that women are disposable sex objects is not a new phenomenon- it has been going on since long before feminism became mainstream. To blame feminism on it is ignorant and uninformed. Maybe she should have picked up a history book before writing a book herself.
2,metal madness?,"the only good bands on this album are motorhead and angel witch, the other bands sound like freakin 60s rock-pop."
1,"""Already Dead"" Made Me Wish I Was","It is unfortunate that this novel was ever written. The characters are uninspiring, and the plot is at best plodding. The story is told through the eyes and actions of those either mad, intoxicated or stoned. Accordingly, the text is disjointed to the point of distraction. ""Already Dead"" is eminently forgettable. I felt I had been robbed of the time it took to read this drivel"
3,ruined by rugrats,Take 3 very educational shows and put them with a worthless show in which the kids all act and talk like [imbeciles] and this is the dvd/video. They should keep NickJr. and Nick on different videos.
3,"Flashy looks, durablity of tissue paper.","These gloves are very comfortable. They are a low profile design with flexibility where it matters. The built-in shock protection does a good job against errant hammer blows. All in all, a pretty good glove......until you bring up durablity. I bought a pair of these four weeks ago. As I write this review, I can see whats left of my Series 3.0s in my tool bag across the room. I wore these gloves for a variety of tasks including framing, hanging wood siding, demolition, and masonry. The gloves held together reasonably well until I started moving rocks for a stone walkway. Picking up rocks blew these guys up. There is nothing left of the stiching in the palms now. I give 3 stars because of this lack of durabilty factored with the good to great performance otherwise.So for carpentry and lighter work, these are a fine (although expensive) pair of gloves. For landscaping or masonry, look elsewhere."
4,claire gets caught-alex,"i personally like lucas and zoey the best, they are the cutest! but it [stinks] about claire and jake, how they can't get their relationship to work out. Claire really cares for jake and that when she decides to be a little, or aLOT munipulative and make it so that when she goes to the mountains with the rest of the group, she will make sure that she and jake get back together.. Unfortunatey... the ski trip ends up [badly], i personally think... and i wish that everything were back to the way it was before.... when i read this book i almost started to cry! its so good u feel like you are the characters.. ps benjiman and nina are so cute too"
4,Hard to put down!,This was a great book because EVERYONE had some conflict or misunderstanding! I can't wait to read the next one! I could hardly put the book down because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next! It kept you in suspense all throughout the book!
4,"Old, but very good!!",I had never purchased a Ronny Jordan CD. This was my first one and Im glad that I did. I heard that this CD was his most commercial success. If you're looking for some smooth guitar playing...this is it!
5,SWEET,"A nice touchdown into ""smooth Jazz"" territory from the great acid jazz guitarist.A very underestimated album by lovers of ""brighter Days"" and ""off the Record"" but worth seeking out for Island Paradise which is Jordan at his best and the bass and kick heavy version of u might need somebody.An all round nice album form Londons Finest."
5,I love this trilogy,I have loved The Singer trilogy for years and for some reason had not read this. It captures the essence of how I view creation.
2,Disappointing...,"I didn't hesitate to buy this album after the brilliant performances in YFIIP. However, after listening to them several times, I'm at a loss to explain the incoherent, lackluster quality of these new songs. They ramble on wihtout the melodic and vibrant sound that characterized the last album. As much as I hate to say it, BSS is a real let down."
4,The extra disc is a nice bonus,"I would say they sound like a combination of Arcade Fire and Wolf Parade, with a bit of experimentation for added uniqueness. The sound is powerful and thick and quite rhythmic, some excellent drumming and guitar playing here. I am disappointed that this band is not getting the exposure that they deserve by way of radio and clubs in the U.S. This is one of those CDs that words cannot describe, you just need to listen to it to experience it. It is a very artistic album, with lots of styles in it. Many people here compare this album to their previous one, but it stands on it's own as a great album. I'd say the melodies on here are better than the ones from You Forgot It In People, and the production is a bit bigger. If you like this you may like Arcade Fire or Wolf Parade. The extra disc is a nice bonus."
1,i loved the last one!,"this collective's rendered redundant now--especially as there are NO SONGS here,merely miasmic ""workouts."" i was charmed by the new orderish basslines andurgent vocals occasioned by the stuff on ""You Forgot it in People,"" the debut.this new thing's very very disappointing! meandering fluffy stuff. better recordsto get: SONIC YOUTH, THE BLACK WATCH, YO LA TENGO, SPARKLEHORSE,THE RADIO DEPT. sorry, but the over-the-top packaging (geez, these guys areessaying WAY to hard to be considered as ""artists"") is the quote-unquote best thingabout this. AVOID!!!!"
3,Pretty Good,"I am not a ""hardcore"" Broken Social Scene fan - this is their first album I have bought, and I don't know which of the members were in which songs.However, coming from a completely unbiased standpoint, this CD is pretty good, but not excellent.Every song has a different style, and the music is great to listen to... the first time. But this isn't the kind of CD I would go over again and again. It's just nice, but not great.I'm sure you'd love it if you were a fan of Broken Social Scene, but if not already, listen to the song samples and make sure you like the styles before buying this CD."
2,Not the same,"This album is really terrible. Master P has lost it, The Last Don was aight. Ghetto D was his last tight album. No Limit has gone down. Some may even say Master P isn't bout it no more, what do you think?"
2,Hoody Who?,"I can't belive this is alblum was recorded by the same cat who brought us ""Ghetto D"" and ""MP Da Last Don"". ""Only God Can Judge Me"" is by far the worst Master P alblum yet, and it's probably one of the worst of 1999. First off, the songs are too short and the beats are just plain weak. Second, the lyrical content leaves much to be desired. Granted, the alblum does have some strong points, ""Where Do We Go From Here?"" (featuring Nas and Mac) has some valid lyrics and a good beat, and ""Ain't Nothing Changed"" (featuring Magic and D.I.G.) is just plain spectacular. If you liked ""Ghetto D"" and ""MP Da Last Don"", you probably won't like this alblum, but don't sleep on No Limit just yet, C-Murder, Snoop and Mystikal all have quality music out on the market, so go pick those up instead."
2,Worst No Limit cd in 1999,"I bought this cd just the day it came out because i am a big NL-fan. Ive got all the other MP cd`s but ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME was a big bummer! . I think there are just about 3 okay songs on the cd. RETURN OF DA DON, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE and WHO DOWN TO RIDE. Those three tracks are okay. But i think the rest of the cd got slow and wacky beats and also the lyrics are wack too. Its time for MP to start writing lyrics about something else than just the haters and how poor he and hes brothers was back then. MP is also kinda stealing 2pacs texts and lyrics. I mean ""GHETTO IN THE SKY"" is about the exact same stuff as ""I WONDER IF HEAVEN GOT A GHETTO"" by 2pac. And he should`nt have titled the cd ""ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME"" because thats 2pacs too. But anyway there a little bit of good songs on the album so thats why i give the cd 2 stars. I just hope this was a little screw-up from P and i hope and think the next album from No Limit will be alot better."
5,Very nicely done,"Master P refers back to the steert tactics he used growing up in the hood in every song. He also exhibits extreme anger and hatred towards rival Cash Money Records, yet never outright mentions their name. Some songs are questionalbe as if they are there to fill up space. Most songs however express smooth beats with clear, understandable lyrics. It might not be better that ""Ghetto D"" but it beats ""Da Last Don"" out of the water."
2,It was O.K,"This CD to me, was just like every other NoLimit CD i have ever heard. I mean....if you really wanna save money, donot get this album. As far as i'm concerned, Master P is played out and it is Cash Money's Time To Shine With their New one ""Tha Block is Hot"" by LiL Wayne. THat is what I would Reccomend"
1,bull,"hody hoo my azz, he dont know how to rap. his videos are stupid, no wonder im the first to review it"
2,Master P Needs To Look Into Retirement Again...,"My deepest regret is that I wasted a perfectly good gift certificate to buy this album, but thank god it didnt come out of my own wallet! The production was my biggest problem with the album (it was typical No Limit sound, good enough for the REAL tank hitters, but I expected more from MP). Lyrically, I didnt expect much, but I thought there would be some party jams or music to run the streets with, neither. Nas wasnt as good as I thought, JD, too. Magic seriously needs to get dropped from the label, and Silkk as well as C-Murder didnt come with much, so pretty much the only No Limit Soldier I think that has a future is D.I.G. He needs to get coached lyrically, but I like his flow. Overall, if you're Bill Gates, get it cuz you got enough money to not feel bad about a mistaken purchase, but if not, at least burn it so you wouldnt hafta pay full price. Stick to the REAL westcoast--DoggPound, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger and Hoo Bangin; they're running it all!"
2,ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME,"ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME IS MORE OF A GHETTO FABULOUS ALBUM THAN TRU GANGSTA GANGSTA.P NEEDS TO START KEEPING IT GANGSTA!IT HAS A FEW GOOD TRACKS,SUCH AS ICE ON MY WRIST AND YALL DON'T WANT NONE.OVER ALL I GIVE IT A TWO."
3,Master P or Master Jock?,"This cd is tight as hell, but some of the songs beats sound dead up like ones on other artists records. Number 7 for example has most of the beat from Will Smiths ""The Two of Us"" in the mix, but has a little part missing here and there to make it sound like a new thang. Even the albums title is a copy off of one of 2pacs songs (word for word). This is a good cd to kick back to, but whos cd is it? All no limits beats sound the same. They were hot back in the day, but it gets old. Except for Snoop, No Limit is No Tallent."
2,I think Master P should have retired.,Master P should have kept this one to himself. Let Mystikal take over No Limit and sit back and kick it. Holl Holla.
4,Good but Phony,"As a firefighter by trade, I felt, that it was rather over dramatic of a picture in terms of the action scenes dealing with fire fighting. Other than that, It was a well written movie and I would reccomend it to anyone."
4,Great,This was a gift for a family member and it works great for the price I couldn't find it in a lot of places so this was perfect
5,Backdraft ..,"I own Backdraft, and have watched it many times . Though it grows older in age, the plot and just movie in general are timeless . If you aren't sure about buying it , at least rent it . You'll buy it anyway . The tough relationship between the two McCaffrey brothers after their father's death has it's ups and downs throughout the movie, and fires . I highly recommend it ."
5,GREAT movie!,"I've always been enamored with the history and the great work of those who make up the CFD. Having been a volunteer FF/EMT myself, I have an appreciation for the movie and what it did for those in the fire service."
1,Lame attempt at former glory,"Deep Purple reformed the Mark II lineup for this album, but but it falls far short of the Machine Head era. Nowhere near as heavy or complex as the best Deep Purple album ""Burn"". This album is commercial and ultimately forgettable."
5,"""Perfect"". That says it all.","Sometimes a break can really be to an artist's advantage. They come back, refreshed, bursting with renewed enthusiasm & creative energy. Yes's ""Going For The One"", ""Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe"" and ELP's ""Works Vol.1"" come to mind. THIS is another superb example. Anyone trying to be cute might call this ""Machine Head 2"", and they wouldn't be far off. As if they stepped from a time warp, DP Mk2 reunited for the band's finest album since the infamous flare-gun incident. 8 songs. POWERFUL. BLUESY. HARD-ROCKING! ""Knocking At Your Back Door"", ""Under The Gun"" and ""Perfect Strangers"" are my faves, but this time, ALL the songs are equally good. SO good, in fact, that while they've had great tunes since, in my view no album after this has topped it-- or even come close."
2,not what i expected,"I did a pretty thorough search for a book that would cover Mediterranean history, cultures, and geography- and settled on this book as my first choice. I was only able to get through about 1/3 of the book before I lost interest and put it on the shelf.I found it to be primarily focused on leaders and wars, with little insight into the real lives of people. Because of the focus on leaders, the names became (for me) hard to follow and confusing. Each section seems to become predictable- focusing on X leader who brings Y troops to Z land, and either wins/pillages or loses.There are some interesting tidbits that are cited as part of the war stories, including details on post-war carnage, or of leaders who showed restraint. However, not near enough information on the lives of normal people that lived in the Med. region over the past few thousand years."
2,Ruby Gentry Depressing,"This video is typical of many videos filmed in the 50's. Melodramatic to the core. Jennifer Jones as Ruby was not pretty enough to be so desirable; the doctor's role wasn't developed enough, and there were never any bright spots. Ruby lacked wisdom and depth of character. Charleton Heston was pretty shallow, also. I thought the entire plot totally rediculous. I resented the presentation of God and Christianity in the character of Ruby's brother."
5,Fantastic Movie!,"First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Jennifer Jones!!!! So, I love any movie she is in... But, truly, she is great in this movie. A very diverse actress, with an unusual beauty for that time... she plays the part of ""a girl from the wrong side of the tracks"" like no-one else can. Charlton Heston looks BEAUTIFUL as ever, the character he plays is pitch perfect! And the time, place, and era of the film are spot on! Karl Malden is great as well, playing the ""Southern Gentleman"" and father figure to a T.This movie is as intriguing as ""Duel in The Sun,"" in which Jennifer is paired with Gregory Peck.I LOVE THIS MOVIE............"
1,BORING TO THE TENTH DEGREE,"As as avid reader of all literature and a fan of the original Wizard, this was without a doubt the worst book I have ever had the horror of reading. Boring, boring, boring, slow and dismal. I regret having taken it with me on vacation because it bored my whole vacation. I threw it in the trash when I finised it."
5,Very well done,"I have bought this book for everyone I have taken to the play. It is a great introduction to the theater experience, and a treasure to keep after being there. So far I have seen the musical 5 times ang given away lots of books. All of my daughters, daughters in law, and grand daughters have seen it. To a person they loved it."
4,Best Hannukah Gift,I bought this book for my grandaughter who is 14.She was thrilled with the stage play and I wanted her memories to never be forgotten Needless to say she was delighted and she refers to it time and time again.I was delighted with it just for it's appeal in the way it was put together. It is truly a beautiful thing. I'm glad I made this purchase.
2,WICKEDLY DECIEVING.....,"As a ""fan"" of this splendid and inovative AMERICAN musical - I was most eager to finally read a complete script of this elusive show (The Broadway Cast album was no help other than ptinting the lyrics to the songs) - alas, No such luck... The pictures are nice. The binding is excellent BUT no script! If you read the original book - you have clues. But lots of great stuff was left out of the musical."
5,I can't get enough of Wicked!,"Love, love, love this book! As someone who just saw the show for the first time, I left that theatre wanting more Wicked! I cannot get enough! This book is a really good souveneir to have for any fan of the show! I immediately sat down and read the whole Book as soon as it came in the mail, the pictures are wonderful! I definitely recommend this to anyone who has fallen in love with this musical!"
5,Adorably Fun,"Make a date with the beautiful yet quick-tempered Arabellaand her smooth yet arrogant suitor, Mr Beaumaris. The bookis pure, unadulterated Regency romance, where Cinderella findsher Prince despite incorrect pretensions. Arabella is funny andadorable, while Mr Beaumaris can make any girl swoon. The bookwould have read as an inane romance had it not been for thehilarious witticism of Georgette Heyer and her sharp characterization,which can make even the most cynical of all readers smile! Irecommend it at least once, especially when your troublesseem to overwhelm you. And I do guarantee a fun time."
4,"Great for the money. MANY GAMES 3 D CHESS, SOUTHPARK","VERSION OF SUPER MARIO BROTHERS,A compilation of classic PC games including: Bejeweled, Diggin' Jim, Bubble Bobble, Demolition Derby, Elf Bowling, Mario Brothers, Wolfenstein 3D, Connect 4, GSX Snowboard, Dragon Ninja Saga, and more. 500 of the greatest full version games ever created. Packman, Connect-4, Black Jack, and baseball just to name a few. No installing necessary,pop it in, and play. [...]"
1,"Skovhus, you're no Fischer-Dieskau...","I heard only the last song in a radio broadcast. The conductor was impatient, rushing through it. Skovhus' voice sounded very light and there was little inflection given to the words. It felt like a run-through. If you want these songs sung by a male, either of Fischer-Dieskau's recordings brings much more depth, and either has an outstanding conductor. Or wait for Quasthoff to record it, judging by his recent ""Wunderhorn"" disc."
5,The unknown de Larrocha,"My my my... so often we forget that Alicia is not just the amazing pianist who seems to be the only one who can pull off pieces from the spanish repertoire. It was indeed her recording of the Mozart ""sonata facile"" (on RCA Victor) that opened my eyes to classical music. Her mozart is truly magical. In my eyes, this is the real set to get from the great pianists collection. There are much better recordings of her playing the Albeniz, but nowhere but here will you ever find such a wonderful played compilation of 18th century masterworks. Buy in bulk and give them out instead of wafers in communion."
4,A good album for an 80's fan...,"These days, it's not difficult to find music from the 1980s - there are digital music stations, FM radio stations dedicated solely to this decade, and, of course, downloads. However, there are still songs that elude a dedicated 80s fan, and this compilation is a worthy addition to one's collection. Personally, I bought this CD for Deon Estus' ""Heaven Help Me"", but was happy with the other songs, including Hipsway's ""The Honeythief"", ""10-9-8"" by Face to Face and ""No More 'I Love You's'"" by The Lover Speaks (most listeners will be familiar with Annie Lennox's version). There are songs from ABC, Hall & Oates and the Thompson Twins, as well as from more obscure acts like The Models and One 2 Many. Like the album promises, these are the hard to find songs, the ones that have been forgotten (for the most part). If you're looking for 80's pop music other than Rick Springfield, Journey or Pat Benatar, this is the collection for you!"
2,Coleman Dog Bed,"I have had 2 of these, they dont last. After 4-5 months they start to leak air and cant find the leak. I would not recomend any air bed for a dog, it doesnt hold up."
3,A tedious read,"The only saving grace about this book was that the story was interesting. I found it hard to believe that Haley had her MBA and was so sharp, but could not speak proper English. (Mines instead of mine). Bad grammar throughout made the characters credentials inauthentic.All of the throwing around of brand names was one thing, but to quote the cost of each item was just tacky.I am interested to see what becomes of these two lovebirds, but this is a tough book to get through."
4,Great Tool,I purchased this tool after researching the web. Amazon has the best price on the web. The item arrived on time but when I opened the box a little piece of plastic came flying out. When I checked the tool I realised it was part of the button to separate the two parts of the multi-tool. Without this button is almost impossible to separate the tool and to unlock the screwdrivers or the knife once the get into the locked position.The actual tool seems to work great but the missing button makes it a hassle hence the 4 out of 5 stars on the rating.
3,"Well-made, but where's the 5/8"" adjustment?!","Bought this as solve-all for bike needs, especially when out on the road. The spoke adjustment tool is nice, the knife is super sharp, and the slurry of wrenches is nice, but where's the tool for a 5/8"" nut?! My bike does not have quick release wheels, so if i get a flat 20-miles out, I better hope I have a wrench/ratchet in my bag!This thing is pretty hefty already, but I'd take the slight weight gain over having to try to cram yet another item into my under-the-seat bag."
5,Great tool(s),"I haven't had this for too long but have been using it a lot. I've decided to start doing my own maintenance and repairs and this is a great handy tool to take care a lot of what needs to be done. It's quick to just grab this and have almost all that you need at hand rather than searching around for all the various tools you need. Obviously it doesn't include everything you'll need, but it has a lot, including a chain tool that I just used to replace my chain.I also throw it in my bag when I go for a ride and have used it several times out on the road.It's very solidly made and you can tell that it will last a long time."
3,Everything you need but too clunky to use it all,"I purchased this tool mainly because I wanted the chain tool and figured it would be nice to have extra tools as well. Unfortunately, even when broken in half its pretty much useless for working on disk brakes. I have a 26"" wheeled mountain bike and I could not for the life of me use the 2mm hex key or the 4mm hex key to perform adjustments on my rear disk brakes.I would suggest getting several smaller tools in lieu of purchasing this multi-tool because it's kind of clunky and awkward to use. Also several smaller tools will probably be easier to stow in a pack. I am giving the alien 3 stars because you can still use it in most places provided the fasteners are in easy to reach locations and the chain tool is nice."
4,great tool,"Topeak Alien II 26-Function Bicycle ToolWow what a great device. Instead of husband lugging 4-8 tools in pouch that rips because of weight we had this tool. We took 11 mile bike ride in Cades Cove no help except on your own if you break down. All 11 bikes and family did fine. Several bikes needed adjustments and this tool handled all the problems that occurred like a champ.Thanks for thinking of it . I would call it ""The McGyver"" bike tool no duct tape included !!!"
2,bike tool,when i got the tool the button was broke off in the bag that was a bummer.Other than that its great just hard to open with the button broke.
3,Good Item,Macgyver would be Proud to see anyone with this tool.Small but has all the Allen wrenches I need for my bike.Even has a chain tool !!!
1,Totally Wrong Item,"Ordered this Topeak Alien II 26-Function Bicycle Tool on the ""Cyber Monday"" deal and instead received a Topeak Pocket Rocket bicycle pump with the sticker for the Alien II stuck on the package. Waiting to see if the exchange for the proper item goes smoothly or not. Never had this issue on an order before."
2,Way to heavy,"It would be impossible to bike with this tool. It is very heavy. I wanted something simple to bike with. However, this tool would be good to use around your garage for fixing bike."
2,Plastic Frame,I wish I had read the description better before buying. The frame is made of plastic and bends when the tool is used. I imagine it shattering when I drop it or use it.I would have gotten a similar tool with a metal frame had I read more carefully.
3,Great tool - with a belt clip??,Do you wear a belt when you ride? I don't either. I doubt the Topeak people do either. So why make me discover I have to buy the 'Fixer' (ironic eh?) mount separately in order to attach this beast to my bike?$8 more bucks to do so is annoying too.Include the mount!
3,turkish not delight,"Service & delviery was great, product was less then good.. Ehh..ok..but too expensive.not best ."
2,Good idea - needs work,"On page 20 I learned that Alechemy was, really, about changing material things (and not spiritual things) but this kind of esotericism might be missed w/o a fascination with religious history.On page 26 I learned that Gerald Ford was president in 1970, granting Amnesty to Vietnam Draft Dodgers... (Nixon was President then...)On page 32 I learned that the Aryans got their name from Arius of Alexandria (confusing ""Arians"" and ""Aryans"").... The content shows a distinct lack of research in several areas. The scope is wide and wonderful and I would have been happy to add this to my trivia collection, but I can't trust any of it given the amazing errors I've found in the first 30 pages."
3,(3-1/2 stars) Tolerable,"This song isn't exactly wack, and it gets mad airplay, but when you listen to the lyrics, you have to admit the song isn't saying much. The verses aren't much more than ten seconds long, and the chorus just says ""Why don't we, why don't we, why don't we fall in love"" (by the way, Amerie needs better background singers). Another concern I have is the 1990-flavored remix featuring Ludacris. What I mean by that is that there is no change to the song's music whatsoever, and Luda only shows up at the very beginning of the song and again right before the last chorus. Other than all that, the song is still listenable."
4,30 Seconds over Toyko,This was writen by a survivor of the Toyko raid. This is what the movie of the same title is based on. It is very good.
4,Interesting version of Australian History,"A great read for anyone who would like to seek another view of Australian history, Strange Objects is a compelling story that challenges the very foundations in which we base the history of our country.Its combination of different items, make for many plots and subplots, which are brilliantly woven together at the end of the story. A must for anyone who is interested in Australian history, or the contempory issue of the 'Stolen Generation'."
4,a very interesting book,"I don't really like to read, but I did enjoy this book. I thought that because it was so interesting and different it kept me wanting to read more. I've never read a book quite so strange."
1,"Horrible, horrible ""music""",this is the absolute worst cd ever created. anyone who is thinking of spending their hard earned money on this so-called music is simply insane.
5,This CD is GREAT,"Let me tell you, I bought the CD for the song When Worlds Collide, and at the end I like all the songs. I like to whole spacy sounds and rock blended toghter in this album. Anybody would have there body jumping after they here this album. If I could rate this album more then 5 stars I would give it 10 stars. If your looking for louds sounds this is your CD."
4,Man or Astroman? meets Gwar meets Hole.,"Like being smacked in the head with a dirty shovel.Fun little sci-fi drop ins, insanes juxapositions from even-metered voice overs to savage screaming...I like it.There is little chance you play this album a lot. But it is a daring balst of savagery, unusually well produced for something this coarse.This would probably make a lousy mother's day gift."
4,Men In Spacesuits? Songs of Robots? Oh My!,"Powerman 5000 (PM5K) is one of the best new metal bands around. Songs like ""Supernova Goes Pop"", ""When Worlds Collide"", ""Nobody's Real"", ""Tonight The Stars Revolt!"", & ""Automatic"" really stand out with their eerie lyrics and heavy sound. PM5K's singer, Spyder1, is the brother of Rob Zombie, by the way. Buy this if you are a fan of:1.Rob Zombie2.Static-X3.Disturbed4.Ozzy Osbourne5.GodsmackYou'll Be Glad You DiD!tm"
3,Not a bad cd all in all,"Its not a bad cd really. Only a couple songs on it are really good, but the best is ""When Worlds Collide"", which stands out from all the others. If you are a true fan of hard rock, this cd is a must buy."
5,Powerman 5000=Powerful music,"I love this cd. I just bought it today, and I haven't heard it all yet, but I love it. This music can not be classified as heavy metal, rock, or anything else. It can only be described as loud, powerful music that is unlike the other metal out right now, like Limp Bizkit and Korn (don't get me wrong, I love Limp and Korn, but this isn't a Limp album in the least!). If you wanted a comparison to another band out here, or want something like this album, try Disturbed's album ""The Sickness""."
5,It rocks!,"This is one of the best cd's i have ever bought and when i first heard it i thought it sucked , but once i listened to it it grew onto me , although people think this ong sucks , but i think that""Blast off to Nowhere"" is the best song , also Tonight The Stars Revolt is an awesome song. This CD is awesome!Nuff said................."
1,This Cd Is A Big Let Down,I bought this cd a few days ago. After a few listens i thought this cd was boring. Songs like when worlds colide get really old after a while. This cd is pointless to hear or even buy.
3,"Love Shiva, but not so fond of this cd",I was excited to find this because I've studied with Shiva Rea and always liked the music she used in class. But this seems like a jumbled mess to me. There's no particular pattern to the flow of music which there is in a yoga class. And some of the tracks jus don't seem to fit with a yoga practice at all. Hate to say it but I'm really disappointed....
4,"A sultry, warm collection of ""techno"" ballads","As the top of the CD wrapper reads: ""Ten ballads for the t*ts, bums, and mickeys of beverly hills."" Essentially what you are getting is an evokative downtempo disc, with relatively lush insturmentations (lots of accoustic guitars, live bass, very organic overall). The lyrics are completely forgettable overall, but the singing adds to the sultry, hot-summer night feel of the disc. The feelings of seduction are all over this disc, and it's easy to imagine this being played in the background of the ""makeout room"" at some house party somewhere in LA."
2,Not so great,Says it holds 300lbs my husband is 6'3 260 and the leg bent after 1 night of him sleeping on it. the games were fun though. I dont think this holds up to 300lb so if you are a bigger guy try a different cot.
5,Good book,I thought it sounded good and I find it's very good right from the start. I was glad I chose it and I would recommend it to others.
5,Ryan's Return,I thought in the beginning that this book would be the same old plot... but Barbara kept many of the details of the puzzling plot secret until the end. She kept my interest throughout the book. Her characters are real and believable. I enjoyed every minute. It as an easy read and an enjoyable escape.
1,horrible,I don't know how this book got almost four stars rating..it was so predictable..such waste of my time..I wish I had not relied on readers ratings on this one..
4,Predictable but enjoyable,Freethy did a great job in allowing the reader to connect with each character. The plot was good too. I just felt I was reading a drawn out harliqiun romance too much of the time it was good but I often found myself accurately predicting the next chapter.
4,Predictable but still a great story,The book was predictable in the beginning but still had great character development. Loved the main characters and how much small town charm was a part of the story.
4,Enjoyable,"Ryan is definitely not the bad boy he is made out to be.Negatives about the book: No one will listen to one another. How could no one assume that Isabel could have died in the flood? With absolutely no trace that would be my assumption. There just seemed to be a lot of misplaced anger in the book.Positives: Ryan is extremely loveable! I enjoyed his character and thought he was well developed. Angel is adorable and can really come up with some amazing stories. I enjoyed her imagination and her dedication. Kara was a character that I often wish I was more like. She is very domestic and driven, yet not sure of herself.All-in-all I really did enjoy the book and after the first quarter I was hooked."
5,Loved it,"Mostly believable plot, likable characters. Couldn't put it down.Found this for free on Kindle. i'll be looking for more books by the same author."
4,Sweet love story!,I absolutely loved this book!! It was my first from this author and won't be my last. I loved the characters...full of life and depth!
4,Captivating,"This book was a great first read from this author. It was full of interesting twists, turns, and made it almost impossible to put down. A great read!"
4,Great easy read,This was a good story...not complicated simple plot without too many twists and a great holiday read I enjoyed it
3,Simple and predictable,"It's a sweet and simple story that also happens to be very predictable. If you want an easy read, this is the book for you. There isn't anything wrong with it per se. But if you we're looking for a book with more plot and character development, you will be disappointed."
3,Good,"I am not much on super natural but it played well in this story. I loved Ryan and found myself ""cheering"" for him as I read this book. It was easy to relate to the small town romance. This was a free book & I am glad I read it."
4,Ryan's Return - Good Read,"I read Ryan's Return as a Kindle freebie--the best way to read books these days! Having said that, now that I've read and enjoyed this book, I'll be back to check out Barbara Freethy's other books even at a paid price.Ryan's Return is a great story of love, loss, and family dysfunction. We all have a little bit of dysfunction in our families--Freethy chose to write about it. The main characters, Ryan, Kara, and Andrew, are all fresh and likable with their realistic ups, downs, and flaws.The story has a few different angles, so it keeps you reading. There's the story about the town--which way will things go? The story about the storm--will there be a happy ending? The romance, of course--which guy gets the girl? And finally, the mystery--but I won't spoil it with even a hint!"
4,A true love story,Good read I had a hard time putting it down. You will enjoy this book and wish there was more to the story.
5,WOW!,"good book, it was a fast read for me. if you dont like sad endings, then i wouldn't recommend it!"
3,Ryan's Return,"Good easy read, written easy to follow and enjoy. All around simple and entertaining. Would recommend for a easy read to friends."
3,Good light reading,Easy and good book to take down to the beach and enjoy on a nice day. Good characters to spend time with. Enjoy!
3,Ghostly Love,Storyline was good but love triangle didn't measure up. Suspense of mother's whereabouts was great; keeps the reader's attention. Would recommend to mature adults.
2,Meh.,"This was a freebie, so I can't really complain too much, but I really did not enjoy this story much at all. Honestly there were so many bizarre elements introduced I was almost waiting for an alien abduction or demon possession to creep its way in. There were some decent moments that were cute, but overall I had a hard time getting into it and an even harder time getting past the whole ghost character thing. . ."
3,Ryan's Return,I say it's okay as I haven't read the book yet. How can I give you an honest opinion? Wait.
2,A Poor (Wo)Man's Nicholas Spark,"If you're looking for stories that highlights small town living, you won't really find it in this book.If you're looking for a romance novel, you won't really find it in this book.If you're looking for memorable characters, you won't really find it in this book.If you're looking for a good mystery you... kind of find it in this book.I will give the author credit, I like how she slowly reveals the 'mystery"" of what happened to Ryan. The pacing is the only thing that kept me reading towards the end. However, the closer we get to discovering the past the less you start to care and the author just kind of rushes the ending and slaps a happy ending with little thought."
1,Just couldn't get into the story...,I just could not get into the story. It was so predictable and cheesy at times. I love a good romance story but this was so far out of reality with brothers and their relationships with women. I love other Barbara Freethy books but just not a fan of this one. Hate that I spent 2.99 on it.
1,Terrible,"Sorry, but this book was very stupid! The characters went back and forth with their feelings and were so wishy washy. They have feelings for one another in one chapter and in the next they are packing their bags to leave. Predictable plot and cheesy dialog. I read it to the end because I wanted to confirm who the ghost was, but sorry now that I wasted my time. Pass on this one."
4,Ryan's Return,"Easy read and the book keeps you interested. I would recommend it to a friend, and read more from this author."
4,Ryans Return,Enjoyed the book every page. I guess the thing that kept my interest is that it paralleled my life. Angel definitely was a good character and kept the interest alive.
3,Worth reading,"I think the plot was good and the characters were developed well. This book does not stand out from many that I have read, but I would read others by this author."
4,Ryan's return,"I really enjoyed the story line. Romance, suspense, & supernatural. I laughed, cried, and felt like I was right there. Would definitely read again."
4,Ryan's return,It was different! I get tired of the same old stories and I had not read anything like it for a while.
5,An orgy of pictures and information,"This book is a bargain. From recipes to historical anecdotes this book is a blessing. Everything you wanted to know and see about Spain's gastronomical heritage. The pictures are beautiful and large. The perfect coffee and kitchen table book. It makes any other country jealous. There's ham, wine, brandy, cigars, fruit, seafood, etc. This is a great book to give anyone interested in Spain. As a fellow proud Spaniard I certainly enjoyed it and it is one of the best reference visual books in my collection."
2,Light and Cheap Feeling,"At 34"" around I just didn't feel like I was getting the support I needed. It feels like a cheaper bra and won't even stay flat against my ribs because it doesn't seem to fit right (I recently just got a measurement done, so I know what size I should be wearing. To be fair, bras are all different and ordering online is difficult without being able to try them on. I would not buy this again and I won't be wearing mine."
2,Foreman Grill GR26TMR,"After reading good reviews on this grill, I bought it because it seemed like just what I was looking for. I was tired of cleaning my range hood frequently because of grilling meat in a large cast iron skillet. The good: The Foreman grill is easy to clean and does not smoke. The bad: the meat does not taste as good. The grill does not get as hot as the skillet. Therefore, it is not very useful to me because cleanup alone does not a good product make."
4,Very Nice,"I have been wanting one of these weather stations for a while and ran across this one on amazon on sale. I have had it nbow for several weeks. For the money it cannot be beat and has a lot of nice features. The atomic clock connects to the staton pretty strongly and I live in Baltimore! It was easy to setup. The outdoor sensor linked right up to my main station. It is pretty acurate on forcasting the weather, what it forcasts usually happens 9 out of 10 times. I did not go wrong purchasing this itemm and you probaly won't either!"
5,Excellent Product At A Great Price,"I started to buy a similar weather at a local Target store about 25 miles away but this one was a better deal. I've had it about a week and am amazed at how well it works. The atomic clock is extremely accurate! I checked it against a standard time and would you believe that it is good down to a second or less! Also the outdoor temperature tracks right with our local Weather Channel readings. Also the humidity readings are good. Another good feature is the button on top for lighted display-in the middle of the night-press the button and read display and it goes out in about five seconds. Hey, I'm going to order another for gift giving!"
4,beautiful yet not too functional for me,"i live in el salvador central america and i cannot use the weather forecaster because they say that if you are relatively near the equator barometic pressure changes are not too significant to accurately make a forecast this suposedly happens from the southern part of mexico down to peru, and i cant use the atomic clock function because im just too far from denver, but at least i can use the wireless thermometer function and im pretty happy with it im in the third floor of my house and the signal is still comming up"
4,Nice Product,"The temperature and the clock is quite accurate. But the weather forecast is not. I would still recommend this product, which is great in this price."
1,Does not work as the description say it does.,"Says that the time function automatically synchronizes with the US Atomic Clock, providing accurate timekeeping that never needs adjustment--even for Daylight Savings Time however you must be a certain distance from Denver where the clock is. If not (like me) it's a useless feature. While the transmitter for my unit was only 50 feet from the main unit it constantly lost the signal. I returned my first unit thinking it might have been defective; the second unit was the same. That went back also. 100 foot range is a bunch of bunk! I would not recommend this item."
1,Laughable.,"This tribute is more like something out of Saturday Night Live. The vocalist on these tracks, simply put, CANNOT SING. She's worse than Britney.And Amazon's tracklisting is wrong. It's actually a two-CD collection. The actual tracks are as follows:Disc One:1. Oops! I Did It Again2. Stronger3. Satisfaction, (I Can't Get No)4. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know5. What U See Is What U Get6. Lucky7. One Kiss From You8. Can't Make Me Love You9. Dear Diary10. Baby One More Time11. Born To Make You Happy12. Crazy, (You Drive Me)13. Sometimes14. From The Bottom Of My Broken HeartDisc Two:1. You Got It All2. Beat Goes On3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door4. I Will Be There5. When Your Eyes Say It6. Girl In The Mirror7. I'm A Slave 4 U8. Overprotected9. Lonely10. Cinderella11. What It's Like To Be Me12. E-Mail My HeartIf you must torture yourself, samples to ALL the tracks are available at CDUniverse."
1,WTF ??,What is this crap? Seriously? Is this even legal? And how is this a tribute? It is unbelievable to me that some music industry decided to put this out on cd!
4,Decent Can Opener - So Far ...,"We've only used it a few times, but it seems to work well and does look nice. Only hitch so far is it took a few tries to get a larger can to hook in to open, but once it did action was smooth and thorough."
4,"Sleek, Modern and It Works","Initially I thought that I'd made a huge mistake. I'd read the instructions yet I could not figure out how to open the can. Once I realized what my error was, use became a breeze. I've very happy with it. Love the design of it. It's small enough that it doesn't take up much counter space yet big enough to get noticed. So far I am very pleased with it."
2,engineered fail,"I had this about two years when a little plastic piece approximately behind the blade broke and the opener won't ""turn on"". Light use, power good, motor good, engineered fail."
5,great can opener,"Bought this for the wife. She never has really liked an electric can opener, always said they didn't work right or was to aggravating to use. Decided after reading the reviews to give this a try. She loves it, easy to use and well built. Leaves a really clean cut edge."
3,It's only OK.,"Although it opens cans OK, it usually strips off a small amount of the paper label during the process. It is also sometimes difficult to attach the can to the opener."
3,Hoped it would be easier to use....,Bought this because I have problems with manual can openers as I have fibromyalgia and mild arthritis. Read many reviews and this seemed best. Works great as long as you can get the lip of the can high enough for it to touch the blade - a little tricky and annoying but it works once you get the hang of it. It's bigger than I expected but does taller cans. Has a replaceable blade which I guess no other brand offers.
4,The best opener I've ever had.,I have had so many can openers in my life. This one finally works the way you'd want it to. It is very easy to operate.
1,So disappointed,"This product has not performed satisfactorily. First it was ""sensitive"" and the can had to be just so in order to successfully adhere and open. Now, it just won't work at all. Have only owned it since October. My hands are quite arthritic and I had high hopes for this. It was not cheap either."
2,Minority DUD,Perhaps I am one of a few unlucky owners. Mine has never been easy to operate and it has gotten worse. When I lift the lever to put the can under the magnetic lid catcher does not lift so I have to push it with my finger until the can is under. When running the opener runs a little then gets kinda stuck a second or two then progresses a little and gets stuck again. Eventually it opens the can but often misses the lid which falls on the counter. Perhaps there is a small alignment problem with the cutter or lever that closes on the can edge. Fortunately it is cheap. Glad for all the happy owners but I am not one of them.
5,west bend red electric can opener 77204,I am very happy with this can opener. I love the red. It is very quiet and does a great job. The entire chrome faceplate comes off for easy cleaning. I would highly recommend this opener.
4,Nice Look,"Needed a stainless steel can opener to go along with all our new stainless steel appliances, but did not want to spend alot of money. After shopping around, I decided on this one. It has worked like a charm & looks wonderful with my new kitchen, without spending alot of $$. Very satisfied."
4,A Can Opener that Opens Cans!,Well made opener. Have not run across a can it would not open - yet!They could have designed the lever to start the can opener better. It has an edge to it (not sharp edge) so you push on an edge instead of a more ergonomic flat surface.Very pleased so far - I have never had an electric opener I have liked - this one I like!
5,GREAT BUY,CAN OPENER IS GREAT.HAS ALL THE FEATUERS YOU NEED AND SIMPLE TO USE.EASY TO USE AND IS A NO HASSLE PRODUCT
1,Broke after two months,This can opener looked great and worked great for about two months. Then the screw that turns the drive wheel (the one that turns the can) striped its threads. I'm looking for another can opener manufacturer now.
5,Excellent Product,"The West Bend electric coffee grinder was the perfect gift for the guy who has everything and loves electronic gadgets! Along with 5 samples of coffee beans, the birthday gift was a hit. The metallic choice was perfect for a kitchen full of stainless steel applicances."
1,Westbend broke after 7 months of very light use.,"I am upset. The circular cutting wheel and washers fell off the main shaft, making this now useless! We barely used it, perhaps opening about 3-4 cans a week over 7 months. And I bought this only because I read so many great reviews--that said, did we get the one lemon in the batch? At $25, I expect more than 7 months of use--and I see the price is now up to $33. If anyone has a suggestion as to whether parts are available, kindly respond. This is very disappointing."
5,great can opener,"I read all the reviews and was a little concerned with this can opener, but ordered it anyway. My wife says its the best can opener she has ever used, PERIOD! We threw our all metal $50 Crisinart in the trash as it still had plastic parts that broke and would drip all over the counter when she used it."
3,It's ok,It's a normal electric can opener... No particular conditions about the product to review... looks perfect in your kitchen if you have metalic kitchen products/machines...
1,Pile of Junk,"This can opener is a total pile of junk. It failed the first can I tried to open, a #10, large can of tuna from Sam's. Pretty pathetic for a $40+ can opener. An $8 Swing-A-Way can do better than that!"
4,Works good.,"So far so good, cuts well, fairly quick, has a bit of a problem initially grasping on to the can lid like so many openers, sometimes I get it the first try, sometimes 3 tries."
5,"I am ""in love"" with this product!","What a joy to have a electric can opener that works! My last was a Proctor Silex, and after minimal usage, just stopped working. Not that it ever worked that well. The handle would fall off easily, and toward the end, would never cut open all the way around the top. This West Bend opener is the complete opposite. I was used to having to stand and help it along. This one just goes as smooth as can be, and easy to place can. I can walk away! Only problem is that it shreds the paper sometimes on the can, but I can live with it. Absolutely would recommend this can opener!!!"
3,It's just a can opener.,"This product has received an average amount of use (3-4 times a week) and it's held up okay. I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it's certainly not a piece of junk. If you can find one look for one that cuts without the razor sharp edge and has good reviews. That's been our favorite style to date. This one does the old sharp edge cut. In that category it's adequate. Go ahead and get it. You won't be disappointed."
3,Great can opener and unfortunately a great label peeler.,"Great can opener...I looked at all the reviews before I purchased. It opens can as it should, however it has peeled off parts of every label on every can I have ever used it on. Label peelings on my countertops,floors and twice I found bits of label in my food. I'm keeping it because I'm too busy to bother sending it back, but I cannot say that I am happy with this product."
2,Greatest Fly Tying Book,I have 4 tying books and have been interested in tying for years but as soon as I recieved this book I became addicted.I also have the CD-Rom of the same title and both are more helpful than any information I have gotten anywhere else.If you want to help someone start tying flies or already know how and just want to get better this is a must buy.The CD-Rom also has movies on every technique you would ever possibly need. Buy this book!!!!!
1,brain dead crittics,"ANY time you bleep out the punch line, its bleepen stupid. wait for the bleepen crittics to take their head out of a very dark place"
3,Mac Lays down the law for Cash Money,"Mac's second solo album World War III was not as good as Shell Shocked and probably wasn't one of No Limits top 5 cd's this year, the song ""We Deadly"" featuring Master P is warning Cash Money to step off before something bad happens, I'm the biggest No Limit fan there is and I buy every No Limit album but Mac's production team can't touch former No Limit crew Beats by the Pound, No Limit 2000, pick up ""Only God can Judge Me"" from the Last Don"
5,This album is tha BOMB,"This Album is one of tha best No Limit had to offer this year.It has some bomb-ass beats and also some cool additionnal rappers like(D.I.G,Popeye...)"
4,"Nice film, well-done.","Slow in unfolding, Crimson Gold is nevertheless compelling, the very stuff classic film is made of.I first saw this film at a Middle Eastern film festival, despite the fact that Iran isn't actually a Middle Eastern country (though it is predominantly Islamic in faith).At any rate, the tale involves two crooks who basically have good hearts, and their struggle against the class system, and, more specifically, their low status.The film is effective in presenting the religious and political climate, but also the despair that could drive a person into doing something desperate. I'm trying to NOT spoil the film for you, just in case you couldn't tell.I took one star away from this film because only the best-best-BEST films on earth should get a five. Nonetheless, I'm sure you'll like this film inshallah! :)"
2,Battery for my HP Tablet,"I purchased this for my Daughter's HP Tablet. When I put the battery in, it showed a 50% charge. I then charged it overnight and it would only go to 78%. After a few days it started dropping the total charge percent until it would not hold a charge at all. I promptly returned for a refund. I purchased another battery from another vendor."
5,Don't Bother Reading If You Don't Have A Sense Of Humor,"I read this book years and years ago when it was first released. Part of the series that begins with The Probability Broach, The Venus Belt displays Smith's ability to truly extend his imagination...not so much in a science fiction way (because the new technology in this book is minimal and mostly ancillary), but because he opens up even more to display his own sense of life, and it's a very brazen and brash sense!I actually like Walter Cronkite, and yes the antagonist is Cronkite-esque, but that is about the only real similarity. If you have liberal sensitivities, don't let that stop you from reading it. Just put the political attitudes aside and enjoy the insanity."
5,Corb and Loos,"An excellent book! Very well documented with plans, sections, elevations and models. The models are especially informative because they are primarily section models that illustrate the spatial differences between Corb and Loos. The book also dispell the misconception that Corb's houses were white. The original color schemes of the various houses are displayed in the models. A great book for students of theses two giants."
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money,I cannot believe I actually paid anything for this article. It contained nothing helpful at any level.
3,Glosses over big points,This book was ok. Enough to keep me interested and finish reading it. But the end was so choppy and quick. It was like the author took so much time building up to the plot and only the last chapter gives us any resolution. And not that I would even call it resolution. I'd like to see some much deserved justice in the book and that did not come at all.A decent read and I can't complain since I only paid .99 cent for it!
4,Designing woman,"Designer Keely Murdock has every right to throw a ""hissy fit"". As a young girl her mother deserted her and on the eve of her wedding she finds her fiance in a very compromising position. As her friend says, Keely as ""abandonment issues"". She also has a shrinking paycheck when her former fiance's family begins to sabotage her decorating jobs. She and her aunt are finally thrown a lifeline when Will Mahoney, a new entrepreneur in town, decides to refurbish an old plantation house into a real show place. Keely enthusiastically tackles her new project, but she encounters a few problems along the way, such as an impossible deadline and Will's haughty girlfriend. This book is full of laughs and southern charm and is a light and entertaining read."
2,my name is boring,This book could have been summed up in half the pages that he took to draw it out. maybe you had to be turkish to truley understand and appreciate the message in this book.
1,There may be a good novel in there,".. but I could not find it.I love mysteries and foreign lands, picked up 'My Name Is Red', by Orhan Pamuk, translated from the Turkish. Set in Istanbul around 1600AD, it's a murder mystery-romance in which unfortunately any sympathy for any of the main characters is slowly eroded to where I didn't care if the murderer gets caught nor if the lovers get together. Kind of gritted my teeth to finish it. But I know more about the inner workings of the Islamic miniaturist painter's life than I ever wanted.It's too bad that the translator didn't provide some badly needed editing. Like a storyteller in love with his own voice, Orhan Pamuk simply doesn't know when to shut up. I plowed through seemingly endless chapters written from not only the main character's viewpoints, but from a dog and Satan.This novel could have shed about 1/3 its bulk and been a much more satisfying read.NOT recommended unless you have the patience of a saint.Karl Moeller somewhere in the desert"
2,Very knowlegable but Boring,"This was the first novel by Pamuk I read and sadly must admit that 70 pages before the end I gave up unable to read one more page - the book had defeated me.The subject of this novel was the reason I wanted to read it in the first place, because I am very interested in Islamic Culture and Art. Pamuk is obviously an expert on Miniature painting and the information he gives is very interesting, and I learned a lot from it, but it is too repetitive. His passion for the subject probaly run away with him and blinded him to the fact that he was also writing a murder- mystery and not a scholarly dissertation. I feel very stupid reading all these glorious reviews but the fact is ,that admitting he is an excellent writer, the book was too long-drawn. I will certainly try one of his other novels in the near future and hope that this time I will hit the Jackpot."
5,Incantory Poet,"Bravo! Gerard Wozek joins hands with mystic poets Rumi, Whitman, and Rimbaud in his celebration of the body electric. Despite his earthy references (sometimes more confessional than confidential) to carnality, there is a desire in Wozek's poems to move towards beauty and transcendence. Featured at the Lambda Literary Festival 2001, this slim volume presents lyrical snapshots of the poet divining what is most sacred at both emotional and sexual crossroads. A noteworthy debut!"
1,A piece of junk!,What a waste of [...]! Might as well have gone to the driving range for a month. This device only lasted me a couple of days. Purchased it yesterday and used it a little. Used it this evening and destroyed the darn thing. The posts came right out of the cheap particle board after I hit the ball and string at the same time. Don't waste your money!!!SWING GROOVER
1,"NICE IDEA, BUT JUNK","No bolts to mount to the fiber board. First and I mean the very first swing, the simulated golf ball split into 4 pieces and flew all over my garage. Don't buy, there has to be a better product out there."
2,Disapointed but willing to compromise,"Yes, it's too bad: this should have been a fantastic set.Never having seen Chaplin's earliest works, being a fan sincemy pre-teens, I was excited by the potential of these DVD's.Now, I'm no film historian or expert, but... I was immediatelystruck by the poor quality of the images, the fact that actors'heads were chopped off, the framing obviously out of whack,and what's with the godawful music? I like to think that anyonecapable of putting together such an ambitious project would want to take the care to do it justice. Alas... This seems to havethrown together for capital gain, lacking much sense of artisticintegrity. Ick.(Note: I've only seen the first two DVD's so far... I hear things get better later on.)"
2,Delta fell down on this one,"Purchased the X5 for the long table and that it was a Delta. The table has sharp corners not rounded. Beware of the fence where it is beveled - it is as sharp as a razor. I filed it down after loosing skin off two knuckles. It took forever to find a location to drill holes for mounting a power feed unit without hitting bracing under the table. I would have preferred the reversing swicth located on the outside of the base. Even hooked to a dust collector shavings build up in the base - which happens with all shapers. Unfortunately there is no lower clean out door. To remove shavings you must reach in and remove from top. To use the miter slot the entire fence assembly must be rotated. The micro adjustment of the fence is a nice touch, but had to tape the adjusting knobs to keep from moving due to vibration.The X5 performs well and is well made. It is just very poorly engineered."
5,Babylon America,"This series by Beth Moore is life-changing. Since taking it I am so aware of how far we have fallen in our society. America needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Beth talks about this attitude we have of ""Its all about me"". She is very well-knowledged in explaining the prophecy of Daniel. She combines her bible knowledge with her own special humor. Its a great series."
5,Best Bible study done in a long time,"Beth Moore digs in deep with this Bible study. You work hard, but at the end oh what you have learned. A great series to do in a group. We had a 12 week women's Bible study that went through this series. Definitely worth it to purchase the DVD's to go with it. Such insight she provides in them. A great study!"
5,Excellent Workbook for Understanding the Book of Daniel,"Beth Moore has written an EXCELLENT study/experience of the book of Daniel! For best effect, you'll want to purchase and watch her video series as you work your way through this Bible study. I read her book after completing my own book,Future History: Understanding the Book of Daniel and End Times Prophecy, and wished I had read her volume as part of my research. Beth has a clear writing style and a personal manner of connecting with women. I highly recommend this book."
2,Another attempt to replicate Catcher fails,"Alright, I gave this book a chance. I read it 'til the end and while I admit some of the writing is damn good, Cirino needs to get his own ideas and stop replicating Salinger. In many of the sections I Just rolled my eyes, the plot was so parallel, Sam's whining and complaints were too pathetically familiar to Holden's. Cirino is still young and I suspect he can do better than this... I'd be interested in seeing more work from him after he's cut the all too obvious plagarizing."
1,Not worth it,"Lasted through approximately five weeks of shredding my daily junk mail before the motor burned out. Granted I get a lot of junk mail, but I expected more from a name brand."
5,A VERY COOL & GREAT SOUNDING CD PLAYER.,"I had been wanting to get a CD player in the kitchen so that I could listen to my favorite CD's while preparing meals, etc. Well, this little CD player looks so cute on my counter!! And when I looked at that little speaker, I thought it would probably sound like a squawk box. But it sounds great! And it has a remote control!! I just LOVE this CD player and AM/FM radio. I just got this yesterday, but I think I'll get another one for my sister-in-law for her birthday, 'cause I KNOW she'll want one when she sees mine. If you're in the market for an AM/FM radio with a CD player, this could very well be the one for you. It DOES have a sleep function, but it doesn't have an alarm."
4,Heartfelt,"I came back to this recording just the other day. Whereas the style is pretty similar from song to song, you can not deny the tuching lyrics that Mr. Mellancamp wrote on this piece of work. A real tribute to the working class mid western people of the USA. Some nice little special effects add to such tracks like ROCK In The USA and Justice and Independence. Very appropriate for most rock audiences especially those who like Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Charlie Daniels, and U2."
4,I think it works,"Since this is a preventative device, I cannot report an immediate noticeable improvement in anything (which would justify the fifth star). However, these are being used b/c of my audiologist's recommendation, largely because I exercise and sweat and that moisture is more than likely shortening the life of my hearing aids. At about $2000/ear, using the desiccant in the ""Dry & Store"" seems like a reasonable price to pay in order to extend the life of my precious electronics and lessen my stress level (which gets elevated when my hearing aids are out for repairs or otherwise out of commission and everyone's speech sounds like Charley Brown's teacher),"
5,Dry and Store is Audiologist recommended,"I have been using Dry n Store for 4 years, always with these Dry-Brik blocks.My audiologist strongly recommended this system to protect my very expensive hearing aids. The Dry-Brik Blocks work perfectly with the unit. Be aware that the timing stripe on the package in no way represents the actual desiccant condition in the block. It is nothing more than a timing device that starts running as soon as the seal is broken, even if the block remains in a sealed container.I have a humidity controlled home, so I leave each block in the unit for three months rather than the recommended two. No problems."
3,Chi-Town's lesser-known artists shine,"This album showcases some of the Chi's hidden talent, with mixed results. There are some bright spots--Quarta Ounce lead the pack with a hot track, along with nice efforts from D. Villa and Triple Darkness. But a lot of this album is filled with mediocre tracks, which is what would be expected on a compilation of this sort.The album would've benefitted highly with a few contributions from Chi's big names, mainly Crucial Conflict, Do Or Die, and Psychodrama. And while Newsense from Psychodrama does appear on two tracks, it's just not the same without SideKic and the HIGHLY underrated Yung Buck.They made one good choice on here though, the inclusion of Twista's hard to find Suicide, a dope track on which he disses Naughty By Nature, among others.Overall, if you're a fan of Chi-Town rap and want to become acquainted with some of their lesser known talent, this would be a recommended buy."
1,junk wiring,"Simple, inside the headphone, where the wiring is spliced to the headset speakers and mike, is about the smallest wire I've ever seen in my life. I doubt there is a wiring number for wire this tiny. And, it breaks!! Others have reported the same thing. It'll work until it breaks. There is no ""strain relief"" on the wiring cable leading inside. So, a slight tug would bust it to heck and gone. I am REALLY REALLY NOT HAPPY here. It is not user repairable and I am really loathe to own something I cannot get a soldering iron to, that involves elementary wiring. I just don't see the reasoning for using such small wiring as there is enough room inside the headset for a decent wiring bundle. There is cheap and there is CHEAP! I doubt anyone from Logitech can explain why they made a perfectly good product so cheesy. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product. Good Lord! I am so angry at this.Logitech Premium USB Headset 350 ( 980374-0403 )"
3,Very uncomfortable but technically great,"CONS:This has got to be one of the most torturous headsets i have ever worn. Anything past 30 minutes is just a matter of how much pain you can take. I cant see how anyone but a kid would be able to wear this headset comfortably.PROS:Good quality sound and microphone, very easy setup (plug and play, no driver), totally compatible, no problems at all.CONCLUSION:Probably the best USB headset on the (home user) market and probably the most uncomfortable one as well."
2,It was great till the volume piece fell apart!,"I really loved these headphones, quite comfortable, but the volume dongle in the middle of the cord fell apart on me; it is a point of failure, and once it is damaged your headset is useless. I am looking for a headset that won't break as easily."
1,Garbage,Lightly used for a year and the screw fell out with no way to fix. I don't mishandle my electronic products but this one was a lemon. never again!
2,"Great, but hell to wear","OK, Logitech makes great products...with at least this particular exception. Granted, these are almost as comfortable as the headset which comes with Dragon Naturally speaking, but that headset is worth perhaps $7.00. Nice sound, but they are the least comfortable thing I have ever purchased."
4,Great Quality Headset,"I had to purchase this after buying another logitech headset (not USB) after finding out my power mac g5 did not have powered audio jacks, meaning the standard mic mini-plug headsets won't work. The usb headset worked like a charm. Audio quality and clarity leaves something to be desired, but that's why I have a pair of studio quality cans. Mic quality is excellent. My only reason for not giving this 5 stars was, for me, (a proud wearer of glasses) I found it uncomfortable and at times painful to wear the headset for extended periods (2+ hours)."
1,Mic has alot of static,Using this Mic with Teamspeak caused alot of static and was irritating to the people I was talking to. The sound quality of the earphones was great. I could hear left and right channel excellent.
1,Worst headset in the world.,"I bought this for $40. It was most waste of money I could have ever imagined.An internal component broke within a month. The left ear was inaudible.The microphone was nonadjustable.It was way too tight and it hurt so much. It was ridiculous. Might as well buy a pair of speakers, glue them to a hat, and rip the microphone from a laptop. That would have even been better.The headset does not conform around the hears.It's flat.My friend who had one also described it as: ""Putting your head in a vice""The sound was great, but it was so uncomfortable.I don't think anyone could wear it well.I'm being generous.Get the Koss SB-45. It's dirt cheap, comfortable, and the sound's clear. The microphone on SB-45 is good too."
5,Great product - great price!,"This headset fits very well, is very comfortable and required no setup at all - just plug it in and go. I use it with Skype and all you need to do is set your Skype sound preferences to use the USB headset. Overall the quality is first rate.For MacBook Pro users, I had to return a different headset that used separate headphone and mic plugs because the MacBook Pro does NOT have a regular mic input - it has a line-in which does not work with standard 3.5mm mic plugs."
3,Works great...for a few months,"I have had two pairs of these and they both met the same fate. Due to the way the cable is designed, it eventually loses connection to one or both of the speakers. I have looked inside, and the wires are still connected, so it must be a defect in the cable.While they worked the sound was good, the volume control was easy to use and controlled the volume in any application you are using. However, the short life of these headphones means you are better off buying better."
2,Not as good as the 250,"I bought a Logitech 250 to replace my Ipevo USB Skype phone and it was a great improvement. Others said my voice was much louder and clearer, and a problem I had been having with my voice suddenly getting too quiet for others to hear went away right away. So I recommended the 250 to a friend, but the store he went to was out of them so he got a 350. He's very frustrated, as the mute button on the headphones is very sensitive and very easy to trigger, which happens regularly during our conversations. He's anxious to get rid of it and get the 250 as soon as possible. The 250 is quite comfortable and works superbly for me, by the way. For Skyping, at least, the volume control of the 350 is useless, as is the mute button, since one can hit Mute on the screen at any time."
3,"Functional and well priced, but not the most comfortable.","I am using the headset both for music and chat. The sound quality is good, the ear pieces fit snug and block an acceptable amount of background noise, and the microphone is sensitive enough for my purposes, but the hard plastic unpadded headband becomes uncomfortable after about an hour. Given the price I paid, I am satisfied with my purchase, but wouldn't recommend the item for high quality sound or extended periods of use."
2,Thin cable above the in-line control,"Cable goes thin after the in-line control, and this limits life. The H530 has no in-line control and the cable runs thick all the way to the headset, a much better design all round."
3,"works fine with windows xp, but cannot get this to work with Vista","The logitech headset 350 works very nicely with my windows xp, but when I try to get it to work on Vista, it sees it, but cannot pass the speech recognition test. Also, I don't hear anything through the speakers. (I am attempting to use this with my Rosetta Stone software.) When I checked on control panel for the sound levels, it said it was working fine. It was just muted and the volume controls slid down to nothing (which is odd because I have been using my headset that came with the Rosetta Stone daily, with no problems) I unchecked the mute and slid the bars up, but it still wouldn't work. The seller even sent me a new pair, but it does the same thing. I have searched for solutions through both microsoft and logitech websites, but have found none. (a google search found that others are having similar problems, without solution) If anyone has a solution, please let me know. Good Luck!"
3,Prone to malfunction,"I have had 2 of these headsets, both if which have malfunctioned after a few months of use. I really like the headset itself, it offers a great microphone and good sound quality, but it tends to break rather easily. Both of mine had the same issue, which is loss of sound from one the the ears, due to a loose connection in the in-line volume control."
5,great sound quality,I use this with Skype and most people I talk to can't tell the difference between this and a regular phone. The ability to mute right on the headset is a definite plus also.
1,"Garbage, should cost 5 bucks","I bought a pair of these to use for playing games with friends n family. They are terrible.* Makes my ears sweat and hurt after 5 minutes. The cheap plastic foam is hard and provides no ventilation. Uncomfortable.* Volume control dial is cheap, causes all sound to disappear from one ear. Slightly moving the wire will cause sound to get knocked out of one ear. Pain in the butt to use.* Plastic connector hurts after a while - no cushioning.Basically, this headset sucks. Look elsewhere."
3,Quality sound in an uncomfortable headset,"Uncomforable headset, if you hold it against your ears, for more than twenty minutes.I wish, it had a switch, unabling or disabling the computer speakers, instead of the headset, but allowing intermitent use of the microphone only."
1,"Poor design, will ultimately stop working","When I bought these, I saw how the big cord goes to the USB adapter and then the thinner cord goes from the mute adapter (the round thing you see in the middle of the cable) to the headset. My first reaction was, wow this thin cord is really flimsy and the connection looks prone to failing. Sure enough, 6 mos later or constant but careful use, that thin cable has started to come loose from the mute adapter and now its unusable as i get constant static. A shame as other wise a fantastic set of gaming / voip headphones but do NOT buy these."
2,Too bad I can't wear them,"The audio quality is good; crisp highs and decent lows. The microphone is fine. I really like the volume control and the mute button with LED indicator.However, the ear cups are more like two circular planks. The ridges on my ear push up against the hard inner speaker...I can't wear these things for longer than an hour without pain. You can actually see the imprint my ear leaves on the foam. And as for the cushion? It's more like a stiff plastic ring.I recommend the Logitech 250 instead for better comfort. You may compromise a bit of the sound quality as compared to the 350, but it does the job!"
4,Second One,"I owned one and really like it ,the problem was friends and family would take it from my room to use it for themselves ,so I had to buy another one again for me. I am happy with this product. Its seem confortable so far. Good sound and I also like the look , I say great design. In the future I might have to buy two more"
1,Fragile and uncomfortable,This is my second and last pair. They only last one year until the fragile cord breaks. They are also very uncomfortable after wearing for about an hour.
2,Discomfort and headache,"I use this headset for dictation software (Dragon NS) today. Yikes. My head is splitting from the tight grip this headset has, and I have a not-so-big head :-( Headache building for sure. Additionally, the headset is heavy.The sound quality is ok, not a big improvement over the usb Labtech 712 which was way more comfortable for me to wear. I thought I would get some sound accuracy improvement by paying more money but it is not necessarily the case here. Too bad the Labtec's mic is a bit broken (due to misuse) and Logitech bought out Labtec.Bought it with a rebate so ended up costing around $25. Probably will end up giving it away.2-star because it works, it is just hard to keep on one's head, that's all."
1,"Nice features, good sound, VERY uncomfortable","I was excited when I first received this as it sounds great and the mute/volume button is easy to access. However, they are VERY uncomfortable on my ears after even a few minutes of use, leaving them physically sore. I would not recommend them."
3,"Excellent overall sound quality, but too uncomfortable for regular use.","As my title suggests, this headset produces excellent sound, and has a good microphone. My problem is that it is terribly uncomfortable. I have a big head, but that's not even the problem. The problem is, the ear cushions are very firm, and feel somewhat rubberized. Basically, they are not soft in any way. My friend who reviews USB-based products recommends this headset for its sound quality, but to me, the discomfort greatly outweighs the superior sound production. He lent me this set, and it's a good thing he did, otherwise I'd have made the mistake of buying it."
1,My last time buying logictech,I had bought this headset about two-three months ago and about a amonth ago I had noticed that the cord was starting to twist its self inside the cord casing. Eventually it ended up twisting so much that casing had broken open and eventually the wires to the mic snapped. This is the second head set from logictech that I have owned that have done nearly the exact same thing. When I had first noticed the cord twisting I would hold it an let it on wind but that only kept the headset alive for a little while longer.
3,disappointed,Was expecting something more heavy duty.. will not hang a $5000 camera on this.. will find a use for it. maybe for one of my little digitals.
3,Nostalgia DVD,"Arrived quicker than expected. DVD could have been longer - espcially considering how much Shirley Jones has achieved, but hampered by the format of the show. Worth watching."
2,Without any real purpose...,"This CD isn't bad at all. It's well played, well produced and every song sounds EXACTLY the same. Oh boy!Seriously, this CD is a delete bin affair of the worst kind. The performances are top notch and the songs are boring as hell. After three listens I simply forgot every song as it left. Blindingly fast, blindingly without purpose.These musicians obviously have talent, and from time to time this CD makes perfect sense with some catchly melodies or lyrics. But seriously...it's something that history won't bother to remember. It's pandering to their audience which is good I geuss, but those of us on the outside will find nothing new or even fun to look into."
3,Decent but not essential,"I never did hear any of Ian Gillan's solo stuff when it originally came out,I totally missed that whole period.Since,i've been very intrigued as to what these solo releases sound like - I am a huge Gillan fan from his early Deep Purple days(as im sure the majority are that are reading this review).Ive read elsewhere that this period of his can be considered part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal scene occuring during the late 70's/early 80's.Well Metal this aint.Deep Purple it aint,either.Hard Rock kinda along the lines of Purples later ""Perfect Strangers"" album,though not as good as that release by any means.Not to say this isnt decent,because it is - it is a solid three star album.Nothing really stands out though.If you are hankering to hear Ian's soaring falsetto,you'll be quite disappointed.No,as mentioned previously,this is Hard Rock played competently if not particularly inspired."
5,Printable DVD's are great. I wouldn't use anything else.,Memorex DVD+R 16x 4.7GB 100 Pack Spindle PrintablePrintable dvd's are a must have for those who want a nice label without damaging the dvd. This is a top quality product. I always keep a supply on hand.
5,Poignant and Sad,"The author skillfully holds the reader's attention as he weaves his tale. Set in the culture of Old World Austria, where Hitler had also spent his formative years absorbing its virulent anti-Semitism, the story is poignant and sad."
2,Sub-standard VHS quality on a DVD,"Film is witty, charming, and fun. Nice to watch Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in their happier days (they hated each other later in Wuthering Heights), but this rating is not for the film itself, it's a rating on the DVD quality only. This is basically a VHS transfer to a DVD. Gritty quality and faded colors. If you get the chance to catch the oh-so-much-nicer Turner Classic Movies showing of the film, you'll see a big difference. If the TCM version was on the DVD, then easily 5 stars. This DVD only gets a generous 2 stars (1 star because it's on DVD and 1 more because I've seen worse)."
5,Excellent !!,"It is just excellent. Perticularly hunting scenes taken from Kanha and Bhandhavghad are thrilling. Photography is very good also content is nice. It covers a life cycle of a Tiger, which is very important."
4,"Tiger, tiger, burning bright . . ..","If you love tigers, you'll love this film. It is all about the beautiful, rarely seen tiger. The film is full of basic tiger facts, but anyone who has done any tiger research will not learn anything new. Though I didn't learn anything new about tigers, I still enjoyed watching these powerful, graceful animals."
3,So so movie... cool bluray,"This is the sequel to Night Watch. Movie is ok. If you are really bored, then watching this movie would be awesome. Since I wasn't so bored, it was just okay. The only reason I bought this movie was because Hollywood movies are getting lousy. Anyway, this movie is way better than most hollywood movies these days. I would go as far as saying it's better than the previous James Bond movie (I consider JB a hollywood movie)."
1,"CACOPHONOUS CONFUSION, NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR","Throw every device, every melodramatic, hysteric trick of CGI and acting and that is this probably vodka-powered train wreck. It makes NIGHT WATCH, the first of this two-part series, almost Disney-esque."
4,This movie lost a lot of the,"realistic grittiness of the first one, The Night Watch, but it is obvious they had more money to play around with and spent it on better sets and special effects.I enjoyed the movie, as much as I did the first. The special effects were fine, the acting first rate and the plot excellent. Don't expect a hollywood blockbuster or world famous actors. Accept it as it is. A good fantasy film. And watch the Night Watch first. Otherwise it doesn't make sense."
4,"Nice Phone, Nice Service","Got the item on time as the description on the website. Brand new phone, very friendly customer service,on time delivery.The only thing that I did not rate it as five stars is the price is a little bit higher than other websites. But I still would like to put more money to get the best product, especially the cell phone.Some websites said they sell the brand new cell phone, but actually when you receive the item, you will often find broken package,used item inside. I was cheated one time before, at last I still choose Amazon to purchase the rare elecronics.Anyway, Amazon is a good website you can trust."
3,Sony Ericsson,"I ordered a blue colored phone but I received a black one instead. The phone works very well, I like it. But I still prefer a blue one."
4,the MUSIC'S the thing!!!!,"Okay,, the subject matter is ""controversial"".So what ? The music's the thing. Hard , heavy , very entertaining. Take the lyrics for one person's thoughts / opinions and ENJOY the quality of the musicianship."
2,Pretty Good Game,"This years Madden 2005 is a pretty cool game. I just wish they would improve the graphics like in ESPN NFL 2k5. The heads on the players look like really big dead ballons in relation to their body size and the crowd animations and grass textures are just plain ugly. As always, the Madden series has excellent gameplay and slick menu systems. John Madden's play by play is really cool. If the developers could improve the graphics this game would be awesome. I like my video games to look as realistic as possible like Doom 3 or Ghost Recon 2. Madden has the gameplay now they have to improve and update the graphics."
1,Madden's gone fishin'!,"I bought Madden 04 and I loved it, primarily due to the incredible new owner mode, but this year there's a new football champ and his name is ESPN 2K5. This game is amazing and it's only 20 bucks! Save yourself 30 bucks and go with the game that won best of show awards @ E3. Sorry EA sports, you lose! game over."
3,Worst Madden of All time?,After playing this game I started thinking what happened to the Madden games? All of the extra stuff they added this year was a waste why do I need Email and Some annoying sports radio personallity spitting out a bunch of jibberish that has nothing to do with what is going on in my season. I think they have gone to far and need to concentrate more on gameplay than all of the extra crap the surrounds it. I'm ready to play Tecmo Super Bowl because that is what it felt like I was playing with all the 75+ yd passing plays I had.
1,ROD WILL NOT EXPAND,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. First of all, the minimal directions do not accurately depict the product. Second, despite fervent attempts, the rod will not expand. I had other people try to help me expand it and they failed, too. This rod will not expand past 48 inches, despite the claim it will do so. Both target and amazon customer service were not able to offer any suggestions, either."
2,not the original song at amazon,"I was disappointed as this is not the original song I remember.If someone knows how to get the original copy ,please let me know"
5,greatest football game ever made,"madden 2005 is the absolute greatest football game made. the new defense options are great and the hit stick, phew, i love it. thats all i like to do on defense is use it on the quarterback for a sack, force fumbles, and the best part is when i hit the reciever so hard he just drops the ball. i also like how the game has tackles that are more realistic and u cant just bounce off of 5 defenders and run for 100 yards. you should really buy this game.p.s. the story mode is a great feature to make the franchise even more fun and competitive."
1,MADDEN TOO STALE,"MADDEN HAS GOTTEN BORING AND STALE. ITS TOO GENERIC. WHY PAY(...)FOR A NEW GAME EVERY YEAR WHEN THE ONLY THING UPDATED IS THE ROSTER. WELL, BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF SUCKERS OUT THERE.THANKS TO THE SUCKERS, EA HAS GOTTEN REALLY RICH. THANK YOU SUCKERS, BECAUSE THERE IS A FOOL BORN EVERY 10 SECONDS, EA WILL KEEP DOING THE SAME THING. AND THE FOOLS BUYING THIS GAME WILL KEEP BUYING THE SAME GAME."
1,Boycott EA Games,"I admit it, I have something of an ulterior motive in rating this game so low. It's a good football game, really it is. However, after playing EA Sports titles for the past decade, I've discovered a football game I like much better. Unfortunately, because of EA and the NFL's greed, exclusive rights to NFL licensed products has been granted...meaning we will not get an ESPN NFL 2K6 game. Hence, I will no longer be playing EA titles. For any serious gamers out there that welcome competition among our titles, thus ensuring that the best products are available, join my in my boycott. Like I said earlier, I prefer the bulk of EA's sports titles to the ESPN brand. However, I think their NHL and NFL products are surperior to EAs. But I'll no longer have a choice in NFL products. I'm not happy with either EA or the NFL."
5,better then the other football games,this game is way better then the other football game is has a great story mode. You will really feel like a GM like trading unhappy players. Also the graphics are the best. lastly if you can play on the internet you can download new rosters. which means you can play this game for a long time and not have an out dated team.
2,espn is better,"well i have only played madden at a friends house a couple times, and it disgusts me that people say this game is so great just because its madden and ea made it. espn came out of left field this year and just crushed madden. madden has no running game, but if you just air out hail maries all game, your receivers always catch it and take it in for the score. in espn, you can break out some great runs, and the passing game is very difficult. the franchise in espn is incredible, and managing a cap is very difficult. everyone complains about the offseason, but i think its great. whatever floats your boat i guess. espn has an amazing presentation, from the berman half time show to the weekly sportscenters and draft special, it all adds to the experiance.its sad to think that this will be one of the last non ea football games maybe ever, but its good to go out on a good note. with the new deal ea made, we probably wont see any other football games for a hell of a long time."
3,Ok,Debbie books are always good. As a new mother a book about aids wasn't as appealing to me as her other books are.
5,BARBARA FROM NASHUA NH,BIG FAN OF DEBBIE MACOMBERS BOOKS LOVE HER SERIES THIS BOOK IS A QUICK READ AND HAS IT TURNS BUT A HAPPY ENDING MAKE A CUP OF TEA AND ENJOY
2,NOT DEBBIE MACOMBER'S BEST,"I read the story, it held my interest, but her later books are much more exciting. However, the book did have a good message."
2,Nothing Special,"It fell short of my expectations! Had a hard time finishing the book. I have all of Debbie Macomber's books, always loved them and could not wait for the next one, however, they are starting to get boring. I hope that this is not the beginning of fast of the press no matter how bad!"
5,Beautiful piano music mixed in with dreamy Ocean sounds.,"This was the first cd my family ever bought right after we got the first cd player we ever got, and it was the only cd we had for a while.Well, it was beautiful. And it still is beautiful. So beautiful, I can't say in enough writing space how beautiful it is. Since they don't give you the track listing here at Amazon. com, I'll tell you what the songs are. There are 12 of them: ""Stroll Along the Shore,"" ""Bridge of Time,"" ""Riptide,"" ""Misty Surf Solitude,"" ""Tide Pool pondering,"" ""Song of The Ocean,"" ""Beaches,"" ""The Deep,"" ""Caribbean Current,"" ""Ocean Thunderstorm,"" ""Placid Pacific,"" and ""C of Angels,"" in that order. and since thay don't let you hear sound samples, either, let me just assure you that all of them are beautiful piano pieces mixed in with dreamy sounds of the Ocean. Whenever i listen to it on a Sabbath it takes me away to imaginary worlds where anything can happen.I reccommend it to you. Thank you for reading my review."
3,Some Illumination,"To start with, this film has some interesting lighting. It was shot in St. Louis on a limited budget by a local film production company with a lot of spirit. The director was educated in film school in Los Angeles and has worked on many significant projects in many capacities and has a very good visual sense. The cast includes a veteran actor who worked on Spielberg films and also the lead actress, Tuesday Knight, was torched by Freddie or Jason. My understanding is that this tape did well in the Asian markets."
4,Rural Life,"This book was very interesting to me. I just love the way the author seems to make the animals that are in the book such as the horses, birds, bees etc... have so much life. The country life seems to be fun and adventurous for someone like myself because things happen in the country that I would have never expected.the funniest part in the book was when the author is explaining to the readers how they had early birds singing get up songs. I also really enjoy the entire chapters being broken down into months because it was easier for me to coprehend what happened and when. This book is so inspiring and full of details."
3,Time for Truth,"Time for Truth is a more politically based informative novel, than a story. It is not that interesting unless you really like politics--and that is the politics of Iran. The novel is about one womens cry to change the world of Iran. The author, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi tells us of her fight with living in the royal family and with the U.S. as well as Khomeini. She lets us realize the difficult culture of Iran and how it condemns a woman to take part in the real world."
4,This would be perfect if it had ONE thing,"I really like this power strip! It's metal, very robust and you can mount it in different ways.. I actually drilled 4 holes two on each side of the metal tab for easier mounting... Everything about this is nice. WHY did belkin NOT make the plug that goes into the wall a 90 degree plug... seems sooo silly to me.. You give me 10' of cord, but it sticks out from the wall because of the straight plug...This would have easily gotten 5 stars if it had a 90 degree plug.-Nigel"
2,Photocopy quality,Difficult to read the text as letters are somewhat blurred. Pictures are faded. I'd rather own the original.
4,That's the one,"After searching for the best deal for this book...this was my last resort. As it turns out however, it was a bargain like I never even imagined. The best value in education."
5,A true outdoor classic.,"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in spending time with and learning woodlore from a man who has lived in close harmony with nature. This is a gentle year in the life of a woodsman who shows us how he lives with nature in all its seasons and moods. It is a true ""classic""!"
2,pilates intermediate,"A great DVD, with an intense 30 min workout. I take this DVD on trips, and with my laptop, I can easily keep up my exercise routine while away from home."
2,A major disappointment,"Being an Elvis Costello fan for some 15 years now, I was really looking forward to this disk, especially since the reviews have hyped it as a ""return to his roots."" Don't believe it. I count two good songs (""15 Petals"" and ""Tart"") and a few other ok ones (""Spooky Girlfriend""). The rest is not good, unless you are a BIG fan of his later, post-Spike work. There isn't a song on this album that is as good as the older material. It'll sit on a shelf alongside Mighty Like a Rose: i.e. unlistened."
1,"Masterpiece? If You're An Insect, Maybe","Eighty-some reviews clearly are not enough -- not when there's still an average of four stars showing for this incomprehensible mess of a cd. There isn't much I can add to all that's been already written here, but I do want to weigh in on the side of the nay-sayers. This batch of songs is so far below EC's old standards; I am utterly at a loss in trying to figure out what happened, or what Elvis was striving for. The sound quality is the worst I have ever heard, the horn arrangements are horrific, and the songwriting itself, well . . . it is just awful. And this from one of the greatest and most prolific songwriters of all time. Oh woe. And before you plunk down your money for it, whoa!"
1,Don't believe everything you read....,"I don't want to say something too strong, but the reviews I am reading are are so effusive that I can't take them seriously.For example, what do you mean that there has never been a terrible EC record? Honesly, HE would admit that. There have been any number of them. That is the very reason why he's worth listening to - because he's made bad records, too. Hello?Time will if this one stands up. Upon three listens, I doubt it, but I could be wrong. I used to think that Armed Forces was terrible, too, but now I see what was good about it. Nobody talks about that record any more....it's all My Aim Is True, This Year's Model and Blood and Chocolate. (Not even King of America, which amazes me....).Anyway, enough of your praise. Listen now, judge later.Cheers,"
1,Too cool for the masses,"Very disappointing CD from the man who wants to be considered the witty antagonist of ""Pop"". It's admirable that he has long harbored interest in all varieties of music....it's just unfortunate that he makes it all sound the same. His limited vocal range worked well in the driving, catchy rhythms of his early music....and his snide, often cruel insights worked well in his ""young angry man"" days. Now that he is older you would think he would temper his view of the world and quit trying to be so clever."
1,Boring,"Look, you can say all you want to justify this album, but for us lay people, a boring album is a boring album. This album sounded like one continous song - one of his non-descriptive songs that you've heard before but can't recall."
2,Elvis Is Dead,"It pains me to say that Declan McManus (his real name) no longer has the chops to fill an album with hits. Sure, he can still write great lyrics, but this album is sadly lacking in melodies. Without the foundation of hummable tunes, the music collapses. I think Costello deserved to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, but I was disappointed...ARRGHH!!!"
5,Does My Heart Good,"In this wasteland of silcon-injected pop blow-up dolls and computer generated boy bands, the unrivalled brilliance of Elvis Costello once again gives me hope for humanity. He is to music what David Lynch is to film. It's amazing but rewarding to see how well this CD has done on Amazon, and my jaw nearly dropped off when I saw it in the top CD spots at my local supermarket. I even heard the track ""45"" over the speakers at a local chain restaurant! Once in a while, the world wakes up and smells the espresso instead of the Sanka. Another gem in the crown of the King!"
2,Wrong Color and Slow Shipping,"I had ordered the brown color hair and I received black. To add insult to injury, the item shipped slower than projected (I used Prime shipping and received it in three days). The quality of this product is good, I'm not 100% confident in the company packing the order."
2,Not very good,"This book is not very good. For starters, a lot of great movies are place WAAY in the back. The list is good, but the ranking is way off. Not only that, but Toy Story is #25! That movie is a good one but I wouldn't even have included it in my personal Top 100 list."
1,Embassy 4pc 600D Nylon Luggage Set,This was a much cheaper product than I was expecting. There is not much I can do with it.
3,Helpful Information!!,"I read this book in preparation for giving a presentation and writing a term paper in a stress management class. I found that this book provides adequate information on how to recognize the symptoms of stress. It also gives useful tips on how to deal with the stress in a positive way. Towards the end, however, some of the information seemed repetitive."
1,Will Not Work on Win98 System,"Like other reviewers, I can't get this piece of junk to work on my Win98 machine. On my Windows 2000 machine it works, but with issues. Skip it and find something with less problems, more support."
3,Gospel Live - Yes! but no!,"BET could have done better than this. I'm a Praise & Worship Music Director and much of my youth in our praise band listens to many 'live' concerts. We didn't see any band on this DVD. We are big fans gospel/contemporary church music and we were disaappointed on this one. It was like watching a CD. This is a 'live' performance but no band. Sorry fans. IF you want to see a band behind the vocalists, look elsewhere. Thanks."
3,"More Pop, Less Power, More Sophisticed","Marilyn Martin's self-titled debut LP was one of my favorites of the 80's. So much so that I contacted her record label and got a press bio kit so I could do a profile on her for my college paper.This Is Serious was a good follow up, but did not live up to the promise of her first album Nothing on the album rocks like Night Moves. Possesive love was penned by Madonna, and her backup musicians even played on the track. That is pretty much where this album was; more pop than rock. It was well done pop just the same. It just lacked the character and edge of the first album."
5,Berenstain books,Love the Berenstain Bear books. This is a great story for helping children quit the blaming cycle. Used with my own children and my students.
5,The Best from tha Midwest,"Bizzy is my favorite bone member for the best reasons.He's the realest,the best lyrics,some might not like his voice but he always delivers.Alpha & Omega didnt get good promotions but tha S**t dont matter,all that matters is the music.This is the type of cd you listen to from start to finish,and you dont agree wit me F@$! you.HE'S THE BEST!!PERIOD"
2,Just aint fellin it,"Damn Bizzy, wtf is goin on? the production wasnt the best but thats not an excuse to f**k up songs lke that. The best song on the cd is i understand. That is somewhat Bizzy's old style and thats what he needs 2 bring back. Plus u gotta understand im not dissin Bizzy i got all his solo cds and all the Bone cds. Its just that i know that Bizzy can do MUCH better"
2,Not Feelin This,I bought this because Bizzy is my favorite rapper. But I didn't enjoy one track from this.
5,No more hum,Wow the hum was really annoying until I got my ground loop isolator. It makes watching tv barable now. The hum is gone and I am happy.
1,"Very, very American","I bought this with a lot of anticipation, having watched Dick van Dyke in movies like Mary Poppins & Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. But these sitcoms, I found, were strongly American in their flavour. Now, that not necessarily a bad thing but this is just for non-Americans to know that if you're not familiar with the American suburbia then this will all look rather insipid.In contrast, I Love Lucy (belonging to the same era I guess) is great fun for all."
4,Enjoyed watching show as a kid,I'll watch read or look at almost anything to do with Harleys. But I watched the show as a kid having only a few stations to choose from growing up in the north
5,Awsome Set,"What's with posting THREE long-winded reviews of the same DVD set? Mr. Von Pain truly needs to get a life.This season five set is just as fantastic as the previous four season sets. Notice that the ""I Love Lucy"" season collections are being released in much the same way - slim plastic cases inside a cardboard shell. It's sturdy, looks great on my shelf next to all the other DVD's and VHS tapes, and - MOST IMPORTANTLY HERE, FOLKS - the shows are complete and unedited!! Extras are nice, but having the episodes in their original form is the best thing since sliced cheese!I could say more about this set, but since that idiot Von Pain already droned on in THREE SEPARATE REVIEWS, I'll just say:Thank you, Image Entertainment!!"

2,The only episode I truly don't like,"This episode doesn't hold up well under the philter of time. A character in the show has a horrible secret that is tossed about a bit cavalierly, once it is revealed. It's unacceptable not only today, but back then as well, I imagine. The studio audience doesn't react very well either.It's a relatively average episode of the show up to that point, but that part just submarined it for me. I've seen the whole run dozens of time in syndication, but I don't remember ever having seen this episode before. Maybe this is why. I've never seen another episode of Dick Van Dyke that I just plain didn't like, but I anti-recommend this one."
4,Danville to Hollywood!!,"A short but descriptive review for those who don't need a synopsis of the show is in order here. A wonderful package and very good linticular printing on the front of both seasons' boxes. Nice extras, although it did seem as if the quality of the Emmy awards footage was a bit off with the vertical hold or something. One word of warning however, the ""documentary"" of the episode ""It May Look Like a Walnut"" is nothing more than recollections of the storyline and does not offer much at all of behind the scenes info. Editing on this was rather sloppily done. I am surprised that it was ok'd by the quality control department at Image entertainment. As for the episodes...they are pristine and very nicely transferred. Let's hope the remaining seasons don't take too long to be released!!!"
3,Chasin' crumbs of carrots!!!,"This DVD is a mere sprinkling of what the actual series has to offer it's fans. Although the quality is far better than the typical VHS copy (from cable) that we are all used to, it's still far from the quality that is possible. It is a real novelty to be able to choose what episode you want with a click from the remote, and not have to edit out commercials etc. Don't expect any extras from this DVD. There are NONE. Then again, this show has always withstood the test of time and technology by having a brilliant story performed by brilliant actors. No glitz, just glamour."
5,"The Dick Van Dyke Show , Season 3",It is a very humorous show! I like the couple that still sees romance in one another's eyes everyday . There is modesty being displayed in the show as well. Buddy and Sally still know how to crack a person up with their ways of show business. It is a thumps up to me as far as clean entertainment!
4,v. smile pocket,"I love this product for my 3 and 1/2 and 6 year old, my two year oldeven likes it, she just can't quite figure out how to play by therules yet!!Only complaint, it drains batteries really fast, so rechargeable arebest."
2,Screen size is much smaller on new version...,"I've had this portable machine for a few years, so durability was not a problem for me, but when I ordered a second one in 2009 I was shocked to see how different it was -- it's much smaller than the one I have and the screen went from 4"" to 3"" -- a big difference -- I'm disappointed -- I don't want my children straining to see this little screen, but we'll see how it goes..."
3,They Stepped Out of a Dream,"An intriguing, albeit somewhat superficial, look at the lives of three young women destined for stardom in the Ziegfeld Follies. While gorgeous Hedy LaMarr is merely decorative, the radiant young Judy Garland is marvelous in numbers like ""Minnie From Trinidad"" and ""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows"", and Lana Turner is a revelation as the spoiled beauty who succumbs to the darker side of stardom. Unfortunately, James Stewart is wasted in this film and does not pair well with Turner. This aside, the MGM glamour is spectacular, with stunning costumes by Adrian and set design by Cedric Gibbons. What a shame that MGM chose to film this in black-and-white, rather than Technicolor! While the film is overlong and somewhat dated, you'll rarely get the opportunity to see the likes of Garland, Turner, and LaMarr together in one film. For this reason alone, it should not be missed."
5,What a treasure!,"The description on the back says it all:""Come along on a wilderness sleigh ride in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Sleigh bells jingle and horse harnesses creak, church bells ring and happy voices cheer, rushing rivers flow and songbirds sing. These festive sounds are interwoven among Christmas favorites performed on solo piano with flute, guitar or saxophone accompaniment.""Gorgeous piano work in the tradition of Narada music. A CD I will treasure each year as Christmas rolls around!"
5,A real sleigh ride,"This is a great album to play during the Christmas season. We bought this a few years ago, but it was lost, loaned, or misplaced. So we bought another one. You should like it. It makes you feel as if you were on the actual sleigh ride! You can hear the horses and their driver calling to them as the very nice music plays."
5,Medical Assisting Exam Review for CMA & RMA Certification,This is a great book not only helped me pass the test for RMA but also improved the knowledge for my career.
4,Great study guide,"This is a great book for anyone preparing to take a medical assisting exam! The lay out is great and makes studying much easier. I was able to get through the whole book in a week and feel confident going into the exam. The only thing that I didn't love was the CD ROM. It only has one practice exam on it for both test types. It would have been more helpful to have a couple different exams, better preparing you for the exam."
4,MA,"From what I have looked through, this book is just what I was looking for. I have not had a whole lot of time to study for the test, but once I have time, I will be using this book to study."
5,Still their best,I've seen 'em a million times and have listened to all their stuff and this is still their best. The end.
1,Blink 182 Box Set,"I got this box set as a gift for my brother because Blink 182 is one of his favorite bands. When I received the item I noticed on the back of the box that this dvd was not authorized by the artist. That was a red flag and also the fact that whoever created the box cover spelled authorized with an ""s"" instead of a ""z,"" so I knew that this could not be legitimate. I returned the dvd for a full refund because I did not feel comfortable owning it, not to mention that the dvd is supposedly horrible from what I read. Don't waste your time buying this junk."
2,"Nice idea, just brought to market with a bug","What do you get someone who has everything? Something they don't necessarily want. I got this as a gift. Nice idea, it will cycle through pictures and remind me of who gave the frame to me. Here's the problem:If you overload the memory, the machine freezes. Aparently there is a firmware update, but I found out too late. The frame will not boot any longer and wont mount on my computer. (part of the problem is that the manual to operate the frame comes on a CD, and the manual is NOT Mac compatible... surprize the manual is not a pdf file).I had the same problem as the other reviewer, HOWEVER, I got better support. I got online, and their email and chat buttons were disabled, so I used their phone number I got from the web site. After navigating through the phone maze, I got a hold of a helpful agent. They are exchanging the frame. They are sending me a return box."
2,Too repetitious to do again,"Like other reviewers, I would not reach for this DVD again. You are taken in an out of your zone every 30 seconds, which allows you to dread each upcoming exercise. The work out is hard. And because you are repeating only 8 exercises, 1 at a time, it is very boring. Not what you want in a strenuous workout. You want the time to fly.I know Amy Dixon has her supporters, but I really do not like the constant narration. It's too shrill and distracting for me. Does not inspire or motivate. I prefer instructors who let the workouts speak for themselves."
5,Another great workout with Amy,"I'm a huge fan of Amy Dixon. I really like this video because it requires no weights or other equipment. It is pure cario. There are 8 exercises (performed 8 times each), each with 3 versions (ranging from less impact to most impact) performed by 3 different women. It is easy to follow and you can work as hard as you want."
5,Excellent!,"Amy will kick your ass. 3 different levels, so you can choose, but if you go all out (which is the point of Tabata and interval training) you will definitely get your cardio in for the day. I'm not sure she gets that point across as well as she should."
2,My Mothers Kitchen,"It is not a Kosher cookbook, when you put butter in matzo balls oh well you can change the fat."
4,Why the narrator is all time on the screen?,"I like theses series. Photography and background sound are simply great, as well as commentaries. The only thing that bothers me is looking at the narrator every 2 minutes on the screen.I wonder if it was really necessary for Mr. Attenborough to appear again and again annoying the beauty of landscape and animals."
1,Great series but full of evolutionist propaganda,"Great series but full of evolutionist propaganda, Sir Sir David Frederick Attenborough has spewed a lot of injures towards nature and its perfect design and complexity. I would like to debate with Sir David Frederick Attenborough about his unfounded claims. But it is great work in term of shots and researches."
4,Take a long listen . . .,"At first listen, I didn't think much of this CD. I have been a fan of Queensryche since Rage for Order, especially OM. I had lost interest as of late, not being a particular fan of HITNF or Tribe. However, as I listened to this CD a few more times and stopped trying to compare it to the original, I really started to enjoy it. I now feel that this is certainly their best effort since Empire. If you are truly a fan of Queensryche buy the CD, don't try to hold it up to the original, and enjoy it for what it is."
5,Mindcrime II Comes Through,"This cd is fantastic. From the story line to the music, this cd does not disappoint."
3,Operation Mindcrime II who killed mary !,"Hello, Hello, Hello..Its simple, if you are a Queensryche fan the Truth is in the first album.. The question.. Who Killed Mary?The Answer.. Mary Killed Mary, Her guilt and shame became too much and she killed herself on the alter.suicide.. you mean you guys couldnt figure that out 18 years ago..... Now go back to sleep boyz..."
4,Interesting,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I picked up this album after almost a 10 year hiatus from listening to QR, one of my favorite all time bands. I was so disappointed by the post-DeGarmo releases, that I just stopped listening and buying the albums. It was too sad.This album is kind of like an echo from the original Mindcrime album, which I've probably listened to thousands of times (it was the soundtrack to my '88, '89 and '90). Or maybe a fax. Or maybe an album down-sampled to 8-bit. It is enjoyable, but doesn't stand up to the original. Tate's vocals aren't what they used to be, but that's to be expected.Still it is enjoyable in it's own way. The throwback in production style provides continuity from the original. Don't expect it to blow the doors off like the original. Mindcrime was one of those albums that changed the way I listened to and approached music. This isn't that kind of album, but it is still a very listenable album."
4,It grew on me,"When I first bought this cd I couldn't understand the music, though it was hard, I couldn't follow it. I decided I didn't like it so I shelved it. After a while and being hungry for some Queensryche music, I decided I was going to at least give it three listens in a row. It worked, the music grew on me and I can follow it better. Now I enjoy listening to OMII. Sure its not OMI, but nothing will ever be again. I have to compare this cd to American Soldier in the way the music is played, the instrumentaion and Tates vocals. This cd is not as melodic as OMI, thats because we don't have Chris at lead guitar anymore. With him gone, of course this cd was not going to sound like OMI. Good effort though. On an A to F scale I give it a B- ."
2,Operation:Milk Mindcrime,"First off, there are a couple of songs on this album that are worthy of Queensryche. Unfortunately, Geoff Tate and the band decided to revisit a truly great album (and concept album to boot). An album of the caliber of OM1 should be left alone. It just goes to show that QR (or what is left of them) wanted to capitalize on their long lost success. A great band would never have felt the need to revisit perfection. Instead, that band would make a new, different album of perfection. I don't want to get into the whole Queensryche w/o DeGarmo discussion, but Queensryche just does not exist anymore - whether that happened with DeGarmo's departure or not, Queensryche is dead. What is left is a band struggle to make a name for themselves riding the moniker of a once great band."
4,OM2,"First off, the people giving this CD 1&2 star ratings are not Queensryche fans. Yes, every album after Empire was horrible. This, however is an incredibly strong comeback. You also have the people who are stuck in the 80's who want every band from that decade who still play today to have the exact same sound. No, this doesn't sound like OM1. It's an evolution and a recreation of that album for the modern day. Just because an album doesn't contain X number of singles or is full of catchy hooks doesn't mean it's bad. This is a complex and epic work. I know a lot of people can't relate to this or truly understand that. If you want a poppy, full of one liners and hooks work, go listen to a Poison CD. I like the diversity of this album. Queensryche finally understand that they are not Pink Floyd or an alternative band. With this album, they've finally hit a home run."
2,What happened to Queensryche?,"I had a chance to hear this CD before it's official release and I'm still waiting for it to grow on me. I find myself leaning toward ""this sucks"".I've been a ryche fan for many many years and was captivated by OMC, I dont know what this is suppose to be? Theres some good tracks but it falls too short of OMC to merit more than 2 stars.If your a fan than you will want to surely get this for the collection. If your new to this band then go back to the beginning and hear them at their best. Sorry guys....18 years wasent enough between Mindcrimes."
4,Come On It's GOOD!,Why all the negativity? Is it as good as OMC: I? I don't think so -- BUT -- it is quite good. It's a new album from a different Queensryche. I guess comparisons are inevitable since it's a sequel. But it is can't be the same album twice. The band is in top form on this new recording they are pheonominal musicians. My favorite tune is Re-Arrange You. How could no one mention this tremendous tune? Was everysong on OMC: I honestly good? NO. In my opinion this is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Queensryche.
1,broken,"A load of under 100 pounds was applied to the jack, whereupon, the plastic gear attached to the acme screw was stripped by the metal gear driving it."
3,Who thinks crowd noise is good?,"Who decided that it was good to have overpowering crowd noise on these albums? This isn't ""Frampton Comes Alive"".Sarah's songs are great, but the in-your-face live setting is a huge distraction."
3,"Fabulous, but variety is the spice of life......","Great voice, great personality, and great music! Sarah never fails to impress me, however, it would be nice to hear some different songs. Perhaps some b-sides, new surprises. And, yes...not so somber and depressing! Overall- quite enjoyable."
5,It's no Live at Leeds!,"I agree with those who recommend sticking with the studio albums, esp. FTE. The audience is too full of shrieking adolescent girls to enjoy the quiet beauty and sonic textures of SM. Same as at the concert, so to that extent it's fairly accurate as a document of her tour. Why do they cut off between tracks? I thought this was a live album, not an overproduced rehashing of better done studio cuts! also, NO INFORMATION in the liner notes of any worth: where was this taped and by whom? if you really want this one, wait a few weeks, it's bound to end up quickly in the racks of your favorite used store for a better price!"
5,Amazing Live,i have been to lilith fair and i think sarah is just unbelievable in person. she is so powerful and capturing through her music that it is just mind boggling. i love her music so much.
1,UGH!,"Sarah McLachlin has a load of talent evident on at least one of her previous releases (...Ecstasy). However, this disc falls well below expectations. If you're looking for a better new release, try the new Weird Al or Chemical Brothers CDs, as both are far superior to this slop."
3,Expectations are just future resentments!,"Sadly a poor performance. If a rockin' good time live performance is what you're looking for it, unfortunately, won't be found here. What starts off with a hot version of ""Building A Mystery"" quickly turns cold for the fan of live music. With only a few notable cuts, if good music is what's wanted you'll be better pressed to find it in original mix versions. Main problem is that songs are slowed down and don't have the spontaneous live feel with absolutely no banter except for one moment of chorus in Ice Cream with screaming audience straight out of a Beatles concert. You can sense this was a show meant for CD rather than to please an audience. Don't get me wrong, Sarah, Band and recording quality are in great form and CD should be purchased for true fan's collection. BUT if a good show is what you want stick with Alice (in chains)!!!"
3,Not as good as in-studio,This live recording is not as good as the studio version. It is nice to get a feel of the crowd but the quality of the recording is not there.
3,Where's Neil?,"I just wish this album did not share it's title with one of the best Neil Young albums ever. The album sounds, good...but it would be so much better without the backup singers. Great Set List Though...I'm sure it will be a success."
5,Essential,"Issue must be taken with people who say that ""you already have most of these songs"". Only the most casual listener could possibly make this statement. Just as you can not own too many versions of Beethoven's 9th symphony, you can not own too many different varieties of Sarah. The 'regular' album versions are clean and polished; perfect in their own way. The Mirrorball performances fully capture the essence of a live Sarah concert. Sarah's trademark climaxes are allowed to reach their full potential. Different aspects of songs are emphasized and de-emphasized. If anyone thinks this album is not significant... start listening more closely."
5,"Sarah, as always, has put out an exceptional piece of work!","My first Sarah CD was Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and then Surfacing. After hearing such beautiful talent, I decided to search for more of her work! I found Touch and Solace. INCREDIABLE! I also came across The Freedom Sessions! I've seen Sarah in concert 3 times, and this summers final Lilith Fair will make 4! Sarah's music is exceptionaly graceful and inspiring! I hope she will continue to write the extremly heart filled music for years to come! Thanks a million, SARAH!"
5,THE CD buy of the year!!,"As a long time Sarah McLachlan fan, this, in my opinion, is her best project yet. 'Hold On', 'Adia' & 'Building A Mystery' are my favorite titles, but the whole project is awesome. With a voice like hers, coupled with her back-up singers and incredible band, Sarah is THE #1 artist out there right now!! Can't wait for her next project!"
2,someone pass some new tunes...PLEASE,"I love Sarah and have for many years...heck I trecked up a mountain to see the first years Lillith Fair...but this album does nothing for me. It is the same songs we have heard for years and yes, it is very uninspired. With her amazing songwriting techniques, I would rather she focus on new material---not recycling old material that thanks to Sarah becoming more ""mainstream"" is being played to death on the radio. Im waiting patiently for some new, inspried tunes....And recommend that true Sarah fans pick up ""rarities and Bsides"" before buying this CD"
5,Great inspiring!,"This CD is the type for me. I love dancing lyrical and the so ""Do what you have to do"". It's so inspiring to me and all the other songs as well. I can't wait for another CD like this to come out and hope I can meet you one day.Amanda GrantCalgary ABAge 13"
5,Why did it take me so long?,"I purchased this CD awhile ago, and I'm not sure why I didn't get the chance to listen to it. But finally a few months ago I put it in my CD player and it hasn't come out yet!Sarah's lyical talent is amazing. And her voice is so unique and wonderful.""Hold On,"" ""Good Enough,"" ""I Love You,"" ""Do What You Have to Do,"" and ""The Path of Thorns"" were never released singles... but should've been! I absolutely adore these songs and play them over and over! I seem to be able to attach a part of my life to each one of them, and you probably will be able to do the same."
3,"Great Sound, But no variation","This CD was great. It was clear and lucid. I think the only downfall was that it collects various songs with little or no change in the live performance. The musical score was on the standard line of performance by Sarah, I was waiting for a little spice, but was let down."
4,Not her best,"I am a fan of Sarah McLachlan and recommend all her CDs, but this one is definitely not my favorite. When performing the songs it seems that she tried to make them more elaborate, but only succeeded in making them louder, longer, less intricate and less smooth. If you are a fan of the quiet calm of Sarah McLachlan's music, this is not the CD for you. It is worth listening to as is all Sarah's music, but you may be disappointed in what you hear."
5,German Boy: A Refugee's Story,"Suggest you replace the Booklist review with words from the September 4, New York Times Book Review. It's very good and one of the three most prestigious reviewers in the country."
5,German Boy,"This was one of the most moving war stories I have read. It tells the history of World War II and its' aftermath from a young German boys' point of view and how his family as so many other innocent Germans paid for the madness forced on them by Hitler. I came away loving this courageous boy who survived through his dreams and would later become one of the flyers he so idolized. It's definitely a page turner that makes one want more which is found in Wolfgang Samuels sequel ""Coming to America"". I highly recommend this book."
4,"Good option, but could be better","I like that these don't have all kinds of appliques and cutsie kid things. They are also terry cloth, so they are a bit more absorbent than a lot of the bibs of this size. However, as soon as it gets a little too wet, the wetness seeps down and gets the baby's shirt wet. My daughter is a spit-up queen, so we go through a half dozen of these a day. It really needs some sort of thin waterproof layer -- that would make this a 5-star product. The velcro is strong so it stays on the baby, however it's loud when you remove it so it sometimes scares them or wakes them up if they have fallen asleep with it on."
1,Austin Bazaar,"When this Autin Bazaar guitar was recieved, it was broke. I would not waste your money on this item. I contacted the company and we are at 4 weeks later and I still have not heard back from them."
3,Didn't fit as expected,"I consider myself to be a pretty solid size 10, and I occasionally wear a 10 W (usually with wiggle room for thick socks). I got these shoes in 10 W for extra comfort in a dress shoe, and they were too small in every direction. I returned them for an 11 W, because I did like the look of them. I hope they fit better!"
3,"Cute shoe, too narrow.","While this shoe was very nice looking and added height without being wobbly, the toe area was too narrow for my D width feet. Unfortunately, I had to return these."
4,exelent book,I use it as a reference all the time when I see an animal would be nice though if it had more info on all the animals and plants and insects
3,"Nice, but rushed","If I had read this book by Barbara Freethy first, I may not have read any others. While it's not a bad book, it has a very rushed feeling. I don't think that the characters were as well developed as those in some of her other books. The emotional impact was there in some regards, but sadly lacking in others.Try reading these books by Freethy instead: Golden Lies, Don't Say a Word, and Summer Secrets."
5,fantastic,This was a wonderful book from start to finish. The only trouble was a couldn't put it down. Lucky I was on holidays.
5,GREAT PRODUCT~~,"I GOT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON'S 3RD BIRTHDAY AND HE LOVES IT~~AFTER THE EDGES ARE SOMEWHAT DONE, HE TAKES OVER AND COMPLETES IT~~HE'S LEARNED ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND THAT HE LIVES ON EARTH BECAUSE OF HAVING THIS PUZZLE~~IT'S VERY WELL MADE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE USE OF MANY,MANY CHILDREN~~HIGHLY RECOMMENDED~~"
5,This was for my husband,My husband enjoys hunting and cooking what he hunts. This book is prefect for him. It gets me out of the kitchen. We received the book in great shape.
3,Reads more like a textbook,I bought this book because I watched the movie adaptation with Anne Hathaway and James Mcavoy. Although I knew that this was a biography I hadn't realized it'd read like a textbook. If you want just facts on Jane Austen and her life than this is the book for you. I will say that I am not a big fan of biographies but I thought I'd give this book a chance because I loved the film so much. Sometimes it's painful as I go from chapter to chapter as fact after fact is laid out. I'd say if you like biographies that read more like textbooks than this is the book for you.
4,Inspired by Rashomon?,"I would assume this film was inspired by Kurasawa's Rashomon, as it is about a killing & there are several versions of how it happened. In this case the battles were less heroic, as were the characters (rather ordinary semi riffraffy Americans). Some good actors & some who were not - I liked some of the characters. The killing was fueled by rivalry over a woman & her pain seemed real. The music of Johnny Cash gives this film a longer shelf life (can't miss with J.C.)."
4,The best side of Yngwie,"This is one of the best Yngwie-buy's ever made. If you're a guitarfan of any kind, this is a must-have. Yngwie shows his best side ever on this album released in the 80's. He plays technically with lots of feeling, energy and enthusiasm. Tracks 1, 5 and 7 are my favorites. Especially the quick tempo-switch on no. 7, ""Little savage"". Allthough Yngwie claims to use the same gear on every album, this one has a very special sound to it. The sologuitar is cleaner and more sustained than usual. It reminds me of like the sound of used on ""Trilogy"". Not too heavy not too relaxed, a great album made by a great guitarist."
5,Still Holds Up,"I loved this tape, yes tape, when it came out. I had since lost the tape but finally just purchased this on CD. I had to leave it in my truck's CD player for two or three days. I love this melodic metal."
3,It's OK,"You know, I have some trouble listening to 3,000,000,000,000,000,0000 notes being played at under 3 seconds. But yes, there is some melody. Black Star has always been my favorite Yngwie song, and Icarus was a good instrumental. But, there's almost no singing on this album. I would like some singing. And not by that horrible singer on Now your Ships are Burned."
1,A Waste!,"This is one of the weakest albums i ever bought! the only half decent song is the one by THREE-6-MAFIA, and it's not their best. do not buy this! go buy Project Pat-Getty Green, a REAL album."
4,PURELY ENTERTAINING BUT HOW DARE YOU DO THAT TO KYLE!!!!!!!,"I read Invisible Life and then rushed to the store for this book. I am still skeptical about letting people know that this author's work was so interesting but his writing touched several cords about my relationships with my friends and my own struggles. I however found certain aspects of the book disturbing (primarily the male love scenes) but tolerable since he didn't always go into great detail.HOWEVER,HE RUINED ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK. Yes , the character was mainly for comic relief but he brought a fresh perspective to things and while I understand the writer's need to explore certain themes and deal with the demons that lurk within him on the great scourge of the century...a happier summation for this character was definitely needed. Overall a good book and I am now awaiting my copy of Abide with me. Thanks for getting me to read again,E. Lynn Harris."
4,the sequel to Invisible Life,"Raymond is back trying to figure out where to go with his life. The only thing I didn't like about this book as much as the first, is the way the author jumps from first person character in each chapter. I got a little confused as to who was speaking next. It was still a great story though."
5,TIE ME UP AND MAKE ME READ IT AGAIN!,Mr. Harris you have kept me awake at night for the second time. I loved the way your book brings the story of Raymond to life in full living color. Keep up the good work.
4,A low point for Steve Winwood's vocals...,"...as well as the last groove-oriented Clapton appearance. Winwood's voice sounds strained and a bit out of tune here, in a way he had never been with Spencer Davis, and fortunately bounced back from in Traffic and his later solo career. His main contribution here is his organ playing and some pretty decent duet guitar leads with Clapton (especially in ""Had To Cry Today""--maybe that's what gave Clapton a taste for the duet work he later did with Duane Allman in Derek & the Dominos). For Clapton, this was the last time we were to hear his talent for extended jamming--from here on in, his vocals were what he focused on. As for Rick Grech, another reviewer dissed his guitar work on this page--maybe that's because he doesn't PLAY guitar here. He's the bassist on this set except for his violin work in ""Sea Of Joy""."
3,Wonderful packaging...so-so remastering,"If there is an award for CD packaging this should get it. It is the most beautifully packaged CD set I have ever seen! There is some very good music on these discs. To hear I Can't Find My Way Back Home, even in a mediocre remastering is to fall in love all over again. When you hear the quality of state-of-the-art remastering today as on the Beatles Number One album you can't help but think that they were working with some very bad source material here or that no one really care about sound quality. Cymbal crashes break up and bass sounds muddy and unclear and there is no sense of real spacing between the instruments or of their placement. Too bad, it's an album where the musicians and the package designers have done their job well and the album deserves better remastering. The jams do get a little boring...they are not of the high quality of the Layla jams, but it's good to hear them, none the less."
5,Real Rock,"This is one of the most beautiful recordings of Clapton OR Winwood's substantial careers. Although there are shades of Traffic, Cream and a serious Jazz flavor to some of the cuts, this has an extremely unique sound to it. The remaster is perfect, the extra cuts (including the electric version of ""Can't Find My Way Home"")are great, although the second CD's jamming is a bit weak. CD 2's jams were recorded before most of the other tracks and it's obvious that the musicians were just learning to work together. If you're a fan of late 60s early 70s rock, you must have this one."
2,Blind Faith,"This import is recorded horribly. The highs are exaggerated, and the bass none existent. I usually buy the import because it is recorded better, but stay away from this one. Try the original or go with the the live concert. This cd is going straight for the car and will not be played on my stereo again. The music is the best, too bad for the recording."
4,"Very very nice, but...","I dont understand why they included this many so-so jams here, on disc 2. I have the German Polydor BF disc from 1986,(825 094) which contains 2 extra studio tracks from Oct, 1969, previously unreleased: Exchange & Mart, and Spending All My Days, which are agreeable if not better than this live stuff...Because these are not on this new set, 'Deluxe Edition' this aint!"
4,Back in the Sixtie's!,I love Eric Clapton! This CD has a few of my favorites on it! Music was better in the 60's and 70's!
4,Fly on the Wall,"Cream died a horrible death of egos. It's easy to see why this group followed similarly. Ginger, as great as he is, should not have been allowed to join this group, or Winwood and Clapton would have kept going. I think it's great that we get to hear the jams, as well as classics (Presence of the Lord and Can't find My Way Home), on this set. If you're a Clapton or Winwood fan, this double disc needs to find a home in your collection. Still, not quite essential."
3,Good historic album,"This was the ""album of the semester"" in my dorm when it came out. You could hardly walk down the hall without hearing Blind Faith. We all enjoyed it for several months. Excellent tunes! This is a very nice collaboration of some of this era's finest British Blues artists and would be a welcome addition for anyone who has loved Traffic, Cream, et al. However, for me it has not worn as well as some of the timeless music from that era: the best Hendrix, early Santanta, A-Bros, and even Its a Beautiful Day."
5,Blind Faith CD,"We have the original album, but it nice to have it on CD to preserve the old album. Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton! It just doesn't get much better than that! A timeless classic for any rockers collection."
3,Pretty good sound quality,"This is of course, a classic album. The music is terrific.The quality of the transfer to CD is good. The midrange is sounds natural, if a bit thin. The high end is crisp but attenuated. Snare drums sound like thumps without any underlying detail or resolution. The low end is also very thin. Bass does not go down very far, but what's there is not muddled. The best part of the transfer is the air -- you can hear the space around individual instruments and at times sense the sound stage in which the musicians are playing. The best examples are on Jelly Jelly with the organ, electric guitar solo and to a lesser extent, piano.All in all, a pretty good deal for an album from 1973."
1,No Digitally Remastered,"Product Dscription says ""Digitally Remastered Album"" and what I got was a Capricorn Classic Reissue,the sound it's no good, I wrote to Amazon about it, did not get any response."

1,Peach Cobbler mix,Calhoun Bend Mill - Peach Cobbler mix...I'm very disappointed in this mix - I used fresh peaches too........but 7 min. before it was suppose to be done it was already too brown & over done.....I really don't care for the taste also.
5,"Solid, insightful, scholarly, and very strongly recommended","Worship And Wilderness: Culture, Religion, And Law In Public Lands Management by Lloyd Burton (Associate Professor of Law and Public Policy, and Director of the Program in Environmental Policy, Management, and Low, Graduate School of Public Affairs, University of Colorado - Denver) is an informed and informative survey and analysis of how different forces intersect to shape the management of public lands and resources in the past, in the present, and in the foreseeable future. Offering a cautionary glimpse of the risks and benefits of multiple-use management of public lands and a great deal more, Worship And Wilderness is a solid, insightful, scholarly, and very strongly recommended contribution to Environmental Studies reading lists and reference collections."
1,Trese-greasy-flaky Hair,"Both my boyfriend and I have learned to stay away from this shampoo. For my boyfriend, it makes his fine, light hair very dandruffy. For me, it makes me dark, coarse hair extremely greasy quickly. Even with our completely different hair types, this brand does not agree us. Definitely not recommended!"
3,loved it till i read that the ingredients listed 'xanthan gum (thickening agent)'!!!,"i originally gave this five stars, and said it was like drinking really good lemonade. then i read the ingredients and saw that what was giving it that consistency wasn't lemon or lime pulp, but rather 'xanthan gum (thickening agent)'! yuck!"
4,Yo Yo,My 11 year old son was thrilled when this yo-yo arrived in the mail. We never knew how hard it was to find a yo-yo in stores. It performed well and he could do many trick he could not do with his previous yo-yo.
3,"Very pretty, but kinda useless","First, the positive: this is a very complete and very pretty-looking guidebook. It does cover just about everything from the night sky to lichens and rocks. I can imagine an eastern tourist leafing through, anticipating all the wonderful things they'll see on their trip through Rocky Mountain National or Glacier park.However, in the field, the guide is next to useless, as there are no keys, no list of the details and differences that make, for example, one tree a Ponderosa and another a Lodgepole pine. The only way to disern what exactly you are look through the book randomly until you happen upon a photo (generally too small to supply necessary detail) that looks kinda similar to whatever it is you are trying to identify.This book is best at capturing the endless possibilities of our Rocky Mountains, a compendium of all the wonderful things you may run across. It won't however help you actually find them."
5,Helpful guide,"I just moved to Colorado, and this is a great, affordable option to buying separate guides for birds, trees, insects, and minerals. There is so much information packed into the book, and yet it is small enough to take on any hike."
2,The ultimate Golf learning Experience,About what I expected. Wally is an excellent golf teacher. Shows you many ways to get it done. Cd is more than 10 years old but still very effective.
4,"nice light,","Got this for the Church sound board (do wish the goose neck was a tad stiffer), It is stiff enough but can move very easily,IT is doing the job for us,"
1,very bad,The first movie of the series was cute and heart warming but since then the product has very quickly declined. The cast is not the same and it shows. The plot is stupid and the acting very mediocre.
5,"Great for chapati, pancakes, and crepes on radiant stove top","I love this griddle. It has even heating and you always know when it is how enough. I cooks pancakes and chapati very quickly and nicely. So far I've had it for a few weeks and it has worked so well that I was considering buying one for my mom. I was by hand to extend the life of the coating and I hope it lasts. I've been through two others like this, but they were quickly ruined with regular use. It is great for flat glass stove tops as it is heavy enough not to warp, but light enough not to break the stove top."
5,Good Madden Game,This is a solid Madden game for the GameBoy Advanced.The product was delivered on time and in good working condition.I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
1,Dissopinted,"Wrong size for me. I'm a big guy and this bike is to small. Bike got to my house damaged, I sent it back and the second time it arrived more damaged then the first bike. I repaired the second bike and gave it to a needy faimly. Good luck if tou buy from these people.Al Pelletier"
2,Christmas present,"I got this bike for Christmas. I don't know what the deal is with this bike. Maybe it was put together wrong, maybe I got the wrong parts but I cannot turn and pedal at the same time because the pedal will scrape the tire. How is this even possible?"
5,The best vegetarian cookbook of all time!,"This cookbook has all the basic recipes for making tasty meatless entrees, high in protein and so delicious. Everything from bean burgers to cashew cheese spread, from egg & cheese ingredients to dairy free recipes. There is everything you could want in this book. And all the recipes are simple. Some of the seasonings may be hard-to-find, but you could ask at health food stores, or you could just substitute your own seasonings. But most of the ingredients are very basic. One of my favorite recipes are the pecan meatballs made from pecan meal, cheese and eggs. If you use these meatballs in stroganoff or spaghetti, you will think you have died and gone to heaven!"
4,Another cool looking McFarlane toy for display!,"I absolutely love McFarlane Toys, as they have some of the coolest looking sculpts around the action figure market. This figure is quite durable, having taken a fall multiple times from my desk. Very basic pose-ability joints, you can't really give him any dynamic poses like you would with ball jointed figures. But this figure makes up for it with it's great looking sculpt. Safe for play and great for display."
4,nice supplement,"It fit alright for children over 5; below this age, 1/2 ""princess"" daily should be enough"
3,"Light, bottom very slippery","it's a tefal, so can't expect too much for the price. it's very light - some cooks will prefer a heavier and more stable wok, while some may prefer a light one where it's easier to handle when it's full of food. the bottom of the wok slides around too easily for my liking, especially when i like to slide the wok over the fire from time to time. and if you don't hold on to the handle the wok will slide when you are stir frying. i would have preferred something heavier but not complaining too much at this price."
5,Super slick non-stick wok,"I'm enjoying this wok, it's super slick, non-stick surface is great, you don't need to even add any oil as everything slides right around.It's light, not too heavy to lift while cooking & so easy to clean.Great value for money & I'm really pleased with my purchase."
5,I.LOVE.THIS.PAN.,"I was looking for a wok which I could use on my new ceramic stovetop. Since it arrived, I haven't used any other frying pan. The pan heats so evenly and is deep enough to contain anything I have stirred up yet! I even have used it once to fry two ribeye steaks (which lay perfectly flat in the bottom of pan) AND I fried four chicken thighs in it. Cleans up wonderfully, also. The only drawback is that it didn't come with a lid. I have used my biggest glass lid (which is pretty big) and it doesn't come close...but it works. Buy it, you'll like it."
3,Chopped song is not a Splendored Thing!,Is there any music lovers at Universal/Polydor? Is the money so important that you have to keep releasing the same old tired disc.Love Is A Many Splendored Thing is chopped off at the end again!Stop the insanity and release it thy way you know it should be. The way you would want to hear it. If the segway into Grease (reprise) is so important then include both on the disc. Please!!
3,A silly but fun musical,"If there is one thing that truly frustrates a Broadway fanatic like myself, it is the success of Grease. With many better shows out there, this is the one that gets performed every time you want to make an easy buck. However, if you don't mind a very light musical, this is the version to buy. I made the mistake of purchasing the Tommy Tune remake and it is AWFUL. John Travolta when he was young and thin is a thing to hear, as he plays this part with great skill, and the rest are good enough not to pull it down."
5,Grease has the coolest movie and soundtrack!!!!!!!,"I love just about all of the songs and the first movie. The second movie doesn't have the same people in it so it isn't as great, it is still a good movie. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John "" Go Together "" so well. I have only watched this movie 9,999,999,999,999 times so I better go watch it one more time so it will be 10,000,000,000,000 times."
3,Grease,"I thought I ordered the dvd, instead I found I had the sound track. I was disappointed, however, it is a very good soundtrack."
4,worth reading!,"Very insiteful. Made me realize I was doing a lot of things right but that I used to do it all wrong. It's a great guide for women, and it shows that relationships still take work and patience (and understanding). So make sure you love your man, that he is worth it (has a job, etc.), and you are willing to put forth the effort, or don't bother reading it."
5,Great book by a respected author,"James Madison is one of the most influential founders and considered the 'Father of the Constitution'. This book gives a brief, but well written overview of his life and his contrubtion to our system of government."
2,Not the same as they used to be.....,"I ordered a pair of these a few weeks ago, and althought they fit fine, the material is not the same as it used to be. It appears to be thinner and lighter in weight. It wrinkles badly in the wash and feels more like lightweight canvas than denim. Visually it's different too. These have vertical white threads that don't show in the online pictures. I would not buy these again."
1,Ripped on third wear,"I bought three pairs of these jeans, and all fit perfectly and looked fine. However, on the third wear of one of them, the fabric started ripping along the edge of the back left pocket. There is now an enormous hole in on the seat of the pants, rendering them unwearable. I knew these jeans were cheap, but I got them because I'm losing weight an planned on fitting into them for only a few months. That they delivered only a few days is extremely disappointing."
4,Big Guy Approved,"6'3"" 260, these jeans fit great. Still holding up, the only shows of wear is around the rear belt loops, it seems the material is thinning and hole has appeared. Overall these are great jeans and look fine on."
5,The Illest Album of '99,"Whoa...U-God surprised me with this. I always liked son, but I never thought he'd come this hard. His album is like the best Wu Solo Album since Rae and Ghost's albums. Golden Arms reminds me what Wu is all about on this album. Every single song is ill. He tells the best story rhyme ever on Night The City Cried. U-God has jumped from my number 12 to my number 1 MC. This is hot to death."
2,NOOOOOOOOOOO!,"U-God and INS are my two favorite members of the Wu, but this album is so disappointing, I'm just furious. I waited so long, and this is what I get? I've listened to the song ""If It's Alright With You"", from the Great White Hype soundtrack a million times because U-God's verse from that song was incredible. This is a big change from that amazing track. All Wu solo releases need to be produced by the Rza. If not the Rza, then someone else and not the Wu-elements. However, I still have some faith in the Wu."
2,not so enthusiastic about it...,"since i couldnt find the YS pollen in the supermarket, i bought this. although i understand that different batches of pollen vary, i found both batches i purchased to be rather dry and not nearly as tasty, even though High Desert markets this as a 'blend of pollens'. i was mostly upset that this pollen was not organic, which means that the bees could have been collecting pollen from genetically engineered crops.one should be health conscious to buy pollen in the first place. so get the YS organic pollen instead, since the pollen is collected from remote hives far removed from any genetically engineered sources. additionally, the taste is far better and the granules are soft, not hard, and are not slightly bitter like the High Desert brand."
2,Bad but beautiful.,"Elvira, a woman who will make you glad you stayed up those late nights watching bad movies. Gamera, a giant monster turtle who fights against other monsters. Talk about beauty and the beast! The movie is as bad as bad gets. It features poor dubbing, bad audio and is a lame story overall. I found it bearable only because elvira is genuinely entertaining in the few bits you see her in. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it because elvira has her own movie so watching this for her is nearly pointless. If you like old monster movies please search elsewhere. You can find this in better quality and possibly in japanese language if you look hard enough."
4,I liked the Book,The book was easy reading. Very straight forward. I liked it. Informative and interesting.
4,one of the best books,This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. very well explained and detail oriented from the point of view of the muslims
2,Not Strong Enough to Last,"This mandoline worked pretty well for me for a couple of years. Then the plastic handle broke off and I could not use it anymore. If I do replace it I will definitely get a heavier-duty model. I say ""if"" because the utility of these slicers is roughly offset by the danger they pose to your fingers. That's because the pusher-thingee that they include is awkward to use most of the time."
4,"Speedy Prep, but a Little Dangerous","I got this mandoline as a present for my mom, who had been wanting a very basic mandoline for a long time. I hesitated for years because of how dangerous they were, but this model seemed easy to handle and I thought the safety guard would be perfect. We used the mandoline on Christmas day to slice potatoes and found that it made really quick work of a usually laborious task--but the guard was a huge hassle and didn't hold the potatoes well. As a result, we did most of the potatoes without the guard, which was not very safe considering how fast your hand is moving. We had the best results when we held the potato without the guard until we sliced half of it, then fit on the guard to finish the rest of the potato.I also hoped the slicing thicknesses would have been more diverse--they were all very thin.Overall, it is a great little gadget for someone who just wants to slice things quickly, but it would be much better if the safety guard was more usable."
2,Shallow and Pedantic,"I should qualify this review by stating that I am not an expert on the subject of improvement. This book will not make you or even guide you to expertise. The only shining concept within the book, PDSA, is a great format for structuring improvement within a company, but could have been summed up successfully in 20 pages or less. BOOKS SHOULD NOT SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR VOLUME ADVERTISING THEMSELVES!"
5,replacement battery,"the product arrived on time, in working condition, and is working as intended. Time (until replacement is required) will tell if it is a good product or not."
1,Packaging,"The battery was delivered today and the battery was not in the originally packaging; it is very clear this is a used battery. The battery that I am replacing looks newer than this one! When I originally purchased there was no mention of it being a used battery. I'll update the post on performance and longevity of the battery, but I'm not expecting a lot!"
2,Where are the basics?,"The collection of apps here are fascinating. But I looked for a tutorial telling me ""this is how you embed a map, select several points of interest, and label them."". It was not visible."
2,Somewhat boring,"I was very disappointed with this book. It just seemed to go on and on. The ending was contrived to me, the story was interesting, but it was boring at times."
5,Marjorie Morningstar,"This was a book-of-the-month offering while I was a high-school junior. I read the book and shocked my English teacher by using it for a book report. Even my young mind found Wouk (pronounced ""woke"") to be an extravagently good writer. For decades he was my favorite living American author. Living on the edge of the Catskills and not far from New York, the characters were very real to me. Later, I thought that this book was perhaps the inspiration for the film ""Dirty Dancing."" Wouk loves his characters and has a genius perception of makes them (people in general) tick. Mothers and 17- or 18-year old daughters will find insight into each other by reading the book. Goyem guys like me will find thoroughly enjoyable tutelage into women in general and Jewish women in particular. Even after half a century, I heartily recommend Wouk's books to all readers."
4,"Very absorbing, not quite satisfying.","I spent two long days with this book in my hand, with my usual fervor an excitement for the intrigue of Wouk's characters, which are, most certainly, colorful and believable and very real. I left with a slightly sour taste in my mouth, however, as I am a dreaming seventeen-year-old, and the contented and quiet end of the heroine is totally devoid of the idealism which she once felt, and the glamor of which she once dreamed. Life does not turn out as any of the characters originally expected or wanted(I assume this is the general theme) and I guess I'm just a bit too young to be confronted with such a reality."
5,Marjorie Morningstar,"Marjorie Morningstar...The title of Herman Wouk's book makes me smile, and as I remember the vivid characters that live inside this book, I smile again. This is a bittersweet tale of youth, love, the stage, and New York at the beginning of World War II.It sounds like a simple story, an upper-middle class Jewish girl in New York, her struggles to become a stage actress and to separate from her oppressive parents who are deeply settled in the protocols of their faith. Yet, as Marjorie's life unfolds on the pages of this book, we fall in love with not only Marjorie, but the wonderful cast of characters who make up her life.Marjorie Morningstar should be listed as one of the greatest books of the past century and I urge anyone who is interested in great writing by a master craftsman to read this much-cherished novel."
1,did not fit,i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size. when it got here i was about two sizes two big. just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast.
5,the best,"i am a 36D and love this bra. i went to victoria's secret, got a personal consultant, and tried on a bra from every line. none of them worked. then, i went to a TJMaxx and found this one and it fit perfectly and looks great with a T-shirt. It's the only one I'll wear now."
1,Not for young kids,"Box consists of colored paper, stickers, and a small booklet on how to fold with no words.It is very hard to figure out and I doubt a 6 year old could do it. My 7.5 year old couldn't.By the time I could figure it out the novelty wore off. Now I just have an over priced box of colored paper.You could probably go on the internet for free and find ways to fold paper into airplanes."
2,Difficult for child to do himself,Bought this for my 8 year old and he had a very difficult time folding these planes himself. The paper is very nice and heavy but it made folding the planes even more difficult. The instruction booklet isn't very helpful either. Would not buy again.
1,"Totally confusing ""directions""",The directions for this product are next to useless. They give very short cryptic directions in 4 languages with the result that they are not intelligible in any of them. Would not recommend this product!
5,I like it !!!!!,"What is there thats bad that you can say about Rod Stewart ? I know I can't, I like it !!"
4,Newcastle,"surfing photography was absolutely excellent. for young new actors, the boyswere excellent. very good eye candy throughout the whole movie."
1,What a pointless movie,"Having seen so many good reviews about this movie, I even pre-ordered it months in advance. How disappointing I was when my BF and I watched it the day it arrived. We got through about 30 minutes before looking at each other and turned off the DVD. First, the actors have such heavy accents that even the English they are speaking is largely unintelligble. OK, fine, if that were the only flaw, I can live with that. After all, I own many foreign language films. Of course, they have subtitles. Second, the story line was disjunct and didn't even make sense. It jumped all around. Third, when the movie was over (yes, I eventually watched the whole thing, painful minute by painful minute), I didn't feel an ounce of connectivity to any character. The movie's tag line (You're Only Young Forever Once) makes no sense in the context of the story (a la lack thereof). Waste of money."
2,Ok Drama Terrible gay porno,"ok the drama of this is pretty good and the guys are almost all hot and u get to see the hot guys nude pretty good and two of them have sex but with girls and there is never gay sex not even men making out, this was under gay porn i feel really cheated near the end u get to see the hottest guy's ass and full frontal quite a bit but never any gay sex"
5,Nothing is Sacred,"Everyone seems to think this is the worst LORDS cd but I disagree. Although there is very little continuity between the song styles, I think this was a very brave album for the band.If you enjoy the recent never to be officially released LORDS CD ""Hang On"" you will not like ""Sacred"" at all. Gone are Treguna's brilliant bass lines, Nicks thumping surf drums, and Brian's stones style. All of which are the glue for SACRED.This other reviewer must be Steven Marque because he keeps on trying to use his name to compare and yet has absolutely nothing in common with Stiv's talent. Shame on YOu Steven Marque. That is really pathetic and so is your ""talent"""
4,An Instructive Journey,"Barry Callen has put evangelical scholars in his debt with this intellectual biography on Clark Pinnock's theological development. Pinnock's own journey is a sort of ""microcosm"" of evangelicalism itself, which makes these insights encouraging and instructive. (In this sense, the book reminds me a little of George Marsden's ""Reforming Fundamentalism""--a history of Fuller Seminary which, as an institution, also provided a glimpse into the struggles and growth of evangelicalism as a whole.) Though *almost* bordering on the hagiographic at times, Callen does an excellent job of distilling the key themes of Pinnock's theology and allowing us to glimpse how Pinnock's mind has changed. By focusing on the process and development, Callen sketches Pinnock as a model of genuine evangelical engagement who is not afraid to engage broader currents, and not afraid to change his mind. Both Pinnock's work and Callen's account of it are exemplary in this regard."
1,Waste of money and time,"Arrogance is awash in this video. The 'postmodern' style in which it is filmed is really nothing more than self promotion. It's extremely annoying and distracting to the point of not being able to follow what's being said. Is there any real point to having three people involved in the speaking of the same sentence, other than to show how cutting edge the editors are? The only reason I bought this was because of D.A. Carson's name, but don't be fooled. The video is just about how avante garde and in tune with God's purpose for the church are the makers of the film. If only we had their spiritual discernment we could join them in looking down on the rest of the church. As it is, I think there is enough of that condescending, un-Christlike attitude already. I wonder if they think Jesus has given up on his church as well. Now there's a thought."
1,NOT THE REAL THING!,"Except for Stacy Keach, this show was a complete bombI had bought the dvd at an auction....because when I was looking at the credits, Lindsay Bloom, who played Velda, was listed....but to my surprise (yikes) this wasn't the Mike Hammer from 1984Don't waste your money!"
3,Hammer Redeux,"When CBS has the First incarnation of Stacy Keach as Mike Hammer, it was harder and gritter like the books. Then Keach got busted for drugs in England and they canceled Hammer.I do not remember who revised Hammer. This time saddling with an assistant (played by Robert Conrad's son Shane) and a younger, perkier Velma (played by Shannon Whirry). Thes new adventures of Hammer seek weaker and died a quick death as a series in a season of 26 episodesAll twenty six episodes are here in this box set. One can only wish the first incarnation will be available soon--then you can see the real Mike Hammer as it was in the shows Hayday and gloryBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
3,2nd Mike Hammer Not As Good As First,"When I bought this video I thought it was the 1980's series. Although it has its good points, I would not recommend it. There is more violence as well as sexual aspects that make it more unappealing to me. Stacy Keach does a good job, but the plots are predictable and the narration by Keachis so complicated that it is hard to keep up with. Again I have enjoyed it, but it is not nearly as good as the Mike Hammer series in the 1980's.The fact that it did not last long on the air should tell you something about it."
3,Not Quite the Character from the 1980s,"This collection is not from the series in the 1980s, but rather originates from a short-lived syndicated run in 1997. Stacy Keach made the character then, and his strong portrayal still comes though. Unfortunately, it looks like scripting, direction, and producing fall short. Gone are the location shots of New York City, Mike gets a sidekick, and -- worst of all -- Mike gets beaten up several times!! And he doesn't give it back! Whether this was done to reflect Mike's aging or whatever, this is not quite the Mike Hammer many of us die-hard fans have come to know and respect. Still worth buying, but I recommend on sale."
4,Very cool!,"This is a nice single from the Backstreet Boys. Incomplete wouldn't have been my first choice for a comeback single, but is a great song and I love it. This CD also contains My Beautiful Woman, and the non-album track Moving On, a mostly accapella song that features some wonderful vocals from the guys. This is also an enhanced CD and contains the Incomplete video. I highly recommend this single for BSB fans."
4,It helped me!,"I think the quizzes and exercises in this book really helped me become aware of how I feel about my body. After I was through reading and working through it, I genuinely felt better about my body. The most useful part was weakening my reactions to what I saw in the mirror. I would recommend this book to anyone who constantly compares themselves to other people!"
3,How great are elves,"Though this was a reasonable fantasy novel I found that the author spent to much time talking about how the wood elves were better then humans at everything (which is why I dont have alot of love for elf centric books).Despite the ""elves are so much better at X"" I did like the way the book made the wood elves seem alien. These elves were more then the long-lived pretty people I've found in many fantasy novles."
4,This Album IS A SHOCKER!,"When artists like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Jay-Z first came, they both showed the world they had talent by dropping their first albums. Mos Def does the same. For any true hip-hop who listens to this, will be amazed of his skills. Lyrically, Mos Def lyrics match up well with Biggy smalls and 2 pac. As for the beats they are well too and can be matched with the syle of Busta Rymes and Q-tip. Prediction: No Sopomore Slump!"
5,classic,This CD is a classic. Mos Def explores all topics and spits with such energy it just boggles my mind. He deserves to be on top. Get this album now!
4,Take a break.,"Take a break from all of those thugged out cd's you've been buying lately (Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, etc.) and check out Mos Def. This is a nice cd that does almost everything. He spits a little knowledge here, he puts in a nice sample there. Put it all together, and it adds up to money well spent. He even has the nerve to play some instruments (let's see how Snoop does with a piano staring back at HIM). I really dig the insturmental at the end of the cd. Two other tracks, besides ""Ms. Fat Booty"", to check out are ""New World Water"", and ""Mr. N----"". Bang!"
4,only a few Hip Hop crusaders will realize what a gem this is,"the mighty MoS is one of my favorite emcees, from stage presence to lyrics for fun or mind delegation...he displays talent. the anticipation i had for this LP was met with a wide open vacuum that pulled me into his world. from the b-boy sound of ""Hip Hop"" to the jazzy soul of ""Umi Says"" and the ""Rock and Roll"" discrediting glorified artist who have ""borrowed"" styles of true infamous artists. Mos produced a few tracks. So did Primo and the phenomanal 88 keys. Guest appearances by Ms. Mojica, Q-tip and Weldon Irvine. The track with a guest appearance by Busta would be a hot single to get Mos a little more notice in the main stream. But he don't need. Simply said...Pick up the album. Love to the Massive."
5,A True Hip Hop Master,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this CD after only hearing a few cuts from Mos from some of his Blackstar stuff. What I later learned was that Mos Def is a true Hip Hop genius. This CD really sums up what he is all about, his lyrical cunningness, and witty delivery on tracks like ""Brooklyn"", ""New World Water"" and ""Ms Fat Booty"". But the shining light comes in the form of a relaxing and somewhat abstract track entitled ""Umi Says"", which draws attention away from the essential hip hop beats which encompass the album, and focuses on a different style altogether. This maybe signals the direction that undeground Brooklyn artists like Mos Def are taking. The CD finishes with the stylish ""Mathematics"" produced by the ever famous DJ Premier and the instrumental ""May-December"". Overall, this CD has diversity, big hits and the odd track that takes a while to figure out but ultimately is rewarding if you give it time, pretty much like the whole album."
4,CREATIVE BUT NOT PERFECT........,"We all know Mos Def is an extremely talented hip-hop artist.Probably one of the most respected as we know it today. ... Now on tothe album, its nice, a lot nicer than the average hip-hop album. Sometracks such as ""Climb"" and ""Brooklyn"" along with""MsFatBooty"" are classics. Others on the other hand are farfrom original. I have mixed feeling about the album. I wanted togive it 5 stars, but then I wanted to give it 3, so I just settledwith 4 to be fair. If you are an extreme hip-hop fan get this, youwill ""Mos Definitely"" enjoy this. I loved this album whenit first came out, but it can get played out real easily. ... Thisalbum just recently went gold (selling 500,000 copies) and it has beenout for a little over a year. Much love to my man Mos, I hope he canmake the right steps in his music to keep my respect."
5,The mos perfect Hip Hop CD yet,"This is the stuff that real bboys listen to when they chill. Let it play through. Loop it. Ply it at random. It doesn't matter. I could (and have) listened to the whole CD three or four times in a row without getting tired of it.This CD represents everything positive that Hip Hop is and at the same time everything Hip Hop should be and should strive for. All in all, one of the most intelligent albums around. If I had to pick one song as my favorite, it would be New World Water. It's theme of the effects of upsetting the balance of nature by mistreating the environment and each other is one which I think has never been tackled by any artist. Mos Def's lyrics are original, intelligent, and humorous. Some of the tracks don't even contain rapping, and just feature Mos Def's soulful voice putting a new spin and perspective on old tunes."
3,who's listening pleasure ?,"now we all know who Mos Def is and we all feel him.thats easy.making an album that stands the test of time isnt.many times during his debut long player he decides that a formula is the best option,relying on his talent rather than bringing all he has to offer.beats remain comfortable while Mos makes his moves feel contrived.the rock section cutting in on an vital track ruins the feel that it was tryin to create.Now this is where the album makes Mos so ahead of the game.it starts strong and eachother track builds with beautiful beats and Mos recognizing life.i love all those songs over and over.premo and mos on Mathematics and the lyrics to Love all make me feel this album."
2,"Buy the track ""Hip-Hop",Just buy hip hop and maybe booty lady or whatever is the name of that other song. It got old after on a few listens and the beats were so wack on some of the tracks I didn't even listen to all of it really.
2,What the bloody hell?!?,"""Black on Both Sides"" is an incredible disgrace to the rap community indeed! Mos Def does not throw down any ill beats, or jumping tracks as his name indicates! In fact, the reason I bought this bloody album was because his name sounded quite crunk in itself.No no no!""Ms. Fat Booty"" isn't even club worthy my fellow rap fans! It's a bleeding horrible album, I couldn't find anyone who would want to dance to this!I gave it 2 stars only because Mos has really nice side burns, I shall attempt to grow the same because of him.-Christopher"
3,Check Brain at Door,"This is the most mindless of ABC albums. Yet, if you buy their act (ultra-sharp production, glamour, etc.) this is at least a good travel tape. And it has humor too - ""50 Story Halo"" (as in ""my woman has a ..."") is a riot! If you want more serious and gorgeous stuff, you're better off with ""Alphabet City"" or ""Lexicon of Love"", but this is at least a good commerical for an ABC album!"
2,"Come on ABC, make another masterpiece!","As ABC's third album, it didn't go too well with me and that's just my opinion. 'Zillionaire', had it's hits like ""Be Near Me"", ""Ocean Blue"", ""Vainty Kills"", and so on. But some of the songs are just so cheesy, they're not worth listening to. Eden, the member who degraded the band's image with her disgusting remarks and sleazy persona. She has discouraged me from keeping around any ABC merchandise from that era! I only recommend this album as a collector's item. Otherwise, save your money!"
4,My name is Eden...,"Yes, Eden's vulgar comment in the song 'A to Z' is included on this release. Various vinyl and CD releases over the years sanitized it. If you are a purist or just puerile, then this is the Zillionaire release you want for your collection. This is not the zenith of ABC's craft but you can flesh out your 80s collection without buyer's remorse at a very reasonable eight bucks."
1,stopped working after a week of almost no use,i had this shredder for a week put about 10 peices of paper through it then it just died .. it'll be cheaper for me to buy a cheap shredder then it will be to pay the postage to send this one back and hope the replacement works
1,DEAD ON ARRIVAL!,I ordered a replacement. But this first shredder was completely dead on arrival. Plugged it in and nothing. Also there were a lot of finger prints on the metal sensor guard and fine scratches like this had been used before. Is Fellowes selling refurbished units as new?! This better stop if it's the case. Also my AC plug had on of the prongs slightly bent and the rubber piece where the basket sits had come off already in the box. The box was pretty banged up too when it arrived. Here's to hoping my replacement will work like it's supposed to.
1,Died in less than a year,"I liked the appearance of this unit. It certainly had a hard time with 11 sheets. But six months after purchase, an interanl switch (the one that automaticaly turns the unit on when paper is inserted) broke, and even manually turning on the unit wouldn't work. Definitely NOT recommended."
4,It's great..... but....,"This is a wonderful product, however, if the plastic bag/liner is not lined up exactly, the shredded paper falls behind and onto the base... SO, by putting a cardboard piece between the falling shredded paper and the bag/liner.... there is much less errant shredded paper to pick up after..."
4,Better shredder,"We bought the DS-1 shredder to replace a shredder that finally gave out on us. Of course, we like the fact that it is a cross-cut shredder and not just one that cuts paper into strips and has the power to cut up even credit cards and CD's. What is new for us is the, ""safe sense"" to keep your fingers from accidentally being caught in the shredder and easily removable tilt-out mesh basket that is easier to see when it is full. With this model we don't have to lift the shredder motor off the top of the basket to empty it."
2,Not Good for Business,"My boss wanted this same model again after the one they had died after three years. It was the thought that if it lasted three years, it was a good shedder. To me, that is the only ""Pro"" to this model. It does not take more than 5 sheets well when it says it takes 11. It is VERY NOISY! I cannot run it when management is here and I have a lot of shredding to do. I would say I do a medium amount of shredding and my pile always outlasts the motor's time limit. The basket is very small and fills up VERY quickly, pulling it out to empty is extremely messy as the basked does not fit snuggly and the paper goes behind it no matter how hard you try to keep the basket in tightly. Additionally it is akward to turn over and empty into a bag. For the price there are a lot more machines that take more paper at a time, have much bigger baskets and are not as loud as this one. I would not recommend it for anything more than home use."
4,Sequel stands on it's own,"For what it's worth, Grease 2 is a lot of fun. I was haunted for weeks after seeing this movie in the theatre by Michelle Pfieffer's ""Cool Rider"". The album has other great songs such as ""Back to School"" and ""Who's that Guy?""I met Lorna Luft a few years ago and she said that she had fun making the movie and her kids love it when it comes on TV.Grease 2 may be a ""guilty pleasure"" but what fun. We cant be highbrow all the time...."
3,Solid and amusing music,"While I don't think this CD or the movie are as good as the original ""Grease"" - it is still very good. I especially like that this music has so much humor in it. It never fails to make me smile when it plays."
5,"My mom babysat ""Sharon""","My mother used to babysit ""Sharon"" Maureen Teefy, the one who sang ""Let's do it for our country"" with her boyfriend Goose or Gooch whatever his name was?It is a great movie I still prefer the first one but this is good too.My favorite songs are ""Reproduction"", and ""Love will turn back the hands of time"",and ""Score tonight""!Great campy movie and equally great soundtrack:-)"
3,The Sum of it's parts?,"Grease 2 was a dud, but it's score swims considerably better without the rest of the film dragging it under. While the handful of tunes do little to evoke the nostalgia of the 50's the way the first film's score did, they're catchy and fun to sing in the shower. A few of the songs have nothing much to do with the plot, but it's when the music allows itself to get fun and raunchy, like on my personal favorite Reproduction, that it soars most."
1,This book is ridiculously credulous,"I picked this up in hopes that my 7yo daughter would get something resembling a responsible review of bigfoot/nessie-lore. Alas, upon a quick reading I won't be passing it on to her as it is far too much of a ""true-believer""'s book. I didn't expect it to be a scientific treatise on the subject for second graders, but I would hope for at least a little critical thought. As an example, it says of the Patterson footage ""Some scientists believed it was a fake, but they couldn't prove it."" which is not exactly representative of the scientific consensus regarding most of what passes for evidence in the Bigfoot realm.I want my child to read to her interests and at her level, which this is, but I don't want to encourage sloppy thinking, which this does.I really should have used the ""Look Inside"" feature (though it's limited in a short book such as this, it would have given me a clue)."
3,SoSo,This case looks much better on Amazon than it looks in person. The outside fabric will pick up dust and just looks cheap.
5,Absolutely amazing!,"I've been into the topic of Tutankhamen for years now, but only recently stumbled on this book while doing research for a specific paper. It was incredible! Brier sets the scene for Tut's life and death perfectly, and reconstructs all the evidence into a plausible and convincing theory. I couldn't put this text down once I started it. It filled in all the gaps about this period of Egyptian history I'd ever had. If you're a Tut fan and haven't read this book yet--what are you waiting for? :)"
1,NONSENSE,DANGEROUS BOOK THAT CAN EASILY MISLEAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NO BACKGROUND IN EGYPTIAN HISTORY.
4,A good read with lots of info about royal life at the time,"A compulsory case, if one accepts the belief that the skull shows evidence of trauma. Even if this is not true, the book is still packed with info about life and death, traditions and beliefs, and love and intrigue in the royal family. Makes these ""name only"" individuals come to life in full color. Amazing how much the Egyptologists know about these people from rings, drawings, few writings, and artifacts."
2,Not Impressed,"No substitute for a visit to a Devon Family History Centre. The records are very superficial and very incomplete. I have no confidence in information contained as I have not even been able to find names that I have already extracted myself from the parish records. The search engine is primitive. Might just as well have used the windows ""Find"" utility."
4,What A Blessing!,"I bought this book ($25 or less) at Bishop Bonner's church, Refuge Temple, in Columbia, and it has been a blessing, and oh what a blessing! The miracles that God has worked on his behalf, the trials he overcame, and the lessons he learned bring so much light to what a person goes through in their own life. I have met him, sat under him in classes, and asked him questions, and the sincerity, consecration, and straightforwardness that he displays in real life comes through in the book. There is a powerful anointing on him and in this book, which is his testimony, and I thank God for leading me to buy it!"
4,UDI,M-Sane is one of Sac's most underated talent's. His flow is a like a combination of Too $hort & E-40. This album is definetly worth checcin out. It's not a great album. But a very good album. Better than 99.9% of rap that comes out today. It's too bad M-Sane seems to have fallen off the face of the earth. I would have liked to hear more music from him. . .
1,Waste of money and not even the product advertised.,I order two Powersonic PS-12180NB batteries sold by eComElectronics on Amazon. What they sent me were two ub12180 from another manufacturer (which can be bought cheaper on eBay). The batteries charged and seemed to be working fine but after the first charge neither battery would charge in the device I bought it for nor would they charge out of the device on a battery charger. I notified eComElectronics and they did not respond. Complete waste of money and not even the product advertised.
2,Dies after a year,"This register is slow and painful but that I could deal with. The fact that we have had two in a row die after a year of use pretty much says it all. In the meantime it does very odd things that make no sense. It is very unreliable. If you don't need to use it much, I am sure it will be fine."
3,aokay,"This cash register is well designed for a small use service like mine- It could be a little faster, but all in all, it is perfect for our use"
4,A good cash register for the money,"It's a good cash register for the money. I own a season Christmas Tree farm. I have an outdoor lot. It is often cold and sometimes wet. I need a cash register that will work well in less than favorable conditions, but I don't want to spend a lot on once because I know even the best ones will eventually die in the nasty conditions.So far this season the register is working well. On days often only in the upper 20s the register worked well. Other registers I've had stopped working because of the cold, but this one kept working.Programming is simple It comes programmed with basic tax and tax-free departments. All you have to do is program the date and time and tax rate, and all is ready! Other registers I've had recently you have to program the tax rate for each and every department which can take forever!The only complaints I have is that the printing is a bit slow and you can't make receipt copies. Other than that this is a good little register for the money."
2,Not very accurate.,"This was a very dissapointing purchase. If you need precision this isn't for you.1. The flip stop has too much give in it. Depending on how much pressure is put against it it can move +/- 1/16"".2. The short lengths of rail cause the stops to not glide smoothly up and down the fence.3. Despite all my effort I cannot dial the system in any better than a short 1/32""When I adjust it dead on at 90"" it's off at 30"" by 1/32"" not due to user error.I'm a professional woodworker. This system falls well short of the mark."
3,cute,Very cute.. but nothing you cant get in an american asian market. I was a bit dissapointed but it was a huge hit at my brother's birthday party anyway.
2,Re-Recordings,Another missed opportunity to combine his Warner and BNA sides. These are all re-recordings.
1,Garbage and misleading. Re-recordings. Not original,"Avoid like the plague.These are re-recordings.Total garbage.It's times like this I wish Amazon had a ""zero"" stars choice."
5,Great cookbook for kids!,The pictures are big and enticing for the kids. It really encouraged my child to pick out some recipes to try. The directions are simple yet clear to understand. The several recipes we've tried so far have tasted great.
5,Sterling,"You may ask yourself why you need a recording of the Etudes in somewhat tubby monaural sound, when there are excellent modern versions by Lortie, Perahia, Biret, and, across two CDs, Freire. Well, this is Arrau at the peak of his virtuoso years for EMI, when his interpretations were less worked over than they became during his Philips years and featured an absolutely exquisite piano tone and technique of execution. Don't get me wrong: The later Arrau remained a fascinating artist, but for the Etudes, Arrau's earlier incarnation was almost ideal. Not that this is barnstorming playing; Arrau can be very subtle when he wants to be. This is some of the most poignant Chopin playing in the catalog, in addition to being technically outstanding. If you have been deterred in exploring Arrau's Chopin by his opulently indulgent versions of the Concertos with Eliahu Inbal, there is no need for any reservations here."
2,THE WORST CIO CIO SAN EVER,Ms. Ying Huang is so dull and old. Madame Butterfly is a teeage girl. Ying Huang acts like an old woman. Her singing is dull. I can't stand it.
4,Madam Butterfly,"This is a beautiful production and I love they have used a young Oriental woman instead of a much older Caucasian woman! Yet I also felt something was missing...I'm not sure what. Maybe the voices aren't as strong as I have heard before? Or not enough passion? I really did like it, but having had seen other versions of Butterfly, I was left with a 'wanting something that wasn't there'."
4,Great Customer Service,The customer service is wonderful. The book was not what I expected and the company was very quick to reply and took care of my concerns immediately. I would use them again.
1,Please Stop!,"I am a real fan of Turtledove's books, but this series is flawed. Whereas the Worldwar-series was interesting in mixing WW2 with an alien-invasion scenario, the extended Colonisation-series seems to be just a drawn-out afterthought. Quite silly and after some time plainly boring. I stoped reading after 200 pages and I will neither continue nor buy any other book from this series."
3,Tactical way of closing the sale.,This book does NOT talk about HOW TO close the sale. It talks about the system of closing the sale. From making cold call to closing the sale.Good idea for Sales Managers. Somewhat easy way of organizing your prospects/clients. Read it. It will clear few clouds for you and answer questions like: How can i manage my clients better.
1,Frenetic paced drivel,"What a waste of time for this author, since she did so little writing - a few sentences on this, a few sentences on that - where was she going in such a hurry? The pace was a mistake, the material was never fleshed out enough to mean anything. Waste of time for the reader too."
3,"Jon & The Nightriders ""Stampede""","This cd is very good but I was hoping it would be a little more ""in your face"" 'Live' over-the-top surf music. But it is good and I'm glad I bought it.)-("
5,Not For The Weak Minded or Hearted,"Mental vortex was the technical apex of Coroner's recording history. They started seriously broadening their horizons with the addition of samples and ambiance to lend the songs here a more diverse feel, like the intro to Conspectu Mortis and the chorus noise of Pale Sister. The playing is as always, something to listen to and learn from. The bass could have been brought up in the mix a tad, however.But the songs are pretty much all cut from the same killer cloth, with these guys packing in more riffs in a minute than typical 'nu-metal' bands packed in a whole album. I always appreciated their intellectual lyrics, which when wedded to their thrashy and juicy riff-laden music makes for crazy musical children. This is thinking man's metal at it's finest."
4,It's not as bad as it first look's.,"I have just watched this film on the Sci-Fi chanel and I actually liked it. Okay it's low budget and there are no CGI effects ( a definaite bonus ) and it is so obviously a pilot for a tv series which has yet ( or never) to appear. But the acting is good to okey and the film over all is enjoyable to watch. I have never watched the Fury or Scanners but it does seem very similiar to a story I once read. It was a Babylon 5 book on the story of how the Telepath's and Bester came to be.Also if your a big Twilight fan one of their short's also follow's a similiar idea of a small group of special people consantly on the run from the goverment who want to kill them.However Momentum is still a good film to watch, and I intend to buy it."
4,Not a bad effort,But not the place to start your NRBQ collection.Must have for the major NRBQ fan who needs all CD's by the band as I do.The boys have done better but hey they can't have a million seller every time out!
5,american ginseng,"Ecellant product, excellant delivery time. Wish theyhad a catolog in english instead of chinese."
3,There must be more to life then this,"Unlike some of McGilligan's other subject's, this book is titled somewhat innapropriately as there's some life in the old dog yet. There's evidence that he researched the first 57 year's of the actor's lfe pretty well, but the resulting portrait leaves Jack as enigmatic as the famous grin McGilligan seems so fascinated by. The tone is often sensationalistic, particularly when he argues that Jack my be reading of his possible illigitamacy ""for the first time here"" Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable read, though I didn't feel I knew Jack any better when I turned the last page, and was more enlightened about 70's Hollywood by Jack's friend Robert Evans, Robert Siskind, and others."
5,Jack Nicholson Bio,The shopping experience was pleasant and painless (as always) and the item was purchased as a Christmas gift. The recipient was very pleased.Keep up the good work!Joe
5,Great protection for your wheels and tires,McGard supplier of OEM locks makes the best wheel and tire protection lock nut. They are on all of my vehicles to prevent theft or vandalism of expensive wheels and tires. Just tighten them with a lug wrench and never use air tools to tighten/remove them.
1,Weakest Natas Album,"I'm not one to bad mouth a tight group but this is the weakest NATAS cd out there. If you want to hear a real NATAS cd buy the album Multikillionaire, it's the best one trust me. But If you want a newer NATAS cd get Godlike, it has some pretty good songs. Even ESHAM's Dead Flowers cd is bad ... Take my advise if you like hard/gangsta rap."
4,This is a great power pop LP way ahead of its' time.,"This LP combines the best of witty satire and great if not terribly original hard rock. All of the tracks are strong with the exception being a completely unnecessary cover of ""I Got You Babe"". Nevertheless, Shernoff's vocals are very distinct (Manitobs, despite being the lead singer does not appear on lead vocals all that often) and Ross's guitar simply rules. While their two later LPs were more concise and better produced, for pure partyin' rock and roll fun, this is about as good as it gets."
5,this aint first,"da brudas got together in 74 so maybe they really did make original material before the dictators. now i feel like i gota find out who was first but why the hell should i care. those bastards tricked me. Maybe it was Marcel Duchamp, one of the three most prominant artists of the 2oth century he wore a dress in the twenties before body piercing existed except for earings on girls and pirates."
2,A Chore to Read,"This book is just not working for me. I am in the middle of The Farewell, and I'm not at all sure I'll finish this book.While this is all good information, I'd have to say that Ellis simply is not a good storyteller. I'll be avoiding Ellis in the future."
1,not good,this book was by far one of the most boring books i have ever read in my life. do not purchase it.
1,Euck!,"This book was boring as anything. The writer goes off on meaningless tangents that are incredibly off topic. No only is this book dull and uninteresting, there are huge amounts of unneeded information that just serves to make this book an even longer torture."
2,Incredibly Boring!,"I had to read Founding Brothers for my AP US History Class as summer reading, and it took way too long to finish this. I would sit down to read it and get bored 10 minutes later! There is no real structure in the book, which makes it harder to follow and read.The first 10 or so pages are somewhat interesting, but then my eyes start to fall asleep. The chapters are over 40 pages, so you can see why I had a hard time reading this. Also, there is no real action. It just keeps repeating boring history over and over again. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 was because the first 10 pages are decent.After reading it, I can say that I wasted a ton of time reading things I will never remember. I would have been better off going on wikipedia and researching the topics and reading summaries.Overall, DO NOT read this book if you do not have to! SOO DAMN BORING! NO Action! No Excitement! Barely any conspiracy or mystery! Just an all out bad book!Hopefully I helped you! :)"
4,"Well done, but lacks detail of subject except for beginner","Joseph Ellis is a top scholar of the ""founding fathers"" but it seems not of the 20th century. One of the reviewers--a John W. Morrissey of Downers Grove, IL has written a review that has nothing whatsoever to do with the book, but is a personal attack on Mr. Ellis standing as a historian at all. This is strange as I have yet to see an established historian that hasn't praised his research or writing (and as historian by avocation for 50 yrs. and a retired professor I suspect JW is a frustrated teacher/""intellecutal"" himself). Incidentally, the Boston Globe writer of the major story was interviewed on CSPAN and let slip his political bias, which makes HIS writing suspect."
5,great!,starts off and flows thru out with a wonderful flow. Strong visual imagry is constantly generated by the descriptions of..
4,Adams and Jefferson Worth the Read,"Not a great book but certainly a well written and thoughtful one. The early chapters on Hamilton, Burr, Washington, and Madison are interesting. However, for good storytelling and at times inspired observations buy the book for the last chapter on Adams and Jefferson. It left me concluding how remarkable it is that all the pieces came together and how these two very different personaltiies were able to articulate and build the foundation of the USA. Well worth the time and purchase price."
5,Great Book on the Early American Revolution,Ellis does an excellent job of introducing his readers to the main characters of the American Revolution. His treatment of the characters and how they related to each other is a fresh approach at the history of America. Ellis has an excellent way of writing and is easy to read. A great book for anyone interested in just how this country got started.
5,A Look at the Relationships Between our Founding Fathers,I believe that Joseph Ellis did an excellent job with this book. He takes a look at some of the relationships between the men who were major contributors to our independence. Ellis does not shy away from some controversial events such as Thomas Jefferson paying a editor to slander President Washington. Such instances as these are avoided by many authors and it is refreshing to view a realistic representation of these icons. The book is a very enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in our founding fathers.
3,Left leaning.,"Interesting read overall. I found it to be left leaning, but still had great incite on the founding fathers."
2,More Revisionist History,"Ellis continues his attempt at reviling Thomas Jefferson (why??) along the lines of his Sphinx. He joins the common refrain (McCullough 's ""John Adams"") of demeaning Jefferson but with the uncanny ability to read the minds of Washington, Adams and Jefferson!Perhaps a reading of Ellis's mind regarding his true Vietnam experiences is in order."
1,Worst book ever,This guy's writing style is horrible. He delibrately uses large words in order to make himself sound smart. I hate that. This man has made this part of history even more boring than it already is.
4,What's not to like?,"A concise, enjoyable story-style recounting of the American Founding Fathers from a human perspective. It's a quick, enjoyable and entertaining read."
3,"Yes, winners write our history","There are many who will benefit from reading this work and glimpsing the chaos that the era experienced. There were no TV reporters. Ellis does well with this. We need to understand. There are moments when a few key people decide the course of events. We know of assasinations that have changed events or prevented change. For a zesty historical novel, I recommend Defenders of the Holy Grail by Ken Agori. You will see what courage can do!"
3,Worthwhile but read with an open mind.,"Ellis' book is a highly readable account of a few of who he sees as the most important men of the time. With all the recent attention on David McCullough's biography of John Adams, it's interesting to note this earlier book also attaches a great amount of weight to Adams' role at the expense of Thomas Jefferson. I found the book interesting as a primer on the roles of the six men in question and it made me want to read further into the lives of Adams and Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr especially to see if the biases in their direction are well founded. While an enjoyable read, I kept feeling that there was more to the story that the author was presenting. If the average reader wants an intro to this early time in our history it's a good beginning...but be forewarned, it WILL make you want to explore further into these men's lives."
2,Founding Brothers,"I have recently joined a book club at work. We decided to read fiction one month, non-fiction another month. Our first non-fiction was Founding Brothers. Most of us did not make it through the book. Those of us that did plow through it felt it was interesting, but the writing was more ""text book"", making it a difficult read. We were all amazed at what we learned about history (different than what we learned in school). I would repeat what another review said in that this is a book for those sincerely interested in history, and perhaps with a little more background than a beginner."
4,More academic then I was hoping for,"While informative, this book was a little difficult to read, especially in the first few chapters. The first chapter on the duel between Hamilton and Burr was too heavy on historic details, but was interesting nonetheless. The chapter on the political and personal relationship between Adams and Jefferson was excellent. The clear understanding I came away with is that even the ""founding brothers"" acted like and were politicians. Something I hadn't considered before reading the book and a fact that puts todays partisan politics in perspective. Better to argue with words in a legal framework than with guns in a battle. I'd recommend this book for those interested in politics and history, but its not a good one to bring on the plane. It requires concentration and thought to read and understand."
5,The Best Ever,"If you are really want to know what the 70's was all about you need this CD. It says it all. Stayin' Alive, Saturday Night Fever, etc..Highly recommended."
2,The CD sound is not,This digital re production of one of the greatest movies of it's time does not live up to the original recordI was disappointed. Don't waste your money
4,Staying on beat,"Saturday Night Fever (""The Original Movie Soundtrack"" album): OK, I'm not a big Disco fan but for a while, if you wanted to meet a chick, you had to hit the disco floor...I confess my limited participation was for that reason. Yes, I did ""The Hustle"" (not found on this disc) and I do confess having a good time! This is not great music but it is fun music. Historically speaking, believe it or not, Disco music is the direct predecessor to Rap Music (wrap your noggin around that one!). Overall... ""It has a beat, it's easy to dance too, I give it a..."" Four"
5,Admit it...you like Disco,"If you're actually reading reviews of Saturday Night Fever, then lets face it...You like disco. Disco is funky, it makes one want to get down and shake the ol' booty. The best part is, unlike today's dance music, not all the songs have the exact same beat. So buy the CD, before you spend the money on some cheesy trendy CD that you'll hate in 5 years. This piece of audio magic should be a staple in every human's CD collection."
2,Hasn't aged well.,"Boy this one was BIG. It has not aged well and about half the songs on this CD are totally forgettable. Even the great ones are intollerable to listen to more than once in a month. If you use your programmer on your CD player to rub out about half the songs, you can pump it up to 4 star level.Nevertheless, if you're a student of rock music, you've got to have this as it is THE defining album of the Disco era."
4,stayin alive is my jam,the movie was a little corny but I can tolerate the tracks on here I do remember the 70's and stayin alive and more thaN A WOMAN are my joints on here sister sledge's he;s the greatest dancer is a smash too and can't forget the trampps disco inferno the good old days.
1,It's a piece of cheap plastic,"I bought this thing for my grandson,8 years old.He is totally into Star Trek.It looked real good on the picture,but when I got see it in real,it was another matter.Talk about cheap crap! It shouldn't have cost more than 10 bucks.I can't believe they have the nerve to charge 100 bucks for it.I've sent it back,and got my money back.Star Trek The Next Generation Starship Enterprise Collector's EditionI see by this link,they already dropped it by 20 bucks since Christmas.If they drop it another 60 I might buy it."
3,wore out quickly,"I've owned the shoes for less than 2 months, worn them a total of 10 times. Very comfortable shoes...great price. but the outside part of the shoe ripped along the seam, which I was quite disappointed about."
4,an ironic delight of a movie,"I first saw the movie when I was 17 years old and was smitten immediately by its dark, perverse humor, and especially the performance of Martha Raye. It is worth buying just for her performance alone, a classic of comedy. Some of it seems a bit awkward and not smoothly done, such as the speeding wheels of the train to indicate travel and time passing. And some of Chaplain's shticks such as the way he counts bills seem a bit gratuitous but these flaws don't do much damage to the whole. One of Chaplain's best if not the very best."
5,You make me feel so good,"I bought this album when it first came out on 8 track and their were 2 songs that I loved-You make me feel so good by Ian Gillian and Martian Landscape by UFO,when you heard the Synthesizer and or Orgon on headphones on these 2 songs well all I can say was I was alot younger and it would give my buzz a boost.I found UFO's and the only place I found You make me feel so good was on Ian Gillian's Rarities 1975-1977 which was different but sastifying for all these years till tonite,thanks Amazon and I-Phone(iPod)ya'll brought back my childhood Thanks,and as far as my opinion goes both of these song are G R E A T songs,again my opinion only......"
5,Excellent introduction,"I was a typical ""I'm not a wine person"" person until a few friends introduced me to some tasty wines. I then bought this book and it completely enhanced my appreciation of wine. Wine for Dummies didn't make me a wine expert (I don't know that I'll ever be one), but it gave me a solid basis for at least knowing how to appreciate wines by terroir and varietal (and even just knowing what those words mean!) and furthering my excitement of this wonderful hobby. I look forward to many more fabulous tastes and furthering my knowledge on the subject. If you don't think you're a wine person, buy this book and at least give it a chance - it could change your perspective on food and give you a new appreciation of life forever!"
5,Love it,"Smells great, and isn't over powering. I was happily surprised it also came with a small bottle of hand lotion."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased the perfume At Macy's, later saw it on Amazon for half the price. I thought it to be a ""no-brainer"". So I returned the department store one & ordered the one off of Amazon! When the box arrived it seemed, at first to be the same. Then I noticed there were 2 slits on the top of the box, covered with silver tape. Opened it, sprayed it. It had a small, hint of a scent. Barely.I've not used it much since I got it, 2 months ago, but after my shower today, sprayed it. Now, it has no smell at all!! NONE!And this item CANNOT BE RETURNED!! Go figure. I rate this -10 stars!"
1,NOT ORIGINAL,"The Versace bought from net company does not seems to be original, when i opened it it looked perfectly fine as it had the same smell as original but now even opening the bottle does not gives you much smell and neither does the smell much lasts on you clothes. This was my first perfumes net purchase, I will prefer to buy this from stores paying little more dollars."
1,Versace Bright Crystal Perfume,"I should have listened to another review that said this perfume is a fake because it's a fake. I read what he wrote about the ""e"" being first on the box- well the picture with the product on-line has the ""e"" first but when you get the product in the mail the ""e"" is not first anymore and the perfume has almost no smell except for pure alcohol. SUCH a rip off! I have bought MANY things from Amazon but will NEVER buy perfume from them again! Way to dupe your customers- you did it good!Uniquely For Her Bright Crystal by Versace Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 oz"
5,Exceeded my expectations,The price was cheaper than what I paid for it at retail. Exactly the perfume/size advertised and arrived within a few days. I would order again.
5,Great Buy,Arrived quickly and painlessly. I could not have asked for better service and results. It was a gift and she loved it.
2,Not A Good jump rope,"I bought this tried it out and it is sooo lightweight that It did not work well, would not reccomend."
4,An excellent post-Soviet film about post-Soviet Russia,"'Brother' isn't the best film about the Chechen war, but it is a good reflection of post-Soviet Russia. Danila, young, geeky-looking but street-smart military clerk is sent home after getting into trouble. He hears from his mother that his elder brother, Viktor in St. Petersburg, is doing well in business. Danila joins him and finds out that Viktor is in fact, a contract-killer. Soon Danila joins him in the trade and is drawn to the underworld... soon killing becomes natural to him... it's a simple plot, but shows the sad reality of post-Soviet Russia...Sergei Bodrov, the beloved young Russian actor (who sadly passed away in an accident) carries Danila's role out well. The music, mostly by Nautilus Pompilius, brings out the mood in the film.The sequel, Brother-2, is more entertaining, but much less realistic. There is plenty of nationalism and anti-Americanism there, but still worth to watch."
4,Movie,"I'm glad US public is getting introduced to Russian culture through its movies. I really like movies with Bodrov, Jr. It's heartbreasking that he's gone. See both volumes of this movie (Brat 1 and Brat 2/Brother 1 and 2), very contemporarty, down to eath and close to the reality of Russian mafia.Also, see some Soviet movies of 1960s-70s-80s. Some are true masterpieces and are admired by many generations. You won't find anything like them."
5,A magnificent symphony and discovery!,"This is my second Braga Santos CDBraga Santos: Concerto for Stringsand it won't be my last! If you respond to the sound world of Vaughan Williams, Walton, Hanson then I'm confident you'll enjoy the music of Braga Santos. Thank goodness for Naxos/Marco Polo for making music of the quality available to the listening public. If he had a chance to be heard in American concert halls, I'm confident the ""major"" labels (are there any left...) would be clamoring for a chance to record his works with one of our great orchestras."
5,Shen is my favotite writter,"The first time I read Shen Congwen's book,I am still a student of high school.The book named ""the simple life"".This book was a little hard to me.But appealed to me.When I went to college,I read his novel ""Biancheng"",The artistic conception make me fall in the border area of drean and poem."
1,You don't know my name,"Well I did not purchase this album but the songs that they played on the radio over and over and over again did not grab my attention. What's up with the song where she sings ""You don't know my name"" Well in that song says ""and when we had our first kiss..."" Well if he don't know your name how did you to have your first kiss. Her writing ability is overated. She can sing alright and play the piano but lyrically she's not representing. But that's just my opinion."
5,Best Album!,"The Diary of Alicia Keys is by far one of the best CDs this year, if not this decade. You would think there would be only a couple good songs like the last CD (I only liked a few on that one), but each one was great. One after another could easily be a number one hit. However, the best song by far is ""If I Aint Got U"" It is my favorite song now, and has been ever since the day the CD was released...it probably will be for a looonnggg time. Once you listen to the song you'll see- you won't be able to stop listening to it. When the song hit #1 on 106nPark it felt like I won because I have loved that song for so long and finally other people realized how amazing it is. If you don't already have the CD, you really need to get it because you are missing out on one of the greatest R&B CDs of ALL TIME. no joke."
2,not so great second time around,This cd sounds like she had a hard time competing with her own first album. She is so talented and it does not show.
5,damn,damn this girl has soul....shes beautiful and also shes a wonderful singer.....great cd.....worth every cent you pay for
1,People....GET REAL!!!,"FIVE STARS, NOT!!! I'm totally disappointed with the latest work of Alicia Keys. I must AGREE with spoiled from Detroit...I waited in anticipation for this CD. So, when, ""You Don't Know My Name"" dropped, I was like...I gotta get this CD. An associate and I ran out on the very first day it was released and we each purchased this CD. After listening to it for a couple of days, we asked each other what we thought of our recent purchase...and we responded almost in unison...I'm not feeling it.If this was a first run movie, I would say wait for the video, or better yet, wait for it to premiere on network television."
1,????,I don't get the fascination. She sounds like every other female r & b singer. On the Karma track she is a dead ringer for JLo.
5,A home run!,This is my first Alicia Keys CD and I have to say she hit a home run on this one. This CD is extremely soulful which I LOVE and I appreciate her freshness and I love her sound...she's very talented. There is a nice vibe about this CD that makes you just want to groove to it. I saw Alicia on an interview and I just love her attitude. She had some great things to say about life in general and I love how she carries herslf as a mature young lady...she's so young with on old soul. Alicia is a TRUE R&B artist and I look forward to hearing more great music from this soulful lady in the future.
3,Keep this diary shut for awhile..,"This album by far is a ok album, but i think that Alicia has way more star power than this. her last album, that was great. it was full of power and emotion. this one has a few hits like track 2 and 5. the other sound almost the same and its hard to market alicia when her sound is a bit off key to what were used to. i think that this album doesnt showcase her full potential and for that i give 3 stars...i have mixed feelings about it."
2,Isn't Wonderful!,This cd is nor very good only ``you know my name`` is good!The first is best!Try Again Girl
2,THE REAL REVIEW,"IF YOU LIKE THE LAST ALBUM, CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL LIKE THIS TOO. IF YOU ARE INTO BORING PREDICTABLE ARTIST CREATED BY THE MEDIA FOR YOUNG ADULTS TO ADORE AS NEW AND FOR THE OLDER GENERATION ACCEPT AS TALENTED RATHER THAN REALIZING THAT THIS FALSE REPRESENTATION AS A NEW MUSIC HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE AND DONE BEFORE AND DONE BEFORE, EXCUSE ME I AM REPEATING MYSELF JUST AS THIS ALBUM REPEATEDLY USES SOUL SAMPLES FROM THE SEVENTIES. DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A TALENTED ARTIST, TOO BAD THEY DON'T LET IT BE KNOWN THROUGH HER REMAKES AND HER SLIGHT PIANO MELODIES AND RIFFS THAT SHE PLAYS OVER SAMPLE AFTER SAMPLE. THIS WHOLE HIP-HOP R&B THING SUCKS. HIP IS DYING FAST WITHOUT THESE SO CALLED "" ARTIST "" HELPING OUT."
5,Amazing!,"I love this album! It's so good! Her vocals definately grow on this album. I especially love ''Karma,'' ''So Simple,'' ''When You Really Love Someone'' and ''Dragon Days.''''If I Ain't Got You'' & ''Diary'' are also 2 beautiful songs! The rest of the album is great too! You'll love it!!!"
3,Burns out after track 7,"Had Alicia released the Diary like this it would have been a classic:Intro- great intro to the albumKarma- love the music and lyricsHeartburn - reminds me of 70's funkIf I was your woman - excellent coverYou don't know my name - great mix of vocals, music, and samplesIf I ain't got you - beautifulDiary- great songNobody not really- excellent album closerThe Diary shouldve been an 8 song EP and it wouldve been a classic soul album. Tracks 8-14 just cant sustain the album."
1,"OMG, What happened to Alicia?","Way over-produced, boring. What happened to the unique style of the first album? Alicia, why did you let this happen to you? I am soooo disappointed. I was playing it while doing chores and forgot who I was listening to. What happened Alicia? I will hope you get back to yourself for you next effort."
1,This Is Just Way Overrated,Alicia is not the worst R&B singer out there. Why does she need great production from people like Kanye West. Whitney Houston in her prime could sing over anything. This album is not for everyone. When people like Whitney were at their best it was hard to hate her.
4,No Sophomore Jinx,"Most artist with a blazin' first album suffer from ""Sophmore Jinx"" where their second album don't even come close to being a brilliant as the first...well I'm glad to say Miss Keys doesn't suffer from the ""jinx"".The ""diary"" is as elegant, soulful, and as good as her first albumSongs in A Minor. She and her production partner Kerry ""Krucial"" Brothers (her partner in KrucialKeys, I'm sure you've heard her say it) have found the right groove for producing great songs. Alicia is definitely in her own groove and that's a good thing where we have all these acts coming out being produced by The Neptunes or Timbaland.I would tell you what the HOT tracks are, but all the songs fall into one of two catergories HOT or seriously WARM. This looks like another classic for Miss Keys, but of course...she's always been a class by herself."
3,She sings and plays the piano,"Okay, I'm not hatin' because Alicia really does have big-time talent. She's singing and playing the piano at a time in the industry when more female vocalists are spending time strippin' and posin' -- tryin' 2 distract you from the fact that they don't have skills.Alicia, thankfully, isn't in that category. Outside of Beyonce, she's probably the next best female artist of the decade.I own this CD and it's not bad, but it's not all that compelling or passionate once you get past her radio singles ""If I Ain't Got You,"" ""Karma"" and the catchy, luscious ""You Don't Know My Name.""I do believe this album is an improvement over her debut CD, but overall this album doesn't tickle my fancy like a Mary J. Blige, Lauryn Hill, Faith Evans, Jill Scott, Janet Jackson or Aaliyah CD.I'm not saying this LP is bad ... just as an LP, it doesn't hold my interest song-to-song."
3,Overrated and Depressing,"I bought this album because of the good reviews in this website. But I found it overrated and depressing, I couldnt bear to listen to it again. I gave it away. Could not care if it landed in the garbage can. I would go for India Arie anytime rather than this one."
4,A very good performance of a rarely heard opera,"Although Giovanna d'arco is not one of Verdi's best operas, it is very enjoyable, especially for opera lovers who want to go beyond the standard operas we hear all the time. This was very well performed and recorded. My only real complaint is that it did not have a synopsis of the opera. For a little known opera such as this, a synopsis would be very helpful for following the story."
3,"for collecting ,not playing",leaving this in the box is best. it isnt really that articulate or accurate. its more of a collectors item then a toy.
1,Where's the information?,"I wanted to look into this system, but was not provided any information. What does it do, what comes in the ""package"", how many watts are the speakers...etc."
5,WOW mind blowing,"I wish I could give this albumn 6 stars. This is the only real Manics albumn, if you cannot decide whether to buy it then you must be mad. I only wish that all their other albumns were this good. After Richey left the albumns go down hill, especially their newest ""If you tolerate this your children will be next"" the lyrics mean nothing compared to the ""Holy Bible"" or some parts of ""Design for life"""
5,Beautiful fury,"""I know I believe in nothing but it is my nothing"". A line from their debut album ""Generation Terrorists"" which sums up their ""philosophy"". I couldn't believe that ""nothing"" could be so much. Eternal sadness, beauty, violent fury, self-contempt and some very personal politics. The lyrics to ""4st7lb"" is exploding in my head - this must be heard...."
1,Doesn't explain the behavior of the Feds,"One question that isn't answered is why -- if the Feds wanted David Koresh so much, and if they wanted to ""protect the children"" as they have claimed ad nauseum -- they didn't arrest Koresh when he was in Waco relatively alone, as he traveled there quite often (and without a lot of people with him).Doesn't make any sense to me . . . If I was going to stop someone that was allegedly as depraved and as dangerous as he is now made out to be, then I would wait for him to leave the ""compound."" The Sheriff of Waco, among many others, have said that Koresh had traveled into town quite frequently (and no, he didn't surround himself with human shields). He would have been easy to arrest without fanfare.The Feds instead chose to bring in a whole ""battalion"" of folks and create a big media event.Personally, I wouldn't trust what this guy says in the book."
4,good burger,"My kids love this film,it has a real good feel to it,although very manic this film will make you laugh.One for kenan and kel fans."
5,Stupidly awesome,"Lots of people would say this movie is just stupid, but I think it's hilarious. I've watched it over and over again, and I laugh every time! Love it!"
5,Great Flick!,Good Burger is a great old flick. It will become history for us kids and I have at least 32 friends that say it should be in the Hall of Fame Movies. I loved it! Kel Mitchell steals the movie as the always loveable Ed! Kenan is good but not as good as Kel! So good job Paramount and Nickelodeon and Also Kel and Kenan you both and the rest of the crew in Good Burger deserve a million thumbs up!
2,Where's the index?,"This book seems to be a compilation of two other books, namely one on miso and one on tofu. However, the publisher didnt' see fit to re-tool the book, with the result that a directive in the book for a page number (e.g. see p. 54 for this or that) doesn't match up with the actual page number in the book itself. And the index is no help either, as the page numbers there don't match up with the actual pages. The book is okay if you're interested in the manufacture of these two products, but the recipes are a little too far-ranging and odd for my taste."
3,Historical Soft Machine's recordings with bootleg quality sound,"This Compilation bring us recordings from 1967 and 1968, both belong to the trio formation of Ayer, Ratledge and Wyatt. The 1968 recording (Tracks 7-14) are from live concert in Col Ballroom, Davenport, Iowa, USA, 11 August while The Softs were supporting Jimi Hendrix Experience in that summer tour( their second in USA that year); and show us an energetic performance of historical value that could be one of the very few recordings existing from that tour (the last with Ayer). Interesting to hear the embryonic versions of Wyatt's Moon in June and Ratledge's tour the force piece Ester's Noise Job, a real shame that important recordings just have a poor booleg quality sound. The 4 page booklet have a interesting commentaries from former member Brian Hoper and pair of black and white photos. Just for real Soft Machine Fans with historical curiosity."
1,does not work,"I was hopeful in this product when I ordered it. However, it does not work. If anyone out there reading this thinks I am doing something wrong because they love it, then please let me know."
1,dont waste money,i bought this product in an attempt to do at home what i get done at the derm's office during a microderm apprasion. it was lame. i could have gone to target and bought just a quantity of 1 for $3. in this purchase they send you quantity of 2. why would you need 2? plus didnt work for me.
3,My first reading of Dick; I'll be back for more,"This was the first science-fiction-esque book that I have read in some time, and it is quite the mind-bender. Although the pace of the book never seemed to reach its potential, I was intrigued throughout and found myself empathetic to a few of the characters. While the work certainly shies away from the classic conflict/resolution pattern of literature, Dick's interesting and original cosmology and view of Gnosticism are quite compelling and worth the time I spent reading the book. I will definitely be picking up a few more of this man's works."
1,MISSING!!!,"The envelope is broken, nothing inside! the book is missing! I have nothing to return, and this thing makes me have no book to use in tomorrow's class."
4,at last,"Real songs, a real singer in the studio singing WITH musicians - what a relief and what a gutsy album. I should have given Home to Myself 5 stars just for the title track. Got both of them at the same time and it's just great to hear this music again. HTM just says it all for me.Kind of a shock to find The Dixie Hummingbirds are on 'O Heaven' - what a great pairing.I have to agree that they could have included some extra material - notes would help, lyrics would be great but her diction is great you really don't have to guess ""what did she say there?""Ahh, Melissa, so good to have you back in the house....and really loud."
4,Terry Brooks fan and collector,This is another awesome book by Terry Brooks.. This whole series really works with your imagination.
4,"Interesting, though lacking originality","I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Sword of Shanarra"" which I found to be quite interesting and full of excitement. I would have to admit, however, that the book seemed to be greatly influenced by Tolkein's writings, although lacking Tolkeins superior writing style. Many of the characters, places, and ideas have parallels in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Despite this fact, I would definitely reccomend this book to any reader who enjoys fanatasy or just wants to read a good book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Commercial quest fantasy clone blueprint.Elves, dwarves, wizards, ok, druid, but not a lot of sickle and magic potion work, or slaughterning and divination to be seen. You have to have a magic sword as well. Obviously, as a deliberate experiment to see if you could sell this sort of thing it succeeded wildly, and spawned an industry, and a lot of boring books, but so does anything like that I guess. An ok book."
3,"Not bad, not great, but worth reading","As other reviewers have noted, this is not a stellar work of original fiction. Even when I read it way back in 6th or 7th grade I could tell that it was a Tolkien knock-off, but I loved it all the same. It's a fun read, with some really good sections that justify pushing through the more awkward entries. What makes it worth picking up would be the books in the rest of the series. Elfstones is an excellent sequel, and it's there and in Wishsong that Brooks really distinguishes himself as a storyteller and delves into more original territory."
2,The ending is terribly quick,"I though this book was great! It had me reading all the time. But there were a few things I didn't like that might help you... - too wordy - characters traveled across the map too quickly, was almost unrealistic - the ending came within 50 pages and was distastefully terrible I liked the book all except for the ending. I do recomend you read it because you might appreaciate it more than I did."
1,Just awful,"I am an avid and usually not-too-picky fantasy/sci-fi reader, but this book was just awful. Terrible writing, mostly. Also terrible characterizations. And when the hero got ""saved"" from an impossible situation by his magic stone the second time, that was it for me - what, he was just going to pull his stone out every time there was a problem? I could not finish it. Comparing this to Tolkien is just...inexplicable."
3,Fun Story with Flaws,"A lot of the story feels like filler. When the main characters are journeying the same things happen just slightly different. More than a dozen times I thought I had a book with duplicate pages mixed in accidentally.SEMI-SPOILER** There is a council meeting in a city the main characters had to flee towards from dark wraith monsters. In the council you have elves, dwarfs, small men, bigger men, and a mysterious druid who wanders the land. They decide that 7 or 8 of them must go on a mission to save their races. Doesn't this sound familiar?!"
3,Read this and the rest of the Shannara series,"I like some people read Shannara before I read Tolkien. I was amazed by Brook's writing and detail. But when I read Tolkein I was blown away and felt a little disappointment with Brooks for pretty much carbon-copying Tolkein in this book. But after I read the WHOLE Shannara series I began to understand the reason for Sword of Shannara. It sets up Brook's world. Sure it resembles Tolkein pretty closely down to the names. But give it a chance, he wrote it in college and his writing has IMMENSELY matured since then. If you don't believe me, read Elfstones of Shannara. After Sword, Terry Brooks swerves away from LOTR to really progress the series. So I gave this book a 3, but READ the other books and you will never be short of beutiful storylines and great action (unlike other authors we know...cough... robert jordan.. cough)"
3,"A tad unoriginal, but read-worthy simply for the series","I'll tell you what. This book, I believe that it was most-probably written during a time when the classic works of J.R.R abounded, is definitely loaded with ""rip-offs"". Of course, he tried to be original by making Alannon dark instead of the grey (or white, if you will) of Gandalf...but it's all still there. Nevertheless, the book is still a good read, and the next two as well, because it definitely sets up a great series...The Heritage of Shannara. These four books have a definite life of their own which is even more appreciated when you look back at the T.Brooks of his Unorigianl, yet beginning, days."
1,Yuck.,"I'm one of the seven people who didn't like the Lord of the Rings, but I have to say, it's very clear to me why people who did would be unhappy with this sorry imitation. I won't even go into all the blindingly obvious parallels between the this and Tolkien's work. Read the first fifty pages and you'll find plenty of them yourself. And seven hundred pages! God, even Tolkien wasn't THAT long-winded. I'd stay away from this one...."
1,A bad Carbon Copy,I read it in the hopes that it would open the doors to a new world of fantasy.I cannot express the disapointment I felt at every page.It is 100% true that this is a Lord of the Rings bad copy.
2,"Thanks, but no thanks.","This is my third attempt at this book in the last 15 years or so. A friend had mentioned how much he enjoyed it, so I thought I'd give it one more shot.I made it about 60% of the way through, the furthest by far, but I give up. Many people have mentioned that it is a LOTR ripoff, but I don't think so. It definitely has it's similarities, but so do so many books of the genre. No, my problem with it is that it's just plain boring. I simply don't care about the characters and found my mind wandering while reading it.Usually when I get this far in a book I finish it no matter what, just so the time already put into it isn't a waste, but not this time.Life's too short for bad fiction, and there's too many other good books out there."
3,A little too Tolkien to be original,"I read this book because my best friend wanted me to. I then read the two following books. Stick with this one because Elfstones and Wishsong are just a rehash of this one. Throughout the book you are constantly confronted with Lord of the Ring rip offs. It is an exciting story, but the lack of originality in it can not be ignored. There is also a decided feeling of trodding through mud. The story could take out one hundred pages, and not lose any of the story. I recommend it for reading, but it is not in the same league as Tolkien, Harry Potter, or Redwall."
3,"good, not great","This is a Tolkien rip-off. That being said, I was entertained and enjoyed the book somewhat. If you are reading this book, then you know what it is and are expecting the Tolkien type experience. It shouldn't be a surprise when you crack it open."
4,One of the best,"This is a very good fantasy book. It is probably the third or fourth book I read from Terry Brooks. I previously read what now I understand is a prequel to this trilogy and although I don't yet see the connection between this and the Word/Void trilogy I am enjoying it very much.You can read the plot in other reviews, and if you think this is pretty similar to Tolkien's LOR, you are right. Still, there are different twists and quite a bit of action and surprises. Don't feel turned off because of the similarities but be excited about the great differences. Enjoy."
3,It's in there somewhere between original and bad....,"Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed the book, and I did read it all the way through. It's just that several times I found myself laughing aloud, because (as has been pointed out!) this book is exceedingly similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's works. I seem to recall Gandalf, too, falling into an abyss while fighting a large, black-winged creature.... And Durin and Dayel seem remarkably like all the dwarves with rhyming names.The races are indistinguishable except by name, as the psychological characteristics in all are nearly identical. And Brooks seems to toss in background information and story elements as he needs them, without building up to them gradually. In short, although this book is a decent read, I wouldn't recommend spending money on it; borrow it from your public library or a friend. And don't forget to read Tolkien, too."
1,"Please, please. Sick.","Look. I have been a fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings since I was in the third grade. It has been my absolutely favorite book since I first read it. Tolkien's touch was beautiful. And now, I had to read this book. It was odd. Allanon. How like he is to Gandalf. Everything exactly the same. Except for the important magic of skilled writing. They go to Culhaven or whatever. Just like Rivendell. What is Terry Brooks thinking of? People who say that story doesn't matter, even though it is obviously a copy of LoTR (anyone who is mature enough to really read must see it) I must say, who cares if the author is a great writer? Just writing doesn't make up a book. Story is important too. You can't just copy somebody else's wonderful story plot by plot and expect to be called a wonderful writer. If Terry Brooks was just a fan of LoTR, he should have been more subtle, at least, in getting ideas from it. Really, Christopher Tolkien should sue."
2,"Only ""The Druid of Shannara"" is worth reading.","I slogged through all seven books. It's all very formulaic fantasy. In the last chapter everything goes ""poof!"" and the world is back to normal again.Skip the rest and only read ""The Druid of Shannara"". It takes place mostly outside the plot of the rest of the books, and manages to avoid most of the usual fantasy cliches. It has some very original characters, and bit of tragedy mixed in."
3,Good for young readers,"I read this book at 16 and I LOVED it. OK - it is definitely a shameless and direct ripoff of The Lord of the Rings - hence the three stars. However, it is much easier to read and follow so I recommend it to younger readers. I reread it as an adult at 30 and still thought it good, as were the Elfstones and Wishsong. The later Shannara books however are egregious and should be avoided at all costs!!!!"
3,Overrated,"This book is good. Not great, but not bad. It is a little too long, and it is fairly clear that Brooks copied Tolkien. It is true that every fantasy author copies Tolkien a little, but Brooks copies more than he creates. Nontheless, I still think fantasy readers will enjoy it."
4,very good bike for the money,I just assembled two of these and they are well built and have a heavy frame. For the price they are hard to beat. The brakes and derailers needed adjusting but that was no problem. They are a low-end bike but very servicable with nothing fancy.
5,JK2,"Anyone who is anyone will know that Jedi Knight II was an awesome game.You would also know that Raven perhaps created the only good Star Trek game (Elite Force).With all the newly recently released Star Wars games being..., Raven will be our rescue and plunge back the Star Wars games to the top!I suggest pre-ordering this now so that you don't rush to the stores when it comes out.P.S. I'm not 12, I simply didn't want to sign up."
5,Awesome Dude!,"This game is so friggen awesome, I mean, it's just great. So much fun, you might say it's finger-lickin' good. I just love a good lightsaber battle with a Reborn jedi"
4,"Great game, if you can get it to run","This is a very nice game, or so I think from the screenshots that I have seen, and what I have played at the office. I have my gaming PC at home, but I wasn't wise enought to visit the official site for videocard support before buying. I found it extremely frustrating that this game only works on OpenGl supported cards, (most of the new ones do it) but even then, there are only a very few that are supported by JO. My own card is not that old, (a Banshee) and now is left out of the competition. Do yourself a favor and check if you card will actually run the game before buying. Concerning the game, it is a lovely experience. The graphics are sweet, the plot and scenarios are truly Star Wars and even though the game control is a little hard to learn, you'll come around. Beware of long loading times and...cutscenes. other than that, the game we had been waiting for."
2,Blah Blues!,Instrumental tracks are terrific however there are too many poor vocals on this CD to warrant a purchase - aviod!
5,Price too high??,"I own this same Remastered CD, and can't understand why it costs do damn much! I mean, I Love the album, but - why so much??...if anyone wants a copy, please feel free to contact me at this e-mail address: auctionbids121 (at) AOL . com.I Love to share & trade great music! :) I own this + many other rare recordings, and I don't peddle b.s.Peace,Michael"
3,The quality of the discs are flawed.,same as for the new testament. The same as for the new testament. The same as for the new testament.
5,Four Seasons of Summer,"Taking her career to the next level, rather than sticking to the Disco formula which catapulted het to superstardom, Donaa engaged different styles for each track on this, her fourth album. ""Spring Affair"" the opening track, also the album's first single, maintains the disco styling that made her famous. The other 3 cuts range from R&B (""Summer Fever"", ""Autumn Changes""), to Light Jazz (the album's second single ""Winter Melody""), then returns back to Diaco (""Spring Reprise""). Of all of Donna's ballads over the years, I'd have to say that ""Winter Melody"" is the prettiest. It really is a shame that it wasn't a bigger hit."
5,darling,"isn't she? all the way to her tears in the winter season of her calendar. never! get the mp3 of this album. get the CD; it comes with a calendar from 1977 & 4 pictures of donna taken by mario casilli, by then photografer of vogue italy. the picture in the cover with her sitting on the moon is for the summer months. the music is sparkling, the 2 first themes come linked making a 16 minute bonanza of scintillian combo of music & voice. the other 2 songs are good to listen to, not too much to dance to them, but thats only 12 min. bcos. it ends again with the spring sparkling again for other 4 min."
5,Four seasons of Donna Summer....,"The first real disco conceptalbum of Donna Summer reveiling 4 hot disco seasons! This is Giorgio Moroders/Pete Belotte production and Eurodisco at his best! Real smooth and rythmic arragements with erotic and soft vocals of Donna on top. Although the album contains only 4 songs (one reprise) the mood keeps you interested during the whole recording. Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter are displayed at their best. Although a pure disco album this recording can be considered a classic. END"
2,It has some merits...,"A poor book by a renowned author. It struck me as a well written but shallow book, full of sometimes self-mocking but otherwise ever-present snobbery of the sort one would expect a hundred years ago. I read it to the end in hopes of some novel twist or revelation, but was dissapointed when I finished it, put it down and forgot about it- something I did not do with even an awful book like smiley's 'A Thousand Acres' (which at least left a taste in the mouth, albeit an acrid one). This book can be recommended to english majors, as it is chock full of literary allusions from Western literature, and many times over impresses Davies beliefs of the value of a education steeped in literature."
5,a precise definite tour de force from start to finish,"Davies creates the types of Characters who have a firm head on their shoulders but still belong somewhere on the throne of Olympus. his ""supermen"" are just something else. it is the type of life a doctor would like to live forever.mystical,practical and coyful. the book is a dream to be decrypted by the reader."
2,The cunning man,"After I got over feeling that the author was pompous, I disregarded all his unknown (to Me) references and finished the book. Enjoyed the last 25% the most."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the movie. It was to short and left out some interesting things that was in the book. Love the book, dissappointed in the movie. A big let down."
3,"Loved the book, film fell short","I had read the book ages ago, before ""Tudormania"" and so was looking forward to a film of what had been a really compelling book.This ended up a mere costume drama with some overwrought acting from Portman (who is usually very talented and on-pitch), especially at the end, and not enough screen time for Johannson, who is supposed to be the character referred to in the title of the film.Bana is surprisingly good at Henry VIII, and Kristen Scott Thomas steals every scene she is in.The film's pace is so sprightly it is over before we can really appreciate what is happening between the characters, who therefore develop very little, and so we can't come to care about them. In the end, they are just three attractive cardboard cut outs in nice outfits.But it is entertaining enough to pass an hour and a half or so with, and Scarlett and Bana do well with what they have to work with. Loved the scenery and settings too."
4,"Eric Bana is great , Natalie portman outstanding","The acting was great, the storyline tends to be a little boring towards the end...but all in all definitely not a waste of time...Loved the colors...Natalie was wicked & Eric was breathtaking in some momentsIt's an interesting tale about those two sisters...."
5,The Other Boleyn Girl,Great and very interesting movie. It arrived in two days. I loved the movie. Thank you.
1,Good Book turned Horrifying Film,"The book is a page turner that you don't want to put down or pull away from. It sucks you in, in an all encompassing way that's unforgettable. The film is something you want to run away from kicking and screaming. Another Hollywood disaster film based on an incredible book hoping to use the book as a launching pad to lure devoted fans of the book. Everyone from Scarlet Johansson to Natalie Portman to Eric Bana try to make due with the awful film but in the end, none of these fine actors can save this trainwreck of a poorly written adaptation."
4,Enjoyable if not accurate,"Nowadays it seems that the Tudors have been popular for retellings in modern culture (the Elizabeth movies with Cate Blanchett, the TV series 'The Tudors', etc) but unfortunately, this has given people the wrong ideas about the family. I love the costumes for this movie and Natalie Portman does a nice job as Anne Boleyn, but the story itself is not accurate. I did enjoy this film and some of the dialogue and scenes were great, but in my mind, I could not help but pick at the historical inaccuracies which plague so many historical films."
2,Book are still better than the movies,"I was extremely excited after reading Gregory's book that they were going to be making a movie. I was rather hopeful that they didnt butcher it. Honestly they didnt do such a horrible job.The costumes were amazing and very well done. I felt the cast was well-picked although no one seems to get King Henry right. This was my problem with the TV series ""The Tudors"". The movie was almosat historically correct and well realistically the script wasnt that bad. It could've been better,I wasnt disappointed with the movie. I still stick to my opinion that books are always better than movies."
3,Satisfactory,"No matter what you believe is the ""real"" story regarding the Boleyn family, this movie was based on the book by Phillipa Gregory and followed very closely to it. The book is very dense and packed with various events and drama but the movie could only capture but so much in its two hour alotted timeframe and in my opinion it captured the main points of the book. I read the book before I saw the movie and I must say the actors did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. I found it entertaining and well directed. Definitely not a five star movie, but it got the job done!"
4,Blu-Ray Review,"My impression was this particular Blu-Ray was crystal clear on my 50 inch plasma. Every detail of the faces that you'd never expect to notice, I noticed. The clarity was stunning although I've seen other Blue Ray movies that I haven't noticed the clarity as much. The movie itself is not 5 star, but 4 or so."
5,Great movie,Although it is a little off the book it is an altogether great movie!! Enjoyed very much wish.they would make more movies about Henry VIII
5,Watch it twice - and forget the book,"I had to watch this movie a second time in order to appreciate it for itself, rather than continually comparing it to the book. The first time I watched it, I was shocked at how much they'd left out, and how fast the storyline moved forward. I would have rated it 3 stars if I hadn't watched it again.Original story aside, the movie is very well done and the costuming is beautiful. Who would have thought that I'd think Henry VIII is sexy? Nice choice of actor for that role. Watching it a second time, for those who haven't read the book, will allow you catch more of the subtleties (sp?) that explain the actions of the players. They're easy to miss on the first run through because you're following the broader storyline instead.Well worth watching (a couple times) but forget the book and just enjoy the movie for its own merits."
3,They got the sisters reversed,"I read the book first, and then checked out the movie. Of course, I was curious to see the casting, and after learning that Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen were in the movie, I instantly associated Scarlett with Ann and Natalie with Mary. Nothing against either actress, as I think they both have a lot of good qualities, but if I was the one in charge of casting, that would seem the most natural way to set up this film. As it turns out, the reverse is true. A lot of people seem to be unhappy with the casting choices in this movie, and in my opinion, much of this could have been alleviated if only the casting of the sisters had been reversed.Not much point in asking for it now, as it is a mistake that is done and over with. Just a shame when sometimes intuition and art take a back seat to hollywood."
2,The Film..... Boring!,The film was very boring and a big disappointment.I would see it again much less purchase it.
3,somewhat decent representation of the book...,"I thought this movie was a somewhat decent representation of the book. It was hard to dislike King Henry so much this time around since he was played by Eric Bana (whew!). The story was kind of summed up in parts with quick scene changes and long periods of time going by in just minutes. I didn't like that, but you can only do so much with a couple hours for a movie. My one gripe about this film is that the ending concerning Anne and George's relationship and what they did and what happened as a result of it was changed so that we're only led to believe that it may have happened. You don't find anything out for sure, and you don't get as twisted and dramatic an ending as you do in the book. The ending was still dramatic, but I think they should have left it alone. Still, it was a good flick....the love scenes could have been longer or more intense (hehe), but they were satisfactory, too. ;o)"
4,Other Boleyn Girl Movie,"For anyone interested in the working of kings and courts in England under King Henry the eighth, this is a must see. A very human-interest oriented story. Then ending is absolutely glued-to-the-screen viewing. Natalie Portman's exit is absolutely stunning and heartbreaking."
4,If You Liked the Book...,"Then you should like the movie. It does a pretty good job of following the book, which after all is historical FICTION. People often fail to realize that when they are watching a movie they should be watching for entertainment-for factual accounts, watch a documentary. Lord knows that there are plenty out there. I think all the characters were cast well, especially Norfolk. My only historical nitpicks are that: 1. Mary was the oldest (we think, for the most part) 2. Wolsey should have been in there and 3. They make it seem like he hated her from the moment he married her...even before. They could have at least waited until the first miscarriage.Lighten up, history buffs.Just one American's Opinion"
4,I'm in it so I love it!,"Seriously, as a calligrapher located in NYC I am asked for all sorts of advice by my wedding couple clients. Suggestions for places to have event to where to order invitations. This book is a great resource for all to-be-weds, anyone planning a major party event and for all ""in the business"".Joan Hamburg has given information regarding prices and details about services provided that should be helpful for all! Could not find another book like this!"
3,For the Recent Grad Not Experienced,"Good intro, but no new nuggets. Enough to get me motivated again, but the advice is stale especially for a 2003 book. This book was written for the unsophisticated or the new grad. Advice like wear a suit to the interview and send thank you letters are so old hat. I was looking for concrete examples and got none. One suggestion was to include a powerful subject line in e-mails, but she included no examples. It's easy to give advice, but back it up with suggestions. That's what I was looking for. I'm very glad I bought the e-book as it was cheaper!"
5,It's Awesome,It's So cool. Wiping out the other force. Jedis are wicked awesome they can make soldiers on the other side come to your side. You can be 6 different six civilazations. Good graphics for a game of it's kind. It's Awesome.
2,Age of Empires Clone,I was really looking forward to this game for months. Finally a Star Wars real time strategy game with the AOE engine. Boo Hoo-- I was disappointed with this game within minutes. It is too much like Age of Empires. The same old building up of unites and structures as well as gathering resources. VERY TEDIOUS. I think I would have been better off playing AOE II again. Get this - the graphics seem slightly worse than the two year old AOE II. If you want a real time strategy game in space stick with STARCRAFT.
4,My Husband thinks it is a classic,I got this as a gift for my husband. He loves it. It was a game he played as a kid and loves it still the second time around.
3,Cool but not Ground Breaking!,"I, like many others bought this game because I'm a fan of the Star Wars series. THe game had the potential to be a new a and entertaining expirence.At first the characters and new terrains were satisfying. After a day or two though, you realize you're just playing Age of Empires with Star Wars equipment.If you've played Age of Empires, and have already ""OD"" on it, don't bother getting this game. It's practically the same thing.If you hav'nt ""OD"" on Age of Empires, or better yet, never played it, then Star Wars Galatic Battle Grounds should be a great game playing expirence for you.My advice is don't get the game just because it says Star Wars. Think about how much fun you'll recieve while playing the game."
2,Battlegrounds is derivitive and way over-rated,"Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds only redeeming feature is the basic Star Wars theme. For the street price of 44.99 the game is way overpriced, considering you can get the real thing for 40$, that is the revolutionary Age of Empires 2. Battlegrounds feels like a Star Wars mod for AofE2. The game may be worth purchasing for 20 bucks for Star Wars fans. Bottomline: It sucks."
2,What???,Where is the REAL Lake House soundtrack? I know I heard Rosemary Clooney twice while sitting through that movie. She kept me awake!
3,meh.,"I just finished watching the movie and my main problem with the soundtrack is that when the Paul McCartney song comes on in the film, it is supposed to be 2004, but that song is from Chaos and Creation, which was not released until 2005. I love that album, so I noticed the discrepancy right away. Also, there are some great songs in the movie that fit well with the story, but some were left off the soundtrack.Other than that, you've got great songs by Carole King, Nick Drake and The Clientele and there's no doubt Rachel Portman is one of the best and most prolific film scorers out there.An OK addition to your collection if you like filmic instrumental music."
3,Play time fun!,The over all quality of this costume was very good. My grandson was thrilled with it. My only concern was that it has limited breathing space and he became a little breathless after wearing the outfit for a while.
4,Well made costume.,"This costume is very well made (for a costume.) The stitching is good (no holes or loose thread), material is strong & stretchy (comfortable), & my son loves it. The mask is a little hard to breathe thru, but, hey it's Spiderman, it's supposed to be close to your face. My son just lifts the mask up when he wants to. It did come with spats, but I ordered the 'one size fits most' gloves separate. A little expensive, but everything is now days. :) This was a good buy, and I would do it again."
2,a one man wrecking crew,"An Iranian terrorist wants to become a nuclear power, and steals the radioactive material and the scientist needed to build a bomb. Only Nick Carter, American superhero can stop him. Will he? Of course, but as expected by the title, lots of dead bodies litter the streets of the Middle East before its over. This book is written for readers of Soldiers of Fortune who think the NRA is perhaps a little too left wing. Keep in mind it's basically a comic book, and you may enjoy the fast paced action. It's stocked full of gory detail and women who swoon into Carter's arms, just like James Bond."
2,Not up to the Hype,The last version of NCAA football that I owned was 2003 which was great. My friend called me and said how great the game was so I rented it. 2005 added a few items to the game since '03 then but lost a lot in the process. They added a large number of 1AA teams to the game which I like but the memory it used doing it hurt the rest of the game. The gameplay is awful. The varsity level which used to be a challenge in the past installments is a joke (I beat Syracyse with Rutgers 48 to nothing). The biggest issue with the game is that 70% of all passes are dropped. So making a big passing play is almost impossible. I found running the ball to be too easy and my D would always dominate the other team.
4,My Review Of NCAA 2005,"NCAA Football 2005 is slightly better than the previous versions. Its new features has the Stadium Pulse where the visiting team has to drown out the screaming crowds, the Match-Up Stick helps you put your team's ability meters with the opposing team's , and new additions to the Division I-AA teams. I mostly play the DI-AA teams almost every time, my favorites are Southern Ill., Sacramento State, and Columbia. For anyone who is a fan of the NCAA Football series, buy this game."
2,Poco: Crazy Eyes,...audio quality not up to par....had forgotten the only songs I ever liked on the album were the last three.....
2,NOT CRAZY ABOUT CRAZY EYES,I'm dating myself to tell you that I actually bought and enjoyed this orginal release of Crazy Eyes on vinyl(remember that?). In its day it was a groundbreaking exemplification of Southern Rock at it finest. Perhaps it is just that this music does not hold up that well over time. Perhaps it is that so many other groups have more successfully explored this genre since Poco. Maybe it is that this CD doesn't really display a mix that merits 5.1 re-release. The lackluster surround sound mix is extremely bland and nondescript.
5,Great album,"This album includes several of Poco's best songs ever, ""Crazy Eyes,"" ""Magnolia,"" and ""Here We Go Again."" This was Poco's last album with Richie Furay, one of Poco's founders. Be sure to listen to Richie's recent YouTube rendition of ""Crazy Eyes."" It is great!"
5,oh hell yah,"I used to hate country, oh ok you got me i still do but CW McCall is one man you've gotta love. He'll always be one of my favorites"
4,My Redneck Roots,"I think this was the guy who actually invented 'rap'. 'Convoy' came out well before Blondie's 'Rapture', or Kurtis Blow, Sugar Hill Gang, etc., right? (No disrespect, fellas). This collection has some throwaway, stereotypical 'Mama's Dead'-type country dirges, but the genius songs here are the humorous, country-fried-with-homestyle-gravy story songs like 'Classified' & 'Wolf Creek Pass'. An homage to my growing up in 1970's-80's rural-redneck Northwestern Pennsylvania. Ever hear of Townville?(Winner: America's most redundant-sounding place name)"
1,i could have given this 0 stars!,this cd has the WORST SONGS AND THE WORST SINGER! SO UGLY! the other reviews might say it is good but this is so bad! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
4,Lovely Story,"This is a charming story and gets two thumbs up from both of my daughters. The illustrations are reasonably good and I recommend the book.There were however, two small typos which I hope the Author will correct:The Wedding ceremony is referred to as the ""Agha"" instead of Aghd"" and the Persian Gulf is referred to as Persian Sea."
1,Concerned,"My mother just sent my soon to be 12 year old daughter this Bible. Soon after receiving it, my daughter came to me and said that she didn't think that she should be reading it. My husband and I began reading some of the focus stories and were shocked. Romans 16:19 talks about being innocent as to what is evil and wise as to what is good. The focus stories deal w/ a 15 y.o. girl being pregnant, another one is a girl wondering if she is a lesbian, another one wether having oral sex is OK, etc. I know that not all people see this as a problem but if you do, then do not purchase this bible."
5,True Images NIV bible for teen girls,"I would highly reccomend!! I understand some people may not think this bible is suitable for their daughter due to the content written, but your daughter will hear about it sooner or later, maybe she already has. So I encourage you to discuss these topics with her if you do not feel comfortable having her read them alone. You don't want to wait until she asks about them because then she has already heard about it, maybe she wasn't told the truth. I encourage everyone to get this bible! please do not shelter your daughter, I am grateful my mom didn't. I loved it!!!!"
1,Duh,Who would buy this???? No length stated...could be only an inch...who knows....How long is a piece of string!!!!
4,Excellent remakes all around!,"This is not the gritty honky tonk of the sun sessions, but it's not supposed to be. These are 1963 Nashville remakes that are slicker and tighter than the originals. Actually, they are a precursor to the sound that Lewis would come to use on a regular basis (there must be something he likes about it). The thing that brings these sessions together is Lewis' vocals and piano. It's what HE brings to the party that makes all this work. There is not a bad one in the bunch.Don't make the mistake of thinking the Killer isn't present here - he definitely is. Breathless is every bit as good as the original, if not better. High School Confidential moves like a newly purchased Cadillac convertible.My only complaint is that this CD clocks in at a mere 25:15. It's like Thai food. You don't get a lot, but what you get is so good, it leaves you wishing there was more.This is the perfect bookend to the Sun recordings. I say this one is a sure fire yes."
1,Don't buy this CD from this seller. Billy Kain,"Don't get this CD from this seller ""Billy Kain"" cause he will rip you off! But I see he is the only seller who is selling this 4 albums in one collectors CD. That is why I only gave this only 1 star all because of the stuipid seller! I would of love it if I actually got the CD from another seller but this seller is by far the dumbest seller!"
3,Very good condition of cd but...,I received the product In really bad condition and the case was completely destroyed but luckily the cd wasn't harmed and plays perfectly so I'm happy with that. The shipping was very fast though!
3,"It's not a classic, but better than I expected...","This is a solid but non-spectacular album. With the exception of the Simon Says remix, no song stands out to me but I would still recommend this album"
3,fleas,"I was wary of this product at first because it is so cheap but it seems to work fine. just make sure you read the product name: ""once a month flea and tick drops for DOGS"" before you give it to your cat!"
4,Good Sharpener,"I generally sharpen my knives on an old, two-sided oil-stone then trim them up with a steel. This little feller sits in my kitchen drawer and really redoes the the edges. I would stick with the advice to use little force; it may take a bit longer but you will get the edge you want. The edge looked straighter than before sharpening."
1,Avoid This Player,"In addition to turning on the subtitles every time you start a new DVD, pause, skip or go back in a playing dvd, now mine has stopped working entirely. It cannot even pick up on a disk to read it. It seems like a great value, but it is money down the drain."
3,"Good VCR, but it's a little loud","For a budget VCR, this is a good one to pick. The image quality is good and the rewind is super fast. My only complaint is that it's loud. A couple of times I was watching a movie wondering what the humming noise was and it was the VCR. Can get a little distracting. If you have it more enclosed or farther away, you might not notice. And again, the qualiy of the machine is good. I've had it for about four years and have had no problems."
1,Beware of McFarland Alien figures,"I just purchased every Alien figure from McFarland toys. These figures have BIG problems standing up, even the ones that come with a display base. I had to glue this particular figure in place to get it to stand up. Most disappointing was the 12"" Alien figure, which is total garbage. There is no way in hell you can get it to stand upright. Very bad design!"
3,A Little Slow but.........,"Overall the book was ok, it was a bit slow, but then I found myself wanting to know exactly how much Anya would put with...and I couldn't believe it. It's not the best book, its just okay."
1,dont bother,this book is full of conversation and no action. nothing happens. they talk about the situation. dont waste your money or your time!!!
3,Too Unrealistic,"Now, why I will admit there are husband's who have girlfriends, I think this author took it over the top when she wrote about the girlfriend dropping off the love child at the wife's house to watch. What WIFE is going to babysit the child of her husband and his mistress. It just became a bit too unrealistic for me. The wife never went off or really broke down. I know there are women suffering from esteem issues, but that is not the way this wife was painted in this book, so I think there could have been a bit more drama. A real sister isn't going for all of that!"
2,Quite disappointed.,"After reading the back of the book, I thought that the concept was a good one. But after having read the book, I just have to say that I was annoyed with all three main characters. I don't know who I was supposed to be rooting for. In my opinion, none of them were likable characters. I personally wouldn't waste my time."
4,Reccommnd it to teenagers white and American Indian descent,"I read this book when I was a teenager in 1980. I found this book in the school library. I never forgot it. Then some twenty years later, I found it at the public library book sale. So I bought it for keeps. I recommend this book to all white people and Native American Indians. This book is filled with all the emotions a teenage boy of Native American descent would feel. Due to the ending of this story, I would suggest this book be recommended reading as a classroom assignment and then be talked about in a discussion group."
4,Arnold for a New Generation,Arnold was me and my brother's favorite action star. I bought this for my son and he loves it. It's funny because who would think that we would both enjoy something from that many years ago? Looks better on the big screen TV then our small one but great quality either way.
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL HITS.,"In the early 60's, Chuck signed with MERCURY records after having been with CHESS since his beginning. All of Chucks ""charted hits"" (the ones that people remember) were on CHESS. As part of the MERCURY deal, he re-recorded, ""Johnny B. Goode"", ""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""School Day"", ""Back in the U.S.A.""..all of his hits for MERCURY. If you want to hear Chuck's 1963 re-makes of his hits, this is your package. But if you want the original stuff...make sure it's on CHESS."
4,Sounds of the past....,"I bought this CD because I had a copy of the album when I was a kid, and I really loved the late Johnny Johnston's electric piano work, particularly on the song ""Carol"".If you are completely into the original versions of songs, this CD is not for you. But if you like re-interpretations by the original artist(s), well, have a listen to the samples listed above and see what you think. I think this is quite a good effort and is really pretty cohesive as a whole.PS - I think there are actually 2 or 3 more songs on this CD than what was on my album from all those years ago."
5,Bludgening,"One of the best bands ever to come out of San Francisco. Every toon is an audio tour of key and meter manipulation augmented by polyrythems that will satify any audiophile. The melodies are haunting at times, and Andy Liotas' lyrics will take you deep into thought and emotion. Christian Rileys' guitar work is unmatchable. It seems at times he's createing previously unknown keys before your ears. No dwibblie-dwibblie solo's here, rather refracting aggressive lyrical drives to the rythems layed down by Andy(bass) and Joaquin(drums).Joaquins back bonecrushing beats mediates the continuous diatribe of musical and technacal banter that is rarely matched in rock,pop or metal. This trio is going to be truely missed, not only by those who've heardthem, but the thousands who never got a chance. Buy this album if you can find it. It will become one of your favorites."
3,anthropomorphism at its worst,"Like the other reviewer, I wanted to like this book. However, I too couldn't really get past the annoying writing style. Every chapter has a fairly irrelevant anecdote about the author's family life, some strained insight from the field of architecture, and then you get to the very superficial descriptions of the biology which contain more anthropomorphism than I have seen in science writing in a long time. Cells and molecules are constantly running, talking, bustling, angry, confused, grabbing, wishing, etc. I think the 'average' reader could have handled a little more serious treatment of the information, and didn't need this dumbed down version. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wanted to learn about the fascinating area of cell cell communication."
4,A work made at an interplanetary level,"Good second effort. Establishing themselves as an acid jazz with funk-soul alike cuts, it's probably the only Jamiroquai record that has really pace and creates a defined ambience, not only for the lenght of the songs and how they mixed togheter, but because its a deep-dark record.Altough Jay smooth singing style is very notorius, musically the drum-bass understanding is what really makes the diference.The lyrics are very dinamic, going from concrete everyday situations to psycodelic to soul-loving songs such as ""half the man""Nice, elegant and smooth........those are definately the words"
5,cool and funky,"this is certainly the coolest and funkiest jamiroquai album ever. with tracks like mr. moon, the funky yet political track, scam. what else can you ask for.it also has the best jamiroquai track ever... space cowboy. i really love this album that it really rocks! get your copy now before its too late"
3,I hate to admit it but the 4 blade fussion is a lot better.,"What I like about this blade is that they are super cheap these days. I got 30 blades for $35! I used these blades from 1993- 2000 and just went back to them when things got put on a very tight budget at home. Who wants to pay $20 for 4 fusion blades that are just out of hand. Here is the deal that I hate to admit the 4 blade fusion blades do a much better job , when I use the Sensor excels I tend to get cut easily and have a 5 o clock shadow by 10pm. I'm going to use these until the economy gets better but I admit I miss my fusion blades. OH AND JUST AN FYI I was going to try the Mach 3 blades from Amazon since they looked like a good deal but sounds like a bunch of fakes are floating around so watch out"
5,Donna's Magical Album,"I originally purchased this album on vinyl in 1977 when it was released.I was very young at the time,and fell in love with Donna's earlier masterpiece 'I Feel Love',from her 'I Remember Yesterday Album'. I bought the 'Once Upon A Time' album looking for the Euro-synthesizer sound of 'I Feel Love',and found it in songs such as 'Now I Need You','Midnight Shift',and 'Queen For A Day'.I purchased the CD because I wore out the vinyl from listening to it over,and over again. I will purchase yet another CD for my 16 year old nephew as a gift.He has become infatuated with Donna also,after hearing some of the tracks on this CD. I wish Donna would once again record with Giorgio Moroder's guidance. The two create musical magic !!!"
5,Excellent memoirs on Arab & Jewish marriage and divorce.,"Excellent memoirs of marriage and divorce between American Jewish women and Arab Moslem men, dealing with custody differences in culture as parents and adult children seeking core identity speak out on family issues. I highly recommend to all my students this memoirs written in a fabulous novel format with dialogue by a popular novelist, playwright, and behavioral science journalist."
1,Doesn't Even Work,"This heating pad is horrible. When it did work (only for 1 day) it barely got hot. The next day, it simply stopped heating up and instead just blinks incessantly. I would never buy a product from this company again, it was a complete waste of money."
2,"Is slightly undersized and bolt is short, but otherwise OK","The Stopper works well though I had one of three tubs where the stopper would not pull down flush with the tub surface. In that case, I had to purchase a solid body 1-1/2-inch coarse thread stopper that does not make use of a coarse thread adapter ring. Also, the center screw supplied with this overflow plate was not long enough on two of my tubs. Very luckily, the old screw was not too badly tarnished and I was able to use it. Had the old screw been tarnished, I would not have been able to use the Overflow Plate. It is a shame the manufacturer did not choose to make the screw 1/4"" longer."
5,ICE is a sailing adventure you don't want to miss!,"I found this book so intriging, I could not put it down. It is hard to imagine what it must have been like for Tristan to sail alone with only a black Labrador as far to the North Pole as he could get. He gets surrounded and blocked in by ice, and his boat almosts gets crushed by an over hanging ice burg. He pulls his boat free from that danger, but also faces another danger from a polar bear. Tristans writing style is wonderful. He writes in clear detail and with wit and humour. Tristan and Nelson share the same 'strange' meal concoctions which Tristan names, and Nelson licks the skillet clean. This book started me into wanting to sail myself, and I have went on all of Tristans Journeys through his books. His company was a pleasure and has enriched our lives. We miss him. I have collected most all of his books. They will never be missing from our shelves. We highly encourage others to read Tristans books, they can't be missed. Excellant reading!"
3,elementary overview,"This book's intended audience is those without a prior legal background. It is a pretty good overview of how law and politics work together to create the current state of environmental regulation in the United States. The annotated bibliography for each chapter lists some of the better books in each subject area. My biggest criticism is that the author presents every case as a fact pattern/puzzle to be discussed and doesn't provide the outcome or even any relevant legal doctrines. For those with a legal background they could probably look up the case online to find how it turned out, but the intended audience of the book is clearly those without such a background who are probably less likely to want to find the case or to know how to. For a better and more thorough introduction to US environmental law/policy I recommend James Salzman's Environmental Law and Policy, which is accessible and interesting to both lawyers and non-lawyers."
4,I recently purchased a Pat Travers CD,"And there was a review card on this CD in the Pat Travers CD, so I think that I'll get a copy of it and see how it sounds, I was surprised to see that one of the players was once in the band The Law with Paul Rodgers of BadCo fame of which they made only one CD.laughingpig1@yahoo.com"
3,Fair to middling,"As a rule I use a honing steel to rectify my knives, but I thought this product might simplify that task. Indeed it makes it simpler, but the results are not up to par, at least not in my case."
3,Stinky Lotion Massage,"When we do our 3.5 month old daughter's bedtime massages, we sing a made up song about her ""stinky lotion massage"". The Wee Body Lullaby Lotion smells great, but it is a very strong and overpowering smell. We had used it 3-4 times before and it is very smooth and absorbs well. But the last time that I used it on my daughter, her skin got very red. There were no hives, but we still wonder if it may have been an allergic reaction. I may continue to use this for myself, but I think the ingredients may be too strong for sensitive baby skin."
2,DOGGY PACIFIER PINK FOR PUPPY,VERY CUTE ITEM. MY PUPPY LIKED IT A LITTLE AT FIRST & NOW TOTALLY IGNORES IT. IT MAY BE TOO BIG & TOO HARD FOR HER.
4,"How body speaks, which tongue hide.","This book is not a book, it is a live drama, which makes people understand, how body tells you what tongue keep hide of your ears. This makes you enable understanding the language of eyes and body reactions. This makes a person understand how our tongue, language and words are defeated by the true feelings of our soul, which are denoted by the reactions of the body, which is a different identity of the people, who know the art of saying untrue from their second face, they have got in this society but who do not know the soul never say false, and reacts in body -- which is called Body Language."
1,Absolutely no plot whatsoever,"After reading the reviews posted here, and the synopis of the novel, I thought ""Why not, I'll try it"". Don't waste your time. The shooting of a police officer was merely a lame excuse of a plot used to publish a novel that is a complete waste of time. There is no investigation of the shooting, no real man hunt, and the only moment of suspense lasted approximately two pages. Real police work may be frequently dull and routine, but I don't read fiction for dull and routine. The book is about as interesting as watching paint dry."
5,This should be an Oprah Pick!,This debut novel by Morgan amazed and compelled me to an extent which no other book has done in a long time. The character sketch is so vivid that by the end of the novel one feels as if they know these five people on a personal level. I could not get enough of this book.
1,Disappointing !!!,"As someone deeply interested in the writings of people of all colors, lifestyles and interests, I looked forward to getting insight into a bi-sexual African American man's life in modern America. This book was so disappointing !! Although the storyline was facinating and had great potential, the writing style was atrocious - amateurish (like that of an 8th grade expressive writing class) superficial, and full of silly cliches ""The party lasted until the wee hours of the morning,..."" ""When I looked up at him, my mouth dropped open."" ""We tossed and rolled with each other until our bodies seemed to be intertwined."" etc. etc. ....give me a break !! And the author didn't really address how Raymond FELT in a meaningful way ! Harris mentions the internal conflicts, but doesn't say much else. I don't know if I'll read the sequel. Did anyone else feel this way ?!?"
5,Enter Another's Mind,"I have never read a book which actually made me cry. I am not ashamed to admit that this one was the first, and only one since. I applaud Harris' efforts to bring to life the thoughts and emotions of an everyday, bisexual african american, who, just like the rest of us, is trying to find his path. This is my all-time favorite novel, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will not be disappointed."
2,shoddy packaging mars this classic collection,"Having purchased the first set of Chaplin films, we were excited to get this second collection. However, the storage box inside the shrink-wrap was so badly damaged, it was worthless for display and storage purposes. For a collection close to $100 in cost, we wanted the box, to keep the films together and to accompany the first boxed set on our shelf. We reordered twice from Amazon and found the same crunched and punctured box each time. A subsequent purchase via a major chain bookstore yielded the same result, causing this Chaplin-loving family to sit back and wait until the manufacturer wises up and takes better care with the next batch."
5,Chevere Que Chevere,"I consider myself jaded, In this hardcore/metal/extreme niche that I have carved for myself I have seen and heard it all (or at least I thought I had until I heard Sikth. I bought this LP on a whim after seeing the video for ""Bland Street Bloom"" on the Bieler Bros. Records website and I am glad I did. Their sound is an undescribable montage of their influences infused with a unique je ne sais quoi that enthralls the listener and keeps them coming back. If you are into noise core or are mildly psychotic, misanthropic and somewhat homicidal check them out and revel in the utter madness of it all.FUN FACTS6 = (six equals)1. number of members of Sikth2. number of strings on a guitar.3. average length in minutes of songs on Death of a Dead Day.4. 6 + 6 = 12 = number of tracks on this album.5. number of times i heard hype about this band before I finally checked them out.6. the track number of my favourite song on this album."
1,MASSIVE improvement,"when i got Trees by sikth, i was stoked that a band could release something so progessive in a sea of rubbish metal that had been fathered by limpbizkit and mothered by korn.the follow up album has awesome vocals, brilliant beats, and some truely spaced out guitars have made Death of a Dead Day so freakin' heavy it'll leave you with half a face and a lump of coal where your brain may have one resided. known to have caused relapses in cured schizophrenics, the stop/start jaggerdness of the music should be limited to those who actually play an instrument, and have an understanding of why not everything should sound like Nicklecrap and Hinder.this cd will leave you wondering 'why didn't i get this sooner? am i some sort of wanker?'sweet"
5,Crazy Art-Prog-Metal,"This band has been such a cult favorite in the UK, and on their US debut, its easy to seeThe band is extremely original - with hints of System, MSI, and Dillinger Escape Plan. This album is extremely well executed and NOT ear friendly. You really can't sing along - all you can do is hang your head...Highly recommended for any fan of heavy/thrash metal. Can't wait till they tour the States."
1,Item not received for over 30+ days,Delivery was promised for 1 to 2 days. The JVC XL-SV22BK Single-Tray Karaoke Player would of been great to use for my children if received.
5,The Vitamin & Mineral Kitchen Chart is Wonderful!,"I really appreciated the detail andorganization that went into this chart. It is very informative, graphically pleasing to the eye, and make a great reference tool to ensure nutrition and health. Way to go!"
5,Finally Back In Print!!,"I'm so glad to finally get this cd after being out of print for so long.THUNDER ISLAND is definately the best song on this cd,but there are several other good tunes to be heard on this cd such as LOVE IS COLD. Joe Walsh plays lead guitar on this album and does a great job. Ferguson lays down a very smooth style of an upbeat mixture of keyboard and electric guitar oriented rock and roll. I think this is Jay Ferguson second best cd behind 1979's REAL LIFE AIN'T THIS WAY."
5,The Voyces are brilliant!,"I love this band. Got into them from the Jack Johnson album, Thicker Than Water. Seriously, some of the best lyrics I've heard...and beautiful harmonies. I give it five stars, even though Lie Down On Me is rotten."
2,Not inspired,"Too stereotyped. These are fairies everyone has seen before. Plus, the artwork itself it not terribly great, not something I'd want to imitate.For wing patterns and any other textures found in nature, I would go to the source itself instead of getting the info second-hand in a book like this. To study wing shapes and patterns, try A World Of Butterflies by Brian Cassie, et al; The Butterfly Handbook by Dr. Lee Miller; or Night Visions by Joseph Scheer, which has incredible close-ups of moths. The figures of the fairies themselves can be handled by learning simple figure drawing, and there are plenty of magazines and books with models in them to give you a reference. For beginners with a good eye, Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy by Christopher Hart is a good place to start.Focusing only on fairies will limit your artistic sensibility and talent. If you learn the parts, then you can create based on your own imagination and not on how someone else tells you things should look."
4,BEST PORTABLE RADIO I'VE HAD!!,"THIS HEADPHONE RADIO IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTABLE RADIO I'VE EVER HAD. IT'S GREAT TO TAKE TO A BALLGAME TO LISTEN TO PLAY-BY-PLAY, HAS CRISP AND DEEP SOUND AND IF YOU USE THE CONNECTOR TO USE WITH AN IPOD OR OTHER MP3 DEVICE THE SOUND IS PHENOMINAL!! YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.POSITIVES:BEHIND THE EAR DESIGN IS QUITE COFORTABLE, PORTABILITY, CRISP SOUNDS, DEEP BASS AND WEIGHT.NEGATIVES:YOU HAVE TO RECHARGE IT OFTEN TO KEEP THE BATTERY CHARGED SO THAT YOU WONT LOOSE YOUR PRESET STATIONS AND SETTING THE PRESETS A LITTLE COMPLICATED."
2,Better live Bob sets available,"Dylan's voice is just plain awful especially during 'Rainy Day Women'. One thing I do however like is that his grainy voice makes knockin on heaven's door sound 50 times better than the original, don't know why though. Other than that, it's painful to listen to no matter how much I enjoy his music. Some days he has it, other days he just doesn't."
2,Compactor in back of truck is not like the picture,"Bought for my son's 3rd birthday. He has other trash trucks and loves them. This one arrived and was opened on his birthday. Although he was happy, I was disappointed. It was not heavy weight plastic, but rather flimsy and brittle. the biggest problems were that the two trash containers do not stay still on the back loader and fall off. they also don't fit in the flimsy slots where they are supposed to be attached to when lifting them for emptying. Also, the compactor is not like a real truck design but two red cheap plastic spiral screw-type mechanism that's totally un-realistic. Wish we didn't tear open the box, so that I could return it."
2,Part came broken,"i sent this to my 4 year old grandson as a gift. He was so excited. However the garbage cans were broken . My daughter contacted Amazon and was told to send back or ""buy"" new cans. Sending back would have been heart breaking for my grandson. So she bought new cans. The truck was expensive. I am very disappointed that there was an additional expense."
4,"A great album, even if it's not as good as the debut!","I listened to this album so many times that the order of the songs is permanently imprinted in my brain. It is truly wonderful - ""Deep as you Go"" and ""Sunday Morning, Yellow Sky"" are two of my favorite songs. Mary Fahl's voice is incredible, very deep and rich like gourmet hot chocolate. The fantastic lyrics make this album another winner, although I still recommend that you get the debut album first."
5,Our whole family loves this!,My dear husband got this for me for my birthday. We have been watching it as a family and really enjoying the show and each other's company. My extended family has informed me that I'm not allowed to show up at our annual beach week without it!
3,"Worthwhile for a low price, but beware","Replete with valuable interviews and recorded exchanges between Groucho and friends, but also deliberately misleading about the author's ""friendship"" with Groucho, with all the exchanges between them near his death (and the ""best from Groucho"" autograph that takes up one page) being complete fabrications. Groucho (via the bipolar Erin Fleming, of course), withdrew his support for this book and barred Chandler (actual name Lyn Erhard) from his home in late 1975 (almost 2 years before his death) after discovering that she had no written agreement with her publisher for his biography. Such was probably unfair (but par for the course for Erin), but it didn't justify her rewriting history.This book is also disorganized and has no index, so prepare to be frustrated if you seek certain facts. And to reiterate, ignore the ""touching"" words of Groucho in the final chapters, because they never happened."
4,I-tal returns!,"These Cleveland reggae masters return with some old, some new stuff. Wets your appetitite for a re-release of some of their other material. Dave Smeltz is Dub!"
4,I see why people RAVE over early Stewart material!,"I decided to pick this up on remastered CD and I have to admit, this collection of early Rod Stewart material is simply rocking. I finally see what people are talking about when they RAVE about Rod's early material and how it reaches and touches them inside. So much soul and rock this guy has inside of him I just don't see any current artist doing this depth of work today. The track, ""Oh No not My Baby"" is worthy of buying this album alone."
4,Interesting and colorful,"This was my first time reading any work by Fred Harris, but I'm sure that it will not be my last time. I enjoyed the down to earth language and depiction of the characters. Having grownup in rural America, I found it easy to identify with the story line. Harris did a great job with details, which tended to lend a real sense of being there to the story.Although the book seemed a little slow in the beginning, it wasn't long before I reached the point of not wanting to put it down. Harris does a good job of keeping one's attention, but the ending was almost predictable.Overall, a very enjoyable book. Now that I've discovered Fred Harris, I can't wait to read his other fictional works."
2,"Rhoda Hendricks' ""Latin Made Simple"": Use With Caution!","This book is indeed easy to use, but the reader needs to exercise a high degree of caution with it. There are a large number of typos throughout the text and, more importantly, the answers to the translation exercises consistently use the wrong verb tenses, thus making it very easy for the novice to 'learn' the wrong thing! Moreover, the supplementary readings use quite a number of vocabulary words that are never introduced anywhere in the book. While the reading exercises are fun practice for beginners, this book needs to go through another revision, with careful attention to grammatical consistency, before it can be recommended without qualification."
2,A bit of a mess,"This really is a waste of time- buy a good Latin Dictionary, a Latin Grammar review chart, a good basic program-( Oxford, or Cambridge is good for younder students- Wheelock's is tedious but good, especially for older students,) and then supplement with some fun stuff like Latin Mythica or other great publications from Bolchazy-Carducci . This should be a good book but the editorial carelessness just makes it not so!"
4,Great Value,"Tripod leg covers come in a wide range of prices. You can pay as little as $20 or as much as $50 (maybe more?). So I chose these - being in the middle of the range.They are pretty easy to put on, though you need to attach the double-sided tape that comes with it to your tripod legs. I'm a little uneasy about this but I guess it's necessary. You then just cut the foam tubing to fit, open and place over the tape. Then just pull up the stretchy black ""tube socks"" over the top.Works great - much easier to carry and keeps you from having to hold on to the cold legs. The reason only 4 stars is that the tape is almost worthless and the foam doesn't stick well, so the whole thing spins around the leg. Not a huge issue but annoying."
3,leg covers,"I ordered the covers in order to walk with the tripod and my Canon 50D with a 500 Canon supertelephoto attached to it, weighing over 14 pounds and placed over my shoulder. The covers would serve as cushions.I have not gone to the forest to try it, but I have used it with a shorter lens, and of course, less weight. So far, it works pretty well."
3,"It's okay, but could be more informative",This guide needs work. It is too general and tries to cover all of the states in the Southeast. The Audubon Society needs to break it into two and be more informative in both.
5,Stunning Virtuosity! Magnificent!,"I have enjoyed this music, performed by Leslie Howard as part of his exhaustive Liszt repertoire, for many years. Marc-Andre Hamelin takes the six Paganini Grand Etudes to new heights of glory and inspiration. Bravo!"
1,NOT THE SAME BOOK!!,"It is not clear on which edition this book was. This said it was the second edition but the first edition was sent to me. It even has a picture of the second edition, which is not correct."
5,Good Quality!,"I purchased this gardening set for my niece for her birthday. I was really impressed by how sturdy the tools are. They are made of metal, not plastic, and have good weight to them. They seem like they could really get the job done, without being too sharp or dangerous. My sister loves how they all fit snugly in the tote and she's really excited to start gardening with my niece. I think that overall, this is a really high quality child's gardening set for the price."
5,One of Christie's Best!,"This is the first Christie book I have read in a while. I sure am glad that I did. This is one of the finest Christie mysteries, both for its marvellous use of atmosphere as well as its twisty, holding plot. This is an incredible mystery filled with local color and plenty of suspects to go around - the description of the splendors of Egypt is wonderful and the characters of all the passengers on board are well developed. Christie shifts the possibility of guilt like a kaleidescope, showing us in turn how almost every single passenger on the cruise had a plausible reason for wishing Linnet Doyle dead....the ending is a genuine shocker, yet completely believeable. You must read this book if you are a mystery lover, it will play havoc with all your notions about guilt and innocence!"
2,Boring and Predictable,"I do feel a tad guilty about giving this book such a low mark.After all, Dame Christie was and is a legend and I do believe in the 30,s 40,s and 50,s her books were much better received.Maybe I am just too jaded.I hope not. The book is a nice quick read but it is boring and my wife(who only listened to a few hints) and I figured out the killer easily and quickly. And the effete little Periot is almost a farcical figure with his cute little sayings etc.When Mrs. Doyle says, ""Why I haven't an enemy in the world,"" near the beginning , you know she is, how you say, the ""piece of toast>""Thats how cute little Hercules would have, how you say, said it.HE too often comes up with some really droll wonderful expression like, ""Ah, life is so mysterious"" or some such.The first, and how you say, the last of her books, I shall open."
4,Norma the magnificent,"Worth it if only to watch the dazzling skills of Norma Aleandro who's great in anything she does. The movie is less than great---doesn't hold up against ""The Official Story"" or ""Son of the Bride"", but she's always great to watch, and it is often touching."
1,Cheez-issimo!,"This set fails in two essential ways: the ""All-Audio"" lessons are spoken too quickly to accurately hear the pronuciation, and the tiny booklet fails to list the words/phrases in the order given on the CD. It's an excercise in pure frustration.I am returning this set for a refund."
3,An expensive PR piece,"I'm interested in learning the Alexander Technique with no prior knowledge, so based on the other reviews I thought this book would help me get started. Unfortunately, the book is not a ""Complete Illustrated Guide,"" but rather a brief illustrated overview of the Alexander Technique. Nor does the book provide a ""Practical Program,"" but rather directs you to find a certified AT instructor to learn the technique that is illustrated but not taught in this book. If the title were changed to ""An Illustrated Introduction to the Alexander Technique,"" that would be much more accurate. And the book is a good introduction, which is why it still rates 3 stars."
3,"GREAT SHOW! ... but,","the streaming was not too fast, I had to wait several times for the show to catch up with the loading ..... I'm also upset that this was not able to view on the FX website....just another way to make a buck for these companies. I had to see it so I paid the 1.99 . . . I should have gotten the Prime account, I'll have to reconsider the benefits that come with Amazon Prime,.... it's looking better to me."
5,Great show and season yet!,Yes I would recomend this to anyone. Its a great season yet. Also its afordable and you get to choose the episodes you want to purchase. Thanks Amazon.
1,Sad to say...I am out.,"I am a HUGE fan of AHS season 1 and it is with sadness I can't say the same about Asylum. When I realized what the creators were going to do with each season, I thought it was risky but brilliant. I loved the idea; so I waited with anticipation for Asylum to start...they even have the actor from Babe...well know and uber talented added to the cast this year. Zachary Quinto and Jessica Lange and Evan Peters back...I was SO stoked...then I watched it. I tried, tried SO hard to love it like I did season one...but I just can't. It isn't that there is too much going on...I don't like torture porn. I find it trite and unnecessary. So for those reasons I am out. Here's hoping season 3, if there is one, is more along the lines of true horror instead of just horrific."
5,Better than Season 1,"Different story and characters, same actors. Season two has a lot more juicy twists without any of the confusion. Most of all is has a GREAT and SOLID ending."
3,"not as good as season 1, but I'm still hooked","The trailers were way more scary and interesting than the actual show. Definitely not as good as first season, but I'm invested and now hooked. There are just flirts with evil and aliens, but there is no substance behind it. It's a surface level story. Love Jessica Lang and the guy who plays Kit."
3,Plots ahoy,"There were so many plots the dark soap opera had me on the edge of my seat. The first season was contained within the house, and all the stories were where people were trying to remove themselves from the house,While the second season had great promise and direction I think the aliens was too muchAlso when Dylan McDermott twittering plot point upset me.The season was disconbonbulated but I will watch again next year"
4,A GREAT SERIES,"ITS A SHAME THERE IS NO SEASON THREE,BUT alas its not to be .surfing on Net flix i found season one quite by accident and thought oh well i should give it a shot.To my pleasant surprise the first episode grabbed me and would not let me go, i have to tell you i am not a standard slasher woman running from the crazed deformed chain saw killer in the woods horror fan .THIS IS NOT THAT TYPE OF SERIES!!!it will intrigue you and grab you and keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next episode, it is dark, gritty surreal, and will scare the blazing heck out of you with it's surprising and pleasant storyline.You like ghosts ok i get it , you like mystery its here, you like a believable story line you got it!!My suggestion is this .. watch season one first and be prepared for a darker version in season two , but sadly our family leaves and doesn't return but the characters in season two are given life by a few of our favorites from season one .its all there enjoy"
4,AHS Asylum,I gave this Season of this show the four star rating because itsvery exciting and well thought out anyone who lovessuspens and the feeling of fear and American Horror Story Asylum deffantly providesThat rush a thrill seeker is looking for
4,All in all a good show,"Just finished the season finally. It was good, but not as good as the first season....looking forward to the next season :o)"
4,Great show,I really love the twistedness behind the story. Some areas I felt it did not run smooth but it all came together at the end. Great show!! Must watch!
5,Obsessed!,"Since we don't have a DVR, this was our only option for seeing last week's episode. Considering there are no shows I would pay by episode for, I willingly paid for this!! This season might even be better than last season!"
5,MUST SEE,Amazing! Love this show. I purchased the SD and have it streaming on my tv. Great quality with the SD - save money and do SD unless you have money to burn
5,Addicting!,"Love this show. It can be hard to watch, but then you can not stop watching! I will be impatiently waiting for Season 3!"
1,Terrible,"Bought it wanting to see what it's about and it's terrible. FX has never produced a lot of high quality programming, but this is filth. If the intent was to make the viewer uncomfortable not in a scared way, but in a dirty way...job done."
1,Not as good as season 1,This story makes no sense. It isn't a continuation of the first season. It is a totally different show altogether. I only watched 1 episode because it didn't make any sense to me.
1,Streaming Was Just Awful,"we watched this series through our xbox and it was just awful. don't know if it's xbox or amazon, but we won't watch on our xbox again. we have a samsung tv and says we could download prime vido app and it doesn't show on our tv."
2,Story Line,The storyline of the second season is just not as captivating as the first season.I'm unhappy on how the writers had created this story line.
5,fantastic,"great story, great writing, love that most of the same cast is back playing different characters. just enough sexy and scary - highly recommend!"
5,Amazing,"Waaaay better than season 1 and I loved season 1. It's a great series, with talented actors & writers. Worth watching"
5,Totally hooked!,"I started to watch s 1 when it first came out but didnt give the series enough attention. Now I can hardly wait for each episode, the series is completely twisted and I love it"
2,lacking but full of gratuitous shocks,I bought the dvds for season one because It was so addicting.season 2 is a season I'll catch up now and again as i pay bills or do dishes.... I love horror films but season 2 just shocks to shock. Not much character development or sufficient reason to care about the characters.
2,Unsubscribed from this show,"This show became less about constructing an actual horror story and more about throwing shock factor after visceral shock factor at the reader until it became simply disgusting. There's no horror here, only a pallid drama and very few characters to establish human interest and root for."
3,American Joke,"Last season was so much better. The show still has me though, I cant get enough of Jessica Lange. But I wish the show did more of what they did last year. Last year you never knew who was alive and who was dead. This year, not so much, its been like a B teen horror flick."
3,ehhh shoulda waited for netflix,Not nearly as good as the first season. Wish I wouldn't have paid for it and waited for free streaming.
3,Not as impressed with this season as last,"The cameo cast seems more star-studded, but perhaps that is due to the first season being so good. This season's episodes do not have me wanting to see the next one with any sense of urgency that the first season did."
5,most disturbing show I have ever watched!,"AHS is, by far, the most disturbing show that has ever been aired on cable and the only show I watch religiously. Even though I spend half the time watching through my hands, I absolutely love it and can't get enough! Wickedly AMAZING!"
3,Not what I expected,"The first season of AHS was awesome, I like that they tried to shake things up a bit but I was not impressed. I couldn't finish watching the season, guess some things aren't like the original."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Thriller that Keeps You Guessing!!!,"After reading the reviews for ""The Last of Sheila"", I could not help but rent it immediately! Needless to say, the reviews did not disappoint - it met all my expectations and them some! Immediately after the first viewing, I just had to watch it twice more to catch all the clues I missed; as another viewer states, you catch something new every time. The commentary with Dick and Dyan (and an annoyingly inserted Raquel Welch) is delightful as well. This is just a cleverly written, simply wonderful Agatha Christie-esque thriller with the added bonus of a very 70s kitsch factor - do not let yourself miss ""The Last of Sheila""!"
3,A superb cast and script offset by pedestrian direction and cinematography,A superb mystery thriller script by Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins gets the all-star cast treatment. Unfortunately Herbert Ross' pedestrian direction give this movie the feel of an Italian 70's B-movies.
2,THE GAME OF MURDER,"Directed by Herbert Ross (Steel Magnolias), LAST OF SHEILA (Warner) is an ingenious and witty thriller written by game players Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins (Psycho). It's set on a yacht cruising just off the French Riviera. The stellar cast includes James Mason, James Coburn, Dyan Cannon, Raquel Welch, Ian McShane, Joan Hackett and Richard Benjamim. The story revolves around the hit and run death of Sheila, wife of Hollywood mogul Coburn. He thinks his friends know more about her death than they have said. In an attempt to find the truth, he invites them for a holiday cruise and some game playing. For the home viewer, clues are everywhere and warrant a second viewing. Amusing, superficial, commentary is from Benjamin, Cannon and Welch, although it sounds like Welch's input was edited in after the fact."
4,Future return customer,"Everything I would have gotten at a local store, half the price, delivered to my door. What's not to like."
1,Nonsense,"Yet another attempt by the neo-con sub-class to obfuscate decency, morality, and the truth. Something is profoundly wrong with these people and I consider them to be a danger to this country and the world at large. Read it but be wary."
5,Awesome and Life Changing,I was assigned to read this text for a course. It was one of the most life changing reads of my entire life. I have recommended the book to family and friends and I will continue to do so.It was a liberating read which caused me to evaluate my own thoughts towards those that are able bodied and those that are not. My concept of what is whole and what is not has also been affected. And although I do not live with a handicap the book gave me insight that I could have never imagined.Thank you Nancy Eisland for a marvelous work.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Beware! This is not country music by any standards. This is pure minstrel blues. Plenty of annoying trumpet and nasally minstrel singing. No steal guitar, actually no acoustic guitar. This was marketed to country fans, but there is nothing country about this. Don't make the same mistake I did. I am sure this is a fine blues CD, but I bought it because I was told it was country."
4,Great Cd but Bonus DVD is Not of the Concert,i bought this cd thinking the bonus dvd would be of the same concert as the cd or at least have something to do with willie. instead it is a video promotion of billy bob's. the cd is still sweet though.
4,Really Great Novel,I have been waiting for Margaret Truman latest novel. It doesn't disappoint. It starts with Annabel and Mac investigating the murder of Charise Lee a rising opera singer. But don't think it's a simple murder case it's a lot behind the scenes. You will have a ball finding out. I highly recommended this book.
2,Un-believable,"Throughout this book one wondered where the writer was going...the last several chapters gave us the answer...nowhere. Dialogue and actions were just simply, unbelievable. I agree with the other reviewers who did not enjoy this book...and I, too, believe that Margaret is not actually the author, but has simply lent her name to the series...sadly."
3,This game is not as good as i thought it would be.,I think that they could of put more time into this game. I think that it is about the same as last years execpt the hits and the croud. I think that you should think about buying this game before you go buying it. I think that you should rent it before buying this game.
4,"Best Xbox live game, if it didn't disconnect so much...","This game is by far the best title out for Xbox live. Unfortunetly it is the worst title when it comes to disconnects and lag. The improvements are OK over last years version, but if it weren't for the online play, it wouldn't be worth the upgrade.If you loved playing against your friends on 2004, you will love the game online."
3,Highly Overrated,"Cool new features, however same stale gameplay that has haunted EA for years. Passing is too difficult. Players drop easy catches and then sky over multiple defenders to snag a hail mary. The running game has improved some, but players still run either full speed or stop dead. No change of speed, stutter steps, or side steps in this game. EA has not changed this since the Sega Genesis days. They've gotten lazy, and ESPN has passed them as the better football game. If only they made a college game... Oh well, Roll Tide!"
1,Mark O'Connors Jazz Facsimile,"This is not Hot and it is in no way Swing...I like string bands, I wasn't expecting Louie Prima here but...this is beyond insulting to everything Jazz stands for. If you are young and just learning about swing...DISREGARD THIS MUSIC!!!! Mark O'Connor is a fine fiddle player but if you want hot swing music, you are looking in the wrong place. If, however, you have trouble sleeping, this will definitely cure your insomnia, which is never something I had previously associated with ""Hot Swing""."
2,this toy has a big flaw,"I wanted the learning experience of puzzles for my 2 year old, but there is one big flaw in this toy, the pictures dont appear under each piece, so once they are all out of place, my toddler cant find a way to put them back. I was very dissaponted by this, I dont like putting it together myself, its way too complicated for a child. She is not interested in these puzzles at all, I feel lve wasted my money."
3,Worth the wait.,"This witty, sardonic masterpiece can be summed up in two words: Bitter sophistication."
5,The Versatile Vizsla an excellent comprehensive guide to the breed,"I purchased this book to help me prepare me for ownership of a Vizsla puppy. The book is extremely comprehensive and a great reference manual for a range of issues from selecting your puppy to obedience and care throughout the life cycle of the dog. I particularly liked the information on selection of a puppy and the different considerations if wanting a dog for the field, show or obedience & agility. The detail on the breed standard was also very helpful."
5,A complete look at owning a vizsla from puppy to old age.,This book provides a thorough understanding of the vizsla's personality as well as information on responsible ownership.
4,Sub Woofer,"This is a great Sub Woofer for its price, I like it because of its ability to make u be able to feel the movie you're watching, or the music you're listening to."
4,Outdoor Speakers,"I bought these based on the previous reviews. I am not disappointed. They were easy to mount and sound better than my older more expensive RCA's. They are loud enough and deep enough, they sound great."
4,Wasn't as impressed...,"I think she could have done more with this remix album, such as having more songs remixed, not the same ones over and over. It is pretty good, but I wish I hadn't paid so much for it."
4,Loved this book,"I actually loved reading this book, mostly because the author went to so much trouble in treating it like a travel guide, with actual histories of the lighthouses and the hauntings, and including phone numbers and websites."
1,booorrrrrrrinng overly dramatic NYC house,"this is tired, boring, overly dramatic house, and kevin's vocals are corny to the point of being campy, almost laughable. try again hon :("
3,Mostly Good,"This is P.O.D.'s both best and worst album. Songs like ""Roots In Stereo"", ""If You Could See Me Now"" and ""Mistakes and Glories"" are P.O.D. at their best. Songs like ""On The Grind"" and ""Goodbye for Now"" are P.O.D. at their worst. I know they wanted to do the whole guest artist thing but sometimes it just doesn't work out (both musically and lyrically) as evident in ""On The Grind"". ""Goodbye for Now"" contains obvious direct allusion to Linkin Park and lacks P.O.D.'s solid originality which has always seperated them.Only about a third of the album doesn't measure up so I give it 3 stars. If you're looking for more solid P.O.D. albums check out Fundamentals of Southtown (solid rap and hardcore) or the self-titled (solid hard rock)."
2,Dissapointing,"P.O.D.'s previous cd's have been really good (especially ""Payable on Death"")but now they have dissapointed me. After the great sound they had in their previous cd, i had great expectations for ""Testify."" When i finally got my hands on the cd, i didn't know what to say. It was bad. They had a few good songs on it such as ""Roots in Stereo"", ""This Time"", and ""Strength of my life"" but other than those songs, the cd is pretty much worthless."
3,CD: Excelente DVD: Malo,"Saludos! al adquirir esta edición CD+DVD de la historia de enanitos verdes quede medio decepcionado: el DVD sólo tiene 3 videos, cuya resolucion no es muy buena (aparte los 3 videos no son canciones muy exitosas, si fuera de juzgar solamente por el dvd se podria decir que la historia de los enanitos verdes fue ""horrible"", la mejor es solamente ""amores lejanos"" y no es muy clasica que digamos), ahora por otro lado el CD de AUDIO es muy bueno, tiene muchos ""exitos"" interpretados en vivo (al contrario del dvd), recomendado solo para fanaticos de los enanitos verdes"
2,disappointed,I have been a Cheap Trick fan since I was a little kid. I really looked forward to this album coming out. I was sorely disappointed. It's just odd and I don't think there's one redeeming song on it. Don't waste your money.
5,back and better than ever,"If you liked any of the early cheap trick releases then you will love this one. All of the songs are good and the vast majority are excellent. Same basic formula, catchy, driving, memorable songs, however, the songs are more varied and lean less towards ""bubble gum"" rock than their prior releases. The sound, while still power pop, is much more mature and consistent. Highly recommended."
4,Very good but Robin's age shows,"Since I first saw Cheap Trick at the age of 11 in 1978 (Cobo Hall in Detroit) I knew I loved this band. Having purchased all of their independent releases after they left the major labels, this is by far their best effort. Robin's vocals are rough at times but he is still one of the finest pop/rock vocalists I have ever heard. If you enjoy CT, you will find some magical moments in almost every song. This is rich music and CT has delivered their fans another incredible experience."
4,Very strong album by an important band,"I agree with most of the others that this is a very good Cheap Trick album. They have stripped away all of the excesses and have focused on strong melodies and plenty of guitar punch. It's renewed my interest in the band after they lost me in the 80s. My favorite songs on the album are the last three - ""Dream the Night Away"", ""All Those Years"", and ""Decaf"". I find that interesting, since most bands stack the best songs at the beginning of the album. Here's proof that guys in their 50s can still rock!!!"
5,Will the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Please WAKE UP!!!! Cheap Trick is your most horrific and continued snub....,"Okay, how many more decades does this highly respected quartet have to go on before ever truly getting the respect they deserve?Now don't get me wrong as I am a fan of the Beastie Boys as well, but having to see them get inducted into the 2008 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame before legends like Cheap Trick tells me that those who vote on the inductees are perhaps the same clueless dopes who spent time as executives at commercial radio stations or record labels.Keep up the great work Cheap Trick. Your fans know how relevant you are and will always be!!!"
2,Oh Bob,"I always loved the Newhart show, but never got to experience The Bob Newhart Show. It's a start and you can see as it goes on the characters developing. I'm almost halfway through and I can see Suzanne's character change to what we all remember her as, so savvy, not the typical housewife. One thing I do notice, the interaction and admiration between the husband and wife. As far as the other characters I am not too impressed, you see too much of the airline navigator/neighbor stopping by too much and too much of Jerry Robinson, the Dentist. It's usually Bob's patients that will generally make you laugh and I hope to see more of them in the upcoming seasons. I am not so happy with the way it was restored. The color seems very brown and the audio is terrible compared to most shows, but it is the 1st season. And as far as I can see, no great special features on this one. But like I said, it's a start and part of a collection set to improve."
3,Dry but overall ok,I myself do not like dry humor so I didn't really get this show. Although I thought it was neat that the secretary is Ben Stiller's mom.
3,Awesome,It was a great book nothing like the movie though. I really love the movie Journey to the Mysterious Island
5,One of my All Time Favourites,"Although I may have seen the films with oversized monsters, I had never read this book until now. But somehow I think it lived in my heart. Having read Robinson Crusoe I have always had a fantasy of living on a deserted island far away from the hustle and bustle of the modern world. Here in this book Jules Verne describes this reality with five very capable men willing to do all to make their island home as good as anything in New York. And they don't half do well. I just loved the whole story, environment and the mysterious benefactor hidden somewhere on the island. It might be nearly a hundred and fifty years old, but it still moved me, particularly at the end. Loved it."
4,The Mysterious Island,Had seen the movie back when it came out but never read the book. The book was only slightly like the movie. It was a classical piece of Science Fiction literature. Enjoyed the book even more than the movie. Was defintely worth my time.
4,Interesting Adventure,"I think that The Mysterious Island was a pretty good book to me. It is about five men and one dog who were flying in a balloon during the civil war. They were caught by a storm, and they landed on a helpful island. Since no one had ever seen or heard of the island that they were on, they decided to civilize it, and name it after their discovery. Pretty soon, when everything seems to be going well, many mysterious things start to happen on the island, which they name Lincoln Island. And animal mysteriously dies while attacking Top, their dog and they discover a bullet in a pig, that no one put there. While they learn to survive on the island, they ultimately learn the secret to the heart of the island."
4,Jules Verne is arguably one of the great writters,"This classic is a must read, especial for anyone who has read 20,000 Leagues .. Even if you simply watched Walt Disney's early film adaptation your sure to enjoy this story. There are a few place where it drags a bit and some of the language usage is dated, but that some how seems to add to it's charm."
4,The Mysterious Island,"I haven't read all of the book yet, but what I have read seems very good. Would recommend to others"
1,Not for anyone who likes correct translations,"I love this novel but I disapprove of this Kindle version which shows a lack of respect for J. Verne. Even in an adaptation, one should at least conserve the names of the characters and translate correctly what the author wrote.The leading character in Verne's novel is ""l'ingenieur Cyrus Smith"". In this version, he becomes ""Captain Cyrus Harding""! Cyrus Smith explained to his companion that coral is built by ""animalcules"" (in French animalcule = microscopic animal). Captain Harding is obviously less informed in natural history, as he stated(locations 2344-48)that ""Coral INSECTS... made the island of Clermont-Tonnerre..."" As far as I know, ""animalcule"" is a perfectly good English word. So why this ridiculous ""translation""? Since when do coral builders have 6 legs, a chitinous skeleton and 2 antennae?"
3,Hard to read in a number of ways,"I read this right after I got my Kindle. I don't care about the format or any of that, so no comments relating to that. There were several words the kindle dictionary didn't recognize, a little disappointing. I found the story somewhat entertaining, totally male of course, there isn't even a mention of females until near the end of the book when they are talking about Herbert bringing his wife back. Any group of men stranded on an island would definitely have some sort of conversation about the lack of females! Also the mindset described (regarding killing every animal in sight without a thought) is a good reminder of why our planet is in so much trouble. I found that aspect pretty sad actually. The deference that everyone showed to the ""captain"" was pretty silly. Finally, it was so implausible that it got boring."
5,Mysterious Island,"Another classic Jules Verne novel. You will love this book and if you can manage to see it on t.v., it was a great movie as well. Wow!"
5,If you liked this one...,"Excellant! One of a class of books like Robinson Caruso, Swiss Familiy Robinson. You might also include Coral Island and Lord of the Files. But did you know that Verne also wrote a boy's story called The Long Vacation which tells a similar (and perhaps even better) story? If you can find it, that is great too! p.s. There is a little bit of racism in both of these Verne books. Both have a black cabin boy character who is black although neither are treated badly and both are very positive characters."
4,Ok,This book was great though I was sad the orang died watch the movie journey2 the mysterious island it tells a little bit about the book
3,Ends better than it starts,The first third of this book is very slow. Very slow. But the story picks up nicely after that. Fun read.
5,Excellent Reading,"Jules Verne, what more can be said ?? This fanticy has so many subtile twists that you have difficulty putting it down at least till the chapter ends."
2,Wrong Again?,"In 1982, the learned Sovietologist Seweryn Bialer of Columbia University wrote in Foreign Affairs: ""The Soviet Union is not now nor will it be during the next decade in the throes of a true systemic crisis, for it boasts enormous unused reserves of political and social stability."" read this as interesting material. however, it doesn't seem that the author learned from his past mistakes."
2,horribly slow.,i rented this and im so glad that i did only rented it. it has nick cage which is a great actor but the story is so slow. i watched 30 minutes of it then just watched the rest on fast forward. i suggest renting.
3,Bangkok Dangerous,"This is definitely a renter. I enjoy most of Nicholas Cage's movies, but this just felt familiar and the Bangkok locale didn't give it the life it needed. Unfortunately Cage was looking long in the tooth and his hairpiece was horrible. Add the fact the assassin mentoring another assassin has been a number of times by the likes of Stallone and Banderas (Assassins), Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent (The Mechanic), and others. If you don't have something else to watch rent this for a rainy day. Good quality DVD with minimal replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Eraser"".CA Luster"
2,jensen inverter review,"at supposedly 300 watts, i thought this would be a perfect carry-along to run small tools,recharge phones,play cd players,devices,etc.WRONG! For recharging phones;ok. small cd players;ok. dremel or smaller similar tools,nothing happening!just a loud high squeal which denotes the appl is pulling more amps than this weak ass unit can supply. should have gone for the higher wattage model which can power a wider asst. of appls. the only positive is the cig lighter plug-in instead of direct-to-battery hookup which is a pain in the ass."
4,Satisfied,"I have read all other reviews from the people who had purchased this product before I did. There were numerous notes about the noise this product makes when running and yes, there is a fan noise while this is in use. But I believe the usefulness of this item far outweighs the inconvenience of the fan noise. I only used it once so far to run a heated blanket for a road trip and it did the job as expected. The size can be a little burden but you can keep it underneath the driver's or the passenger seat. I only used it for about a month now so I can't comment on the life expectancy as others have commented about this product stopped running after few months."
1,Check the Specs - Will not work for most cars,"I was about to leave on a long road-trip. I liked the fact it had 2 plugs. But when it arrived and I opened it to check the manual, I discovered it requires a special connection to the car battery and was not recommended for most cars. I checked my car manual and discovered it could only handle 100 WATTS, so the purchase was totally useless. Please check your car manual before you purchase such an item. In fact, on the road trip, we burned out the car adapter by overloading it with 3 devices with standard car charger adapters. We also found that another AC adapter overheated, and would not supply sufficient power, unless the other devices were unplugged."
3,"So far it was good, now it started giving noise.",I bought this a year back. It worked great for 1 year. I always use this whenever I go for trips. It still works without any problem except it recently started giving some noise(probably because of the fan).You can definetely get irritated unless you have music on with good volume.
4,Power inverter,"This is a great product, now I can recharge my MP4 and my Cel at the same time, most people complains about the noise of the fan, I consider that is normal in that kind of products."
5,If you want to know about war in Bosnia - read this book,"The Mahmutcehajic's work is a perfect literature for anyone who ever wanted to know why Bosnian war happened, why Genocide, Concentration camps and enormous human suffering and misery occurred at the end of the twentieth century and what was this conflict all about. I am sure this essay will satisfy anyone who wants to discover more about Bosnian tragedy either professionally or out of curiosity. For historians an politicians Mahmutcehajic's work represents an excellent and detailed expertise, for history, politics or international affairs Students it is the richest resource available about War in Bosnia and for just a curious reader it is the best yet informer about one of the greatest human tragedies in this century."
5,Great read !,"A true tale of one young flyer's trip through WWII, hair raising, hilarious and tear-starting. Reminds us how very young these men ,were, unaware of their own mortality. You read this one with laughter but holding your breath the whole time."
3,Not worth the money,"This sharpener is overly complicated for the results. It's bigger and harder to use than one of those little $6 carbide/ceramic two stage V-sharpeners, and the results are no better. This sharpener does work pretty much as advertized, but you can get as good or better results with a little pocket V-sharpener, for about $35 less.One advatage of this sharpener over a simple V sharpener is that it does put a double bevel. This is a technique of sharpening where the main blade bevel is, in this case 20 degrees, and the honed edge is at a slightly wider angle, 24 degrees in this case. Ideally this gives a more durable edge and allows you to re-sharpen with just a quick hone. Even with this fact, and the compulsion I'll have to use it just because I spent $40 on it, I don't see myself using this over my pocket V-sharpener."
1,Need power source and special connections,"The box I got was leaking some unknown fluid and I sent it back.But actually worst of all, these are not ready to go out of the box, even after adding batteries. You need an external 12v DC power source. As in, it comes with bare wires, you add your own connection and power source.For the same total amount, I found RF wireless (non line of sire IR junk) headphones for $20 each. Look for those and skip these!"
3,headphones wrong type,"i thought i ordered wireless headphones for use in my home, mainly for television. but the ones i received were for car use. inappropriate for home use. in looking back at the description, the word ""mobile"" was used. the word car was not mentioned. amazon arranged for a return with refund."
2,So-so,This album is a live concert filled with applause and some new work. The original albums are much better.
1,Where's the completed version of Me and Bobby McGee?,"I love Janis, but this cd is just a sampler. Get her albums or the box set if you want a better picture of her greatness. I mean, how can this be called ""essential"" songs when it does not include the completed version of Me and Bobby McGee? It just includes the demo (which is good), but it seems the completed version is the ""essential"" version to have!"
3,It should have been better,"Perhaps the admiration I have for both Helen Mirren and Anne Bancroft led me to expect more; but Bancroft seems to be reduced to a cartoon character procuress. Mrs. Stone is more fully rounded, but the limitations of a faithful translating of William's story to the film are very dominant. (I doubt if he could ever have conceived of a middle-aged woman having a fling with a younger man and having it NOT end badly!) I wished that I could have seen a greater self-awareness in Mrs. Stone; occasionally it began to rise up in Helen Mirren's eyes, then faded away, leaving me repeatedly disappointed. The background music was extraordinarily annoying, and I could have used at least a little exposition as to the significance of the beggar."
3,Ancient but not up-to-date,"Josephus is great - I don't disagree with the other reviewers on that score. His first-hand account of an important historical era is fascinating and informative. My problem, and my reason for 3 instead of 5 stars, is the translation. Whiston's translation has been the standard one for almost 3 centuries, and this is its drawback. The archaic English is almost as much work to translate as the original Latin (assuming, of course, that you can read Latin). While I can still follow the text, it becomes work rather than an enjoyable read.I think it's high time for somebody to do a new translation into contemporary English"
5,The Complete Works of Josephus,"An excellant book, I recommend it highly. To be able to read a personal account of biblical events is really something."
5,"Josephus isn't for the masses, but...","It's a long term project, reading Josephus, but well worth it. Small print, lots of pages, thick book. But the background information on history: previously only heard about how good it was, but now can read at my leisure.I checked this out of the library, and was so fascinated w/the in-depth knowledge of the era, the great facts, the saga Josephus presents, how interesting he personally is, that I ordered it from Amazon. I'm glad I did."
3,Cotton Candy from Gorme,"Outstanding enunciation, beautiful voice, just the right vibrato, engaging dynamics, some good songs with the one out-of-place exception of ""You Need Hands"" (huh?). What Matt Monro does with the male voice, Eydie accomplishes on the female side: practically definitive interpretations. ""I'll Take Romance"" gives off whiffs of Keely Smith and June Christy while remaining Eydie--including that soaring screech near the end. This collection will send me back to other early Eydie."
3,kids love it,I have made two recipes out of this book and the pictures are great for kids selecting what they want to make.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I bought the book because I am trying to encourage my kid to expand her food choices beyond chicken nuggets. There are no real meals in this book. Mostly desserts, and weird ""cutsie"" food, like pizza's with faces. I think I will just stick with using adult recipes and allowing her to help."
4,My granddaughter,Bought for my granddaughter and am looking forward to having a great time baking with her. Very exciting . Thanks
3,Horrible Grammar and Editing! Shame on the Publisher,The story itself is rather entertaining (although not nearly as addictive as any of Diana Gabaldon's books). But I am quite disappointed in the kindle version of this book. There are quite a few grammatical errors and misspellings on EVERY page! It gets hard to follow the story when there are so many mistakes. Shame on the publishers for taking $$ for such a poor product.
2,Disappointed,"After reading the high praise for this book I was disappointed. The writing is fair and while the story line works for the first part of the book one soon realizes that many plot points are really for an upcoming book. As this was a first novel by this author I thought that it would stand on it's own but ***SPOILER*** when I got to the end I was right in my suspicion that this was all set up for a second book. I love series and don't have a problem with plot points scattered as seeds for upcoming works but usually those books stand on their own and have a conclusion on their own. After the first part (noted as such), it's all set up for the sequel. When I don't race to finish a book but feel that ""I might as well since I'm half way through"" it's not a good sign."
4,Wonderful Scottish Romance,"When I first began reading Kilgannon I thought it was going to be a straight ripoff of Dianan Gabaldon (also my favorite series) but this book goes into its own story lines and set in a different time period. While Alex is a lot like Jamie, MANY historical romance heroes are alike - especially if you narrow down the topics to roughly the same time period and the same country. Bottom line - if you like the Outlander series you will like Kilgannon (I read it in one sitting!). I really loved the historical research that went into this book. I never knew before where the term Jacobite came from! I finished Kilgannon yesterday and will begin The Wild Rose of Kilgannon today and will probably not put it down until I'm finished. WONDERFUL STORIES !"
2,"Performance Wonderful, Technical Quality Very Poor","I can only echo the accolades of Josh White but if you want to hear good quality transfers stay away from this CD. As the samples on this page demonstrate, the audio in over half of these cuts was processed to death. Bed Spring Blues is an example of noise reduction and gating used to extremes. One third of the original performance is gone. You'd think a label like Sony would take more pride in their workmanship."
1,Crank 2 does not play,Crank 2 won't play. The picture shows a small square in the center of the screen and the rest of the screen is black. Upgrading the firmware in the blu-ray player did not help any.
4,"Good tool, directions would be nice","I ordered this chain tool and used it to remove my first bike chain. I almost damage my chain because the tool doesn't come with instructions, and the groves that hold the chain in place are a bit ambiguous as to where exactly to put the chain. A small little picture on the back of the packaging would have been great. Fortunately, no damage was done, and the tool did it's job. It feels strong enough to not break on me anytime soon, but isn't quite an everyday use tool for quality. It's good for me, since I don't plan on removing my chain any more than a few times a season (and that would be on the high side)."
4,A painter of Russian history,"I was introduced to Surikov and his splendid historical paintings more than fifty years ago when I was in high school, as several of them were included in the book An Illustrated History of Russia. These were in black and white and the images were small, so that I thought of them, not as works of art, but merely as illustrations. I now realize that he was indeed a great painter."
3,Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake,I just wanted to let everyone out there know that the Neptunes Remix of this song is featuring Justin Timberlake or so I heard.I don't have the CD so I can't be sure.
2,Yarka Gouache Set,"Yarka gouache is a good for the money. It has strong pigment. Not a great lightfastness of the colors. It is very opaque; pencil drawing does not show through the paint. It does not leave streaks of color but leaves round spots when you cover a large area. It is safe for kids, ACMI non-toxic.The jars are very difficult to open and when you do open it, the paint often splashes. After paint dries it becomes much lighter. The thickness of the paint is inconsistent. Black is more watery than other colors. Yarka is far from professional quality."
4,Excellent cooling capacity with modest problem.,"This Max Cold cooler (we have four) is amazing at keeping things really cold for several days in extreme conditions. There is one modest problem with the coolers that does not reflect at all on the cooling performance: the plastic interior hinge connections are easy to break. Since they are superfluous, we give this an excellent thumbs up in the cooler department!"
2,The latches break and cost $15 to fix.,"The cooler is large. I am 6'2"" and can climb inside and close it from the inside. Stuff stays very cold. I purchased it to keep equipment cold in the back of a Subaru Baja pickup with a camper shell. It fits perfectly.The latch is horribly fragile. Never latch it unless you need to as you will have about a dozen snaps before it breaks. The replacement parts cost $15 with shipping and handling. They should be mailed free because of their pathetic design defect. You can always string a bungie cord between the handles to keep it closed. ;)"
1,Cheap stories about bondage,"It should be noted that this book is a compilation of personal tales involving male on male bondage practices. The Publisher's Afterword gives probably the best description of the book: ""All of the accounts of school, frat, team and club initiations in this book originally appeared in the reader-written male bondage magazine, Bound & Gagged, and in two of its special publications, Pledges and Paddles Volume 1 and Volume 2.""If you are looking for poorly written male on male bondage stories, you might want to read this book. However, if you are looking for any sort of academic discussion about hazing in contemporary America, do not waste your time."
1,IRREGULAR SIZE - NOT AS EXPECTED,"Not the same Swaddlers size 2 as if I to buy them at local retail store. Diapers missing 2 expanded siding, therefore, the diaper do not fit right. I bought 5 pack, but want to return 4 pack since the 1st package I already opened and use."
5,Healing Yourself with the Healer of Harrow Point,"Peter Walpole uses the imagery of a boy on the verge of manhood to mirror for us all the times of transition in our lives. Emma is Thomas' spiritual guru through his journey. Ultimately, the lessons he learns about himself transcend the simple physical healing that Emma strives to teach him. The book is beautifully written and captures the fire within all of us. Although it is targeted for ""young adults"" I think it will speak more directly to those of us who have already passed through various stages of our lives. This is a book to read with your teenage children to use as a springboard into a number of discussions about growing up and relationships."
4,Chased by Dinosaurs,Great entertainment! I did enjoy watching it. I look forward to trying the other videos.
4,Very much enjoyed,"The child this was purchased for enjoyed this very, very much. Wanted to know if there were more of these. Little did he know I had bought the whole series!!!"
4,Poetic Art Rock,"All the Talking Heads trademarks are here, where they still sound fresh: unusual song structures, weird lyrics, pained vocals and jagged rhythms, forever establishing their unique style. My favourites include The Girls Want To Be With The Girls, I'm Not In Love, Take Me To The River (sounding like some type of anthem) and the wonderful The Big Country. I have not yet investigated their debut album, but this charmed me way back in 1978. I rated them in the same league as Television, Patti Smith, Richard Hell and the Voidoids - music with poetic substance - as opposed to the 3-chord punk wonders. Yes, this music has stood the test of time."
3,OK for the price,"I bought this with a coordinating rug, and while the color of the set is not what I thought it'd be (it's always hard to judge color from a computer screen) the real disappointment is the size. It's too small to fit what I believe is a fairly standard size; the only lids I've seen that this would actually fit are antiques (and tiny)."
3,ehhh,"it could have been made with better product, it feels really cheesy. my brother keeps calling me japanese, i dont know why. (im korean.) but i bought it for some reason."
2,As Ned would say.. PreDiddly-Ictable!,"Of course One expects a formulaic novel when you read a romance, but Ride a Dark Horse is a repeat of the same scenes over and over again. The woman and the man smooch then they fight, the woman rides the horse brilliantly, the woman and the man smooch and fight, then the woman rides the horse brilliantly, and so on and so on.The author knows her stuff where horses are concerned, but the tedious, unoriginal romance between two wounded, but otherwise flawless characters is like reading through mud. I LOVE adult horse books. If you want a grown up version of those young adult books we know and love, read Riders by Jilly Cooper, or Trophies by Ainsley Sheridan."
4,Sexy Cowboy love story,This book is for the romantic and the horny. It has a great story line with lots of info on horses and racing. The characters are lovable and relatable; strong characteristically and full of good wit. Fun and sexy with lots of intimate details of their sexual encounters. Feel-good book with lots of heart.
1,Not up to par,"This book, as well as Mr. Shaara's previous effort about WWI, did not live up to my expectations. His prequel and sequel to The Killer Angels didn't skip a beat from his father's memorable novel about the conflict at Gettysburg and that momentum carried over to his tale of the US-Mexican War and his 2-novel series on the American Revolution. Perhaps it was those lofty expectations that left me disappointed with his most recent work. After 2+ years, I have yet to finish The Rising Tide as I have been unable to immerse myself into this story -something that would occur naturally for the reader in his early works. I do hope that after the WWII series is completed, he goes back to his roots and is able to find the inner storyteller that captivated us all as in Gods and Generals and The Last Full Measure."
3,War Novel,"I purchased the three books in this series by Jeff Shaara. I read about half of The Rising Tide and became weary with the expletives used in the book. While it is not what we call ""hard"" or vulgar profanity, I just don't like having to read it. I prefer not subjecting my eyes and mind to this kind of language. I will not be reading the other two books. I will probably take them to a used book store or give them to Goodwill Industries."
3,Sometimes you gotta slog...,"Jeff Shaara really likes the gory political details behind the scenes of the major battles he describes. Sometimes I had to slog through what seemed to be really dull to me. There was enough action to keep me interested, and Shaara does a good job giving both the big picture and the details on the ground."
2,"History, si, novel, no","Mr. Shaara is a terrific writer, and if he set out to write non fiction histories of wars I'm sure his work would stand up with the best of the genre. However, as a novel, this one, ""The Rising Tide"" left me cold. In fact, I was unable to finish the book. I found it dry, factual, and frankly boring. I mean, the war was over 65 years ago. The allies won. So facts and figures and drawings of battle plans and casualty figures just aren't that compelling. At this point it doesn't matter much how many tanks Rommel commanded and how many tanks Montgomery or Patton commanded. I wanted a story about the men who fought those tanks and the infrantry soldiers who fought alongside them!I was looking for a good novel about the men and women who fought the war, told from their viewpoints. Something I could get emotionally involved with.I say again, good book as a dry history. As a novel, not so hot."
4,"Good quality, good price.","I bought the S-video cable set because my television has an S-video connector, but doesn't have component video inputs. These cables and connectors are very good quality, and the set includes the S-video and two audio cables, so it's all you need to connect your DVD player. My DVD player included a composite video cable, but it would definitely be ""the weakest link"" in my system. I didn't pay a fortune for the player, but I do want to see the best quality picture that it, and my tv, are capable of displaying."
1,A Guide to....wasting your money,Absolutely worthless book. An attempt to make a guide for all possible outsourcing situations -and as a result it gives few ideas and nothing really useful.
5,Boys got me hooked,"I have 3 boys they kept asking me to watch this red vs blue with them, finally gave in, loved the original season i loved the lame jokes been a fan ever since the ever 1st episode that you had to watch ONLY on the Xbox 360 then to YouTube ( which didn't buffer right half time) I Love that I can download season 10 and i can watch it on any device i own my iPad, play station 3, 60"" HD TV, cell phone with amazon instant video, so much better then dvd, when I'm bored I can pull up red vs blue on my phone anytime, anywhere I can watch it over & over especially season 10 has lot of clues about next season and is the director carolines dad? I got watch that again"
5,last season,"number ten season is great way to end the red vs blue, it answer all past seasons that leave you hanging."
2,Another disappointing Valentino biography,"Although more thoroughly researched than most of its predecessors, sadly Leider's book joins the long line of failed bios of Valentino. It not only mis-states facts but the interpretations are often just as wrong. Leider's conclusion, ""Valentino helped deflower postwar America,"" must take its place in the purple-prose hall of shame. Michael Morris's 1991 book, Madame Valentino, on Valentino's wife, Natacha Rambova, set a standard with its accurate exploration of their relationship and his historical and critical discussion of the Valentino films. That standard is unmet by Leider, leaving the task of a truly commendable biography of Valentino himself still to be undertaken."
2,400-500 Page Tabloid,"I have read 6 books about Rudolph Valentino and after a long waint I am disappointed with Ms. Leider's book. There is nothing enlightening or literary about it. Ms. Leider states on page 8 that if ""Valentino could be precisely definged, his appeal would diminish. I did learn more about his troubled childhood, his close friends, events of the Mineralava Tour and the details of his business negotions. Ms. Leider has done extensive research but some of theses sources could be slanted or erroneous. So we have a chatty, gossipy book about what everyone had to say about him. To the Amazaon com reveiwer who called Rudy a lightweight; Mr. Valentino was fluent in 3 languages, he had a large library of books, he was a sportsman, an accomplished horseman, and had tastes for art and history.`He was somewhat of the dilletante Ms. Leider's book is a book for the nineties in which people were defined by their faults and weaknesses, rather than their disposition or motivations."
1,another sleeper,"From what I've heard from John Norum, I was excited to hear he would be playing on this album. I don't know if Don was suppressing the guitar on this album or not, but John doesn't get a chance to shine. This is a total sleeper. Why does Don Dokken keep putting these psychedelic, Beatlesque sounding songs on his albums? Where did his voice go? It's so soft and meodic. Is it too much to ask for an album to rock? I've read the other reviews and, no, this album does not rock and its not a return to the classic Dokken sound. Some bands can progress and some cannot. Here, the latter holds true. He had such a powerhouse of players in Norum/Sparks that I thought this album would have some life to it. Sadly it has none. There are a couple of songs where the guitar takes off, but sadly it's in the final 3 seconds of the song ending and fading out. What the hell has happend to this band?"
3,Underrated,"After just getting into Dokken via the Flashback cd, I heard about how great the Lynch/Pilson cd was. I also heard how bad Dokken was since 95. I've owned Dysfunction for years and never liked it, but I was curious to hear Long Way Home.This album really is not that bad, it just sounds very different from classic Dokken. The first track is pretty good, much better then anything on the Lynch/Pilson cd. Some of the rockers on here are just ok, but there isn't anything I'd say is bad. The ballads here really stand out. Not exceptional, but good. Certainly very good for a band in this stage of their career.This is a very solid album, and I feel it's not given a fair shake due to not sounding like classic Dokken. It also doesn't have Lynch and Pilson, but the lead player on here is really good.If you like hard rock music and aren't hungup on something with the Dokken name having to have George Lynch while also sounding like classic Dokken, give it a try."
4,Not what I usually like...I should hate this CD.,"I really like rockin' tunes. I just don't like slower non-heavy songs. But I listen to this CD and think that it is not what I usually like, but everytime I put it on, I really find myself enjoying the songs. It is more of a Don solo than classic Dokken, but I still like it. I just can't explain why. I really recommend trying to listen to several songs before buying it becuase many seem to really really hate this CD. However, you could be like me and be pleasantly surprised."
5,Not their 80's style but a very well written rock CD,"Dokken had a few [bad] albums in the 90's that sounded like they were trying to sound ""alternative"" & then they went back to their old sound with ERASE THE SLATE around 2 years ago. That was a good album & suprisingly LONG WAY HOME is better! The album is different from Erase so be warned, don't expect the high pitch vocals and squeeling guitars. The whole album is consistently good and has a good mixture of fast, medium, and slow songs. I play this CD all the time, it really grew on me around the 3rd time through. I play it in my store and tell people about it since this type of music is ""underground"" now as nobody knows it is out there and it gets ZERO airplay unfortunately.Noah"
2,A gurl wit style from Nebraska,Being the 11-year-old that I am~this CD isn't very good b-cuz there is only like one song that I have heard of off this CD~but Having the kind of tast that I do~if you are about 16 or 17 you would like this CD
3,Get your Books early!,"Amazon did really well on the shape of the book. But it took about 3 to four weeks to get the book, since they were back ordered. The price was one of the cheapest to the other buyers."
4,Wonderful Project to take on,"I have seen this production twice onstage and both times were captivating. Both - college lab productions. Scary, intriguing and nicely written."
3,Great Style; Missing Something,"What I loved about this book was the chilling gothic style of it, but what I didn't like was the book what some of the language didn't match up with the Victorian age. The Lady In Black is an atmospheric novel that reminds me a lot of The Turn of the Screw in the way it was written and what it was trying to do, but it just doesn't live up to that standard. It's a quick read and you can probably get through it in one sitting but at the end there just seems to be more questions than answers. While I enjoy the style of this book and the writing really matched that of a Victorian novel; there was just so much in the book that held this book back for me."
