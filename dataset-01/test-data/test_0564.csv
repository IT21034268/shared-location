2,Thank Buddha I Had A Glock !!!!!!,"I just got this book and WOW! What a revelation! There are a lot of guns out there and a lot of nervous itchy trigger-fingers. Buddhism teaches that One must be mindful of one's surroundings and stay alert. And always be compassionate and kind. But if attacked, blast the hell outta them! What a Rush! Me and my Glock. In conclusion,I, for one, used the book afterwards for target practice."
4,Good read,This book presents many different real life self defense scenarios. Each one is different and it shows what ordinary people do in in different life threatening situations and it also talks about what happens afterwards. Very informative book.
4,Outrageous!,"I guiltily confess to enjoying this show, which features several wealthy women from Beverly Hills. It is eye-opening and often eye-watering to see how the 1% lives. In one memorable episode, one of the women spent $50,000 on a birthday party for her four year-old! A party that was clearly intended to impress the adults rather than entertain the children.However, it is also apparent that money truly does not buy happiness!"
1,What da hell is this????,"Yo!!! this cat cant be serious. He better go condition or somthin.This is not a album and Roy is not a rapper.Dont get me wrong i like Roy in the ring,but when he tries to bring that to da mic it's pure garbage.He has no style and his rhymes are just a little elementery. He had to put this together wit his own money. I could tell from the single ""Yall must have forgot"" that Roy was making a big mistake. This is not a album.I don't care how many titles you hold thats not what i want to hear when i put in my CD.I know he got his chest nice 6 pack and all that but any medeocore mc can eat duke up wit no problem.Of course since he's Roy he's gonna get some kinda respect.he's a good dude,he just cant rap."
2,Roy is the BEST Pound-for-Pound fighter in the world...,"Trinidad is lucky he lost against Hopkins, because Roy would have DECAPITATED him!! And he ALREADY beat Hopkins...!! Get real, boxing press... Roy Jones is the best fighter in the universe."
1,Please don't buy it!,"It's the worst thing I ever bought from Amazon.Apparently The Amazing Jo Jo is a living legend (according to the back of the dvd box) and ""redefine"" street magic for the masses! What does this mean and do ten to fifteen people (mostly off screen) constitute ""the masses""?The quality of the recording is dreadful, the camera work is basic in the extreme and the ""real live magic"" is actually a series of standard tricks that you can see almost any amateur magician do. To call it the ""greatest show of the streets is a barefaced lie and an insult to the hundreds of brilliant street acts (many of whom I book for festivals all over Europe.) It cost me $27 and runs for 18 minutes. My advice is don't buy it..."
1,Back with HELL,I was looking forward to this CD. What a mistake it is terrible - It shows none of the culture or class of the original Road to Hell.Mr Rea has done some excellent stuff in his time but this noise is simply cashing in on the title of a great album. My advice; give this a miss - it is HELL to listen to!
4,Half NOTHING!,This album seems to be a very eclectic collection of fun and happy-go-lucky tunes. Cool for your late-night hangout or mood moving morning needs
4,"Cuban, Rhythmic and Hot!","Maria Victoria's talent comes through in this CD. She is exhuberant, flashy and sings her Cuban Sons with incredibly entertaining gusto. From originals to classics, this is a very danceable CD. The production leaves something to be desired, you feel her backup should be stronger. However, if you want an upbeat, good time latin CD, this one's for you."
3,Be wary of printing large documents.,"Works exactly as advertised, awesome on single page documents. However, as I often print in excess of 10 pages at a time, I sometimes see printing artifacts when printing large documents off of just the battery. When plugged in, the artifacts disappear. I would still purchase this in the future, but do some experiments when you get it to see if you have this issue."
3,What A CD! I Tell Ya!,Were else would you get such a sweet cd but amazon.com this is a powerful cd with cool people. www.zip-e.tk
2,not very good,Poor introduction and background. Low-budget film that has few locations. Mr. T can't act unless it is humorous. The lawyers acted well. The story just wasn't very good.
3,Judgement - the DVD,"It was a farily good movie. The thematic matter was powerful - and it does talk about what will happen and is happening already. It's too bad people don't take this stuff more seriously. Most of us have been too distracted by the worldly stuff - and see this as a jesus freak"" movie.Sadly - it tells about what will happen - and sadder still - no one wants to change it."
2,Design flaws abound,"The sound out of this unit is terrible. It's hollow with virtually no bass. Setting the time isn't very intuitive. It's hard to remember which side wheel is for volume and which is the analog (not digital) radio tuner. The power button doesn't really need to be there; rather there should be a switch setting for off. Speaking of the switch selector, it's a real problem when you want to go to sleep listening to one thing and wake up with another. For example, I can't fall asleep listening to a CD without the alarm being set to play the CD. I have to switch it to the alarm buzzer if I want to have the buzzer wake me. Can't recommend it."
1,CD stopped working after 11 months,"Bought this for our baby's room so we could pay CD's when he goes to sleep. The CD play stopped working after 11 months. I made sure it was not the CD itself and it wasn't. Also put a few different CD's in and the unit just spins and starts to play for about 5 seconds than the CD just stops.I would not recommend this since it cost so much. If you really want a CD, go to BigLots and buy something from there 1/2 the price."
4,easy to use,"I like the dual alarm, and how easy it is to set everything. I don't really use the cd player much, so it doesn't bother me that it only starts on the first song for the cd alarm. I use the radio. My station doesn't always come in well on radios, but it does on this one. The sound quality in general could be slightly better, which is why I gave it a four instead of a five, but it still works great for an alarm radio. It looks nice on my desk and isn't too bulky considering the CD player. I would buy it again."
2,radio,"I was disappointed and that the radio does not shut off when the cd is through playing. The power stays on. The built in antenna is not strong enough to pick up stations in knoxville and static is bad,would I purchase this item again. The answer is no"
3,"""Sleep"" function doesn't work with ""buzzer"" mode","In general I am happy with the product. Only thing I don't like is that you can't use the ""sleep"" function to fall asleep to a CD or radio if you want to wake to the buzzer. You have to have the product in ""buzzer"" mode to use that for the alarm. To listen to the CD or radio with the ""sleep"" function, you have to switch it to ""CD"" or ""radio"" mode, but then you can't use the ""buzzer"" mode to wake unless you switch it back to buzzer before falling asleep--which then shuts off the CD or radio."
3,Battery Back Up DOES NOT include alarm,"the battery backup is only good for when the power comes back on, then your clock and alarm is reset, if the power goes out & stays out when your supposed to wake up your out of luck, the alarm will not sound even with the ""battery backup"". Otherwise a very nice looking model and worked fine, but returned for another model w/ a real backup and more quality sounding speakers for playing cd's --Timex Nature/MP3 Clock Radio - T617S"" Electronics."
2,Returned item,"Might have kept this item, but the LCD was so bright it interferred with my sleep. there's no adjustment for brightness."
1,Terrible Customer Service-Poor Quality,"I received a similar clock radio as a gift (model AJ3980/37). The CD player didnt work but the radio and alarm did function okay. Customer service is a nightmare to work with. After hours of hold time and talking with uncooperative customer service agents, and after getting my sister from 3 states away to fax them the Amazon receipt, they still didnt want to help me. Finally after asking to talk with a supervisor they agreed to replace it, but only if we paid for shipping! After learning from other reviews that the CD players on these radios have loud mechanical noises and often fail, we are not sure if it is worth sending it in for replacement. We would rate it at 0 stars if 0 stars was an option.We will never purchase another Philips product again and advise others to do the same."
3,"Good graphics, tired gameplay","well,I just purchased this game alittle while ago,and the reason for the low rating is because while this game offers great graphics and story,the gameplay is a bit repetitive and tired.However,if you are a fan of the Chronicles Of Pern series,this title is highly recommended.one thing I can't get past though is that the gaemplay s a bit slow,and the loading times are a bit long.Overall,I'd say it's a good rental at best."
1,Wow this game is awful,One of the reviewers referred to this game as similar to Shenmue. It's a story based game and that's where the similarities end. This game is BRUTAL. Thank the lord only eight other people have reviewed this game because no one should have to play this. The loading screens alone make it unplayable. You can take a shower while your waiting for the screen to load in between room changes. Your character moves like a garbage truck moving through an alley on a snow day. The environments couldn't be more confusing. You don't even get to actually fly the dragon. I was offended that amazon recommended this game to me. I haven't read the books but I'm sure they're better than playing this garbage. If you want a dragon game go play Panzer dragoon. Even for the 90's this game is unacceptable.
1,One of the worst Dreamcast games I've played,"Sub-standard graphics, slow, choppy animation, bad (hokey) voice-acting, boring game. Warning: this game is really bad. The only people who will like it are die-hard ""Pern"" fanatics who don't care if they're playing a horrible game as long as it's set in the Dragon Riders world. This is absolutely one of the worst Dreamcast games I've ever played."
3,sophmore effort not as intense,"i feel in love with the character of jack daniels in the first novel, whiskey sour. she is well written, has human qualities, and handles herself well (meaning she doesn't fall prey to the typical stereo typical female role of whining and crying and falling apart). in this book, i had the killer figured out in less than 5 chapters, and predicted Herb's actions about 10 pages in. and jack? she turned into the typical female stereo type. it was most disappointing. mr. konrath, bring jack back the way you intended her! this, however, won't stop me from reading the next installment, ""rusty nail."" i won't give up hope on jack!"
4,A Very Good Read,I thought it was well written and enjoyed the humor and the pathos of Jack in the romance and Mom world!
5,Avoids the sophomore slump,"I really enjoyedWhiskey Sour, so I had high hopes for Bloody Mary. I was not disappointed!Bloody Mary is a real page turner. There's plenty of action and thrills, and another creepy criminal. But Konrath goes beyond the typical crime thriller formula and gives us even more insight into Jack Daniels and her life. And like Whiskey Sour, we're treated to more comedic interchanges between Jack and the other characters.A lot of cop stories read like Superman comics. The protagonist is always infallible, and an expert in everything from computer science to martial arts. Jack Daniels is, well, less-than-perfect. But that's precisely what makes it so easy for the reader to empathize with her. We see a bit of ourselves in her, and we're drawn in that much more."
4,I'm really enjoying this series,"These books are very cleverly written. They are humorous, quirky, and the Herb and Jack dynamic is priceless. Harry McGlade is also an entertaining, if gross, character. The plot for this particular book has been already been discussed numerous times here, so I won't get into that. For those who want to know the sex, language, or violence content: Yes, there is violence, some of it a bit on the gruesome side, which is to be expected for this genre. There is some language, but it by no means dominates the book (the same cannot be said for far too many crime fiction books out there), and there are no detailed sexcapades, although there is the occasional off-colored comment/innuendo (most of which comes from Harry McGlade). These books have the ability to make me laugh out loud. That's rare for me, and is one of the reasons I like them so much."
2,Clumsy design at best.,"The picture looks a lot more sleek than the product actually is. At 25 1/2"" in overall width...the carrier is too wide for narrow trails in the woods. 20"" would have been better. When extended, the folding part does not secure, but is held in place by the weight of the carcass. This makes for a clumsy operation setting it up and carrying it to the field when empty. I returned mine to Cabela's where I bought it. Two stars is generous."
4,"Absolutely fantastic no fat, no sugar bread",Absolutely delicious bread - even my son eats it. Easy to understand and most ingredients are available in Australia. Works great in my new Breville Breadmaker
5,SIMPLY PERFECT!!,"I just ordered another copy - I have given my past three copies to friends in their times of need. I consider this book a gift from God. Simply written and sometimes brutally direct, any page will enlighten your day. Undoubtedly the best gift in the smallest package I have ever received!"
4,"Leehom is ""Unbelieveable""","Any Leehom Wang fan will love this CD. Great ""Chinked Out"" music, as Leehom calls it. Several soft, romantic love songs as well."
2,Works for a year,"This is a great product for short term use. It works very well to hang pictures etc.The problem I have with this product is that in about an year, liquid inside evaporated leaving a big bubble. Now it is pretty useless since the bubble inside is too big to align it well. I have given it two stars because I would expect a bit longer life for this product. It explains why the warranty is for only one year."
2,Not what I expected.....,"This item is pretty worthless. It has a very weak laser, cheaply made and doesn't project a good line at all."
3,Too many celebrities,"While I enjoyed several parts of this DVD, it just doesn't feel very cohesive -- either to me or my 2 1/2 year old. The director seems to cater to the celebrities who do cameos here to such an extent that the storyline tries to function like a sitcom. The jokes were either stupid or they required an awareness of pop culture that my preschooler just does not have. ""Stiller the Elf"" (voice of Ben Stiller) is particularly uninspiring, and having Santa wear fingerless black leather gloves and act in very un-Santa-ish ways turned off both me and my kiddo. I really wish that Kevin Clash (rather than Joey Mazzarino) had produced and directed this one, since he seems to have a much better feel for what parents and their children will be willing watch the fifty or sixty minimal viewings that all Elmo DVDs get."
2,Just okay,"Elmo and Abby are adorable, as usual. Ben Stiller is really funny and the cameo's are mostly good. Jennifer Hudson's song was really annoying though. Just fyi, there is at least one christian song on the movie so if you are looking for something purely secular you might want to take that into consideration-I didn't know that when I bought the dvd."
2,Elmo,"My toddler daughter did not find this movie interesting. It lost her attention after just ten minutes. I was also somewhat put-off by the language of the ""Ben Stiller"" character."
4,amazingly prescient -- or is it?,"The copyright page discloses that this book was first published in 1963, and yet on page 180 there is a reference to the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. The copyright page makes no references to any revisions having been made to the original version, but obviously there have been some. I'd like to know if these revisions were made by Tevis himself, and when were they done, and why? And has anything else been added to the text since its original publication? Why does Del Rey not disclose that this is a revised edition, and not the original?"
3,Mezmerising stereo mixes of what could have been.,"The key to this particular Procol release is in the stereo mixes of songs from the first album that we've only been able to hear in mono up until now. Granted, these are alternative takes and probably recorded early in the creative process. But listening to ""Conquistador,"" ""Something Following Me,"" ""Cerdes (Outside the Gates Of),"" ""Kaleidoscope"" and ""Repent Walpurgis"" in full-blown stereo for the first time is a revelation. It offers a tantalizing aural glimpse of what Procol's legendary (and horribly produced in mono only) first album could have sounded like in stereo."
3,attention: freezing babies!!,"I have something really similar i used to use for my 18 months old. It's lovely, but since the water that comes out of the hose is really cold even in summer, my kid was always cold and will get tired of playing with it real fast, even in the hot sun of wv.I am looking now for a small pool so i can let the sun heat the water and then let my toddler and my new baby splash in it!Oh! and it is pretty hard to completely empty the inside of it. I never really did!"
3,Average product,This knife is made in China and is of average quality. The engraved marking on the side was defective (only cosmetic). The blade is very thick and not good for fine work. It is also better designed for chopping than cutting. You could chop up a fish but not fillet it. The handle slips at the end only. Good for camping but not really a survival knive.
2,LIFELESS,"This recording is so bad they should pay people to buy it. It has great standards like MALAGUENA, MEXICAN HAT DANCE and LA BAMBA. Is this the orchestra that gave us The Soul of Spain a few decades back? The recorded sound is awful. The interpretations lack lustre and life. The basic rhythms are there, but no life, no gusto. Sorry maestro, back to square one."
4,The Greatest Horse Stories Ever Told: Thirty Unforgettable Horse Tales,"The book was received in the time specified and it was in very good condition.I gave the book to my granddaughter so I can't recommend the contents, but itlooks like a good book."
5,"""OUT STANDING!""","I've never been in the armed forces but I love miliary marches.I use this CD when walking on the treadmill at the gym. You'll be smiling at some of the cadences, and laughing at other times. This is the BEST work out CD ever! You can march (walk) to this CD easily. You'll think the drill sargent is right beside you!GO MARINES!!!"
5,Great read!,I loved this book as I visited the Orkney Islands this past summer. It made the experience complete. Made me feel as if I were there again.
3,Raed This Story Now,"Every mouse wife has a man,but Miss.Gary had one.But then he dead of a mousetrap,the next one dead of a cat,the last one dead of poison! Miss.Gray also had three children and she swore that the trins, the three children, will destroy the famer and the cats.One day Kevin, an outside mouse,was token into the house,but he got away! The trins then found him and toke him to their home. there he saw Miss.Gray.So if you want to now what happens nexts read The Terreible Trins."
3,Helpful,"Being newly diagnosed with Asperger's, this book was a great guide to helping me understand the disorder. It did not, however, have much in the way of ""solutions"" as the title suggests. The focus was more on personality traits and challenges an Aspie might have, and very little time was spent discussing what to do about it.It is a great starting point for newly-diagnosed Aspies and their family members."
3,Not the best season,"Let me start by saying I am a huge Grey's anatomy fan. I love the show, I never miss a thursday night watching it. But season 4 I have to say is the worst season they have had so far. I don't know if it is because of the actor's strike, or if the writer was too stressed writing scripts for this show and for private practice. But this show can and has been so much better. In fact, I already think season 5 has bypassed this one."
5,never gets old,What dramtic season!! and All the drama and changes that happened during this season.. i love this show!!! from season 1 to season 9!! it never gets old~~
2,Trashy trashy,This show just keeps getting worse. I'm so sick of the same old drama that they are playing over and over again. I will NOT be buying the next season. Too much trashiness.
1,Not True To Form,"As a true Alias junkie, this book was a complete disappointment. The author is obviously not a fan of the show nor has she ever read any of the other books. Reading this book was painstacking for me. I usually count the days down until each book release, but if she writes another I won't even waste the money.Heart-Broken"
1,I Want My Money Back,"Just as the Alias series had been gaining strength and becoming more interesting, this book comes along. The characters are boring, the action sequences are rediculous, and the plot is almost non-existant.. As a die-hard fan of Alias, I wish I wouldn't have spent my money on this."
2,This book is very boring .,This book tells that was the family who found this baby. The little baby is with the family for a long time. Until the babys mother comes and takes her away. After a few years the girl and her mother come back to live with the family who found the baby.
5,Filling in the gaps,"This book not only fills in the gaps on history it tells the story of how the gaps on our maps were filled in. From the wastelands of the Sahara to the northwest passage in Canada this book chronicles the adventures and misadventures of the men who dared to do the impossible. On Shoestring budgets these people went literally to the ends of the earth to fill in 'pointless' parts of the map. Yet without them we would never know what lurks in the extremes of our world. This is a grand tribute to English fortitude and daring the mapping of these savage areas had never been attempted or done before because no people, and no country had the guts to send men into such extremes of human endurance.For more information on Arcitc exploration read 'Arctic Grail' which covers the period up to 1909.Told as best it could be told, in flowing language this is a lovely account of human daring and folly."
2,Misfit,"I have a 1998 BMW 323ic (E36) and want I bit more power out of it. I found a great price on Amazon and they sent a kit they said would fit. It arrived quickly with only compression damage on the kit box - the shipping box was the same size...I spent almost three hours trying to install it. Instructions said to replace all the intake hoses but none of the replacements were the correct diameter. Using original hoses, I got the adapter and filter to the approximate place of where the metal baffle was supposed to be but then the baffle required extremely odd angles to avoid the radiator and sheet metal. To top it all off, the instructions pictured a dissimilar space, non-existent and differently shaped mounting points. I finaly gave up.Amazon uses UPS for returns so, I had to drive 40 miles to find an open shop (the huge box does not fit in a drop box). While K&N; offers a fine product, no one will tell me yet what fits. This has been a most unpleasant experience."
5,"better than Homework!! (no, really!)","While not as deep as Homework, ""Discovery"" is definitely more fun to listen to."
3,Cable,This cable is exactly as described. What can anyone really say about a Cale? It is what it is. Hasn't failed yet.
3,OK but nothing special,"As a long time NBA fan I bought this book looking forward to a plethora of ""inside"" information regarding the players, the organizations, and behind the scenes stories. Instead, what I got was a collection of stories and vignettes that have been told and re-told numerous times. This book is a nice look back at the draft and the careers of HOFers Jordan, Barkley, and Stockton, but other than the fact that Bill Fitch hated Elvin Hayes I didn't learn anything new or gain any insight."
2,This book is not practical for todays cook.,"I am of 100% Czech heritage and have many authentic recipes. This book uses ingredients not readily found. Especially the pastry recipes do not use flours, etc. found in most kitchens. There are better recipes geared to todays methods and ingredients. Mace and nutmeg were commonly used and are not in these recipes.I was generally disappointed in the content and referances to basic mixtures and adaptations. There were a few appealing recipes, but the majority were not for todays cook."
3,Not perfect; but not bad,"Overall it's an interesting and thorough comprehensive rehashing of the Titanic sinking. I think he did go overboard in several of his assumptions. e.g. There is no indication from other sources that Major Arthur Peuchen cut a poor figure socially. I've read all the Toronto papers published during that week from the sinking to after the Carpathia docked and though his name was not mentioned as frequently as Mr. Charles Hays, it was near the top of every list of Canadians who were known to be on the ship, usually without explanation of who he was - so he was certainly well known in his home city, which was even then a substantial place. So, if the author assumes unsubstaniated things about one passenger's social standing, can I trust him fully when he discusses the disaster?"
5,The most informative analysis of the Titanic anywhere!,"I am pleased that Mr. Butler not only recounts the actual, rather familiar incident on board the greatest ocean liner ever made, but also describes in great detail the events leading up to and following the Titanic's fateful night. This book is certainly a must-read for all Titanic buffs, and also for people who simply who wish to know more than just the same story we have heard so many times, from so many sources. Therefore, I give this book five stars."
2,"Read ""A Night to Remember"" instead","Mr. Butler appears to have taken a good deal from Walter Lord's ""A Night to Remember."" One would expect much more from someone claiming to have researched an issue for 30 some years. What concerns me most is the issue of credibility. Some of Mr. Butler's claims as to education, military, etc., cannot be verified. Thie leads one to wonder what else is ""fiction"" while reading the book. When reading something written by an historian, one must feel confident that one is reading truth, in all it's facets. This cannot be clouded by questions relating to other non-related ares; however, I found myself questioning simply due to this. I wanted to read the book and believe it, but the nagging questions were always present. Similarities to A Night to Remember would lead me to recommend one skip this book, and read A Night to Remember instead."
4,GoodBook,"Vey good book from a different point, Not just the regular Titanic story. If you have read other Tiantic books -- you need toread this one."
1,Well Avoid,"Butler has copied Walter Lord's book almost word for word, unfortunately it is no where as good and chock full of errors. Avoid!"
1,Shut Up,"All this guy talks about for the entire cd is about evil prostitutes. Was his mother one or somehting. Why does this guy hate woman sooo much. Its a bit extreme. And all the guys on every review are like oh i can relate to what hes saying oh i love this cd. If you do then your probably an ugly looser who has never had a girlfreind, or a total wimp in bed leading to all your girlfreinds to dump you. And your last resort was a prostitute who probably charged you way extra but you paid it because you soooo desperate and you are fed up of dating Mrs. Hand and her 5 daughters. Or maybe your mommy hit you all the time and now your a woman beater. Im serious thats all this guy talks about."
5,GLASSJAAAAAAAAAAW!,"When I first heard them about 3 years ago, I was a lil hesitant at first...I personally was not used to the style of music. It is completely different from anything else I've ever heard. It's one of THE best cds I own..... I'm sick of people calling them 'emo' because they really don't fall under that category...but if that's what you wanna call it...go right ahead..call it what you want it still ... ownsThey are a VERY VERY VERY good band live, by the way.Very unique and pretty darn... talented young men"
5,The album that changed my life,"Back in the summer of '02 I picked this cd up on the advice of a friend and it completely changed my outlook on life, not to say that this is an uplifting album, but it came at a time where I felt very alone and misunderstood as a result of a depression spawned by 3 failed relationships within a year and a half. Basically this album made me stop feeling sorry for myself, and the sheer emotion combined with harsh and bitter relationship-spurned lyrics displayed by frontman Daryl Palumbo hit me like a ton of bricks. I really can't find the words to express my appreciation for this album, but the first time I held this cd will always be a lasting memory for me"
5,genre whore,"There are many types of ""hardcore"" music, not just hardcore punk. Glassjaw originated from themselves; they sound like no other band, and are much more ""hardcore"" sounding (in terms of what the actual slang of the word means) than any of the bands you mentioned.Who cares about genres, and who started what? Glassjaw does it best. And to the spotlight reviewer: ever been betrayed by someone you love? Yeah, it tends to make you swear a lot.This is not nu-metal either. Nu-metal is Spineshank, Korn, and other overproduced cookie-cutters. This is Glassjaw."
3,Different...,"At a minimum, I can say that I found Glassjaw to be very original. That said, take this to heart: if you don't like it the 1st time you hear it, listen to it again (& again if necessary).The 1st time that I heard this cd, I hated it & stored it in the ""waste of money"" pile. However, after I listened to ""Everything ..."" a few more times, I was hooked. Their songs are heavy, and most are quite good & complex. On this CD, the complexity of the songs works very well (unlike Mudvayne).Before buying this CD, you might want to listen to some sample 1st."
1,Mens Passion Hair Magazine volume 75,I design custom made hair to fit the needs of each client. I do have gay clients but most of them are not. This styling book is close to gay porn. Models are posing with out their shirts on and it looks like my gay clients would really like this but my straight clients hate this book.
2,Let down,"I thought this looked so cute and perfect for my niece for Christmas, but boy was I disappointed! I ended up purchasing something else for my niece as I was too ashamed to give her this. Many of the thingies on top to hold the thread were crooked, but they seemed to be easy to square up with a bit of manipulation. The drawers don't square up very cleanly, but they did hold their contents properly. Overall, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of deals I suppose. Being I don't sew at all, I can't say much more than that. I am keeping the item simply because it's the only sewing stuff under the roof and maybe one day I can use it. The thread would make for festive dental floss and the wooden portion would make great kindling for a bonfire or something, but I wouldn't roast a marshmallow over it."
4,As the Title Projects,"Messenger's D-Day Atlas has many maps that are very easily read and the text within the book itself is very well written. If you are looking for a good overview of the invasion and it's aftermath, complete with anecdotes and easy to follow maps, then this is a book that you should be happy with."
2,Woefully out-of-date,"The author refers to the ""microcomputer"" and suggests you consider purchasing a modem and getting to know your library's card catalog. Sure, it's always good to choose the right adviser, but any book can tell you that. Get something more recent."
5,The best!,This has to be the best thing for a mans face when shaving. The smoothest shave I have ever had in my life. Great product. I found it in England last year and I loved it so I was real happy when I found it on Amazon.com.Good work Amazon.com keep those great product choices coming.
5,Great Product,Great shaving gel - I have pretty uneven skin from an old scar and have sampled a lot of shaving creams and gels - this is the one I like best.
1,Not as described,The dimensions of the product were not as described. The descriptions says the dimensions are 11.5 x 11.5 x 7 inches. The actual diameter was 8.5 inches and the actual depth was 5.5 inches. Spaghetti will clearly not fit in this pot and it was not what I wanted. I returned it without using it.
3,KitchenAid Gourmet Reserved Hard Anodized 4.5 qt Saucepot,"Not bad for the price, the only downside is the description did not include the fact the saucepot has a ""non-stick"" coating inside...which doesn't hold up as well as cookware hard anodized inside and out."
1,Cardboard Jazz,"I did not enjoy this CD. Jane's voice while technically good, lacks a sense of soul, humour or pathos, and is uninvolving. The arrangements are slow in tempo, after two or three songs your praying for somethig to lift this record out of its depressing monotony. Unfortunatly it never arrives. I'd love to give more information but I can't bare to listen to this again."
5,Beautiful cd,"Bought the cd and was so happy to hear and understand every word being sung. The talent is great. I noticed back up singers,so looked up the liner notes, and was surprised to see that Ms. Monheit supplied the three part harmony herself.(Dindi) When I heard ""Never Let Me Go"", I realized that I had a lump in my throat. This is a ballad sung with great feeling, soul and compassion. Wonderful diction,warmth and intonation.This cd should be added to your library.Someone called it a dance number on a previous review.They must not have a good listening ear."
3,"Good, but not great.","I must admit that when I ordered Ms. Monheit's CD, I also ordered Diana Krall's Nat King Cole Trio tribute ""All for You."" When the discs arrived I played the Krall CD first and was blown away....and I'm not a big Krall fan. Next came Jane and, well Jane was kind of plain. Perhaps one of the things that distracted me were her backup musicians. I got into their groove but not hers. I would like to hear her in a trio/quartet grouping and let her obvious talent do the talking. A good first effort and I plan to keep in touch with her artistc growth. She has the potential to really become a great singer."
3,Check out Teri Thornton,"<<She won second place a few years ago at the Thelonious Monk International Vocal Competition. I'd really like to hear a CD by the first place winner! >>In that case, check out the late Teri Thornton, who was the first place winner in that Monk competition. Any of her CDs is better than this nice, but forgettable, effort."
3,pleasing enough,"Jane Monheit has a lovely voice and a lovely face. However, I don't get all the hype and flurry over this youngster. It was Rachelle Ferrell singing jazz awhile back that literally had my heart pounding and emotions flowing. Moving beyond expectation. SHE IS AMAZING but has moved more to R and B, which is fine because she is brilliant no matter what, but sad because she didnt have the push and hype and looks to sell her jazz records. Rachelle has the talent, vision and pioneering guts to sing real jazz, not just copying."
2,An argument for...for...what was the argument?,"This book seems like Professor Kagan's ""warm-up"" for his book ""The Three Cultures"" released this year. Where ""Three Cultures"" is lucid, exciting and more of an ""integral"" read, ""Argument for Mind"" is tedious and seems more like Professor Kagan working out some confusion. He walks us through multiple studies of development going to pains (and causing pain) to describe mind/brain relations only to discard those relations in his conclusions. I generally like Kagan's work but don't recommend this one. My sense is he was really trying to work out some of the thinking that is nicely presented in ""The Three Cultures"" so I'd go straight to that one if I were a reader looking for a good book."
5,Hard to Find 45s on CD Vol. 5,"No question about the superiority of this series. True nostalgia, and some of the songs in this compilation have not been heard in years."
4,I bought it for one song,"Bill Cosby's ""Little Ole Man."" My mother had a 45 of this song. This is the only place you can get it on CD."
5,Fits all different sizes,This splatter screen is easy to store and great for pans of different sizes! The handle folds up so you can slip it on the side of a cabinet!
3,"Beware, the handle will double back on you","You have to be careful when you lift it off the pan that you keep it horizontal because if you raise it to a vertical position, it will double back and you will risk getting hot grease, or hot water/steam on you.As far as the amount of splatter control, I don't find that it is a lot better than normal splatter screens. I have to lay a paper towel over the top while frying as there still is too much splatter.I find that the fitting on top of pans is about somewhat better than a regular splatter screen, but not as good as I was expecting.I bought a new dishwasher that the racks are adjustable, but it still will only fit in one place in my dishwasher or it will flop around.DeeVirginia"
4,Best Ever,"I've purchased this item about 3 months ago, and I love it. When I first got it in I was a bit suprised and upset. Because the screen was metal and not mesh. But the first time I used this and had to clean it. I realized that the metal was much better then the mesh. Its so much easier to clean then mesh. You don't have to worry about little pieces of things getting stuck in the holes and you pick at the mesh to get it out. An then the mesh is messed up because you picked at it and then the mesh becomes misshaped. All in all this is a really good product. I like it so much, I buying a few for Christmas presents for family."
3,Works--but a little unwieldy,"I generally like OXO products a lot, so I wanted to try this spatter screen in stead of getting one of the wire-mesh models.After having it for a few weeks, I can't say that I'm overwhelmingly happy with this, but I'll live with it.It does reduce/eliminate spatter, but it's kind of unwieldy. It's very large, which makes it most suitable for only large frying pans. It's got a folding handle that kind of clamps (a light press-fit) over the handle of the pan, but then it's just more difficult to lift the spatter guard to check on what's underneath.It cleans up nicely--maybe a little easier than the wire mesh types. As with most OXO products, it's well made with high quality materials. I'll keep it, but am on the lookout for something smaller (or adjustable) that might fit my needs better."
5,excellent spatter protection,"I like this version. It stops more of the spatter than the screens in my experience, and it is easier to clean. It looks much more durable - the screen things I've had have all died quickly. You can't see the food through it, but I like the fact that it retains more of the heat, so pork chops (for instance) get cooked through while they are being browned. For some reason our local Target was selling these for $5 for a while, so I bought a lot of them and tossed out what we had been using."
2,Hard to clearn,Great idea to keep the splatter down however it burns or gets black/brown on the surface that doesnt come off when you clean the item.
3,Its feature is what ruins it,I am a big fan of OXO products as I trust their design and they do make quality products though with that said this Splatter Screen isn't their best product. The design of having a folding handle is great as it can easily go in the dishwasher as well as be put away easily for good storage. It does do a good job of keeping the grease in the pan and does fit on a variety of pan sizes though the part that really is a shame is that the feature of it having a folding handle is also what makes it bad as it will double back and fold as you try to say get some of the fat/grease out of the pan while holding the Splatter Screen in place and will cause grease/fat to get all over the place.This is a good Splatter Screen though I feel that there are better ones out there. If OXO added a locking feature on the Handle then this would get a 4 star maybe a 5 though until they (if) update then I would recommend getting another Splatter Screen.
5,Great design and works too.,"For the extra price this is by far the best splatter guard out there. I looked everywhere first , then i bought this. Love the folding handle for easy storage. The screen is extra thick , nothing gets through this but air. You can also rest your untensils on the top while you cook. Good investment unless you like to clean up grease splatter."
5,The Best I've Found!,"After reading the reviews here, I had to see the Oxo splatter screen for myself. I found one and bought it immediately. This thing is top quality in both appearance and functionality. The folding handle is well designed and extremely well built. If you need a splatter screen, this is the one you should buy, IMHO!"
3,"Great bag, bad straps.","So lets start with the good. This is a great surplus bag. Well made, great condition. Exactly what i was expecting.Now on to the bad. The straps that my bag came with sucked. Maybe i just had a bad set but the first time I put this pack on with some weight in it the buckle that holds the straps together popped. The buckle was worn and perhaps a tad to small, or something but for the life of me i could not get it to hold. So i had to jerry rig it with duct tape (Took it camping right after i got it, guess i should have tested it first). So in the end i just replaced them with nice aftermarket straps.The bag still holds up and is looking great, infact im taking it on another camping trip this weekend. I suggest getting this bag, despite my strap issue."
2,Just So so,"This DVD is just OK, you get some tidbits of songs but nothing substantial(in fact after watching it I sold it immediately on ebay). If you're a Neil Young freak and need to have it then order it, if not there are others on the market that are a lot better."
1,Was at his Worst,"Young wrote the songs presented here and countless other gems that could have been used. Those were the lucky ones, for they were not predictably butchered by the assembled cast. Josh Grobin, please (just go away that is). The always coma inducing Nora Jones, Jackson Browne, Shawn Colvin and Sheryl Crow. The progressively more annoying Elvis. The shockingly bad James Taylor and John Mellencamp.Fogerty and Urban stood out and started off the event solidly. Sadly it was all down hill from there.Don Was was listed as the musical director, so he must be to blame for this mess. Young certainly deserved much better than this for a tribute, at least we were spared another appearance by the more and more ubiquitous India Aire and Esperanza Spaulding at these ""events"".Putrid performances. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,Used Book not like new as claimed.,"This book is used. The seller wrote ""Like New"" while the book is not extremely damaged, it is not like new. There are brown stains on the book so it should have been listed as used. Not ""Like New"".Thank you."
3,A bunch of (good) excerpts,"These arent short stories, they are excerpts from full books about Everest and K2.If I had known that I would have skipped it. When i read non-fiction about everest I want to read something from start to finish and get invested in the people whose story it is.Reading about loss and survival on everest isnt nearly as meaningful when you know so little about the people. Great stories deserve full telling."
4,A Home Medical Library Staple,"Ever wonder about the origin of some home remedies? Perhaps those of your family or maybe of anothers? Ever wonder if they really work? Dr Jones explains in plain language the origin and the use of many readily avaliable minerials and herbs as home remedies as well as alternatives to doctor prescribed medications. In the time I have owned the book, I have found it to be a regular referral source for ""what ails ya"". Besides being informative, I found it to be fast and easy reading."
2,"Good Practice Test, no information.","I expected some information about what information would be tested in this guide. Sadly, none was provided, other than the usual testing drivel. The only redeeming quality of this pamphlet is the practice test and answer information. Worth the money just for that."
2,Wood cracked on OXO Good Grips Wooden Reamer,"I like the feel of this in my hand, but after the first washing, the wood cracked in several places. There were no washing instructions included so perhaps I used water that was too warm/hot. I didn't use soap, but I rinsed it before using it. Then I used it to get the juice out of about 40 key limes. I don't know if it was the acid of the key lime juice or the water temperature. I wish it had care instructions so I would know what I did wrong, if anything."
5,A MUST READ,THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ FOR ALL MARIO AND PENGUIN FANS. THE MANY PHOTOS REALLY MAKE THIS A STAND OUT BOOK. WE FOLLOW MARIO FROM HIS CHILDHOOD TO BEING THE CEO OF THE TEAM HE PLAYED HIS ENTIRE CAREER FOR. IT CONTAINS EACH GOAL MARIO SCORED IN HIS CAREER ALONG WITH WHO ASSISTED AND WHAT GOALIE GAVE IT UP. WE REALLY DON'T GET A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF MARIO'S LIFE BUT WE GET THE NITTY GRITTY. ONE OF THE OTHER HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS BOOK IS ABOUT HIS BACK INJURY AND THE REHAB HE HAD TO GO THRU TO PLAY AGAIN. MARIO ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH A LIFE THREATENING DISEASE AND THE AFTER AFFECTS OF RADIATION. ALL IN ALL THIS REALLY IS AN EXCELLENT SALUTE TO THE MAGNIFICENT ONE. VERY RECOMMENDED.
3,Book review,"As much as I really like the Mario story, I found it very difficult if not impossible to read on certain pages due to a very small font and dark print on black background. I am older so my vision is not as good as my sons, but he had a hard time reading too!"
1,It started Fine,"I have only used this stopper, maybe 3 times. And it has already stopped working. It will no longer close, it pours well though. And after less than 5 uses, I did not get my money worth. I will not recommend this tool to anyone."
4,Stop W(h)ining!,"When the cork resists going back into the bottle, this stopper is an easy, ready alternative."
5,Works as Promised,"Great price and doesn't allow the wine to leak, even when the bottle's on its side.A perfect, simple product!From my experience, OXO products are generally pretty cheap and work well."
3,Good take on the Chinese in SF during the 1970's,I found this book to be really illuminating. Talks about the Chinese in San Francisco during the 1970's. If you want a first person account of what it's like to be an ABC (American Born Chinese) during that time then this is definitely one of the books - well ok Bill wasn't technically an ABC but he's close enough.
3,Hmmm....,"At first glance this tell all is a gritty, dark and acurate portrayal of asian-american strife in our unforgiving communities. However, the constant editing mistakes becomes a bit distracting. That coupled with a lack of consistancy ultimately spelled doom for ""Chinese Playground"". Still an entertaining read...being that I also am from a large chinese enclave. Coulda been a contenda!"
1,"Bad ""Stand by Me"" clone","I watched in hope that this movie would redeem itself at some point, but it never happened. This film is a good example of what happens when an inexperienced writer/director trys to recreate his favorite film. The acting is flat, the characters poorly developed, the story fractured and not believable - but the mountain scenery is nice. In short, watch the real thing instead of this ""wanna-be."""
2,Not Worth it (for the ps2),"When I first picked up this game I thought wow this sounds cool. 250,000 acres, stunt n cars, and other grand theft auto like game play. But once I stuck into my ps2 I noticed I made a HUGE mistake. The Vehicle Control is terrible, Game play is choppy, plus the story is nothing to write home about. I have not played the X-box or X-box 360 versions so it could be just the ps2 version that is bad. Overal the game is not worth the 40 or so dollars."
5,Fun open world game,"Just Cause is no Grand Theft Auto,but it is still very good.There are alot of cool missions that you can play through.The landscape in this game is huge,so it makes it really fun to explore the map.The graphics aren't breath taking,but the thrill you get while playing the game makes up for it.Overall,if you're looking for a cool open world game other than a GTA title for your PS2,then I would highly recommend Just Cause."
5,Great book-apply Javascript in your web pages in a few days,"This book should get anyone who understands the C programming language and HTML up and running in a few days. Do things like use Javascript to check for certain conditions, the web browser information, password protection, shopping cart and such. The book is an introduction so you don't see server side scripting, however, most pro webpages use a whole lot more technologies like DHTML,XML and there is a need for other supplementary material. Yes there is a need for a JavaScript language reference like Pure JavaScript. Anyway, I think I like it because it is well written."
5,Video Catnip,"Ordered 3 videos for cats at the same time. We live in an area where wildlife abounds & the cats just have to look out the window to see it. Just thought they might like to watch something on TV. The creatures on the 65 inch screen got their attention. They were frightened by the giants at first, now they come into the room to watch when they hear the video come on. The loop feature let's the video run continuously, nice when you are away."
1,Unfortunately Dissapointing,"I bought this for a 4 year old (who loves numbers) and an 8 year old (excellent reader). Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. The controls either didn't work or were impossible to figure out. The voice over sounded like a 3rd generation video tape. It was really unfortunate, as my kids like playing the Rayman games.We like the Jump Start and ClueFinders games, and will probably stick with them after this."
3,"Good, but expected something different","This story was good. But I expected something more on Gnosis and Samael Aun Weor. I expected a documentary type video, with interviews, facts etc. Instead it was slide show with talking.This would have been better as an audio book or powerpoint. Message was good, but content weak."
5,a great compliment to the first two greatest hits,"This is a great album. The remakes of older songs and the new songs and the guest artists make for a great listen. Track 3 ""Barcelona"" is, in my opinon, the best song on the album, it features Mercury singing along with a great opera singer. ""Too Much Love Will Kill You"" and ""Las Palabras de Amor""(the words of love) were my other favorites. Since rap isn't really my thing I didn't like Wyclef Jean's remix of ""Another One Bites the Dust"", but the other tracks more than make up for it. The album is rounded out by the original recording of ""Those Were the Days of Our Lives"" and finally ""Thank God it's Christmas"".The recordings were great, they are all studio recordings and not live(at least I can't hear any background crowd chatter in any of them). I say, a must own for any one who calls themselves a Queen fan."
5,Fast and fascinating read,"I ripped through this book, could not put it down! I look forward to the next installment. Wish I had been n the beach. Anyway, good mystery!"
3,an ineresting way to learn a bit of background history,Our group made a visit to the King Tut exhibit at the Museum of natural History in Chicago and several thought that this was a good way to get the feel of the times.
5,Christmas Album,"Ahhh, yes!! I really love this Christmas album. The songs are simply great but of course, I have always loved the ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" song especially when Barry does the duet with Debra Byrd. The first time I ever saw them do the duet for this song was from the A&E:""Live by Request"" tv special and I remember how cute & funny they both were when singing this song. The cover picture for this album looks very romantic, christmasy, & the fireplace in the background makes me wanna cook some marshmallows & sip on some hot cocoa!Merry Christmas!"
5,Great Series,"Amazon Prime has paid for itself in ""Lost"". Whenever I have time, I can access the next episode on IPad or computer or through PS3."
4,Price,"I loved this season and cannot wait to buy it. However, I just have to say that I think it is absolutely ridiculous that season 4 has about 12 less episodes than the other seasons due to the writer's stike, but it still costs the same amount. Does anyone else think that is a total rip-off!"
1,Save your money...,"Great video if you are a die-hard fan but if you're not, might as well save your money and watch it on Netflix or something. I realized that after purchasing it and watching it once that I probably won't ever watch it again."
5,One Great Sleeper,"This is one of those albums that sneaks up on you and draws you in and just gets better and better as you listen to it from time to time. Jack's an original with a lot of range, from lyrical vocals to what sounds like rock and roll filtered through a handful of qualudes. Wonderful!"
5,The Great Jack Scott,This collection contains every hit I remember from Jack Scott. Everyone is done well and the tempo variety is very good.
5,Great Scott,"This CD was all I expected it to be. Having been in high school in the late fifties when many of these hits graced the am radio, I was pleased that the songs were every bit as cool as they were then. Love it."
3,The NEW soundtrack during its release to DVD,"If you are looking for the ORIGINAL soundtrack, you must buy the soundtrack with the picture of just the devil/red bull creature's face staring on the cover. He is not holding a clear ball with Lilly and Jack's face in it. The old soundtrack came out and the old music is heard on the old vhs tape of the film. Remember, if it doesn't say ""Tangerine Dream"" next to some of the songs, you're buying the wrong cd. Songs on the old soundtrack cd are: ""Is You Love Strong Enough"" and ""Love By The Sun"". When the movie came to dvd, new songs were written for the film, so you will have two versions of the soundtrack on cd: old vhs release of movie---and finally: dvd new music by other artists (Jerry Goldsmith)."
5,Fantastic!,"For those of you who want the replacement music done by Tangerine Dream, look elsewhere because this isn't it. Seems that all the other negative reviews base it on the idiotic fact that these people seem to think that the very dated '80s sounding Tangerine Dream score is the ""original"" and they are bummed because ""they"" bought ORIGINAL score by Goldsmith. Confused? Well it confuses me how and why anyone buys a product such as this and they obviously didn't know what they were getting so when they get the wrong one they put a negative review. Here's a tip for people who aren't sure as to the exact soundtrack they are buying...you see the ENLARGE PHOTO link? Well if you enlarge the picture and you see Music Composed and Conducted by so and so and it's not the person you know composed it...then my guess would be it's not the same soundtrack. Also check the product details too, it just may help you out even more."
1,Horrible - Nothing like the ORIGINAL music,WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK USED IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIE (not the REMASTERED)BY TANGERINE DREAM!THis is awful!
1,Looks Good But Not So Great!,"I bought two of these based on price and looks. Minimal assembly, nice to look at but bad for sitting on. The bolts holding the chair to the base poke through the platform and you can feel them while you sit. They even make indentations in the leather seat. I ended up needing to put a pillow on the seat to tolerate it. My twelve year old uses the other chair and the same is happening for him."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"As an industry professional I purchased this book to polish my illustration skills but the book was a huge disappointment. 90% of it is black and white, the other 10% barely contains any rendering instructions. The book is poorly organized - the information is scattered and confusing. For example, the same spread can contain human anatomy samples, clothes details, and Photoshop tips. The same drawings are recycled over and over again throughout the book. The illustrations look over-worked, comics-like, and dated."
3,Slow until the end.............,"It was very slow until the end. I found myself dozing off once and while until later on in the series. Smart marketing tactic to advance 5 years down the road though....now I just have to get season 5..but that was the point, wasn't it? To keep us all in suspense?!"
5,Who doesn't love Desperate Housewives,I tried to watch all season but missed a few so bought the season. It was half the price of my local store.
3,A Great Small Press Mystery,"I've read some of Mr. Vandersteen's short stories online that feature his detective Noah Milano, the security specialist who decided the Family business wasn't for him and became estranged from his gangster father. White Knight Syndrome is a delightful read, especially with it's main character a streetwise but compassionate man who feels compelled to do the right thing."
1,A difficult read if you just want the meat,"Maybe this book contains some good advice. But I gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it. I seriously doubt I'll make it all the way through the book.The first part of the book talks about Michael Gerber's (fictitious?) mentee Sarah, a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and can't get up. The conversations between Michael and Sarah are so contrived and syrupy, who can believe them? Sarah needs to climb a mountain in Nepal, discover the meaning of life, and get it over with.The second part, which I'm reading now, is structured around the 7 ""disciplines"" for building a company. I skipped ahead to this part, but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that I really feel lost not having read it.If you like business story books of the Patrick Lencioni variety, you MIGHT get something out of E Myth Mastery. But be warned: This book as many times longer than Lencioni's, with a lot less meat."
3,"good, not great","This book helps entrepreneurs create systems that allow their company to run, so that they can free-up their time to build and grow the company. As a computer geek who had to operate within highly ineffectual business process, I was highly skeptical that this book could teach me anything. I was pleasantly surprised... its a bit big, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are actually running a business -- or a part of a business -- but it certainly opened my eyes to the value of a culture of entrepreneurialism. It does suffer from a fairly tedious writing style, and perhaps others in the E-Myth series would be a better fit... but it opened my eyes a bit so I'll give it a solid 3 stars."
2,Wordy and Foggy,"Michael Gerber has a lot to say, some of it is wise and great advice, but all of that really could have been put into 30 pages, rather than 400. He continues a long droning conversation with a lady named Sarah all through out the book, by a quarter of the way through I was just skipping desperatly ahead looking for something relevant. This book has some good points, but it is wordy and unfocused. The E-Myth is something every business person should read and understand but beyond that I begin to wonder if there is alot of wisdom left to share."
2,Lots of fluff,"Michael Gerber is a well known buisness speaker and consultant with a long list of speaking titles and books behind his name. This book however, doesn't live up to the hype.The first 75 pages of the book are a gruelling read. It's not the kind of book that draws you back again, but instead is one that you hae to force yourself to go back to because you've paid the money for the book and you want to get some kind of return on your investment. It does get a bit better after this but it is definetly no gem. It seems like Mr. Gerber took the opportunity to add a lot of superfluous fluff around some concrete ideas and exercises in order to make a bigger book. It is one of those books that you wish you could shift through all the junk to reveal the nuggets of useful information.This book may work for those with unending patience but there are more useful ways to spend your time."
3,More text book than last one,Lots of good content - read like a text book from undergrad. Not as easy to follow as the E Myth and did not leave me with clear take aways.
1,I've never wanted to punch an author before...,"If you buy this book to witness a truly amateurish bash at prose, you'll not be disappointed. I nearly cried. Not because I found it moving or convincing, but because I'd just wasted precious time and money.If you want to learn about business, you'll need to wade through a mountain of unusable, irritating, self-indulgent, sentimental waffle and self-congratulatory passages plugging his other products/services.Gerber doesn't care about your time. He has feelings, dammit, and he's going to express them. Aaaarrrgh!I PROMISE I will NEVER buy another book/product related to this guy EVER again."
4,Christopher A.Daniels'games,I wish it had a walkthrough because i'm kind of stuck on where she is blocking the door from the bad guys from coming in by keep pressing x all the time.And the more i keep pressing x my fingers hures.
2,more songs needed,For any DDR fan this game is a dissapointment. Any Trick player can probably beat this game on crazy. This game would have been better if more songs were added and harder steps.
3,This book seems to be suited to children's crafts.,"I was hoping to find more adult crafts, more elaborate. This book is great for 10-15 year olds. My teenage girls enjoyed doing the crafts in this book. I will look for a more ""Adult"" craft book."
5,More than 150 superbly presented recipes,"Compiled and organized by professional pastry chef Regan Daley, In The Sweet Kitchen: The Definitive Baker's Companion showcases more than 150 superbly presented recipes. Enhanced with sixteen pages of four color photographs, as well as chapters dedicated to ""Tools and Techniques"" of baking, the ingredients associated with baking, and an informative section on dedicated to flavourings, In The Sweet Kitchen offers savory fare ranging from cakes and tea cakes, pies and tarts, cookies and bars, custards, puddings and Moussses, to ice creams and other frozen desserts, fruit desserts, quick breads, sweet yeast breads and fritters, garnishes, sauces, and basic recipes adaptable for any occasion. In The Sweet Kitchen is a cornerstone addition to any ""kitchen cook friendly"" cookbook collection!"
5,Great idipendent living aid!,"I've only got use of one hand, that makes standard can opening impossible. This product is very easy to use I love it!"
2,"Beautiful graphics, boring game","Style over substance. Lots of pretty eye-candy, very dull gameplay. I was really looking forward to this game but what a disappointment it is. You fly around (cockpit view) blasting enemy ships with some very cool weapons, but within 10 minutes you'll want to play something else."
1,old fashioned sour apple candy sticks,candy was horrible. nothing about tasted like apple. it was lime and it was horrible!
1,"1/2 star- How can you release Aquemini, and then this isht?","3 solid albums, and then this? I don't get it. Broke my heart mang. They were one of the only ones left that were somewhat mainstream and deserved respect. First Cube, then Tribe, and now Outkast. Sad day for hip hop... great day for mtv...There are only about 2-3 tracks worth listening to. Everything else has weak beats, weak choruses, and/or weak appearances."
5,Stankoriffic,"Wow! I will be listening to this for a long time. This album doesn't fit into any category. It is so far ahead of its time, I hope everyone can appreciate its greatness. Andre & Big Boi not only represent the soul of southern hip-hop, but are part of the new revolution of music. The fad right now is the 'rock-rap fusion' of artists like limp bizkit and kid rock. By listening to 'Gasoline Dreams' and 'Humble Mumble' you can see Otkast has already perfected that style and has moved further. It is a thrill to hear Andre struggle to sing in the chorus of 'Ms. Jackson'. My favorite moment comes in 'So Fresh So Clean'. Andre raps 'Teddy Pendergrass cooler than Freddy Jackson sippin' a milkshake in a snowstorm'. The way he does it is amazing. There are so many great moments in this album, you might as well never take Stankonia out of your CD player."
2,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"... Other than So Fresh & So Clean, BOB, and Ms. Jackson - there is maybe ONE song that is good. There is some stupid... 45 second clip in between each song so you are stuck either listening to these clips or constantly forwarding your CD player. Overall it is not a great album. There are some good songs on there but the whole thing does not flow from one track on to the next. Seems like they threw 10 unecessary tracks on there. Not worth the money ... you can hear it all on the radio for free."
4,Stankonia- the development of Outkast,"I think some of the reviewers have been a bit harsh on outkast for this album. It is certainly different, but as rap music has developed and changed so to have outkast, in order to continue to compete in the game. There are a lot of skits in the album, but they are more than bearable for the quality of the rest of the tracks. My personal favourites are gasoline dreams, humble mumble, we love deez hoez and gangsta sh*t. It also has to be said that ms. jackson is one of outkasts finest ever songs, and probably the one that less knowledgeable outkast fans will remember. So to sum up ill say that this album is different, but if you study it carefully, you'll find all the classic outkast ingredients, and you may uncover some wonderful new experiences from the boys from atlanta"
1,KILL ME before I hear this Album again!!!!!,This is a waste of resources and time. This is degrading and filthy. It should be banned.I hate this album.
4,Not a big rap fan but....,"Outkast has what's missing from hip-hop (and most every other genre out today) originality. They take risks and blend styles and for the vast majority of the album it comes out great. While most rappers are stuck in the cars, money and women rut Outkast's originality stands as a bright lighthouse for the rest of the genre. I could have done without the interludes, but other than that, it is the most diverse album and the most fun album of the year."
5,Stanklove,"This album is an instant classic! Nomatter what kind of music you like buy this album. Every song has a different beat. Definitley Outkast's best work t date.My favorite song on the album is I'll call before I come. But I shouldn't say that because all the songs are great. Trust me, BUY THIS ALBUM!"
3,disapointedfan,"I thought this CD was a let down compred to their previous work. I could put their last CD ""Aquemini"" on when I was driving in my car and it woudn't come out of my CD player for a couple of days. So when ""Stankonia"" came out and I heard a couple of their songs on the radio, so I went out and bought it. I put this CD in and its out in about fifteen minutes. Okay, Miss Jackson is a great song, but when you hear it every time you tearn on the radio it gets old real fast. I blame the radio for the down fall of this CD. Another point, there's only about three good songs on the whole disk. On the previous one there's about ten, and on the CD before that about eight. I think they let the public down on this one. They tried to hard on there music and not enough on there lyrics. With the exception of Miss Jackson, they are rapping about nothing!"
4,The dirty south has risen,"The first time I heard Outkast was 6 years ago on an underground radio show... the song was Aint No Thang and I was amazed. Since then Ive kind of debated getting one of their albums, but never did because rap wasnt really my thing.Recently I have rediscovered rap & hip hop, and this was one of my first purchases. So far I am very pleased. Frankly, I could do without the ""sketches"" or whatever you want to call them between songs. But there are some killer tracks on this one. Ive been listening to Ms Jackson and B.O.B. for the past several days. Xplosion and We Luv Dez Hoez are equally cool.In fact, most of this disc is worth checking out if nothing else. There are a few songs that I tend to skip over, but for the most part, Stankonia is an excellent investment. Take it from someone who, as recently as 3 weeks ago, couldnt stand most rap. Good Stuff."
3,Pretty Good,"Hip-hop and rap not being my cup of tea, I nevertheless dare say that ""Stankonia"" is an immensely creative, pulsating work of art. Annoying interludes and some missteps (""Snappin' and Trappin'"") aside, ""Stankonia"" summarises OutKast's attitude and stands out among the Dre/Big Boi's finest offerings yet. Their view of ghetto life is challenging, reflected in delicious cuts like ""So Fresh So Clean"", relationship-end ode ""Ms. Jackson"", drum&bass bomb ""B.O.B"", clever Erykah Badu collaboration ""Humble Mumble"", driving ""Gangsta S**t"" and bouncy ""Xplosion"". Among the cream of the hip-hop crop, OutKast sport striking intelligence and unique, experimental but yet, easy-to-embrace style."
4,"""Symphony for the North"" originally ""British Columbia Suite""","Not so much a symphony for the north as it is a symphony for British Columbia. Originally released on vinyl as ""British Columbia Suite"" (Capilano Records, CAPS701), it may have been commissioned by then-premier of British Columbia, W.A.C. Bennett, in celebration of Canada's centennial in 1967 (little help here?) Riddle, in his own inimitable style, captures well the spirit of a growing and modern B.C. with compositions such as, ""The Route of the Haidas"", ""The Okanagan"", ""Garibaldi Mountain"" and my personal favourite, ""Vancouver Nights""."
5,"Anita Howe, gaited trainer","A wonderful and inciteful book for anyone with a gaited horse. A fundamental ""must read"" and one of the first resources I recommend to all who come to me for help to understand about gait, what it is and how to help their horses acheive natural fluid gait without mechanical aids, bizarre shoeing or hoof angles and severe bitting. Lee has accomplished a huge work here that has become a cornerstone for those of us working with gaited horse owners, to help them understand that their horses have bred-in abilities and a little basic horsemanship goes a long ways. Thank you Lee."
3,Not the easiest assembly,"I like this, but the assembly was a total pain. It's also not the easiest to put up and down when you want to go from couch to double bed -- you have to pull it out from the wall, and it really takes two people if you don't want to struggle with it. For the price, it's worth the hassle for me, but if you live alone and intend to put this up and down regularly, you might find it's worth it to pay a little more."
2,"Great platform, easy to build, holes drilled in the wrong spots","The platform is really high (just like I wanted). It was pretty easy to put together. It's very sturdy. The only problems I had (and they were enough to drop my rating to 2 stars) are that the drill holes for the dowels are not in the right place, nor do the slats used to turn it into a sofa. It wont be usable as a sofa, only a bed frame. Bed engineering."
3,Honing Made Easy,"The wheel works fine. I did notice that the rubber washer that is adhesivly attached was off center a little and had to be trimmed to fit.Also the leather was a bit ruff for a honing tool. I think it should wear in OK. Since it is a leather product, they all will vary somewhat...Enjoy..."
4,scraper just as described,"the tool was in great condition, new and as per the description. the item is a fine product as advertized"
4,On Reflection: Good,"A wide range of stories of life in the slow lane of post industrial Scotland. I picked up this book in a store, tried to read it and pretty much immediately put it down for six months. I was put off by the written Scots dialect (in some (not all) of the stories), the seeming inconsequentality of some of the storylines, and the surreal nature of some others.I'm glad I picked it up again. I tried reading ""Nice to be Nice"" (written in Scots) oot loud to mysel' an' it made a lot more sense, and became an affecting story of a man working (in a small way) against bureaucracy. Reading other stories it became clear that they ARE about everyday life, but they add a poetic quality to it, and really get you inside the head of the characters.I would recommend this book."
4,The Deliah Complex,Really enjoyed this book and the other ones of her that i have read. Would like to read more of the same.
3,the delilah complex,Wasn't sure about this when i got it. But it was okay. A quick read for those of you who want.
3,One time read.,"I bought this one, based on the customer reviews, and amazon had sent me an email about Kindle deals ;-). The story is quite intriguing, and keeps you guessing till almost the end. However, since the main character is a sex therapist, you will be inundated with talk about feelings, emotions etc. For someone who reads tons of emotionless spy novels, it can get a bit heavy at times.For an erotic thriller, it does not focus much on the mind,deviations or actions of the actual killer. There are obvious diversions, with the real culprit just popping up at the end. Quite good for a quick read, thats about it. You can read the other reviews for a synopsis."
2,Let down...,"I read the sypnosis on this book, it sounded thrilling. The story starts out with a bang and the story is very interesting. But- at the end it just flops. The criminal gets caught ""the end."" We're left with nothing as to what happens the rest of the women and the women's club, nothing mentioned as to why the ""criminal"" came to be disturbed. The story felt unfished. What a crock!"
5,Another five stars for MJ,"I read Lip Service and knew I'd found a fabulous author with a voice I could lose myself in. I counted the months until DELILAH. From the opening scene, you're hooked. Great, multi-layered, complex characters. And the plot is just so spicy, as it all builds and comes together, it's like savoring an eight course meal.Fabulous twist ending that, at least this reader, didn't see coming. MJ now ranks as one of my favorites.If you get hooked on her like I did, Lip Service and Flesh Tones will not dissappoint!"
2,too many uninteresting details,I read at least 2 books per moth and listen to at least 2. There were many what I consider boring~not needed details in this book and I dont feel the plot was developed enough. I skimmed a lot of the book bc it was not interesting.
4,The Moonflower Vine,"This book seems to have been forgotten over the years. I've never heard of it, but enjoyed it immensely. It's particularly of interest to sisters. It's told from differing points of views of all the family members. In the end there's a bit of a mystery solved, also, but it is mainly about family relationships. The descriptions really bring into focus the sights and smells of the time period."
5,Don't Miss This Classic!,"Don't miss this excellent book. It is a beautiful honest story. It is ashamed that Jetta Carleton only wrote one book as I am sure that others would have been treasures as this one certainly is. The lives of each character are shown in relationship to each other, as well as individual stories. It is so natural that one believes these ficticious Missouri characters are real. That is the key to Carleton's writing, it is so natural and true to what might happen in reality in a family. Comparison to these characters and their time, is a demonstration of how far we have come financially and technologically. However, the love and loyalty of these Soame family members perhaps is something we have lost in this age of technology. To wait for the moonflowers to bloom and to notice the beauty of a farm, is a main theme of this beautiful story. I have had moonflowers along my patio and understand the excitement of seeing the moonflowers bloom after sunset."
4,Took me to a different time and place,This story of one family told from the different perspectives of each family member is a beautifully piece of American literature. The drives and desires of each person are so different from what everyone else perceives them to be. A great short read.
3,A wonderful story of a country family,This was a wonderful book about people no different then ourselves. The lived in a different time but the loved and lost the same as us.The characters were so well written it wasn't hard to feel their joy or sadness.Definitely a story to read.
2,Garden Party,"Although the songs are done well, ""Stranger on the Shore"" is not the song that was the number one song of the year in 1963. It reminds me of Rick[y] Nelson's performance at Madison Square Garden; it was not the same! Stranger on the Shore has been made ""new and improved [?]"" and does not have the Leon Young Corale nor the distictive ending. Ending,what ending! This is not the song that was my closing theme song as a disc jockey."
2,"Good, but doesn't seem to be his ""old"" style.","I thought this was not his old style like on the original vinyl. The selections on ""Some of the Best"" are much more like it. Even ""Stranger on the Shore"" sounds different."
3,"Not bad, if only had Megablast...","I don't know why this CD doesn't have Megablast: Hip Hop on Precinct 13 - perhaps there's copyright issues involved. Either way it deals a mortal wound to this compilation which rates very much as ""some of the best"". The previous reviewer here notes how difficult it is to find Unknown Territory as opposed to Into the Dragon. I've been on an eight year crusade to find a copy of Into the Dragon, only recently completed (phew!) because Sony have re-released it (hooray!), which should mean that Amazon should be selling it soon. It could mean they re-release Unknown Territory as well. For some reason Bomb the Bass albums have been deleted from production rather shortly after their initial release - Into the Dragon was long gone in 1992, but it looks like the long wait is just about over...So in short - wait for Amazon to start selling Into the Dragon, and join in the prayers for the re-release of Unknown Territory - both of those easily eclipse the material here."
3,replacement spool,"The item that came isn't the same packaging as the picture. I got it for a spare and haven't actually installed it but it seems that it will fit. I hope so, the model numbers on the one I rec'd don't include my trimmer model but the pictured item did."
1,Great resource-Bad read,"Great resource but extremely difficult to read and not recommended for the layman. Full of research data and references. Great material for a clinician but reads like a doctoral thesis, not a book."
5,;),"Don't buy this set if you like Legend, because you will cringe when hearing it after this set. It is just extraordinary."
5,Timeless classic,"Anyone who has listen to Bob Marley knows his works will forever live on. I do prefer disc 2,3,4 the best, but the entire CD set is worth the price."
5,One of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read,"This book is unafraid to ask why none of the dire AIDS predictions we all remember from the '80s has come true. Read it and decide for yourself. Duesberg is the rare, world-class scientist who will put his name and funding on the line by taking a heretical view on a political hot-button subject. Inventing the AIDS Virus is an important expose of how research funded by government agencies and drug companies destroys initiative and invention. Many of us gay men have been asking ourselves for years why the conventional wisdom on AIDS seems so at odds with our personal experience. This book explains why. If a loved one has been diagnosed positive for HIV antibodies, you must read this book."
1,Mr. Duesberg - How confident are you?,"Seems to me that Mr. Duesberg could prove his own hypothesis by having himself injected with the Aids virus repeatedly and see what happens. Is he willing to do this? If not, then I see nor reason to give this book any stars.Kary Mullis - are you willing also?"
1,"Ignoring the data, and the truth","When Duesberg first began to talk about AIDS he was correct in saying that Koch's postulates had not been fulfilled. Some 20 years later both Koch's postulates and Bradford Hill's criteria for causation have been fulfilled, meaning it has been proven that HIV causes AIDS, according to established medical principles.What's astonishing about Duesberg is that he continues to pretend that this data, and data from hundreds of related articles, simply does not exist. That's what we see in his talks and his writing: if you just ignore the published research, and selectively focus on the smaller, unresolved details, you can convince any gullible or predisposed person that established fact is false."
5,the best movie ever made,"you would be stupid not to pay what they are asking, this is the best movie ever!"
5,A must have!!!!!!!!!!,"I got to say this has been a favorite of mine for almost 20 years. I am glad to see it put on dvd. Nothing against modern humor but nothing beats the 80's. It is funny from start to finsh. Paul Rodriguez has some of the best one liners ever. If anyone is thinking of buying this movie I say go for it, its funny, an instant classic, and it doesnt have the pointless plot like movies now do."
1,Bravemole,"My second grade son was read this book in school to commemorate the attacks on the WTC. *For children under 10yrs, Bravemole is too graphic and should be avoided.*Although this book tries to appeal to younger children with its very charming pictures the content is disturbing. The events of Sept. 11th are portrayed by cute and cuddly characters, but the real message that comes forward is that all good ""bravemoles"" should put their faith in ""Overmole"" and march off to war.For older children that can scrutinize these issues Bravemole is a great way to ease into a difficult topic. This book should be targeted to older children who can discuss and comprehend the issues."
2,not to great,"Terrible sratagy guid for multiplayer ! (almost a sure loss!) not worth the cash! The only thing I liked were the maps, although they could have been in color! The guid for the acual game is moderatly written.Overall not worth the money"
5,Awesome Music!,"Great range of styles, but cohesive at the same time. Emotional intesity is high, but with great ideas and an authentic, earthy feel. Highly recommended!"
4,Adventure and heros of a forgotten age,"Set at the time of Romans in England when Hadrian's wallwas a going thing, Bran Mak Morn is about a black PictKing who stood against the Romans. In the Arthur taleswe have a southern King who stood for civilization:in Bran Mak Morn we have a King who was of the elder bloodand sought to turn the greedy tide of Roman urbanization.Robert E. Howard calls every kind of ancient legend and fableto aid his plots and poetry. The books is a well written set ofshort stories with only a loose connection starting in the'20'sand going until the '60's. The story telling is masterlysuch that many have imitated him since."
4,"Good quality, all items were there, blue color a little washed out","Bought these to replace a set of 12"" blue cathodes that were too large to fit inside my case, the 12"" I had bought at a box store and discovered after driving two hours from there that they didn't come with a switch to turn them off. These however included the little IO shield with the toggle switch in it which is exactly what I was looking for. Build quality is as good as I would expect for the price the lights are bright and light up my entire system very well. My only complaint is that this particular brand blue light is a bright washed-out blue that I would compare more to a blue sky than the rich blue that I was expecting."
4,Bought for a friend,"I you like techno, you may appreciate this techno cover compilation of the doors, I purchased for a couple friends as a small gift. I was not so impressed with more than one or two songs on the CD."
5,AWESOME,"An amazing series! I really enjoyed this series and wish I could have afforded to purchased all four box sets. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys history and while this King Henry does not get fat, Jonathan does an amazing job at being King!!"
3,Saddlebred history,Two volume set (also available individually). Written by the founder and editor of The Kentucky Horseman.
5,Great blast from the past!,"Ah, the good old days when 'National Lampoon' magazine was funny.Plus, this yearbook was the origin of the Lampoon's classic movie ""Animal House"", with the first appearance of Larry 'Lance' Kroeger.Lots of fun!"
3,O.k.,"Arch Rivals is more of a Sports game but anyway, Arch Rivals is a beat em up, dook it out, basketball game where the goal is obviously, score and win the game but as an added bonus, you get to punch out your opponent as he drives to the hoop.Nothing all that special. It's basically Double Dribble except it's 2 on 2 and the computer is good, really GOOD! Sometimes the computer is too good and it makes this simple game very difficult and when you have an easy game and you make it way too hard, people lose interest and that's what happened here for me atleast.I wouldn't bother because this game gets real old real quick. There aren't too many really good Sports games on NES but if you ever find this rare title I would check it out instead of this, TECMO Soccer which took characters from River City Ransom and put them on the soccer field. That one was a much better beat em up sports game. If you can find Tecmo Soccer, check it out!"
5,Napco by Kathleen Deel,"This is by far the best book on Napco figurines and has MANY of the hard to find items fully photographed. I have been looking for a book to help me on my Storybook collectables for years and this one is a dream come true! Also has birthday angels and many, many more! So much information all photographed and in beautiful full color! Kathleen Deel knows her Napco collectables and now I will too! I highly recommend this book!"
5,Absolutely superb!,"Absolutely top-notch! I had the wonderful opportunity to have Mr. Tomaro as my state's All State Jazz Ensemble director in high school and I learned a lot from him, as well.A must have!"
3,question,so does this item come with the black green and orange cable too if not where do i get them what to search
5,What a great device,i'm so glad I found this converter. It does exactly what it said it would on my 5.1 speakers. i am able to now use the speakers I had for my computer on my TV and Playstation. :)
5,Perfect for the Weber Grill.,I love the Camp Chef cast iron griddle. It fits perfectly on my Weber Grill. Just the thing for burgers or cheesesteaks without flare ups.
4,"brilliant, absolutely brilliant","I especially like 'Flying Without Wings', a really beautiful song and their cover of 'More Than Words' Shane really sounds like Ronan, but Mark's unbelievably sweet voice makes the whole album worth listening to (and worth my hard earned bucks!) Promising enough, but the songs get cheesier on the B-side, they lack depth..but the album's still worth it."
1,Save your time,One of the dumbest movies ever made; insulting plot and bad acting to boot. What a waste of time. One star for trying.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed by ""Gone But Not Forgotten"". I bought the DVD based on the glowing recommendations here but found it did not live up to the hype. The plot is weak and extremely predictable. The acting is so-so, good in some scenes while lacking in others. While the film did have it's high points, I'm sorry to say that they were few and far between. I don't recommend this film."
2,Watch It A.Y.O.R.,One star goes to the twist in this boring story and the other goes to those cute boys whose acting kinda puts me off.
3,"Gone , but not forgotten","This is a sweet little independent film. The acting is fair, and has some interesting twists to the story. The film is slow paced, but has heart. The latter half of the film has a wife that would make anyone want to be GAY. Her acting wasn't very good. But the two male leads are attractive and beleivable characters in this not so mainstream romance."
3,"Works well enough, smells ugly","Provides a smooth and comfortable enough shave, but this stuff smells BAD, like Lysol hospital floor disinfectant, and I notice the smell ""sticking"" to my skin well into the morning no matter how well I rinse. I haven't noticed any positive effect from the anti-bacterial properties. Also, someone recommended something like this becuase it doesn't foam so it provides a ""clear"" shave. I can't see how this really offers any advantage - if anything, it just makes it easier to miss a spot because it is harder to tell where you have shaved and haven't shaved. I'll continue to use the rest of this tube, but won't buy it again."
3,Fantastic Facts about the Oregon Trail,"Too general for people who are serious about the Trail, but would be a nice 'stocking stuffer for a children's party exchange gift."
5,BLOOD ON THE DIVIDE,"EXCELLENT READING, FILLED WITH PERIOD HUMOR,SPELLING OR LACK THEIR OF, ADVENTURE AFTER ADVENTURE AND A SENSE OF BEING INVOLVED WITH THE TIME."
3,Worth the Price,"The Adventures of Lolo was a challenging game. Room after room of seemingly easy puzzles await you. Sometimes the puzzles need more work than they seem to, and sometimes less than what it seem. It combines skill and patience, and is worth the price. Enjoy!"
4,Helpful in deciding where to apply,"This book contains information that is very similar to the book published by the AAMC, Medical School Admissions Requirements (MSAR). The most important information contained in this book is the data on in-state and out-of-state acceptance rates. As a result, I knew which out-of-state medical schools were worth applying to (UMich, UCSF) and which ones were not (UC-Irvine). I would recommend getting either this book or the MSAR."
4,A must-have.,A great resource. Well-organized with all necessary information easy to find. A must-have for any aspiring doctor. If only getting into medical school was as easy as using this book.
2,Easily Paino Magic's weakest work to date,"There was a time when it seemed like Glen Johnson could do no wrong. PM's Low Birth Weight, for those who have had the fortune to listen to it, is easily one of the best underground Indie classics of the past 10 years. Although not as powerful, Son De Mar and Artists Rifles are still excellent albums in their own right and retain a consistent mood throughout. The same cannot be said of this album. Now I am a very big fan of this group which is why I was so shocked at how weak this album was compared to PM's previous work. Only a few songs such as ""(Music Won't Save You From Anything But) Silence"" are worth listening to. The monumentally boring ""Season Is Long"" is such a waste of time. What was Glen thinking?!I can't remember the last time that I felt so let down by an album that I was waiting so long for. If you want a good introduction to the songs that make Piano Magic so great, pick up Low Birth Weight instead."
2,Worked for a while then broke,At first I was very excited about this. It worked for about 2 months before it started becoming jenky. A couple weeks ago the fan started turning off randomly. Now the fan is making really bad sounds. On one side it will go have way through vending then make a very sharp rattling sound. The dispense doesn't complete and the cylinder gets stuck. Koolatron I am not happy. If this is not fixed I will be very upset.
1,awesome! at first!!!,"first machine quit working after one week, the replacement quit working after working great for one night. Sorry peeps, save your money for something else, believe me we wanted this to be a good product because it is such a great eyesight, but company that makes needs to build better. thank you, I love Amazon!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Game,"We've enjoyed the regular Sequence game and this one is just a little different but more compact for travel and if you're outdoors, you don't have to worry about the cards blowing away."
4,Like the Music of Angry Fax Machines,"Certainly not ""casual entertainment music"", or even particularly ambient.It takes a certain frame of mind to listen to this album, but that frame of mind becomes increasingly accessible with a few passes at the CD.Fantomas get given credit in the booklet, and that's the most comparable sound I can think of - this is strange, dark, drawling soft moments interspersed with energized outbursts of Saxophone squeals and Guitar riffs.This is electronic beeps, whines, and rhythms that feel like a busy copier room come to climax. And it rocks.This is 3 am music.The Jazz is felt."
5,Thomas Land,Anything to do with Thomas the Tank Engine is a real pleaser and lasts through multiple children.
1,Totally biased...subtly anti-Semitic,"I had to watch this film a second and third time, just to make sure my perceptions were accurate. I found this film to be highly biased in its comparison of the two relgions/cultures, and their rituals, names, dating processes. When the Muslim man is washing his hands in preparation for prayer, this ritual is sensitively depicted. When the Muslim girl and her intended are sitting on the couch meeting her parents for the first time and deciding to go ahead with the match, they are portrayed as high-achieving and beautiful with a promising future ahead. I saw nothing in the film portraying Jewish culture in a sensitive way; quite the opposite. The women (Rochel's mother and the shadchan, and Rochel herself) were portrayed as catty, sniping, loud-mouthed. The list goes on. Jewish environs, rituals, people, attitudes, names all were portrayed as ugly and nebby, while Muslim ones were shown as sensitive, beautiful, and rich with pride in heritage. Watch for yourself."
1,Arranged,"I was annoyed with this film from the very beginning. The two religious adherents are portrayed as virtuous, thoughtful, well spoken and modest and every other woman in the room is a two-bit whore who talks like a valley girl. Why do they always do that? Couldn't watch much past five minutes as I was choking on righteousness."
4,Very Good,"I enjoyed this movie because it was well done, light and entertaining. Not heavy, depressing or sad. I like to see points of view from other cultures for better understanding."
1,Excellent,Is all that I need to work with my class. Has a lot of information in regards how our mind works using the technology.
3,Nothing spectacular,"Nothing wrong with them, but lets face, what can you say about cookie sheets. The nice thing is that they do not have any coating that can come off on the cookies."
2,Poor quality,Cheaply made. Edges are just rolled over and crimped. The steel on these edges is scared and uneven. Poor quality.
2,Im nervous,"After suffering through 2 hours of my life that I will never get back by seeing ""The American,"" I'm nervous to give a Geroge Clooney movie, even one nomianted for an Oscar, a fair chance. Will probably just wait until it comes out on HBO or something.I'll give it two stars because it can't possibly be as awful as The American was. But I havent seen it yet and am nervous about buying, or even renting it."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzz,"Well, the acting was great, but the story was just plain boring. Certainly not a movie that was entertaining, or even that interesting. Glad I had a free pass to the movies for this one. Wait for it to be free on tv. And don't buy it cause you would never want to watch it more than once."
4,"Good movie, worth the $5.00 for rental","Not a Clooney fan, but I liked the film and the role he played. A good film for the whole family. No gratuitous sex or explicit language, but it did have a good story line. Pretty good shots of our 50th state's beauty, also a short history of the monarchy. Overall a pretty good movie. Enjoy!"
2,Sad the Whole Time!,"This movie was sad the whole time. It had a bit of wit here and there but even the points they seemed they were trying to get across were not played off well. My dad fell asleep; I almost did. In the end I would say great acting, boring movie, with no point!"
3,Greed,"Matt King (George Clooney) is a real estate agent who wants to fix his relationship with his two daughters after his wife ends up in a coma.I hear 'Hawaii', and I think of nothing but beautiful scenery. This movie showed me the not so beautiful parts of the Island, which made it more... I guess genuine is the word I want to use. That was a good thing. What was going on with Matt's great, great great grandmother's inheritance was interesting. Family means nothing to some people when money is involved, that's for sure. And, of course, George Clooney's performance was good. But teenagers disrespecting adults - there was too much of that. There was also too much profanity. I don't think the F-bomb is ever necessary, but if it's going to be used in a sentence, it could at least make sense."
3,Clooney is a dude,"Which is why this movie is watchable but unbelievable. No woman in her right mind would cheat on George Clooney. His facial expressions are wonderful. It is a decent, unremarkable movie with a simple flaw at the center.The entire movie I asked myself how anyone could have cheated on George?!"
3,"George at his usual,mediocre","A movie that includes stewardship of the land, marriage infidelity and last but not least parenting of teens.Tried to cover all bases was called out at first."
3,"very, very slow movie","This movie was so slow. Even the scenery was lacking. It speed up at the 1.25 hr mark, but not for long."
2,We've all yawned our way through a dozen movies like this....,"Clooney is much better at being the ""cute clown"" so loved by so many of his loyal female admirers. It's when he veers off course into the arena of serious drama that he seems a little out of his area of competence. In 5 months the movie has made about $83M in the States, and $171M worldwide, so it's been a success, if that sort of thing impresses us, really.... As the ""cute clown"", Clooney is entertaining, but when served up with a side-order of slice-of-life human angst, Clooney is kind of boring to many of us who also have a Y-chromosome.Anytime Clooney wants to make a pile of money, all he has to do is shave, get dressed up, and appear in another ""Ocean's""-style movie. The women will follow him in hordes... at the theater, and on election day, where this well-known liberal Democrat serves as one of Obama's ""high priests"".OK, next!"
2,Just OK,"This is just OK. Glad I didn't pay full price in a movie theater. If you have nothing to do, you can watch this."
2,Dreadful,"Unlike the movie, I'll keep it short. At best this is lifetime channel drivel. Poorly written, all of the characters are dreadful and wholly uninteresting whiners. Who cares if wifey is dying? She was a despicable human being anyway. Two stars only for Clooney's decent acting and shots of my beautiful home away from home, Hawai'i. Save yourself some time and money and skip this trite POS."
2,Hated it,I did not like George Clooney in this role. The movie was boring too. I didn't even finish watching it.
2,"One podcast critic expressed a view that this film is ""a mile wide and an inch deep"".","This is a serious ambitious movie about relationships--husbands and wives, parents and children, peers-- and it deserves credit for the attempt. It also has pathos and wit. Its themes is seemingly unconditional forgiveness and tolerance but that seems at times unreal and sentimental. The extended deathbed scenes also get too close to schmalz at times. There is also the irrelevant Sierra club type of stupid decision NOT to develop a choice piece of real estate."
2,George Clooney fan,I was greatly disappointed in the language content of this movie especially after preparing myself for a good family story.
2,This movie is slow,"Kind of a downer too, but I guess if you're in the mood for a gentle, lazy movie about privileged yet unhappy white hawaiians then this is it."
2,Not a good DVD...,"This is a video was waiting to recieve. It came on a very timely matter, however I was very disapointed while watching the video it kept going in and out with a black screen. I have never had a dvd video that I purchased ever do that. Is it possible that I have a DUDE. Your response will be greatly appreciated. Mahalo, Thella Asing"
4,octobermoon,great story line..great settings (hawaiian islands). the actors in this flic are awesome. i was most interested in this movie because of the story line. if you know how it feels to lose a loved one well you will be touch..and for those who experienced one's decisions as well. not an action nor fiction..but plain realistic in any setting.
2,"Very, very slow........","My husband and I did not like the movie. It was a complete downer with monotone acting and unlikeable characters. The scenery was beautiful and the concept of ""finding the important things in life"" through a family tragedy is commendable, but to us, the film just didn't rise to the level of enjoyable entertainment. We found it to be a chore to make it to the end of the movie. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers who commented about all the high reviews, ""what ARE people thinking?"" Must be easy to please or George Clooney devotees?!"
5,Incredible,"If you like intersted earthy music you should buy this, every track will grow into your soul the more you listen to it"
4,Good gameplay & graphics make good game...,"Hudson did a nice job of building on top of their most popular game, by adding creatures that can be ridden with different special powers. The graphics and gameplay are as vibrant and exhuberrant as before, and this is a great sequel to a great game."
3,Fun game; cult classic,"Okay, if you've been reading my reviews you might be thinking, ""How can Bad Dudes get only 3 stars from this clown?"". Let's break it downthis way: 1 star=Terrible (ie. Jordan vs. Bird), 2 stars=Poor (ie. Castlevania III), 3 stars=Decent (ie. Bad Dudes), 4 stars=Good (ie. Contra),5 stars=Great (ie. Final Fantasy). Bad Dudes is a game that is fun and somewhat original, but every level has the same enemies - stupid lookingninjas in white and red with a few others mixed in once in a great while. Once you beat the game, there isn't much to do."
3,Secure Web Sites,The book gives all details that are needed to bring up a secure web site from nothing. A good read for a beginner in the e-era.
3,Fun but limited,"This is a fun little pop up book, but it's kinda small and I've certainly seen better. Still, every kid should have a pop up book."
1,"When this baby hits the 88 second mark, you will think this game is seriosly s###","This game has nothing to do with the movie. The only thing famileur is the logo and the clock tower that arnt anything more then the start screens.You run through the streets and have to collect a bunch of clocks while avoiding running into the hooler hoops girls and killer bee's and the ever so deadly park bench.This game has nothing to do with the movie at all. It's more like a run and dodge 'em game like Frogger only on a scrolling screen that seem's to go absolutly no where.The next game was a little better, but still only 1 stars, but least that game had the deloreon in it."
2,Very disappointed!,"I definitely don't recommend this book because Bobby Jones slanders people that he associated with and great gospel artists. I HAVE read the whole book and just taking a few parts out doesn't make it any better. Yes, thank God for Dr. Jones and what he has done for gospel music, but right is right and wrong is wrong, particularly when you're talking about other people. I found most of his comments insulting. He seems to have a ""high and lifted up"" attitude just because of he has high degrees and most other folks in gospel don't. He said a lot of things he should have kept to himself. That's why I don't understand why people are saying this book is great. Saints, please keep this man in your prayers."
1,So Embarassing!!!,"I am so embarrassed by the contents of this book.Dr. Jones is screaming out to know the ""real love"" of God. This book is full of negative comments about people God has used and continually uses to this day.Whatsoever things are true, honest, just, of good report, praise worthy...think/write on these things - Apostle PaulI pray that your eyes would be open to receiving ""love of God."" No one is against you but the devil."
4,Great tool!,"This book is a great learning tool. My voice teacher is using it to teach a small group of us better diction. We are currently only working on Italian but I have already learned so much. Who knew there were so many little rules governing diction?? If you are interested in improving your singing and performing, this book is a must have. It can be a little daunting to get through on your own which is why it is not 5 stars. If you have a teacher that can help you through it you will get much more out of it."
1,Not what I expected.,"Zours were always my favorite candy. I used to love all four flavors of them. Then they took out the tangerine and added in lemon and raspberry instead, both of which I dislike. I was very disappointed when they made that change. The reason I bought this box of Zours is because I thought they were the original flavors. Reason one is because it says Original right in the title. Reason two is because down below in the product description it states the four original flavors. I wouldn't have bought a huge 24 pack of Zours just because."
3,Not worth the money,These are as much as the ones in a gas station would cost but you get more at the gas station. You would think buying in somewhat bulk it would be a good deal. Box was a beat up too probably from staying overnight twice in Bethpage. Im just going to deal with what I got
2,Among the Let-downs,"During this interesting series, the protagionists were a group of third children living under a dictatorship with Chinese-style population laws. You follow about 10 kids through escapes and attacks from the goverment. The novel ends not even mentioning what happens to every one besides Luke Garner, in affect, dropping their characters like a rock. For some unknown reason, a despotism-style goverment ends suddenly when people get fed up with it. No mention is made of what happens to the Population Police's various resources, including: fanitical soldiers, gas, machine guns, tanks, the nation's food supply, a huge military, and a generation of brainwashed citizens. Presumably they all disappered. What then follows is a wad of pages just describing food. I take it no thought was given to what they would do after the all the feasts that effectivily demolish the food supply. If you must finish the series, rent it, but don't waste $17 like I did."
3,Not as good as Lunapads,"I've us ed Lunapads before but since it seems like Gladrags are more popular, I thought I'd try them as well.The pads are very soft and comfortable and I like the dark wine color they came in. They were much smaller (shorter) than expected, so I couldn't wear them at night. I find them a bit narrow to snap around the crotch of your underwear- there was a tiny bit of bunching.But here's why I prefer Lunapads (even though they are more expensive and not as widely available): I like that they have a base pad and the liners go ON TOP. They are easier to change and rinse that way."
4,Alternative to Disposable Pads,I bought these in an effort to reduce my carbon footprint. I think I have succeeded. The idea is foreign of washing ones sanitary napkins but I have already saved a great deal of money.
2,Not as shown,"Very disappointed with this product. I looked at lots of these pads for my daughter-- I want to start her off on the right foot and teach her about sustainability. I chose this product over others because of the bright colours, which I thought she would enjoy and be encouraged to use these over disposable pads. What I got was cream-coloured pads with a granny-type flower pattern. Yuk."
1,Not menstrual pads---they are panty-liners,"I was sorely disappointed when I received my $25 purchase in the mail--I thought they were actually day pads, but they were panty-liners, a 3-pack, which I can get at my local store for significantly less. I tried to return them but was unable to contact the distributor--so, beware!"
2,Way too small,"These pads are soft and well made, but are way too short and small. They're more like a mini pad than a maxi pad. I was disappointed, because the description on Amazon and on the company's website made them sound like they'd be the right size. In the future, I will be purchasing the larger size from this company."
4,very solid sound,"Very original sound, sounds kinda like mudvayne music with a gothic singer. like type o neg on vocals, the music has a goth under feel to it too. all in all worth the money, you wont be let down."
5,"Astoundingly creative, weird and entertaining","This collection of short stories is an imaginative, weird read. If you like horror and science fiction, and are looking for an author who really stretches boundaries well past the breaking point, look no further. Anti-mainstream, vivid, head shakingly weird - This book is a great intro to CM3. Highly recommended."
4,The basics translated,"A good solid, word for word translation of Apollodorus's collection of classical myths. Frazer's references to other similar tales is a great resource for folklorists and classics, both advanced and beginning scholars. The dry, simple text reflects the economy of the original well."
3,Book,My wife used this book to do the family tree of the Greek gods. It worked great. A lot of useful information.
2,A Stiff Risotto,"The adventures of a restaurant owner and two of her waiters who go to Aspen for a Chef's competition, and the challenges of the restaurant staff to run things while she's gone were light and humorous reading for the most part. The recipes throughout the book sound interesting. I was disappointed that the author found it necessary to use so many four-letter words and make tacky sexual references. It was offensive and didn't enhance the story."
2,The lenses scratch easily,I can be tough on safety glasses so it may be no fault of the mfg but IMO the lenses scuffed and scratched rather quickly.
4,"It was an excellent book, I recommend it to everyone.",This was an excellent book and couldn't put it down
5,Love this light fixture,This light fixture is even prettier in person. I love it and would definitely recommend it.
4,Appealing and Inspiring,"She was just a singing country girl who loved the Lord. But then, against all odds, America crowned her their idol.In this touching memoir, Fantasia Barrino describes her hardscrabble Southern upbringing, unplanned pregnancy and struggles with illiteracy after dropping out of school to raise her daughter. Both younger readers and adults will appreciate this candid, behind-the-scenes look at Barrino's rise to success - and the faith that made it happen. Appealing and inspiring."
3,"its not that the material is bad, it is simply repeated","The entire first disc is available on other Silva America CDs, (at the time the star wars tracks were the first release, but now they are on Music from the Star Wars saga), the rest on ""Space and Beyond"" ""Space and Beyond 2: Alien Invasion"", ""The Cult Files"" and ""Battlestar Galactica A-Z of SciFi/Fantasy TV Themes"". The re-recordings are cool but this is mainly a rehash of other cd's, as I said, the entire first cd is available on other Silva collections, and only 9 of the 15 tracks on cd 2 are not available on any other cd i own from Silva. (I don't have Cult Files re-opened or Space and beyond 3, who knows they might be on there)Obviously, when this album was originally released, the main appeal was the newly recorded star wars tracks, this cd has become more or less obsolete, its still a nice collection, but if you own the other Silva cd's. you don't really need this."
5,Great Book!,"This is the first book in our Real Estate office Book club. It has been inpsiring to read. Many of my thought habits are being challenged. The cobwebs of my mind are being cleared away and challenging me to not put up with mediocrity anymore and become more proactive about my position in my personal and professional life. It is especially enjoyable knowing it is written by a ""Layman"" who just discovered his longsuits and decided to utilized them."
1,let me re-review,"I had originally written a review saying how much I disliked this book. I tried to get through and didn't. I picked it up again a year or so later and found that it wasn't so bad. It's everything each review has said. It's witty, pretentious, interesting, babbling, snob-ish writing, observant and nicely anecdotal. I won't recommend this to everyone but it isn't as bad as some would think. Borrow it or get it from the library and you won't feel duped."
4,Paris to the Moon,"This book is actually a well written easy read- that is.... The author has a sincere love affair with Paris life, his family, and the experience of transplanting oneself into a different culture. I reccomend this book for anyone who wants to be charmed by Paris through the weary eyes of an American. His vision of romantic Paris is not quite as expected, but the love affair he has with the city anyway is the best part of this book."
5,Politics in France,This collection of essays gives you a glimpse into the world of French politics as a journalist seeks to understand his countrymen.
2,Boring and conceited,"I must echo those reviewers who say that this book is both a) a crashing bore and b) conceited. Gopnik's attitude is just grating. Also, I found his physical descriptions of Cressida a little disturbing. She was four years old, yet the way he described her beauty, you'd think HE was the one in love with her, rather than his son. I understand that he was doing it from the point of view of his son, but it still came off as a tad creepy.Save your money. Don't buy this book."
2,Pleasant but overrated,"This little book became a surprise hit--I can see why. It has charm, a certain wistful feel. Still, there is in fact precious little it has to say, and some of the chapters are simply tedious. I wish I could care about the child and the park ...The little set pieces offer relatively few insights on France, although they are well written. It sometimes seems like the obligatory ""I was there, now read this....!"" book. Nonetheless, it is a good beach read--but not deserving of its fame. It has none of the flair of Peter Mayle, for instance."
2,"Great City, Self-Indulgent Author or Toujours Gopnik","Is this the City of Lights or the city of self-promotion? Only Mr. Gopnik's agent knows for sure.If you love and admire Paris or simply yearn to visit it, you'll find wading through this book sightly less repugnant than a week in Chernobyl. Paris is a wonderful city whose charm Mr. Gopnik does indeed capture more than once. He'd capture it more often if his self-styled chic wasn't constantly getting in the way. OK, OK Adam, you're the best father there ever was and your son is about to matriculate at one of New York's most exclusive nursery schools. Whoop-dee-do! What was that you were saying about dusk on the Boulevard St. Germain?"
2,Gopnik does no favors for Parisian tourism,"The french tourism industry must be steaming over Gopnik's new book, Paris to the Moon, which makes Paris look more like the ""city of boredom"" than ""the city of romance."" The writing style is off-putting with run-on sentences and attempts to show off a pseudo intellectualism. A few rare moments of gleaming insight and humour hardly make up for the long periods of dull reading. I could have had a more enjoyable ""parisian experience"" sitting in my own living room with a cup of cafe au lait eating a croissant and listening to Edith Piaf...and saved alot more money too!"
4,C'est super cool,"What a wonderfully delicious book to finish by the fire on Christmas Day. Gopnick loves food, wine, his family, witty conversations, the little people and civilization. He gives us so many universal insights into our psyche... Paris to the Moon is a great read.... but especially for someone who has some background with the French and the City of Lights. Tres charmant. Bravo!"
4,Great book for optical filter design,"Madsen and Zhao did the leading work in this field, and this is their book. It has clear equations.If you are interesting in the digital optical signal processing, you must have this book on your shelf!"
5,Iron Fist is one of Marvel's most under rated characters,"This is how it all began. The 1970's was the height of the Kung-Fu crazy. Bruce Lee passed away and spawned dozens of wanna be imposters. Shang-Chi was the Master of Kung-Fu but Marvel wanted a hybrid Kung-fu master/super hero and Iron Fist was created to fit the bill.Recently, Iron Fist has made a comeback in the tremendous Immortal Iron Fist series so it's only proper that a Marvel Essential chronicling his early appearances comes out.Not only that but this book features the debut of one of the most famous Marvel mutants- Sabretooth!"
4,Bench Dog 10-019 ProCut and a Worm Drive Saw,The ProCut is a great idea. Wish I had it years ago. Did not try it with a right bladed circular saw since I now only use worm drive saws. It still works with a worm drive but there is only a small amount of procut bed under the saw. As a result you have to hold the saw up on the bed of the ProCut with a slight CCW twist of the wrist. Once you make your first cut the ProCut is customized for that saw.
2,Glue problem,I could not get the label glue off the guide so now it has rough scratch marks when it is supposed to be ultra smooth for saw safety.Check the label use removal whn you get this.. No good feature
1,Terrible. Don't waste your money.,"I tried two cans and both cans failed. The first one worked for about 5 seconds, then it started fizzing clear coat and propellant non-stop. I had to bag it in plastic and put it in a garbage can outside overnight so it could run itself out. I returned it for another can with pretty much the same results. It didn't fizz non-stop like the first one, but what did spray was propellant and occasionally the clear coat (mostly without glitter).After some online research, I found that this is a common problem. In fact, I read some reviews in which people had to go through 4 or more cans to get one that worked.What did apply looked great when it was dry. Too bad the spray cans are a total fail -- otherwise the results would be excellent."
3,Too Many Typos!,"I'm only now starting chapter 4. The information so far has been good, but there have been so many typos that it really detracts from the message. Kindle edition needs some definite editing!"
5,"Makes Great Coffee, Easy to Use",A Chemex is a beautiful thing. So simple to use and any coffee is somehow less bitter than the coffee yielded by other drip coffee makers. Plus it just looks cool and like it could be in a 17th century laboratory.
2,Nostalgic coffee maker,"I like the looks of the chemex and it performs well as a drip coffee maker.Unfortunatelly, the coffee is not hot enough when poured into cups"
3,Not like the food at the restaurant...,"After discovering a mutual love for cajun food, some Chicago natives recommended checking out Heaven On Seven whenever we got to Chicago - and we did. I had the Shrimp Voodoo, and remember loving it! The same friends later gifted us a signed version of this cookbook. We've tried a number of the recipes - even when often faced with daunting lists of hard to find ingredients like nectars. Almost anything we've tried is far too sweet and tastes nothing like the food we experienced at the resturant. Overall - this is a disappointment."
5,Giving away secrets...,"Why Chef Jimmy is so generous in sharing the actual recipes from his fantastic restaurant, I'll never know, but I'm not complaining. Used to eat at Heaven on 7 all the time while living in Chicago and now I can make some of my favorites at home far, far away. His honey-jalapeno dressing alone (good on salads, coleslaw, cornbread, crabcakes...heck, anything) is worth the price of the book. Buy it for yourself and as a gift for any cook/foodie friends."
3,"sprays great, but tends to leak and hard to toggle","I'm writing this review because I'm just about to order a replacement for this unit, not because it's worn out, but because it's so annoying. Although the spray it generates is great, and it can swivel better than anything else I've seen, the various connections tend to come unscrewed, causing leaks, and worse, it's difficult to change between spray and stream. For people with small/weak hands, it can be extremely frustrating to use."
2,It leaks after awhile,"I've used one of these for about two years now.Pros - The product itself is great. It has incredibly strong water pressure...so strong that most people who use my sink often put the water on too strong at first and water splashes all over the kitchen. It bends great so that you can easily reach every part of your sink. It also easily adjusts from a spray setting to a regular hose-like setting.Cons - one, and this, to me is a big one...it started leaking lately. At first it was just a bit of water when you had the pressure on really full. Now it is coming out every time I turn the sink on. I took the thing apart to see if maybe I had it mis-attached or it needed a new washer or something but it doesn't look like the leaks are coming from anything I can replace...I really didn't want to buy a new faucet head, but this one is pretty much unusable now so I guess I have to buy something...it is hard to decide to buy one of these again when I know it wore out so quickly."
1,terrible !!! Misrepresented!!!,"Not all metal, as advertised.....only connecting parts are metal. The head is all PLASTIC and mine broke after two weeks."
1,Consistently breaks,"Works great while it lasts, which is not long at all. I've tried about five of these and they have lasted from about one month to four months tops. They used to be quality, but aren't anymore. I'm going to try another brand now as I'm tired of returning these. The piece in the bottom falls out eventually and then never fits again properly. Avoid this product!"
4,Sprayer,Arrived very quickly and installed it on my laundry sink. works smoothly and we are very satisfied. I wouldcertainly recommend this to anyone that is looking for one.
3,Works well but wastes water,"It looks a lot nicer than the other similar sprayers, and it works well. however this product does not have an adequate flow-reducer in it, so twice as much water flows through it as through the original faucet aerator. I think California limits faucet aerators to 2 gpm, but this add-on apparently doesn't meet this. I was able to get the flow-reducer out of my old aerator and put it in this sprayer, and it still works well. It should come that way to save water."
2,"It works, but...","I've had both this, and theDanco 88270 360-Degree Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, Plastic, Chrome/White, and I prefer the Danco. It has a better spray pattern, and it's a bit shorter, which matters if you have a shallow sink, and need to fill up containers. They both have the handy double-ball-joint, so they can be directed whenever you need it. Neither this or the Danco will last for more than a few years before needing a replacement, for one reason or another. And since the Danco is half the price, and will last as long as the EuroJet, it makes sense to go with the one that's cheaper to replace."
3,Interesting if rather uninspiringly,maybe it was because Longstreet wasn't a very talkable sort I don't know but this book does provide some interesting insights and seldom bogs down.
1,What a waste!,"I have never found a Civil War book I did not enjoy, even the ones not worth reading.....until......I read Moxley Sorrel's book.It has no detail, it has no substantiated opinions, it has no documentation, and it says nothing new.An old man is entitled to such ruminations in private, but why inflict them on us?"
5,To The Manor Born: Silver Wedding Anniversary,"This is one of my favorite British programs.I have the complete series, and I was so happy that they made an anniversary special.Although some of the original characters have passed on, it was so nice to have many of the original ones still acting as stately, yet silly as they were 25 years ago...Highly recommended to anyone who loved the original."
3,drawers fall out,"this is a fine idea, the reviews that it is a reddish brown are correct. looks good but there is nothing to hold the drawers in. if you pull on them they come flying out of the unit on to the floor. if there are files towards the front of the drawer and the drawer is half open the drawer will spill forward and on to the floor. if someone bumps the unit the drawers fly out. no catch on them. too bad, if it had a system to keep the drawers in the unit would be great. too much money for no technical design."
3,Shut-up Tony,"The instruction in this book is easy to follow and teaches you the basic techniques you need to get a true bluegrass sound out of your banjo. The CD that comes with it, however, defeats it own purpose when Tony Trishka sings over the top of the banjo. Not only does he sound God-awful, but you can't even hear the music he's teaching you to play. Even on the instrumentals it gets frustrating because he's clearly not playing the exact same tab that is in the book. To his credit, however, every thing that is in the book, even the simplest 4 note exercises, are also on the CD.So 5 stars for the book, 2 stars for the CD, 4 stars for Tony's pickin', and 1 for his singing. Unfortunately this may be the best instructional book for bluegrass banjo beginners available. And I do recommend it. Just don't expect the CD to help you through your learning very much."
1,Plastic piece broke off,"I have had this hand blender for 2 years, but have only used it about 6 times. I pulled it out last week to blend some soup. The motor turned on but the blade did not spin. Had my husband look at it - the PLASTIC piece that makes the blade turn was broken. Why is Kitchen Aid selling $50 hand blenders that rely on a small piece of plastic to work? The device is only as strong as it's weakest part. The motor is doing me no good if the blade isn't spinning. What a scam - shame on you Kitchen Aid!"
1,Lousy blender broke after a year,"Absolutely the worst immersion blender I've ever owned. Bought it only based on a recommendation in Cook's Illustrated (since this isn't the first time, anything they promote I now take with a grain of salt). After little over a year of infrequent use (every 1-2 months or so), the bottom attachment pops out of the housing during blending; I was very careful not to use on thick liquids, since I have already fried 2 Braun stick blenders on mashed potatoes and liver pate, and those lasted me 4-5 years each. I own a mixer, toaster and food processor made by KitchenAid and they all work great. The blender says ""Made in China"", so let that be a warning. Complete waste of money."
1,Junk.,The unit broke the 3rd time I used it. The 3 times it did work it just was not power full or easy to use. The button is hard to push and the cord is to short... You can do much better then this thing.
1,Not worth the money,"This blender broke down after only a few uses when I was trying to crush ice. Luckily, it was still under warranty, and they replaced it for free. However, the replacement also broke down after a few uses when I was making smoothie with frozen strawberries. I don't think I was being unreasonable in expecting it to make smoothie with no problem. When I contacted Kitchen Aid, they said that it's warranty has expired and offered me a ""special"" to buy another one for a reduced price. Even though it's been over a year since I had purchased the product, I hadn't used it that much because I have a Vitamix blender that I use for most of my blending jobs. I usually make my smoothie in the Vitamix, but I thought I would try the hand blender. What a mistake. I would not buy another Kitchen Aid product."
2,Great concept,"The concept was great, but alas, every concept has it's flaws. There is no quick fix to any problem. I tried all her suggestions for products and broke out like a teenager! Also, web site support is poor and products don't match what is in the book. Can't even get a response from the e mails I sent asking questions."
5,AMAZING Book,"worth every penny , this book help me get rid of dual skin ,acne, and help me maintain it , I love the way she list the product that is suitable for each type of skin from the cheapest to the most expensive.In the few first chapters she explain skin layers , and then there is an assessment to get to know your type of skin , with is consist of 4 type for every person , i lend my book to all many of my friends and truly so the difference."
2,Crapola,"This is my fifth or sixth mp3 player, I've owned it for nearly two months, and I plan to buy another one already... First and foremost, this little energy sucker needs to be recharged at least daily. I listened to it on my way to work this morning (25 minutes), turned it off before I went to work, and, by the time I was ready to go home for the day, it was already dead. I charged it overnight, never turned it on, and woke up the following morning to go run... dead again. Never had transfer issues and sound quality is great, but what's the point if it only works for an hour before dying? Has no way to attach to a carry sling, so you have to buy the Zen Stone arm or wrist band or you're stuck carrying it in your pocket. (Did I mention the armband snapped as I was putting the Zen Stone in it for the first time?) This is my third ""charge by PC"" mp3 player, and my very last. I'm going back to SanDisk with a AAA battery, despite its size. (At least it actually works!)"
1,Keep Looking,"I bought this for use in my car only, but it's not useful. I drive 1 hour to work and 1 hour back and it's dead by the time I get home. Downsides: the screen is too small to be useful, the item needs to be charged daily and for long periods of time, there is no battery-low indicator so the item just stops, very hard to turn on/off (must hold switch for a long time), has 'frozen' twice and needed to be reset. Upside: Very compact, lightweight, sound is good, the headphones are nice and the color (red) is nice. I've been looking at newer mp3 models and c'mon.. there is much better to choose from! Give this one a pass."
4,Good,Performs according to my expectations so far.Previous blenders from other brands only lasted about 6 month... hopefully this one will last longer
5,good for ages 0-100,"This is a great product whether you are on a diet, a new mom making baby food or pureeing food for an older person... it is powerful and easy to clean. I am so glad that I added it to my kitchen."
3,it was ok,"yo, this record was aight i think the beats could of been betta but otha then that it was pretty tight"
4,"Another ""under the radar"" release","Once again JH has put out another stellar cd. If only people here in the states would listen to this music,they would realize just how good groups like JH,Gotthard,and House of Lords are.Anything that these guys put out is worth whatever you pay for it (within reason,of course). Be sure to check out ""The Journey will never end"" as well as ""Trust"" by these guys. You'll be glad that you did."
2,Not too good,"I've seen alot better videos out there. The moving the legs and arms were not effective exercises and the abs section is not challenging. I'd skip, this is the worse review I've ever done."
1,I Would Not Recommend This Video,"As someone who has worked out regularly, for over a decade, I would not recommend this video to the beginner or the advanced fitness person. The primary review of the video is correct, that the instructor does not offer adequate instruction and gives no clear direction on how to perform the movements, so the video will be too confusing for the beginner. For the intermediate and advanced, the video is far too short and is limited (and elementary) in the exercises performed, so that one is not truly getting a good workout for abs or arms. This video should not be entitled ""best""."
5,great intro and history,"This program is by far the best I have seen, and I have seen a few on the subject. What I liked the most about it is 1) the intruction is in depth and well conveyed and 2) it includes some real history that explains the origins of Qi Gong with Tai Chi master Jian Liu Jun sharing his personal knowledge of the 4,000-year-old practice.I learned about this DVD set from an article in Exclusive Magazine where the writer wrote ""As soon as this DVD starts you know you're onto something good"". Now that I have seen it, I have to agree."
5,taleofmurasaki,"The Tale of Murasaki is a delight. Genuinely poetic, describes an exquisite culture with a ring of authenticity -- that's what Dalby's good at after her geisha experience. For more details of the Heian era and the main characters check the cool website."
5,Murasaki unveiled,"Anyone who has ever itched to hear more about the mysterious Lady Murasaki will adore this gorgeous and clever novel. Not only does Dalby illustrate her vast knowledge of Japanese culture, but she also displays her incredible talent to weave history and fiction in a most readable fashion. Dalby knits Lady Murasaki's own poems and memories (recorded in the famous court lady's diary) into a story which curiously and wonderfully parallels The Tale of Genji, while presenting a guess at what her life may have been like. The result is a work of fiction which is artistic, poignant and spiritual; I couldn't put it down."
5,AMAZING!,"This is just an amazing cd. It starts off with super catchy Long Way To Fall and just doesn't quit. Every song is filled with bone-crushing guitars, heartfelt lyrics, emotional vocals, and its all topped off with a crisp sound. All this results in an excellent cd that I would recommend to everybody who likes New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, or other bands like that."
1,I hated this book,"If you have an old barn and want to get some ideas and inspiration for making a lovely living space without sacrificing the integrity and charm of the original, this book is not for you. I wish I had seen the review that appears before mine before I bought it. Soulless says it all. And most of the barns pictured are in Europe, to boot, except for one in Charlottesville that is so over the top, I thought I was looking at a cardboard model at first. This would be a great book if you have an airplane hangar you want to convert, but spare the barns."
1,Severe irritation w/newer product,"I have been using the beard formula every two weeks for the past 4 years with absolutely no irritation or negative reaction of any kind. The last box caused burning, oozing, blisters, welts, you name it. WTF did they do? I am not allergic to anything and this is no allergy... it's an acid burn... You've been warned... again..."
1,Caveat emptor!,"While this product does a good job of doing what it is advertised to do, the past few packages I have purchased have caused major skin irritation. The last time I used it (within the past five days), the irritation was so serious that it caused pustules to appears that started bleeding when rubbed with a kleenex. Evidently the formula has been changed, as when I started using Just For Men Beard and Mustache color, I had no problems at all. I have never had sensitive skin or skin irritation problems in the past. Because of my recent bad experience with this product I have now discontinued using it."
4,does the job,The product does what it promises. It covers the gray and helps me look younger. Looks natural. I have used this product for over a year.
1,Like Napalm on Your Face,"Beware! I just threw my box of this stuff away in case it would ignite in my bathroom cabinet. While it does effectively color your beard, the chemical burn makes you wonder how it got past the FDA. I used this product years ago with no ill effects that I can remember. However, this ""new"" formula that everyone's talking about is dangerous. I had to rub a prescription strength corticosteroid cream on my face to get relief -- and even that took several hours. Beware!"
3,Flawed packaging,"I am generally pleased with the way the product shades my beard, but my argument is with the packaging. The tube of color developer when new sometimes is very difficult to unscrew. It is possible to actually snap the top off the tube rendering it unusable ($7 down the ""tubes""). If this doesn't happen initially, it can sometimes happen later after a few uses. It has happened to me 4 times--no matter how careful I try to be. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any competition in the market place otherwise I wouldn't hesitate to try another product.I also initially had a skin reaction but found that the following works for me: Do not shave before using this product; Try to brush only the hairs and avoid as much as possible getting the product directly on your skin; After waiting (no more than 5 minutes) wash vigorously, scrubbing the beard and skin(I shower and brush my beard and skin with shampoo); Thoroughly rub a 1% cortisone cream solution into the beard and skin."
1,med brown turns red,"I have used this product in the past with no problems, very satisfied with the results.The last few applications have been extremely itchy, and after three days or so, my facial hair starts turning red.........WTH......?....."
1,WARNING!!!,"I also have used JFM for years trouble free. Not sure what they (JFM) did to the product , but now it causes me SEVERE ITCHING and BURNING"
1,New Formula....IT BURNS !!!,"I have used this product for years. I was wondering what had happened since now I am getting burns and blisters and irritation on my sideburns after using it. If it has a new formula, as others say here, then it all makes sense. Do the skin test before using it. I personally will not and will try to find some other better product that does not cause side effects."
5,Illustrations are fabulous!,The stories are great to read aloud to children and all of the children in my reading group were especially intrigued by the illustrations. Hope to see more books by this talented duo!
4,"Glad to have this generator, but...","I purchased this generator from a local dealer without the standard transfer switch (instead I upgraded to a 100A whole house switch so I did not have to pick the circuits to be on the generator). Overall, it works great, but my only complaint is that it seems to have a hard time maintaining a steady voltage, which results in my UPS's (on my computers) to cycle wildly on and off as the voltage goes back and forth from 126 to 120 VAC. The dealer (and Generac) indicate that this is 'normal' (as the specs promise a +- 5VAC), but the dealer is going to try to make some adjustments.From what have read, some of the 'better' UPS's can handle this fluctuation better, but I thought people should be aware of this before purchasing any generator for their house where sensitive electronics exist."
4,A good book on I/O design!,"Today it is hard to find a book dealing with ESD and IO design comprehensively, and this book is a make-up. It covers ESD theories, prevention techniques and layout, basic IO transceiver design, mixed-voltage IO cell design and etc. Unfortunately, the authors did not address some of the designs in depth, as its title is ""Basic ESD and I/O Design""."
2,"Very nice, but not repairable","Rating: 5 stars for usefulness, 0 stars for support and repairability.Love this unit - incredibly useful and powerful. Don't know how we lived without it. However, simple $0.25 part breaks and you have to throw it away.The plastic drive coupling failed - simple inch-long part that I was able to remove in 30 seconds. Whirlpool (KitchenAid parent company) does not sell repair parts for this unit. I can't fix it - have to throw it away.Pretty obvious that this is a likely part to fail, and the only option is to buy a whole new unit. Disgusting. If you want a long-term relationship, buy something else."
4,Barb H,The blender works excellent and the power is very good. The only problem was the heigth because it did not fit on the counter below my cupboard. I would recommend this to any one wanting a powerful hand blender.
5,Great substitute for travel,"I got this for making green smoothies while traveling. I have a vita mix for home use. It did a great job of blending up the tough greens. It's sturdy, easy to use. The only thing I'd improve on it is that the blending container is on the small side. Comes with a neat cloth bag to put it in."
5,Excellent blender and chopper,"I purchased the KitchenAid hand blender as a gift for my sister-in-law and used it for a week while visiting her. I have a Braun that I love and wanted to give her the same but they weren't available anywhere so I took a risk and bought her the KitchenAid hoping that it would be close. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. The KitchenAid was actually a bit better. It has several speeds so I could easily grind up frozen parmesan and the containers were larger and nicer than my Braun stuff. I have to say I was initially very disappointed not to be able to find the Braun on the market but if I had to replace my own blender I would buy this exact KitchenAid product. It's excellent for blending soups, whipping cream, chopping veggies, etc. etc. It really makes so many cooking tasks easier."
5,Most useful item in my kitchen,"I have had this for almost 5 months and use this for almost everything. The chopping accessory is great for onions, tomatoes, etc. I do a lot of Indian cooking and this is a huge time saver. Easy to clean. A ton of power. Have had to use my regular hand blender as this has so many accessories. The balloon wisk is great for whipped cream, and egg whites, etc. Cannot recc. this enough. Use this every time I cook."
1,Not too happy,"At first I thought this was an amazing blender. But after about a dozen uses the motor stopped turning. It feels strong and looks strong but now it's a white elephant instead of an immersion blender. Evidently, it just stopped working while it was sitting in the drawer. I had it less than 4 months."
3,"Nice blender, but I don't like the chopper","The stick blender is WONDERFUL.I just love making homemade salad dressings with it. It goes nicely in the top rack of the dishwashers. No fuss, no muss.This whisk is a great feature as well.However, if you have carpel tunnel or other had issues, you might have trouble detaching the blade from the base unit.My only complaint is that the cover of the chopper attachment retains water that takes days to drain and/or dry up after washing it. I don't think that this is sanitary, so I no longer feel comfortable using the device as a chopper."
2,KitchenAid Hand Blender,"I used the hand blender for mashed potatoes the low speed is still to mush and the whip attachment had stopped and the moter was still running, not good. I had to get out the super glue to keep the motor and the whip working together. We are a family of three so it was a small amount of potatoes."
1,Stick with a regular blender,"I wanted this to work. I make soup a couple of times a month and wanted to be able just to blend in the pot rather than tediously using the blender acouple of times. I also knew that Cooks Illustrated rated this product highly, as far as hand blenders go. It just doesn't work nearly as well as a regular blender. All the soups were still grainy until I would put them in the regular blender. What a disappointment and a waste of my money."
4,Great value for biscuits,These are the exact same #10 biscuits that I buy at the local home centers. Been paying a little over 7 cents per biscuit. This deal is 2.346 cents per biscuit. The only problem so far has been a few broken pieces and several are way thinner than usual. I use the broken pieces where I have a half-slot.
3,"Good detail, board too tight.",My son love's his new chess set. My only complaint is that it is that the board is too tight. Would be nice if it was a few inches wider to give the pieces more elbow room.
1,Heads break off everytime one is dropped.,"I bought this several years ago because I thought it looked cool and my boys and husband love to play chess. I was poorly made and hard to play with due to the ornamentation of the pieces. The worst thing was that the heads constantly fell off every time they were dropped (even on the table). I spent many years glueing them back on, but now it it going to the thrift store."
2,Poor customer service from vendor,"Order the 80 grit sanding disc pak and received 120 grit instead, not just a mistake the actual invoice for the 80 grit was crossed out and the ""120"" written in marker!"
4,Rich pictorial content to stimulate your own decoration idea,"While the book is indeed very heavy (hope they have a paperback version), among more than a dozen decoration books I found in book stores, I actually enjoyed browsing through this book the most. There is rich pictorial content to stimulate ideas for decorating your places to fit your own style. The book helped me quickly get a feeling of what styles or the combinations of them that I like or dislike. Also got small ideas here and there that can be quite useful. Bottom line: a good start point."
5,Powerful gets the job done,"I use this to make soups,sauces, salsa, and mix cake/cookie dough without any problems. It also has 9 speed levels for different jobs. The attach and detach button attachment is very sturdy. Overall it was a good buy."
3,"Excellent blender, but does not last forever","I purchased this blender five years ago and have been very pleased with its performance. It has had very heavy use, including a partially melted cord, and given me no problems. Now, however, I have to replace it as the plastic teeth in the head that mesh with the motor have worn down over time. I have researched other blenders, however, and it seems to be a universal problem of immersion blenders. And so I am purchasing another from KitchenAid, despite the problems. Now I suppose I'll have two motors."
4,It works,"I bought this because it was rated highly by 'america's test kitchen', and it was available for a good price. I have never owned an immersion blender before so I cannot compare to others. The model I bought does not have accessories, but I don't think they are necesary. The reviews I read, mention that this has a strong motor, and the stainless shaft does not stain like plastic. The only problem I have is finding a place to put it when not using it."
5,Love it Love it Love it!,"I use this for my morning shakes. I was thrilled that it was simple to use, very powerful, it tackles whole frozen strawberries with the power just half way to full throttle! I'm also happy that it didn't come with a bunch of foo-foo attachments that I don't need. The beaker is PERFECT again for my shakes, and has a great, airtight lid for the car rides.Very happy customer, and recommended the same exact one to my sister who bought one!"
5,Wonderful Tool!,"I couldn't be happier with this immersion blender. It is strong, efficient and fast. Though it's size is a bit larger than the blender I had in the past, it's quality is worth the little bit of extra space it takes up in my kitchen. I highly recommend this KitchenAid tool!"
3,way bigger than i thought it would be,I didn't try it out- just returned it. I just shopped online and wanted the highest rated hand blender. this is a professional model. I'm sure it's a terrific blender but it was just alot bigger than the Braun we had at home that I was replacing. Be sure you look at these before buying to make sure it's what you want.
4,I have the similar white model but need a new one....,"I am still using the white plastic version of this blender...I got the full kit (whisk, etc.) via rewards points a couple of years ago.It is still working perfectly...however, the plastic covering the cord wires has split and I the wires are exposed. I put some electrical tape on, but it really isn't working that well anymore, so it's time to replace the unit, just to keep safe.Overall I have loved my old white version, but I would prefer the darker color...the white is OK, but since it's well used there is some slight staining.The power is still there after about 2 years of daily use. I use it to mix up a supplement I have to take...powder, which which blend with fruit and water...sort of like a smoothie. It's not especially taxing on the unit.I could have gotten a Viking with rewards points, but the reviews aren't that good for that unit. So, I'd prefer to buy the Kitchen Aid because I've been very happy with it overall...except for the cord."
2,Breaks easily and no replacement parts,"I have had this blender for about 2 years and I only use it occasionally to blend soups or shakes. It worked great for a while. The entire machine is well made and the motor is strong - except for a small plastic piece that sits above the blade. When this plastic thing loosens, then food gets stuck behind it and the blender no longer chops. It is impossible to reinsert it so that it does not come loose again. And there are no replacement parts available, so you just have to buy a whole new blender. I would buy a different blender that did not have a cheap plastic piece in a critical area - which is being immersed into hot and cold liquids. My mistake this time for not thinking about this - but I would not recommend this blender."
2,Way too powerful,"This blender feels like a professional-quality tool, heavy and well-made. But it's just way, way too powerful to be of any use to me. Even on the lowest setting, it flings my ingredients across the kitchen whenever I try to use it on anything less than several quarts of liquid.If you normally cook in cauldrons and are feeding an entire football team, then this device is for you. But if you just want to puree the vegetables in a quart of gazpacho, you're going to end up scraping your soup off the walls."
2,Pretty Vacant,"If I was feeling charitable I'd say that this was an excellent read. Unfortunately for Messirs Monk and Guterman that I've read too many excellent books about the same subjects that covered them much better.England's Dreaming for a general 'punk' overview, John Lydon's autobiography for literary style (and fun reading), Bob Geldof's 'Is That It?' for an alternate viewpoint on the general consensus. These are three pretty much essential books for the average punk reader, and they're not the only ones.But aside from the tour photos, this book's tone is just way over-the-top, in a rock-star fashion that the Pistols were trying not to achieve. Some interesting tidbits (not for the timid) about Sid's increasing drug problems, but the tour was so short it hardly warranted the creation of an entire book.There are no insights to be found here, but as a coffee table book (if your coffee table happens to be located in a Turkish Prison) it could pass the time."
1,Logistics Business Management,I never received my book. I paid for it but NEVER got it!!!! Not very happy
4,good summary of trends during these periods,"I loved the pictures and the categories, especially the 60's, but found the misprints and some information annoying, for example inserting something from 20 years later. Would have liked less repetition of similiar items."
3,Ditch the sex,"This is the first of the new ""Romantic SF"" books I've read and I'm not sure this new genre works that well. Sinclair's plot and SF elements are very good, the characters are pretty good, but the romance part of the story is a little much. I ended up skipping most of the big sex scene because it totally breaks up the flow of the story. The only advantage I can see to having ""Romantic SF"" is because it brings in new readers to SF who will hopefully stick around to read the really good stuff. Without the sex!"
2,Romance Novel,"I picked the book up at the store based on several criteria.1. Science Fiction2. Publisher - Bantam Spectra usually publishes good work.3. Babe on the picture. (I admit not the best criteria)What did I get? A 453 page romance novel. I guess the hottie on the cover should have given it away but the back blurb did sound interesting ""independent trader"" rescuing a ""Zafharin military officer."" But what you get is a strange mix of Star Wars, Moonlighting and Privateer. Female Han Solo and genetically engineer super soldier, for some reason, fall in love and out of love and in love and out of love and guess what at the end they fall back in love. Keep in mind that this creche raised Alexander has never shown emotion in his entire life and after a couple of minutes with Han he is going to through it away for her love. Maybe it was the knock on the head. The main plot of interstellar war, betrayal and trading all vanish in this syrup of true love.Too bad it wasn't a paraody."
3,An Hasidic Romance Tale,"This was the second book by Naomi Ragen that I've read, and while I enjoyed more than ""The Sacrifice of Tamar,"" I found it lacking. I liked the slow, gradual unfolding of Dina's character and history, but it shows that what the book is truly about could have been written in half the amount of pages. Dina's ""punishment"" seemed unrealistic and contrived to me.Ms. Ragen does have a way about her in telling a story, but her plots are overly predictable. This truly became apparent after I had read two of her books. Maybe she has expanded her storylines, but I doubt I shall seek her out in the future.However, in all fairness to the author and fellow readers, I am not particularly a fan of romance novels and both of the books I read by Ms. Ragen were loaned to me. If one likes to read romance, I am certain they will find this book interesting, engaging, and fulfilling."
5,Best reference out there for the CDL driver!,This is by far the best reference out there for the CDL driver. Many schools use it. If yours doesn't you should be asking them why. Great for the student and great as a gift to that student CDL driver.
5,A CTD Instructor from GA,"As a commercial truck driving instructor, I realize there are a lot of different sources out there that claim to be the ""ultimate"" guide to tractor trailers and the trucking industry in general. Bumper to Bumper is our institute's text of choice. It is clear and concise and pretty accurate in its descriptions of the industry. It is also one of the best guides for getting to know your truck. I highly recommend this book for the newbies and ""old"" pros. 'Cause even though you can't teach an old dog new tricks even those who've been on the road for a while will benefit from taking a look at this book."
1,boring!,"This is the most boring, stupidest, piece of crud i have ever seen. If you are smart, never, ever, even think about buying this toy. Only an idiot would go ahead and buy it after i told you this. It is a huge dissapointment, I used two weeks of allowence to buy this, and when I took him out of the box and put batteries in, I almost cried."
2,Neither CMOS nor TTL,"Be aware that the input thresholds for logic 1 and 0 are not CMOS and they are not TTL. Since the probe doesn't have a selector switch for CMOS/TTL (why?) the maker chose to use a blend of the two specs. If you can find a copy of the spec sheet you will see what I mean, but it does not treat a 2.5V signal as a TTL logic 1.The legitimate TTL threshold is above 2.1V for logic 1 and below 0.8V for a logic 0. This makes the probe UNUSABLE for TTL in my opinion. I have a BSEE and 35+ years experience in logic and instrument design.The logic pulser feature is almost worthless. It runs continuously at one of two (switch selected) speeds with no push button to allow one pulse injection. The pulser OUTPUT is from a separate tiny terminal on the probe body and requires a jumper lead (which they do include) to connect the pulse to the circuit under test. NOT satisfactory!2 stars because it does work as a simple CMOS logic probe, kinda. Not worth the money."
2,don't fall for it,"I don't know if the product works...I've tried it, and see no difference.But, what I do know is that the packaging is flawed...the spongey like applicator deteriorates within weeks...I called the company and got a replacement...this is a problem they are well aware of...the second applicator fell apart also, within weeks.Save your money...try something else...this is definitely not a solution to any problem, and is a waste of money."
1,Must Have !,"I couldn't resist any longer. Not only does Bare Escentuals make me feel I am doing all that I can for my complextion during the day time, now I feel I am doing the same at night time. Bare Escentuals has changed the way I feel about make up."
3,Interesting look at BOTH sides of the debate in a small town,"I read this book in College.It's not a definitive work of the entire debate, but does raise different sides of the argument regarding choice and abortion. I found it to be a balanced book. The author spoke to women engaged in the Choice debate from both sides of the fence one town/city. WHile this may not be the case now, the women knew eachother and eachother's organizations, and were, in some cases, very collegial. I would recommend this book quite highly."
3,Nice wrestling book,"I found this book to be a good one for high school kids in sports. It's a bit simple, but shows in a few chapters the life of a srong-willed young boy in search of victory on the mat. I like how it doesn't falsify the heroism in sport, but showcases a realistic approach. For a more literary and harrowingly truthful novel about wrestling, though, I much preferred PINS by Jim Provenzano. It delves further into the trials of weight-cutting, homophobia in sports and larger issues facing kids."
4,Very good product.,"Pros:A very nice prduct for the money.DVD RAM is very flexible, and the unit can read/write most types of DVDs.Allows naming or disks and chapters. Has a great feature to save text chunks that you want to frequently re-use.Comes in black.Can use DVD-RAM disks that come in a cartridge.Informative OSD.Fairly easy to use.Easy initial set-up.Cons:DVD RAM is great, but a little slow on first insert of a blank disk.The unit can be slow to boot.Possibly grainy/fuzzy on the CATV passthrough.No ""last"" or ""skip-back"" function on the remote.Not easy enough for ""gramps"".No front-panel clock display when unit is ""off"".No front-panel clock display at times depending on OSD settings.Slow to auto-set time."
5,What a Machine!,"This is a great machine. I wanted a way to save programs from my DVR to DVD and this Panasonic is just the ticket.My oldest son is an A/V professional and he always praises Panasonic's engineering, reliability, and price. Once again - he's right. This machine sets up quickly and comes with clear instructions for using the different types of recordable DVD media available.The only shortcoming I found with this machine is a personal wish for a few more standard outputs, but my A/V setup is somewhat complex.If you simply want to record to DVDs, this machine will make you a satisfied customer."
4,"powerful hand blender, but the size is quite big.","Pros : powerful, can chop fruit into fine puree in seconds.Cons : clumsy, and big in size, not easy for small hand,power cord is not long enough.Plastic container comes with it is the best place to do theblending, need to hold the blender with and up and down motionto improve blending and chopping.It is a good milk shake machine, like the one in fast foodrestaurant."
1,Upgrade? What upgrade?,"Upgrade? What upgrade? The older versions were much better than this one. This new version runs very slowly, adds redundant and unneeded tags and crashes more often than Windows 98!Please just don't buy this product, don't waste your money."
3,good for children,"Please don't play this game if you are over the age of 12. This is entirely a children's video game, and children will enjoy playing it, if they're fans of Big Bird. It's amazing how many children's games are on the market. Many of them are extremely well-done and give the player a great learning experience. This is another good one."
5,LOVE,These work great on the cosleeper I have and I love how it doesnt have velcro the one that comes with the cosleeper has velcro and sticks to everything in the wash.
3,It's alright...,"When they say control, they mean incredibly restricting. Personally, I was just looking for a cute and serviceable bit of shapewear, but nothing extensive. When (if) you get this on, it is really firm. Definitely a plus for some, but really not what I was looking for."
1,Dont try,I had tried and bought a 3 month supply and it DOES NOT WORK. I used it for 2 months and figured what the heck i have another month ill use it. It showed no progress I'm still as little as I was before. One thing is i think it made me grow hair on neck which is gross!! so I'm hoping that the hair will stop growing now that I've stopped taking it.
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"Not much to really say about this optical mouse. I use this when I'm rebuilding machines and it does what it's supposed to do. I haven't had any problems with the mouse squeaking (as another reviewer posted) so I can't really comment on that. If you're looking for an inexpensive and wired optical mouse, then this one should work fine for you."
3,"Good, comfortable mouse but...","The ergonomic shape of this mouse make it quite comfortable to use, however it squeaks. I know real mice squeak, but computer mice shouldn't. The way the buttons are assembled creates a bit of friction. At first the noise was so subtle, I was in fits trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. Now, it's every press of the button. It doesn't really bother me but if you're the type to be driven nuts by noises, stay away from this mouse."
5,Highly Recommended No Matter When You Miscarried,"My miscarriage was quite a while ago- about four years. I've had a healthy son since, but I've never quite gotten over my miscarriage. I Never Held You, (the title expresses exactly how I feel), has helped me tremendously. This book brought about the awareness that I never completed a grieving process, and although I've been blessed with a healthy child, I didn't mourn the baby I miscarried. I see how burying my feelings only served to hurt me more, even when I thought I was 'okay'.Note: In the tools for living section- As a Certified Fitness Trainer and Instructor, I appreciate and agree 100% with the section on the benefits of exercise in stress reduction, regardless of what kind or where you do it.I commend both Ms. DuBois and Dr. Backman for such a helpful, warm and sympathetic book that carries a woman through her miscarriage and far beyond into the rest of her life."
2,Ughh,"This is one of the most boring textbooks I have ever needed to read. I love history and studying the subject should not be like hitting yourself in the head with a 30 pound brick, the equivalent, as a matter of fact, of this book."
3,lots of info.....grammatical nightmare,Do i hear run on sentences and extremely unneccessary words? This book is full of them. Jumps around from dates to dates....writers choose to use words that are so superfluous the true meaning is contorted. Many grammatical errors. Truly awful writers and I'm guessing extremely underpaid editors.
5,The Forgotten Winans,"Daniel looks to Andrae Crouch as a mentor. And well he should. Daniel takes the same kind of changes. One minute he has a New Jack Swing kind of groove (Hot Rain), then he goes Jazz and then accapella Doo Wop. I still listen to this one when it crosses my mind.Highlights: Kacy/ Holding OnTruSoulDJ"
2,Revenge of the Whale,"Revenge of the Whale is a survival suspense novel. Anyone who enjoys classic survival fiction like My Side of the Mountain and suspense novels like the Harry Potter books will enjoy Revenge of the Whale. It is hard to put down because the person who wrote it did such a good job ending chapters with cliffhangers. One such example is the last sentence of Chapter 3: ""Nickerson's judgment: `This should not have been.'""This book is about 14-year-old Thomas Nickerson, the cabinboy of the whaleship Essex. He and the 20 other men aboard the Essex deal with bad luck, broken and battered whaleboats, and one very angry sperm whale. The story starts with the sailors going aboard the Essex and sailing from Nantucket. They suffer a knockdown early in their voyage, a sign of the many trials they will soon face. Who will survive? Will young Thomas Nickerson live to tell the tale? Find out when you read Revenge of the Whale!"
3,Good Leg Workout But Editing Needs Help,"The leg workout is great once you get the hang of it, but the camera cuts away just when you want to see how to do the move. If you go through the tape a few times you don't notice it."
2,A let down of a return,"This is the game no one knew about and wanted to know about, as the soldiers from the original Contra are back for another similtaneous two player side scrolling shooting adventure battling against an alien assult on earth. The game is as difficult as ever, because when you get hit by an enemy you die. The challenge is nice with new challenges from the original game from aliens, armies, tanks and killer machines. The big let down of the game is the graphics and the gameplay are very poor especially compared to the original Contra. Also this game is very dated. There is not much to say about this game, other than skip it!"
2,"Interesting, sort of ambient stuff","Interesting, sort of ambient stuff - when Mike Patton's voice spoke though my headphones, it was a highlight for me listening though the disc."
4,In the tradition of the great short story writers,"Though reminiscent in some ways of the work of Ronald Firbank, Baron Corvo, and Howard Overing Sturgis, Mr. Haslett writes with a style and psychological acuity that is entirely his own. Consider a cross between Katherine Mansfield and Steven Carter, between Virginia Woolf and the Charles Reich of The Sorcerer of Bolinas Reef, between Max Beerbohm and Dennis Cooper -- and that will give you some idea of the elegance and the real sensitivity of Mr. Haslett's writing."
4,"Touching, Haunting Stories","This debut volume of short stories by Adam Haslett begins with six of the most haunting stories I have read in a long while. The last three short stores, while very good, do not reach the same level as those first ones but it is a relief to step back a little from the power and the pain. Mental illness, grief and loss form a common thread throughout the book. The title of the volume comes from the words of one of the characters but the words of another could just as easily have substituted, ""We will survive this"". Somehow the characters do survive, just barely and with their pain a throbbing wound, but they do survive and the author brings us gently and persuasively to this understanding that people can and do survive just about anything. The stories should make you cry a little, feel a little empty for a moment, and then give you your breath back as you contemplate their jagged beauty. A gem of a book."
2,vastly overrated,"the first story rocks, but the tail off is obvious. i bought this after all the hype, and hoped haslett was the real deal, but he's no where near the talent he's made out to be. his general gimmick is to find characters suffering some GREAT CRISIS (dead or crazy parents seems a fave) and document their mechinations. he does an adequate job, no better. he should be thanking his lucky stars he had celebrity sponsors."
1,Here Comes Trouble,Worked great for 18 months then died . No power opened it up and capacitor is spread open on top. Seems others have had no power problems. Was nice when it worked but dies to soon.Paid $180 expect more then 18 months.
1,Very Disappointing,"I am very disappointed with this language program. This CD gives you very little chance to practice phrases and vocabulary (as opposed to most language programs that have you listen and repeat over and over). Plus, the exact pronunciations are difficult to hear making it impossible to develop any confidence in your speaking abilities. With so many language programs available, I would never recommend this one."
1,Not your father's Saf-T-Pops,"Yuck! What a disappointment! I ordered these because I was looking for some candy with the flavors of my childhood (Cherry, Lime, Orange, etc.,.) I don't know what some of the flavors in this box are supposed to be, but they are *not* the Saf-T-Pops of my youth. Even if you put that aside, the quality of these candies is poor. The flavors are indistinct and odd, with combinations of flavorings I can only describe as ""wrong, terribly, horribly, wrong"". If any one knows of a quality US, Canadian, or Western European hard candy with clean flavors which include Lime, Cherry, and Orange, please leave a comment letting me know about it, and where it might be available. And, if you, like me, are seeking a source for same, Saf-T-Pops is not the answer."
5,Lovely,"Beautiful charted flowers, a very worthy successor to ""Decorative Victorian Needlework"". Book is organized by the seasons. A sampler for each season and several floral designs for each season. Informative, detailed, a conversion chart for the different brand needlepoint wools, and instructions on the preferred needlepoint stitch for working E. Bradley's designs. Plus, the delightful surprises in E. Bradley's books, in this one you must see the Plum Pudding chart. What a delightful Christmas gift a plum pudding ornament would be."
5,Heartbeat's Soundtrack brings this film to life,"A great long form video that first premiered on HBO. No dialog...just a visual story set to the lyrics of the very underrated album of the same name. Look for Lori Singer, Paul Shaffer, Luis Guzman, Angela Alverado, David Carradine and many others. ""Streetwise"" is featured, a song that appeared in a Miami Vice episode but not on the Heartbeat album. This needs to be out on DVD!"
3,Moscheles again,Both CDs by this composes arrived veryquickly from Virginia and in excellentcondition.I cannot rave about this vendor highlyenough. I am hopeful to be able to purchasemore from him soon.Rob Russell
1,Sad replica of a classic,"I ordered this product to be able to play classic NES games on my MAC via an adapter. Not only did the product not work, but was not even an original product as stated it was. I was very disappointed. I attempted to contact the seller and they gave me nothing but run around. I waited months for a response with no resolve. It's been sitting on my desk for over 3 months now... doing nothing but collecting dust. If you want a better product that works... Looks elsewhere."
4,Great For General Public/English Beat Fans,"I bought this cd when it first came out, and it seems I'm the only one who did! I actually listened to the crap out of this disc because I was looking for anything new with the English Beat/General Public sound. I can listen to this disc straight through with a lot of pleasure. Your Problems, I Told You, Smashing Down Another Door, One Minute Closer are all cool tracks, with In Love With You the pop track on the disc thats sounding good also. Good for Beat/General Public fans!"
5,One of the best solo treble recordings,"This CD is a collection of consort songs from olden times, superbly sung by Connor Burrowes. It is the recording I like best of this boy singer, and among all boy singers Connor stands out for the perfection and cleanliness of his singing. It is highly recommended for for the above reasons, and also for being one of the few historically accurate recordings of this kind of music. These songs were mostly ""family music"", and in a 17th century English family a musical evening would more often than not find the boys singing and the older family members playing the instruments.When I come across some uninformed person who thinks that boys can't sing with as much maturity and perfection as adult singers, I use this recording to show that they can, and do!"
2,Burn this book (but scan it first),"This book is way out of date. The good thing about it is that we can read it and look back at how much things have changed since 1983 when it was published. Another good thing about it is that we can look back and see how much things stay the same. The same battles are happening today, but it does seem that, all in all, Cal's Moral Majority is more on the defensive now, whereas the so-called secular humanists seem to have gained ground in 20 years. Diximus."
5,Make it the First Baby Gift!,This is the first necessary gift to buy the new mother in my opinion. This is an easy reader. Read as you need. I utilized this book for all three of my children and I continue to pass it along to my expectant mother friends and now my grandchildren.
2,Good information but....,"this is such a wordy, boring book to read! The author goes on and on and on with every topic. If you really love to read and have lots of time on your hands and want to delve deeply into every single possible aspect of raising a baby then I suppose this book would would work for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a more practical reference book for the first two years I'd check out Gentle Baby Care by Elizabeth Pantley. It's concise and complete and not wordy at all."
2,Great for detailed baby care and development,"I used an earlier version of this book from infancy until about age two (my son is now in his twenties)! I have gifted about 30 sets of new parents with Your Baby and Child. I really appreciated the detailed, practical advice, especially at 3:00 am when you need that answer!"
1,This book is outdated ! Don't waste your time !,"The information in this book is from the fifties, dressed in a modern cover. Don't waste your time. There are far better baby books available !"
3,Leaves you wanting for more,"Dont be confused by the relatively low ranking, this book is good. The only trouble is that it only contains fragments of the greatest historians ever. Though this is what the editor set out to do, you will feel cheated by not having the whole story to read. If all you want is a glimpse at what made the ancient historians so special, this is the book for you. However, chances are that you will want the complete story as well, something this collection cant offer."
2,Short Shelf Life,"The color was good, the paint went on great. However, in my experience Ralph Lauren paints have a very short shelf life as compared to other brands (e.g. Behr. Despite being in tightly sealed cans the paint separated into a semi-solid rubbery mass and a thin almost clear liquid that could not be re-mixed. That means that if you use this paint brand you won't easily be able to do touch up painting with the leftovers and will instead have to match and buy new paint. With other brands, though some separate did occur, I've been able to stir the paint and re-use it for touch-ups years later."
4,fun game,star ocean 3 may not be the best game ever for the ps2. but it's still worth it. the games visuals is very good and the characters dialouges is not bad.
2,Balance issues kill it,"Star ocean till the end of time starts out as a great game. The combat is fluid and skill based and the story is pretty good. About halfway through the game a big event happens (wont spoil it) and basically the rest of the game is a grind. You will spend 10 hours just hoping to somehow beat the ""normal"" enemies in the field to gain levels. At this point in the game almost every enemy you ecounter is like a boss fight. This is a cheap way to lengthen a video game. It's in-exusable, lazy and it kills the game. The difficulty ramps up from 1 to 1000 in the course of 5 minutes. I managed to finish the game but damn if it didn't test my patience. Difficulty is fine, but this game takes it to a whole new level and you soon realize it's broken and unfair."
4,Nel and Clair are definately lesbians,"yup, you all know itAnyway, graphics were ok, not that great. I was sort of worried about the characters health, because they're all uber-anorexic. The story was pretty good, until you get to the BIG plot twist which is really really retarted.Gameplay: I liked the battle mode a lot, although the HP costs were a little excessive when you used a special move.A big problem was the game went from moderately easy, up until moonbase and then the difficulty level jumps a billion levels. Damn those Angel fairy things and their spinny green move of doom.The invent item thing is a little stupid. I mean, you dont do anything, and you can't tell what your inventing, or what you've already invented."
1,Very offensive,"***Spoiler warning!***At first, I thought this game rocked. The graphics were cool, the story was amazing, the battles are good. But then,as the game continued, I started to notice one thing: this game has some allusions that would be offensive to anyone who believes in God.The main conflict of the game centers around an armageddon-like event, where the creator of the universe decides to annihilate everyone because ""we"" (people in Star Ocean universe) had delved into forbidden science. Now, here's the part where I find offensive:Your ultimate goal in this game is to defeat the Creator of the universe, i.e, the one civilizations in this universe would call God. One of the enemies you will face in this game is the angel Gabriel. Need I say more?Maybe I'm being overtly sensitive... but to me, the idea of killing God is something I would not even want to entertain.If you believe in God, and are considering purchasing this game for yourself or your kids, don't."
3,good game but...,this overall was a great game but with the constantly the same keys and holding times this game got old fast.and the finial boss i think they could have made his a little harder with all that health and so much power. if you are thinking of buying this game i recomemd that you buy the book because there is alot stuff the do and you will not find it by yourself.
5,Night of the Cotillion,"Janet Dailey, as always did a great job in exposing the estacy of attraction. I found and read only the middle half of that book when I was sixteen years old, and was so captivated and hooked that I have been looking for that book ever since. Now in my forties I still can't get that book out of my thoughts. I Janet Dailey is a woman whom I feel is or has been in love and understands the beautiful and compelling feeling that God intended to be experienced between a man and a woman. It is a beautiful book."
5,Truly Enlightening,"If you're a student, beware of this book. It will cause you to lose sleep and forget to do your homework as you are guided through an exciting tour of life in the 21st century. This book is full of exciting themes and new ideas as to where computers, DNA, and Quantum Physics will take us in the 21st century. The book is nicely diveded into several sections, each about 2 to 3 pages long, that offer a detailed look at some aspect of each revolution. I have been up late many nights because I would read the heading to the next section, and then read the section to see what he says. Headings like 'Will computers be able to feel?' compel you to read furthur. Then the cycle repeats and it becomes very difficult to put this book down."
5,Great Book,"If you're interested in scientific research and where it may very well take us, then this is a good read. Pick it up today."
1,Mediocre-- not really earthshaking,"I found the book mildly disappointing-- there are several better books predicting the future. Arthur C. Clarke's _Profiles of the Future_ remains number one, and Robert Forward's _Future Magic_ and Dean Ing and Leik Myrabo's _Future Flight_ are also recommended."
3,Difficult,"Just a warning to listeners coming to this album because of Vannier's association with Gainsbourg (which is probably most people). The music on this doesn't resemble the music on Histoire de Melody Nelson in the slightest, save for some of the choral arrangements. There's none of the funky spaciousness that characterises Gainsbourg's classic album and it's also entirely instrumental which means that it comes off almost as some kind of film score.....from a very bizarre, avant-garde film.What I'm trying to say is that this album is a pretty difficult listen and offers few rewards for the casual listener. Make sure you listen to some of it before you make the purchase."
5,Best buy,"This slicer lives up to its' reviews. Easy to use, easy to clean. I use this daily in place of 2 other mandoline slicers that are not as user friendly"
4,Realistic expectations will be met...,"The French Laundry Cookbook says this is what they use. I'm a banquet cook and this is what we use. They are a great buy and will fit in a roomy knife case. Those little safety handles don't work on any of the plastic mandolines from any maker, and we have a classic expensive stainless steel mandoline that NO ONE at work is willing to use, because it doesn't have a safety handle either, but grave bodily damage promises to be far greater in severity. There is a Shun mandoline (retail 500$) that actually has a handle connected to a sliding rail that looks like it will work in theory, but Cook's Illustrated rated it at the bottom. Watch your fingers, hold veggies with a towel and use the leftover scrap for a stockpot instead of trying to get the last chip from a potato or shred from a carrot."
5,"Love it, but be careful with those fingers!","I love using this mandoline, as I recall my mother using it. It is VERY sharp and does the job, but please be careful with those fingers. Recommended."
3,make sure you know what you're getting,"I bought the Benriner Japanese Mandoline Slicer about 2 weeks ago and returned it for two reasons. The first being I didn't research the dimensions enough and therefore didn't realize how small the slicer is. It will not slice potatoes, onions, or other large items. Also, the slicer is a mint green color with lime green knobs on the side. From the picture it looks white to me, so that was a surprise. I like using pretty things in the kitchen and this is certainly not that. As long as you're aware of those two things, I'm sure it's a great slicer. Just make sure you like it as once I returned the item I found out that the seller has a 25% charge for restocking... with that and the return shipping cost I'm out more than $10. Just wanted to make sure others don't make the same mistake."
2,Nice idea but do they research about this before actually made?,"I found it below difficulty while I am using it in a short period time.1. There are hard to use holder with hard vegetable such as carrot-it suppose to be hold tightly any of vegetable but it is not.2. It is too narrow (even compare than any other mandolin) to slice almost any vegetable or fruit.3. I only used it a week but I think dial (hold a blade tightly) is too soft. So, I think it can't be last long. Also, it is too small and hard to make tightness or release it."
5,I have 3,"The Beriner is not the perfect mandoline but it is more useful, for more tasks than the large french mandoline I also have. It is light, easily transportable and used in more professional kitchen stations than the larger metal version.You can throw out the finger guard the moment you get it. Like any other tool it requires care. A dish towel is a better finger guard as you get to the bitter end of a carrot or a zuchini.The one drawback is that it does not cut thicker than about an 1/8 inch. You could not push a celery root through it or even a tough carrot the long way(you can, but it requires poise) still it is only 30 bucks and it lasts forever. Outside of dense root vegetables, it's great. One of my favortie tools, along with my vita prep, cryovac machine and immersion circulator."
1,Sausages have come to take over,"I am frankly disgusted after listening to this CD. Wendy makes blonde women out to be thick and she enhances the stereotypical blonde image. Wendy should have brown hair because this would not enhance a stereotypical image. All of the characters in the show are fair skinned, this is again portraying a politically incorrect image to young children. Including the tractor, why is is yellow? It should be red. The music is loud and not suitablr for the generation it is aimed at. With names for the songs such as 'The right tool for the job' and 'No one can dig it like we can' the Cd is shown to be more of a Britne Spears album than a young childs complimatio"
5,wonderful for a high school or college book report,"i ejoy reading ANNI ADAMS` for my senior high year book report meeting of anni adams` the buterfly of luxembourg. ANNI ADAMS` ADAMS` A SPEICAL WOMEN. JUST LOOK WHAT THE FAITH CAN DO . GOD BLESS LONNIE STORY FOR WRITING THIS HEART WARNING STORY,"
5,works like a charm,"When I bought this product the strainer came broken...so I figured a little epoxy and i'll be on my way..that didn't hold, so i decided to call the company directly ITT RULE...they sent me one right away via UPS, they paid the shipping..no questions asked...As for the merchant from Amazon.com....fast, relaible..no problems...I choose not to bother with the broken part via Amazon, because I was not prepared to hear that it came from a third party..and then...and then...either way great pump...get a 1 1/2 inch hull fittingand hose for this badboy."
5,Very strong pump...,This is about as large a 12V pump as you will ever need! Requires extra large hose for the exit but it's a very good pump.
5,Don't be fooled by cover or title,"Being a guy I was real reluctant to watch this movie by looking at the cover. Tina Fey sort of gets on my nerves when she does the SNL Weekend update (I guess it would be different if norm mcdonald was there with her.) And the blond haired girl is just not funny to me. But this movie is as funny as anything that has come out this year*. It has great characters,including Steve Martin, and a well written screenplay with clever and hilarious jokes around every corner. Trust me, your girl will want to rent it, but you will be the one who agrees with me at the end. Lorne Michaels produced it, it's funny. *Also rent Forgetting Sarah Marshall"
2,Such a shame ...,"It's already been said that the script was weak for this film. I concur. I believe Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, if not the best female comedians ever produced by SNL, they are most certainly among the top 4 or 5. That's why it's such a shame they didn't have a great script to help make this a great comedy. Sometimes mediocre acting can be elevated by a good script, but seldom can a poor script be saved by the actors, however good they may be.Tina Fey should never agree to take on another comedic role without serious control of the script - she's too good a writer to risk her career to a bummer like this one. And she and Poehler have such wonderful chemistry & splendid timing together, it's just a shame this movie wasn't what it might have been."
2,Starts out well and then insults us,"This film starts out well enough with the two very talented leads but then slips into one cliche after another about half way through the film. The ""happy ending"" is so unlikely (the film actually says that the chance of it happening is a million to one)that it is a slap in the face to anyone who bought into the initial premise of the film. Rather than try to develop an interesting ending that doesn't insult our intelligence, the scriptwriter decided to quickly tie things up with cliches and sugary Oprah-style nonsense. This ruined the film for me. Don't start a film by telling me that something is impossible and then end it by doing the impossible. Bleeaaahh!"
5,gooooood,"Love the movie! I wish Amazon would ship before the release date so it would have arrived right on the day it came out. I think they shipped on the release date itself, so we got it like 4 days later."
2,Its ok,I was expecting to laugh a lot more but unfortunately this movie was that funny. Had its moments but over all i am disappointed.
2,Not even 1/2 as good as commercials suggested!,"I remember seeing the commercial for this movie and saying ""I Have to see that"". I finally got around to renting it and I was sooooooooo disappointed! These 2 women were so funny on SNL that I was expecting belly laugh after belly laugh. WRONG! The writers/directors should have taken advantage of the comedy duo and made the movie a real 'pee in your pants' flick. I waited and waited for the jokes but they rarely came. Go rent ""The Hangover"" if you want a GREAT comedy."
2,"This movie is just ""okay""","This movie is kind of stupid, but teenagers might like it. There were some good parts and some good actors, but I don't want to watch it a second time. It wasn't terrible where I wanted to turn off the tv, just okay. Here is another movie I would rent before purchasing."
4,Not Bad,"Baby MamaI gave this an extra star for the ""Ladies of Saturday Night"". We should see much more of their comedic talents in more movies. The ""Men of Saturday Night"" have ruled the movies for decades and since Gilda Radner and Jane Curtin I have not seen a funnier pair. Tina Fey is sexy and Amy Poehler, well what can I say the woman knows comedy. I thought that this movie could have been funnier. It has it's moments a few good laughs but something is missing. However if you have been a fan of Saturday Night Live for decades like me I think you will enjoy this one. No belly laughs like you expect from Will Ferrell but fans will like seeing the ladies in this movie. I recomend this one."
2,Forced And Not Funny...,"Movies that are billed as comedies should not have numerous, terrible pauses while waiting for a laugh-track that isn't coming. Fey deserved a better script to showcase her talent. Not sure how Kinear got mixed up in this flop. Steve Martin, well, Steve Martin is the ONLY reason to watch this movie. His over-the-top enviro-guy was hysterical. The rest of this movie crashed and burned. It was a good concept lost in a bad script with choppy editing and non-funny jokes. Avoid!"
3,Could have been better,"Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are two funny ladies, and I honestly feel that they make a great team, but this movie was not the best place to showcase that effort. The writing felt cliched at times, and the story itself just did not... click. Tina and Amy are funny, but a different story would have suited them better."
2,Don't Expect 30 Rock,"PLOTA 30-something executive grows more and more desperate to have a baby. She eventually opts for the surrogate mother option, a choice that brings with it many light-hearted complications.REVIEWThis is a broadly amusing comedy. The script is reasonably witty. The chemistry between the executive (Tina Fey) and the surrogate (Amy Poehler) is the main attraction here. Talented actors Sigourney Weaver, Greg Kinnear and Romany Malco are unfortunately wasted in unengaging supporting roles. An unbilled Steve Martin, however, does crack a smile here and there as Fey's lunatic boss.If you're a fan of the TV show ""30 Rock"", don't get excited. Fey, one of today's most talented comedy writers, did not write or produce ""Baby Mama"".I would recommend buying this DVD only if it fell below the US$7.00 mark. Perhaps then it can wait for a rainy day when you're in an undemanding mood and feel like a light comedy. And there's certainly no need to buy it on blu-ray."
2,"Help me, God...No...The Horror!","My goodness, who would in his right mind will go out and buy a NES copy of Championship Bowling for fifty bucks back then? Surely, not me. I got this for free, and I dreaded the idea of turning the game on and trying it out. Wow, the actual game play...I just want to drop a 20 pounder on my head. After fifteen minutes of lameness into Championship Bowling, I was able to get 7 strikes and 5 spares for a score of 235. The sheer...joy...of the game...*cries*....I am sprouting follicles all over...my body! They are turning...green! No..no...no...it is the end...of the...world for...me! Clutching to my...beaten...up...copy of...Championship Bowling.....save me! Please...save me! Jesus...no..........."
5,great for small arms,"I've had trouble finding an armband that fit and this one is comfortable and doesn't slide around. Because there are 2 ways to tighten, this armband is great for small arms. LOVE it!!"
5,It's a cap!,I works just a like a cap! I wouldn't expect it to act any other way... I would buy it again if I needed too
3,Pleasantly surprised,"I liked this cd very much, it's not like his other albums, but I enjoyed it very much"
3,Review of Continuum by Mayer,"Picked up this CD after really enjoying Mayers ""Battle Studies"" This one didn't do it for me at all. The style was very different and it wasn't for me."
3,I Like It Fine.,This cd is easy on the ears and mind with some interesting lyrics and guitar chops . I'm gonna listen to it again right now. I like what the boy is up to.
4,Mayer/Continuum,Great sound and some masterful songwriting. Lyrics are compelling. Slow dancing in a burning room! What a visual.
5,His best yet,"I love all of John Mayer's stuff, but his style has filled out and matured on this last album. He plays with all his heart and his band complements him really well."
5,Masterpiece,I just wanted to physically have this cd even though I had every song in my itunes. Every song is amazing on this album and is really one of John's masterpiece.
5,SUPERSTAR IN THE MAKING,John Mayer just goes from strength to strength. Another incredibly well crafted Album from him. His vocal style combined with his excellent guitar work makes for very easy listening indeed.
5,Smashing,"John has continued (no pun intended) his journey into the hearts of his fans. I expected no less from him as I have watched him mature with his art of music. He ""continues"" to strive to perfection! What a perfect name for this album. Loved it from the start!"
4,"Easy on the ears, but a little too much of the same.","The mix was nice, but after the 5th song, I was ready for a different pace in sound. I think it had too much of the same tone throughout and it got a little tiring."
3,Not as good as the first 2 records...,"I bought this disk for two reasons: 1. I'm a fan of the first two Mayer records 2. The reviews for Continuum have been great, however after several spins, I find Continuum to be good, but certainly not great. There aren't more than a few songs that actually stand out, worth buying, but not worth the 4-5 star rating."
1,continuum by J ohn Mayer,Very disappionted. waste of money. Liked his songs before but this album was not upto par.
3,I'm disappointed so far,"I loved both Room for Squares and Heavier Things, but am disappointed by Continuum. I bought the whole album on itunes the day it was released. I've listened to it now three times, and besides ""Waiting for the World to Change"" -- nothing has stuck. Frankly, most of the songs sound the same to me.This was quite the opposite experience with the first two -- especially Room for Squares. That album hit me like a ton of bricks. One song was better than the next. Not so, or at least not yet, for Continuum.I will keep listening, but am starting to doubt my expenditure of precious itunes $$ for the whole album. I think I should have picked and chosen a few songs instead of going whole hog."
4,Worth the wait,"It seems like Mayer takes forever to put new stuff out. I waited a long time for Heavier Things - and that one took a LONG time to get used to. Continuum was a long wait as well, but this album is far more rewarding than his previous work. Basically, Continuum is a mild, easy-going album - no real rock numbers, save for the Hendrix cover Bold as Love. I think this album shows Mayer's progression as a musician. It's easy to hear the influence of John Mayer Trio on this album, which is great. I was never the biggest fan of his early stuff, and I thought Heavier Things was heading in the right direction, but Continuum seems to be the style of music I was hoping for from Mayer. I suppose your opinion of Continuum will depend on whether you want the old John Mayer back or if you're willing to go with this new stuff. Personally, I'm digging the new stuff. 4/5 stars."
4,A classic vegetarian cookbook,"Both this book and the original Moosewood cookbook are great primers on vegetarian cooking. They offer staple recipes and techniques that can be used as is or adapted to your own tastes. These are books that truly teach you how to cook, not just give you recipes. This style of cooking is very definitely health food, so if you're used to highly processed food with a lot of sodium it can take some getting used to and might seem flavorless, at first."
2,Recipies not good,"Sorry to say but the recipies in this book are yukky! I don't know what Mollie was thinking, she however is not the good cook people think she is.You will be much better off sticking with the Moosewood cookbooks...every single one is truly wonderful. And the other reviewer was right, what's so special about the title recipie...nothing. Don't waste your money, I threw my copy out!"
3,If you like classical music...,".. you will like this DVD for your children. Imagine a decent quality home video of you at the zoo put to classical music in the background. It is not bad, but it isn't the highest quality and does not include a lot of talking or information. My 3 year old likes it though!"
5,Memory Lane,"This album was purchased to replace one that I grew up with and was lost over the years. I can still hear my dad singing some of the songs, wrong words and all."
3,More like a travel program than an undersea program,"From the title, I'd expected more focus on the undersea environment and undersea life, but this dvd is aimed at divers who are planning a trip, and want to see what the Great Barrier and Queensland have to offer. It has great scenes of divers interacting with the fish and of the reefs. It does quite a good job of showing off the Great Barrier's wonderful natural beauty. This dvd is not for people interested in learning about the wildlife in the Great Barrier, more for travelers. It also shows only a few of the dive sites in the Great Barrier and Queensland, and also shows inland wildlife, and advertises a hotel, which is not really appropriate for a dvd of this title. This is a good travel brochure, but is certainly not a nature/wildlife dvd."
5,A masterpiece of research and the writing craft,"Rhodes' masterpiece brilliantly synthesizes various genres: a lucid and well-documented history, a layperson's primer on atomic physics, and a study of human nature as insightful as the best fiction. He won the Pulitzer and deserves a Nobel."
3,The Making of a Detailed History,This a remarkable book. Very well written and covers just about everything you want to know about the making of the atomic bomb. I would be happy with a book of half the length and detail. There was simply too much for me to absorb.
5,One of the important books of the 20th Century,"""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" by Richard Rhodes is one of the most important books of the 20th Century, and comparable as non-fiction to ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by William L. Shirer.The ultimate understanding of the early 20th Century, that Chemistry was ultimately an Electrical phenomenon, gave rise to a profound understanding of physical matter.The three broad criteria of science at the time were:(a) PLAUSIBILITY(b) SCIENTIFIC VALUE(c) ORIGINALITYThe book details the research of Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr into a question ""old as Aristotle"" which was that of VITALISM versus MECHANISM. It involved anongoing debate between philosophical and religious assumptives as to whether or not the Universe exhibited a ""purpose"" (the question of Teleology), or whether or not the Universeoperates according to mere Chance and automatic function. [The debate still rages, by the way.]"
4,The making of the atomic bomb,"I'm only half way through the book. However, it is making all the physicist that I read about in my science courses come alive. It is a great read."
5,THE definitive book on the subject,"Rhoads meticulously covers all roads travelled in the development of the atomic bomb. It's a long book, it can be technical at times, but it is beautifully researched and written. However, I wouldn't recommend it to someone casually interested in the subject."
2,"Only works for powerpoint, only sends pageUp/pageDown, not configurable","This pointer works, but only for PowerPoint. I naively assumed that if you could use it to go back/forward on PowerPoint, you could also use it for a iPhoto slideshow or some other application. Not so. You can't set it up to do anything other than send pageUp/pageDown, and alt-tab."
2,Missing Features!,"This presenter will advance and go back in a powerpoint presentation, but it will NOT allow you to move the curser and click on a hot link or button on a powerpoint slide."
1,Clicker,"The buttons make a very loud clicking sound when pressed, quite distracting. Laser is weak. It does move the presentation foward and backward.Spend a few more dollars and get a better presenter."
3,"Nice, but not what I orderd","I just received this, havent tried it yet. but its not the same as the picture advertised. it is also missing a pouch to hold it in."
3,Not a mouse,"It works great for PPT presentations, but I purchased this thinking it was a mouse too and that I could use it to operate my screen/computer while I am teaching class. Previously, I had a similar one that would operate the PPT's and it was a wireless mouse. I could switch back and forth between screens, scroll web pages up and down all while teaching my class. For this reason, am I a bit disappointed. It is very small and compact, which is a plus. It does offer the black screen, which I do like. Also, the storage unit for the USB is very neat, compact, and great for portability. The laser is sufficient for my class, but not so bright and the diameter of the laser is not very large. It will work for now, but I am still in search of a laser presenter, wireless mouse, and laser - all in one."
1,Targus remote presenter= worst product ever,"I ordered this from Amazon. It didn't work at all- figured I got a defective one and returned it for a replacement. The second one was so cheaply made ($26)that the battery cover wouldn't even open. Once I finally was able to open it, it wouldn't slide closed. This one seemed like it was loading software to my PC but again, nothing happened. I am terribly disappointed as I have had these before, they never last more than a year but this was and continues to be a total waste of my time. I had to return the second one and still don't have a wireless presenter!"
3,NOT WHAT YOU SEE,"As others have indicated, the product you get when you order here is NOT what you see in the images. It's a smaller presenter with smaller buttons that are laid out strangely and that are REALLY loud (like one of those metal ""clickers"").I would not recommend it - look at the Kensington presenter if you want something easy to learn and use or the Logitech one if you crave lots of additional features."
3,My Experience,"Here are my comments:I found the 321 easy to install but not so easy to operate. Poor instructions and not intuitive. The FAQs on the CD totally missed how to operate. Documentation on the CD is limited and sometimes confusing.The 321, unlike more expensive models, needs a PC with a reasonably modern operating system. Skype must be running, at least to see contacts. I haven't tried originating a Skype call without having Skype running on the PC, but I would guess that it wouldn't work. It isn't all that inconvenient to leave the PC running with Skype running.Making a Skype call that isn't in the contact list isn't as obvious as it could be. I've looked at the CD and the instructions in the box and the post about how easy it is... nothing works. It looks like the 321 was rushed to market with little investment made in make sure it was easy to operate. If/when I understand this phone, I'll do another post."
1,Drivers can't keep up with Skype upgrades,"I purchased this phone in summer of 2008 to take advantage of Skype and VOIP while working with people all around the world, unfortunately shortly after I installed the phone, Skype upgraded their software and since then Phillips hasn't done a thing to make their drivers work with the latest versions of Skype, so I have to use my webcam microphone and speakers to do calls. Also doesn't allow me to use the landline option for POTS calls.would not recommend you buy this phone if you intend to use w. Skype. I'll probably have to junk mine since it doesn't have any functionality without working w. Skype."
1,Do not buy if you are running Vista,This product is supposed to be Vista compatiable; it is not. Philips has recently changed their website to say they are evaluating the products compatiability.
5,good phone,"this phone has a basic behaviours but is acording with the price, so I'm so happy with it beacuse it made was it says that it made"
3,disturbance,"I have only tried using this phone as a landline. The interference is awful. I am wondering why i am having interference, any ideas? I have another cordless phone that has excellant sound quality. I had this same trouble with another cordless phone. I don't think it is the phone, itself. Any help plz"
1,Phone is great if you're a software engineer,"All of the other gripes aside, I only have ONE.Philips refuses to support the driver.New versions of Skype cause the phone driver to hang.Which means that it will stop working in a couple weeks.Don't waste your time or your money."
1,LIARS,"I paid to get my book with expedited shipping but after I personally contacted this seller (BBanx) he said he thinks he sent it last Friday. I asked him the actual date he sent it knowing that ""think"" usually means ""I'm lying"" He said he would do it the next day... THREE WEEKS AFTER HE SHOULD HAVE SHIPPED IT... I think people should know that textbooks aren't something he can keep lying around because students have deadlines. DO NOT BUY THIS MAN'S BOOK IT'S TOO MUCH OF A RISK"
1,Beware,"Beware that even though this item is described as a T-Cell-15 and your invoice will say T-Cell-15, you will be getting a GLX-Cell-15-W. The difference is that the GLX-Cell-15-W has only a 1 year warranty as compared to the T-Cell-15 which has a 3 year warranty. This description is therefore a FRAUD!"
1,T-Cell-15,"The product displayed was not the product received. Also, since the product displayed was incorrect, the price for the T-Cell 15 displayed was incorrect. The price was actually for the T-Cell-3 and this is what was received, but not what was ordered or needed. As a result, I had to go through the hassle of calling, explaining this situation, waiting for the correct T-Cell and returning the T-Cell 3.""In the Swim"" was very understanding through this process and very cooperative."
5,great game,this game is one of the greatest games on the nes. i currently own ps2 and am intrigues that they will be bringing back ff1 and 2. they should remake this classic as well.
2,Cushions,These cushions turned out to be quite big and they are not very comfortable to walk with. They're also not adhesive so you'll have to come up with a way to make them stay in place. The positive part about them that they're gel and not so visible as for example leather ones. But I wouldn't buy them again.
4,Good,"This is a full out medical study on impotence and is carried out professionally and with great scientific accuracy. You can always count on the results of this thesis because it is one of the best ever, with information concerning all aspects of impotence, except treatment. If you are a man in pain and seek relief from impotence this thesis is only for information, for information AND treatment read ""Natural Penis Enlargement: New Methods of Avoiding and Curing Impotence, Premature Ejaculation, and Erectile Dysfunction Safely and Inexpensively. New ... No Pumps, No Pills and No Gadgets! Vol. 2"" by Platinum Millennium, a great unique book for all sexual disorders"
2,Miles is a hack writer,"The idea of boldly changing continuity doesn't bother me, provided it is written well. Interference is a gigantic mess. The novel starts off strong, but quickly loses steam as each character becomes a mouthpiece for Miles' political and sociological pontifications. With his experimental style, Miles clealy thinks he is Doctor Who's version of James Joyce. Unfortunately, he does not have the talent to pull it off. A great disappointment. I'm sure there are some wonderful Doctor Who books out there, but I seem to keep reading the wrong ones."
4,The more things change.........,"The more things change, the more they stay the same. With Enron,Worldcom, and other companies going down in flames all around us-with the little guys getting the shaft, while the CEO's get gold-en parachutes-when you read this, you realize nothing has changedin 2,000 years!!!!!!!!!!!!Allowing for some Roman idioms, Sallust is as relevant today as he was 2,000 years ago.Pretty sad commentary on human nature, huh?!"
2,Flawed book for administrators,"This is book is definitely intended for administrators. Witness about the 30 pages on how to use a wiki. How to install: 36 pages. Structuring the content, hacking the code and understanding what you find: 140 pages. Administration tools: 55 pages. There are some examples of wiki use in education and business. The included CD has mangled code. Even after writing a perl program to convert, it looked like it was at least trying to work but wasn't."
5,Good book if you like mathematics!,This is the best book about General relativity ( GR ) that I have ever read. Instead of trying to explain GR with words the author is using mathematics to to illustrate some of the consequences of GR. This means that some mathematical knowledge is required ( but not knowledge about tensors and dfferential forms ) and that the reader need to spend some time with paper and pencil to truly understand the text. The examples is concentrated on what is happening around black holes but the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the slowing of light around the Sun is also described. A very good book!
5,Great lawnmower,"This lawnmower so far works great. I've had it for about 2 months now. Very easy to start, and doesn't cop out when I am cutting slightly thick/long grass. I couldn't beat the price compared to other lawnmowers locally as well as online."
1,hard to stay interested,"Maybe it's a mom thing. I am not a mom. I just didn't get it. I was expecting something more along the lines of ""the Nanny Diaries"" but this book is from a mother's perspective (2 moms in fact) and it lacks interest. It is all written in letter/email form and very hard to follow at first. It is not a difficult read, but it leaves you wondering why you wasted the time!"
5,funny,"My 8 year old boy and I loved it... We laughed through the whole thing, he loved the slapped. Stick comedy and now we watch the originals together."
4,Modern day Stooges,"Some good comedy here but let's be very clear that it is not as funny as the original comedies. The idea to update the Stooges to modern day situations has been kicking around for spme years now. It's a long overdue idea but the execution is uneven at times.Of the 3 leads, Hayes as Larry probably does the best with his role and this is a pleasant surprise. The other 2 leads are fairly good but not excellent. A really good supporting cast adds to the movie's charms. Very enjoyable but just not as good as it could have been. Maybe a better script and actors with the great talent and range to play Moe and Curly would have been better but as is, it is still fun and humorous. A great idea but only good execution."
5,Great,This order arrived so quickly. I had looked everywhere and could not find it locally. I am going to start buying everything online !
3,"I second ""It's okay""","The actors do a great job imitating the originals. The story about their lives from childhood kinda didn't fit with my well grooved memories of the real wiseguys. Kids however, would probably really enjoy."
5,The Three Stooges: The Movie,"I must admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching this movie, I was afraid that it would take the route of the last few years that included Joe DeRita and Joe Besser, but as a lifelong 3 Stooges fan in his 60's I took a chance to purchase the DVD. It was , without a doubt , a great tribute to Larry, Moe and Curly , the greatest comedy team of all-time. Thanks for bringing back a terrific group of guys who obviously loved the Stooges as well. Put these guys back into a sequel and this time I will not hesitate to purchase the DVD, you guys made my day...........Bill King"
5,nyk nyk nyk,"the best stooger movie in 30 years made me laugh out loud, at some points the abuse would not end for some of the people they were trying to help"
1,Not funny,"Longtime Stooges fan. Nice try, but misses the mark. The black and white comedy of the Stooges doesn't work in color and modern times. This has no heart.Just my opinion, if you liked it then give it a positive review. No need to name call."
1,Movie was great. Kids love the movie. The streaming from Amazon was poor.,Our kids love this moving however the streaming from Amazon was a big disappointment. We steam from NetFlix all of the time without issue however the streaming from Amazon paused on more than one occasion and was very choppy.
2,Whatever,"They tried. The great originals are so available to all that this seems like it was just a boondogle. I think they meant well but why? Oh yeah, money."
4,Slapstick Funny!,This was a modern day version of The Three Stooges...loved the slapstick humor true to the original! It was presented in segments like the television version...total escape humor!
4,Very funny!!!,I loved this movie!! I was giggling and laughing throughout the movie! Bought back memories of when I was a kid. Classic comical trio!!
3,Average Rating - Parent & Kid,"I would give this movie one star, my 9-year-old son gives it 5 stars. So the 3 is an average rating. Most of the funny parts are shown in the trailer (in my opinion)."
4,For old 3 stooges fans,"My kids liked it but not to the extent that I did when I was their age. Different expectations nowadays, I suppose."
4,Three Stooges,"I was probably the only one laughing when I first saw the trailer. It's no thought required comedy, where you can sit down and forget your problems and just laugh. I thought the actors did a good job acting like the stooges but I will admit the sappy moments could have been cut out. Can we have one comedy film without a sappy moment added in? I did get a little mad seeing Jersey Shore but seeing Moe beat them up made me happy. Is it bad? I've been a life long Stooge fan and no one can replace the original stooges but this is a good tribute to the boys. Very funny but does have a few moments where it drags a bit. If you're a lover of comedy then I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it. Unless you're one of those close minded people who sticks to originals and refuse to open your mind to remakes."
4,"Stupid, but oh so funny","The actors do an amazing job of channeling Larry, Curly and Moe. The plot is typical Three Stooges, but the sight gags had me laughing out loud. If you are a fan of the Three Stooges, you won't be disappointed with this movie."
4,"Goofy, but fun",This movie was silly and kind of cheesy but still fun. Our whole family watched it together and it had all of us laughing.
4,good fun time movie,good fun time movie for those who remember the original B&W three stooges movies on Saturday afternoons nicely done good safety commentary at the end of the movie for those kids who just don't quite seem to get it
4,IT'S A FUN HOMAGE TO THE CLASSIC CLOWNS,"I grew up watching the 3 Stooges every day on the old WTTG station out of Washington DC. I loved them and their unique slapstick. No one can ever replace the original Curly, Moe and Larry, so I approached the Farrally brothers new film with some trepidation. Happily, the movie is quite fun and recreates the shenanigans quite faithfully. Chris Diaminotopolous is quite good as Moe--it's almost spooky how much he embodies the mop-headed meanie. Will Sasso's Curly and Sean Hayes' Larry are also sincere interpretations. The sight gags are executed in the most complimentary fashion and the plot is merely a roadmap for the Stooges hijinks. The supporting players are fun, especially Sofia Vergara, Larry David and Craig Bierko. The inclusion of the Jersey Shore crew is really great, seeing that pretentious bunch get whacked around by Moe."
2,Poor Quality,"I'm a strong believer, so I give this movie two stars for getting the main point right - that people are often mad at God and unable to see the rottenness in their own hearts. Also I liked how the movie addressed how often Satan isn't even seen as real.But I couldn't give it more stars as it seemed disjointed and the acting was horrible and the writing even worse. I'm sure everyone who worked on this project put in a ton of effort but it's one of those movies that makes Christians look pitiful, really, that we don't know how to relate to people where they are really at. In my opinion it only scraped the surface of peoples' real struggles in experiencing evil on our planet, so came off as superficial and, well, unintelligent and, patronizing - which is what much of the world expects from us. I know these are harsh words but sometimes I think movies/projects like this can do more harm than good - solidifying the stereotype non-Christians can have of us and our message."
5,Warning: This movie exposes the true nature of the devil.,This is a great movie directed by Tim Chey to expose the devil and his schemes. We all face a spiritual battle everyday and this movie does a great job showing that and what better way then having someone sue the devil in court. This movie has Christian cult classic written all over it and I think Malcolm McDowell plays the perfect devil. It's entertaining and has funny moments and some very touching and moving moments. Best of all the gospel and the truth of the gospel will be seen and heard. I recommend this movie to ALL.
1,Painfully hard to watch,"Have to admit, I was really looking forward to seeing this film because I thought the premise was completely original. About 10 minutes into it, I began to get frustrated with how amateurish the writing and the acting was. It went downhill from there and fast. There are a couple of moments that begin to mine the potential the film has, namely every moment Malcolm McDowell is testifying on the stand as Satan. Outside of that, every time you see the defense attorney characters on screen and every second of the legal talk show in the film, you'll think you're watching a Mystery Science Theater episode, that degree of campy art. Great concept, some memorable moments, McDowell is fun to watch, poor execution overall."
3,"Ordered Smoked Paprika, received a cheaper item instead","I was excited to give this smoked paprika a try, but I was sent Chiquilin Hot Paprika instead (a much cheaper item). The can of hot paprika had a sticker attached with a bar-code, and the sticker indicated it was for smoked paprika. So I'm guessing that there are more mislabeled cans in stock. I'll be happy to update my review and rating when and if I get the right product... but for now I wouldn't order this if I were you.1/30/13 - Update - Amazon customer service refunded my money. I'll change the rating to 3 stars."
4,Great !!!!!!!!!!,"Ordered this item would have given it 5 stars but there was a bunch of clumps in it dumped it out into a shaker. But flavor wise its the best,it adds just the right amount of smokeiness with out being over powering."
4,Great flavor - but would like to have a sprinkler top,"This tastes much better than any of the normal stuff you buy in a local grocery store. I like to sprinkle this on steamed veggies.I has to dump the paprika from another bottle to make room for this stuff. The can is kind of nice, but I would have preferred something that lets you sprinkle onto food."
3,I love this book,I am Oishin. I am 14 years old and i have AS. Email Me. I found out about my problem. It is great to find out.
5,Another Marvelous Story,"Nevil Shute is one of the most wondrous storytellers I've ever read. He uses such simple premises, he gives you details you'd never think of, his books are peopled with ordinary people who do extraordinary things. This book begins at the end of WWII and continues through the early 50's. A Leading Wren who loses everyone she loves. A man who searches for her in vain only to find her in a most unusual place when it's too late. Shute uses a most unusual style in telling this story, but he manages to still keep it straightforward and entertaining. What a great read!"
1,WAY smaller than described...,"it says 15inx7in, but from the tip of the hook to the last piece of wood it is only 11inches and its widest point is only 5in...I don't know if they sent me the wrong size or what, but I'm not ordering this item again."
2,"bubbles in decal, and plastic not very shiny kind of dull.","I like the fact it is a glass headlight because the plastic ones get dull overtime, but the plastic is not very shinny and the decal had bubbles in it. Overall, it looked kind of funky on my xl500r honda."
2,Thread was loose,Gave this item as a gift and there was a thread loose and item was unravelling. My sister had to sew it.
1,Don't bother,While the filtered water from the Pur system tastes great it just isn't worth the hassle. After trying both vertical and horizontal styles I have given up on Pur. I have been through 5 of them and none has lasted through more than 3 filters. The unit will start leaking and spraying all over the kitchen and since it is entirely plastic there is no way to repair them. I personally have had good luck with contacting Pur. Twice they replaced the unit at no cost but the replacements broke within a couple of months. But replacing shouldn't be the answer. I don't know what to buy next as every other brand seems to have similar problems. And the companies don't seem to be trying to find a solution to the defects.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I WAS DOING DISHES WITH MY 3400B FILTER IN THE ""OFF"" POSITION WHEN IT SUDDENLY ""EXPLODED"" OFF OF THE FAUCET INTO THE SINK - - I WAS LUCKY THAT IT DIDN'T SMASH THE GLASSES I WAS WASHING AT THE TIME!!! I TRIED TO PUT IT BACK ON, BUT IT WOULD NOT STAY, THE LEAST LITTLE FLOW OF UNFILTERED WATER CAUSING IT TO POP OFF. (AND THE FILTER ALWAYS FILLED UP QUICKLY, TOO, CAUSING THE ""GOOD"" WATER STREAM TO BECOME A TRICKLE WITHIN DAYS OF REPLACING IT). DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Quality?????????,"This is one of many PUR water filters I have purchased. All previous designs hase leaked around filter indicater housing.P&G; have given me credit for two new ones, that self destruct. After the newer design almost exploded in kitchen I calledP&G; customer relations. Said my unit was two years old. Told warranty good for one year. Best the P&G; would do was 25% offplus S&H.; Looked on Amazon and price was about the same. Replaced wth Amazon unit since I had several filters left.Filter housing is from China, very thin and under high pressure can crack. The filter itself, from Mexico does a very good jobfor it's purpose.Would not recommend purchasing a new unit with the unexceptable rates of failure, or messes resulting from a failure."
1,"Decent filtering, bad design.","I have pretty bad water here, bad smell and taste. This filtration system would be pretty good, it does a decent job of taking away the bad smell and taste. That said, 2 weeks into using it, light usage, the plastic adapter stripped and the complete filter assembly constantly falls off. Whether you tighten the adapter by hand or lightly with a wrench, it won't matter, the design seems inferior due to its plastic design. Why couldn't they just make a metal adapter, as that's the most stressed point of the filter."
1,"Great expectations, faulty execution.","When it worked, it was great, with good tasting water. Unfortunately it started leaking some two months afterwards (and this is the second faucet we bought). It must be so poorly engineered that it was probably designed either by the Army Corps of Engineers, or a family member of a P&G bigwig. When using this defective leaking faucet, you end up mixing unfiltered water (as it dribbles or shoots form the side) with the filtered, defeating the purpose of the product (unless the sole purpose is for P&G to make money from this system). I suggest that PUR should set up a recall area on their website for the faucets and/or take back unused filters from customers that have been affected. The reviews on Amazon show a common thread."
1,Keeps Cracking,I purchased this and for the first few weeks it worked great then it developed a crack on the part that attaches to the faucet. I thought this might a fluke so I ordered another one & a few weeks later it developed another crack in nearly the exact same spot. I would stay away from this product until a stronger product is developed. This is the first water filter I have ever used so I am unable to recommend an alternative.
3,product not as pictured,"The product that was shipped to us is not the version that is pictured here, but the new version with a flip tab and an electronic monitor. There are no reviews available of the new version, as Amazon doesn't explicitly sell it, so no way of knowing about leaks or failures of the electronic component."
4,I was able to get 28 gallons from one cartridge.,We have had faucet filters in the past and they were all quite large. I was very happy that this one is much smaller. The swivel action of the filter compartment makes it even less intrusive. The replacement filters are moderately priced and the installation was very easy. The water is great! the chlorine odor and taste are gone along with other non-detectable nasties.Update 1-27-2011I counted how many gallons of water I get before the filter needs changing. I was able to get 28 gallons from one cartridge.Update 8-16-2011I only got 18-20 Gallons from my last 2 cartridges.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? No
4,Improved design but reliability still uncertain,"Like some other reviewers here, I previously owned a PUR filter which developed a crack just a few months after purchase. I bought this model of PUR filter in July 2012 to replace the cracked PUR filter (which was an older model). The new model has not cracked as of November 2012.Since it's only been a few months in service, I can't comment on the new model's reliability. However, I do like the design of the new model better than the old one. With the new model, it's much easier to replace the disposable filter cartridge."
2,"Great Filter, Awful Mount","I'm sure the filter itself is great, but I'll never know for sure because the mount that holds the filter in place is worthless. After about 5 uses is started to leak. I tried to retighten it to my faucet but the plastic threads just aren't strong enough to hold up the heavy filter.The last straw was last time I turned on the water, the whole filter (mount and all) came crashing down into my sink.Maybe it will work better in your sink, but for me it's worthless. Don't bother with this product until Pur fixes the mount."
1,Threw mine away,This would not install on my kitchen faucet because it it a pull out type. I tried installing it in my bathroom only to have the knob freeze up.
4,awesome~,I just love this filter. It was insanely easy to get on my faucet and the water tastes as good as any bottle water. I definitely recommend it.
1,plastic faucet fittings?,Cheap plastic faucet fittings. Less rigidity of the plastic fittings causes it to loosen and leak. Plastic will wear out faster and can't handle the pressure. Why would you do this?
2,Faucet waster mount leaks.,"I did not even get 4 months into this filter before it started to leak around the indicator on top. I thought by replacing the filter it would help, but just made it worse. I really wish I would have seen these reviews before wasting my money on this filter. Now I am stuck with a bunch of PUR replacement filters I hope I can return. 'Pur and simple' this Pur filter is GARBAGE! Although, water did taste better, this is the only reason I gave it two stars and not one."
4,"Crisp, Clean tasting water from your faucett","I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the water. I was expecting it to taste more like bottled water and just ""less dirty"" than tap water, but I believe it tastes even better than most bottled waters. The third stage of the filtration is what I believe makes a difference, and it is worth getting the 3 stage versus the 2 stage. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the replacement filters are so costly. Nevertheless, this is more economical in the long run than buying bottled water, not to mention the convenience of getting it from the faucett versus dragging a case of bottled water up a flight of stairs every week!"
1,"Great Taste, Bad construction","I switched from Brita pitcher to Pur faucet filter, for its ease. Within 1 year, I changed twice, and now am back to the pither. The first one started leaking within 3 months from the age indicator window. Soon it sprung leaks, and then parts fell off. I got another one, because I had purchased expensive filters. THe exact same thing happened again. Yesterday I switched to Brita pitcher. I will never ever use faucet filter again. I read bad comments about Brita faucet too"
1,"I'm buying a culligan, this unit is horrible","If you can afford to buy a new one every 6 months then go for it. It will leak, it will crack, it will spray everywhere. The company obvious doesn't care as people have to buy new units over and over again. I am now on my 7th unit!!!!, I'm done and buying a Culligan."
1,Had to return- product keeps falling off the faucet,"I've used the Pur faucet products for years now. They are always good while they last (a year or two, max in our small office where they get pretty heavy use). This one is the worst of the bunch. Maybe I just got a defective model, but the way this one is supposed to work is you screw a Pur-supplied adapter onto your faucet and then the filter clicks into the adapter. The ""click"" isn't very secure and the thing falls off at a moment's notice. After 5-10 tries playing around with a wrench and the various adapters, I've given up and returned it."
2,Try a different brand,I bought this Pur water filter in June 2011 and after less than 9 months of use it started leaking from 2 different areas of the housing. There should not be 3 streams of water when I want filtered water! This new style is horrible and apparently doesn't last. I'm shopping for a new water filtering system now and Pur is not a consideration. It's a shame - the water tasted great. But the actual filtering system is clumsy to use and apparently not well made. Don't waste your money!
1,I really hate the short life expectancy of this products!!!!,"What ever you do stay away from the low quality of PUR, either the mount is licking or the plastic mount wears off and you're stuck with replacement filters so you have to buy the faucet again because this clever guys don't sell the spare parts to fix their ridiculous plastic materials. I miss the old made in the usa quality products, is a shame how companies are so focused in sales and forgot about the consumer and its satisfaction. I had enough of PUR and will never buy again any of their products no matter how cheap they are, you get what you pay for and in this case less trust me!"
1,Three broke on me.,"Three filters broke on me. I complained to the company, who did not respond. I won't buy another of their products after that."
3,Wondering if it will last,"I obtained two of these, and this one differs from the other only in the way it mounts (vertically, instead of horizontally).I had higher hopes for this product than were warranted. When I received it and took a look, it seemed far flimsier than I'd anticipated, so I'm not sure that it's going to even last a year--and if not, there will be no need for purchasing new filters. While it installed easily enough, I don't feel confident that it will stay in place for the long haul. I'm going to reserve judgment for the time being and give it a few months to prove itself. I will revisit this review in a few months to update the performance and durability."
2,Did not fit our faucet,"The water filter looked nice, but alas, did not fit my faucet. Our faucet is about 11 years old so I don't know if this only fits newer faucets but could not use it."
1,It's a toy!!!!!,I have been buying PUR water filters for over 6 years. The are terrible now!!!!! I switched to a GE water filter from Home Depot. I love it and I will never buy a PUR water filter again!
4,"i love the item, very compact and cool design and 10x better than the previous one i had which stood on the counter/sink.","i like the design of this filter, the switching action between filter and regular tap is very smooth. another thing i liked about this item is its space saving design which means no more hoses snaking around the sink. Very happy with my purchase."
2,Seems to have died after 2-3 weeks,"Maybe it's all of the crap in LA Municipals water, but the filter element of this thing seems to have been worn out after having owned it for a little over two weeks. It still works, but the flow is way slower than it was when it was new. The overall design of the unit is effective, and the price is low, but the replaceable filter doesnt seem to hold up well to urban water supplies. If anyone else who lives in a big city has encountered anything like this, please let me know as I'd be interested in knowing more about this problem and if there are any solutions. You can just comment on my comment. Thanks."
2,Okay at first then...........,"Bought this filter through Amazon, got it on the fawcett with a little work. Works flawlessly until about 6 months and around the pivot point ( where it tilts back and forth) it is starting to leak. I contacted PUR customer service a few times and they don't respond. I'm still waiting for satisfaction. So if any PUR rep is reading this, I'm still waiting on a replacement. Maybe someone could make an effort to reach me through Amazon so I don't have to put my contact info out in the open here."
2,Product Breaks Down and Leaks...,"After less than a year, the product leaks terribly from the neck, that attaches to the faucet, just below the Mounting Nut.....the product is only as good as the weakest part!"
1,Complete waste of money and cause of endless headaches,"Do not waste your money on this junk!!!I purchased this filter last October and initially was impressed. The filtered water tasted better than my old Brita on tap filter and it seemed to work great. About a month in the problems began.......The weight of the filter puts too much strain on the tap connection and eventually strips out the plastic connector. Rendering the filter useless. After contacting Pur they sent out a metal replacement fitting that worked fine until now. Again the weight of the unit has now stripped out the metal threads on the faucet tap. So now I not only have a useless filter, but a ruined faucet. Oh and I still have three filters from a six pack I purchased that should be great for......"
5,Good Deal and Works Well.,I purchased this item about a month ago using Prime shipping and received it no problem in 2 days free shipping. The filter box was in good shape survived the trip well. Out of the box its already assembled I just had to look at the pictures to figure out what to do. Installation was simple no tools required! Albeit the snap on connection does seem minorly loose. It wiggles when water pressurizes it.The water tastes so much better now. I live in a big city so my water is clean already but it has a flavor to it and the filter takes it away. I paid 24 bucks for it so overall I'm very satisfied. This is good for people that are trying to save money on bottled water but don't want to fiddle with a dumb brita jug filter or pay a silly amount for a filter.
1,planed obsolesence,I believe these things were designed only to last for a short period of time. we just purchased our third one. the first one lasted for two years before it developed a hair line crack below the little filter window. so its off to wallyworld for our second unit. the second unit lasted a full six months before it sprung a leak (another hair line crack just like the first one)so I decided to see if I could repair the crack with some J B weld which worked fine for about a week untill another crack surfaced!! if the one we have now goes belly up soon we will be contacting the company for a refund.
4,"Quick, relatively cheap solution","This product isn't particularly pretty, but it's cheaper than the under-sink type filter and, presumably, provides clean water in these days when we can't take for granted the safety of anything we eat or drink. I haven't tested the water, so I'm basing my assumption of effective filtering on faith. The filter is large, and the way it fits means it's harder to fit a large pot underneath, so take your faucet height/sink depth into account when considering this. It doesn't leak, and we've had no problems so far."
2,Not Pur-fect,"We got this filter as it is the only one we found that removed chlorine.We are on the 3rd one. The thing leaks to the point that one time the water was blasting across the room. I was given a $10 coupon towards a replacement.I can not say that I would highly recommend it, but it still seems the only game in town for a decent faucet mounted unit."
2,developed crakafter 2 months,"like another reviewer my filter developed a crack after only a couple of months. The water tasted great while it lasted. I tried a brita faucet filter also and the filter would just pop out of its mount with increased water pressure. I don't know what i will do now, but I need to filter my water b/c it tastes so gross and I drink a lot of water so a pitcher wont work for me."
1,Won't Stay on Faucet! 2nd one purchased in a month,"I have owned at least 10 PUR faucet mount filters since I discovered them over 14 yrs ago. I had to replace last one due to everyday wear and tear. I ordered the latest 9400 series. I could not even get the washer to stay on with pliers...Plastic junk. Ordered a second since I didn't want to wait the 3 weeks for a replacement. It was the same junky washer system even though I got an older version. These guys need to spend a little more time on QC and less time on bells and whistles. If you call the 800-PURLINE hotline, you can order a new replacement washer mount. I called and they are open M-F reg business hours. So, I guess we can all call from WORK."
2,did not work with our faucet,"We ordered this PUR faucet to use it with our mudroom sink, so that we could get good drinking water without having to come all the way into the kitchen (which would be very handy as we run out the door, so that we're using refillable bottles rather than wasting money on disposables). However, we were unable to attach the PUR to our faucet, because our mudroom sink has a Delta laundry faucet that has a nozzle with the same size as an outdoor faucet (like the kind you'd use with your hose).We contacted PUR to see if they had a remedy, and they very helpfully sent us several nozzle adapters to try, but none of them fit either. So we were unable to install or use the PUR, which is a bummer. I doubt most people here would be trying to use it with a mudroom sink, but I thought it was worth mentioning just in case!"
2,Believe everything you read,My wife and I read many reviews on this faucet system and decided that the price is right. We read the warnings about pieces falling off and other problems. We went ahead and bought it. Those warnings were all true. We bought this within the last 7 months and within 3 months the decorative chrome plate at the faucet fell off. Just last week a crack developed where the PUR device connects to the kitchen faucet and it sprays water everywhere. I was happy with the filtered water but I will not buy this product again. In fact I doubt I would buy any PUR product again. My reasoning for this is that these reviews were over time and PUR has done nothing to fix the problems. We just bought a new fridge and it had a water filter and despenser built in (Inside not on the door) and it works just as well. If you buy PUR you are paying for a name not for a quality product.
3,"Filters fine, feels cheap","This is now the third model of faucet water filter I have owned in the last year. My previous two either developed leaks (old Pur 2-stage) or wore out (Brita unit's filter on/off knob became too hard to turn).This unit installed easily, filters well, and I like the quick flip switch mechanism to turn filtration on/off. However it feels very, very cheap. The plastic is so light, and the quick connector mechanism doesn't feel all that secure. Hopefully this one makes it more than one filter change."
1,NEVER EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Again, DO NOT BUY THIS FAUCET FILTER!I am a frequent buyer at Amazon Prime and I have never hated a product until I bought this Pur Faucet Filter. The picture is totally a false advertisement. They displayed the newest Pur product (""one click"") and what I received was the older version that could not fit any of my faucets! Totally wrong!"
3,It works but is too bulky,"The filter works well and provides clean, good tasting drinking water.I remove it when I am washing dishes because it gets in the way and it is very easy to bump the little lever that makes it work while using hot water for dishes. I have a under sink unit that has a separate faucet but the filters are hard to change (that is why I have been looking for a different type of filter. The water comes out much faster in the under sink unit than the PUR faucet mount and it tastes just as good.Pros- It is very easy to remove using 1 little buttons to release it.It filters the water good, the water tastes good.Filters are easy to change.cons- the filter unit is too bulky and gets in the wayThe water coming out is very slow.When I remove the unit when washing dishes there is no aerator on the faucet with it removed and the water splashes too much."
3,room for improvement,"the product is all-right, however,i was dis-appointed that the company chose to keep fluorite in the water.fluorite is not a good thing to have in the water as we have been led to believe.maybe the company could reconsider and make a filter that would remove fluorite in the water."
5,"A Great, But DATED book This is not 3.0 !!!!!!!!!!!","I have had to make extensive use of some of the new 3.0 features. They are NOT covered here. This is the best organized & best written reference on the subject of Cold Fusion.Unfortunatley it is useless for 3.0 features, I had to use the online manual & the John Burke book to decipher them. To his credit he has not labeled the book 3.0, but he has not labeled it 2.0 either."
2,A SO-SO BOOK ON A FINE PRODUCT,"Typos, errors, missing information and files: The 'Crystal Reports' referenced as being bundled with the book on its accompanying CD-Rom does not exist(specifically file name CR50.EXE is mentioned starting on page 52 for installation but cannot anywhere be located on the diskette). The publisher has, so far, ignored two e-mail requests for correction. The book itself is laden with syntax errors that make testing of certain test code almost impossible. If you're going to rely on this book to get started, be prepared to spend hours and hours on fiddling with corrections of your own. In the vernacular, 'this sucker needs work!'"
5,LUTHER & LEVERT,I WAS SO HAPPY I BROUGHT THIS DVD. I LOVE LUTHER BUT TO SEE LEVERT & HIS BROTHER WHOM HAVE BOTH PASSED SINGING WITH THEIR DAD ... IT BRINGS TEARS TO YOUR EYES. GREAT DVD!!!
1,Worst Christmas Movie Ever,"Bought the movie thinking it would be interesting for our four year old. The movie was terrible! The premise was awful, the notion of wolves eating reindeer not really great for kids movie. There was no humor, and no redeeming story. In fact, the notion the ""Daddy"" reindeer flew in to town and spent one night with the ""Mommy"" reindeer, and then left to never see his unborn son again is not necessarily a good theme. Finally, a purple poodle appearing in the middle of the North Pole. I recognize that snowmen can come to life, but at least make the premise plausible. I wish I had my $12 and 90 minutes of my life back"
1,Reindeer wh#re,"This is not a movi for children, it is a very bad film. I didn't laugh until the end. I feel down and upset because I wanted holiday cheer maybe this is what happens in Europe oh and they're showing this film on CBS tonight."
4,back in nam,"product came as described and shipped on time. this game is quite savy to to the history of the era, havent beat it yet but it's very much like playing history.like the songs a lot"
1,Disappointing,"Karate Warriors was disappointing for three reasons: (1) the quality of the tape was so bad it was almost unwatchable due to blurriness, (2)the fight scenes were poorly filmed and didn't show off Sonny's abilities, and (3) the plot seemed to be a disorganized splicing together of cliches and bad acting. I would NOT recommend this one, but DO recommend his first one Street Fighters."
5,Detailed!!,"What an excellent book! Not only is there a DETAILED and up to date history of the best band to come out of Canada (if not North America) mostly from countless interviews, but there are listings of every show they have played, every setlist they have had, and every piece of equipment they have used on all albums and tours! This book beats the hell out of any of the other books written about Rush. The only flaw is the title - the word ""Merely"" is spelled wrong. However, the words and pictures inside definately make up for it. If you're a Rush fan, buy it."
1,Scientific detail overwhelmed the story,"First Sentence: He could smell them.Kel McKelvey, Director of the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, has been sent to Arkansas in an attempt to unravel the mystery of a forty-year old racial killing and a soldier who was supposed to have died in Vietnam.It started out well but became so overloaded with scientific detail, I decided to move on to something else. Next..."
5,good design,"This is great product, i ordered it, and i received it just as expected, the lightning ray look awesome with my blue fender XD"
4,used for chickens,I bought this wire because of the price with free shipping. I have no complaints. I used it to fence in our chickens and I have had no critters get into our chicken pen. I would buy it again because it cost half the price of other wire and is working fine for us.
5,Absolutely Excellent!,Great examples of drawing and painting from the subject! Excellent photography! Highly recommended for anyone interest in figure drawing and / or painting.
2,Paper Tray Problems,We purcahsed two of these for work. Both have problems with the supplmental trays. About 6 times out of 10 these jam and the printer reports being out of paper. The frustration level does not justify the investiment.
4,HP K550DTN Printer,"Relatively fast. Printing both sides is nice if you use paper that is thick (heavy) enough. Dual, large paper trays eliminates running out of paper mid job. Appears on my home network and is instantly usable by all computers. As usual, replacement printheads and cartridges will easily outrun the cost of this printer."
2,"Quality Black print, average color, poor duplexing","This model does a good job on single-sided black documents. Period. Duplexing is problematic. Paper jams should be expected and are routine. Complex two-sided jobs such as booklets should be left to the more competent laser printer. It is admitedly not a photo printer, so don't waste your time or photo paper printing your snapshots. Spot color and an occasional photo on a brochure are about all this printer is capable of. Ink cartridges are expensive if you use the high-yield versions. Only buy this printer if it is heavily discounted. Not quite a piece of junk but not one of HPs best efforts either."
1,VietCong:Purple Haze SUCKS!,"I haven`t played many Vietnam games-only Men of Valor,Conflict:Vietnam,ShellShock:Nam `67 and this[VietCong:Purple Haze] and BY FAR i think that this is the worst its so boring,not-original sub-par graphics,worst of all the AI sucks.Only buy it if you see it somewhere for about 63 cents which is not bad for this game.It has no strategy-so it is your typical run n gun FPS where you shoot the hell outta everything.If you want a good Vietnam-War game for XBox go ahead and buy Men Of Valor-believe me that is the best Vietnam game on XBox but also try Conflict:Vietnam and ShellShock.I threw the game away into the nearest garbage bin.WORST GAME ETHA!"
3,Mediocre at best,"Rented this game from the local rental store, wouldn't recommend it. PS2 style characters and controls, if you've rented everything else then go ahead, otherwise try something else first."
1,à éviter à tout prix,"Bon avec tout les nouveaux soft sur la guerre du Vietnam ca devient lassant. Vietcong, n'est pas super pourquoi, coté graphiques cé quand meme potable on a deja vue pire pour des sortie récentes mais le hic cé que dans ce jeux il n'y aucun ambience on a du mal a se mettre dans la peau de nos héros et les décors de la jungles sont vraiment mal fait ce qui nous donne encore moin l'impression d'y etre. le scénario est lamentable a ce demander s'il en a vraiment un. les enememis tire de partout on sait jamais de ou ca provient donc on fait pareille on tire dans tout les sens sans savoir sur quoi on vise exactement. les fan de fps du style M.O.H comme moi seront tres decu de ce vietcong. bref peu divertir quelque temps mais pas plus. Men of valor a l'air beaucoup mieux."
2,"Dull, easy game","Nothing much to say about this game other than that this game sucks really bad. Comparatively speaking, Mike Tyson's Punchout is a great game with good graphics and a all time classic. This game is easy to play and easy to master and the fighters are lack luster at best. Its just not a good fighting game to get. Get Punch out or Mike Tyson's Punchout."
3,Interesting although somewhat impractical. . .,"This book was not exactly what I had expected. Although the photographs are beautiful and the book is filled with interesting alternatives to common furniture items, it is somewhat impractical for anyone with budget constraints. Alternatives to regular furniture are suggested by top home interior designers and artists, which make them lovely and innovative, but beyond the monetary reach of most people (they include expensive antiques, etc). I had expected something a little more applicable to everyday life."
3,good job,there do good job on time. well buy form them do good job on time.playing dvd dvd dvd or games
5,Nylon Gibson Guitar Strap,"I've owned this strap for over 15 years. Still functions well. Still my favorite. Surprisingly, I find this simple nylon strap to be the most comfortable guitar strap I've ever used. I've paid upwards of $50 for my other straps (leather and padded) and still I come back to this one. Most of all, I love to watch other guitarists squirm at the irony of watching me use this Gibson strap with my other non-Gibson guitars!"
3,"There are better ""scientific"" body building books out there","As a book that has ""scientific"" in its title, I was expecting to read about how their workout routines & techniques were proven in a controlled setting. I saw a lot of theory in the book, but no documentation to back up their claims. Their methods may well work, but since every book claims to have the best way to build muscles in the shortest amount of time, this book doesn't rise above any of the others I've read."
2,rigid programme,"I leafed through this book in a store and was impressed by the workout. I carefully analzyed the programme and attempted to do the routine. Although I found the workout solid and logical, it was very rigid. My body recovered at different stages and i found it very confusing to stay on target. I was often faced with being too sore to do this part of the workout but not the other. Delaying the sore parts a day would impact future workouts to the point that I could not keep the workout on track. You would be left with too much or too little to do on a given day because you were monitoring your body's recovery. After a couple months, I gave up on the book. If you do not do the workout in the book, it has little reference value."
2,Not the Best Book for an Action Junkie,"The plot of On, Off was psychologically interesting and the plot twists were surprising. But it took me months to read the book, because the story dragged so much in places. There are a lot of potential suspects here, and the author spends much too much time describing them and their lives, and too little time on the meat of the story. (The motivation for the crimes.) The two subplots were also uninteresting and yet another stall in the plot line.Maybe I was so disappointed with this book because I'm an action junkie. But my ultimate thought was, good story -- poor execution."
2,bad choice,When I received this product it was in bad shape with most of the Millet off the stem and loose in the bag. Would not recommend.
4,Great cardio interval training,"For anyone who remembers the ESPN show ""Fitness Pros"", the instructor will be a familiar face. Tracy is insanely energetic and gives good cues. The movements are sometimes simple, sometimes more difficult to get but are always challenging. She takes you through a bunch of ""intervals"" where you work above your normal aerobic state for periods of a minute or less each. Interval training is the hot new way to train your heart to recover more quickly from strenuous activity and speed up your metabolism for hours afterwards. As with most Crunch tapes, the short time frame means not as good of a warm up or cool down, but the cardio section is great and well worth the effort to learn the moves. A lot of fun. END"
1,"too fast to follow, not for beginners","I bought this tape, and when I tried to do it I got so frustrated. I think it's for more intermediate fitness levels, those who know the moves or something. I have done step aerobics, and love it, it's much easier to follow. This was really annoying, so much so that I threw it in the trash, only after literally pulling the tape out of the cassette!"
1,"Hey Buffy, let's do aerobics!",Aaack. The instructor and cast are so darn cutesy in their little spandex get-ups. This video is pure cheese. Get your workout running far away from this video.
5,Highly recommended!,This 2-cd set is wonderful! Has the best of the best worship music. Every moving song followed by another great one.
4,The beat goes on,"Blunted Beatz is an interesting blend of club sound, jazz and lounge. Each cd sets a different mood but overall its mellow. It's a good chance to hear artists that you may know as mainstream; do their thing. I can't get enough."
3,just so so,"size is ok ,but it leaked a little bit when i baked a cake .so i need to use a baking paper..."
2,Not good,"I tried to bake a cheesecake with this and the pan leaked everywhere. There are ridges on the bottom of the pan, which made it hard to take the bottom of the pie off of. I wasged it once and it already rusted up. I will probably never use it again. I gave it 2 stars because it half-did its intended purpose..."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Oddballs, including the private investigator.Yep, I tried this book because I liked the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and probably needn't have bothered, as it was only ok. Some more of the odd sort of things happening, but not in a funny way, really, as the titular character looks into the bizarre actions of a friend, and the strange goings on that may tie everything together."
5,Douglas Adams/Dirk Gently Sequel,"Douglas Adams & Dirk Gently strike again. Wonderfully hilarious sequel to ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"". Anyone who loved the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe"" series should not miss the Dirk Gently books. Douglas Adams you are truly missed."
5,Hysterical!,"I'm puzzled by how many people seem to have had difficulty with this book. True, it's confusing as can be -- but any good mystery novel has you guessing at every step of the way. I rarely even smile while reading a book, no matter how funny. But this one had me laughing out loud from the minute the poor Electric Monk is believing the world is pink. No, this isn't a book for people who like simple plots and kindergarten writing. But for those who can handle wit, satire, and complex story-telling -- this one's a gem!Honestly, probably one of the funniest books I've read in my whole life (with the exception of ""Good Omens,"" I should add...)!"
3,"Well, it was interesting?","I can't say I really enjoyed this book as much as his other works. The story was something he would write about, and he filled it with that awfully hilarious humor he is known by so well, but he made it terribly obvious he hated God and religion in general, and I couldn't stand it. So read it if you can ignore his agenda in the book or if you agree with his beliefs, but otherwise, just stick with Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, friend."
5,Excellent book to understand network optimization,I have been working in the telecom industry for over 9 years. I have been invloved with the development of decision support systems for network planning and design at one of the largest carriers in the world. Optimization is a misused word but this book does an excellent job of presenting useful and practical techniques for network optimization. If you are interested in quantitaive analysis and design of real networks this is a good book to have.
4,Comfy,"Slippers are fine, they have a little inersole in them, not as warm as I had hoped, but they work. I will wear them out."
3,"Kora, kora, kora","This midlife-crisis-pilgrimage-travelogue is not as large in scope as its name implies. Still it is a very readable and entertaining assortment of short takes on an unorthodox trip around the world and through the author's restless mind. Greenwald so loves the Tibet region, though, that one feels he failed really to enjoy the the long trip through the rest of the big world in his eagerness to get there before dashing home. Ah, well, it was his kora, and we can only hope he takes us along on his next adventure."
5,Excellent resource for all opera fans.,"This is an excellent book for someone like me - a total novice to Wagner and his music. I have always enjoyed Wagner's music and was desperately looking for some introductory material to his works. What I wanted was something that was not too simplistic and not too academic. Well, this is it.The book contains a brief section on biography followed by a great introduction to each of Wagner's operas. I read each of the opera introductions at least twice and then watch the opera on DVD (The Met's version by Levine). What a treat!I do understand how some of the more scholarly amongst us find this work shallow and demeaning. But friends, for someone like myself, who does not read music; and has no formal training in music, books such as these are a good first start. And who knows - this book may introduce some yet unknown kid to the joys of opera.Excellent work. Thank you."
2,Only songs on this DVD - No stories were included,"I have two girls 5 and 2 years old that love watching and dancing to HI-5. Unfortunately, this DVD only has singing in it. We enjoy Hi-5 because of the music AND the stories. I wish the DVD had included a description to let me know it was just singing and dancing. [...]."
4,Beautiful layout. Great coffee table book,I'm a big fan of architectural photography and heard an interview with the author months ago on NPR. This is a beautiful book with a great layout. Makes a wonderful addition to my coffee table.
5,Great buy!,Excellent little book to have on hand! I even take it grocery shopping with me in case I forget if I can have something or not. Very happy I purchased it.
4,Keep on me at all times!,This is a great pocket manual. It defers from the actual book in that some of the DON'Ts are listed as NEUTRAL..but I try my best to follow it all the same.Very pleased.
5,Should be reprinted!,"This book was compiled during World War II when the human spirit desperately needed lifting. It is an anthology of short stories with religious/spiritual themes, not dated by the book's age. Someone should definitely reissue this book, possibly with revisions to include stories from more recent years."
5,Excellent video and no need for equipment,"This is by far the hardest of the Nikkifitness videos. I have done all of them numerous times and thought to myself that this one could not be as challenging due to the lack of weights. I was wrong!! This is such a great video because it is shot in different locations and transitions very quickly. I could not believe when it was over, it had felt like only 15 or 20 minutes had past. The other thing is I was sore in spots the next day that when in the gym I do not always hit with the weights or machines. There were a lot of new exercises that were so effective and fun to do. All around a great video, especially when traveling because you need to take nothing but sneakers and a video."
5,Interpol-Words Can't Do Them Justice,"If someone asked me to describe this album in one word,it would be: ""Wow"".Interpol is a great little band from NY that really knows how to make an unforgettable song.And they really showed it on this CD.This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to all the way through without having to skip a track.Although,it is hard to choose which song to listen too because they are all incredible.No matter if it's the looming ""Obstacle 1"", the enchantingly beat-driven ""PDA"", The squeaky clean ""Say Hello To The Angels"", or the lullaby-esque ""Stella Was A Diver, And She Was Always Down"", you just can't lose.The only thing bad about this album is that if you pass it up,you may kill yourself.And no one wants that to happen.Whatever you do,buy this album.It will NOT disappoint you."
5,Excellent review for electricity unit,R. Krampf was entertaining and factual. I used this video as a review for finals - another way to cover materials. I was so impressed that I plan to subscribe to his web site this summer so I can access other videos and information during the school year. Worth every penny!
2,Disturbing.. very disturbing,"I had a lot of issues with this book. the first one was simply that heros do NOT rape their women. in this case it was so that cassie wouldnt be a virgin so that she wouldnt be able to run back to the man she loves, edward. secondly, heros do not beat their women - no matter what! yeah cassie disobeyed him, but he kidnapped her!i felt that coulter had read up on Stockholm syndrome and decided it would be a good idea to write a book about it. the only reason this book got 2 stars was because coulter's writing style was excellent as compared to her other books (ie: the sherlock series)dont read this book! thats my advice."
2,Unprepared for the violence,"This is not Coulter's best novel. I can get past the kidnappping and of the main character and go along with that plot line, but I was totally unprepared for the violent rape of the main character by strangers. This is the only Coulter book that portrays this graphic violence, so it came as a shock. Beware this book."
2,Disturbing,I have read several of Coulter's books and love most of them. I read this books some years ago and was like most of the readers completely disturbed by it. I couldn't get past the gang rape and almost didn't finish the book because of this. I had even purchased the series prior to reading this one and i have yet to read that one because this one distrubed me so much. This is defintely not for the faint of heart. I read romance novels to escape the everyday and look forward to a happy uplifting book this book is defintely not the one to read if you are looking for that and what makes it worst is the second novel is about there daughter and the son of the women responsible for Cassie being gang raped how twisted is that!
4,ever watch disney?,"I loved this book. I do not approve of the rape scene, but if you have seen Disney's Beauty and the Beast, and liked it, how can you condem this book? Belle is forced to live in the castle in exchange for her father, and she falls in love with an animal. Literally. This movie is shown to our children in this country, and it has the same basic storyline. I enjoy Catherine Coulters books, and this one is among my collection and is not going anywhere."
1,Okay I handle reading about rape but ripped and baby killing,"When I read review for this I thought okay so the hero rapes her in some old fashion woman taking fashion I can read that. I was tempted to read it. Well that wasnt the issue with me, although it was a far cry from sexy his rape was nothing compared the her being torn apart later in the book. Unless you enjoy hearing about women being sewn back together after a rape or a baby being killed I strongly suggest you dont read this. I admit I was enjoying the book and really getting into it but that part, that chapter, put that to a dead stop what a waste of a good book. I was enthrawled and enjoying myself and had it all ripped away from me in that later chapter - what a waste of my time what a waste of some good writing. Unless you want to go from ""into a great book"" to wanting to burn it in 2 seconds flat I suggest you avoid it."
2,Repulsed and bored,"I am a big fan of Coulter's but this book is boring. Rape is not romantic and that is what she keeps trying to feed us. Page after page of Cassie being forced to sleep (naked) with someone she does not like or love. What is romantic about that?? Oh she learns to love him.... really! I believe they do have documented cases where victims learn to revere their captors. Not very entertaining!! But, please don't judge Coulter by this book. She does actually write ""nicer"" novels about romance and women!"
4,Comfy,"the boots are very comfortable and I love the, but I don't like that the sides flop down. Thats really my only compliant about the boot. If you don't mind the flop look these boots are for you!"
2,boots,I did not like these boots. I sent them back. When I bought them I did'nt get to see a good picture of them and if I had I wouldn't have bought them. They didn't zip all the way up. They velcroed at the top and the velcro wouldn't stick. Glad it was easy to send them back
4,Italian Home Recipes,Want to make Italian home recipes? This book has your nana's cooking in it. Great way to preserve your heritage.
5,Preserving out Italian Heritage,I have owned this great cookbook for years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I ordered 3 for Christmas gifts this year. It has all the recipies that my Grandmother used to make for us as children and many more.
3,A good book but only for part of it.,"Let's just be straight forward. This book was confusing through the first half and was just not good. Through out the second half it got a little better and seemed to be not that bad. The real shocker though was the ending. I mean, if you don't know what is going to happen in the series it's a shocker, but otherwise it still was a little surprising."
2,Skip the book,Contact a Lawyer to go over your paperwork before signing anything. Laws vary from state to state.
3,Vivencias,"This Paris live recording captures our hero in his prime, his voice is strong and clear. There's a lot of energy and pure joy in this show. The sound quality is brilliant for being 1976.However, there are some flaws as well. The bass player sucks. Sounds like he's taken a valium too much, which nearly destroys beautiful numbers such as 'A veces tu, a veces yo', 'El amor' and 'Abrazame'. Generally the band would have needed more rehearsal time as well.Julio's unintelligible French showcase presumably led to some good fun with the ladies afterwards but gets very tedious for the record listener. This meaningless chatting is put at the start of the tracks which means that you in some cases have to listen to it for 1-2 minutes before the music actually starts.Overall a good document of the phenomenon that Julio is, recommended for really devoted fans."
3,"Its a good book, full of colored pictures and instructions but...","I haven't gone through full detail reading the book, but it'll make you feel more confident in rebuilding the engine. It'll also make you more weary about starting because it shows how much meticulous effort you must put in order to avoid future oil leaks.What I don't like about this book is that it makes you need to buy his other book (101 projects for your porsche) if you do not already know how to remove the engine. Removing a porsche engine requires more work than something like a chevy small block because you must lift the car up and remove the engine from underneath. I don't see why the author just didn't include the few extra pages in this book as it is required to rebuild an engine."
5,Perfect all!!,El llibre esltà genial. Molt bé de preu i molt explicatiu. Jo el recomano per a aquelles persones que tinguin un Porsche i vulguin saber una mica més sobre els seus motors. Et dona concells molt ven explicats de com millorar o restaurar els nostres motors.L'únic inconvenient és que has de saber anglès. Però no és complicat d'entendre amb un nivell mitjà.
3,its ok,"gameplay is a little off, hard to make shots without fouling, hard to drive to the hoop without fouling, much better when u play 2 on 2 than 1 on 1 because the running around by 4 characters creates a lot more opportunities to score"
2,A Very Boring Read,"I purchased this book as a requirement for a course I was taking. Although the title did appeal to me, since it is a topic that I have a high interest in, I was pretty much disappointed after having read through it. It was hard to read and understand, I had to reread through many of the chapters. I think the topic was great, I just don't feel the authors did justice to the topic."
4,much better than her usual,"Have read quite a few DS books, and I thought this was probably the best. The previous one I had read, ""Wings,"" had the corniest dialogue ever. (Am I the only one thinking that Danielle quit writing these books years ago??)The singer/cowboy romance was a little unbelievable, but I didn't take that too seriously."
1,I want my money back!,"There was not one page of this novel that was written beyond a grade three level. The grammar and repetition were deplorable.It's amazing what millions of dollars can do to cloud someones judgement.This book belongs in the trashcan, not on any bestseller list.Steel and the publisher should be ashamed for cheating their readers in order to line their own pockets!!!"
1,Please Dont Buy,"Item lasted 1 year and being that I purchased it new in the box from eBay, Sport dog will not uphold warranty. Item comes with a two year warranty and the transmitter just mysteriously stopped working. Warranty department is a brick wall. Do not buy this product unless you want the run around."
3,Works but...,This product works very well. However my father in-law's Boxer chewed up the collar. I would have hoped it were more durable. Replacement collars also appear to be quite expensive even without the receiver.
4,Great product,"Our dog was not as stubborn as we thought. Used it several times, dog is very sensitive I kept it on near the lowest setting and that's all it took."
2,Worked for about 2 months,"I had this collar for about 2 months before it went kaput. I have an almost 80lb boxer and the collar worked fantasticially until I dropped the remote from hip height (I am 5'8"") and it didn't break and nothing came lose in the remote, but it does not make the collar respond anymore. I have emailed the company and they told me that since it was dropped I am SOL. Hence I am out 230 bucks for a piece of crap that should be able to handle being thrown across the room let alone dropped 3 feet. Look for a different collar. This one is not worth the money you would spend on it."
5,Finally Scourge has come back to TRU,"After months of waiting and speculation the Super Sized Scourge from RID is here!!! Going from we don't know if he's coming out, to he's not to, Ok, Ok He's a ... exclusive, to being 2 months over due. He has finally arrived!Great repaint of the Generation 2 Laser Optimus Prime and my favorite transformers toy mold he is a piece the fandom has been clamoring for since the original Black Convoy shipped in Japan (I can retire my Black Convoy now). The Truck's windows are a darker red than Black Convoy and his sword is as well (Black Convoy's sword and windows bordered on pink) and the addition of generation 1 Deception symbols on the truck doors and robot's shoulders are a beautiful touch. This is everything we were hoping fore and more. Ok he doesn't have the electronics that Laser Optimus had, but that's a small price to pay.THANK YOU HASBRO!!!!!!"
5,The best Transformer ever put out in the RID line,"I have seen it all of the transformer world for the past 20 years, and this is got to be the one of the best i have seen. ive seen the primes,megatrons, magnuses, and this has to be the best one.i have almost the whole series of the RID line and this has to be the best one around. Scourge resembles laser prime a lot except for the color, and when a light is shinning on his head his eyes glow that is really cool. i recommend this bot while it is still availble if it is...."
2,Why I did not find this book useful,"The books spends a lot of its content on explaining WHY networking is important. That didn't go down well with me...I wouldn't have spent time reading the book if I didnt value networking in the first place.Secondly, it has a lot of tips on subjects to keep conversations going. I was really interested in finding out how conversations are STARTED but rather how to go out and make a cold start with someone."
1,God and pony show,"King Amma, The Super dooper pooper scooper. A very bad joker. Watch out for her subtle beings floating around the room, cause if you don't like her, she might sic em on ya! Buyer beware!"
1,Fail,I can hear the external noises amplified through the ear piece. This product could not bite more. Do not purchase ilov products.
5,I Passed Them Both,"A good education, a solid review of this book and a dose of common sense should helpyou easily pass both tests on the first try.Heed the advice about having an early night before the test date. Bring a bunch of #2pencils, and dress very comfy in layers. These things make a big difference.I saved about an hour for the essay, which I needed, and scored 300 on it.Use the first few hours going through the multiple choice questions. No need to rush.I hope it goes well for you! I leave you with this quote:""Chance favors the prepared mind.""Louis Pasteur"
1,Many errors detract from the usefulness of this book,"I purchased this book in preparation for the NYS Teacher Certification Exams. I was hoping for it to be as good as the other reviewers said it was. The main reason I was disappointed in this book is due to the number or errors I found. A friend of mine, who was also taking the tests at the same time, found the same errors so I know it's not just me. Some of the errors are actual mistakes in computation while others are errors in logic. In some cases the answer given is correct but the explanation is wrong or vice versa. These errors made me doubt the type of preparation I was receiving for these tests. Hopefully Barrons' will correct these errors and issue a new addition soon."
3,Hard to swallow,the only problem that I have with this is that it is very hard to swallow.. It takes me several attempts just to swallow one tablet
5,Great Harold Arlen tunes for beginning & intermediate guitar,"Mark Hanson has done a fine job of arranging the original orchestrations for fingerstyle guitar. Some of it is approachable by the advanced beginner; intermediate guitarists should find their efforts rewarded with a fun little repetoire which offers room for musical expression. (There are some fairly tricky harmonics.) The more advanced guitarist can develop a suite with much charm and a great deal of humor.Mark's study notes anticipate most technical problems the student will encounter. It would have been helpful if they were printed with each piece instead of in their own section. As usual, the CD is a great study aid. CDs with music books are the greatest thing since the pull tab. Oh, and I wish they'd printed Yip Harburg's wonderful lyrics somewhere. In TAB and standard notation."
5,BZ The Little Bruddah Body Board,I really like this board. im 6'2 and 200 lbs. Ive always liked BZ boards because I always find them strong and fast. I have grown since my last board the T-10 which is another good board. But i was too heavy and I would drag on the waves. With the 43.5 inch Little Bruddah I have found tremendous improvement. Its much lighter and stronger then the T-10. I highly recommend one to purchase this board. You will not regret it. A++
3,How many more times?,I found this tape enjoyable once I got the dance steps down. It took me a couple times and some of them are tricky. It definitly would help having a dance background. My biggest complaint with the tape is the instructor kept saying one more time and I never knew how to correctly pace myself.
2,Not easy to follow,"This was a little conplex and not easy to follow, as some reviews said.I'd look at another."
2,Poor performance,I didn't like this tool. It wasn't ergonomic to use and only did a mediocre job. The Zyliss FastCut works much better and is easier to clean.
5,For King and Country.,After spending several years reading the Patrick O'Brian books I found this in paperback. While it doesn't have the scope of 'the longest running narrative in the English language' it does have an authentic flavor and a wonderful archaic style. Enjoyed immensely.
5,Very entertaining,"This program is jam-packed with interesting tidbits. A lot of fun for adults and kids. Plus, I learned a lot. Who knew that almost all the children crossed the country barefoot!"
4,The Oregon Trail,This is entertaining for an evening's viewing but lacking in enough research to be the only piece a researcher would want to get the whole story.
3,A good introduction,While not remotely the best produced documentary I've ever seen I'm happy with the purchase. There was good information and it raised my interest in doing further research on various points addressed in the video.
5,Nice Product,"The book is a nice introduction and explanation to the various styles of different artists in the pin-up genre. I have always been a fan of pin-ups, but definitely prefer a particular style of pin-ups. This book allowed me to look at many different artists, see excellent pictures of their work, and find those that I can now research a bit more. Great book!"
2,"Better than a stick in your eye, but. . .","I have to admit this book was pretty lame. A lot of common sense, pretty charts and diagrams, but overall pretty shallow. Seems to be a poor compilation of material better covered elsewhere. Get's kinda preachy over a WRITTEN financial plan. I don't necessarily agree. Seems to answer most people's financial problems by saying, ""Cut your expenses to the bone, deprive yourself and your family for a brief 25 years, save your money, get an 8% annual return and you'll be financially set someday. And if you're not saving enough, just cut more out of your budget!"" Naive. Far better treatment of the material in ""Richest Man in Babylon"". Also, Mary Hunt's ""Debt Proof Living"" gives real practical ""how-to's"" as opposed to this drivel. On the flip side, there is a little merit to this book if you can discover some of the better nuggets of wisdom amidst the fluff. Pass."
5,Hauling guns..,"I'm glad I finally got a case to transport my guns to the range or where ever I need to go. I was using a back pack and that's not the best way of transporting a gun around, people might get the wrong idea...lol"
5,Works great!,This passed the TSA screen without issue. The gun is secure but the lock isn't going to prevent anyone from getting into the case. With a screw driver and a few minutes they would have your gun in hand.
5,Molto bene,This is great especially on the long commute to work I love to put in a cd and actually do something progressive. These are easy to repeat and follow along.
4,Great Service,"Product is average, but the item was sent to me quickly and in great shape. Thank you =)"
1,"Great movie,not so good game","While the movie The Goonies which came back in 1985 is now one of the most classic films of the 80s,I can't say the same for the game.I found it boring and lame.I wish it was better."
4,Full of interesting things,"This book is very well done, and its listings seem reasonable and informative. The reason I do not give it five stars is because it has no footnotes and no bibliography. For instance, on page 188 Schwartz refers to ""Shaw's leading biographer"" but does not name him nor the title or date of the biography. How simple to have put a footnote on the page, but there is none. But aside from this failing, this is a fun book to read and enjoy."
5,HAIR YE! HAIR YE! A WINNER!,"I search the shelves of bookstores looking for somthing entertaining, informative and well written. Sandra Conroy - yes, she's Pat's wife - is a huge talent whose day in the sun is about to dawn! I loved her book - and I bought 10 copies for friends. In a word, it's simply wonderful."
2,Does not fit all tricycles,"This seatbelt/harness was advertised as a 'frequently bought together' item to go with the Radio Flyer Fold 2 Go XL Trike. However, it does NOT adjust to fit. Please be aware so you don't make the same mistake."
2,Good in Theory,"We purchased the Kettler 3-point harness seatbelt for our daughter's Radio Flyer tricycle after reading that it was compatible.....however when we received it, it could not be used as a 3-point harness seatbelt without making additional cuts & holes in the tricycle seat. Good idea to make a seatbelt, but Radio Flyer needs to make one that fits their tricycles."
3,not a toy,The ratings are based on toy value? I don't know why a seatbelt is categorized as a toy. It makes a fine seatbelt. Easy to install. Shipping and packaging were efficient.
1,Terrible figure,"This figure is absolutely terrible. It cannot move at all, and is not fun to play with. I do not recommend to anyone."
4,Bauhaus 'Gotham - The Video',"An awsome addition to any alternative music video collection! After a long rest, the Bauhaus have reunited recently and are on tour. This video was recorded live on September 9th & 10th 1998 at the Hammerstein Ballroom, New York. I managed to catch this show here in B.C, and it was fantastic. The content of the video is equally as good.Click that order button now!"
5,Fantastic Book,I loved this book so much I'm buying more copies for family members and friends.. Bill Sammon has been on television a lot lately promoting it and I had to check it out..I'm so glad I did.
2,Disappointing,"Purchased because of loyalty to SONY, wanted small HTIB for HDTV in game room. System performed well for one week then, in the middle of ""Saving Private Ryan"" system flashed PROTECT and shut down. Went through very cryptic trouble-shooting routine in the user manual and then contacted SONY support. They were not particularly helpful other than to say it would require SONY service and directed me to a location far, far away. I called Amazon and they were very helpful and immediately sent me a return authorization. I am now shopping for another system."
4,Very good comic book,"If you are a Hans Rodionoff fan such as myself you will not be disappointed in this book at all. This is a prequel of sorts to the movie of the same name, which is also written by Hans. The art work in this series is very good as is the story line. For those of you who think this might be anything like Swamp Thing you would be mistaken. Man-Thing is a ""monster"" with one purpose and thats to kill anything that moves in the swamp :) Check it out, I think you'll like it. If you are looking for one of the ultimate Hans Rodionoff books you should check out 'Lovecraft.' I pretty much stick to Horror comics and it is hands down one of the creepiest out there."
4,Fun game -- good for younger and older fans,"I really enjoyed this game. More importantly, my 4-year old LOVES it (a bit too much, probably). We have great fun playing it together and exploring the different super-powers available and great virtual locations in which the action takes place. Even my wife enjoys playing it occassionally.To the harsh critics of this game: Give it another chance, you may find it grows on you. Admittedly, it's not one of those games that provides any serious challenges (e.g., Half-Life 2) but it's still hours and hours of good bad-guy-smashing fun.Mind you, if you are not a fan of DC Comics, you may be at a disadvantage. If you are, though, you have one more reason to love this simple but entertaining game."
3,"Fun, but could be better","It's a game that while somewhat interesting and entertaining, there are other games that go farther in making an engaging game.. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if Amazon would let me. One thing that bothered me about the game was all the female characters in the game look like they were designed by a 13 year old boy. Exaggerated and unrealistic body parts are the norm, but besides being inappropriate, are just plain gaudy and silly looking. It's a trend allot of comics and games have taken. I know it is a super hero game, but there should be some since of reason in the design of all the characters."
2,caballe recital,"the recital was defectuous and they even sent two. one I do not dare to open for I want, when I go to the States, to be able to send it back. It makes me not want to buy from amazon anymore. last time they asked me to rate a CIELO E MAR by villazon, that came so deffective I could never hear the first aria. Never got a reply. Why do we write this to no avail?LUIS GIRONMAY"
4,Second time just as good as the First!,"Purchased my second Braun 4775 in March. My old one died after 4 straight years of 6X per week service with no problems. I paid twice as much 4 years ago, and didn't seem overly impressed with paying in excess of $100 and being disappointed with a newer overpriced competitor. My new Braun 4775 has been in use for a month, and I'm still very satisfied. I use this model to shave my face & head, and get a good clean result. The pop up trimmer works well on hard to cut neck and nostril hairs. I would recommend this to anyone who just needs a basic no frills much better than average shaver for a very reasonable price."
4,Very enjoyable,"We have really enjoyed this fireplace insert. Although it doesn't provide much heat, unless you're standing right next to it, it is very relaxing to watch (great ambiance). Our grandchildren really enjoy it too and I don't have to worry about them getting burned as they are cozying up to it. And there isn't a mess to clean up, ever. How nice is that? This has definitely been worth the money to us."
5,Lovely and warm at the same time..love it!,"We bought this electric fireplace to help with the gas bill...plus add some ""warmth"" to our family room where the fireplace had been closed up by the previous owners. This is wonderful, looks wonderful, and adds warmth both to the family room and the adjoining kitchen, where we are most of the time! Thank you for a great product."
4,Fire Place,This product looks absolutely amazing the heat it blows is fine I just wish the motor could be stronger to blow more heat. Great for a small room.
4,WELL PLEASED,"I DID MY RESEARCH BEFORE ORDERING AND I AM HAPPY WITH MY DEAL. THE FIRE LOGS REALLY LOOK REAL AND AD SO MUCH TO THE ROOM. THE HEAT IS OK, I AM USING THE LOW HEAT MOSTLY AND IT BRINGS THE ROOM UP 2 DEGREES SO WITH THE CENTRAL SYSTEM [THERMOSTATE] IN THE ROOM IT DOES NOT COME ON AND FOR THAT REASON THAT ROOM IS WARMER AND THE LIGHT BILL WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS USUAL. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS FROM MY WIFE, SHE SAYS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 6 INCHES WIDER AND TALLER FOR OUR FIREPLACE [NOT A BIG DEAL]. READING THE REVIEWS IS A GREAT HELP IN MAKING THE RIGHT PURCHASE AND BEING HAPPY WITH IT. DELIVERY AND PAYMENT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED. THANKS, SAM"
2,Story is boring but end is shocking,"This novel is mostly rather dull. But as you get closer to the end of the story, things are not as you thought. Not a memorable read. All in all not a book I would recommend."
5,"Intelligent, wove me into its human web","Cast a spell throughout and never underestimated my experience with reading mysteries. I kept believing I understood what the ending would reveal, and it still didn't change my interest in discovering every word. A novel with rich character development. This writer tells the human tale, displaying a mature, sensitive management of the male AND female experience. Now I have to read Cook's earlier works."
4,Extremely hard to put down.,"I very much enjoyed this book. Thomas Cook has a talent for teasing you with clues as to what the outcome will be; you can't wait to find out what happened to cause the disasterous results. He also makes you feel you know the characters, only to find out they are extremely multi-faceted. I highly recommend this book."
2,odd,I got this pool for my 3 year old. The tail is hanging over and is in the way of standing. Although it provides shade the pool does not get the sun needed to warm up through the day. My boy ended up trying to jump on and hang on the tail also making me feel as though it was not so safe. Funny the tail seems as big as the pool. Photo misleading and so it the price.
2,Too Tight,I have a size 11 foot and these just won't work. Bought two packs. Opened one and the second went to Goodwill. Love Adidas shoes but will never wear their socks again.
5,Solid Sock,"I'm picky about socks. Every year or so I chose a sock and buy 10-20 pairs. I only keep 3 types of socks in rotation at any time. This means I never have to match socks.These have been my main white socks for almost 2 years and they've held up remarkably well. I don't think I've thrown out any of them from holes. After that long they don't look amazing, but I also haven't made any effort bleach or whiten them. For the price, this is a solid regular white sock and I'd buy them again."
4,"Awesome safety razor, but Edwin Jagger de89bl is probably better overall","This razor has a medium aggressiveness, so for first time safety razor users, it's actually really good. It does give a really close shave. The chrome head is pretty good looking, but no where close to as good looking overall as the Edwin Jagger de86blEdwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated. Man, that razor is just gorgeous and so well made.Overall I would suggest this razor, but I would definitely consider the Edwin Jagger first."
4,Better shave than any cartridge will give you,"Shaving is definitely more enjoyable with this old fashioned gem, and I'm getting a closer shave than I was with my old Gillette fusion. I've since moved on to a Merkur Futur adjustable to get a more aggresive shave, but I still use this one at least once a week. I found a trick to get a more aggresive shave out of this razor since it's not adjustable. If you buy half single edge blades that fit into a straight razor shavette (like Shark half razors) or simply cut your DE blade in half, then place both halves inside of the razor. This causes the sides of the blade to stick out a little further for a more agressive closer shave, and also makes it easier to get those hard to reach places such as under the jawline. The razor holds both halves of the blade just fine so you don't have to worry about the razor moving or falling out. I find that that the feather blades give me the best shave."
5,"New wet shaving convert, love this razor",I switched to wet shaving about a month ago and picked up this razor. I've been very happy with it:-good amount of weight so you don't have to apply pressure to cut through the hair.-comfortable grip.-easy to change blades.
1,Poor design that seems to hinder shaving,"The handle screw out of the base, meaning you have to take hold of the razor blade to remove and install another. Not exactly safe, because even if it's too dull to shave your hair, it's sharp enough to give you a nasty cut. There is a different style where two panels (by way of twisting the handle) open and close, allowing you to dump the razor in the garbage. This one's got a two-piece top (three pieces total) that would fall in the garbage if you tried disposing of the razor that way. You also have to hold the razor at sort of a weird angle to get it to shave and I am convinced it's this strange design that makes getting a close shave impossible. I'll use up the blades I bought with this thing and then give it to charity or chuck it and go back to disposables, any of which shave better than this thing!"
3,"The German ""Toyota"" of razors!","I bought this Merkur razor about a year ago and have been using it pretty much every other day since then. There isn't much to it, there is a handle and the two pieces between which the blade is clamped. It is a little pricey for what it does, but considering that it is made in Germany where workers generally are paid a living wage, I guess it is reasonable.The build quality is superb, each piece has a heft to it and feels really solid. It has not lost its shine even after a year of use and the blade is always centered between the two sides. I feel that this razor will easily last me another 10 years and beyond. It is totally worth it!"
3,Ehh...,"As a new person to DE it's a good first razor. You can just see poor craftsmanship all over it - the cast is sloppy.Does as advertised, but will be looking to upgrade soon."
3,Way overrated,"This razor is way overrated. It is well made and will last one the rest of his life as opposed to my old gillette which only lasted about 20 years. I do not like the weight nor the slant of the blade. I thought this would really be good so ordered enough good blades to last me a long , long time but really find a Bic is more comfortable to use. Wish I could have tried one before buying it."
4,A really great model to start DE shaving,"I'm a *big* fan of this jobber. Its high-quality build is at the sweet spot, distinctly above the *really* terrible models (Lords, Weishi's, et al) but without straying into the realm of luxury models (Future, Vision, Muhle, D.R. Harris, et al).Whether buying for yourself or buying as a gift, I'd strongly recommend getting anything less than this or an equivalent (Merkur 34c, EJ, etc), lest a low-quality razor unnecessarily turn the user off from wet shaving altogether."
3,OK Razor But Nothing Special,"I read all the glowing reviews and thought ""I gotta get one of those!"". I did. It gives an OK shave.However, I prefer the shave I get with my Parker 96 Butterfly razor. I guess shaving is a very individual matter."
4,Very good product,"I haven't been shaving with a safety razor for too long (only a couple of months), and this is the first one I've used. Now, with that in mind I can tell you I've liked it very much. It is very comfortable to use; I specially appreciate the long handle and the weight (which helps you shave). It also looks and feels sturdy, so I guess (though remember I don't have much experience) it will last at least a couple of years.Nota bene: Blades are really important, so be very careful when choosing them. Though I lack much experience I can assure you the coolest razor will be worth less without decent blades."
5,Great razor,"I've had this razor for almost two weeks and it is my first DE razor. It is much easier and safer to use than I expected. The finish is beautiful and the shave is comfortable and close. I use it on my head too, and it has been very easy to use even on the back of my head where I can't see. No nicks so far but I do take my time. I will most likely but an adjustable Merkur once I get the hang of DE shaving to get more control of how aggressive I want to shave. But I would definitely continue to use this razor for years to come."
5,"GREAT for legs, underarms and bikini area LADIES-Best Shave EVER. (PERIOD)","After using disposables for years I decided to invest in a safety razor- After reading the reviews- decided this one was the best one (since I'm new to safety razors).... Easy to use- and the results are AWESOME...Ladies, it's better than waxing...Leaves your skin BUTTER soft! I use it to shave my legs, underarms, and bikini area- yep! and NO ingrown hairs- nope! My man loves how soft my skin is- Hair free and butter soft....emmmmmmm- ditch the disposables- MERKUR is the bEST...Great craftmanship I might add! WORTHY investment!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"My friend is always bleeding after he shaves. I think he's just sloppy but I looked up this razor. All the reviews were pretty good so I got it for him. It seemed to give him a smooth shave and then a week later he stopped using it. He said it was too rough on his skin. I think it's just because he's sloppy but just be careful and slow, because it is a harp blade."
3,don't like mechanism,"While this razor feels good, the weight and balance are excellent, I expected the butterfly type opening to insert the blade. It is an annoyance to unscrew the handle from the head to change blades. If I were to buy another one, I would insure it had the butterfly type opening mechanism, especially for the premium price."
2,Long handle does not = comfort,"This was the first DE razor I purchased. I'm a big guy and I thought that the 180 Long Handle would be a perfect match for my hands, but it wasn't. Just shaving for the first time with the Merkur Model 180 DE razor I instinctively knew that razor didn't feel right in my hands. I went ahead and purchased the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C , a lot smaller than the 180, but it felt perfect in my big hands. I felt like I had more control over the razor. I purchased the 180 because it was pushed onto me by Amazon, meaning when you purchase, e.g. a shaving brush, Amazon has a section that says ""Frequently Bought Together."" Since at the time I was new to DE Razor I figured it must be a great razor, which I am sure it is, but just not for me."
2,Broke after about a year,I was happy with the performance of it but after less than a year it broke. There are two pieces that screw together and after a while thje threads would not catch so the unit could not be used.I'm looking for a better built one now but thought I throw this review out as a warning to others.
5,Ladies will love it too,"I purchased this for the guy in my life. He likes it, but has yet to try it.We're both new to wet shaving so take my review with a grain of salt. I also purchased a badger hair brush. I tried it out myself with the included merkur blade. It works BETTER on my legs then even a fusion. Takes a bit longer, but totally worth it. Shaving is no longer a chore.The weight is good, I wish it was heavier? I did want the long handle though, since both me and SO have long fingers.It's also not as aggresive as I thought it would be after reading reviews. Thats good though, since I'm still learning."
3,Great concept...structurally weak,"Shaving with a safety razor such as this one has done wonders for my husbands razor burn problems. Trouble is that a razor used in the shower will be dropped, however infrequently, and the rim which connects the blade and top to the handle was small and flimsy and broke off. As a result the razor is unusable. The moral is to treat this razor gently. Perhaps a future design will be engineered a little stronger."
2,Dangerous but close shave,"Sure it shaves close, very close. It's a razor blade, handle with care. If you're not completely awake, coherent, and patient don't use this razor. It will remove skin from your face. All razors will nick you, this type of razor will scar you. I bought this razor hoping to save money on replacement blades, it's certainly cheaper in the long run. However, it's not worth the savings if you constantly scar your face. The cheapest disposable won't cut you like this razor will. If you have lots of time and are extremely careful then this razor will be fine for you. If you're like me and want shaving to be quick and painless, then get a different razor."
5,I like it,"I just received myMerkur Chrome Long-Handled Razorand have used it twice so far. I absolutely love it. This is my first time using a safety razor, having given up on my Gillette fusion. The closeness of the shave is amazing! I am getting pretty good razor burn, but as it is only my second time using it I have to figure that my skin will grow accustom to using it. It does take a bit longer to shave, but it's worth it. I currently use it with a drug store mug soap and a cheap boar brush from CVS but I think Wal-Mart carries the same brand."
4,Great follow up,Initial package was not in working condition. Once negative review was left the seller contacted me asap with an new charger - Thank you!
3,some good information,Some of the ideas in this book is really informative. I found the book a bit tedious to read but the diet sounds like a good one and I am getting ready to start using the diet plan.
4,giving it a try,I found the diet in the recent womans world magazine. I have ordered the rice and chili on line. It was not available in my local market. Until it arrives I will stick to fruit and brown rice. I am excited to think that this will work and in desperate need to lose weight I will give it my all. I will stick with the magazine version for a week or two and then make a book investment. Your comments are great and inspiring.
1,forget it if you're looking for the SACD version,"this is an SACD alert!Despite what the title description says, neither AMAZON nor amazon market resellers are shipping the SACD version of this. I have recently discovered this the hard way. they are shipping the jewel box regular version. of course Amazon has no interest nor desire in correcting this. and to add insult to injury they charged my $3 to return it. Buggers!"
3,Not the same!,I used to play this at the arcades when I was a kid but noticed when I got this game for home use it was a little different to play.did not like the way it plays hard to control so it took the fun out the game not really satisfied such a shame cause I used to love this game!!
4,Good experience,"Quick delivery. Product works as promised. The Roady system is an easy, do-it-yourself way to get XM radio installed to a vehicle."
1,Again poor Delphi quality!!!!,"As previous efforts to access XM with Delphi, their product is crappy!! I went through FIVE (5) XM recievers, and finally cancelled my three year subscription. I wish there were other ways to access. I miss XM."
1,Disappointed,"I wish I had read the reviews on this CD before I purchased it. I, too, was very disappointed because I wanted original recordings. On most of the songs, it's apparent they tried to re-create the song like the original, but some of my favorites were quite far from the original."
4,An interesting study on Chinese's perception of ghosts,"The author conducted a survey in Hong Kong in order to study the ghosts stories Chinese Style. As a Chinese, I find his views accurate. You can read the book as a scientific study on spirits and Chinese rituals, but you can also read the book as a horror book because it included many true haunted experiences told by the interviewee."
3,They can make it better for students,"I liked this manual for quick reference during the class. But when it comes to doing homework, it should be better. At the end of each chapter there is a homework. Sometimes these drawings are labeled differently than the drawings in the chapters themselves. Also, sometimes it's hard to find the answers for the homework questions. I supplemented the info with the textbook from the same author, which would sometimes leave me in the same confusion, or I would use the internet, or the other workbook.In overall is a decent instruction tool, but some people may find it very difficult. I got A's in both lab and lecture. But I worked hard."
2,ok book,"would call this more of a fast read handbook, most of the stuff in here is known to a beginner already so i didn't find it so useful."
2,"If you like being frustrated, you will LOVE this game!","Its been a while since I've played Kings Knight, but I remember enough to warn you away from it.As a shooter, this game is horrendous. Played in a top down perspective, the screen scrolls toward the bottom as usual, however along with on-screen enemies you also have to worry about terrain features that occupy most of the screen. If you aren't constantly moving your character left to right (while pressing the fire button as fast as possible) your avatar will be stuck cutting lone furrows through the grid. As soon as this happens, chances are that you will soon be dead.Hit up YouTube for some great examples of the gameplay. Notice how easily the characters die, and how ineffectual the un-upgraded weapon is."
1,Doesn't live up to it's hype...,"I thought I would enjoy this book, especially after reading the other amazon reviews but I did not like it at all. I especially didn't enjoy the author's writing style - it is clear that this is her first attempt at writing. Johnson's current pathetic situation is a result of his own egomania - why glorify that in a book?"
2,Choppy writing - Disappointed,"I saw the story on HBO Real Sports and it looked really interesting. I was disappointed with the writing. It didn't seem to flow. The author would go from childhood and progress, but along the way, she would skip from age 13 to 15 to graduating from high school and then back to 14. It just didn't flow and I found it frustrating to read."
2,Defective Disks,"I bought this series set for my sister for Christmas 2011. The first set was defective, looked scratched & would not play. I had it replaced and it was the same problem. After reading the reviews I can see that it's not just me that's experienced this same problem (on multiple sites)."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this disc set for my wife. And although the discs appeared to be in good condition, they failed to work properly on any of the DVD players (pleural) I own. They repeatedly cut out, stalled, and had poor image quality. My wife was very disappointed."
3,Great series... but.,"I love the series, always have. I was excited to start watching it on my new (to me) dvd set!Sadly, I have had to miss a few episodes, why you ask? Because the dvds are scratched. So at least one episode on each disk will not let me watch it.Other than that, speedy delivery, and easy seller!"
1,I had planned...,"I had planned on buying this complete set until I read reviews by other Amazon.com patrons that the set was indeed NOT complete, but editted for syndication. How disappointing! I will only purchase it when it is indeed, complete."
2,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","I am an RPG fan from the days of King's Quest, and Golden sun is an Ok game. The graphics are spectacular (Of course you need a worm light to see them...)! The Story line starts off exciting and interesting, however dialogue sequences can be trapping and lengthy, leaving you disenchanted at the end of a sequence rather that getting you excited for the next section of the quest. The true travesty of this game is that you don't have the opportunity to complete the quest you set off on in the beginning of the game. Golden Sun leaves you hanging in the middle and many story points are not resolved. If you love RPG's for graphics than Golden Sun is the best I've seen for the GBA if you love the stories behind the graphics then this game isn't for you. (But check out Lunar and it's sequel for Playstation)"
5,Simply Brilliant,"As a long-time and frequent video-gamer, I can tell you: this is one to buy. It's hands-down the best game for GBA (at least for the time being), and it's among the best Game Boy games ever. Think of it as Zelda, with a splash of Pokemon, stunning graphics, and amazing replay value. With a quick-moving plot that never has a dull moment, you literally won't be able to put it down until you've beaten it."
5,The Best GBA game I have ever played and probably ever will,"There are few words to describe this GBA title. So I'll say them. Incredible, Beautiful, Fun. Incredible, because it has incredible capabilities choice wise as in like items and battles and stuff. Beautiful because the graphics are amazing and beautiful for a Gameboy Advance. This game has just nailed everything right on the money especially if you are a RPG fan. I would definitely buy this game if I were you."
5,X's review on Golden Sun,"I haven't gotten this game yet, but from what I've heard and seen, this is a must have for RPG lovers that have a Game Boy Advance. Great graphics for the GBA, a good story line, nice play control, and an overall great game. There are four characters that you can play as. The main character Isaac, who uses the power of Earth, Garet, who uses fire, Ivan, he uses wind, and Mia with water. These powers are called psynergy, and can be enhanced by small, magical creatures called Djinn (Djinni is singular), which can be found usually by solving puzzles. Djinn can also be used to summon magical creatures. Venus Djinn have the power of earth, Mars Djinn have the power of fire, Jupiter Djinn have the power of wind, and Mercury Djinn use water. I would choose a 94 from a scale of 1-100 for the overall game. I hope this review helped you in any way."
5,best game ever!,"this game is just like dragon warriors and pokemon together. just like in dragon warrior you fight by yourself and not with monsters. it is like pokemon because you have quests to be completed only the ones are alot funner, and more intresting. this game is definetly worth your money. I would have payed $40 to get this game!"
5,THE BEST HANDHELD RPG YET!,"When I got the game I thought, ""Oh, just another RPG."" Well, I was way wrong! This game is totally cool!Here's what I rate it: (1-5)Gameplay-5Music-5Sound Effects-4.5Graphics-5Addictiveness-5.5This game is so much fun you start playing at 8:00 AM and stop at noon! You play as Isaac, Ivan, Garet, and Mia. They are adepts of psynergy, a special power alowing you to summon attacks such as Earthquake, and Plasma, and Ice Horn. Adebts are those who master elemental attacks of a certain element. Isaac is an Earth adept and Garet is a fire adpet. You can also recieve small creatures known as Djinn. Djinn are creatures that control a certain element. When you attack with them then later on your next turn your can summon them to unleash a superior elemental attack!If you want a good RPG get this game!!"
3,Lets be honest here...,The game is WAY to controlling over where you are and when your there.Sure theres a great storyline and a wonderful battle system as well as the battle graphics are great.But I just find this game to controlling.Ive beat the game about 4 times now and this is still probably one of my favorite rpgs on earth.If your really into this kind of game BUY IT!!!
4,Best RPG for GBA,"Golden Sun is the first original RPG for the Game Boy Advance and thus gets overhyped a bit. Yes, it has great graphics; the best yet for a GBA game. It also has a pretty good musical score and great sound in general. However, the storyline is right out of an early Final Fantasy game. The characters over emphasize plot points through repetitive dialog (""Should we go that way? Yes, let's go that way. OK, we're going that way. So, I guess we'll go that way now. OK let's go that way now."") and the only real surprise is the ending which happens too soon and doesn't really resolve anything (because it's to be continued!). Still, it's strangely addictive and you do care what happens to the characters. All in all a very strong RPG that's almost perfect."
5,Wonderful,"This game is a wonderful RPG for the GBA. The graphics are the best that you can get on the GBA. The game is a little slow going. It can take three or more hours to complete one quest because you have to do three more just to get the first one done. But that is the great thing about a good RPG, it should take a while to beat. Plus the puzzles in this game while not hard are challenging. One of the pillar puzzles is a pain just because of the water drip. This game is just the begining. The continuation of the game is Golden Sun: The Lost Age. If you're going to get this game you better get GS:TLA as well. This game is great for those summer vacation days or really long car trips. Time just seems to fly by while playing. Golden Sun is one game that all GBA owners should have."
4,ok game,"i got this game 2 days ago and it is pretty cool. the story line is great, the characters are o.k, and the graphics rock. my friend told me about it and it seemed cool so i got it. my tips if you want to buy it.....1. if you like LONG TERM games.2. if you have money for lots of batteries.3. if you like rpg (because it is)."
5,VERY Addicting Game,"If you are a RPG game fan,I almost garentee you will like this game. The storyline is addicting and the graphis are awesome! The music is good too. I would not recommend this to younger kids,but around 12 and up. The instruction manual goes a little too much into detail and may seem to make the game confusing. The game is very fun!!5 stars!!"
4,The Best Original RPG on the GBA Bar-None,"While there have been a lot of ports of some fantastic SNES RPGs on the Advance system, there hasn't been any original titles to take advantage of the Advance's powerful specs. Enter Golden Sun, which has graphics that probably couldn't have been done on a Super Nintendo and a storyline that gives Breath of Fire a punch in the stomach. Nothing will come close to this game till Final Fantasy Tactics."
3,"Golden Sun, is it worth it",This game is ok but it's some part's of the game that don't make sense. And at some part's in the game you won't know what to do. but if you like adventure game you sould get it. If you don't want to have to go all the way to a village from a cave. DON'T I repeat DON'T buy this game
5,The Best Game of 2001!!!,"I can't believe this game wasn't on the list of Best Games of 2001 for GBA!!!! This game is awesome. I used to have a Sega Genesis and my favorite game was Shining Force, and guess what, this game is similar, in fact is more elaborated than SF, and according to reviews, it was done by the same people. I can't wait to hear when Golden Sun 2 will be available, first one to buy it hopefully, because the saga continues.... It took me a whole month and few days to finish it, and the ending is very good."
3,golden sun seems like just another final fantasy,"this game looked good, it got good reveiws, but then when i played it i didn't see what was so special about this game.i also thought the music was soothing(this is good for a love theme,not rpg).The graphics were just okay.it gets really frustrating somtimes.its not an easy game.all im saying is rent before u buy!!!!lol."
3,"Good RPG, but a little strange.","Golden Sun is arguably one of the prettiest and best GBA games ever seen. I can definately agree with that. However, I could not stand the dumb story line. You start out living with your depressed mom and act like children pretty much all the way through. Supposidly these guys are teens, but Nintendo clearly aimed it toward an everyone audience. I would have liked to see some profanity, and characters that actualy acted like teens, rather then moms. Oh well. On the bright side the visuals are great and the battle system is original. It just depends on how old you are and what your likes and dislikes are I suppose."
5,advance wars,"great game lots of chater verity. Good game if you want batle action, stres,and head acks. But even after all that thier is tons of play time and intersting bosses. I wated all sumer for this game and it was worth the wait!"
3,"Tahirih, Qurrat al-ayn","It is rather difficult for me to write a review at this time. I am reading the book in connection with another book about Qurrat al-Ayn by Sorya Adembaken. This last book was published in Berlin last year. The title of this book and its subtitle are: Qurrat al-`Ayn, Eine Studie der religiösen und gesellschaftlichen Folgens ihres Wirkens. I hope to be of more use to you at the end of this year. C.Nijland"
2,not very sturdy,Its not as sturdy and strong as I was thinking. It gets the job done but all of the work has to be done by the user. Needs a lot of force and strength to get the job done
2,Flimsy,"This doesn't crush cans completely, only down to about 3/4"", so the crushed cans take up more space than necessary. You have to finish them off with your foot, so you may as well just do that to begin with. The side pieces also bend rather easily. Not recommended."
1,Terrible,"This product is incredibly flimsy, and only lasted several hundred cans before becoming inoperatable. Get a crusher with a solid handle, as this crusher's handle is easily bent, requiring a lot of time fixing and a little time crushing."
1,Cheap.,"We had two of these break off in one week. It could not withstand the water pressure and plastic tabs that hold the chrome part to the inside part broke off in the middle of a shower twice. Word to the wise as well. Delta universal fittings aren't so universal. They're ""universal"" to the same product style, but don't necessarily work with other Delta product lines. It's misleading to claim their universal when they're not even compatible within their own brand."
1,Poor Quality,"I had a similar experience to two of the other reviewers. The faucet was installed 11 months ago. While taking a shower, the faucet literally blew off the wall. the weak point are two tiny screws that hold the plastic insert in the faucet. They both sheared.I have had the faucet replaced with the same model. Hopefully it will last longer."
2,audio cuts in and out not true HD,Save your money its not true HD the audio will cut in and out esp on xbox360.good if your looking to sell cheap crap on ebay i guess but sellers get ripped off on ebay keep buying from amazon.
5,"Perfect, simply perfect","I love Luis Miguel, and this selection of music was exactly what I needed, very upbeat and in the style only Luis Miguel can deliver."
5,Luis Miguel - Another success with Navidades,"When I first heard Luis Miguel would be releasing a Christmas album, I must admit I was not thrilled. Now that he has, I can't believe I ever felt that way. He has compeltely taken classic Christmas songs in English and turned them into beautiful villancicos that are sure to become classics in Spanish. He's done for Christmas songs what he did for the boleros. His voice keeps getting better and better, if that's even possible. I can feel every emotion along with him on each song, whether it be an upbeat song like ""Frente A La Chimenea"" (Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer), or a beautiful hymn like ""Noche De Paz"" (Silent Night) complete with a gospel choir in the background.I recommend this to anyone who wants to be filled with the Christmas spirit. It certainly has done that for me."
2,The title doesn't fit,"I liked Brook a lot, and Mallory was much more appealing than I had expected from earlier novels in the series. He came into his own here. The new Lord A'Court was creepy but had no real teeth. The true villain didn't work well. The plot was weak, sketchy. Brook's mom was certainly odd. The author did an excellent job of bringing others, especially Tipton, back into this book; it was nice to catch up with them.I liked the book fairly well, but it wasn't as good as the rest of ther series. I'm giving it two & 1/2 stars."
1,"A Maudlin, Self-Pitying Read","This must be what the male version of a ""chick flick"" is like. I found myself zipping through the book breathlessly but was ashamed when it was all over. Nick Seafort is a self-obsessed, self-pitying egotist and I don't think I could contine further with this series.I've read my share of space opera novels and I get Feintuch's nod to Britannia's Navy. But when you have a repellent vision of the future, your hero needs to be engaging and not sucked into that system.Feintuch writes well enough to keep the improbable plot developments moving but it's not enough to save this sappy male soap opera."
2,Like A bad traffic accident....,"you can't help but look. Feintuch has a knack for creating thoroughly unlikeable characters who wallow in self pity and ooze self righteousness. Yet you can not help but finish the book, and the ones that follow, all the while hating yourself for not having the strength of will to put them aside and move on with your reading life."
2,Didn't live up to the billing,"A great idea to be sure, but to me it didn't live up to being the ""Hornblower"" in space saga that I was hoping for. I really couldn't suspend disbelief in the story, and never got to the point of caring about the main characters."
2,Pan Rusting,"Not satisfied with this product. Half of the pan is rusting. I would not have purchased had I known. I purchased a Faberware pan at the same time, and it is in perfect condition like the first day I purchased it."
1,Never Used and Already Rusted!!!,"Purchased the muffin pan assuming it was made of aluminum. It is not aluminum rather it is made of tin! Nowhere in the listing is the type of metal listed. (The seller might claim that the title of ""Muffin Tin"" states the metal type but this does not sit well with me.) When I received the muffin pan I took the brand new pan and washed it. The pan rusted only after one washing and was never used. When I requested a return from the seller the only response was ""we are sorry to hear that, but please remember that anything that is made out of tin requires a thourough drying to avoid rusting.""Do not buy this pan as it is not durable and be wary of a seller that knows the products they are selling is inferior and will not stand behind the items they are selling!!!"
5,Really Cute,This is so cute. The kids love playing with this. The pieces are just a little smaller than I'd like them to be (have to keep an eye on them so they don't get lost). But it's really nice.
3,Lots of Pieces,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for our grandchildre, ages 3 and 5. It is quite durable and they are having fun prentending to make and eat pizza. The only compliant I have is there are way too many extra pieces of toppings. My daughter put quite a few of the extra pieces in a storage bag and put them away, as they had pizza toppings spread all over the house. Otherwise it's a great and durable toy."
5,Great replacement knobs!,"This is an original Gibson Gear replacement part. Don't change your knobs or any kind of part in your Gibson (Les Paul, SG or any other) if not for the real deal. I have a Les Paul and I definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts. Besides, they look great and will perform their job for many, many years!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Joel McCrea made only a few good westerns. This is not a very good one. When Masterson became a law officer, he was about 22 years old. McCrea was 54 when this film was made. A film can be good, although it does not follow the facts, but this does not succeed as a fictive western. The love element was not very persuasive, either. McCrea is symphatetic, of course, but that is not enough. This is quite lethargic film."
4,Loved this movie,"I loved this ""Love Actually"" style movie. It has everything. Over the top Bollywood storylines (Salman Khan & Priyanka Chopra's storyline), heartbreaking tales (John Abraham & Vidya Balan and Anil Kapoor & Juhi Chawla's stories), and romantic comedies (Govinda & Shanon Esra, Akshaye Khanna & Ayesha Takia, and Sohail Khan & Isha Koppikkar's stories). The music is great. The performances are wonderful. And it doesn't feel like and over 3 hour movie. Plus the film introduced me to Priyanka Chopra, now one of my favorite stars."
5,A complete and utter STEAL!,"The price has apparently risen since the last review, but it's still a steal! The performance is on period instruments. Several recordings here are among the best out there, such as the first Quator (much sweeter than the well-known Musica Antiqua Koln issue), and all three overtures are well done. This is a very competitive set.For a moment, I'd like to address the place of Telemann in music. So often he is denigrated in favor of other composers. I will admit that Bach is greater, but I find Rameau and Handel to be his equals, and it makes me cringe every time people rank better than him the predictable and repetitive mass that is Vivaldi. Vivaldi wrote some lovely pieces (such as the Recorder concertos), but many more ordinary, homogenous pieces, however new and influential his style was. That criticism can hardly be leveled at Telemann, each of whose pieces is somehow unique.If you want to be a Telemann convert, the Tafelmusik is exactly the place to start."
2,"Greatest concert perhaps, but bass overdub kills it","I agree with the other reviewers here that the playing on this disc is exceptional and one of a kind. However, the Mingus overdubs which compensate for lackluster bass sound quality in the original are plodding, poorly equalized and seem disconnected entirely from the group. I would much rather have forgone the bass altogether for the ""original"" master tapes to keep the integrity of the group."
2,Beware!! Expensive with poor quality!!,I've owned this dryer for about 2.5 yrs. It worked great up until one day somehow the fan got dislodged and made a noise. I'm sending it in for repair. Have to pay $15 s/h fee for warranty which I think we shouldn't since its already expensive as is. And seems to have poor quality.
3,It's ok,I wanted to be able to bring the story of Santa and Jesus together for my 3 year old. He loves reading this book... but it's just santa telling the story of Jesus' birth.
4,Book is easily understood by preschoolers,"We chose to buy this book because our daughter had it on her wish list.Yes, we would recommend it to others."
3,Good concept,"Great idea for a story, but I think it could have been written better. Aoki should have written more about Jesus' birth and why Christmas is about Him."
3,"A Solid, Mildly Entertaining Entry Into the Ultimate Universe","I've been a fan of the Marvel Universe for a long time, but had never really gotten into the characters of Daredevil and Elektra. I was aware of them, but had only seen them in guest appearances on other comics. Perhaps that skewed my enjoyment a little.The artwork is very good, and the writing is tight and well-done. The characters all feel realistic and genuine. So why the 3-star rating?Something just feels slightly boring about this book. Again, it could just be my lack of enthusiasm towards the titular characters, but I think the pacing is a little slow at points. The action picks up tremendously with the introductions of Bullseye and the Kingpin though.Overall, I recommend giving it a read, but it's not a must-have."
4,Answered all my questions about Hatchepsut,"I would recommend this book to any one who has an interest in this Pharaoh in particular,or ancient Egyptian history in general.Joyce A.Tyldesley has written an interesting and easily understood book.I look forward to reading more of this author's books in the future."
5,Acoustic guitar/western ballads,"Mr. O'Brien is one of the most accomplished guitarists I know of. The music on this disc was so impressive I have bought two others since then. The recording is excellent, very clean with every nuance clearly audable. I like western music, and ballads. (Would like to hear him play some of the Old Celtic ballads), and am a student of guitar. If you like ballads of any type, or well played guitar, you won't be dissappointed with this."
2,Very suspect,"This really seems a lot like the manual, just in a different format. It's of very little use by itself, unlike the manual, however. I consider this to be a grand waste of cash that could have been spent better on a different book. Rats."
1,Droll,"The author must live in a fantasy world where everyone has as much time as they need, as much patience as they need, and jobs that are so over simplified that a script could be written in 10 minutes that would complete replace them.Is this written by Adobe? Is this what they expect us to do with their software? They need to get a clue. Why is it that other books offer insights, while this ""official"" book makes such a potentially exciting product seem so mundane?"
2,Mixed at best,"The major attraction of this book for me is that it was free, since the local library had it. :P It's not really designed in a way that enables new users to understand the appeal of this program. AFter this book, it seems easier even for ME (with zero artistic talent) to just plain learn to draw with a pencil. Well, Illustrator 9 has GOT to have more practical uses than what this book would seem to imply, so I'm going to try other books."
2,Just OK,"My daughter is not thrilled about the train. She rarely looks at it. Perhaps, other children would love this toy more. It didn't work that way for us."
4,train blocks,"I bought this for my 3 yo who has autism. He found putting the train back together very frustrating. And without a photo, I even had a tough time. If he were able to let go of it looking exactly like the picture he would have more fun."
4,Taught my toddler how to fit pegs threw holes,Good functional toy. It helped our 15 month old figure out how to stack the blocks on the pegs on the trains. After that he was able to get this basic idea with other toys he has. It looks very nice and he keeps going back to it. My only concern is if he falls on the toy as it is wooden and hard but he does have decent balance these days.
5,Melissa & Doug Stacking Train,This product is in great condition. It's a very durable toy. I would recommend this product to my friends. I love that it's made out of wood. This product arrived in a reasonable amount of time.
3,Not Great ...,This product is not so great. I like bought it as a Gifted Item but don't like the product at all. I would suggest that you have a look into the product from some store and then Buy it.
3,Pieces don't fit well together; frustrating,"Ok, so I'm a little spoiled by Springbok puzzles. I was really excited to get this puzzle, but it let us down. We worked about 1/4 of it and put it back into the box. It isn't so much that the puzzle is difficult (as I like that in a puzzle). It is more that the pieces don't fit well together. Even when the two pieces connect there may be a gap. So, it can be difficult to determine whether the pieces actually go together. It is definitely not a puzzle you can hang on the wall as it will fall apart as you try to move it..."
2,Goes overboard,"Since this is science not literature, I have to give this one a thumbs down. The author reduces all creative and intelligent enterprises to sexual strategies. Can't the joy of creating and the thrill of discovery be their own ends? Is every work of literature and every piece of music a mating call? I dont think so."
2,Same content as covered in the book,"If you have the book Eat Right for Your Blood Type you have the same content that is in this book. This book features the Type A lists. Little additional information is given regarding the diet in general. Since I had already purchased the book, I was hoping for either more information, or an enhancement of the chapters I had already read in the book. For me, this wasn't what I had hoped for. If you are wondering about this book I would simply buy an inexpensive used book instead of this particular kindle format. I felt extremely disappointed in this repackaging of previously published material."
5,Type A Blood Group diet guide,"If you're an A type following the Blood Group diet, this well-organized little volume will help you choose right when shopping or in a restaurant."
4,Helpful,"I got this as my husband has been on the diet for a few months. The original book was published 14 years ago and food choices have changed quite a bit. This was helpful for me to find allot more 'benificial' choices to feed him, but still didn't answer all my questions. Like what the heck is 'seatrout' sold as in a grocery store. There was lots of very good information, with more detail than the original book."
4,Interesting,"I am still in the process of reading this book, but it is a very interesting concept. I have found that I am not the category that I want to be in, and have made changes in my diet."
4,A concept revisited,"I rejected this book some 10 years ago. Owing to health issues I bought a new copy and wish that I had given it the credence it deserves at that time. It is well written, simple but informative in its information and excellently presented. The book is a tribute to the depth of knowledge that Dr. D'Adamo has."
1,Blood Type A Food; Beverage and Supplemental Lists,"I'm nearly 70 years old, and the diet described by this book for my blood type has absolutely no appeal whatsoever. I've been relatively healthy all my life, and can't see that what I've been eating has had such a detrimental effect on my well-being."
1,Completely useless,"I bought this book because I wanted a sourcebook that would help me resolve my claim without involving a lawyer, something the book's self-review promised it would do. However, the book was cynical and insulting, and every other line said, in effect, ""if you INSIST on doing this yourself, good luck. However, you should really get a lawyer."" The book's title should be ""Get a Lawyer for your Personal Injury Claim."" That's about the only message I got from it. What a disappointment."
4,good monthly planner,"I like the size of this book, but do miss having the plastic sleeve in the back to hold loose papers, receipts,etc."
4,"EXCELLENT BUT BE CAREFUL, O SOLE MIO is NOT HERE!@!","RECORDED IN 1999, BRINGS CARUSO TO LIFE, BUT SOME SONGS ARE NOT THAT GOOD, NOT NEEDED, BETTER GET 2001 CD, HAS O SOLE MIO!"
4,NICE LARGE CASE FOR THE PRICE,"NICE CASE BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS CASE IS THE OUTER SHELL GETS PUNCTURED OR DAMAGED KIND OF EASY. IF YOU WILL BE STACKING ITEMS ON IT OR MOVING IT AROUND OFTEN WITH YOUR OTHER TARGETS ITEMS ETC, IT COULD GET SOME WEAR DAMAGE. BUT OVERALL ITS GOOD. I BOUGHT TWO OF THEM."
1,No drain as advertised...,This pool does not have a drain in the floor as stated! Why is it so hard to find one with a drain? We use it every day and having to deflate the pool every night to drain the water and then air back up the next day doesn't make sense to me and is a real pain.
3,"Good, but no drain- a pain!","The one BIG drawback is that there is no drain in the bottom of this pool, even though it sid there was. You have to let the air out a little to deflate it to drain it. A big pain. I love the inflatable bottom and thought it was colorful and durable enough. My 3 year old loved jumping in it!"
2,Warning: Description is wrong,"Description is incorrect. There is NO drain plug, and draining water out of this pool is VERY difficult."
4,Another Ravel gem!,"When I ordered this, I thought I would be getting the suite that I had in my collection years ago. I was initially disappointed that this was the complete ballet. Having listened to it, I am quite pleased. This is Ravel all the way--and that is a good thing! I don't think I need the suite."
4,Worth reading but dry.,"Mortimer J. Adler did the world a favor by writing about the great books and getting a liberal arts education out there for anyone who wanted it. These books of his are worthwhile information and i would recommend them, but they aren't exactly page turners. You really have to be in the mood to learn and improve yourself academically and this is a good springboard. Like I said, it's pretty dry."
4,"A Few Errors, But ESSENTIAL!","If you're using the McQuarrie textbook, let me first say I'm very sorry to hear that. However, one thing you can do to make your life a little better is to get a hold of this solutions manual. I would say having this manual is a MUST if you want to do anywhere near decent in a p-chem class using the McQuarrie book.The solutions manual has worked solutions to all problems - not just even or just odd problems. Another nice feature is that it also restates the problem in the solutions manual. This may not sound like big deal, but when you see the the size of the McQuarrie textbook (thicker than a phone book!) you get tired of lugging the book and solutions manual around. So if you have a quick homework assignment to turn in and want to take the easy way out ;) you can just use the solutions manual only and not even bring the textbook to wherever you're going."
2,Not worth it,This book is not worth buying unless your professor takes examples directly from the McQuarrie textbook. The solutions are not as detailed as they could be and there is no table of contents or index information. If you're looking for worked examples to study from you're better off just searching online. This book is a waste of money.
4,Much better for my needs than Ahearns,"I disagree with the reviewer who negatively compared this book to Ahearns. Unlike Ahearns, Lee's book provides complete descriptions and points for the books he covers, enabling you to feel very comfortable that you have correctly identified the first edition. I do mourn the limited list of authors and books and would appreciate a guide that combined Ahearns comprehensive list with Lee's descriptions, but at least Lee provides me with some guidance to the most popular 20th-century collectibles"
1,Terrible!,It's criminal what this book sells for. In my opinion it's barely worth the paper it's printed on. Author list is very limited. Identification and grading information is elementary and can be found in any of the far superior guides such as Ahearns or even Book Finds. I intend to stay clear of this author AND publisher.
3,Has Potential,"This is an album with great artistry. But it could really benefit from some better production. It sounds compressed, and almost mono. I have to admit I was a little dissapointed when I got this album. I got it with high hopes because the total science tracks on Drum&BassArena; were by far the best- 'Give me your love' and 'No. 1 Sound'. The latter sounds horrible on Good Game, but awesome on Drum&BassArena.; It could partially be because the one on Good Game is a remix, but isn't the best mix usually reserved for the studio album?In any case I think many of the tracks are great- 'Big Man,' 'Kiss Chase' with Jenna G, and 'Ask Not' run through your head after you've heard them. They just need to be produced ""bigger."" I believe that's the only thing standing between Total Science and popularity like High Contrast has that reaches to the United States."
5,Romantic!,This is wonderful. It's got a nice selection of songs that will have you singing along in no time.
1,No drain plug,"Despite what is written in product features this pool does NOT have a drain plug. I was specifically looking for a pool with a drain, which is one of the main reasons I bought this one. We have to drain and refill this quite often for my 2 year old and now it's a big hassle because we end up deflating the pool to drain it then we have to pump it back up when it's time to swim again. Wish I hadn't thrown the box away or I would be returning it."
1,Pool DOES NOT have a drain plug,"I wish I had read the other reviewer who rated this 1 star. The main reason that I purchased this was the drain plug feature, and it is non-existent. I am currently attempting to return this to Amazon.com."
5,CUTCO IS AMAZING!,"Cutco knives are the most impressive cutlery tools ever. It's silly to buy any other knives because Cutco has the FOREVER guarantee. If the knife ever breaks or needs repared, Cutco will do that for free. They also resharpen the knives for free, all you have to do is pay shipping. And although I just mentioned resharpening, any of their knives with the Double-D edge will last you between 7-10 years, cutting like new every time. I know at least 50 people that own Cutco, several of which have owned Cutco for 40-50 years! And they are still the originals, but they know if anything ever goes wrong with them, they can practically replace their entire set for free! I hope this helps! If you have any questions ever, e-mail me at bbarks22@hotmail.com.PS-If you want to know how to get Cutco cheaper than here, e-mail me too and I can help you out! ;)"
5,A Game Designer's Dream,"How do you sum up a book that is both a Universal Role Playing Game and a tool for designing the same? Amazing! It would require a bit of work for the Game Master to start up a game, but once started (and you could always choose GATECRASHER or any of hundreds of online pre-fabricated worlds) anyone -- and I do mean anyone -- can play this. Using a simple adjective system to describe the various capabilities of the characters allows even the most basic beginner to get a handle on the character quickly. The book includes many helpfull hints to get you started in any type of enviroment, as well as a plethora of notes that aid in changing any and all aspects of the basic framework. Mr. O'Sullivan - I tip my hat to you, sir."
3,"Cute, but Silly!","My expectations were met. It's a very silly cd, but my 4 year old and 2 year old love it. It's a clean version to all songs, and the lyrics are easier to decipher than the real thing. My oldest daughter has been singing nonstop since I gave it to her. It's hard for me as an adult to listen to it...but then again, it's not for me!"
1,BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"If it was possible-0 STARS. This cd is horrible. These ""Kidz"" totally [messed] up the real version of the songs. If the actual version is so terrible for the little children's "" tender"" ears, then they shouldn't listen to it at all. But once their older, they'll see what a [mess] it is, and wonder why their parents let them listen to it. Remember, this is a waste of money and plastic. So DO NOT BUY IT-it ain't worth it. If your kids want to listen to older people music, don't chose teenybopper, but CLASSICAL or BARNEY. Don't let your kids listen to this screwed cd."
1,Try Not To Break A Rib Laughing.,"The only good thing about this CD is that it makes a perfect frisbee.It is a complete waste of plastic.It is pathetic.After hearing that 12 year old girl group Play,I thought ""it can't get any worse from here"" and ""record companies can't get more desperate than this"".I found out that I was wrong when I heard Kidz Bop.This is nothing more than a desperate attempt for the record labels to get rich.But instead of the original performers singing the songs,we get a bunch of four or five year old.Well.....at least this is a good comedy CD.If I could have given this CD less than 1 star,then I would have done just that.Do not buy this garbage.It is another scheme for the record labels to get rich.Peace Out."
3,A perfectly adequate Doctor Who book.,"There are so many ways that this could have been an outstanding novel that it's frustrating: the core plot is gripping; many of the characters are fascinating; and the imagery and ideas are wonderful. So where did it go wrong? The story leans FAR too heavily on the past. It seems that barely a page goes by without the authors making a ""clever"" reference to a televised story or previous novel. They even go as far as including a footnote for a previous novel. Another problem lies in the TARDIS crew. Fitz shines, but the Doctor gets tortured yet again while Compassion does a credible impersonation of someone with absolutely no personality whatsoever. The biggest problem, though, is that I never bought into the main threat of the book. Frankly, it says a lot for how well-written this book is that I came away from it entertained at all, something that is a sore diappointment after reading the vastly superior _Interference_ and _The Blue Angel_."
4,X2 Rules!,Let's cut to the chase. If you are reading this than you must like good music. Listen to the sound clips and than buy this CD. These guys can play!!!!!
5,"Amazing, thorough, though dry history of labor","I read the 1963 edition (4th printing) of this book (ex-library) and while it is a dry read, it is a very thorough and complete history of labor in America from colonial days until the mid 1950's. It is a good foundation on labor in America which can then be continued on and reflected upon to today's modern world and the old issues of back then, while forgotten by many people today are still highly relevant today in today's working world. This book should still be the foundation for any future reads on American Labor Union history. Just go into it that it is biased towards Unions and other books bring out blemishes in this timeline. This edition was also a book of its time (late 50's early 60's) and has some lines that are considered racially insensitive today."
5,Magic Sliders 22-25 mm Grip,"I had purchased these from Bed, Bath and Beyond a couple of years ago. However, I couldn't find them so I goggled the product and found it on your site. I have used the Magic Sliders 22-25 mm Grip on all 8 of my chairs and on my counter stools. They allow me to slide my mom - who is an Alzheimer's patient and needs a bit of help. They also eliminate all the noise on the tile from the stools. It's a win-win situation. I am very happy with the product and the ease with which I was able to locate them at Amazon."
2,elbow grease required,"The only time this thing has been clean is the day i took it out of the package. On the plus side when i first put it on the camera it did not affect the image any which is great, but it was not long before microfiber cloth, lenspen, nothing worked and i am careful. The only thing i found that sort of worked was cleaning with distilled water and then wiping with a cloth for about 5 minutes, buyer beware"
4,"Blood Type B Food, Beverage and Supplement Lists","This book is concise, great for people who don't like reading heaps of explanations. It tables the specific information on food groups and beverages for Blood Type B. It clearly lists the most beneficial foods for my grocery shopping list. I live in Australia so a few products aren't available, but there are plenty more to choose from. Great resource!"
2,"Doesn't stand up in cold, dry weather","This may work fine as a moisturizer for those who live in warmer, more humid areas. I live in Chicago and this moisturizer does not stand up during the winter months."
4,Georges Fenton à son meilleur,"Après avoir composé la musique de Anna and the King, George Fenton s'attaqua quelques temps plus tard à The Blue Planet, un documentaire de la BBC sur la vie marine. Georges sut ici nous donner une merveilleuse partition, remplit de grands moments. Après une fabuleuse ouverture (The Blue Planet) et des morceaux raffraichissants tels que Sardine Rin et Spinning Dolphins, l'album semble s'essoufler dans la partie médiane, avec des morceaux servis à la ""simili-musique-pop"". Quoi qu'il en soit, un retour en force est assuré pour la finale. Il s'agit ici d'un album sympatique, avec de surberbes passages, où George Fenton se donne à coeur joie avec une liberté quasi-totale. Le tout vient dans un boitier de couleur bleuté, question de s'y sentir encore plus! ;-)"
2,Catty....too much,"Yah, no. Not a horror anthology AT ALL. A few are good stories, none freaked me out or made me jump when my cats came in the room. Dissapointed. Possibly good for a spooky geriatric reader."
4,"""The Colonial Angler's Manual""",An excellent book for the person wanting to re-enact historical fishing or for the one just interested.
4,One of Lindsey's best!!!,"Brave the Wild Wind is one of Lindsey's best in my opinion. It is dramatic, and their is a easy rhythm to the book that makes it almost impossible to put it down. Great work."
2,very disappointing,"I am not going to get into details about the plot. All what I can say is as a reader of the genre, I found this book lacking of character development or depth. I could not sympathize with any of the characters,. The heroine is seriously deranged who goes around hitting men, and the hero is lame with no charisma.I know it is not very constructive of me, but I have no more time to waste on reviewing this book, I wasted enough time reading it."
3,Sparks fly....,This is a story of young women who finds herself running the ranch after her father dies. Her absentee mother returns to the ranch with her young son and a handsome stranger to turn her calm life upside down. This book reminds me of early Janet Dailey. If you are looking for standard romance novel this would good choice or Johanna Lindsey's current novel A Loving Scoundrel.
3,Very deep and detailed,"I don't suggest attempting to read an entire assigned chapter. It'll take you forever b/c there is so much detail. Instead, first look at the ""Key Concepts"", ""In Summary"", and ""Understanding..."" sections first. Then, go back and look at the sections you don't understand inside the chapter. However, I found myself going more to my microbiology and anatomy/phsyiology books for a less intense explanation."
5,Dean Jones at his hilarious best!,"""The Shaggy D. A."" is quite possibily one of Disney's Best films. When they bring in a respected actor like Dean Jones with an all-star cast of comedians; you are bound to get one of the funniest films ever made. A movie the whole family will enjoy without all the garbage that is so prevalent in movies today."
2,"Not the best, expected more from Freud","I bought this to install a counter top edge trim with a ""T"" barb. I didn't have very much to do, less than 36' feet, so I was a little surprised that after about 10' the bit was dull and basically burning its way through the wood. I was using it to cut into 3/4"" AC plywood."
1,A ridiculous title for a ridiculous book,"The author disregards the womans viewpoint as if womens bodys are the property of men. He paints the entire Democratic party, Democrats individually, and the courts and the media as all wholeheartedly favoring abortion which is of course ridiculous. He fails to draw the parallels between protection of life in the case of abortion. old age with that of the massive amount of innocent life lost in the failed and bogus Iraq war. Al in all a book for the true believer who doesn't want to think or see anything that he disagrees with. Pathetic really."
5,gamer since 1988,This is a great Mega Man game because you get a nice Mega Man story at the beginning. You must stop Mr.X who has taken over the robot tournament. Plus in this game you merge with rush to form Jet Mega Man and Power Mega Man
1,Disappointing!,"In my opinion, this book simply furthers the author's agenda of promoting homosexuality with a candy coating. It is very disappointing that the author would write a children's book with women holding hands in public in China. Anyone adopting from China knows that single women adopting need to have heterosexual statements notarized and authenticated. Lesbians are strictly forbidden to adopt from China yet the author doesn't explain that these women in her story deliberately falsified statements and lied to China to get a baby. I am seriously puzzled why this content is found in a book about Chinese adoptions if not for the sole purpose of promoting acceptance of homosexual couples raising children."
1,Very sad!,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is adopted from China, and I wish I would have taken the time to read the book reviews first. I am sad that my money went to support a book that is clearly more interested in promoting homosexuality than honesty, as homosexuals are not allowed to adopt children from China. Eventually, I suspect the Chinese government will make a decision not to allow single women to adopt because of a few dishonest individuals who choose to disregard the government's requirement that homosexuals not be allowed to adopt. This will result in many children being denied the opportunity to have a forever family. I hope those homosexuals who disregard China's law and pursue the adoption of Chinese children will remember the possible consequences of their actions."
3,Good But Slow,"I loved the plot, the characters, the descriptions, the truthful content of this controversial book. But I found myself wanting to skip chapters at a time to get to the real plot. Lamar took a little too long to tie the main characters together, but overall I enjoyed the book, and I loved the ending."
5,A unique book that strives to reexamine a facet of American History in a new light,"Anthracite Lads: A True Story of the Fables Molly Maguires is a unique book that strives to reexamine a facet of American History in a new light. In an era generations gone by, a group of Irish coal miners were dubbed the ""Molly Maguires"", and labeled ""Red-Handed Murderers"" by the press for their alleged role in bombings, assassinations, train derailments, arson, and street demonstrations that rocked Pennsylvania coal territory. The popularly perpetuated history is that a lone, heroic detective infiltrated the notorious gang and brought them all to hangman's justice; now, Anthracite Lads sheds the light of modern scrutiny upon long-buried violence to reveal heretofore hidden truths. A gripping narrative, Anthracite Lads is grounded in extensive research yet reads almost like a novel, and features a special section with reproductions of Molly Maguire photos and original documents."
5,History Is A Wonderful Teacher,"Anthracite Lads is a wonderful piece of history. It is both a page turner and a piece of incredible historical research that demonstrates a lesson that has not changed in decades. Burke's thesis that the Mollies were set up by big business and found guilty in a biased media has more than vague comparisons to recent events. The big business has shifted from coal barrons to oil barrons and the media has largely shifted from print to electronic, but the lessons of the mollies live on. Prior to the publication of Anthracite Lads, our publishing company had Burke's book reviewed by a series of top historians and their reviews have been enormously positive. It is a pleasure for Erie County Historical Society to make an academic contribution with this story and a double treat to provide such a good reading text. Burke is a talented story teller and a tireless researcher.David Frew, Executive DirectorErie County Historical Society"
1,Very strange book,"I checked this out from the library and didn't preview it before I started reading it to my almost 5-year-old. Fortunately, I self-edited as I read it and eliminated the references to the ""devil's"" imp. Even before this came up, however, I was dismayed at the parents' negative attitudes and relationship with each other. I was able to use it to point out how people shouldn't behave and shouldn't talk to each other. We won't be reading it again."
1,An Inappropriate book for children,"This book is awful. I thought this book was scary and totally inappropriate for children. The father gets mad and threatens to join the navy and hopes to drown and then his body is taken over by the devil and he is turned into a lump of coal. The daughter goes and tells the mother, but the mother accuses her of making it up and doesn't listen to the child. Then the same thing happens to the mom,who is turned into a blue egg. The only thing that saves them is that the daughter cleans the devil's baby and the whole house. The messages being given out are terrible."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"This video was completely the opposite of what I thought it would be. My husband and I always watch the Travel Channel and see these exciting shows about cruises and that's what I thought this was. I almost turned it off after the first 10 minutes. It's basically a slow-moving documentary about a Carnival cruise, narrated by a monotonous voice that never shows excitement. Most of the people on the cruise don't look very excited either! I am trying to decide which cruise line to use when my husband and I go on our cruise and this DVD made us very wary of using Carnival. I wish I had saved my money and just continued watching the Travel Channel. At least it's entertaining."
3,Kept me watching,"The film follows the early life of Goethe up to the point he becomes a famous and revered writer. The young actor who plays Goethe is charming and engaging and the story is fairly true to Geothe's real life. I would have liked to have more time spent on understanding why Goethe's story of Young Werner so captured the hearts of his fellow countrymen. Alas, this question is never answered which leaves me wondering what the point of the movie was? Watch it if you want to see a biographical depiction of young Geothe, if you are looking for more analytical information regarding his popularity - you won't find it here."
2,Choose a different NYC guide,"This guide is too condensed. There is not enough information to plan your trip to NYC! The maps are poor in content and lack many of the needed information. The sections of the book give general information but is not specific enough to help you decide what sites to take in. I suggest choosing another guide that, eventhough it may be a little bigger in size, will give you more information about New York."
1,This is old: the next-gen set is same price and better,"The Panasonic TH-50PX60U is out, and is selling for the exact same price as this, and is better in every way."
1,horribly tedious...,"Boy, was this book a pain! I had to slog through numerous detailed examples of creating user interface graphics and buttons before ever getting to animate anything. That book is wayyyy too detailed and focused on one application - creating a UI for a ""rich application"" web site. Also, the book is often inaccurate, especially for Mac users. I was ready to forget about Flash forever.Instead, I bought ""Macromedia Flash MX 2004: Hands On Training"" by Rosanna Cheung, and it turned me totally around. I can't believe how much difference a book can make in revealing the beauty of a piece of software. It starts right out with animation, and it is aimed at the right level of detail (at least for me). Also, it has very effective sidebars to thoroughly explain concepts as they come up, so it can be used as a reference (unlike the other book). Thanks, Rosanna!"
4,my first metalcore album,"This was my first metalcore album, I first picked it up at a hot topic don't know why I was in there but I listened to it in the store and I got chill bumps I love the anger in metalcore in evergreen terrace whenever you feel like screaming let them do it for you I leave it in my cd player."
4,"Pretty good, but not perfect","This crimper is well made and does a great job. It has a comfortable grip and a ratchet to help ensure enough force is used. When used with the matching connectors it allows you to work much faster then before while making fewer mistakes. The only real issue is that it does not always cut all of the excess off. It usually gets almost everything cut, but the excess at pins 1 and 8 usually remain attached by their jacket and have to be wiggled or snipped off. It really does not slow you down much, but it can get frustrating at times. The wire cutter / stripper combo built in to this crimper leaves a lot to be desired. It function fine enough for someone making a few cables and most pros will have specific tools for each task so it is not really an issue.One interesting feature that will help those that don't make patch cables on a regular basis, engraved on the tool is the location of pins 1 and 8 and the color code for both ethernet wiring standards (T-568A and T-568B)."
5,New condition.,Just getting started with this book. I really enjoy this author. The book is in new condition. There is a lot to learn about Sacred numbers.
3,Warcrap zapie overpowered stuff,The spells and classes here would unbalance a game not set in the Warcraft world I suggest downgrading the power of some of the spells and classes at your own discretion.
3,Metal Gear,Buy this to add to your collection if you also own PS1 and PS2 so you know the full story line of METAL GEAR.
4,An Illustrated History ROCKS!!!,"Puffy AmiYumi has done it again. I love this album. I am planning to get it for my birthday. My favorite song is Love so Pure. Its low harmony sounds unforgettable. You should buy this album. Different remixs of songs and the sweetness of the new melodies make this album a hit. Although I am mexican-american, I love the Japanese duo. My parents don't like them which,kind of makes it hard for me to get one of their cds. Anyway, this a Awesome album and i hope everyone will get one"
3,Very listenable (and forgettable),"Chameleon-like groups who can churn out any style to order---from samba to singalong to anthemic rock---very soon tire the ear. Still, Puffy make no pretense of high art or anything like that; their music is semi-silly fun, and you'll find yourself humming the tunes at all kinds of inappropriate moments."
3,Good cheap shirt,"I wouldn't want to pay a lot for this shirt, but at a single-digit price, it gets the job done."
5,Excellent,"Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Año"
1,misleading,Shirts that were shown on the internet were not anything like what i received. The opening at the sleeve showed it just went around shoulder not half way down the chest. This was my first time buying from you and will never buy again.
2,Too thin,"There's hardly any fabric to this tank top. I was expecting heavier material -- instead, it looks and feels more like a tee shirt."
4,Basic tank,"I like to work out in these. They show off your guns when you're not at the gym, and when you are they provide freedom of movement, air flow to cool yourself. They're a 50/50 cotton poly blend, some mislike but I find they absorb less sweat don't wrinkle, shrink less than 100% cotton, require no special treatment to maintain. I also favor these over the dri-fit poly shirts that fray and develop a nasty smell. Nothing fancy just your basic tank. Oh yeah and they're inexpensive, you can buy a number of them so you always a have a clean one if you work out frequently."
4,good inexpensive shirts - no all are %100 cotton,"I've been looking for muscle shirts for a while. I finally came across these ones which were pretty cheap. I ordered black, white, gray, oxford, and red colors. It seems that the gray and oxford colors are NOT %100 cotton. They are only %50. The rest are %100 cotton. I tried returning and purchasing new ones a few times but it seems that this is the way it is. I contacted Amazon support and they couldn't guarantee that I'll receive the %100 cotton - I don't quite know what is the deal.Anyways, the shirts are also oversized - I initially ordered large which was too big for me. Medium fits well even after laundry/dryer."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"I really like these shirts, especially for the price. I ordered larges & am 6' 165 lbs. They fit nice & look good on me (according to my girlfriend!). These are great for working out or running around on the weekend. I even wore the Blue one out to a casual dinner with some cargo shorts & felt comfortable."
5,Adorable,This book is great whether you are into buddism and sheep or not. You can learn a great deal while being entertained by these comical illustrations depicting the messages. It's a must have.
3,"Assortment is OK, but save your money","I bought this impulsively, but was slightly disappointed with the product 'kit'. I think if i would have gone to my local outlet, I could have got the set for less. This is not apparently one set from one manufactorer but seemed to be various items put together as a 'set' from Amazon. The item for sterilising the jars is enormous - I don't have have a pot big enough so I cannot use it unless I buy another gigantic stock pot. the Muslin is OK - but quite frankly i could have bought it from a haberdashery - it is not anything more than a square of fabric. the funnels are too wide for the Quattro Stagioni jars I use, so i could not use them; this is why going to a store and checking everything fits together first makes sense. I don't think i will buy kitchen items again through Amazon as it all looks a bit different in real life than what i thought."
4,A little better than OK,"I received this order within 2 weeks. All of the items were in good shape with the exception of the wire rack. One of the supports was not soldered/welded, making one handle come apart. This piece is flimsy and completely useless without the welding. Thankfully, I already had one. This being said, I have no other complaints. All items work well, and I fine the lid holder quite handy."
1,"Buyer Beware - A real rip-off, buy individually and save money","I decided to start canning the veggies from my garden this summer and went to Amazon to purchase all the things I would need. When I saw this product I thought, ""how convenient - all the accessories packaged together"". When I purchase a package like this I expect that I am going to save a little money as compared to buying each item seperately. NOT SO. If you want the products in this package, buy them seperately and you will save $6.67 (as of June 2012). Granted, it was not even $7, but the whole reason I decided to start canning was to save money. These items were literally thrown together into a plastic bag and for that convenience I paid an extra $6.67. I feel like I was just ripped off and I hate that feeling."
2,Way too short,The content of the documentary was good but I was very unhappy with the length of the program. It was less than 25 minutes long. The product description never gave the length of the DVD. It was priced as a regular DVD price. I understand it was a TV program but expected it to be closer to an hour.
5,Rowatinex,"Excelente service, very fast delivery, but very expensive if you compare with Germany, there Euros 5,00 !!ThanksMaris"
5,great cd!,"In my opinion,this cd is best to listen to while reading, meditating, relaxing and dancing.It has a fast paced tempo, and a vocal that blends with the music. It is one of my favorite CD's. I hope my review has helped you! =)"
2,Not that good at all....,"I bought this one online after reading 2 such previous rave reviews(& I'm a big fan of LG), but I've definitely ended up regretting buying this one bcs. there really wasn't anything memorable about this one at all....(If I end up liking a romance novel even mildy, I re-read it at least a couple of times, but with this one, I've never bothered to read this one more than once, & that says it all....)"
1,Rotten.,"I enjoyed the previous animated feature, ""Kong: King of Atlantis"". That one was animated the old-fashioned way - nothing revolutionary, but pleasing enough. Plus the story was kooky fun and the songs were decent.This one is CGI. Some of the ugliest CGI I've seen since the early '90s. It's so rotten, you may not even be able to focus on the story. I know I couldn't. I almost suspect that the studio got through with the pre-viz animatic and ran out of money, then decided to just release the pre-viz and pretend it was SUPPOSED to look like this.Keep an eye out for the surfer dude - I forget his name - I could stomach him in ""King of Atlantis"", but in CG form he is possibly the most hideous character design I have ever seen. Supposed to be one of our heroes / comic relief, but as a CG character he is a bulbous monster that will haunt my nightmares.Your kid has seen better CG animation in a cereal commercial. Your kid will be embarrassed by this garbage. I was just disgusted by it."
2,BORING!,"I am an enthusiastic ""Lienista"" and own a number of her recordings, but this struck me as a lukewarm rehash of her studio work. I found very little new, performing live didn't seem to spark anyone to daring musicianship or creativity, and the recording's miking/ambience gave me the feeling the audience was barely there and barely awake for the most part. In all, I found it dutiful and ""workmanlike."" Skip this one and grab up Baba Yaga, Stone Chair (AL playing as part of Bukkene Bruse), and Prisme -- real Nordic soul music! (This one goes to the used CD store down the street.)"
3,Why spend $40-70 on a re-mix CD(s),"First of all let me say KILLING JOKE rules ! ! But even the most die hard is not going to spend that kind of money on a bunch of re-mixes !I'm sure the re-mixes are better than the original ! But come on, its too much to spend on an impot !"
3,Must We Defend Nazis?,Well written. I disagree totally with the author's rationale. They are off base and do not make sense for what they are arguing against.
1,Not what I'd hoped for,"Perhaps my idea of Italian is too Americanized, but this music was not what I had in mind to play during a dinner party. Sorry. Didn't like it."
2,Not the Denise Austin I know,"This was not a typical Denise Austin workout video (and I would know, I've done most everything she has put out since the early 90's) moves are repetitive, - your up, your down, your in every position and nothing flows. I got so tired of T-stand I just stopped doing it. Since opened videos are non-returnable, this one will go in my yardsale pile."
2,"Too many repetitive, hard repetitive t stands not for begiiners","I thought it was helpful only slightly. Denise does not make it easy to burn your abs. Constant t stands, standing on elbows,toes repetitive."
5,GREAT post pregnancy Abs strengthening DVD!!!!!!!!,"LOVE THIS DVD!!! This is everything I hoped it would be and more! The workouts are slow and controlled yet challenging enough but not exhausting. I can feel the workout in my tummy muscles when I'm done, and have noticed a huge difference in my tummy strength and appearance. Doing these exercises several times per week has returned my post pregnancy (separated) tummy muscles to a tight and supportive condition. I am soooo thankful that I purchased this! Denise Austin teaches a specific and very effective exercise in one of the segments that tightens the tummy muscles that become weak during pregnancy, That's exactly what I needed! I look forward to this workout every day since I started using this DVD. Denise Austin is professional and fun!! I would recommend to everyone. I would also recommend another of her workout DVD's that I love and use often called ""Pilates For Every Body."" These are some of the BEST!"
4,"Fresh, objetctive point of view.",This book is a good reference for understanding the history of Argentina in the late 60's and early 70's. Gillespie has studied the period and offers a fresh and objective view about subjects that are fertile territory for political manipulation.
3,Game freezes,"I have only tried to play this twice since I got it, but both times it has frozen in the middle of the game. Kinda frustrating! But o well, I guess what can you expect from a 20 year old game?"
3,First streetcar history of the El Paso system.,"The late Henry Leinbach's 1976 El Paso ELectric Company Transportation Division, A Tentative History, is a landmark work concerning electric street railways in El Paso, Texas. The fortunate thing is that Henry started this work in the late 1960s when he had access to interviewing many of the people involved in the system. El Paso electric streetcars ran from 1902 to 1974, first by the El Paso Electric Company, later by El Paso City Lines and the city of El Paso. The book is written for the trolley fan, is comprehensive in terms of equipment used and routes. There are a few honest errors. For example, the Mesa line is shown as going north on Kansas Street when it actually was on Campbell St. Overall, the only streetcar history available since the seventies, well worth the money."
5,This book taught me a new living,"I was given this book in 1995 (version 2.5) and it taught me photoshop in a week abouts. I CANNOT recommend this book to enoght people. It will TEACH YOU THE PROPGRAM, and not how to use it like a vehcile for ...plugins. Photoshop is an amazing tool, this shows you what all the bells and whistles and some tricks too."
5,Always puts a smile on my face,"I saw YMSB for the first time this summer at Delfest, and have never heard a more wild and satisfying jam in my life. I can't compare this album to their others because this is my first. I searched Amazon for an album and selected this one b/c 1) it had the longest jams on it, 2) it included ""One Hit...,"" and 3) they do a cover of ""No Expectations"" by the Rolling Stones. I have been listening to the album constantly ever since, and am amazed at the musicians' ability to make quick and smooth tempo changes, and their overall musicianship. As for the jams, they flow through 4 songs in a row seamlessly. I find myself really happy when I listen to this album! As for the Stones cover, it is not possible to exceed the perfection that that original song is: nothing can compare to Brian Jones' sublime slide guitar playing. But it is possible to come close. Really close."
5,My choir,I actually sang in this choir. It is composed of youth all across the globe. We enjoyed recrding this album. I also sang on the album (AME Zion National Mass Choir) That is one of the things I look forward to every year at our Winter Meeting.
2,"Why no vegetables , fruit, or herbs?","I have not found any vegetables, fruit, or herbs mentioned in this book. Since many can be grown indoors and eating is one of my top priorities, I am disappointed in this book. After all, the word ""Complete"" is in the title. However, it is a beautiful book. I bought this book on Amazon and relied on their webpage."
4,Good beginners,"Has all the basic info. I have 21 house plants and 12 varieties. This book covers all but three. The section on Palms is pretty basic but does not cover the palm I have and it is one of the most common. If you are looking for information on specific palms this is not the book, but they do cover a general topic on palms and talk about a few specific palms. I would recommend this book, it has basic info, water, fertilizing, type of propagation, trouble shooting; and a big sec ion on everything you need to know on house plants, from potting to nursing a sick plant; it even has a heart felt section on how to say good-bye to a dead or terminal plant"
3,Very Powerful bullet but...,if you get addicted to using this it will only last 3 months if your lucky it does break very easily... so if you decide to buy be very careful not to tug the wires too often unless you will break it... other than that I really did love this little bullet.
4,Klein has his own thing,"Guillermo Klein is a composer. These are not tunes set up as vehicles to blow on,and they do require your attention. As with much beautiful music,these compositions do not reveal themselves in one listen.Instead the listener will be compelled to listen and listen again. God bless him.This is not to say that I loved every track. One or two sound to me to be rather ""exercisey"" and at times,the way he repeats melodies in round like fashion is a bit too much for my taste.On the whole however, the music is surprising, full of life and Kleins own unique arrangements are sublimely original and soulful.Also, ben Monder has a terrific solo (somewhat buried in the mix) on an absolutely gorgeous composition.(track 6)The music seems to flow from track to track and the album to my ears seems like A THING,rather than a bunch of ""things"",unrelated. God bless him again...cant wait to hear more."
2,kodak cheap and not so easy share,"OK, The unit is ok for a beginner, but get used to being frustrated by the control button....it doesn't usually work the first time you press it. The zoom feature is pretty useless, not much zoom. The transfer software is a piece of crap, your screen resolution will triple and you won't have functional control of your start menu...once you exit the program the resolution returns...this is annoying. The picture quality is ok, but forget the flash, light a match instead...I am suprised that kodak got so cheap with this camera, i am keeping it for another year, then gonna look at a non-kodak product...it's a kids toy"
2,Frustratingly slow and awkard controls,"This cannot be a serious camera by Kodak, it just can't. First: the controls are so small, you need childrens fingers to operate them (expecially the power button). Then there's no timer. Then there's no lens protection. The thing is agonizingly slow - don't expect to take a snapshot in a snap, this thing has to 'heat up' for 20 seconds or so... The battery (rechargable) lasts only a photo or 50 at most. So take your charger with you if you go on a holiday, as two normal AA batteries (wich you can also use)lasts no more than maybe 20 pics... Half the time I had to take batteries out to 'reset' because some features wouldn't work. But hey, the software is quite ok. Place the thing in the dock (optional) and your pics are autoloaded into your PC. But that's about it. So, even as a beginning digital photographer, go for a better one."
4,great book,"We both really liked this book. Some of it seemed a little dated, and some of the tips seemed a little corny- but overall well worth the money spent. It sparked some great conversations about our LRD and how to best manage it."
3,it's okay,"It's okay, I like it fine, but a lot of it is really just stuff you already know. Communicate, don't break up over the phone, and so on. If you want some reassurance that couples do survive long distance woes, then buy this book. Lots of testimony from couples who made it."
2,what have you done with the real eddie?,he was obviously rushed by the suits to get this one released!! if you have never heard him play(keys & organ)trust me wait for his next release
4,Well.....Not a MUST HAVE toy.....,"To start with, this is not a MUST HAVE toy....here are the goods and bad of this toy.Bads:-Too much tiny assesories-The dogs look weird-a 'Kinda hard to open'dog house-Rick clothes are so unfashioned.....-Dog leash dose not stay on-If you move EVERYTHING falls down, and you end up picking them ALL up AGAIN.Goods:-Enjoyable-Good to waste your time(By taking out those tiny winy assesories, and puting on the rack takes a loooong time)-There are two dolls and two dogs instead of 1.-pretty dog houseWell, overall, if you want to waste your time on somethin, this is the one.It;s really fun though......you can race your dogs change polly's clothes and stuff....Hope this Helpes!!Barbie Fan"
2,"Well, at least the costumes were nice","I've always disliked period films that take inspirations from the 21st century. It doesn't work and its annoying. Modern music does not belong in any period drama. Having said that, the movie itself actually has a very modern feel. But that is because Kirsten Dunst is in it. She is not believable in the least. However, I really couldn't get enough of all those costumes. Gorgeous and unbelievale isn't even enough to describe them. Probably some of the best I've ever seen in any film. At least the movie looked pretty. The barely-there plot doesn't really help it. It was just sort of an odd movie that happens to be visually stunning. I'm sure there are people that would love this type of film, but for anyone looking for a real film on Maria Antoinette, look somewhere else."
2,For the young of mind,"Reinterpretations of past events/people/plays can be good... e.g. Romeo+ Juliet (1996). This film, however, is for the young and impressionable.The film ""looks"" great, but it is devoid of wit and good dialogue (which made the French ancien regime, if pathetic, at least fun). No one TALKS to each other in this film! Why must so many new re-interpretive films lack good dialogue? Are WORDS to difficult to use these days? (see Pride and Prejudice, 2005 as another example of this trend) Like the world in which we live, that which is serious and compelling is reduced to a music video or a magazine advertisement.It could have been a good film... the soundtrack is fun but little else. If you're a vapid teen, you'll love this film because there nothing to THINK about... but there's loads to LOOK at."
1,dont buy it,"I love historical films, but not this one. Its empty and boringDo not waste your time and money."
1,BLUE HIGH TOPS?,"THE MUSIC DIDN'T GO WITH THIS MOVIE...IN ONE OF THE MANY SCENES OF SHOPPING, SHE'S TRYING ON SHOES AND THERE'S A PAIR OF BLUE HIGH TOP SNEAKERS AMONG THE PERIOD SHOES. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? JUST DIDN'T GET IT!"
4,an awesome period piece,"as a student of costume history, i originally did not expect much from this movie. happily i was so wrong. everything from the lighting, attitudes, costuming, and props were so correct!! this film honestly gives the feeling of what it must have been like to live in the world of mid 19th century French nobility. kudos to sofia coppola, kirsten dunst, rose byrne, and the rest of the cast who do an excellent job of portraying French life among the nobility of the 18th century. Will watch again and again."
4,Marie Antoinette Is Queen Of France!!!,When my mom rented this movie for me from Netflix I thought that Marie Antoinette was a good movie. There was a part in the movie I was I disappointed that they didn't at the end of the movie is Marie Anoinette & King Louis being executing to death having their head s chopped off.I was like sying why they didn't show the Execution To Death of Marie Antionette & King Louis in the movie?And Kirsten Dunst for didn't did such a very bad job protraying Marie Antoinette.Well Done Kirsten Dunst!
2,"Visually Stunning, Yet Lacking in Substance","All right, I'll admit that the costumes were spectacular, I'll even admit that the acting and directing (what little was actually necessary) were quite good. I'll even admit that the movie itself wasn't that bad. But there is a point where subtlety is a wise choice.This movie was totally disjointed, lacking in substance, and less than subtle (the entire movie pretty much completely brooded on whether or not they would ever be able to have sex). Add that to a scattered and completely unexplainable punk rock soundtrack, and you don't have the winner. I'm sorry, but this movie just wasn't good. However, the visuals alone were almost worth the price of admission, which is why I hazarded two stars instead of one. But unless you're in the mood to go to an art gallery or something, I'd stay away from this one."
2,Pink Fashion Magazine,"Marie Antoinette? Yes...She loved shoes, dresses, and patisserie. She spent a lot!Bye bye"
2,Trite and self-indulgent,"Only two stars from me for this bust of a film. The inappropriate and distracting punk music, the tennis shoes that appear in one scene, and the dialogue that is most un-18th century, made this movie painful to get through. What we have here is a self-indulgent romp from the spoiled Sofia Coppola. This film was far more Pretty in Pink than Marie Antoinette and really could have been set in any time and any place. There is nothing here for lovers of historical dramas. Keep your children away from this confused mess of a film."
1,PITIFUL ACTORS IN PRETTY CLOTHES...,"This film was a disappointment even by today's very LOW standards. There was no dialogue of much consequence to speak of and the soundtrack sounded like some kind of horribly regurgitated 80's punk for kids album that would not have made the grade even in it's rightful era. This obvious and poor attempt to make this film cutting edge by adding an awful soundtrack are only the beginning of this film's heroically comical deficits.When you watch the ""making of"" feature you see how this whole disgrace happened and it's too sad. I agree with other reviews that the book and this film bear no relation save in name only. The only star is given for the set, costumes, and props some of which were re-used for different shots and therefore NOT like the real french court at all. Marie would have never used the same fan twice, let alone one that was not stunning to begin with. This film is a joke and works better as a super weak comedy than a historical drama!"
2,Let Them Eat Crow,"I'll make it short but sour. Simply put, Marie Antoinette is a failure on every level. Its flat, unimaginative script is exceeded by Kursten Dunst's ghastly, monochromatic ""performance"" and a motley supporting cast, many of whom honk their lines in a twangy, totally inappropriate American accent. A badly written, badly made, badly directed egregious flop by bambina Coppola that seems to live up to as Francis Ford Coppola's unspoken motto: ""Keep nepotism in the family."" Give this one a wide pass."
1,Valley Girl,"First, nothing about Marie Antoinette or her life could be recognized in this movie. Second, it was an attack and a subtle threat to Valley Girls. Please sit with your teenage daughter if she watches this and made it clear that in this society it is LEGAL to eat cake and have a pedicure. The producers of this movie based on tbe intro song find it against a ""standard"" to buy a great cake and get your toe nails done.I'd like the producers to be hauled into a Senatorial probe. Why can't Valley Girls buy lots of stylish shoes, eat cake, and have pedicures?"
2,Beautiful to look at if you can stay awake,"I just watched M. A. this afternoon with a friend. The scenery and sets were gorgeous, but the pace dragged. The parties and foxhunts and the like were way too long. I fast forwarded through much of it. What were they thinking when they put that horrific music into it? It was jarring and so inappropriate. There was no acting to speak of, no script I guess. There were times when we waited for something to develop, but nothing ever did. And I don't want to look at anything sweet for the predictable future. At one point I really expected Marie--all of them, actually-- to fall down sick with sugar poisoning. Dunst, while very beautiful, looked and acted more like a pink cream-puff than a queen who should have been the picture of elegance.I think Elena Maria Vidal's review was dead-on and beautifully written. I will look for more of her reviews."
3,Gorgeous but story is lacking,"This movie is breathtakingly beautiful. But considering the subject, I felt there was no meat to the story. It is a costume bonanza but missed the opportunity to make it something more."
4,Let them eat this film,"Sophia Coppola took a piece of delightfully constructed non-fiction and transports us faithfully into the world that only existed for a select few in the 18th century. It is a crazy ride.The critics didn't care for this movie. I think they were wrong. I think that it is colorful, yummy, and it in fact is an intelligent commentary on the Paris Hilton life of our days shared by a frivolous, privileged few.The critics hated the sound track and generally disliked the casting choices. I say let them eat cake. Let them eat this delicious mille feuille pastry of a film, gooey with pink fondant."
1,Preview review only.,I wanted to see the preview of this movie before i bought it. I love how the free preview consisted of the opening credits and no movie bits....
3,Oooooohhh preeettyyyy!,"The visual aspect of this movie is so profound that you become drawn to the details; the tastes and smells, eye popping costumes and stage design have you on an artistic high. However w. every ""trip"" there becomes a point where blocks of time/ information become amiss. I'm kinda thinking it's what she wanted us to do but the Director, left me scrambling through the pretty images in my mind to seek something MORE- a plot, a theme or some underlying story, that just wasn't present in the direction. Overall, i was inspired and entertained, not by the acting or the historical value of this piece, but the theatrical fashion show aspect of it all."
1,Incredibly Boring,"I usually don't watch chick flicks but I gave this a try while recovering from wisdom teeth surgery. It was awful! Boring to the last scene. I would prefer to poke my eyes out before watching this again. Guys, run away from this!"
2,A disappointment,"It does an OK job humanizing Marie Antoinette, whose villainy has almost become a cliché in history, but the movie is nevertheless dry and very often tedious. The accents are all over the place, a few actors sound American and contemporary, others sound British, and none of them manage to convince us that they are in pre-revolutionary France. Although the customs would indicate otherwise, this is not really a period piece. It has a certain modern sensibility that could be interesting if it didn't clash so badly with most of the tone of the movie. Marie Antoinette is not as bad as the critics said, or as the horrendous trailer seemed to indicate, but overall it's a disappointment."
2,"Beautiful costumes, no plot, little charictazion","A beautiful picture of and why the french revolution happened. Not!!!!!This is an eye fest for folks that like the 17000's;it is beautiful and elebrate. But for story, and resulition,its now where. We never see her head choped off--just her implied love of her husband.A pretty film with no fubstance."
2,Poorly designed printer,"I like this printer most of the time, but I've become upset with one very poor design flaw: black-and-white printing is disabled unless the color ink cartridges have ink in them. As their website says, ""Q: Can the printer still print if an ink cartridge is expended or not installed? A: No. The printer will not operate if any cartridge is expended or removed. It's best to always have extra cartridges on hand."" With this bizarre design, not only is it best to have extra cartridges on hand, but necessary. If you run out of any color ink, you can no longer print in black and white--very inconvenient."
1,Deceptive Ink Ripoff - Never buy Epson,"Recently my ""low ink"" light went on in the middle of a project. I was not too disappointed - in fact I felt a bit smug because I had just purchased a half dozen black ink cartridges at a good price over the internet! So I changed cartridges and went on to continue my project. But the ink light was still on! I took out the cartridge, shook it, reinserted it over and over. I went to the Epson website to get a new driver. The new driver allowed me to see my ink status. The black cartridge was full, but the color was empty! In fact all 3 of the colored cartridges had suddenly become empty! How could this be? I'm WAY too cheap to ever use color! I inserted my new black cartridges into the colored slots. No luck. Total loss. Trash can time. I will NEVER buy from Epson again."
1,Useless,"This brush is a joke. I have short, thin to medium hair, this brush does not begin to penetrate them to have an effect. It glides over, rather than through, my hair, doing nothing. It does not merit the name brush, maybe it could function as a soft wax spreader for polishing cars."
5,Fun for the guild,"My guilds name is ""Order Of The BuffaloHead"" and we had a little meet up in February, everyone got one of these for fun photos! GREAT FUN!"
4,Lovely and Peaceful,Title fits the description! I just didn't like having Ava Maria on it as it then makes it sound like the holidays.
3,"Good music, except for one thing...","I tend to agree with another reviewer-this is not really bossa nova, though there are elements of it here. My issue with this album is that I don't care all that much for the vocalization in the songs. Sometimes it works, but for the most part it just doesn't and it borders on truly irritating at times. I dislike both Eddie Monteiro's voice and style (he's great with the accordion, however). In fairness, I'm not sure I'd like anyone's voice with this music. This is good jazz that would be great without the vocals."
1,What a waste,"What a waste of real talent by an assistant professor of history. Great writing style. Very readable. BUT, lacks objectivity which is so important when writing about historical figures. His take on Gen. Longstreet is ancient, stale, and is almost comical in view of the reams of information now available which are not tainted by LOST CAUSE rhetoric. This is inexcusable for someone who professes to teach history. It shows a superficiality and lackadaisical attitude towards the subject and a willingness to sacrifice accuracy to the almighty dollar. I guess bashing Longstreet still sells . . . in spite of the facts."
4,"Good, not great","This is an adequate replacement for the original hose.I believe the original hose had wire spiraling around it to give it strength. This one appears to be all plastic, but with a ""faux wire"" appearance. The result is that it is lighter than the original, but it will kink if you get a twist in it. The original never kinked.Despite that, it works well as long as you keep an eye on any loops and get it straightened out before pulling on it.I was surprised by how much the old one was leaking -- there's much better suction from this one.For the price, I can recommend this hose."
5,Central vac hose,"The hose is great, more supple than the 10 year old one I replaced and more modern shape to the end that fits into the wall outlet. Works great!"
2,monster party pooper,"i bought this game per the request of my girlfriend. she apparently had fond memories of playing it as a child. in my time with the game i was unimpressed by it. the game was repetitious and really graphically unappealing. in a possitive note the game was a little humorous. humorous when it was trying to be like fighting giant fried foods, and at times when it wasn't, like the rest of the time. even for these funny moments i would not recommend this game."
2,Cheaply made but My Son Likes it anyway...,"This is a cheaply made sleeping bag. It is very thin material and won't keep your child warm outdoors. The carrying bag is just red and I was disappointed that Spiderman wasn't on it.The only saving grace it has is that my Son loves it. I recommend you find a different sleeping bag.All the best,"
5,Quik U killed,"Every person has a soundtrack to there life, for me it's been the stuff Quik puts out. All his albums have given me a profound enjoyment of beats, lyrics and all things related to dope a$$ music. From Quik is the name, to Trauma I felt them all. In my eyes dude can't do anything wrong. I've never heard him drop anything wack and it won't ever happen. Get this album if you love AMAZING music. And to the Quiksta himself I say ""thank you"" for all his albums... but this one especially cause I thought he was retired forever. Keep doin yo thang Quik, you'll blow up eventually. I'll keep buying your stuff!!!!"
2,He needs to Call R.kelly for Help&also get G-One,"DJ Quik is a cat I have always dug as a Producer&Artist,but His Pretenious ways done got in the way of His Music making.""Rhythmlism"" is the last Album of His that I dug&that was basically part 2 of ""safe+Sound"". that sound back then had something to do with His Boy G-One on the Bam Board with the Fmaous ""Triangle Groove"". that is missed by me.Quik is all over the place without a real banger IMO.if you gonna comeback then He should have called up R.kelly to hook Him up with a cut since on that Do Or Die Album he Name Checked Kellz.Quik can trip all he wants on Suga Free but they made a tight team.I Miss the fun&good times.Quik's Albums have been a Blur of the past few.from ""balance&Options"" onward there ain't been alot ot get hyped about.don't get me wrong for my Money Dj Quik in terms of Hip-Hop Production is right there with Dr.Dre,but sadly He just ain't bringing it the way He use to."
2,aiight,"this album is good. The song he did with Game is the best song on the album. But soley based on the fact that each song is only like two and a half minutes long I only give this cd two stars. C'mon Quik, spend more time in the studio and make longer songs goddamn it."
3,Trauma for da brain,"If you call yourself a fan of DJ Quik, you should feel required to listen to this album. It's wonderful."
5,VERY GOOD,"THIS IS ANOTHER WESTCOAST BANGER, I HADNT LISTEN TO QUIK FOR AWHILE, BUT AFTER THIS ONE I THINK IT PUT HIM BACK ON THE MAP. PLUS I FORGOT HOW GOOD OF A PRODUCER HE WAS, HE COULD BE UP THERE WITH DRE. PEACE."
2,Stupid camera work. Works well for Karajan's ego.,"No quarrel with the musical properties of this DVD. All four soloists are in a stupendous form of voice. But why is the filming team concentrating so much (to a disgusting exaggeration) on Karajan's hands and movments and by=passing the singers at theirs most glorious moments ?Is it because of the Karajan cult ?Take an example of the filming team stupidity:""Liber scriptus"" - the mezzo-soprano solo, instead of the camera concentrating on her, the camera is 'searching' for faces in the female choir, but the female choir is silent at that passage, so why ?Take the Dies Ira - the camera abandons the solo-quartet and goes to Karajan's hands instead of showing the climax high C - 'property' of Leontyne Price and the other soloists at the peak of that passage.Too much of Karajan and too little if the singing quartet.We have had enough of ""little-Herbert""; we need the broader picture."
4,"Good product, fast delivery, high price","I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a pretty steep price for some very simple metal trim. But, that said, it looks good and arrived very quickly. I give them a thumbs up for carrying it, since, like the other reviewer, I couldn't find this stuff anywhere."
3,The next En Vogue roll-out.,"They performed a cappella at my workplace and they sound really polished. Their harmonies are flawless. I believe they are produced by the same team that produced En Vogue, and the similarities are highly apparent. The music arrangements are full and strong with heavy beats, the way R&B should sound. However, the lyrics of most cuts leave a lot to be desired -- shallow and typical of today's R&B. The girls do have talent, though, and we'll be seeing more of them."
1,Confusing users manual,I received the JessEm Mast-R-Slide on 8/26/07 ... but it took me over a month to get it installed on my new DeWalt 746 table saw. The pictures and words in the User's Manual are confusing at the least ... and wrong in at least 2 places. Because I had to cut the front and rear rails of my new saw ... I was nervous and very careful. Aligning the unit is also an excercise in frustration because of the poor user's manual. If I could do it over ... I would not have purchased this item and ruined my new table saw.
2,Overrated,Am I missing something? Where are all these stars coming from? Only 50% of the time does this book address my questions. The book has a ton of information but is almost unusable for the average researcher. Be sure to review the book in detail before purchasing to verify that it has what you're looking for. The glossary is virtually useless. You'll spend a lot of time searching for your answers. Bad usability.
2,Ehhh....,"Just save your money and get a macro lens. I'm not saying that these don't work, just that they won't be great. Save that $20 and start working towards a dedicated lens for macro work."
2,Degrades images,"I got this set to use with my Panasonic Lumix G1 and 45-200 lens. The first thing I noticed was the filters were filthy (about par for cheap filters). Also, there was a spot on the +1 and a big smudge on the +2 that would not come off. I was able to autofocus well through the filters.However, the image quality degraded when using the filters. It was the equivalent of losing resolution--going in 1:1 showed blurry pixels instead of crisp ones. I asked for a refund and got one from the seller. If you care about image quality, try another brand. Right now, so far so good with the Tiffen set.Rating: two stars because it is functional."
2,Not all that lengthening and flakes onto face!,"I was very disappointed with this mascara for 2 reasons: it did not lengthen as much as I had expected and the fibers flaked onto my face throughout the day! Covergirl Lash Exact lenghtens just as much as this one does, but without the flaking - and at a much cheaper price!"
5,Even an amateur can hook this up!,"My Norcent DP-220 Dvd came in today. I unpacked it & plugged in the three cordinating colored plugs, put the batteries in the remote & five minutes later I was watching my favorite movies. Works well with my burned back up dvds too. I like it a lot & the price was definately a bargain."
5,New day has Come SACD,"The cd is great anyway but the sacd version is stunning clear, so if you have a sacd player or playstaion 3 with a hdmi connection to your amp,the 2 channel and 5.1 channel mix sound far better than the compressed cd version."
4,"Wonderful performance, terrible picture...",This is my favourite recording of Le Nozze di Figaro. The soloists are great and the orchestra too. But I did expect the picture quality to be a lot better than this. Hello DG! The DVD isn't cheap. The sound is OK though. It's still worth buying if you want to enjoy an absolutely georgeous performance of a true masterpiece!
5,Showdown: Why China Wants War with the United States,This is a book which tells me the real danger of Communist China.
2,poor value for money,"we ordered this for our son for a school play. The quality was poor, with one of the corners of the collars being sewn into the shirt. No quality control in this product, which says it is a Disney product - if so, Disney don't care about product quality. It was a poor quality product at a high price of $49.29 including shipping. Unfortunately with the school play real soon, we can't ship it back and find another one in time."
5,Love this bouncer!!!!,"My son absolutely loves this bouncer. Whether it is to just sit in and listen to the music and feel the vibration or fall asleep. I have washed the seat cover and it did not shrink or fade. It was just as soft as when I first got the product. The recline to tilt position is great, but the buttons are a little hard to press. This may not be such a bad thing, because if it was to easy when a baby moved or you lean on the seat it might just reposition itself. Hope you enjoy this seat as much as we do."
3,Poor construction,"While my newborn enjoys being in this seat and seems very comfortable, I have been unhappy with the construction of the seat. The buttons are constantly getting stuck, making it unable to adjust the seat to upright or change the volume on the music."
4,Perfect Day or Night,"Our 2 month old has been using this bouncer since we brought her home from the hospital. I love the way it snuggles her in and the vibration seems to soothe her. She takes most of her naps in this bouncer. It even went with us for our first family getaway. She slept all night in it as if she were at home in her bassinet (no problems). My major problem with this bouncer is that it isn't very portable. If only there was a way for it to fold down for storage (or in the car). The must has a lot of options, we just never seem to use them. I am surprised that we havn't need to to replace the batteries with it running throughout the day, every day.My sister also purchased this bouncer and her baby also seems to enjoy it."
2,Not as good as it looks,"I picked this one to be in my baby registry because I loved the way it looks... Well, we received it as a gift but as I was putting it together I noticed a lot of rust on a couple of the ends of the pieces and also, when I was putting it together, I had to back track because I had put something backwards, but to my surprise not one, but 2 of the spring latches broke. Does this sound like a safe item to have your baby in? I do not think so. Maybe Carters should stick to the clothing business. And this is not all. Tried to contact Kids 2, the actual manufacturers and they don't even provide you with a toll free number and so far I have not been able to talk with a live person except a very, very rude operator."
1,4 Stars until it broke after only a month,"THE GOODMy newborn really liked this bouncer. The vibration and swaddling would put him right to sleep. I would take it with us when we went to other people's houses to give him a place to sleep.THE BADThe toy bar didn't interest him at all, but he may be too young yet. The vibration setting stopped working after only a month of use!!!! I will be taking this bouncer back to the store to see if we can get a new one."
2,What a drag...,My husband and I bought this bouncer for $50 and have since given it away free on craigslist. I originally was attracted to it because it felt so soft and looked comfy/nice. Boy was that a mistake! My daughter hates it and would start fussing and crying when I tried to put her in it. The music was okay but the vibrator never even worked. I recommend getting a floor mat instead or a chair with a working vibrator since it is soothing to the babies.
4,Great bouncer for cuddling baby...,"I recieved this bouncer as a gift and love it. It's soft and cuddly and my baby loves to sleep in it (with vibration and music), which is very convenient when I need to be in a room that does not have a bassinet, crib, or playyard. I also received one of the more traditional bouncers (bright colors, music, objects) which I think will be more conducive to play time than the Carter's version. I would suggest that you may consider purchasing both types of bouncers if you purchase the Carter's Bouncer - but, I do definitely recommend the Carter's Bouncer for a comfortable and cuddly place for your baby to rest."
1,Bad toybar and very boring,"My first complaint is the unsafe toybar. It falls off all the time. It kind of looks like a handle. There is a warning on it that it is not a handle, but it's very small. Hard for some grandparents to read. The toybar is not only unsafe it is very boring. My son was not at all interested in the pale colored toys. They are just ""blah"".I put my son in his baby vines bouncer when he was about two weeks old, he looked uncomfortable and cried a little. I took him out and decided to wait and try it again when he was a little older. I tried to put him in it again at about two months and he looked even more uncomfortable now that he was bigger and he cried again. It is a nice looking seat and it is very soft, but it's not very comfy or exciting if you are a baby."
3,Very disappointed,"I fretted over finding the ""perfect"" seat for my son. I recieved this bouncer and another one as a gift from my baby shower and ended up keeping this one. My son is now 4 mos old and the bouncer seat is broken. I also was disappointed that the toys were not very exciting. It is perfect for a newborn, but after about 1 month my baby wanted something more. We use the play gym more now and recently purchased an entertainment center so he could have something to sit up in. We are also looking into buying the Fisher-Price Infant to Toddler Rocker (which is reasonably priced and has excellent reviews!)"
2,Look Elsewhere,"Slap ""for dummies"" on a book and you will get the dummies to buy it. :) This book just wears you out with all the extra chit-chat that really never gets to the point. I have read a few dummies books for programming languages and they are really not all that good because you can buy more comprehensive books that cover everything."
2,Schulze's live albums just don't do it for me,"Why? He's had some great live tracks (""But Beautiful""), but most of the tracks on this (and on the only other live album I have of his, _Dziekuje Poland_ ) don't benefit from the combination of live playing and sequencers. Or maybe it's me."
2,disappointed,"This ring is adjustable, however it still does not fit well at all. It is rather large so to make it fit on most women's toes (unless they're really big) you have to squeeze it down alot. The two ends have to cross to get small enough then it's just too uncomfortable to wear. I'm at least glad it was 1/2 off & it still isn't worth that much. I don't even wear it."
2,Too small,I received these earrings and they were too small for my ears but they are perfect for a child. I would definitely have kept these earrings for one of my girls if they were born in February.
5,ELECTRICAL WIRING COMMERCIAL,tHIS BOOK BASED ON 2005 NATIONAL ELECTRIC CODE IS A GOOD INSTRUMENT FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINERS DEDICATED TO COMMERCIAL DESIGNS
5,Dialectical Behavior Therapy in Private Practice,Practical and useful tools to use in the therapeutic situation.
1,Burn It Yourself Instead!,"Voids Warranty, Burn and melts the Xbox plastic, Causes Rrod by faulty power connection.Just burn your Xbox yourself, you dont need the help of this fan, lol."
5,French book,I received this product within the time frame stated and it was exactly as described. I will definitely do business again!
5,:),"Bob Newhart is the funniest. I read this with my kindle doing the reading while I made out Christmas Cards. It is funny because the deadpan male computer voice would only have been better, had it had Bob's own voice!"
3,I shouldn't even be doing this!: and other things that strike me as...,Excellent overview of bob's brand of humor plus an short biography of hi career as a comedian during his time as a standup and also as ate personality.
4,Who doesn't love Bob Newhart,Just the fact Bob Newhart wrote this was sales pitch enough. He is wonderful. I enjoyed the book every bit as much as I expected I would.
2,He shouldn't have done this...,"Picked this out as I have always enjoyed bob newhart's humor. Unfortunately, it did not transfer over to the written word."
3,Quick read,"I always liked Bob and thought this would be a good read. I did enjoy the background. Not as much laugh out loud as I expected, but a fun read non the less."
3,Okay read,I didn't read the ad carefully when I purchased this product. Even though we thought it was an album of Bob Newhart's comedy routines we enjoyed listening to the book. It was a 3 CD book and we enjoyed alternating this book with the other audiobooks we had purchased.
4,"Interesting take on Germany, during the war.","""Behind the Bedroom Wall"" was a good book - no doubt about that. There are few historical fictions for younger readers dealing with the German children of the war. One word that comes to mind to describe this book is ""redundant."" We know that Korrina thinks Jew's are vile, etc., and there is no need to express that on each page; William's should have explained in greater depth *why* she felt this way, other than that she was brainwashed (there's a reason for everything). Another thing missing was why Korrina changed her mind about Jewish people. A decent book, nonetheless - I recommend."
3,One of the good books I've read,"I would recommend this book to anyone who likes real life fiction. I read this book at different paces, in different spots. I thought the book was very good because of what Korinna decides to do towards the end. The book is about a girl named Korinna. The setting is in her town. She is living in World War Two. She finds out that her mother is hiding Jews behind the wall. Korinna has to make a big decision. She could be a traitor like her mother or turn her mother in. If you would like to know what Korinna does , then you will have to read the book ""Behind the Bedroom Wall"" by Laura E. Williams."
2,a different view...but not the best writing,"I was excited to find this book, as I had never read a book about a ""normal"" german girl during the Holocaust. Korinna is this girl, and she is a devout follower of Hilter...until she finds out her parents are hiding Jews behind her bedroom wall. The fact that Korinna has quite a dilemma on her hands- turn in her own parents? stay silent and therefore a traitor? is interesting, but the writing was bland. I read the entire book in one night, so if you are curious, go for it, but I've read much better books about people on the other side, like the Jews."
5,A great adventure for the Railroad fan,This video is for everyone who likes the Steam Locomotives of the past. Not every one has had the opportunity to witness these gaints running the rails. The senery and the trains in the vdeo are magnificent. It also gives you an oportunity to see these gaints run the rails and learn how they helped make this nation. The DVD format also gives you spectacular colors and options to view. This video is also a excellent referance for the model railroading hobbist and should be anded to their video collection in either fomat(DVD VHS). There are three videos in this series witch are a must for the railroad enthusiast. Even if you aren't into railroading they should be considerd a must see. Enjoy all three videos and experiance the ride of your lifetime.
5,The woman that knows,I feel like kelly is my sister of soul. She make the music connect with her black sisters. To feel that connection with a person you don't even know it is wonderful. If you can make that connection with your fans well you are making money.
2,Disappointing,"While the characters of this story are engaging, there's no follow through. You don't really get an idea of what happens to people at the end. You are left to your own imagination for a lot of instances. I understand that it is Christian fiction since it refers to numerous biblical quotes, but we really don't get an idea of people's faith. The people don't really seem to have a relationship with God. I was truly disappointed."
3,"okay, not great","fun for a few hours but with so many levels that are so similar and a Nintendo prone to crashing you won't be playing this one til the end. sad, because it had some potential."
5,Very entertaining and conveys a great message!,I would recommend this book for primary grade levels and even for older children for the humorous content. This book is as much fun for the teacher as it is for the kids. It has a great message that brothers can also be friends. I recommend this book highly.
5,Some Do Fly!,My boys wanted to read this book over and over again. It's a fun story with a great ending - highly recommended!
4,melanie & harris are great together,Great price for a very good and cute movie. Heard this movie compared to Pretty Woman without the star power but in this case that is fine. Melanie Griffith is alot hotter than Julia roberts anyways.
2,Horrilbe Manufacturer Support,"I purchased the TV in early November, by mid December two of the circuit boards had fried causing blue lines to blend into the picture. Philips sent an authorized repair center to pick up the damaged unit and assess the situation. One of the circuit boards was sent that week but the second repair product is on back order. Neither the customer service or parts department could give me an ETA on when the board would be sent to the ARC. I am still making monthly payments on a television I have been without for several weeks now. And the authorization for a replacement television won't be processed until the standard turnaround time of 20 days has passed. As a long time Philips customer I am disappointed and upset with a total lack of support."
2,"Interesting, but could have been better","I was pretty disappointed with this book. I guess a part of that stemmed from my expectations. I had expected this book to be a narrative of Holy Week and events leading up to and through crucifixion and resurrection, as told from the perspective of Jesus Christ. However, what I found is that the book sort of ""gets into the head"" of Jesus. The book chronicles the thoughts of Jesus throughout this time. I found this to be a style that was difficult to read, and came across as poorly written. This is a difficult topic to tackle and do well, so I give the author credit for trying. I did not find the book to be profound, but rather just poorly written. I aldo fel there were some areas in the book that did not jive with more typical Biblical accounts. I did enjoy the compilation of the four gospels which is found at the end of the book, however. I would say that the book is worth reading if you are interested in reading this history from a different perspective."
4,It's the same thing as the last one!,"This is a good album, but it's the same recording as thier first album pop star. Do they want us to buy the same cd twice or what?"
2,Way too general,"As someone ignorant of marine diesels, I wanted a book that compared the various brands, and told of strong and weak points. I don't want to *design* an engine; I just want to know what I'd be getting into if I found a particular engine in a boat that I was interested in buying. This book isn't a guide as much as it's a theory book. I don't want to know about metal formulation of crankshaft journals, I want to know how difficult it is to replace them.Very disapointing book. Maybe I'll like it better if I ever become facinated with diesels. The author did seem to really know his material, though, maybe too well."
1,not good,it did not work for our doberman.but the order came extrememly fast and what i paid for it seemed fair even though it did not work.
4,Gentle spray,"My vet recommended this for my Shar-pei as she has bad allergies in the fall. It is a gentle spray that she does not mind, and does not smell bad. In fact,I can hardly smell anything. I spray it on any red, irritated areas, and she seems to be okay by the next day."
1,non-working pens,"i purchase the papermate dynagrip ballpoint pens in assorted colors. to my disappointment the pink, red, and green do not write."
5,Everyone should experience these books...,"When in fifth grade, my teacher read to the class 'A Wrinkle In Time'. I was captivated by the story as it unfolded, and quickly found myself scouring the public library for the book to re-read it. Much to my delight I found it to be the first in a series of four books. While the first, 'A Wrinkle In Time', remains my favorite of the four, I loved every single book. Now, as a senior in college, a still adore these books. They are timeless. They teach as well as entertain. They play with the readers imagination, even as they work on the more scientific cut-and-dried areas of the mind. I feel like everyone should experience this story atleast once... you're sure to enver forget it."
5,Excellent verse-by-verse commentary,"This commentary is written by faculty members of the Dallas Theological Seminary. It is written from a dispensational and premillenial eschatological perspective. The authors take a strong literal interpretation of God's Word. There is a careful attempt to interpret the original Hebrew passages to decipher the meaning. The exegesis is sound and the commentators are sincerely committed to determining the correct grammatical structure.There are some applications that Reformed or charismatic theologians would disagree with. The interpretation is according to the tradition of Dallas Theological Seminary. There is always a strong level of uniformity in the conclusions from scholars of this school. Still, this is a solid commentary that articulates the plain meaning of Scripture, even if the interpretations of symbolic and prophetic passages will likely be disputed by some evangelicals."
5,Does Management Work?,"A principal of a company once told me that the primary job of a manager is to get the employee to do what the manager wants him to do. From there to effective management in real life comes a lot of confusion.Robert Austin sorts it all out with a surprisingly simple model, and a strong does of honesty. Managers and workers -- participants in the serious game of work in organizations -- put aside illusions and read this book. And anyone who thought they were helping by designing a measurement program, pay attention too.Measurement and management can work, but only if you know what you're doing."
3,Clarification to earlier review,"Sorry, I should clarify the earlier review (from Anonymous, Melbourne, Australia) - you do find out what happens in the end with his girlfriend etc, but it is very much a summing up, you don't feel or see what happens. And this is hidden at the back of the book after the essays which don't fit into the story."
2,Brian webmaster@datapex.com,"I've used this book to teach my college class and found that it created more confusion than helping. While it does explain the tools and how to use them, it never really takes you through building a site from the ground up. For beginners this book was not a good plan. The lessons confused my students a bit. Some of them didn't grasp the idea of using tables as opposed to floating boxes. Some of the steps described in the book also didn't work well when implemented outside of the lessons. I admit that GoLive has many powerful features and can be a great tool for creating and maintaing a website, but as for Classroom in a book, well, I'll be teaching from something else next semester."
3,Beware the Millennium Snake,"The sequel to the earlier 'System Shock', this story features the fourth Doctor, travelling alone after 'The Deadly Assassin', arriving back on Earth in December 1999. The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the world is concerned about what the Millennium Bug will bring (ah yes, the good old days!).One company, Condef, promises to provide solutions to every Y2K problem, no matter how unprepared you are. But someone is gathering together old I2 equipment...The Doctor is duly aided once more by Commander Harry Sullivan of MI5, formerly a travelling companion. And, while she is largely absent from these pages, Sarah Jane Smith is still a significant player in this book. (Interestingly, apparently Justin Richards had planned for Harry and Sarah to be married...).The book's main problem is that it suffers from sequelitus - if you've read 'System Shock"", you know a lot of what happens in 'Millennium Shock' even before you pick it up. Still, it isn't a bad read."
4,Excelente pero con algunos detalles.,Quitarle la chaqueta y la falda es un poco dificil y ademas se puede manchar o ensuciar mientras se le quitan estas prendas. La figura me parece que es muy diferente a la del anime o manga la expresion de la cara es un poco infantil a diferencia de la Ryofu real y su sensual actitud. El cabello esta bien pero el color es tambien muy diferente a el personaje original. Estos detalles son un poco desalentadores pero aun asi es una excelente figuras y el cuerpo es uno de los mas bonitos y bien proporcionados de mi coleccion.
2,Longevity?,"I have always enjoyed the scent that accompanies the Bay Rum aftershave. This product, while being easy on the face, has a scent that lasts for only a short period of time. For me this is not acceptable so I purchased ""Genuine Ogallala Bay Rum,"" which is a more expensive but has far more ""staying power."""
3,Good but not great. Needs an Editor.,"Ooof. It's not a five star book by any means. It's a decent three star book. It needs some serious editing and makes me believe it's just a cover the publishers rushed out to profit on the Potter series (or lack of since it ended). It's a good idea, good writing... but it needed to be a hundred pages less and should have been edited. It's explains the same things over and over and features some pretty flimsy characters that have about as much depth as a character in a commercial. It's a good book with some good ideas but it's not perfect by any means and there are much better books available that are better worth your time. Just my opinion so don't get into some internet creepy flame war. It's not that good... and it's definately not a classic. How can people give it five stars? It's no Huck Finn."
2,This game is so cheesy!,"You play as a sportscar on your way in eight races against cars that all look the same. The play control is really bad as you can only go forward, nor can you even turn around, just move left and right. This was the first racing game for Nintendo, so what do you expect? There is still big challenge as you cross checkpoints to get more time, which makes the game so challenging, because there is so little time and the races are so tediously long. Another big thrill about the game was it is the first and only game that features 3D! The game came with 3D glasses and a 3D mode. Even though it never looked at all 3D, which is why this never caught on and no more 3D games were made."
1,Get some ear plugs!,"I must have been distracted and missed the reviews on this. I would never have bought it if I had read them.But I did buy it, I just received it and plugged it in. It is SO LOUD THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A HAIR DRYER RUNNING IN THE ROOM. How can this little thing be so loud?Well, from the reviews I guess this wont be a problem for long as it shouldnt last."
1,Do not buy from this company,"Do not buy from this company. I bought this product and my order apparently got duplicated. I called the cs# when I found this out (I received two separate shipments) and told the woman about it. She said that she would send a return label, which took forever to receive. I also got an email saying that the order had been duplicated. I sent the duplicate back and then received a REPLACEMENT in the mail, never got a refund for the duplicate charge. I sent an email to the cs because I was not willing to spend my own money to talk to another person who could not speak English well when they were the ones that screwed up in the first place. I have never heard back from this company and am reporting them to the BBB. Horrible customer service and the product doesn't work very well anyway!!!!!!!!"
3,good for learning steps,"This video is great for learning basic latin dance steps and vocabulary, but as far as ""cardio"" it doesn't really do much to get your heartrate up. I could burn more calories on the the treadmill. If your goal is to learn latin dance steps, this is a easy video to learn from. As far as a workout, it's a bit slow for me."
1,lifeless,"I love Dancing With The Stars, especially Maks. But he and Cheryl are extremely lifeless as exercising leaders. They only say the bare minimum. I will not enjoy this, it will be drudery.....was hoping for maybe a little fun."
2,"Ok, but not great","Definitely, the actually dancing does give you a bit of a workout, but another reviewer was right, Cheryl does have a monotone voice and about put me to sleep, and what's up with the dark-haired female dancer in there? She looked VERY uninterested in the whole thing. Cheryl seemed to stumble quite a bit in her talking, and I thought Max was better, probably due to being in the other video. I will do this video a bit, but am kind of disappointed, again with the kind of ""boringness"" to it."
2,Not the fun I expected,"I bought this DVD at a used bookstore. I am taking it BACK. This workout was very boring. I was looking for a Zuma like DVD, this is not it!"
2,Awful!,I bought this because of the price and thought it would help remove pounds and inches in the waist and leg area. I thought it was kind of boring. Also I found that for beginners like me they go to fast over some of the steps and you cannot catch them. Also in doing so they do some of the steps so fast if you don't understand how they explain to do them or catch it when they do it slow once or twice your out of luck. I think the only think I like about this cd is the warm up and the tone up at the end.
3,excerisel,"The video was shipped in a timely matter. It was also in very good shape, but it wasn't what I had in mind,for a exercise type video."
1,BORING,"So boring! Not really a good workout at all. You really can't get much more basic, and there is no enthusiasm at all!"
3,Easy to follow,This one is easy to follow but I would have liked it to be a little more intense. The instructions are much better than they are in some of the other videos though!
3,If your looking for cardio-choose another DVD...,"I am a huge ZUMBA fan and had to drop my membership at the Y. I was looking for something w/hardcore cardio. The ""dance"" part of the dvd is way more instructional than movement all at one time. I like my HR to be about 145..highest I got was 122..in the ""toning"" section. All in all, it's just okay. Still looking for the ""one"" that makes me feel energized!!!"
2,Disappointed!,"I thought this video would only expand what I have already learned and be a great workout. Once you get into the harder steps, it is too hard to follow. The dancers are facing you. If they had someone dancing with their back to you on screen, you could follow the same steps with your feet. It would be a great workout out if you can do it the way it is presented. Not me."
2,Won't use it again.,Joyless and boring. I'm not a workout fanatic; I need something fun and motivational. I threw this one in my closet.
1,NOT WORTH THE $$,This DVD was very poorly lead. They gave you little to no warning before changing moves. it was almost as if they made it up as they went. verrrrry boring. the instructors didn't even smile ever. it looked like they wanted to be doing anything but making a workout dvd. i bought mine at target and i'm going to see if they'll let me take it back
5,Wowzers!!,"I LOVED this video. I haven't tried the first one, but after using this one, I'm definitely going to buy it as well. I danced and taught ballet for nearly 15 years, and I haven't done any of that for awhile after I had children. I got really tired of workout video after workout video that was just ""exercising."" This video is the first I've come across that is actually dancing! If you do this workout with the proper technique, your legs and core will be burning in the first five minutes. I had so much fun and was smiling the entire time. It was easy to fall back into steps that I'd learned so long ago as a dancer, and it made me feel young again. Love, love, loved it."
3,"80's kiss unmasked, just a sneak peak, Why not fill the disc full?","This is the second installment of 3 in the Kiss: mellenium collection. This section covers the 80's Kiss. Great songs included, but its just a taste at the often overlooked kiss years. Yes, kiss was definitley scarier without the makeup, but the music was still good. I just wish this disc had more on it. Oh well, a good starter disc. If you buy this one, you might as well buy the other two for the whole mediocher collection. So much kiss to fit into 3 discs, although all 3 are short and could have included more."
2,Their 80's music WAS BAD! SO IS THE BEST OF! ....surprising,"i am a huge huge huge kiss fan but i still know that their 80s music was complete (...) with a few exceptions. There was altogether 3 songs on this cd that were actually worth listening to. you don't need this album, nor do you need any of the KISS 80 CDs2 best songs: All Hell's Breakin Loose & Hide Your Heart2 worst songs: tears are falling & lick it up"
1,ANOTHER UNIVERSAL COMPILATION!!!,"Yes, Universal has done it again. This makes the 6th ""Best Of"" compilation in 8 years, and it's getting quite pathetic. If you do not own any compilations I would recomend ""Kiss Gold 1974-1982"" which will be released in August of this year. Better choices would be ""Double Platinum"", ""Killers"", or ""Smashes, Thrashes & Hits"" because they have something different on them instead of the same old songs re- released for the umpteenth time!!"
1,a worthy but pedestrian effort,"In part this book is touching, to the extent that it expresses a husband (Lewis)'s love of his dead wife (Susan Sheets Pyenson). But it is a book which could have been written a hundred years ago. It is too dry and dull for a popular book, but then doesnt really have much which would catch the attention of historians of science. One isn't sure what they (I suppose mostly he) were trying to do."
1,Misleading description,"This is NOT the original soundtrack from the television series. If you are looking for this, the correct disc is:Victory At Sea: Music From The Award Winning Television Series (1952 TV Series) [SOUNDTRACK]Richard RodgersAudio CD (August 15, 2000)Original Release Date: August 15, 2000Number of Discs: 1Publisher: Q. RecordsASIN: B00004TSC1"
5,You can actually feel the ships roll on the high seas,"I can remember my folks (air force lt. col. & army nurse) playing this as I was growing up, and I can't recall any other album or recording of any other music that puts me there, in the pacific, on the high seas, rolling with the waves and seeing the big guns fired, the way this album does. As long as I live, this will remind me of the BIG ONE, and also of my mom & dad. There are such glorious movements that can and will move one to tears if they have any recollection of the war at all. A must for any collection."
1,A sampler of patriotic music,"This is NOT the soundtrack of the TV series 'Victory At Sea'. Instead it has a medley of some of the tunes from that series, plus other patriotic and marching music. Althought the performances are OK, this is not what I was looking for. What in the world is the Warsaw Concerto doing in this collection..."
3,Worth the time to read,"While I haven't read ""Shadows Over Lyra"", I have read the books that constitute the collection. While not ""high"" fantasy on the order of Tolkien, Rawn, or Martin, the books are well written entertainment and a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon. Written in a different style from Wrede's ""Enchanted Forest"" series, the stories are free of the pretentious nonsense that a lot of current fantasy wallows in."
5,I Love This Book!,This is the best book of this genre I've read in ages! The story and characters make me want to be there!ENJOY!
3,disappointed,"I really like the work outs on the first of the 2 dvds in this set. Unfortunately, the second disc will not play. I received a shoddy product, but since the 1st disc is just what I was looking for, I just kept it instead of having the hassle of returning both discs."
2,A distraction for Copper Scroll enthusists,"The copper scroll, is a burial list of gold, silver and other assets found 2km from Qumran near the Dead Sea. This book by Feather, it well researched about the facts of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Copper Scroll. But his logic and conclusions don't follow archaeological evidence or the context of the events in 66 AD. They are way off in left field and try to tie into Egyptology. An amusing distraction, but if you want to learn about the copper scrolls, you can strike this book off your reading list.Far better would beCopper Scroll Studies (Academic Paperback)orSecrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls"
4,Great Book!,"My average practice test score in this book was 88%, I took each of the five practice tests only once. My actual test score was 85%. I would say this book will give you an accurate indication of how you are progressing. The practice tests really helped me build confidence to take the test. Highly Reccomend!"
