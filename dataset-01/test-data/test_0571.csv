5,So Many Choices!,"You have complete control over this game and once you learn the tricks, which are easy with the tutorial, you'll have hours of fun. The characters are fun and the soundtrack keeps you going. The announcer is also fun. This game is also a great multiplayer game. Now you have a reason to get that large screen t.v.!"
5,WAY COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am so glad that they came out with a series of books on this epic tale of space explores with their REALLY handsome pilot. I hope that there are a lot more to come:) A 16 yr. old reader
2,"Could be a good, but cluttered with nonsense","This could have been a good book, and is in spots, on a subject that can be challenging. But in their effort to make the book readable it's been cluttered with inane, nonsensical examples and over-friendly text. The writing style is written conversationally, not textually, including the annoying asides. I've worked with MVS (and) JCL for over 20 years and found this book very difficult to read and to follow, not only as a linear text but as a reference. I strongly recommend Murach's JCL for OS/390 and z/OS instead."
1,Not what I expected,"I just used up a bottle of this perfume that came from a department store. Looking for a bargain, I purchased your product online within a couple of weeks. Both were the Eau De Toilette Spray. I have opened and used the perfume. I believe it is a ""copycat"" fragrance or watered down version. At first, it smelled like the same perfume I knew, just not as intense. After even an hour of wearing it, though, none of the smell remained. Not even a hint, if I rubbed my wrist were it was sprayed. My previous bottle could be smelled hours later. After closer inspection, I noticed the box and bottle do not not say ""Christian"" Dior, just Dior. A portion of the clear sticker on the bottom of the bottle has been carefully cut off. I am disappointed with this purchase and will pay the $20 more store price next time. I only gave it a one star rating, because the system would not let me give it none."
5,emotional masterpiece,"Heavens To Betsy is Corin Tucker(guitar/vocals)of Sleater-Kinney and Tracy Sawyer(drums/bass). This album is a brutally honest examination of relationships, anger , love and even racism. Corin possesses a powerfull voice that can convey anger,heartbreak,& desire with total conviction. 'Stay Away' and 'Terrorist' are strong warnings but the highlight of the album is 'Complicated'- a beautifull song that is so honest and powerfull that it should close the album. 'White Girl' is basically a introspective song about racism and white priviledge, a theme that comes up in another song as well (liner notes explain the songs' purpose and guide listeners to books on racism and sexism). This album comes across as so very personal yet most listeners (into this genre) will find a part of themselves in some songs, and it may hurt.Overall this release should empower girls."
1,"Horrible. Plugged unit in, created two electrical sparks",Do not buy this item. I waited a week for the item to be sent by the seller and it sparked and stopped working as soon as I plugged it in to the computer.
2,"Terrible, but better than 1 and 2",This game isn't that great. I didn't like the characters. The worlds in this one is retarded and it was an easy game. But it's still better than parts 1 and 2.
1,"lining tore complete after only two washings, no lining inside the sleeves of jacket.","the lining tore completely after only two washings. it also has no lining in the sleeves and is very light, definitely not for winter. now i have to sew the lining back myself."
5,Light weight coat wind breaker.,This is a light weight rain resistant coat and wind breaker it has fleece lining in the body of the coat but no fleece lining in the sleeves of the coat I use it for seattle weather and it is just fine for that I would recommend this coat to any one needing just a light weight coat the zipper works great and it has deep pockets and the price is right.
1,Not what was pictured,We ordered this item and what we received was not what was pictured. We were looking specifically for a pole system with the easy-adjust arm as pictured. This is not what was received. Be careful - what you see is NOT what you get! It's going back immediately.
2,A whiny Ride Across America,"Any book that gives you information about what really happens during a long tour is useful. This book would have been much more useful if Ms. Siegret found something to enjoy and less to whine about. I'm sure this is a question of writing style, no one could have done all those rides if they were that awful."
2,too small,"this necklace looked nice on the internet so i purchased it. when i received it in the mail i was really disappointed, the chain is too thin and the pendant is too small ( for my taste) so i had to return it"
1,THE WORST TENT MADE DO NOT BUY!!!!!,I have hade many tents over the years and have never been more dissapointed in a camping item than this tent! It came with the worst instructions you could have although I got the tent up in about 30 min.it is very wobbly and a poorly constructed pile of !!##**! It had no illustrations or anything to tell you which pole went where. Only a poorly written direction sheet. The set up has to be figured out blindly!!! I got lucky though I thought and found the item on Amazon for $107.00 including shipping in June of 2007. It was the worst thing I could have bought even at $5.00 DO NOT BUY THIS! It cannot be returned and at the price you will pay now $175-$225 plus shipping you will be bummed out. Even though I payed less then what it is going for now which is 2 weeks later I could not reccomend this or any other Texsport product to anyone for any price! If you want to get the most for your $ buy Coleman at least with them you can get your mony back if you buy ##**!#!!
5,Amazing Information,"Practical, informative, imaginative, and economical, this book is what every urban magicker needs to read."
3,First effort,"First book in a series by this author. A bit disjointed in character devilment and questions left unanswered in back story, but entertaining enough to let me try his series again in future"
1,on the rocks,"the story line is what to expect from early rock films - weak, but contains performances of a number or rock stars and of course includes a look at Alan Freed a real co-inventor and promoter of rock and roll.This film is of very poor quality transfer and I would search for another company for a decent remaster."
1,Terrible DVD Image Transfer,"This D V D's Image transfer from the original film is extremely poor quality. So much so, that is should not be sold by Amazon.com. I returned the d v d."
2,good heat,they work good for two days not design for construction worker not heavy duty dont work well when you on them on day moving
1,Save Your Money!,"My ill 80 year old mother asked me to order these for her. I read the reviews and recommended another product. She said she had used these before successfully, and told me to order them anyway. MISTAKE!! One set of insoles arrived defective, the other set works part of the time. We haven't yet figured out what causes the insoles to work or not work. Amazon's ineffective return policy doesn't allow me to return this product, and I have now ordered another product that hopefully will work. Unfortunately there is no lower rating than one star. Don't throw your money away buying these insoles."
4,Better than nothing,"I picked these up to try in my snowboard boots since my toes freeze while boarding. I had read the reviews, so I was already prepared not to expect much heat from these. I will have to say that my feet stayed at a more comfortable temperature than ever before while on the mountain (when the temps are below 20 degrees F). I would prefer just a bit more heat, but they definitely helped! I did have to work to keep the cord tucked away where it was comfortable."
2,Look like a clown,These warmers may work well but I cant find out because I have too much trouble at 5am trying to get them on. The cords are linked to a roller system that makes me want to throw them out in the yard. You can never get them even and attached at the same time. May work well but not recommended.
5,You have to get this.,"I was at Dane's show and I suggest everyone should get this DVD. The 90 minute HBO special was hilarious, but you HAVE to watch the extended concert (the one I was at) because most of the funniest jokes of the night weren't even put in the 90 minute show. For example, the pumpkin bomb skit. So if you are a serious Dane fan, you have to get this, it's worth it."
4,pretty good,This one is a little vulgur but still funny. I think this was after his parents passed away and he was in a dark place. but i still enjoyed it.
3,Not Bad,The show was pretty funny and he talks about some crazy things. It is not a bad movie but you have to have a certain type of humor to appreciate Dane Cook.
5,Easily one of the funniest stand up DVD's I have ever seen.,"Dane fan or just a fan of stand up, definitely pick this up..Dane Cook is hilarious and this special proves it."
3,Pretty good....but....,"A lot of older material presented....I'm a huge fan, but I was hoping for more new material, and this one just wasn't as funny as some of his other stuff. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of funny parts, but I did not think it was worth the twenty bucks for the DVD."
5,Dane Cook - Vicious Circle,Dane is one funny guy! This dvd had me rolling on the floor holding my stomach because it hurt from laughing so much. Lookout for the 'Sneeze' sketch. Best thing i have EVER heard!And girls...it definitely doubles as some eye candy!!Dane for President!
2,greatly disappointed,"I saw the commericials on the television and I thought that this game looked like my kinda game. I prefer video games that are adventurous without bloody killings and with lots of tasks to accomplish where rewards are waiting for me. However, when I finished the game in 4 days, I couldn't believe my adventure was over. This is by far the shortest PS2 game I have ever played. I think that the game could have been much longer and included more exciting adventures and tasks. The graphics are great and the no loading is great too. But, I think the creators could have created more for Jack & Dexter to accomplish before the game came to an end. It was too easy. This game may be great for younger children, but for adults that are looking for fun challenges, I do not recommend this game."
1,dosent hold a candle to any rachet and clank game.,warning this game looks childish and it is. its boring youre running around collecting power cells a carbon copy of most platformers is exactly what this is. personally i think jand d is very boring. youre constantly being annoyed by daxter and collecting little easter eggs looks like a kids game and plays like one too. if youre a the parent of an 8or9 year old this is a best buy. if you are a serious gamer get rachet and clank going commando it blows this game away. no comparison jak and daxter shall be done with rachet and clank and insomniac deserve all the spotlight.
2,not too fun,"this game is borring its only for little kids i have all 3 jak games 2,and3 are good but this game is for little kids whoever likes this game is stupid buthole"
4,t adventure game,Unlike many adventure games this one doesn't make you watch the whole thing. It does have its share of cutscences but most of the time you get to run around in a free environment. They keep the edge of the game world away from you nice to. It has a good story and its quite long and keeps you interested by always introducing new charaters and the levels are huge.Only problems I see is the life scale is made up weird must collect 50 green things to get another peice of life. But its not much concern as since the late 90's all adventure games you have unlimited deaths. There are some anoying 3d jumping as always but the L3 analong control is nicely used to move the camera whereever you want around yourself.All and all its a fun game if you like doofy adventure games has some funny stuff and some anoying stuff.
5,best game ever,"this was a awesome game,if you like good games that make you go wow that was amazing then this is the game for you it is difficult but easy like playing a Mario or sonic game.if you don't believe me,check out a lets play on youtube you wont be disappointed."
5,The best game ever,"I think Jak and Daxter is a very fun game. For me it was a little short because I played it all day. It is almost perfect, everything but the fact that they don't tell you how to get all the power cells. All in all it is a GREAT game and you should buy it."
2,awful game,this game is terrible in all aspects accept graphics. the characthers are irritating the music is boring and the gameplay is pure trash. all you do is walk around collecting and that is it period. another thing is how bad can video game music be. all jak and daxter has is the same damm beat every 2 seconds. the characthers kept pi-------g me off. there just is not enough to do in the game tomake it a winner. the controls completely suck too giving you a hard time all the time. overall the only good thing was the graphics theyre nice and pleasent to look at. but who cares if the actuaul gameplay is no fun.
5,Jak and Daxter,My children and I enjoyed spending time playing this game. It is a great game to prepare them for the Need for Speed games. The game came to me in new condition and I would reccoment others to try the game and check grannysdream for other great deals.
4,Pretty good...,"Ok, I thought this game was pretty good. But hey, I was only eight when I got it. I've seen alot of people saying it stinks. Most of these people are allowed to Ratchet and Clank. I've never played it. I'll put it in specific terms: if you aren't allowed to play alot of T games, this game rocks.Pros: Awesome graphicsCons: Too short"
5,Greatest highchair! Doesn't need to recline!,"This highchair is the greatest. I have been using it for my son since he was 5 months. Some of the reviewers complained about this high chair not reclining, however, there is really normally no need for one to recline. As a nurse, I am educated about the fact that a baby who can't be propped up straight is not ready to eat solid foods safely. The only time a baby should be reclined in a high chair is if they are napping there. Are you able to swallow safely while reclining?? Anyway, this high chair blends so nicely with our decor and has a nice, hygenic, easy to clean tray. The storage underneath is also a great place for all of those bibs. I just love it!"
3,"Beautiful chair, but not so user friendly.","I love the Eddie Bauer high chair because of its looks. It's very sturdy and looks better than most high chairs out there.Pros:* Attractive* Sturdy* Slide open trays to keep baby's food out of reachCons:* Very heavy and difficult to move around* The restraint system is odd - I hate it* Difficult to attach the trayIn retrospect, I would have purchased a chair with wheels so it can be moved easily. Baby loves to be in the kitchen when I'm cooking and to move the Eddie Bauer high chair is so cumbersome and difficult. I've bruised my legs several times in doing so. It's sooo heavy. I'm all about a high chair being used to eat and not to lounge or play in. I don't need a chair with a reclining back or toys that are attached...but I do need ease of use. It is a beautiful chair though!"
4,Beautiful chair,"The Eddie Bauer ""B"" is for Bear chair is a gorgeous piece of furniture. My husband and I wanted something that would look nice in the kitchen as well as be useful. This high chair is sturdy since it's made out of wood and has the dishwasher safe trays. We also like how the tray can be pulled off one-handed, a very nice feature when dealing with a squirmy infant/toddler. The only thing we don't like about it is the strap that goes around my sons waist. It is a poor design for a high chair that costs $109.00. At any rate, we are otherwise happy with our purchase and would recommend this to our friends."
5,There's nothing like the original.,"It's getting harder and harder to find original controllers in good condition, but there is nothing like the true original Nintendo equipment."
1,A book containing misleading information about the true facts,"I got the book expecting to find insightful and unbiased investigation through the point of view of ODHA. Nevertheless, the author views are totally biased in favor of the ODHA lawyers and the Public Ministry. This feature of the book helped me to confirm that the arguments used by them to sentence the two military officers, and the catholic father to 20 years in jail are based on untrustful witnesses and false declarations, which are still supported by the author. The only good thing about this book is that it motivated me to read once again the book ""Quien mató al obispo?"" written by Maite Rico and Bertrand de Lagrange, which I think that contains much more trustful data, and that I wish it gets translated into English to broader its difussion. I hope that the inocent military people who are now in jail, as a result of an undeserved and unfair sentence could, sometime soon, be free."
2,Heavily biased,"It's a good story, and I assume that it is mostly true. But there are two sides to every story. The author fails to examine the other side. Instead, he has appointed himself as the public relations arm of ODHAG. Instead he resorts to euphemisms such as renaming revolutionaries as ""students.""Two things could have improved this book. First, he could have made an attempt to explore ""the other side."" He made no such attempt. I would have appreciated more ""this is what they say and this is why they're wrong."" Instead the author only makes a facade of exploring the other side of the story, and only does so in order to vilify them. Second, the book goes on and on and on. The author is anything but concise and spends a lot of time rambling about unrelated topics."
2,definitely not a page turner,"i ordered this book because of the reviews and the reviews are much better than the book. this may be an interesting story, but the writing is poor. the story meanders from one character to another in an aimless fashion. i am now three-quarters of the way thru the book and hope to ""find out who done it,"" but don't much care at this point."
5,Singapore sketchbook,A very beautifully done tour of the restoration of colonial Singapore rendered in watercolors and charcoal sketches. The book gives glimpses into the everyday street life of Singapore in the 1980's. A provocative Journal which makes the reader long for a spur of the moment trip to the orient.
1,vis-à-vis Scripture,"...Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.[Romans 12:3]For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.[2 Timothy 4:3]But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves...[2 Timothy 3:1-2]He must increase, but I must decrease.[John 3:30]"
4,A really good book,"I really liked this book. I was surprised that the story seemed to move as well as it did, considering it's one of the shorter Sunfire books. (Did anyone else notice how the books got skinnier as the series went on?) The story was, for as much as a romance book can be, believable. Margaret is a great character and there was a nice twist with the usual two guys and a girl theme."
1,Oh Please just Stop,"One good idea (not unique) that is stated well enough in the free sample of the book. The rest is just so dated, very obsessive, and cult loving. Unless you believe Freud's view of life is the gospel and the word ""man"" means just men (hard to imagine a women reading this book since the entire female gender seems to be left out) then skip the book and just read the free sample."
1,"Rating for the physical book, not the subject matter.","This book is incredibly cheaply assembled. It looks like they cut out a paperback version, glued it into a hardback, then stuck a $32 price on it and called it a hardback book. In fact, when you open the book, the publisher label is Free Press PAPERBACKS!!!! The price for the book quality is a rip-off. The paper is cheap. The cover is a cheap, unclear xerox that is stuck on the cover. Do NOT spend the money on buying a new copy."
1,Denial of Death Illustrates the Irrationality of Psychoanalysis,Call up your local college and talk to some experimental psychologists. Ask them if psychotherapy as any value and they will name several valid forms of treatment. Then ask about psychoanalysis and they will laugh. Psychoanalysis is nothing more them a pompous fraud more akin to faith healing then science. Only the irrational agree with it. Psychoanalytic theory has it self been analyzed and it isn't even internally consistent.Most psychoanalytic premises are a combination of the asinine and the absurd. In this case the author argues that only a coward who's afraid of death would attempt to heroically risk or sacrifice his life. That's right the quickest way to find a bunch of cowards is to get a list of Congressional Metal of Honor winners. What else can you expect when the core premise of psychoanalytic theory is the idea that little girls want to be molested by their fathers? Can you say Electra Complex?
2,Not For Everybody,"For us lesser mortals, like myself, Denial of Death was a disappointing read-----unless one had a degree in psychology or psychiatry,or preferably, both."
3,"My Experiece of ""The Denial of Death""","Although slanted toward the general reader, ""The Denial of Death""is heavily weighted with neoFreudian concepts. A reader requires more than a passing familiarity with Freud and the development of the psychanalytic movement to make sense of significant sections of the book. At the same time, there are sections that no one should miss reading. These sections alone earn five stars. Coupled with the more technical and peculiar concepts of contemporary psychoanalhysis, however, my experience of the work averages at three stars."
5,Stunning,"A very interesting view on how the world of psychoanalysis changed our views on life and death. Becker has done a wonderful job of painting a portrait of the human condition, and has engaged the subject in a deep, meaningful manner."
4,nice sturdy piece,I was very happy when I got my hands on this wrench; it is nice and heavy and solid and does not feel cheap or flimsy at all.
1,Bad,These are a great price. But that is the only good thing. The quality is bad! The adapter has a poor fit on both the male end and the female end. I had to really force the 3.5mm cable and even then the connection was poor. I would NOT recommend these to anyone. I would pay more and get a higher quality. I am scared to even use this one as a back-up!
2,Loose,"Like all of these that I have owned over many years, it is loose. The miniplug almost falls right out. How is it that even cheap MP3 players and radios and cell phones are fine but these things, that have no other purpose, universally suck?"
4,Passion Marks...or Scars,"This book was an enjoyable read even though I didn't think the title matched the book. (My opinion, of course!)Anyway, I enjoyed reading the book, even though the homosexual sex scenes was a bit graphic. The emotions ranged from tears to laughter, which was good, but overall Kevin realized that he can be happy outside the glass house. I was proud of Kevin for his courage to leave behind the drama and to move forward with his life.I, too, agree with a reviewer that stated that the ending could've been somewhat better."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"I never received the book and after emailing the seller twice, I never got a response back from them. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,OK book,So-so book. I found this wasn't my type of devotional book. Kind of disappointing. Imitation of Christ is way better.
4,ProStretch,I ordered the ProStretch to help me stretch my feet. I have Plantar Fascia and it works well to do that. I place it by my wall and stretch as often as I can.
4,very useful,This is very seful in my line of work in home health. Easy to carry and the patient can really feel the stretch. i get better result than manual stretch or using belt. Highly recommended. The only drawback is the price. I thik the price is a little tad too much...
4,Very good fit,This kit is a near perfect fit for the Cadillac CTS. It does not stick out any further than the original radio that it replaced. The only minor problem I have with it is that it does not perfectly match the color of the rest of the dash but it is a very minor difference.
1,Made of hard cheese,"This thing absolutely fell apart. The vertical bits wouldn't stay vertical because the clamps that are supposed to hold them together deform and fall off. I swear this is made out of aged cheddar spray painted silver. It lasted about one month in our apartment and then it was in the dumpster. I know it's super tempting to buy because it's so much cheaper than the other bike racks, but it will be a waste of your money. Buy something made with love and pride instead of this cheap stuff."
2,"Amen, and beware the keyboard!","I agree with all of the negative comments made by previous reviewers, particularly the difficulty of opening the cover. I would add that the keyboard is very difficult to use. When a key is pressed, it gets stuck on one side or the other under the faceplate. If you push it again to unstick it, you generate the same character again.I recommend that anyone interested in this product handle one in a store before purchase."
2,Mixed,"I am very happy with the dictionary and Thesaurus. However, the lid is poorly manufacutered and difficult to open, making me wonder if the reduced price of the item was because of the cover difficulty."
5,I love to write. Don't trust my spelling. MWD-460 will help,"Delv was fast !! I have an older Franklin Dictionary it's great,, now I need one for my second office . The MWD-460 filled the void .. and it's much smaller ."
1,Horrible spell checker,"I bought this MWD-460 and is the poorest quailty I have ever seen.Opening the case is the first major challenge. Then trying to set the time and date is a nightmare, I was never able to do it. The screen is lousy and poorly lighted. To use this as a spell checker you need to know how to spell pretty good to start with or you can forget about finding the correct word. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
1,An Improvement That Is Not An Improvement,"I had used the Franklin MWD440 since the 1990s. It was simple and direct. This ""improved"" version is awful. It is difficult to open. You can't go directly to input a word (it's ""home"" page is a clock). The input is all caps. It is really a waste of money. My 440 died after MUCH happy use. Now I'll just do without and use a hardcopy dictionary until I find a better electonic version ... like an EXACT REPLICA of the Franklin MWD440!THREE CHEERS to Amazon.com for a decent return policy!"
1,Does not work as a spell corrector,"I bought this for my daughter to help with spelling. It was useless for that purpose. For example, typing in the word ""becus"" came up with ""basis"" and ""bassos"" but not ""because."""
4,Unique and haunting,"A long time ago ...touted this as the ultimate midnight movie, which gives you some idea of what a dreamy trip it is. The ending haunts me to this day, although you will have to be very patient to get to it. An exquisite treat for the avid film buff.(Trivia note: one of the men in the house is film director Barbet Schroeder)"
3,Works great for the money,"I purchased these because crutchfield lists these as oversized, and fitting GM mount 6.75 Openings. They are slightly larger than the standard 6.5, but not quite big enough to be 6.75.-They did not fit the stock 6.75 openings, they were too small, and with the mounts attached they were too big to fit the 6.75 openings darn!!!-I had to drill new holes in my door to make these fit :(-Sound is acceptable, bass is SO-SO, I only purchased these becasue they were supposed to fit, I think you can get a better value elsewhere for the money. They are not bad consiering they are Jensen/Audiovox products, just not great."
5,Analyzing White America,Paul Mooney has the ability to be hysterically funny while proving a point. I could watch this DVD over and over again. Love it!
4,on point,Props to Tim Reid&Paul Mooney on bringing this film to Life. Paul Mooney will crack on you&Blow your sides out. Bro Man had me rolling&also had me nodding in agreement with alot of the things he said. he just puts it out there for you to think. He ain't afraid of being himself. the Man understands timing&puts it out there for you to digest.Paul Mooney is One of the Most Creative Minds who has ever picked up a Mic&also as a Writer.
2,Just OK,"Although this was a funny DVD, I have seen much funnier stuff from Mooney. This is my favorite, but it still worth watching."
1,piece of junk,"I seldom write reviews, but my experience with these scissors is so shockingly bad that I just couldn't help myself. Please do not waste your money on this item.I bought these scissors no more than a month ago. Today I was using them and they literally FELL APART IN MY HANDS. I was astonished. There is a metal screw at the joint, which gives the appearance that it's heavy duty, but it screws into the plastic handle, not the metal part of the scissors. The plastic around the screw just broke away. I had used these scissors fewer than a dozen times when this occurred.I have already thrown away the packaging, so I guess I cannot get my money back or a replacement. The other pair has not broken yet but I'm sure it's only a matter of time.When I taught young children, I only bought Fiskars scissors. I suppose I should not have strayed from that brand. I will be replacing these scissors with Fiskars scissors."
4,Very sharp for light cutting,"This is among the sharpest scissors I've ever used. It is great for precision cutting. But when I cut through a thicker plastic product package, the handle was not so comfortable with all the pressure. I recommend this for light duty paper jobs."
4,"smooth action, could be sharper","These scissors have a lovely positive action and extremely comfortably grips. The edges seem a bit rough and they were not great for collage on paper-Matisse would probably disapprove. A bit of hand-sharpening improved things, but it doesn't seem like you should have to sharpen brand new scissors."
2,"Great for 1 day, but they shrink","I bought a pair of these after an ankle surgery because they were the only thing that didn't hurt the top of my foot. They were great for 1 day, then I left them in the car on a 90 degree day, and they shrunk considerably. I'll return them, and be more careful next time. Crocs does say to avoid extreme heat, but does not define ""extreme heat"". I assumed that meant ""don't get them near a fire"" for obvious reasons, not ""don't leave them in the sun"".Update: I did return these crocs with absolutely no hassle, and bought a pair of the Endeavors. I have arthritis in my knees and ankle from sports injuries and a motorcycle accident, and these shoes have been great. Check out my review of the Endeavors here on Amazon for more info."
1,Terrible Treats!,"Accidentally purchased these for dogs thinking they were the dream bones I normally buy. What a waste of money, my dogs love the other brand but theses are the same price and my pets absolutely hate them. Before I noticed I purchased the wrong brand I noticed they were really dry when I took the out of the package."
4,my dog like it so much,it is really good. my dog can finish it in 20 mins. give me 20 mins break. i will buy again.
4,Be aware that this is third edition rules.,"If you are playing 4th edition rules, you will need to convert the characters and equipment."
1,barbie tv,I got the TV for my grandchildren for Christmas and My daughter Just told me that the sound don't work. The Tv is supposed to be new don't know what happen but this is not what I expected
2,Great Squirrel Feeder!,"We bought this feeder because it was advertised as being squirrel-proof. Lucky for our squirrels, that's not even close to the truth. They've plumped up nicely and do a great job of scaring away all the birds. Today, one of the squirrels actually stole one suet cake completely, and get this: he detached one of the metal suet holders and managed to run off with it (with the suet cake inside), so now my feeder is lop-sided and completely empty. Long story short, this is a really excellent squirrel feeder... not such a great bird feeder."
5,Great Gift,I bought this for an xmas gift for my boss who loves bird watching. She loved it and the construction was top notch.
4,"Good, but need answers to questions","Pretty good text. Includes interesting real-world applications and easy-to-understand chapter layouts. The one gripe I have is that answers hould be provided to the questions at the end of each chapter (or should be available for purchase in a separate textbook). I have taken two accounting classes in which this book was used and in both classes the teacher had to xerox the answers out of his answer book for the entire class. I learned so much more this way. Rather than trying to figure them out on my own, I could see what the answer was and then figure out WHY."
3,Good wholesome values. Excellent reading for young people,"In his final year of high school Chip Hilton, All-State quarterback, is ready to lead his veteran Valley Falls High School team to a second straight championship. Tragedy strikes when coach Henry Rockwell is hospitalized and is fighting for his life. One of the towns leading citizens and the head of the school board conspire to oust the ""Rock"". They bring in an unscrupulous outsider and install him against Rockwell's recommendation. He quickly causes disharmony and chaos on the team. Hilton is suspended from the team several times. The way that Chip deals with adversity and fights back, makes great reading. It also teaches excellent values to young folks. A must read for Chip Hilton fans"
5,Best book in the series,"I have read just about all of the 20+ volumes in the Hilton series and this has always been my favorite. In addition to being good sports stories, Chip always had to overcome some evil forces to triumph in the end. The evil is so strong in this story, that I want to punch the air in satisfaction when Chip wins out - no matter how many times I have read the book. If you are new to the series, however, I would suggest you start with the first story - ""Touchdown Pass"" - and go from there."
5,I loved this book very much,"I actually read the Angel Chronicles 4 times and counting, Angel is cool, and friendly, and Him and Buffy are in a forbidden love, I advise you to get this book, it is THE best I can't wait for Vol. 2"
4,"Three stories of desire, revenge, temptation and love.","This a very good book. Though I think that Nancy Holder should have chosen differnt stories envolveing angel more, because thease diden't have angel alot in them. It includs eight pages of color photos. All in all it was witten very well.Also Recomemed: The angel Chronicles Vol. 2"
5,This book would be terrific for any Buffy/Angel fan!,"This great book is actually a novelization of three Buffy episodes: Angel, Reptile Boy, and Lie To Me. What's great about this book is how the author is so in tune with all the lingo from the show, and writes in the same style. I would highly reccomend this book to any teen fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, especially those who are big Angel fans."
5,Great for a beginner - especially a kid,"This bat is a good beginner bat. It would be ideal for a kid because it weighs only 155 grams. The handle is well contoured and comfortable for my 6-yr old. The rubber has minimal speed or spin - which is how it should be for a beginner paddle. My kid's game has improved enormously in the last 2 weeks of playing with this (as opposed to a heavier, pricier bat).One thing to note: the rubbers are not ITTF approved if it matters to you.Again, this is a good first bat to learn the basic strokes of the game.Don't invest in more expensive bats if you are new to table tennis. Once you get hooked and get better, you will embark on a racket-buying EJ spree anyway, so don't think this is your last bat!"
3,Size matters.,"The picture was misleading. It showed a picture of the larger Dingo bones that I usually buy. I thought I was getting an extra great bargain. My dogs loved them, but I was a little bit disappointed in the size."
3,Uncovering Sadie's Secrets,"There's something different about the new girl at school, and Bianca is determined to find out what Sadie's secrets are. At first, the greatest risk involved in her intrepid sleuthing is possibly losing her chance with the guy of her dreams, as the investigation continues to bollux Bianca's attempts to make her dates with the boy. However, it becomes rapidly apparent as shady characters begin to appear, that whatever Sadie's secrets are, they're dangerous to know.*** If you've read Nancy Drew and thought she was far too perfect, but still enjoyed the teen aged detective genre, then Bianca is the answer to your quest. She charminly solves a baffling puzzle in a way that teens can relate to. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,.....soothing cosmogrunge from these dudes!!!!!,....exactlly...if you like those roaring soniic youth guitars and kim gordon's hypnptic voice you're gonna love this one....that's for sure my friend....this is a nice side project and if you like good things... so you gotta get it.......
4,"Get Synesthesia, turn it into a double album","Some have described this as an album of light and dark. I think it easiest to compare to ""Synesthesia"", which is an earlier Duo album. They're both about equally good. they both have 12-minute songs (the title track on this CD) as their strongest songs. ""The Glass House"" has a great vibe line running through it. ""Pangea"" isn't easy listening, the song slowly builds to a wave of distortion (distorted organ, actually). It may be repellant the first time through, but I grew to like it. ""Funeral of Dreams"" is another good song. All in all, a fine set, they make a lot of music for a duo, it seems at times Chad Taylor has four arms. Recommended!"
2,Don't eat soy????,"As a subscriber to Muscular Development, I thought this would be a great book to help wth my training and nutrition. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this book that hasn't been covered ad nauseum in the magazine. Limiting simple sugars makes sense, but eliminating all soy products from your diet seems disturbing, given all the health benefits. The Twinlab endorsement is bothersome as well. In spite of these problems, this book may still help those who have never trained or eaten properly before. But as someone already on a serious program I found it disappointing."
2,"Great Picture, Horrible Buzz","We purchased this TV with high hopes. Upon plugging it in there was a loud buzzing coming from the TV. I had a Samsung repairman come out and he said that it was normal and there was nothing they would do about it. So, I promptly arranged for the store where I had bought it to take it back and exchange it for a Samsung LCD; best decision ever, although a bit more money. Stay away from plasmas if you live at elevation, even if the manufacturer says it will work at your altitude."
3,BUUUUZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!,Bought this tv from large box store and buzzed right away. Manufactured 10/2006. went and returned and got replacement ASAP. Got one made 11/2006. The buzzing was 4 times as loud. No more of these Samsungs in my town. I went back and got the 1st TV back and can live with it. Great pic and looks great also. Salesman suggested Monster Cable Noise reeducer/ surge protector. Sells for $180 in store. $80 on Ebay. Will try this next. Seems to make a louder buzzing sound when I attached the Direct TV cable to the TV.
2,okay,"I bought this for my son when he was 8 months old. He is now turning one. He played with it about 3 times and had no interest in it after that. He likes to take the hammer in the tub and throw the balls around, but the light and sound portion of it remains buried in the bottom of his toy box. This toy has no variation to what it will do. If you child gets bored with repetition this is not the toy for them."
1,poor design,We bought this for our 7 month old daughter and ended up taking it back. It is too hard for her to reach in and get the balls out without hurting her hand or pushing them back where she can't get to them. It needs to have a wider opening where the balls drop out.
3,Fun but be cautious,My son had fun playing with this toy on and off for a couple of weeks. BE CAREFUL - just keep an eye on your child because in just a few seconds my son got his foot lodged where the balls come out and we couldn't get it out so we had to cut it off. He's fine but we now we keep that in mind when purchasing any future toys.
1,Extremely Disappointed!!!!,"I am extremely disappointed that this test was not accurate. I followed the directions perfectly - twice. I am a well educated woman who needed to do a prescreen before employment. I know for a fact that it is not accurate because I came up negative in all panels and should not have on opiates. I say this because I am taking opiates currently, and am wearing a patch, so I should of tested positive on opiates, if the test were accurate. Believe me I wanted it to be, for now I have to pay $90.00 at a lab.truly disappointed!This is surely a case where you get what you pay for. I thought this was too good to be true and it was."
5,cute!,Our adopted daughter loved this video! We have been teaching her signs and this is a great supplement.
2,Price keeps going up,I bought this dvd for my 1 year old son. I bought it when the price was 33.00 dollars. It got scratched so I wanted to get him another one. Here I am checking the price and it's 64 bucks. Ridiculous!
1,Tails Don't Stick,Game was for my 4 year old's birthday party. I would pass on this game as the sticker donkey tails did not stick longer than 30 seconds. All of them ended up on the floor.
5,Listening,"Anyone and everyone should read this book. It is not very big, but very powerful. Since God is our Father, we can and should go to Him for help through this life's journey. Thank you Mr. Bush for listening and teaching others how to hear from our Father."
5,one of the best stuffed animals i have!,i love foxes and this stuffed animal is perfect!her name is lady josaphine and i love her.she is the perfect size.and very soft:3
1,A disappointing book with very little real information,"This book is full of photos, but only summary info on each variety of pelargonium. Odd, since Hazel Key has the national collection of pelargoniums within reach at Fibrex Nursery. The colours are not always reliable and sometimes the pictures are clearly upside down. What a pity!"
2,Ripping off a classic story,"There were parts of this book I enjoyed, but I was very annoyed when I read the obviously ripped-off portions of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", a classic deserving at least an acknowledgment. Nowhere is there an author's note or other indication that the plot is lifted from another book. The love story and some of the supporting characters are entertaining, but I cannot stomach such work that does not give (in print) the least credit to the original. I will be very cautious about ordering anything else by Dara Joy. I did enjoy ""Knight of a Trillion Stars"", ""Rejar"", and, especially, ""High Energy"", but this was a disappointment."
4,Sexy scenes!!,"This is the first book I read by Dara Joy & it turned out ok. I'm used to the Sci-fiction 5-7 book 700 page series & wanted a light romantic book to read for a change. This was just so. The story..... well.. there wasn't a story really!! A little romance, a background story about the french revolution & the ""Black Rose"" -a mysterious hero who saved the french aristocrts from the revolutionaries- there were LOTS of steamy sex scenes & some funny scenes as well.. I liked the twist at the end ...... But that's all! Then again I got what I was looking for ;-)I recomend it if you want to read a light book to fuel your imagination & put you in a good mood. I will be re-reading some of the chapters & I'll certainly be looking for Dara Joy's other books!"
2,Great product,"My wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray. With all of the snow we have had, it arrived shortly after Christmas, but just in time to warm her heart for the new year!"
1,save your time,"I am glad I opened this before giving as a gift. The manufacturer has quality control issues. The product that was delivered had only 3 of the 4 rails connected to the glass. The reason why the 4th rail was not connected is that there was no threading drilled in the ""ball"" for the screw to connect the rail to the glass. They did include the screw in the packaging but without the threads it is worthless. Very cheaply made with no quality inspection before shipping. This was an OBVIOUS defect."
2,Broken Upon Arrival,"I received this item and one of the plastic bars was broken. It is not worth it to me to return but I am disappointed because had I chosen to listen to the other reviewer's comments regarding the sticky sticker and fragile quality of the product I might have saved some money.To be fair, had the tray arrived without a broken bar and if I wanted to take the time to remove the sticker (why they didn't put the sticker on the bottom of the mirror i will never know) it appears to be a decent product and worth the $19.00 +/-. I hope this review helps you make an more informed decision. -"
2,Wasn't in it emotionally,"I do door to door sales during the summer time and I thought this book would be of benefit...it was to a certain extent, but it's over use of exclamation points and poorly written text made this hard for me to read. This book has a lot of good pointers if you do cold calls via the telephone, but not significant enough to where you'd want to keep this in your library. Maybe a quick skim read at the library would suffice and satisfy. I simply didn't grasp the emotional energy the writer wanted me to grasp. Looks like according to the other reviews, however, quite a lot of other people really liked it. I'm not a woman, though...so that might be why...even though a lot of this book could be directed toward anyone."
5,book,much better condition than i expected! quick delievery. this book has been out of print for a long time and i was so suprised to find it used and for such a great price!
5,WOW: RONNIE AT LAST!,"For Ronnie Spector fans everywhere, this book has it all. Her early days in New York City, the beginning of the Ronettes, their spectacular number 1 hit BE MY BABY, her nightmare of booze and obsession while married to that creep Phil Spector, and her triumphant return to her first love of music and singing. If you want a fascinating look at the girl groups in Rock and Roll history, then you want to read this book. She writes in a down-to-earth way that makes you feel like a good friend is telling you a heart-wrenching story of pain and loss, of fear and courage. Good going, Ronnie! We love you."
4,The Queen of Sixties Pop Stars,"If you're interested in early Sixties pop music in general or Phil and Ronnie Spector in particular you'll enjoy this book. Ronnie's tale is a classic rags to riches to hell story. I first saw (and fell in love) with Ronnie when she toured with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes back in the 70's. I ended up touring England with her myself, playing guitar and keyboards, in 1991 - a real experience. It was quite a surreal trip reading this book and traveling with her at the same time. Ronnie told me there were many other stories about Phil, and many affairs she had, that could NOT be mentioned in the book. Too bad - that would have made it even juicier! I have not seen the updated version of this book, but heartily recommend it."
2,C# Primer - Less Than Practical,"If you're accustomed to Lippman's previous works, this book will fall hopelessly short of expectation. I found this book to be lacking not just in content, but in direction. The ""practical approach"" employed by Lippman I found to be less-than-practical. The text feels hurried, does not flow well, and the sample code is replete with errors and inconsistencies. There is also alot of useless prose geared towards warming the junior programmer to object-oriented theory. This is not a good book for someone coming from a C++ or Java background hoping to come up to speed on C#. If, on the other hand, you enjoy long-winded hyperbole on ""What is a constructor,"" with ailing code samples to match, this book is for you."
3,"Not bad, could be clearer on the trickier points","Overall this book is decent, if you have programming experience.I wish it would contrast C# to other languages; no reason to have to read thru a whole explanation, if he would just say, ""this feature works just like Java..."".The biggest flaw is that for some of the stranger concepts, he doesn't really build up a sufficient explanation. I am a very experienced OO Architect and Java coder, yet I found his explanations of such subjects as ""a Polymorphic Query Language"" incomplete.With few exceptions however the book is well written, had minimal typos, and was acceptable"
3,"Reasonable book, but overpriced, there are better choices!","This is a perfectly reasonably book however there are much better books. I found the treatment a bit eccentric and not as good for learning C# as Liberty's book. Liberty's book is not only better at teaching C#, it is significantly cheaper *and* covers far more material. There is no reason to buy Lippman over Liberty since with Liberty you get more material, a better teacher and spend less $.Moreover, I find it impossible to imagine somebody who doesn't know C++ learning C# from this book. In sum, while this book has some useful points, I would pass on this overpriced book. I would buy Liberty's book if you wish to learn C# and you are not a super experienced C++ or Java programmer. If you are a super experienced C++ or Java, then you should just buy Troelsen's book and skip both Liberty and Lippman."
4,"Easy install, works as advertised","I had this cover mounted in about an hour, had no problems. Accessing the bed can be a bit of a pain, but I knew this when I bought a top with snaps. $$$ vs convenience, $$$ wins!"
5,This thing really works,I was really worried when i bought it that it wouldnt work but it did!!! YAY! It works very well and it does not overheat thank god.
1,Horrible,"I bought this product hoping to replace my 5 year old Powerbook G4 charger without breaking the bank. However, you get what you pay for with this one. It is too good to be true. After using it twice the adapter part partially melted! Not only was this awful because it stopped working, but this could have been a serious safety hazard for my roommates and myself! Never again! Guess it's worth spending the extra $[...] to get something that won't kill you."
3,Pop A Filter,Don't care for it. Worked ok when filters that came with it were there but anything else it doesn't work with.
5,Excellent,"Excellent movie, highly recommended, even to one who is not a baseball nut, as the personalities are very likable. It makes me want to read Dickey's book, which I have also heard good things about. Baseball needs more people like these men."
1,Not worth the money!,I just wanted to let everyone know that this toy is not worth the money. My daughter got this toy for her first birthday and only plays with it once in a while because she gets annoyed with it. For one thing it doesn't stay standing. When she leans on it to erase her drawing the whole thing collapses and one or more times she's been hurt because of it. I really think this was a poor design for a toy. You can't even make a full picture on it because the blue paint fills in the other things that you have already drawn. I'm sorry I ever bought this toy and I will make sure that I check the reviews before I by something I'm not sure of again.
2,Don't bother with this one unless your child is at least 3,"The age factor on this toy is VERY wrong. I thought it was such a great idea but as the other reviewers have said, you have to push down so hard on the screen to make an impression that younger children won't be able to play with it. My little one is almost 3 now and has had it for 1.5 years. He's finally able to use it and actually enjoys it. It's really cute when he makes an impression of his foot! That should give you some idea on how hard it is to make an impression on the screen - he stands on it! It's fun for a little while, but it can get boring too so all-in-all, I would pass on this toy and look for something more user friendly for younger children."
4,Magical Fingerpaint,My daughter liked this toy. It plays music when the screen is touched with your fingers or the stamps that are included. The things I do not like about it are that the stamps do not really work that well and you have to push hard with your fingers to make a real impression. (The screen is that gel stuff that you must move around in order to make a picture).
2,very dissapointed,I was really excited about this toy but after I got it home I was so let down. The toy doesnt keep my children too entertained as it does not work very well. When they go to fingerpaint you arent able to draw a picture or anything the screen doesnt hold the picture it just doesnt hold up to the advertisements. when you draw one line and go to draw another the first line you drew gets erased by the top layer of the screen.
2,Spend your money on something else...,"This looked like fun - but not for our 1 year old. When she leans on the roller bar to ""erase"", the brace which holds it at an angle collapses and she falls forward. It's not easy even for an adult to draw a picture because as you ""draw"" the blue goo tends to fill in other lines already drawn. Maybe she'll like it more when she's older. All in all - a big disappointment. As an update to this review - she's almost 2 now and we still don't like this toy. The drawing shape pieces stick so much that even I have a hard time getting them out. She has given up trying to play with it."
4,"Great toy, playable for years!","I found this Easel excellent for my son at 11 mos, and even now that he is 4 he still loves it! My 18 month old twins have been playing with it for almost a year and it keeps getting better! They had no problem drawing on the gel, and the music is a real bonus. We have even used it with older kids as an extra pictonary board, to play, drawing-charades."
1,Not recommended for little fingers...,Colors on it are attracting to children but watch out my little girls fingers got stuck in the sliding piece..... not worth it.
3,Neat Concept,"My 2-year-old daughter enjoys the music, and the blue plastic-encased ""paint"" is a neat concept, but, in reality, it doesn't work well. It can show a finger-press and a line but it doesn't draw like a Magna-Doodle or an Etch a Sketch."
1,Very disappointing. Definitely not for an infant.,"I just bought this for my younger son for his first birthday. The package says for 9 mos +. We have had it less than a week and have problems.First, the music actually made my son upset when he touched it so I had to shut it off. Also, the soft cover needs alot of pressure for the colors to be seen. Even the plastic shapes that come with the toy don't work unless I press hard and twist them a little. This is definitely not for an infant. The picture on the package is very misleading.As others have noted, the stand is not very sturdy at all. In fact my son tried to use the toy to lean on and stand himself up. My 3-year old actually was able to remove part of the stand from the holder. I should have left the toy in it's box to see if my younger son would even play with it. That way I could have returned it."
1,What's all the hype about?,"I'll be brief and to the point. I have excellent reading skills, but the promise of being able to read an entire book within minutes was too much to pass. Unfortunately, the actual photoreading technique, as far as I am concerned, is nonsense. It simply doesn't work. What can actually work, especially if you're not good or experienced in reading, is the secondary techniques that Paul Scheele gives to help you with your reading and to prepare you to photoread (mind maps, keywords, associations.) But this is not photo-reading, it's something most people already know, especially if they've spent years and years in college. The actual photoreading technique didn't work for me and the rest of the clues he provides, I already knew. I returned the course."
3,butterfly handbook reads more like a textbook,"This was one of the books I purchased when looking for ""the"" butterfly guide. It is fairly comprehensive, for all that it's quite small, covering everything from lepidopteran biology to gardening for butterflies, but what's really lacking is the pictures. There is only one small glossy insert of pictures, and it only shows some adult butterflies and moths - no eggs, no larvae, no pupae. I much prefer The Family Butterfly Book by Rick Mikula."
5,Sixth Season,Again my son enjoys watching the reruns of Boy Meets World and is looking forward to watching all of them
5,Spade hits Comic Gold in Take the Hit,"David Spade turned out to be surprisingly funny in this one. Generally, I am not a David Spade fan: I don't care much for The Rules of Engagement but Take the Hit was Spade's funniest and best performance. The plus side is he does not discuss subject he has no interest in; such as politics and he plays to his strengths, such as naughty sex jokes and taboo subjects. His best bits is his joke about Jon Benet Ramsey. Your jaw will drop in shocked disbelief. And his rant against the USA network for editing B-rated films which contain a lot of nudity down to PG cleanliness had me laughing off of my seat!"
3,colt book,I was recommended this book and I will say to the next person not to bother. Plenty of good books out and this one is not one of them.
5,Superb overview of the topic!,"I found this book in the library, and have decided to purchase it. Sweeney goes into sufficient detail to enable the reader to diagnose handgun problems and speak intelligently to a gunsmith about them. Step-by-step instructions are presented for doing your own work - or for deciding that you want a professional to do it. He also discusses what work is best left to professionals, customizing, enhancements, etc. Great book for any pistol owner!"
1,worthless,"unless you already know all the parts and peices of a gun and how to take it down to exploded view level of dissasembly and put it back this manual is worthless, i got a willson combat trigger for my 1911 i turned to to the section for installing it, it says remove trigger and install new one and went in detail over how to file it down if it didn't fit right but nothing on how to actually get the trigger out or get it back in, same thing with my revolver it says to remove the cylinder but dosen't say how to remove the cylinder, its like a chiltons manual that says remove transmission but dose not go any further than that, this book is fine if you already know what your doing but if you know what your doing then you would not need a manual to begin with"
5,excellente,"verdaderamente un gran libro de liderazgo. Rick warren encierraen este libro los verdaderos valores y qualidades del lider cristiano usando como ejemplo el personaje de Nehemias. Tiene que leerlo, es de gran bendicion para todo aquel que aspira a hacer un gran lider"
5,Still The Best,"I know people have a lot of different opinions when it comes to the subject of which pocket knife is better and for what reason. I am a collector and user of knives of all sorts, camping, whittling, a tool, and just plain enjoying the feel of a good knife. I have owned a knife of some sort for over fifty years and Case has always been my choice when I could afford one. The Jack style is the best, for me, for all around use. More than two blades are cumbersome, one is not enough for most uses. The quality of Case has been unparallelled for my lifetime and so, as long as I am capable of using and appreciating a good pocket knife, Case will always be the ""buddy"" of choice."
2,Too Much Sex,"I stumbled on Lynna Banning's ""The Courtship"" and really liked it. It had a lot of romance without lots of sex. I read ""Angel of Devil's Camp"" expecting something similar, but it was teeming with sex. I did like the plot at first, but by the end I just wanted to get it over with. Not my favorite."
5,Role Models in Fantasy,"I came across this book in a used book store, and when I finished, I was astounded that I had never run across this author before. As the mother of three sons, I found the lessons of this story about honor, responsibility and commitment to be very valuable. Perhaps it is old-fashioned to want those virtues for your child in today's world, but I intend to try and impart them. This book was as exciting and action filled as any Lloyd Alexander ever wrote, with a bitter-sweet ending highlighting the theme of sacrifice of self for a greater ideal."
5,Ark II the complete TV Series,Here is a good opertunity to see the episodes you missed on the first go round. It is an excellent print of this TV serial. Thanks for the speedy delivery.
3,Cage Stand,"After I received this product I quickly realized that $62 was too much to pay for it. Easily assembled, no directions required but very very flimsy and unsteady. Once I put the cages in it did sturdy up a bit more but it was a challenge to get the cages to fit. The bars were not cut correctly so they do not fit as snugly as they should either. The bottom tier is too close to the floor for any birds comfort so a firm piece of plywood works great for a shelf. If you do not have to worry about the cage being bumped by dogs or kids it is great, but it takes very little to shake the whole thing and ""rattle"" the birds with it."
5,Johnny Cash,If you love Johnny Cash's music you will love this beautiful CD. What more can I say except I really miss him and June.
5,On nonstop for a while,"This was repeating nonstop on my player for a while. If you like garage rock and trashy pop punk, you'll like the Pee Chees. Whiny lyrics, crashing guitars, and all the stuff you expect. Doesn't try that hard to be badass, and, thus, it rocks better than your average rock stars. I like that song, Beer City, a lot. It's almost ten years since I was hooked, and it still sticks in my head."
3,"Bad outcome, not completely sellers fault.","I judged house size on given dimensions; house was too small because given dimensions are external, and internal dimensions are significantly smaller.They were willing to accept return for refund, but available shipping options were greater cost than house was worth. I ended up selling on craigslist to recover cost. Dimensions should be more clearly stated, including explicit interior dimensions."
1,I hate this soap. It's so gross.,"I cannot stand this soap. I've always loved using olive oil on my skin, so I thought I'd try this soap. I figured I'd love it. But I didn't, and here's why...1. It smells like tires. Like dirty, nasty black rubber tires.2. This soap comes in a giant hard block that is very awkward to hold and use unless you cut it up.3. The bar is dark green, and leaves a dark green slime all over your shower.4. Although this is all natural, it irritated the hell out of my delicate areas.So overall, this giant clunky bar of tire rubber is going to irritate the hell out of your skin and make you smell bad. Stay away."
1,Turns into hideous green goo!,"This soap started off pleasant enough, and it seemed like I was really getting a huge bar of soap for the money. It was gentle and effective, but after a month or so, the bar began seriously melting and turning into hideous, slimy green goo that got all over my shower. The goo still cleans more or less the same as when it was in bar form, but I will never buy this soap again, or any other from Kiss My Face. Prior to the meltdown, I would have rated this soap three stars.Just for the record, I have never had this problem with any other soap in my life (whether regular, ""natural"" or organic), so I have no idea what Kiss My Face is doing wrong with this formula. Buyer beware!"
2,Final product was just ok. Process was horrendous.,"Product arrived with the etching not complete. Several attempts were made to contact seller by phone with messages left as well as by e-mail. No reply was received. I finally was able to get seller on the phone about a week and a half before Christmas. I was promised he would ship a replacement out right away and not wait for my return to get there since I could not ship the return for a few days from the time we spoke. He obviously did not do that, since item was not received until January 3 in the same box we returned the defective one in! When Christmas had come and gone, I left him 2 more messages over a week asking about the status of the delivery. No response was received. When the item was finally received, the etching was still not complete. One cat is still missing, and there is not as much detail and the image is not as clear as in the photo. Would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Nearly Perfect,"I have always had a removeable showerhead for as long as I can remember. This model was a great price, and it is SOLID contruction. The one problem I have is that the showerhead is fairly heavy, so that when you place it into the holder, it weighs the holder down to the lowest position. No matter how hard you tighten the screws it will always fall down to the lowest position so it is not adjustible"
1,Cheap Plastic,"While installing the hose, it was broken with bare hands.All parts are not metal. I am very disappointed with this cheap delta product. I had to return it, and purchased a hand shower with metal parts from a local store."
3,"OK, but...","Delta is synonymous with ""spare parts"" needed. 'nuf said? Maybe not on this application - if it is used in parallel with a standard shower head which I do in my house. My hose unit is more for washing my dog so is not used every day and I would need fewer spares. This model seems not to be capable of being mounted parallel.I have stayed with Moen or Kohler and found them worthwhile in the long run. And today I would buy a water-conserving head for sure.Delta is famous for having good widely available parts. It's just that they are needed too often IMHO.On the other hand I wouldn't run away from this sale either if you don't have a need for a longer lasting product.How's that for straddling the fence?"
5,Prequel to either/or,"I gave this album 5 stars despite its inconsistency. Some of the songs are a bit weak, but are made up for by some of his best work. ""Christian Brothers"" is amazing. Mr. Smith of course peaked on his next album, either/or. Then he got a little inconsistent with xo, and so forth with figure 8. His work is best when raw acoustic guitar/vocals."
4,Very Interesting Book,"This is a book definitely worth reading. Interesting to get the insights from someone who has been where the author has. The writing is far from mindblowing, but the story will keep you turning the pages. Not sure if I believe everything Collins wrote in this book or not. If what he says about warning the federal government is indeed true, well, it doesn't surprise me a bit. After reading the book you probably won't think much of this guy whether you're a Chechyn fighter or a conservative American. After reading this, you will have learned some things you most likely didn't know, some of which will shock you."
4,Really Good Book,"I read this book to understand the thinking of the insurgent and to learn a little bit about organizational structure. The author's account makes clear how disorganized this type of warfare can be, at every level. His arrival, training, the command and control structure of mujahideen organizations, supplies and logistics all depict how this type of warfare depends as much on individuals and their commitment as on weaponry, tactics and luck. What I disliked was the books poor editing-it could've been MUCH better.This is an interesting text to compare against other accounts such as John Reed's ""Insurgent Mexico"" and the theoretical frameworks of Guevara and Mao."
3,Good advice put dated,While the book has some great advice and positive inspiration. I thought it was a bit dated for 2007. The forms on the CD were old and lacking. I had made a batch of forms before I read the book that were much better. I would like to see someone do a book like this focusing on a specific trade.
1,What a regal waste of time,"What a monumental waste of paper! The writers are academics, and it shows. Their analysis has fatal flaws from a practical standpoint, and their conlusions are irrelevant. An example - they say that all short sale indicator are losers (they looked at a bull market). They dont even look at how the indicator did relative to the market. What's the point? Steer clear."
2,Every Budget my Tushie!,"In my naivety, I believed the blurb on the front of this book, ""every budget"" and ""off the beaten path""- but when I received it I learned that this obviously refers to every budget upper middle class or better, and off the beaten path only because only about 5 people can afford to eat in restaurants where the main course is $40. Not only do I feel excluded as a social worker and a budget traveler- but the highlights on things to do were practically absent- the section on Burlington, VT is only 3 pages long, with only 9 or 10 hotel and restaurants combined listed! Hello- I've never been there and I know there's a lot more going on. That's one other thing- I personally dislike having dining/lodging listings combined- I mean, they're certainly not the same thing, and in my world food always deserves it's own listing. So, if you're a well to do bunch who's looking to spend some money and not do much else, this is the book for you. Enjoy!"
3,odd & quirky,"I love short stories. This one kept my attention almost until the end. The end was odd and deflating.I read lots of short stories, and the most interesting ones I will re-read to my husband when we have time together. This one will not be re-read. It's interesting, but for me not worth reading twice. I loved the first three-fourths of the story though. Detailed and funny.One of my favorite short stories is ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" which is also free here on amazon kindle. I greatly recommend it over this one. But if you've got some time on your hands, and ready for fun read with an apathetic ending, read on!"
3,Bartleby,"In my opinion, Bartleby gets a bit boring sometimes, but maybe that's because I was sleepy when I read it. In general, the storyline is somewhat unique. Turkey and Nippers are copyists or scriveners while Ginger Nut, a boy of twelve, does odd jobs. The narrator notes these eccentricities, but excuses them. The narrator, torn between pity and exasperation, also discovers that Bartleby apparently has no home or friends, and lives in the office. Bartleby, however, only repeats his mantra, and the narrator eventually fires him. Bartleby, however, continues to haunt the premises, causing the lawyer considerable embarrassment.I would give Bartleby three out of five stars, because I really didn't think it was that amazing, because I got lost in it."
4,Not Moby Dick,"funny and poignant, fascinating characters, interesting picture of New York in the 1850s, a quick read and the Kindle version is free!"
5,like an old friend,Reciving my new k-bar was like welcoming an old friend home.It is exactly like the one I carried in the Marines from 1963 until 1968.The addition of the hard case is a real plus.It even smells like my old one.Great knife and great service from the dealer.Arrived in a short amount of time.I would recommend this dealer to anyone looking for that special knife.
2,NOT POWERFULL ENOUGH,"First point, this is advertised as producing 260ft/lbs of torque, however right on the package, it reads 230. Also, on the high setting, I seem to get about 100 to 120 ft/lbs out of it, if I leave it on the bolt for a bit. There is no way this thing ever has, or ever will produce the 230 shown on the package, and certainly not the 260ft/lbs as advertised here."
4,Large Music Rocks!!,"A friend of mine from New York told me about this CD because I love all the Naked Music Stuff. I guess Large is more of a DJ label, but this CD rocks. It is very laid back and jazzy but not boring. The best track is Kerri Chandler-Summer Love."
2,The sigils are poorly done in this particular book,"The sigils in this particular book are so poorly done, that they are indistinguishable, rendering practice of much of the Art in this book impossible. The best grimoire for the 6th & 7th Books is by Joseph Peterson and published by Ibis."
3,What was I reading?,"I thought I was intelligent but this book put me in my place. I was able to get through the book because it was written in english, but what difference does that make. The book gets three stars because being able to put words like that in sentences is an accomplishment unto itself."
5,"Simple, Horrific, and Spooky","This was the very first book I ever read cover to cover (without being assigned to read it. ) I loved it. We passed it around class, its a must read for anyone that likes true crime."
5,Bad Party,The fact that the Dead Milkmen reference this book in one of their songs is enough to let you know that it is a quality read.
4,Good for artists,The height of this is good for someone who works at a drawing table. Much better than a taboret and cheaper by hundreds. However the wheels are not up to the task of moving it once it's fully loaded. They work fine for the smaller versions.
3,"Sturdy, Adorable....yet she doesn't use it!","My 2-y-o loves rocking horses, except the one we got her for her birthday in January. Of course, right? She IS two...The Palomino is the right height for toddlers, it's a modern design and very attractive, so we don't mind having it visible in the living room. It's compact--a rocker, not suspended within a frame. The only thing that I can think of that might turn off my daughter is that in the name of safety, the rockers are kind of long and not all that curved; I think older horses rocked more and harder.We've tried it on both carpet and tile with similar results.Since it's an expensive toy, we're disappointed that her initial delight was short-lived, and we're really hoping that she tries again."
3,Meh,"Ok,so I'm no luthier...But I didn't find this stuff to be all that helpful. So if you are an part-time ameteur trying to make the pegs on that cheap violin you bought out curiosity (yep, I bought it too)stop slipping, this won't help you much. I may try drying it out a bit like the first entry said, but I'm not taking my $50 violin to a luthier :)."
4,:),This is a great product. Cheap and easy to use. The only bad thing is we have kids and they love to play with it. They immediately unscrewed and lost one of the mister fittings but we found replacements at Ace Hardware and now are banned from touching the brass fittings. I also wish it were a little taller so the mist falls better but you can't beat this option for the price. We usually use it when we're sitting anyway so it works fine.
2,mis-packaged twice,"I was hoping to give this product a rave review in my anticipation of cooking with a new larger manufactured wok, but twice I ordered the same product and twice it came with the wrong lid... one 2 inches in diameter too small so it would have sat in the food. Sadly it was returned... twice."
1,Just western cartoons with big eyes,This book is ok for someone who just watches Yu-ge-ou and wants to doodle on his notebook but not for anyone who really wants to draw. Its flat coloring also takes away depth from the pictures and makes it look like a cheap cartoon. Not recomended for anyone who really wants to learn the true elements of anime/manga.
3,The American POV,"I agree with a lot reviewers who say that this is not best on the subject, for instance this book speaks to you as you already know how to draw well, it just tells you how to change the features an make them look manga-like, but some drawings are not even manga-like! I compared the drawings of this one with the ones on How to Draw Anime Basics for Begginers and Beyond and the Manga Mania drawings would be in the Begginers class with a lot of the same mistakes.Those were the low points, which fortunately were on beginning of the book, the mecha section is nice, as the camera angles treat and the theory of the comic style, as I said this book is made for those with experience with American comic drawing who want to be introduced in the Manga style, this could help them but in my humble opinion the are better books for that."
2,"Okay for beginners, but...","As another reviewer mentioned, Christopher Hart's anime how-to books would be best for people who are very new to drawing or are in the age 8-13 range. Anyone who has had some experience drawing anime, however, needs something more advanced. The art is okay, but not as good as many of the amateur manga artists that I know, and the lines seem to have a pixely quality, like they were done on Microsoft Paint. There are some good examples to copy from, and some figure building techniques. But Hart's manga style looks too much like Digimon and his character examples are kind of clichéd (Pink-haired J-Pop girl, Deedlit-ish elf girl, boy with robot pal, etc.) I would recommend the Japanese How To Draw Manga books over this one for a more in-depth learning experience."
2,dont buy if you have his other books,I am a huge fan of christopher hart;i have most of his books!The other books in the manga mania series are awesome!but this book was really bad the art was horrible except for maybe 5 pictures.I did not like the book and i regret buying it...So if you want a good manga book get another book by him like shoujo mania.Manga Mania Shoujo: How to Draw the Charming and Romantic Characters of Japanese Comics (Manga Mania)
2,What the...?,"After buying this book, I was mildly amused by his methods...!His style is poor compared to what I would call true MANGA,and it's very VERY western-styled...I like his eye-section though, and he's succeded in takinga few basics, but he's far, VERY far from being anywhere nearproffesional! I'm so lucky to be able to learn to draw, from whatI see, and not tutorials, because this book has almost none.I would NOT recommend buying the How To Draw Manga books insteadthough, from what I've seen from them, they're too expensiveand not very good either at teaching you to draw, they needfar more examples, like MANGA-MANIA has, so a mix betweenthe two would be welcome."
2,What are his qualifications?,"It's amazing how this guy, who has very little experience drawing comics (let alone manga) professionally, has managed to make a lucrative career out of writing ""how to"" books on cartooning. As many reviewers have noted, Hart draws very poorly. In fact, one gets the impression that he is not even trying. He just dumps another book on the market and waits for the royalties to roll in. By shamelessly jumping on the manga bandwagon, though, he has bitten off far more than he can chew. I personally know dozens of amateur Japanese artists who draw far better than Hart, but who would never presume to write a ""how to"" book. This is what in Japanese would be called ""kodomo damashi,"" which means ""something only a child could be fooled by."" And judging by the reviews, it seems it is indeed mostly children who have been fooled into buying this and Hart's other books."
4,One of the best,"I have a sence for anime and this is my second favorite. It has good discriptions and has awesome pictures. In weeks you will fluently know Anime. Also my cousin thinks it is the BEST anime book in the world, but that is him. I would give it a 5 star book but it kind of confused me in some places so it gets a 4. But this book gave me the chance to find my dream, the dream to be an animation artist!!"
1,Manga... Riiiiiiiight,"I'm not a huge Manga fan, but I am an Anime fan. (There is a difference) The only reason I bought this book is because it's the only one I can get like it in my area. If you read the back it gives a miss leading idea about what the book is about. It has NOTHING in it on how to draw Manga. Just gives you vague ideas and references. It really does speak to you like you already know what your doing (I'm very green, nuff said). I would only recommend it for someone who is already skilled at drawing and knows what their doing. Other wise, avoid this book at all costs. There are much better books on this topic out there. Besides, his style is to American to look Manga. And that's pretty sad."
3,"OK, but not all it's cut out to be...","I bought this book, mainly because it seemed to be the only manga book at the Chapters I went to...anyhoo, let's get down right to the point--this book is ok, even great, if you are NOT particularly looking for the ""Japanese"" manga, but if you ARE looking for that ""Japanese"" style, it's...well, somehow, it has too much western style to it. I'm not really sure how that happened (especially the colors! whoever painted it totally ruined the Japanese-manga-eyes and the style), but it's more of a how to try to draw Japanese manga for western people.In conclusion, if you're an expert at Japanese manga/anime and wants to learn more about it, I definitely wouldn't recommend this book. However, if you're just a beginner who's from western country or have no idea what Japanese anime is, then this book may be a good way to start off."
3,Somewhat helpful!,"I found the book very helpful for drawing anime style cartoon characters. I'm making an anime parody! This book is helpful on how to draw a manga character's head from many angles! To be honest even though I know what ""authentic manga"" is supposed to look like I find the style in this book to be just as appealing as art drawn by professional manga artists in japan I guess the fact that it doesn't look ""authentic"" is what gives this book it's charm if you ask me. I do feel it's lacking in instruction but I learned a lot from this book how to draw the head from various angles and how to draw manga eyes was very helpful indeed. I only recommend this book for more experienced artists."
4,Decide the extent to use each J2EE technology in your design,"I am designing a web site for my own business that will provide an on-line service for which organizations can purchase subscriptions for their members.This book quickly finalized my decision on the extent to which I would use the following technologies in my design. JSP, Servlets, Stateful Session Beans, Stateless Session Beans, Entity Beans, CMP, and BMP. This is exactly why I bought the book. It also gave me some unexpected insights such as how JMS, JNDI, and JTA could be helpful.I am an experienced programmer, but my Java experience consists of a few months of servlet development. If you have already done a commercial application using these technologies, then this book has nothing to teach you."
1,Memoir? Please!,"I knew the author and his family. I attended S.S. Peter & Paul too and if memory serves me right, I think his mother IS still alive. I thought memoirs were supposed to be true? Guess this author didn't get that memo. Not everything is fiction though. He did have an affair with his teacher that everyone knew about but shame on the author for lying about ""Father Tom""!! He knows damn well that &$%!# did not happen. What a disappointment!"
1,Not a good one...,It worked for few minutes and fuse failed very soon. I had to return it. I am still looking for good voltage converter.
5,Works!,"Installed this product in a Gateway MX3560 laptop to replace the one I removed and use in my Dell Inspiron 4100, which was using a PCMCIA card. Both work flawlessly running windows XP and Debian Etch."
5,Perfect with Linux,"I have to agree with an earlier review. If you don't know what ndiswrapper is, buy this and keep it that way. And never buy anything from Broadcom ever again. My start with Linux would have been a whole lot smoother had I done that. At least it forced me to make friends with the terminal early.Installation was easy on a Dell Inspiron B120 and the card was recognized instantly and automagically using Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron). My connection is now much stronger than with the old painful workaround using the Broadcom card. Enthusiastically recommended."
1,Don't buy this is you have an HP,"The description here on Amazon does not say that this is not for HP, Compaq, IBM, or Toshiba laptops. I bought this and figured out the hard way."
3,A DOG CHASING ITS OWN TAIL,"Griffin's hair turned white pursuing answers in this field. He lists 800 books in his 45 page Bibliography! It is a real test of the reader's vocabulary: perceptual consciousness, reflective consciousness, epiphenomenon, cognitive ethology and on and on and on.A class in semantics may have clarified the author's thoughts. Everything he talks about, e.g., whether animals and computers can think, is based on his or others verbal definitions without much evidence to verify these beliefs. It is obvious that every creature has its own view of the world. And equally obvious that there is no way to compare the worldview of a bee or ant to a human worldview because of greatly differing boundary conditions. I doubt that a long recitation of ones ignorance will prove useful in the grand scheme of life. And one simply can't define oneself up to a higher state of knowledge. This writing reminds me of a dog chasing its own tail."
1,Not good value for money,"This is a very one sided and very SAP-oriented book, but it will give you an indication of the SAP-blessed way of doing things. Just be aware there are lots of falsehoods and generalizations, e.g. ""mainframes cannot connect to the internet."", when one of the first successful things of the internet was LISTSERVs from the IBM VM operating system long before SAP could even pronounce let alone spell internet. Like most SAP stuff it pats SAP liberally on the back and paints themselves as the conveyers of ""THE TRUTH"". If you read it with a critical eye and believe about one half it is a good book and at the very least when people start slinging the buzzwords which is a favourite pastime in the SAP world you will be able to accurately gauge there knowledge."
5,great service,Love the book- great addition to our adventure book collection. Arrived as scheduled and in great shape. Thanks so much.
2,"get what you pay for,","shift knob was packaged ok came with mounting adaptors, and battery'sknob looks good , heres where the buts come in ,but the screws that mount it in place strip easily ,but one eye illuminates WAY brighter then the other ,but the screw that holds part of it on keeps turning out ,think i paid 14 bucks or so for this you get what you pay fori use it on my can am quad, so alot of vibration , but the screws would do the same in my trucks as well iam sure"
1,Not so Hot,"Stay away from this version of The Mystery of the Leaping Fish. The quality is abysmal. The DVD appears to have been recorded from a 10th generation VHS tape.I had seen bits and pieces of this film on a PBS broadcast about Tod Browning. The video quality of the parts of the film that were shown were excellent. This DVD, however, is a major disappointment. Clearly, a better/restored version exists out there somewhere that would be worth searching for."
1,"Bah, Humbug!",Don't bother - none of these stories ever grabs a reader's interest (and I'm generally an easy sell).
5,Excellent annotated collection of Karpov's games.,"Mednis' books are usually pretty good, and this is one of his best. The annotations are insightful with regard to Karpov's style of play, and instructive to the intermediate player. Descriptive notation. Typical Dover high quality paperback. Probably one of my top 10 ""desert island"" books."
3,Easy Projects but......,"Well written and authoritatve book with great pictures and diagrams. However, many of the steps that are given are not EASY without a significant amount of experience and a fair amount of skill. The tools required may be beyond the normal household DIYS person. All and all I would recommend it for a intermediate level wood worker"
1,Don't bother...,"The concept for this book sounds interesting, the reality of this book is anything but. Amateur writing bogs it down, and the B-movie plotline never goes anywhere interesting. The hardcore fanatism of cryptozoology fans accounts for the positive reviews on this page, as they will protect anything that seemingly provides any sort of public awareness on the subject. But judging this book solely on its literary qualifications, and not the initial subject matter, reveals the truth about this book, and that is the fact that it's simply sub-par in every way. Don't waste your time and money when there are better books to be found."
3,John Hughes style teen comedy - but with twenty-somethings,Pretty decent John Hughes style teen comedy set in the Eighties (but with twenty-somethings instead of teens - not that that changes much.)
3,Take this DVD home tonight,"For the most part, an entertaining movie. Starts out kinda slow, but gets better as the movie progresses. Some really funny stuff scattered throughout the flick. Wold recommend this DVD."
2,Like a drunken barf drenched one night stand,"Take me home tonight contains lackluster dull uninspired dialogue performed by 2nd rate actors with an 80's soundtrack featured as a dominating tool to make up for this and to bluntly remind you that this is happening in the 80's.Well the soundtrack can't save a movie that is dead on arrival.Take me home tonight lacks what 80's director John Hughes had in spades and that's interesting characters, good dialogue, quality story, actors with charisma and the personality to bring a quality script to life, actors that make you care about the characters they are playing, and most of all fun.Seek Ferris Bueler's Day Off and Sixteen Candles for proof of John Hughes craft or if you want a more risque teenage comedy/drama then seek out the artful classic Paul Brickman movie Risky Business and skip this piece of trash.It may sound cliche but they really don't make em' like they used to."
5,GREAT,I'll Make This Short And Simple I Am A Very Picky Movie Person And This Movie Was Great!!! Loved It!!! Really Funny!!!
3,I was in the movie,"When I was in the Navy, several of us were invited to a rodeo near the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. It was part of the filming for J. W. Coop. I keep looking for myself in the film. Things were moving too fast."
5,awsome,I am completely intothe bone books.It's an awsome book.It only took me 2 weeks to read all9 volumes!! I highly recommend thisbook to anyone!
5,Color is even better.,"This is an epic comic book. Think 'Lord Of The Rings' with a comic twist... at least at the beginning. The story is as old as it is fresh. Good vs. evil and a quest. Unlikely hero and his sidekicks. The tale starts out with some very funny story arcs interspersed with drama to further the plot.My personal favorite is the first story arc where we are introduced to Fone Bone and his cousins Smiley and Phoney. And we are also introduced to the valley and the protagonists inhabiting it. This is the funniest story arc and to me the funnest. I wish that the humor could have been sustained through the whole series. It became just a bit too serious and tense further in.I love the original comics in black and white but I have to admit that the color version is, if anything, better.'Bone' is a great read for all ages."
2,Annoyed with the publishers,"Why did the publisher put all the stories in one edition, and take away the COLOR in the drawings??? Half of the artistic delivery, is the drawings....and an important part of that is the artist's use of color. I wanted the entire collection, and to be able to savor the full experience of story, drawing, color, all as was given in the separate editions. When I received the book, I was thrilled until I opened it and saw that they had given me a product minus half the experience. And that is not really made clear in the description. You think you're buying the collected equivalent of the separate editions. But you're not....Most disappointing."
2,Don't buy! Do yourself a favor and buy the color graphic novels!,"This is buy no means a review of the series itself, my review here is regarding the quality of the pages that this is printed on.You will be very disappointed by how THIN the pages are. You can see the artwork on the next page! It is extremely distracting to try to read this book when you can see what is happening on the next page. It's cool to have this in it's original black and white incarnation, but do yourself a favor and buy the colored versions from Scholastic. The paper quality on the scholastic versions is now graphic novel thick almost semi gloss paper. The colors pop off the pages, they look amazing. The color adds even more depth to the story.So please don't order this...order the more expensive but totally worth it color versions.TIP: If your kids bring home those Scholastic book flyers from their school, they are selling the complete 9 books for $50!Hope this helps anyone on the fence..."
2,Where's the color?,"My 8-year old son tore through the first 4 Bone books and I figured why not just get the rest of the series in one place so that he'd have it all. Unlike the individual volumes which had very rich color, however, this is entirely black and white. My son was very disappointed. I'll probably end up having to buy all the individual volumes anyway."
3,How come it isn't in color?,The Canadian version is sold in color and in smaller chapter versions. Why not here in the USA? Grandson from Canada was not happy.
5,Great content and value,"This HUGE book is such a bang for the price. The content is amazing and collects all nine books into one. Yes, it is in black and white, which I actually prefer over the color and is the original. The only downside to this book is that the pages are thin and you can see a little bit of the content on the next page, but it is not that noticeable. At about $21, I doubt you can find a better deal on a book of such great quality."
5,THOROUGH - CLEAR - PROFOUND,This tome offers true insight into the mystery of the wound and lucidly points to the relationship between self-healing and spiritual advancement. Bravo.
2,Surprise,"This book was not written by Janet Reno the Attorney General, its another JReno who resides in D.C. Don't order this book if you are expecting to read about the thoughts of our head of Justice."
3,Its OK I Guess,"I just wanted to stop in and say that if you have an everday DVD home theatre system, this DVD will NOT play on it. The system you use will need to be using DVix or there will be NO picture or sound and it will just come up with a error command. You will be needing to play this on your laptop.Cheers and rock onDave"
4,Good reference book,This book gives a good explanation of what depression is as well as effective ways of coping with it. It also provides valuable information and resources.
2,Lots of Problems,"This book should have been a classic introduction to musical acoustics. Instead, it tries to hard, is convoluted, often in error, and confuses musicians.When I taught from this book, I and the class found errors in equations, references to equations, and calculations. When undergraduates are struggling to learn, this is a very bad context.The book is so concerned with a level of comprehensiveness, that measured clarity is left out. At the same time, for the expert, it is too little. Therefore, it appeals to neither the introductory level nor the more advanced level.I gave up using this book."
5,crazy,if you ever heard the beastie boys song the science of sound i got this to learn the lyrics and now i know physics
2,Boring,I bought this book for class. It was required and extremely boring and uncomprehensive. The authors are probably music majors or teachers because they expect you to already know musical terms. Very hard to understand for non-music majors. Also the exercises in the book do not have answers or explanations.
4,Great book!,"I happened to quite like this bood, mostly because of the Willow and Angel interactment. As I happen to be one of the hundreds of W/A shippers out there I enjoyed this book because it had by far the most W/A interaction of all the books.The bad?Too much Buffy/Angel sappyness.Suggestions?An alternate series of books around the W/A relationship!...Just an idea!"
5,Wow......,"This, out of all the Buffy books, was my all-time favorite. Although, it never answered one question for me. How did Angel get out of hell from the second season finale ""Becoming""? But the scenes with Xander and Cordy were actually amusing and somewhat comical. I also liked the moments shared between Buffy and Angel. It was even great to explore into the Chinese and Japanese lore too. I'm really interested in history as a whole and it was neat to read about something concerning it in a book, that dealt with my favorite tv show."
5,one of hte best,"this book has to be one of the best buffy books in the series. it shows not only love , but if you make yourself feel worthless, people or things can take over you. the parts between xander, willow, and buffy will keep you on the edge of your seat. also the twists and turns will keep you reading until the book is over!"
4,READ THIS BOOK,"This was the very first Buffy book I read, but there have been many more since than. This book had a great story, full of suspence and all the typical Buffy humor/banter. The only thing that slowed it down slightly was all the Chineese/japaneese myth and folklore, whice I found a bit booring at times. But other than that the book was great... A MUST read for Buffy fans..."
1,A real crock of you know what!,"We have been in the lifestyle for 5 years. We have never been so insulted as we are by this book. Our expeirience has been a very positive one. We have formed very deep and caring relationships with our friends who share our lifestyle. We confide and trust in one another. I think the authors need to re-evaluate thier lives, because they have missed the boat on this one!"
1,"Sad, really....","I was so excited upon purchasing this DVD...It was my first Myrna Loy movie and I was thrilled...until I put the DVD in.I couldnt bare to watch it for a full five minutes because of the poor quality of film and muffed up sound. I can only hope that polishing this movie up is in the future...it is a classic.Until then, sadly, it sits in my DVD collection...unseen."
1,Works for a little while,"Unfortunately, this made us aim in a really weird way to change the channel for our flatscreen tv. Then it stopped working at all. I thought itd be just an amazing 'universal' remote that'd work universally! But it did not :("
1,Cheaper does`nt mean better.,"This is a cheap crappy product,don`t waste your money.It will drain your tank while your not shooting,from its numerous leaks!No installation instructions for first time users!Not even a simple 1-3 Q/A troubleshooting guide.If I had known that the hose was made from cheap rubber with PLASTIC connecting ends I would`nt of bothered."
4,"incredible walt, not so incredible smell","i really enjoyed reading walt disney, but the copy i got through amazon from another seller smelled so strongly of cigarette smoke i had to get another copy from the library to finish reading it. a very factual book, not biased sounding, just truthful. and it looks like amazon could use a non-smoking section."
5,This is some of the best fantasy I have read.,"I have been reading works of fantasy for a long time now, and this book ranks among the best. It is simply amazing. The character of Nightfall is intricate and believable. The situation into which this character is placed is fascinating, and it brings out all of the elements of his character. In short, the whole book's plot elements and character development is unmatched. More importantly, though, there is something undefinable about this book that is absolutely entrancing. Something about the way the whole book is written just pulls you in and involves you in a thousand ways at once. When I was done with this book, my skin was literally flushed. I just sat there and stared at the back cover for a few moments. This book is that amazinng. If you are reading this review, like fantasy, and do not buy this book, you are making a serious mistake. This book is that good."
5,Wonderful,This CD provides a delicious selection of Hungarian Rom violin music. You cannot go wrong.
1,Ugly people,Jenny. Savilleis a wonderful artist but the subject matter is dreadful. Had I known more about the book I never would have bought it
5,05 F150 5.4L Triton,Direct replacement... The design and spring is slightly different but fits and works identical to the OEM. Installed 2 months ago and works great no whining at a all.
4,Loved the plot!,The plot of this story was amazing and for that reason I just couldn't put this book down. As usual it was riddled with misunderstandings... the huge one being her status as a lady...Also many surprises were included just when you would least expect them. One in particular was very heartwarming and wonderful to read. Brigitte was a true lady and full of strength... she was a perfect match to Rowland who struggled throughout the novel with his feelings for her and confusion over who she really was.Another thing I loved was the constant action. Never a boring moment and you could just feel how the characters felt as they fell in love. The way Brigette tenderly cared for him and accepted his faults was so sweet. And he tried so hard to be gentle with her even though he had never known kindess himself.It's an awesome read. Just what you would expect from Johanna Lindsey.
1,An insult to the bereaved.,"It is obvious Gary Leon Hill is a writer of fiction. Dramatic writing for the stage does not transfer well to the page. I was not so much 'Shocked and Intrigued'as 'Shocked and Disgusted'at his portrayal of victims of suicide as having done so because a 'spirit' has taken them over and made them do it. According to G.L.H. drug/drink addicts are 'asking for it' and Psychiatric hospitals are full of the possessed.Is this Victorian attidudes or Creative writing? The latter, I think.Stick to writing plays, Mr. Hill, and don't insult my intelligence or the memory of many a poor soul who took their life due to whatever unfortunate circumstances they found themselves in."
4,Well Worth Seeing,"At bargain basement price, you will love this collection of Bob Hope movies. These ten DVD movies has been digitally remastered. They're not the former Brentwood VHS versions that were basically unwatchable. However, you will find that some of the movies have minor flaws, but doesn't affect the watchability of them. Please note that the movies are recorded on double-sided media and stacked two on top of each other in a single storage case. So, you'll have to be careful removing the DVD from case to keep from scratching them."
3,"Good features, poor quality","I just bought the phone and it was my first GHz range phone. I'm sorry to say the it sounded like you were talking in a tin can. I didn't like the quality of the sound. The features were nice, but if you can't hear the other person, it really doesn'y matter. Anyway, unless you live in a mansion, don't pay the extra money to get a GHz range phone. Stick with the 900 MHz."
2,DO NOT BUY,"I just bought this phone and I'm on my way to return it. It's ok if you like static. This was my first and last purchase of a V-tech phone. The answering machine had alot of static when someone left a message, and when I'd talk to someone there was also alot of static and it sounded like they were in a tunnel. I ended up buying a GE 900mghz phone for [money amount]and it works GREAT!"
1,bad quality,"This is the second one that I have purchased and both cracked in the oven. The are not suited for baking, and there should be a disclaimer to this effect."
5,This movie has a terrific plot and a really good story.,"The story is set during the settling of the wild west. A young boy sees a young girl singing at the settlers campfire, then never sees her again until they're both grown. Only he doesn't know it's the same girl and she already has her hands full of suitors."
2,"Interesting story, but a bit jumbled","I think I would have liked it more if the story was more focused on St. George, rather than making him into someone, then jumping around with analogies."
4,Very Original and Interesting,"Zoe Keating's musical stylings are original and very nice to listen to. Although it seems like the genre could possibly be too repetitive, each track manages to stand on its own."
4,Sehr gut,"Fun cd with an almost big-band sound. The lyrics are light, clever, and very funny in most cases, particularly Rinderwahn and Kein Schwein ruft mich an. On the other hand, tracks like Lass uns von Lieber sprechen are a little more serious. Max Raabe has good clear diction on most tracks, so following along is easy, even if German is not your first language."
5,TRAPT - some of their biggest songs & nice T,Liked this group for a while. Have several CD's & bought this primarily for the T.Black T with Red TRAPT.
1,It doesn't even make a good doorstop!,I have worked with Laplink 95/3.1 and had a very good experience. So when upgrading my computer and operating program this was a natural to select for file transfer to the new computer. I spent many frustrating hours attempting to make it work. Requests to the on line help generated a reference to an on line article that was of no help. I have given up. This software would not recognize a connection with the provided cable between a Windows 98 Pentium II to a XP Home Edition Pentium IV.
4,Good buy,"This was a winner for a Christmas present. It is long... and tall, a full 8 feet high, so make sure you have room for it. It seems sturdy after 4 months of use. Sturdiness seems to be a concern with these games, and so far, we're happy with this. One of the nets tore, and Spalding's 800 number has a long wait time for customer service, so that was a pain to get replaced, but I was able to do that. Other than that, no problems, and fun!"
2,Broken Scoring Arm :(,"It was fun, for about an hour.....then one of the arms under the goal stopped registering the score. It appears to have a short of shorts in the arm. Only one side now works. I will have to attempt to contact Spalding on Tuesday (holiday) and see what I can do to get that arm replaced."
4,Excellent car cushion,"Since my car seat does not have height adjustment, I bought this cushion to elevate my ischiums. It works fine for me. The reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I would like a way to attach it to the seat, to save me the trouble of putting it into place every time I get in the car."
3,1-Year Replacement Plan for Electronics Products up to $24.99,"Received paperwork, have not had to use yet. Hopefully, because I bought this I won't have too. So far, so good."
3,The Polar Express/Happy Feet/A Christmas Story,"The men/boys in our family like A Christmas Story; me, not so muchThe Polar Express is so soHappy Feet - fell asleep; did not see much of it."
3,Good but awkward pockets,"I like this case, it works well and it looks well made. The only problem with it is that there is no room for a charger. Other than that, great case."
3,Good ultra light duty bag.,"Overall a good quality bag, but offers little protection and little storage room.Pros:Low PriceLight weightGood fit for macbook 13""Cons:Very light protection from impactsLittle storage room (even for power adapters)Summary:The case is a good high quality fit and finish, that is light weight and fits well (macbook 13""), but offers very little impact protection and storage room. If you don't travel with it much, it should serve well, but I would never use this for a travel case."
4,I like it,"I have little experience with kneeboards, but I like this one just fine. The quality of construction is good, the padding is substantial and the strap is beefy and durable. I found the hook on the nose to be *great* for getting up in deep water. I hadn't ridden a kneeboard for years, but I was able to get up on my 2nd attempt and every attempt thereafter. The fins seem to work well and really help dig in on the turns.My only complaint is that the edge, around the perimeter of the board, was a little rough in places when I got it. It was rough enough that I was afraid I might cut myself while carrying it. It only took about 15 min. with a 3m Scotch-brite pad (green) to smooth it out; it is no longer a problem. I dropped the rating from 5 to 4 stars for this finish issue. I wouldn't be discouraged from buying this product because of the issue -- it was easy enough to fix."
5,"What, what?? Dis be some funny....","I've never seen Cho before so I had no expectations. I can only tell you that I've never laughed at my television so much in my life. She's brilliant, dark, intelligent, and disturbed. I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews and can only attribute it to high expectations based on her other shows. Which is good news for me considering this blew my undies off. Cho is awesome if your sense of humor and tilt on life is a little off--watch and enjoy."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Unless you like the same sadistic scene replayed over and over, give this one a pass. If you've read any of Manton's other books, you'll recognize the scenarios played out here--women's rear ends abused in various ways. Unfortunately, this is much more repetitive than some of his earlier works. It also lacks the ""woman as willing participant"" angle that makes other books in the genre far more enjoyable."
4,Good little monitor,"I recently purchased this monitor because the fisher price monitor I owned no longer worked, I have very pleased with it. It's very light weight, good range and clear. I also like the walkie-talkie feature. The only thing annoying about this monitor is the obnoxously long cords and the cord shortener is a pain in the butt."
1,Not worth the money!,I bought this monitor for the two way option and as soon as I plugged it in it had so much static and a beeping noise the kept waking up my newborn. I was very disappointed in this monitor and will tell everyone who asks me. So not worth the 49.99 I paid to toys r us for it.
1,Stinks,"This monitor is the pits. It had constant feedback into the baby's room and also could hear the phone conversation on it! Had Fisher Price Sound N Lights monitor which broke after 2 years, but I went back and bought another one of those which is so much better."
1,Ditto,I'm only writing in to confirm the piece of s#!^ this monitor is. I'm demanding my money back. All I wanted was a good 2-way monitor. I give it 1 star because I have to.
1,"Lund 25505 Not worth $25.00, Poor fit S10","This cowl hit on the top of the windshield wiper bolt, hit the end of the passenger windshield wiper, and blocked your vision going over a steep hill. This appears to be a one size fits all, certainly not an S10. I had to trim out to clear the drivers side hinge, and the hood hit it when raised enough to use the prop rod. There wasn't any good places to screw it down, as there were no places where it would be flat on the cowl opening. About all it is good for is sticking it on when out cruising and taking it off for going offroad, checking oil, or driving where there are steep hills."
2,"Didn""t fit","I was looking forward to putting this on my truck, but after much studying and some xtra help i broke down and called lund only to find out this part will not fit my truck,i sent it back and recieved a full refund,,,sorry it didn't work out"
3,"Picture is great, but buzzes loudly.","Bought this set for my father. The picture quality is excellent, and even has video options for when you have a bad signal (it kind of smooths it out). The colors are bright, text on-screen is crisp and straight (no slanting). But, the bottom line is that the thing buzzes constantly. It's extremely annoying. You can't hear it if you turn the TV way up, but my father often listens to it at night when he has the volume down low, and the buzzing sounds really loud if there are no other sounds around. Maybe it has something to do with being a flat screen, as I've heard there have been problems with flat screens and buzzing. Don't know. But, if buzzing sounds will bother you when trying to watch TV or a DVD, skip this sucker."
3,Not the best Stride Rite shoe,"We only purchase Stride Rite shoes due to our son having very wide feet, and generally love them. These ones make his feet smell, and I notice a different pair that looks very very similar (Harper Fisherman) does not.I looked at them closely and believe it's because the insole on this one is some type of material while the Harper insole is leather.They also gave him blisters on both feet and we have been having him wear socks with them to help heal the blisters.Overall, a decent shoe, but has some flaws."
3,mis-sized?,They seemed like nice sandals but the sizing was not accurate. We ordered 5 wides and they were smaller and narrower than a size 4 regular sandal we had
2,For the Green with the Green only,"If you are unfamiliar with student loans and are not finance savvy then this book will help you. If you already have a student loan and know your way around this book doesn't have anything to offer. In one section it teaches you how to create a budget. That's fine for a kid fresh out of school but I am having trouble with an old student loan and this book had even LESS information than the student loan website !!!Here is good advice... if your having trouble with your loan - call them they will help you, but dont waste the money for this book."
1,Disappointing effort from PBS,"Other episodes of this series actually include scholars on both sides of an interpretation, but this one lets the totally unsuportable ergot theory go unchallenged. No serious scholar of Salem takes the ergot poisoning theory seriously, and I was VERY disappointed to see PBS, an otherwise generally reputable source of documentaries, endorse this urban myth. Caporael's theory was refuted soundly and completely by Spanos & Gottlieb after its initial publication in Science magazine, in the same magazine only a few months later. Shame on you, PBS."
1,"As stated by others, horribly inaccurate!",Yeah....I wondered what was up with my fish dying for no reason. I then read the reviews on what I was relying on to keep my tank at 81 degreess for Discus..this crappy digital thermometer. I bought a real mercury on and the digital one was (and still is) off by more than 4 degrees! I was basically frying my fish that didnt like high temps....nice job CRAPALIFE! Thanks for putting out a product that sucks! DONT BUY THIS!
3,Dry vs. wet,I purchased this product for an emergency incubating an abandoned duck egg. It is terrible! I had two sleepless nights listening to the readings until I switched it out with my aquarium thermometer. It works great in the tank...and I am relieved to say my duckling made it through the fluctuations.
3,2 degrees off,"I bought this for accuracy but it isn't really. I went online and found a ton of blogs where people were going off on this thermometer. Basically everyone was saying how it was always showing a cooler temp than the tank actually was. Everyone was ""cooking"" their fish and or plants because they kept turning up their heaters to compensate. Be careful. I bought four different mercury thermometers to test this out. They all read warmer temperatures than the digital one was showing.All the blogs I found started from around 3 to 4 years ago to present. I guess the company hasn't quite got the quality control corrected yet. Some people's digital thermometers were way more off than mine. Some people said they bought several more and kept getting incorrect readings.Mine always showed 2 degrees cooler than was the actual temperature. Be careful. Be warned."
1,Crap,"For whatever reason, this thermometer isn't accurate and now it is even less accurate. It is 4 degrees cooler than the real temp. Not sure why."
1,Does not work.,It has one button to turn it on that does not work. I have to mess with it for a few minutes pressing the button about 100x to get it to stay on. It's a new battery so it must be a faulty device. I'm sending it back.
3,short useful life,"Bought 2. Worked well for a few years, then both became widely erratic (off by over 10 F). Suction cup never worked. So, if you don't mind replacing it every few years, it may suit you, otherwise try something else."
1,Wouldn't recommend this company!!!,I order from this company and it said free shipping however I had to pay the post office $6.36 to receive the package. When I opened the box it was not shipped properly and leaked all over the place. I sent Super Nail an email to try to reconcile this and never heard back for them!! Very disappointed!!!
1,Very Unsafe! Do Not Buy!!!!!!,"The straps on this car seat keep coming loose while I am driving!!! I thought it was something that I was doing wrong at first but now I know it is not. This is suppose to be one of the safest baby products that you buy and yet it is the most unsafe!!! I am so dissapointed that a big name company like Eddie Bauer could sell such a useless piece of equipment. (Not as important, but the wheels also squeak. Very annoying, but not dangerous)."
1,"This camera is amazing, until it stops working.","I purchased this camera on sale at Target. The camera exceeded my expectations.However, only a month after use, the camera would only take pictures in landscape mode. All other modes freeze after a picture is taking.I recommend purchasing a different camera."
3,Not enough Memory,"I like the camera, it works nicely, does what I want it to. The only thing is it only holds 6 pictures w/out a seperate memory chip. :("
4,I wish it had a charger,"I bought this because a few weeks ago a friend of mine had this exact same camera. I waited until this weekend to buy it....even though it came with double a batteries, I think I should've been warned about how fast it would drain out. Even though I didn't do alot with it, the batteries still ran out in 1 day. Overall I love it! First digital camera I've own.~V~"
3,Wish the sound was of better quality,"Since there is very little legitimate Prince footage availible, anything we fans can get is very valuable. This was a great concert and we are lucky to have it on tape. But in comparison to ""Sigh of the Times"", the sound quality was disappointing. Maybe if this concert is ever transferred to DVD the sound will be upgraded and improved."
5,Just a little spelling correction,"It's Balzac's La Comédie Humaine (& not Humane). It would be nice if you could correct this in your listing. Otherwise, what can be said is that Balzac is to French novels what Shakespeare is to British plays, i.e. an author capable of writing masterpiece after masterpiece."
3,Overly Wordy.,"It is a descent book, has a lot of problems to choose from which would be great for a professor. However, it is far to wordy in so much of the material. Not to mention, it lacks heavily on the mathematics, and does not have examples (unless very on the rare occasion).Professors, I do not know the options out there, but this books is far to wordy and takes far to long to get to the point it needs to make. It makes it more difficult from a student's perspective to balance their time efficiently enough to contain all the information this book gives. It fairly often has weighted sentences that are not always directly appropriate for learning the material in one semester."
1,The worst textbook i've ever used,"Of all the textbooks i have ever used at university (and as a fourth year student there have been quite a lot) this is simply the worst by far. Unlike the other physics textbooks i have used which were good at clarifying material, i found myself more confused after reading this book. Material i understood perfectly well at the lecture become suddenly incomprehendable when reading this awful book. Avoid it.Having shelled out money at the beginning of the semester for this book, i ended up using other optics books from the library all semester. Do NOT buy this book."
5,Finally a compact versatile device:,"Finally someone has designed a compact device to attach to my cell phone. I bought the dash mount for my and my wife's car. Available is a clip that I have attached to my briefcase (you can use it on a backpack).I had a bulky plastic holster that always seemed to be in the way, now this tiny precision made accessory is available.The rivet attaches to the back of your cell phone; camera, i-pod or whatever, it slides into the v-clip and voila.I love this product and recommend it to all my friends and co-workers."
1,"Great Subject, Lousy Book","This book utterly failed to meet any of the expectations I had for it. The biggest and most obvious problem is that Smith adopted a writing style that is painful to read. It's like Ring Lardner or Red Smith after taking a foul ball to the head. It tries way, WAY too hard, and comes off as gimmicky.Smith also likes to use quotes for no particular purpose related to baseball history. A quote by Jackie Gleason about how he drank to get bagged leads into a note that fans went out to celebrate when the Philly Atlantics snapped the Reds 79 game winning streak. The quote is longer than the actual baseball-related text!I almost never put down a book before finishing. This was one of those times, 63 of the most painful pages I've read in some time into the book. Avoid at all costs."
2,Anyone remember an amphicar?,"An amphicar was that vehicle from the early 60's that was a combination of car and boat. It didn't last long, cause it was neither a very good car nor a very good boat.The author did the same thing here, he tried to combine a baseball history book, and a book about baseball stadiums. I don't think it worked. He skimmed details about baseball history, and he skimmed details about basbeall stadiums. If you like the detail like I do, there are better books available that deal with each subject individually.Also, his writing style can best be described as ""staccato"", or kind of choppy. It was difficult to read.Again, if you like detail instead of overview, this book is not for you."
3,"a good solution for headset echo, but iffy connections","do people constantly tell you that they hear an echo when you're talking to them on your bluetooth headset? that's because the mike is about an each from the speaker. i had given up on finding an affordable headset without this echo problem until i found this one. the quality of the individual components of the headset - earpiece, mike - aren't fantastic, but it's easy to put the clip on mike wherever it's comfy, and keep it far enough away from the earpiece to avoid the echo. too many unexplained dropped bluetooth connections for my liking, but overall a good headset for the price. i use it much more than any other i've had"
2,This book needed a better Proof Reader!,"If you are an experienced programmer, you might be able to follow what this book purports to teach you. The problem is that many, many of the examples and the text itself contain errors. For instance, Program listing 9.2 indicates that the scripting language is Livescript, not Javascript. Whoops! Figure 2.6 does NOT show the output of program ""quote.htm"". Table 2.5 repeats itself for some reason on the subsequent page. The TIP example on page 77 is incorrect. The ELSE part of the IF THEN ELSE statement explanation on page 81 is incorrect. Figure 3.3 on page 93 should really be associated with figure 3.4 on page 102, but is not. Some of the programs included on the CD ROM are not identical to the programs listed in the textbook... I could go on, but this only makes sense if you buy the book and make the errata corrections. If I were you, I would wait for the revised edition if you really want to learn Javascript without being totally confused or annoyed"
2,unhappy,Buyer beware. Most of these are poor remakes. His voice is not nearly as good as when he did the originals.
3,"Neil, you can't sing your music anymore...","I have been a life long fan of Neil Diamond. The man has helped me through many a hard time in my life, but I must say that the ""Essentials"" CD disappoints me tremendously regarding his live cuts. He has certainly lost his voice...too many cigarettes I fear. His ballads are timeless and I will always enjoy them. It has been several years since I've seen him live and it was quite a shock to hear his broken voice on this CD. Neil, I will ALWAYS love your music, but it might be time to start thinking about retiring from your live performances. :-(The only reason I am giving this CD a rating of 3 is because I just can't bring myself to rate any of his material lower than that, although I should with this CD...I just can't. Forgive me Neil!"
1,"Sex, Drugs, Rock N Roll get old","this album is just too hardcore for me, with thrashing guitars and banging drums, i got a headache, maybe i have a tumor! but this cd sucks. Metal at its worst"
2,Crapshoot,Like another reviewer i find the live tracks are absolute crap. The distortion is horrible. Very noticeableclipping. Tragic and sad. Probably really bad originals.
4,Works like a charm,My 4 year old daughter complained that the chin rest hurt. No problems once the Kinder Chinder was installed. She uses it with her Kun shoulder rest.
1,Pass It Up...,"Backyard Bird Newsletter (BBN) is the companion piece to the excellent Bird Watchers Digest (BWD) that I have subscribed too for years. It is offered every other month that BWD isn't published. I picked up a subscription to it my first year with BWD for I thought it would be nice to receive something every month. Unfortunately unlike BWD which is an excellent publication for birders of all interests and levels, (see my review of it at the link) I cannot recommend the companion newsletter. Its a very thin, (about 8 to 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that carries as many ads in it as helpful and interesting articles. I never spent more than 10 minutes thumbing through it before tossing it out each month. I let my subscription to it lapse after the first year. It is definitely not worth $16 for six issues to be sure. Subscribe to BWD and sign up for their free email newsletter that is loaded with helpful hints and article highlights. And forget this option.Bird Watchers Digest"
2,Not worth it,"I'm young and my vision isn't too bad, but the book is a mini-book, and the font is about a 4 point. I regret not reading the reviews of this book before I bought it, so buyer beware!"
2,"The branch will not break, poems by James Wright","I must say, this book was so very tiny, I thought it was a joke. Don't get me wrong, it is very cute and adorable but at 3 1/4 inches long, it makes for a better conversation piece than reading matteral! I've always been told you can't judge a book by it's cover, so I guess I'll give it a try...okay, so I'm trying to give it a try, but the print is so little, it's giving me a head ache! I'm just glad I'm not a little 'ole lady with bad eye sight, I would never be able to read it! How many of this teeny tiny books are out there? Bye for now, I'm gonna go see if I can find the 'teeny tiny woman' so she will have something to put in her teeny tiny cabnet. Have a nice day."
2,No thank you,"long, boring, and depressing. The Rough Riders was a bit of a stretch. It made Teddy Roosevelt look like a bumbling school boy."
4,Two in One Book,This book is a great book for kids to learn their ABC's and to begin art appreciation. Each letter has different pictures to go with it representing a word that starts with the letter of the the alphabet. There is a wide varitey of pictures in the book. Great book for young kids.
2,"Great idea, but...",The implementation lacks something to be desired. Maybe a version 2 will be better.
1,Bag too small for yoga mat and poor customer service,"Tried to stuff two different yoga mats into this bag and neither would fit without major issues. Returned the bag but customer service is non-responsive and despite proof that the bag was delivered to their location weeks ago, have not yet received a refund."
3,May wish to look for a product with better support,It is not so much a problem with the program as it is with the support. If you don't understand their limited instructions on how to get a component of the product to work then you are in for a real treat. You can only contact support via email. The person on the other end is probably reading hundreds of emails a day and answering them. Your problem is given a quick look and then a short answer or sometimes a question is sent back to you. Support may have misread your question or just not have read it completely and their response is so limited that you have to email them again to try to get more information. You get into an endless loop. I am going on now for 1 week trying to get one problem solved. You may wish to pass this one up unless you have been doing web design for a while.
2,GN Netcom Phone Lifter,"I've already replaced this item once. I love the headset but the lifter is weird. My second unit failed today ... just like the first one did: it just quit working. So I started to do research on Google related to problems with it. I also remembered seeing reviews on Amazon prior to our original purchase so I came back and read the three that were already attached to this procuct. I was amazed at the July 2007 review that said GN Netcom tech support said to tap the unit on the side. I did and it worked! Needless to say, I laughed right out loud! Evidently a sensor inside the unit is poorly engineered so that every once in awhile it hits a dead spot. A little ""bang"" on the unit either wakes up the unit or gets the sensor off its dead spot. Go figure. This item has been around for awhile too, so I'm surprised it hasn't been reengineered. Sounds like an insert should be put with the operating instructions saying, ""If unit stops working, bang it on its side."""
1,Don't Buy This Item!,"I've been searching for authentic Perry Ellis shower gel for about a year now - I think the brand is discontinued as far as gels and lotions. I love and can still find the perfume but I like the less distinctive smell of a shower gel or lotion. I bought this hoping I had found a hidden stash. Unfortunately, this product is packaged in the 360 bottle but it doesn't smell like it at all. Instead, it smells and lathers like shampoo - not what I had in mind for my body. Pass this one up if you are looking for a true Perry Ellis 360 shower gel."
2,Tiny,"Keep in mind, this thermometer is is quite small and as such is not easy to read. If the size is acceptable to you, you will be pleased with the solid brass appearance."
2,Not what I wanted,"This item turned out to be much smaller than I thought it would be; therefore I had to return it. It was an attractive item, just not right for my purpose."
1,no good,Too small and not accurate. I bought these to see if we could regulate the temp. on our office. Everyone agreed it was a bust! Would not suggest anyone buy these if they wanted more than a conversation piece.
3,Good pictures but unoriginal,"I have all the books Mr Kaplan has done in this format and (sort of) series. I thought ""One Last Look"", ""Their Finest Hour"" (now out in paper as ""The Few""), ""Little Friends"", and ""Round the Clock"" were all excellent. Great writing, attractive visually, good sidebars, thoroughly enjoyable. This one is good but, if you have the others, you will find much you have seen before. Some of the quoted passges and many of the photographs are duplicated here. My advice is: if you do have the others, pass on this; if not, go ahead."
3,"Useful, but internet has same info for free","I bought this book and expected to use it a lot. I have since realized that when my kids don't feel well, I turn to the web, not a book. It's a lovely, book, but really not needed."
3,It was a cute book,I read Until Now first and then discovered that that the events in this book took place first. Terry really was completely unlovable in both books. But they makes a cute series anyway.
2,Arrgh!!! Wish I was six feet under for much of season 5,"Can this thing drag out ANY longer than it did? For a show whose pilot episode was the best episode of the entire series, man these final seaons 4 and 5 dragged. I would have to give it just a 1-star but there is PARTIAl REDEMPTION because the finale was unique and actually uplifting. I realize it might be difficult to make a funeral home show uplifting, it was not just depressing in a more normal funeral home kind of way... it was depressing in a boring, milking-this-thing-too-long way."
3,stinky mouth,"My dog's mouth still smells but that is because an infection so I can't tell if this product works or not. but I guess if you brush your pet's teeth it would just be better and enough.El ocico de mi perro aun huele, pero eso es por una infeccion en las encias. No puedo decir si este producto funciona o no, pero yo creo que con una buena higiende dental no tendras problemas."
5,THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK - SO COMFORTING,"This beautiful book is so inspiring and so comforting. If one feels lonely or stressed, or experiences some loss of faith, this book will totally revive you and bring you closer to Our Lord and His dear Mother. Miracles happen every day and yet so many of us fail to recognize them. This book will help you to realize that you are never alone, that with prayer and faith, many wonderful gifts are bestowed on us. Some gifts we may not even recognize and others will be quite evident. It's beautifully written with a message to all just full of love and inspiration. I have read through it many times and find myself going back to it often during times of distress."
5,A TRUE BLESSING,"The stories rekindled my faith on praying the Rosary, it is foremost on my mind that prayer is truly the staircase to Heaven."
1,He returned it after using it a few times.,Couldn't get a close shave without going over the same area 10 times or more. Very disappointed after the adds on TV made it look ao good.
3,"Nice shaver, but ...","This was the perfect razor for me -- gives great shave. However, it is cheaply made. After about 2 weeks of use, the button that allows you to clean the shaver broke while I was trying to remove the shaver head. I think that I will try the Remington titanium. Hopefully, it is of better design."
3,titanium turbo razor,"Excellent shave with one day growth, but hit and miss with longer growth. Caution in cleaning as the head is not solidly affixed to the base. Cleaning requires the head to be supported between your thumb and index finger as you brush the the cutting head."
4,revalations,"interesting take on christianity. Gnostic ideas give me a double-take back from some of my skeptical opinions. not an in-depth volume, but a good primer."
1,Remember The Producers?,"Remember the shot in The Producers, where we get the audience reaction to Springtime for Hitler? Eyes popping, mouths agape. There's a punchline in The Producers. Alas, there is no punchline here.What is so chilling is that not only does pathological tripe like this exist but that there is an audience for it. Read the incoherent, semi-literate diatribe in the product description. Read the five-star reviews. We fought a world war, sacrificing blood and treasure, to rid the world of creatures like this, and yet -- as if America were a roach-infested house -- they just keep crawling back."
1,Disapointment,"I give this one star because I can't choose any lower. I was expecting a documentary with facts but what I got was accusations and photo-shopped pictures. A complete waste of time and money. The man that created this has a racist, Anti-semantic problem. He raves on and on in an irritating voice without saying anything of any value. At the end, you know that he hates Obama, black people and Jews."
1,A Great Read!!,"With two such gifted authors, this book couldn't help but be great. It lived up to all my expectations, with unforgettable characters and a well paced story. The dragons were intriguing, not being the usual ""bad"" kind. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to read something that they will long remember.Not sure why this is showing I only gave 1 star...it should be 4 stars at least."
4,A wonderous trip into the mind of a legend,"This book is one of the better books I have read in this genre, which is to be expected from the minds of Norton and Lackey.They take the reader into the life of Shauna, a half-human, half-elven woman whose power exceeds that of both races she is from.This book delves into the fulfilment of a legend and a prophecy. The story is shown from shauna's point of view, and the authorsdo an excellent job of showing us the workings of her mind. This is definately a book that I would reccomend to anyone who likesfantasy, or to anyone who wishes to start reading fantasy."
1,Sight unseen,"Not quite sure what you mean. I have never seen this item,therefore I can not honestly rate it."
4,"Useful, but needs a finer publisher","This book and its companion piece on the Roman republican era are enormously useful for a person like me who went to the Eternal City with very specific sightseeing goals. Both are like conversations with someone who's been there and knows the shortcuts to the history and how to get to the locations. Easy to carry around and gets to the point immediately. The one detraction is that the publishing is a bit of a home job and pictures are missing, smeared, or otherwise not terribly useful. But these books, plus a standard Lost Planet Guide To Rome, are really all you need to get around and really capture the essence of both the obvious must-sees and the more obscure sights that you'll be glad you took the time to investigate."
2,Not a replacement for my previous brand.,"Mostly I have used KAL pure stevia, but have also purchased some from a health food store called Sweetleaf Stevia by Wisdom Nature Brands. They were comparable.This stuff is not a replacement. It takes much more to make a noticible taste change, and I'd say it results in more bitterness.I am also not pleased with maltodextrin being used as a filler. This is basically a modified starch. Maybe so modified as to become a polysaccharide sugar. It is not something I want to add to my food, even a 1/4 teaspoon a dose.Basically this product is useless to me."
2,Too Bad!,"This Box Set is well packaged ,includes three seperate discs, it's too bad though that Madacy describes this as a Collectors Edition.It is not Widescreen, nor does it have any other extras worth mentioning,picture quality is extremely poor. The cover looks good even though the picture cover is a still from another Lee Van Cleef film altogether,(The Good,The Bad and The Ugly)Advise,only buy this if you can't get the titles elsewhere.Boxset is 4:3 pan& scan. Quality, appears to be copied from videoFilms included: Death Rides A Horse , God's Gun andKid Vengeance."
1,Too Scary Kitty,"I wish I had seen all of the reviews for this, before I purchased this video from Toys R' Us. This is the first video purchase I have been disappointed in buying. The other reviewer who noted the scary witch scene was right -- the witch sharpening the knife sequence was too scary!!! My daughter is still talking about how scary it was days later. While the other shorts on here were fine - the third one implied way too much violence for the age group that might normally purchase this -- I would not endorse this video for kids under six and/or kids who have not watched a lot of violence/scary scenes. The implied violence just seemed too inappropriate given the sweet, pleasant nature of the rest of the video."
2,"Beware, Unauthorized! That is unless you're a Mostly Autumm Fan?","Genesis critisized, mostly this DVD consists of the English prog band kissing up to them, its a little sickening. The Duke era actual Genesis inveriews are neat, but only take up about 10 minutes of the long painful hour shmooze fest."
1,Dissapointing material on the CD's Not as good as I expected it to be.,I did not like this CD collection. I've had other CDs of the Rat Pack Song collections and this one disappointed me.
5,A Prime Example,"Deco-D's ""Prime Example"" is a slept on album! Featuring Andre Nickatina, San Quinn, D-Moe & others. Solid album with good production from Icy Mike Beats, Dion Peete & Eddie Fresh. I was surprised that it goes so cheap online, definately worth swooping up.!"
5,Expand Your View Of God's Greatness,"Through this book, my view of God and His greatness were expanded. Additionally, this book helped me to better understand the role that I play in what God does. I strongly recommend this book."
5,Intelligent,"This book has been attacked by those who disagree with it, but I found it a clear and intelligent argument. Boyd shows the reader how he worked and how he arrived at his conclusions. This is a good, brief read for someone who wants to see a Protestant theologian at work.I teach Theology in college and sometimes recommend it on those grounds."
1,No New Engines!,"Not ONE new engine on this DVD, despite what the 'Thomas and Friends Yearbook' says. There is no episode with Molly, Neville,or Dennis on this whole DVD. There is one, however, with Peter Sam, who cannot be purchased anymore because he is retired. My son is very disappointed."
3,"good, but more directions needed-very hard to lock door","Appears to be very sturdy, but it is not clear how one locks the pen corners so the whole thing does not move. Once the angles move, it becomes very hard to lock the door at the three locking points. Does anyone out there have advice on how to do this??8 metal rods came with the pen, but zero directions on how to use them, and the pdf's available at the GoGo site are no help either. Could these be for locking the pen into shape??Could be a better product with a bit more set up help."
5,A very helpful encyclopedia,This is a very helpful encyclopedia. Birnbaum is highly learned and he writes in a very clear way. I often use this dictionary when I wish to understand a certain Jewish concept in a better way. But anyone interested in deeply understanding these concepts must use other sources as well.
2,Just for Small Batteries,Pros: Small and Light. Small Power comsuption...Cons: Not suitable for cars batts or larger. If able to charge this ones will do it to slowly.
1,Too thin,"Although I didnt get mine here, I went and got this little mute. Big mistake. The slit in the mute is so slim is barely even gets a millimeter of my bridge in. It fell and put a hefty dent into my varnish and wood. I am never again putting it on there. And I don't have a particularly thick bridge. I looked afterward and found that many had the same problem."
4,Great mystery,A who done it and fast read. Really enjoyed trying to guess who it was. I would recommend this books for mystery lovers.
5,I love this book,"It is so nice to hear about an author and find a book by that person, even thought it was published a long time ago!"
2,Lowry Memior,This is a memoir of moments that happened in the author's life that influence her writing process. The book ranged from one paragaph to one page snapshots with pictures to highlight the themes.
1,Rip-off - Does not cover normal wear and tear,"I had to write a review. They're clearly astroturfing their own products as the exact same text is the only review for most of their plans.I bought a replacement plan for some headphones I bought. Short story: even though the product description says they will, they would not cover it because the damage was through normal wear and tear. They said they only extend the manufacturer's warranty and, as it only covers product defects, that's all they would cover."
5,Simply the Best,"These peanut chews have always--and will always--be the best chocolate candy EVER. Better than all of the rest. The chocolate is dark, but not bitter, the molasses and peanuts are absolutely scrumptious. I ordered the box and ate 16 packs in 10 days. I also ordered the big bag; I'm still munching on them and I am NOT giving them to the kids for Halloween."
1,poor quality,"Purchased for my 2011 JK. Stock tires are approx. 29 inches, Bought the 30 inch cover. Fit good, however when i had to remove to check tire pressure on spare, the was already about a one and a half in tear near the elastic band. I'm not one to complain but I probably will not buy another product from BesTop. Which is sad because I will be purchasing a new softtop within the year. Would not recommend. There is cheaper and more expensive covers, wish I had tried either. Name brand means nothing."
2,Did not fit 35x13.50 tire,"It arrived with a split seam. I decided to try it anyway just to confirm it would fit and it did not fit a 35x13.50, so I did not order a replacement. It does not look like it would be easy to install or remove, so just be aware of this if you use your spare regularly (for example, off-roading or construction)."
3,Does the job but not for long,"Not sure if it's the quality of these Snaps or all snaps, but with repeated snapping/unsnapping they break easily. Will look for a different brand next time."
2,"Not good enough, Microsoft!","With so many errors, I wonder if the authors have even bothered to read through the book after writing it.They even change the project and solution names during some of the examples.Maybe that's not a big deal after all, but it's very annoying."
1,Poor Design,I had one of these 20 years ago and it was easy to use and it worked. This one leaked and was a cleanup mess. I still have paint stains on the driveway. I returned it to Amazon.
1,Pain to clean and use,"I found this thing a pain to use and clean. Used it once and tossed it. Ended up buying a nice USA made Graco Sprayer for $300 that was such a pleasure to use and so fast, although clean up with that is a bit of a chore but not as bad as the Wagner roller."
2,Kurt Russell,"I Love Kurt Russell In Movies,he portrayed Elvis pretty Good,but I wouln't watch it again"
3,Puff piece,"If you want a very rosy colored vision of Elvis, then get this movie. This is all the good with very little of the bad tossed in. Kurt Russell does a very good job of portraying Elvis and it is great to see Graceland, but a little more realistic story would have been nice. Col. Parker even comes out looking okay."
1,Schadenfreude - look that up,"If you need to read 282 pages to figure out that rape and incest occur in all societies, you probably don't get out much, and when you do, you probably stop to look at freeway carnage whenever possible, and you might just love this book. Because of reputable recommendations, PEN/Hemingway award, NYT book review raves, and general sheep mentality awards, I kept thinking there might be something redeemable about reading this book, but it must be on page 283. No, in my opinion, a truly talented writer does not use his skills to display some of the basest of human nature and disguise that content as somehow appropriate without also presenting a critical analysis or solution. Don't look for that here. Never have I wasted so much time on so much wasted paper."
1,Crass and Valgur,It seems as Mr. Sharma has only been to India on two occassions he may not have the time or the inclination to research the novel. Apparently the novel is based on his family and Ram Karan is either his grand father or his father. People like Mr. Sharma should be stopped from littering the world with their filthy writing by which they tend to degrade and demean their own country/motherland.
4,"Brilliant But Sad, Disturbing","Sharma initially manages to generate enormous contempt for the main character, but near the end generates pity and simple sadness for his unhappy state. The author writes with clarity and honesty the madness that consumes the main character when he gives in to his selfishness and how he tries desperately to redeem himself."
3,"a challenging, thoughtful read","this material clearly isn't for everyone, but most of those who responded above did not read the book critically. from the illogic of their comments, one suspects jhumpa lahiri's ""interpreter of maladies"" would be too overwhelming for them as well, even though its subject matter is far less disturbing. ""an obedient father"" is a rewarding read for anyone who reads critically, and an exceptional debut that was nominated for some of the most prestigious awards in american literature. give it a try and form your own opinion."
2,Read the Excerpt. Don't Bother with the Book.,"The excerpt in The New Yorker was so disturbing and yet so very compelling that I had to get this book. Unfortunately, that was the best chunk of this first novel by Akhil Sharma. It's not a terrible book, but it's not really all that interesting, either. It also bothered me that the second chapter is told from the point of view of the daughter, and then it's just completely dropped (I expected an alternating narrative). Ram Karan, the main character, is indeed an odious fellow, but that wasn't the reason why I didn't like this book. It's just a plodding, emotionally lukewarm work."
1,major disappointment,"Avoid this book, unless you want to get bored, ragged or irritated. This is plain pretense to provbe to the critics that this is a serious novel about today's issues. The characters are pretty cardboard, the situations unbelievable and the writing style--zilch. I don't know how the book got past the editing staff of publishers. Now was India in turmoil after Rajiv Gandhi's death or after Indira gandhi's death. Sharma is not sure. Well that is his level of knowledge of affairs in India. Maybe he should write something which is more believable next time...."
2,Very Cute But Smelly,"My son loves putting these boots on because they make him laugh. However, they smelled so strongly of the industrial chemicals used in their manufacture, that I refuse to keep them in his room. You would think that manufacturers of kids apparel would be extremely concerned about strong solvent smells."
3,Markers,"Fast delivery...but shipping was expensive and they sent three little packs of markers in a huge box with a ton of packing, when they probably could have just put in in an envelope"
4,Learning from legal history,"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. noted the importance of considering history and experience when understanding the law. In The Common Law (1881), Mr. Holmes noted ""The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience."" And, in a Supreme Court decision (New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349 (1921)), Justice Holmes stated ""Upon this point a page of history is worth a volume of logic."" Professor Langbein's book provides a good illustration of how an examination of legal history can provide important factual context to better understand some of the strengths and weaknesses of the adversary system of criminal justice. Although the book is not for casual reading, it is written in a style that can be understandable for a conscientious reader who is not a lawyer or professional historian. Anyone interested in better understanding of the origins of American criminal trials should consider reading this book."
4,Piecing together Perelman,"I agree that it should be a capital crime to butcher Perelman's published works, but since I can't find an unabridged copy of ""The Most of S. J. Perelman"", this book does well enough. As the only thing removed was ""Acres and Pains"", and that CAN be purchased separately, I would strongly recommend this book."
2,Very poor packaging for a fragile product.,"I have been using compact florescent lamps for three years and have saved hundreds of kilowatt hours, but this particular choice is very bad.When I received the package, 2 of the 3 lamps were shattered, leaving a trail of sharp glass fragments and mercury dust from my front door to my kitchen.The lamps were factory packaged in a flimsy cardboard box, with no markings indicating there was fragile glass inside.I was trying to reduce impact on the environment by using an energy saving device, but instead, poluted my personal environment with broken glass and toxic mercury.Amazon's buyer made a mistake with this product."
5,Were the Greek gods just mythical?,"Two millenia ago and counting Xenophanes observed that people tended to worship dieties culturally similar to themselves.And so, people of India worshiped Indian born deities; people of Egypt worshiped Egyptian deities and Greeks worshiped Greek deities.According to Xenophanes, the process demonstrated the inherently mythical nature of faith.In Veyne's brilliant the point is made that perhaps another view is possible: that truth has a relativistic quality.And also: that perhaps Xenophanes was being unduly dismissive.In other words, we need not endow our myths we mutually exclusive truth. So your truth and my truth can be different but still...well...true.Viewed this way there's a certain political correctness to Veyne's approach. If in creating our cultural deity we recognize the divine in ourselves, maybe after all, that's not such a bad thing."
3,"Better than ""The Holiday,"" but not by much",I watched it with my wife to keep her happy. But the movie lost me when the supposed New England house was landscaped with tropical plants. I thought is was Southern California but found out in the credits it was South Africa.But I do have to say that I 'liked' it better than 'The Holiday' which had a way too similar story line with a different ending.
2,Your average (but well shot and directed) chick flick weepie.,"Tara Road (2005) is your average weepie. But I was interested by how technically sound the film was. The direction was very slick and I felt the cinematography was top notch. The movie itself was your run-of-the-mill chick flick that'll appeal to the thirty to forty something middle class crowd. I thought I take a cjnce and check it out. Two women from across the pond who have never met each other somehow come part of each others lives. Andie MacDowell and Olivia Williams star as the two main characters who touch each others lives. Stephen Rera makes an appearance in a guest starring role. The DVD is a bare bones affair (aside an interview segment with Maeve Binchy (who wrote the novel this film was based upon).If you enjoy beautifully shot weepy dramas, then you'll want to watch this one. It took a couple of years to finally reach the 'States, but Tara Road is now availible on DVD."
4,VG SimpleShare 500,This is an easy to install and setup storage solution. I am not using any of the software that was included but it looks very good. Price and performance rate high marks.
3,"Easy Setup, Great Value",So far I am very pleased with the Simple Share. The setup went smoothly and was up and running within 15 minutes. I am a little concerned about the heat generated by the drive and have set up an external fan connected to the USB which seems to be doing the job. Great value!
2,Worked well until.... drive failed,"I had no difficulty configuring this device to work with my Windows wireless network, and the drive worked for 5 weeks. At that time a hardware failure caused it to cease functioning. Amazon will allow returns for a fraction of the purchase price (I am out of the 30 day window, and have no packaging at this point), and SimpleShare only offers to repair the device.Unfortunately, my sample of one leads me to think I'll have a mean time to failure of 5 weeks (sure, this isn't how this metric is determined, but you can remind me of that after you back up your precious photos on it), so it is effectively useless to me. I don't want it repaired. I want my money back.Don't back up your computer, pictures, or other precious data on this device."
1,Too loud!,"I bought the 400 GB version. Unpacked it. Hooked it up. Heard it. Repacked it. Returned it.I could hear it upstairs, a floor above my dead-quiet mac mini computer."
5,Stirrings of a kindred soul,The corries open a window into the souls of the celtic people. Stirring my kindred spirit with their haunting songs. Bring to mind the fellowship of the ancient folk.
2,Just OK,Plot was interesting but main characters lacked any depth. All in all felt it was rather childishly written - not a book to keep you awake.
3,Audio Book Better than Book,"Reading prior reviews, apparently the audio book is much better than the book. The audio book omitted any reference to a sexual relationship between John & Sarah and didn't give an involved picture of Supereme Court operations, unlike the book. The book was a good fit as an andio book...very suspenseful and a lot of action. The ending explanation of ""whodunit"" was a little unbelieveable and rather convoluted, but that also made the ending a surprise."
4,thought provoking,"I have read several of his books and have not been disappointed in any of them yet and this is no exception. A few years ago I may have thought it was a little far fetched, but I have been reading too many political books lately (trying to figure out what is going on in this country) and find that it is very believable. There are a lot of twists and turns and thrills and suspense, and romance (some have said they could leave it out, but I kinda liked it) to keep you interested.Rufus Harms has been in military prison for 25 years for killing a little girl. He knows he did it but he didn't know why until he receives a letter and then it comes back to him. He gets an appeal sent to the supreme court, but important people find out and anyone who has any knowledge about the case is murdered. Rufus knows he is in trouble and his days are numbered if stays in prison. Buy the book and find out what happens. I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Another trip down the hill,"Let's be honest, Baldacci has been going downhill since the Winner. That book was a disappointment and The Simple Truth was a continuation of his spiral in to the abyss of the cookie cutter, money making rush to turn out something - no matter how poor the product.I could not finish this book. I put it down and returned to it two weeks later and found that it had not improved with time.Please, David, go back to the style that produced Absolute Power and Total Control. Put some thought into your plot, add a few twist and turns and dazzle us again."
1,Too Predictable.,"Let me make a general remark first. Contemporary American writers lack the subtlety of writing a good piece of prose with a strong control over the storyline. They can be labelled as good story-tellers but not good novelists. (No, I'm not British and yes, Stephen King is an exception).Now, this was my first Baldacci and he holds true to my above remark. Very poor character configuration, no scene-settings at all, and above all, a very predictable ending. As for the storyline, well, it was all too bald. My first impression about Baldacci? Another storyteller in wake of so many getting advantage of a huge readership which is not introduced to intricacies of a novel yet."
3,It keeps your interest,"This book will keep your interest, and you'll read through its 511 pages relatively quickly. But the book loses credibility when its characters act unrealisticly. Things happen in this book that just wouldn't happen in real life, and it leaves you shaking your head as you read it. Its a decent book, and I'm glad I read it, but there are better books out there."
2,Disappointing,"The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many. Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attaché case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it.I have read much better books than that. Sorry..."
5,Lots of inside tid bits for Supreme Court enthusiasts!,"This fictional story is fast paced and well organized. Some superb character development along with a good story line. If you are interested in the Sumpreme Court or are a legal genre buff this read is a must! The only disappointment were all the spelling and print errors, did anyone read the galley proofs?"
1,The Simple Truth,"I had to force myself to finish this book. I was able to accomplish this because I did not want to waste my purchase cost. Very slow moving, hard to believe and even harder to care about what happened to the characters."
2,A disappointment,"I really enjoyed Mr. Baldacci's previous books and was excited to read this one. I even recommended it to my book club. Unfortunately I was thoroughly disappointed. There was so much fluff in this book I couldn't stand it. Why does every author feel compelled to include some sort of romantic subplot in their books? I think the idea behind the story was good, although not very original. I am embarrassed to have recommended this book to others."
3,More incoherent rambling.,"From the world's most pretentious author.Great premise ruined by classic Baldacci style, i.e nonsense in overdrive. In the end of this semi-interestingconspiracy about an innocent man who has spent over 20 years in a military prison for a murder he did not commit,it all comes together like motor oil in your Spanish omelet when we find that the co-conspirators are allcitizens of great prestige who yet 25 years later all live in the same hamlet and include the mayor, the sheriff,the base commander, the coroner, the district attorney, the dogcatcher, and the Good Humor man. Its ridiculous.You've been warned. 3 Stripes, and only cause I liked Rufus."
5,Riveting,The only way I could stop reading this book to go to sleep was to have someone else turn the light off. Read it.
5,Is The Truth Ever Simple,"An excellent, complex, interwoven story with themes and characters causing strong emotional reactions.John Fiske, an ex-cop turned defense attorney begins to investigate his younger brother Michael's murder and unravels an injustice that occured 25 years earlier in an Army prison. Michael, a clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court sought answers to an appeal by Rufus Harms, a huge Afro- American soldier imprisoned for killing a 10 y.o. white girl. Michael paid the price and John seeks the simple truth.The relationships, past and present, and the mystery of what really happened and by whom 25 years ago keeps the pages turning. I couldn't put it down. It had several surprises and was so tightly constructed that it kept me thinking. I truly liked some of the characters, Josh and Rufus Harms especially; and Judge Knight's discourse about the unfairness of the Army's exemption from being sued by its employees was excellent. I loved this story and highly recommend it."
2,I want my $4.50 back :(,"I would like to say im a huge fan of the short-lived one album punk band. I was hoping this would contain a full concert of the band. instead it was just a 20 min documentary filmed with cheap $30 cameras (again this was 2002) and both music videos for ""There Is"" and ""I Feel SO"" which you can watch for free on youtube.I regret purchasing this, and would reccomened you to save your money, even if you are a huge boxcar and/or Blink fan."
2,Be careful when reading this book,"This book has a lot of interesting and fun-filled facts and trivia. However, for those interested and knowledgeable in natural history there is some incorrect or misleading information. Upon reading the bibliography, I understood why there may be some information that is misleading and misunderstood. There are excerpts from Woman's Day, Time and the Philadelhia Inquirer. It seems obvious that the author is a hobbyist rather than a scientist."
2,Side effect Sleepy??,"I have been trying this product for a week. My pants are not any looser and i feel sleepy through out the day. I want to return the product, but i bought it from a store."
5,best oak ridge boy album ever!!!!!!,"I have been an oak ridge boy fan since 1975, and I have all of the albums they have put out. this is one of the best country bluegrass albums I have ever heard. every song is great!!! my favorites are ""Bad case of missing you"" in which Richard sings the lowest he has ever sung! ""My girl Friday"" Duane takes the lead and tells the story of a devorced father getting weekend visits from his daugter. ""I love you so much it hurts"" is one of William Lee Golden's best songs he has ever sung!! The real prize on the album is ""Saving Grace"" where Joe sings about an elderly man who has to take care of his wife with Alsheimer disease. I cried the first time I heard it. for anyone who likes great contry bluegrass, acoustic music, and if you like the oaks, you must buy this album! it is their best album yet! 5 stars is what I give it, I would give it 10 stars if I could, and please get better William Lee."
3,"Great product, poor shipment","My shampoo came leaking out of the box! Thankfully not too much was wasted, as I really did not want to go through with the process of returning it after paying a lot of money for quality shampoo. If I were you, I would try to get this product from the local salon instead of risking shipment issues."
3,Not as good as advertised,"This is an OK shampoo but doesn't thicken fine hair any better than cheaper, drug store shampoos. Also the directions say to use a small amount as it is supposed to lather up with less . . . not so! I also got a couple other B&B products for fine, limp hair and they aren't any better than the shampoo. In my opinion none of them were worth the high prices."
5,Great Product,Buying this in the large pump bottle is expensive in the short run but very economical in the long run.
2,Not impressed.,"I found it drying and a little irritating. It did nothing but upset my acne.Its also very thin and liquid, it takes quite a lot of effort to get it into a good lather. It smells odd, too, kind of like alfalfa hay.Needless to say I wasn't impressed and likely won't keep using it."
5,This is the real deal!,"At first I was a bit skeptical but at 28 and with bouts of adult acne I had to give this a try. After failed attempts with benzoyl peroxide and Retin-A from my dermatologist I decided to give this a try after doing some research. It has truly cured my facial adult acne; this stuff simply works! Also, it's pretty concentrated so as another reviewer pointed out I would suggest to add some water with it."
1,Thought it would be better,"Although shipping was fast from the seller (Amazon retailer), the bottle arrived leaking in the package. Thankfully, it was only a small amount, but not a good sign.I have used other Dessert Essence products before, and was suprised by this one. The soap is VERY then and watery, and doesn't lather up much at all. It leaks all over the place when you use the pump and half of it goes all over the counter when I use it. I don't use it much at all. I expected more from Dessert Essence.Would not recommend."
1,poor customer service,"I purchased both the 8.5 size and the refill size of this face wash, it works ok and does get the face very clean. I received a container with a defective pump that when pressed would come out from the bottom part of the pump instead of through the spigot. I emailed their customer service and someone responded promptly, stating that they were aware of ""the pump issue"", so I'm assuming it was a manufacturing problem that affected more people than just myself. They promised to send a replacement pump but I never received it. I sent 2 additional emails asking for an update but did not receive a reply. Now I have a huge container of this product that I cannot use unless I buy a pump bottle to replace the defective one I received."
3,Good Value,"I purchased this fold down kennel as a general use crate to temporarily house various animals when needed. It's made of light weight materials, but still a pretty good value for the money. It works well for my needs, but I would not recommend it for heavy or continued use."
5,Growlin' Dead,"(4.5) Incredible show, but not even the stongest of a remarkable run! Pig's a pure force of nature - and not just for his excellent vocal performance, but terrific keyboard work throughout. In fact, this falls in Pig's last extended period of really strong performances...note that it comes almost a year to the day after the Fillmore East shows from which they culled Bear's Choice. Other's have covered it thoroughly, but my standouts are an upbeat Loser, rockin' Bertha, legendary Smokestack, smooooooth China>Rider (dig that transition: breathe in and you're listening to China, exhale and you've moved into Rider!), and great TOO suite into Wharf Rat. Phat, Phast, and Phuzzy - just a fantastic early show! Peace and Love, my friends."
4,Good for a laugh but...,"... definately not worth the $74 this seller is asking for it. Check out illwillpress (the website in which this great set of rants came from). You can buy the cd there for $9 and give a listen to some of the rants that are on the cds/dvds. Fair warning, the language keeps it from being a good thing for a young child to watch or listen to. It is a mix of political rants and humor with a definite adult theme. Very funny and true material for those old enough to enjoy it though."
3,kids-review,well at first i thought it was great my friends said i just had to get it so i played my friends and i loved it then after 20 min i thought well that so wasn't fun the pc is way better get teh pc this one stinks it sucks get sims 2 for the pc or get harvest moon harvest moon better thatn all these games
2,Not that great,"This game, I played it for three hours last night. I am still not even sure what I am doing. I was hopeing that the game is more like the PC game. But this one seems to be a rip off of the first sims for gamecube. The people look disgusting, there isn't even a family aspiration, not as many options. Frankly I would not buy this game. The PC version is 10 times better. I wasted $45 dollars on this game. The ONLY good thing about this game is that you can make your own receipes for your sims when they cook. Hopefully my opinion will change once I figure out what it is that I am supposed to be doing. But that chance doesn't look so good. I will re-post."
3,This game sorta SUCKS!!!!!!,"At first, when i got this game, I thought it was really cool and fun. But now, it sorta sucks, BIG TIME!! You can't have kids and the goals are repetitive. It is boring. You can't have any kids in this game which makes it even boringer. Sure, it will be fun and you will feel like you can't stop playing it at first, but trust me, this game is even worser than The Sims. Don't make the same dumb mistake I did. I could have gotten something better for Christmas. Get it for PC. I hear it's real better. Overall, this game SUCKS!!!!!!"
3,tricked by a tricky ending,"Great concept, beautiful writing, compelling, but the ending was a rotten dirty trick. The author should forget writing any more ""mysteries"" unless the endings get more realistic than this one. I threw it across the room."
4,Early Horror Film,"This is an early horror film made by the same production team that was making King Kong on the same set at the same time. It stars many of the same cast members as appear in King Kong. It is a good movie- about as scary as Frankenstein is to a modern audience. Still, this is an interesting film to watch and the commentary on this film is excellant."
4,Movie vs. DVD - Please Specify!,"I am getting tired of people writing lengthy movie synopsis and critiques and saying nothing about the DVD they watched - ""if"" they watch it. We come to places like Amazon to BUY DVDs and not rent movies. Some titles have multiple releases and trying to find the best can be a challenge and that is where a Review about the DVD is more important than one about the movie itself. Movie reviews can be read at places like IMDb.I had to rate the film to post this message and having seen and own it on the Alpha version DVD (which is a bargain and excellent quality compared to Criterion), I gave it 4 stars."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Lorraine Hunt Lieberson's story is so touching I was prepared to be seduced by the ""Neruda"" songs of her husband, Peter Lieberson. Although her voice is as beautiful as ever I found myself not to be as moved as I am when she is singing from the Classical Canon."
1,Ten Good Minutes of my Life wasted,"This book was chosen by our bookclub by a member who had read it previously. Given that fact we all thought it would be an interesting read. It wasn't. I only managed to read the first 100 pages before I gave up. The writing is disjointed and seems to be trying to be poetic but fails. The characters are all crazy, and not a single one engenders any sympathy or empathy. I found I just didn't care what happened to these people, I didn't feel a flicker of any emotion for any of them and in the end just couldn't be bothered reading any further.Skip this book."
5,You must read this book,"and pass it along to your friends. Only when all of ""the others,"" those who don't understand what it's like to have New Orleans inside your soul, really understand what it's like just living day to day in the war zone that is post-you-know-what New Orleans will the call for action really start. We must rebuild New Orleans, and I believe that this book can help. New Orleans is special, and I haven't had the ability or language to convey that to the people I've met in the five homes I've had in the last year. People just don't understand. Well, maybe after they read this, they'll begin to."
4,Hurricane Katrina,Glad to find another copy for a friend! Anyone living in South Louisiana still feels the impact of Hurricane Katrina.
2,Not what I expected,"I love love love the Jack Black Shaving Cream, but this ""cooling gel"" needs improvement. It doesn't smell very good and leaves my face feeling sticky."
5,Love this yogurt maker!,"I have had this yogurt maker since September and use it weekly. It took a couple batches to 'perfect' my recipe but the process has been fail-proof. The biggest seller for me were the plastic cups; we wanted to be able to take the yogurt in our lunches and the glass did not seem like a good idea (especially for kids). The cups are the perfect size for one portion. I just use a bottle brush to clean the cups. The machine is easy to set up and use. I do not use the starter packs, I simply use plain yogurt as a starter. I love knowing exactly what is in my yogurt plus it takes amazing! Highly recommend."
4,Works great,I bought this for my mom and she has had it for a month now. You have to make a few batches to find the right time for the desired thickness. She loves it!
1,Useless,If you try to make more than half a cup it does not come out well. I did a lot of different tests. Buy the big one.
2,Can someone please help me?,I have tried to make at least 3 batches of yogurt since I got the Donvier and every one is so tart that I cannot eat it. I have tried cooking it longer but it is still too tart. I am using a commercial starter. What am I doing wrong? I would welcome any advice.
2,Bad quality - don't buy,"I have had my Donvier Yogurt maker for a few years now, and I use it maybe once a month to make yogurt. When it works, it makes great yogurt that is incredibly easy to put together.Problem is, it doesn't work. Within the first month the electronic display went out, leaving me to guess how much time I had put into the machine and how much time was left. Another month after that and the top cap that goes over all of the plastic jars warped, so not all of the jars could fit and not all of the heat was being kept in. Finally, a few months ago, the two right sections of cups stopped heating, giving me a jar of milk with a little yogurt culture mixed in. Wonderful.I've never had such an unreliable, quick to break machine in my life. Don't buy this, you are wasting your money."
3,Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Maker,"This yogurt maker is sturdy, and easy to use. The timer feature is very handy, since it will shut the machine off when time runs out. One slight complaint is in the directions, they state a quart of milk should be used, but that will only fill the glasses up half way, I use a quart and a half."
5,Great little workhorse,I really like this product as it functions well and stores well due to its compact size and shape. Yogurt made with this tasted just like the natural variety that I'd purchased from the store. This was my first experience for making the home made variety and I am well pleased with the results!
3,Kylie at its best,This is a great DVD.It contains all of kylie's greatest hits. The concert is very entraining. If you are Kylie Minogue fan you will really enjoy this live performance in Manchester.
1,garbage ink,"Bought many generic inks in the past and all worked reasonably well. This ink leaked, one didn't even work in printer. Second black ink worked, but ran out in one week. With my standard printing usage a black cartridge will last for two months. Came in plastic bags w/ no markings. Will never buy again. Amazon was nice enough to credit me for first bad cartridge, even though was from secondary seller. Rest are going in garbage, where they belong."
3,expect problems when purchasing this item,Because of the low price for this item I did expect problems. One of the ink capsules leaked all over and unfortunately it was the one of the colored ones and not the black of which I have many. I would advise anyone purchasing this product to be very careful when opening the box so ink won't spill all over your desk or carpet. I opened mine on a newspaper which saved me a lot of grief. The magenta didn't damage my desk or anything and I managed to wipe clean all the rest of the sealed ink cartriges.
4,Very pleased,"2 of the 12 cartridges were bone dry. But still, 10 cartridges for $10 beats $40 for 4 cartridges any day. Eventually, when I've used up this big order, I'll re-order from these people again. Oh, and the shipping was very fast. It took 3 days from the click of my mouse to it showing up at my door 950 miles away. :-)"
3,just as good as name brand,"We were going to Office depot and spending 53.00 for a set of 4, but when I bought compatible ones that work just fine for a set of 12 i spent 10.00. so I will be saving some money doing it this way. And they work just fine with my printer. I am very happy."
1,"Cold, Spilled Coffee","Cuisinart is smearing its good name with this one. As everyone else said already, this peice spills coffee all over, and then turns itself off. 30 minutes is basically 15 minutes of brewing, then 15 minutes of you drinking your first cup then coming back to a luke-warm second cup and spilling it all over again because even though you thought you have it figured out, it still spills. Junk. And the stainless steel"
2,Cuisinart DCC-450 4-Cup Coffeemaker,The coffee ends up okay. My issue is that the carafe is poorly designed relative to pouring. You must pour really slowly and carefully so as not to have coffee drip all over from the carafe. I just want to pour the coffee and not think about it.
2,Substandard Cuisinarts Product,"My wife worked for Cuisinarts. She thought their products were excellent. I own a Cuisinarts Convection Oven that is really super. Their four-cup coffeemaker, sorry to say, is junk - well below Cuisinarts standards. It drips and dribbles. It is awkward to fill. Wait until the first time you start to pour out some scalding hot coffee and the coffee dribbles all over the table, the up-coming steam hits your bare hand, you move your hand and the top of the pot falls off and coffee spills all over! The coffee it brews however is tasty. I would not recommend this pot."
5,Works beautifully!,"Nice appearance, works fairly rapidly, and easy to clean up afterwords. I use both the gold filter and a paper filter -- great coffee."
2,Metallic taste,"I searched through these reviews to find out if I was the only one who recoiled at the metallic taste. I see I wasn't. If you want coffee that tastes only like coffee, avoid this thing. Design flaw: Top is hard to open (at least on mine; snaps shut, requires two hands to release). Anyone know of an alternative 4-cup (actually, this is more like a 3-cup)?"
4,saw the tv series first,"OK, I saw the tv series first. Other than the flashforward and a few character names, there is no major similarities between the two stories. I give the book 3.6 stars."
2,"Ok, but not to my taste","Being a fan of the TV series, I approached this book with great enthusiasm. I'm sorry to say I was sorely disappointed. The concept behind the story is interesting - particularly with regard to the contentious topic of the Hadron Collider. Unfortunately, the author failed to live up to the promise. The writing style was dull, the characters flat, and, frankly, I thought twenty one years was too great a jump. I much prefer the six months presented in the television series.I'm afraid this is one of those rare occasions when I prefer the drama of the TV series over the written word."
4,"Interesting, exciting concept","This novel was actually better than I anticipated! As far as story goes, the narrative was compelling enough to keep me turning the pages, even though there was not much action in the physical sense. The next to last chapter was particularly suspensful.Sawyer does a good job of explaining the science in this hard sf novel, so that the lay person will be able to understand it without getting bogged down.The main criticism I have is that the characters are not very developed and I found it hard to develop much empathy with them.The novel can be read and enjoyed apart from the television show, which takes the basic concept and a name from one of the characters and goes off in another direction. Hope they don't dumb down the science, if they even use science as an explanation for the flash forward.I'll check out more of Sawyer's work."
1,"Great idea, horrific result","The main character had 2 main turning points in his life. One was done in summary. The last one -- the big one -- took place ""on screen"" but the author *would not tell us what happened*! I was so angry I wanted to throw the book out the window. I thought only beginning (unpublished) writers pulled that sort of trick on the reader."
2,Ho Hum,"There sure was fiction. But where was the science? I found I was very impatient with the story because it was all uninteresting aftermath, uninteresting chracters, and uninterestingly presented. You'll find yourself skimmming through this book. Skip it."
2,Flashforward,"The book was ok, not much like the TV adaptation, which we really liked. We bought the book to see how the story ends. The differences are so vast, reading the book offered no insight as to how the screenwriters would have ended their story."
3,I'd give this book 3.5 stars..,"This book has a very unique twist on the 'knowledge from the future' genre.. Imagine, everybody in the world ""living"" for 2 minutes their lives 20 years from now. This can have a huge effect on people, as can be expected. This is the premise of this book! I think it is overall a good book, however, it is not written in an ""exciting"" way, I didn't find myself eager to continue every day, and it's sad, because the premise is just *so* good. Also, the author seems to focus on the technology of this occurence, which is kind of silly, since he's ""inventing"" a future technology and really expanding on it.. this really isn't very interesting, and too much time is being spent on it. Other than that, I guess it's worth it after all, although it should be a priority reading if you know what I mean.."
3,Mango Tango,"This is a great bag. I originally saw it and it's smaller version on Dell's website as well as Mango Tango's. It was much cheaper here. However, my 17"" laptop just barely fits so there is no way larger screens would fit. Even though the sizing is incorrect, I still love it. It has just enough space for the computer and some additional pockets for my other things. I like the bag and get compliments all the time."
2,Cute idea...not that great in execution,"The author, Mr. Boyett, definitely has his literary background down pat. He's managed to capture the look but not the soul of each of the writers that he portrays. But the book is banal, the stories aren't very good. They're like one trick ponies, one joke stories that go on for too long.The Star Trek elements will have the inner geek in you smiling but that's about the limit.BTW, the only story in the book that I kind of liked was the Anne Rice Parody, the Vampire LeForge. That was pretty funny."
5,FUNNY AND ECLECTIC,"One reviewer here has faulted Boyett for parodying works the reviewer hasn't read. How can that be Boyett's fault? The more you know, the funnier Boyett's book is. If you don't get it, that says more about you than about Boyett, for goodness' sake."
1,"Looks Nice, But Very Shoddily Made","This toy was a crushing disappointment for my son. He loved the way the dragon looked, but I found it impossible to get the wings to fit into the openings in the dragon's body; when I tried, the tabs meant to hold them in place snapped off. If you buy this, expect to spend a LOT of time using a file and glue to get the toy together."
5,Go Bleach!!!,"I Got This Because I'm A Fan Of Bleach. It Took About 2 Days To Get Here. Its Super Awesome And A Lot Cooler Than I Thought It Would Be. It's Exactly 1.4 in. Tall And 1 in. Wide. It's Completely Durable And Wouldn't Break, Unless You Throw It 100 Feet In The Air. I Wear It All The Time, I Don't Regret Getting It. So If You're Thinking Of Getting It, I Would Recommend It."
5,"Great lugs, quality products, couldn't be happier","[...]I went with the black lugs and gold rims. The setup is great. I am very happy that I picked these lugs. The best part is that they are sort of like dual locking lugs. The Spline key acts as one lock, so unless the would be wheel jacker has a spline key, they are out of luck. Their standard lug nut key will not work on these. The key for the locking lug in this set works great too. The lugs and keys fit great, there was no play in the key setup. This is nice because it keeps the lugs from getting all chipped up. I would have liked to see all black valves in this box, I didn't use the chrome ones that I received. I just picked up some all black ones sitting around the shop. The bag for the keys is a nice addition as well. I would suggest this setup for anyone looking for good / quality locking lugs."
5,Loved It,It is my dream to go to a costume party as W.C. Fields. I bought this as a guide an also enjoyed it much! Now all I need to do is find a Mae West.
3,No picture?,"Be warned: just like the tiny description says, this is NOT the Eternal Clan TWO box set! WHY would McFarlane choose to release TWO Eternal Clan Boxsets within such a short time???Rather, this is a larger scale (10"" or so) repaint of the series ONE Eternal Clan Dragon. The guy with a human rider who was perched on a roof.Still a cool dragon sculpt... but the 'repaint' job wasn't that impressive to me. Basically the same, with some blue and red airpainted on the wings. The feet are now permanently attached to the roof base, providing a MUCH better looking foot and claw, so that is nice.But, overall, really didn't find this dragon essential to my collection. The colors just really don't seem to suit it, and other than being large, doesn't really add much to the original.Still waiting for the series two boxset, which looks awesome in pictures."
5,"""Swell mask, Boss""..........."" What Mask?""","""They often call me Speedo but my real name is the Lightning Bug"".............. ""Touch your head""....."" You bomb the snatch.."" ""Huh?"" ...""I mean snatch the bomb""......Yes, these phrases DO mean something, but not until you've seen J-Men. Proctor and Bergman did an outstanding job developing original dialog to fit the screen clips they used to create a totally new context for the old serial movies from Republic Pictures and others. Even though this is a 24 year old effort the humor is just as sharp and witty today. The soundtrack would now be considered retro, but the entire concept of conquering the Earth with Rock and Roll music makes you wish the Lightning Bug would've won. I managed to tape one of the ""Night Flight"" showings and I'm looking forward to the DVD.My kids know this movie as well as I do, and I've even adopted my email address from it. BUY THIS AND GET A BOX OF DEPENDS - you'll need 'em from laughing so hard."
3,Tie Case for Travel,"This tie case does what it is suppose to do, I guess. It is just pretty bulky. If I had to do it over again, I would probably purchase the travel cases where you roll the ties up. That would take up far less room. Overall a good purchase, just not one I would purchase again."
3,Nothing special,I had this in my wishlist for a while and decided to buy it before travelling over the holidays but didn't really use. Kind of useless for me but the product itself is nice. Zipper works fine though doesn't look like a real sturdy one that can hold up repeated use.
4,Nice case for the price,"I bought it for my business trips and it does the job perfectly, it is not so expensive and it protects the ties. I would say that it is more for 4 ties than for 6 as advertised. I don't have any complaint for it."
3,Travel Tie Case,"This item does what it's supposed to do - hold and protect ties while traveling. I have had some issues with the zipper getting stuck, but it's held together and has not broken (and hopefully it won't). It's a decent item, but could be about $5.00 cheaper than the price it currently goes for."
2,Bad zipper,"The tie case itself is fine, but the zipper is very poor quality: it is very difficult to start it when trying to close the case."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent quality case for a low price. I got exactly what I was looking for. Well designed. A must for someone who travels a lot and needs to bring ties along. No regrets with this purchase.
3,Inexpensive tie case that does the job,This tie case is made of nylon (or some such similar material) - the pictures showing it are accurate. It seems well constructed and is holding up well in the few months that I've had it. The zippers are a bit stiff especially around the corners. My only minor gripe is that it can only hold 4 ties in all - two on each side. The insert within the nylon covering is too stiff to try to get more ties in (usually leather is more flexible). Other than that it serves it's purpose well and for the price is a good buy.
1,Guilt trip,This book hurts more then it helps. I couldn't even finish reading this guilt trip. The only advice this book gives you is pray to God that he forgives you and the horrible act you have commited. This book was like a swift kick in the stomach.
1,anit-choice propagana,"I started this book so I could better counsel women who had recently had abortions or were about to have one. I didn't get past the intro. This is written from an anti-choice viewpoint. There is nothing unbiased or nonjudgemental about this book.Many studies have debunked the ""post-abortion syndrome"" crud these people are spewing.Do not get this book if you are looking for a caring non-judgemental viewpoint. You won't get it here."
1,"For Me, An Failed Experiment","Hypertenol, even taking 2 tablets a day did not lower my BP, or make any difference at all. I gave it a try for about 6 weeks to be certain. After talking to my doctor, he was not surprised - most of these products don't work for most people. If they did we would all be well off controlling BP.YMMV but I believe this is a waste of money for most people."
3,Great case but serious weakness in multiadapt design,"I love the snug fit and design of this case. The first case that I had, didn't allow proper access to the buttons on the side. The case itself seems quite durable but the weak point is in their multiadapt system. The clips seem to only be held on by a thin sliver of plastic either side of the adaptor and over time the stresses of daily of use cause this to eventually break. I am on my second case because of this and have noticed this one is cracking as well. It takes a good few months to happen but I like my cases to last the life of the phone. They need to redesign this to make them thicker and more resistant to stress. If it wasn't for the multiadapt weakness I'd have given 5 stars but I consider it a serious deisgn flaw and so reduce it to 3."
3,Lightbulbs,Several were broken but I suppose part of the fault goes to me for ever thinking they'd make it through the mail perfectly.
1,Manage your mouth but skip this book,"The concept and potential of this book is great. However, the title seems to say it all - in other words, manage what comes out of your mouth, because it can affect your success. Beyond that, save your money. I hesitate to write negative reviews because I ask myself - why would I do that, they didn't do anything to me?! But actually, I bought this book based on the 5 star reviews and it was a let down. Again, the author should be commended for the concept and for meaning well on such an important topic. I just didn't really feel like it helped me manage my mouth better, which is the point of my review. I have books you couldn't pry out of my hands (like ""Keeping your cool under pressure"") but I would gladly give up Managing Your Mouth for one dollar of my money back."
2,Sound good -- picture ....,I am dissapointed that Phish would release this. Someone was asleep at the wheel. The video is almost unwatchable. Why they chose this night to release and not the night before is strange.No establishing of the scene. This show could have been anywhere. Koruda's lights are not given the presentation they deserve. Save your money.
3,Better than the real thing.,"If you've ever heard of Phish, you'd know that this is a rockin' good concert. A great time all around, this is not only recommended to any Phish fan, but to music fans in general!"
2,11 of 12 cans dented!,"This is the second time that I have order a case of these beans. The first time a couple of the cans were dented. With the order that arrived yesterday 11 of the 12 cans were dented.All the packaging was intact with no crushing on the box. 11 of the 12 cans were dented - some horribly. It is clear to me that the seller is providing seconds - which are then being passed along. While they MAY be safe - I don't want to take that chance - and they were not advertised as ""scratch and dent"" type item.Update: Contacted AMZ as item not eligible for return. They told me to keep or throw away the dented cans and they sent me a replacement case in 2 days. All cans in good shape on replacement.Great product - the glitch was somewhere in the order filling process. We will continue to buy this product."
3,Nana UPstairs and Nana Downstairs,I did not like how abrupt the book said that Nana upstairs died and then Nana downstairs died. The story was a little harsh.
4,A Good Deal despite other reviews,This DVD set for $15.00 is a deal compared to buying the individual 3 DVDs for 10 bucks. While it would be nice to get the full season whining about the price is not really a review and neither is this commentary.
2,Nothing to see here....,"If, like myself you have already purchased the 4-5 Episode discs volumes 1-3, then don't waste your money on this, you already have all these episodes. This is the same tired, sell it, sell it again, and then finally give the customers what they want three-card-monty. I bought volumes 1-3 for my own gratification and to entertain my nephew. Now Time-Warner wants to bilk me out of another run of cash for the exact same episodes - I don't think so. Wait until they release the ""Complete"" First season before even considereing spending your money on this franchise!Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Vol. 1Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Vol. 2Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Vol. 3"
1,Not really about the bike ride,"If you're wondering what a cross-country bike ride might be like and whether you might like to do it, don't bother reading this book. There are many other books that more accurately describe the experience, or at least make it seem more appealing. (Barbara Savage's book about her around-the-world journey is quiet entertaining) The author spends most of the book discussing his relationship with his emotionally distant Scandinavian father. Unfortunately, he doesn't really offer anything novel or insigntful on this topic. His musings on religion are equally annoying and sophmoric."
1,Previous review inaccurate,"The current book has no maps, only written mileage and commentary on the trails. the older review must of been earlier printing. You would be better off buying the Maps by DeLorme or Jim Witherell available at most grocery stores up here. I have a 1969 edition of the Katahdin section of the Appalachian Trail edited byJean Stephenson that is more useful than this current book for the hiker/camper."
3,Its OK Because it is naruto.,"This is not a bad set, unfortunately after finishing the box set last night, I must say it is the most boring. Now, if you are like me and refuse to not have an entire show, start to end, we must buy it. But if you are on a budget, or just not as OCD as me, you can go without this disk set.Just my 2 cents, enjoy!"
3,Drag part of naruto,After sasuke leaves the naruto show definitely tended to have its moments when you would rather watch sonic x. But of course as with every anime series what is the point to buy all the narutos without every single season box. The thing I dont understand tho is out of all the box set volumes y would they make this one the most expensive. But yeah buy dis dvd set to continue your naruto collection.
4,Crows for kids,"Bought this CD for my son after I went to his HS graduation. I was playing Bob Seger & Eric Clapton CD's in the rental car & he had never heard of either. He liked them & I thought that he would also like the Crows & maybe introduce his friends into some good music, from the ""Old Man's"" era. Good luck with that."
5,i think you'll like it,its too bad these guys broke up. the crowes reminded me alot of old rod stewart. you can feel the blues influence in the way rich robinson plays. and cris robinson's soulful voice. this is a must own cd
4,Season 4,season 4 was what i was respecting but as for the ben 10 movie i was disappointed it was just the same as the tv broad cast you could tell where the commercials where there wasn't any Dolby d enhancement all in all a turn off so i cant give it 5 stars.
5,Fun Series for Kids,"My son loves Ben 10! This is a fun series for kids that has action, adventure, friendship and superheroes."
2,Can't follow her!,"I've had this tape for a very long time and never tried it. Now that I am home I decided to give it a try, of course doing modifications and such. I like Denise Austin, but I hadn't done any of her tapes since the '80's...now I know why. She can't cue to save her life. She knows what she is doing but the cuing is sloppy, its a shame I really wanted to like this DVD."
1,typical denise austin,"If you like jerky, bouncy moves, this workout's for you. If you like a deep, focused workout, go for the Firm or FitPrime workouts. The aerobics portion is bouncy and balistic and the strength training (weights) isn't enough to do any good."
2,"This is a workout for a ""down"" day","I am an avid fitness enthusiast who works out 5 days a week. This was my first Denise Austin workout. The first of the 2 workouts was very low impact and I didn't even break a sweat. In the 2nd workout (I did them back to back), I found the weight segments useful. Each aerobic interval was simple, repetitive, and useful for ""light"" days. (She didn't do any of them long enough to really make me sweat.) In general, this tape is okay for something to mix in on the days you don't really feel like doing too much."
3,Shut up already!!,"As an avid home exerciser, I was excited to try one of Denise Austin's videos. I typically do Tae-bo, but I love step as well so I gave this one a try.On the plus side, this is a great workout for intermediates and really gets your heart pumping. On the other hand, I don't think she stops talking for 5 seconds during the entire thing. I actually turned it off in the middle, because I couldn't take her anymore!! Don't get me wrong, I like when instructors encourage you, but she takes it way too far. I will not use her tapes again!"
2,Only use this if you like A LOT of jumping in your workouts.,"If you like high-impact aerobics, this is your video. Denise's cueing is awful as usual, but her signature style is still there. The people working out behind her seem like normal folks (not gym rats). She uses a step and hand weights for this interval training video and incorporates kickboxing, basketball, etc. I didn't care for this video, but I don't like overly jumpy workouts."
4,Great Cardio But Falls Short on Strenght Training,"I use this dvd to get my cardio workout in about 35 minutes but if its strength training you are looking for this is not the video for you. After I do my workout on the dvd it leaves me yearning for more weights which I then have to do. I then bring out my 5lb hand weights and lift for about 15 min then I do sit-ups for another 15 min. Since I always focus on my abs and this video fall short in that department. All and all it's a great video to get your heart pumping and I love her perkiness, it makes you want to keep moving."
5,great workout,I love this workout..I have lost 20 pounds just doing this workout at least 4 days a week and watching what I eat.I love the different workouts you can do.
1,Don't Waste your Money JVC 511BK,I tested this out with the MATRIX it worked great so I bought it. Plays old movies but it is hit or miss with new releases. Mostly Miss. Will never buy a JVC product again.
5,"fast delivery, in great shape!",The toaster was delivered to my mom in a very short time and it was in excellent condition. She really loves it! Thank you!
5,A great little toaster,"I really like this toaster. The price is right and it toasts up quickly. It's compact and is very nice looking if you want to keep it out. It is small enough to store in the cabinet, that's where mine is. You can toast English muffins and bagels really nicely,, a good buy"
3,Two Years,Not bad. I bought this toaster in January 2010 and it broke down on me May 2012. So I got 2 years and 5 months use out of it. Most toasters never lasts very long. I wish I can find one that lasts much longer than that. Anybody know of one?
1,Why don't toasters make good toast anymore?,"I must agree with many of the other reviews. I chose the Cuisinart toaster because it is a good brand. However, I too find that I absolutely HAVE to turn the toast (or the waffle or the bagel) during toasting. You cannot just press down the button, go make coffee and come back to toast. You come back to a piece of toast or waffle that is too dark on one side and no color on the other. To make waffles, I keep turning them and then take them out when one side is done. I then butter that done side and then put it on TOP of the toaster, push down the lever and toast the bottom side. It melts the butter this way too. But oh, what a bother. Very disappointing toaster."
1,Worst Toaster Ever Made,"I have never been so disappointed in a Cuisinart product as I have with this toaster from....I cannot get one slice of bread to toast on both sides (one will be toasted and the other side will not), if I increase the number on the side to a 4 I'm either going to get super toasted on one side and barely on the other or lighter toasted but still with one side non-toasted. My mother went to WM and bought the cheapest toaster and it out-performed this toaster by a long shot. Maybe I got a lemon; but, it's kind of tiresome when you never know how your bread will be that morning even if it's been on the same setting."
1,Latch broke after less than 1 year,"Well, it was a fine toaster... It toasted bread, had an adjustable setting that actually worked, and had good sized slots. However the latch to hold down the handle has broke after around 1 year of ownership. And while I'm handy, it doesn't look very user serviceable, and the cost to send it in (assuming cuisinart is reputable with their warranty, but I don't know) doesn't seem worth it."
1,two years for a toaster- come on!,"always was too hot on anything but the lowest setting, but yesterday the bread would not stay down- Glad its gone- the only redeeming variable was I could pick it up right after use because of the plastic case."
5,Cuisinart toaster,"I was very happy with the quality of the toaster. It is especially good in that it easily accommodates the ""oversided"" slices of home made bread as well as bagels.It's a delight to use when I compare it to one of those mass-produced ""cheapie"" models."
5,Great Toaster,Product is consistent with toasting depending on your setting. A 2 setting always toast the same etc etc. I would buy it again.
1,Bad Little Toaster,"( I bought from Macy's, not Amazon.)This is an amazingly bad product from a company that I mistakenly thought was a quality leader.Bread comes out unevenly toasted on one side and nothing on the other side. Didn't anyone at Cuisinart notice this during product testing? To compensate, I turn the timer down, then when it pops I flip the bread and run it again. It' a small thing, but I'd rather not do it.The buttons on the outside -- ""Bagel"", ""Defrost"", ""Reheat"" -- don't do anything I can discern. They should have a ""Make toast that is evenly browned on both sides in one cycle"" button. That would be useful.(There's also a silly ""Cancel"" button which just pops the toast. I'm trying to imagine the design meeting where someone said ""How will people be able to stop the toaster in an emergency?"" and someone else said, ""I've got it! We'll add a Cancel button, just like they have in Windows."")My guess is any other toaster on the market at any price would be a better choice."
2,Stopped working in 22 months,"Oct. 2010 update to my previous review - this toaster stopped working 22 months after purchase. Electromagnet that holds down the toast carriage won't engage, only one side of heating elements heat up. Will toast one side of your bread if you hold down the handle the whole time.This is a fine toaster, good looking and efficient. Since we've only had it for a few weeks I can't comment on its durability. It has one annoying design flaw. This is the only kitchen appliance I have ever encountered in my life that has a glowing orange light on even when it is off! This is disconcerting for a device that has heating elements since I think the unit is stuck on every time I enter the kitchen and is a possible fire hazard, even though everything is normal. I have no idea why the manufacturer decided to go against one of the basic, simple conventions of electric appliance design in this way."
5,great little toaster,We're happy with this toaster. We like the small footprint on the counter and the slots are wide enough for bagels and english muffins. Most importantly it's producing good toast!The only minus is the fact that the light stays on as others have mentioned.
1,Cuisinart does not me quality,"Just as the others said, this toaster barely browns one side and half toasts the other. will never buy an appliance with the Cuisinart name on it. Going back to the good old Kenmore."
2,Toasting Unsatisfactory,The toaster does not toast evenly. One side is much more done than the other.
3,it's a toaster,"This toaster works just fine...nothing fancy. We used to have a Krups toaster that lasted several years, and we were very satisfied with it. We wanted to get the same one, but were shocked at the price it was going for ($150). I don't believe we paid that much when we bought it years ago...we might have had a gift card as well. Either way, this Cuisinart toaster is a satisfactory unit. My only complaint is that the push-down block is smooth & thin, and my finger often slips when trying to press it down. You kinda have to make a conscious effort to press it down."
1,Burns toast at lowest setting,"This toaster is the worst I've ever had. Even at lowest setting, it burns my toast. Someone please explain how to reset this so I don't have to manually watch and remove before it burns."
2,Tis book is extremely biased.,"This is a typical protestant approach, I am episcopalean who knows better that catholics unless they are from a third world background know better when praying. If they pray they are only asking for intersession, they assume mary will ask God. I think protestnts and catholic should settle their differences, becuase theres gonna be much more things to worry about in the future, if people even go to church at all. Like some new theory will try to prove us believer wrong.We should stick together and encourage each other to be faithful, not push each other out of their religion. Theres more to go after other than catholics."
5,"Interesting, engaging, well rounded","Racket Science is a delight to the ears. The clever, bizarre song titles belie the depth of musical expression the trio conveys in them. O'Meara, Gerety and Roulat are cohesive, clear and flowing in each track. Listen and enjoy!"
4,Mostly about the Frame,"Lots of information of good information on the frame, variations on the frame, building the frame, etc. The mat and mount sections seemed a bit light, but the information was good. I would say the mat and mount section was on the beginner side but framing ran well into the intermediate range. Overall a decent book but not quite great unless you are more interested in builing your own frames."
3,Wouldn't play the first MP3 disc I tried.,"I ripped two CDs today by copying them directly to my CD-R in my E drive. Both CDs are exatly the same, they came from the same pack of Sony CD-Rs. The MP3s were from CDs I had ripped at 320kps and I burned the same songs, in the same order, on both CD-Rs. The first one I burned couldn't be read by the Sony Psyc, it just said ""No File Found"". I put that one back into my computer and it played fine. I took it out, examined the surface and tried it again in the CD player. I got the same results. The second CD I burned did play in the Sony CD player, so I'm not sure why the first one didn't work. I guess you have to be willing to throw away perfectly good CD-Rs if you only plan to play them with this player. The CD player does sound great though. I only wish it had a back light on the display window."
2,Pay for what you get,"Simply put, for 30 dollars more you can get something that will actually make carving enjoyable. I received this as a gift, am happy to have something to carve with, but am already in the market for another carving set. It's too light weight, flexible. The knife does keep its edge nicely."
1,Not quite what was expected,"Based on the images and the one positive review, I thought I had found the right calculator at the right price. Alas, my copy of the calculator,new and tightly sealed up, only flops fully open. The hinge is very loose. That would sort of be ok, but there was one other flaw. The battery came as dead as a doornail. The calculator works fine if I place it about 8 inches below a natural daylight (Ott) lamp. Return would be hard as it is open, and packaging damaged beyond use. And simply buying a new battery is not all that easy as it's an oddball button type. Amazon sells them, but with shipping and shipping time (I needed this calculator now), it's not worth the it. Since it was cheap, I'll probably just toss and buy a far less useful calculator locally tomorrow morning. I guess Royal's Chinese quality control is a bit lacking."
4,Very good dock but..,"The dock itself is very well crafted, actually a lot better than a previous one I had purchased a few years back. The blue light on it can be a little annoying but I don't mind it as much how tight the Palm sits on the dock. Using two hands to take it off the dock is not a bad thing but it would off been nice if it had an eject system built in."
4,Great food processor ...,"This is a great food processor of the perfect size for dishes I cook for my family of three. But Amazon offers the choice of Items ""frequently bought together"" this : Cuisinart 3-Cup Food Processor Duet Attachment, White by Cuisinart $34.00. This accessory is for a Cuisinart BLENDER, not for this little food processor. Sign me disappointed."
4,nice unit,"My wife wanted a new Cuisinart. so I thought that a step up from her old one would be nice.I'm a proud recipient of the benefits (she's an AWESOME cook), and I might end up using it a few times myself when I cook for her (guys, don't be WUSSIES... Cook for your ""significant other"" once in awhile; The benefits outweigh the drawbacks... TRUST ME!!!)"
1,cuisinart handyprep 3 cup food processor dfp3,"I admit, i am not so great a reading instructions. Every time I read them, I fall asleep. But i still haven't been able to use my handy prep. the cord is too short so it doesn't reach across my stove to the work table. My other plug is on the floor in front of the counter and the cord isn't long enough to reach from the floor to the counter. So i tried preparing food on the floor, crawling around. But i still can't get it to work. It's my first time to try a food processor. I've heard so many great things. However, with the short cord, and my inability to even get it to turn on, it is all too disappointing for me. I get so angry that they couldn't make a cord long enough to be useful. I feel like it's a mean trick. I'm going to get a nice grater instead. I can use a grater on the counter without having to buy an extension cord."
4,thumbs up,"I really enjoyed this novel - a good mix of the funny, series/philosophical, and absurd. While the protagonist is fairly unsympathetic, he'll ring true to anyone who has ever thought about another person: `How can s/he be so smart on one level, and so utterly clueless on another level?' This work also reminded me somewhat of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in its whimsical descriptions of big issues like evolution and genetics."
5,Aimee Mann makes the wait worth it,"Any Aimee Mann fan will tell you that she is one of the strongest and most intellegent artists without a big record label behind her. She released ""Bachelor No.2"" on her own because Interscope Records (her former label) didn't think the content was deemed ""radio friendly"". That shows the amount of integrity that Aimee has, she ventured out and made her own record label and bought back the rights to ""Bachelor No.2"". There are many excellent tracks that most people will never hear because of a lack of commercial backing. It's a shame that the most talented artists aren't always the most heard. ""How Am I Different"" the album's first cut tells Aimee's story. All the tracks will grab you and send you to a time in your life that you think you have been to before. ""Satelite"", ""Red Vines"", and ""Ghost Town"" are the best new songs. If you love Aimee, you'll love her more. If you don't know Aimee, get it right now."
2,Component Failures,"After 13 months of occasional use, the hard drive failed. Two months later the power supply died, the next month the motherboard went south.Based on that experience with Sony, I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,I am just not sure,I got this Fortune Telling Fish and I have used it on several occasions.I am just not sure though if it is accurate. I mean sure I could just be biased and maybe I intentionally shaped events to not coincide with what the fish predicted. But shouldn't the fish have seen that coming?
4,Very good!,It is a very effective deodorant. It lasts all day and doesn't have a super strong perfume like others.
3,Not what I thought,This is a book about writing/journaling through mental/psychiatric pain. I thought it would be about physical pain. I've not read much of it. I will donate it to the local library.
3,soft metal shoehorn no good piece of @#^%,bends too easy didnt work as well as i expected wouldn't buy another one nor recommend this to a friend
3,so-so toaster,"Toast function is inconsistent -- placed regular slices of bread in for regular toast at a medium setting (4 or 5 out of 10) and the toast burned. Learned to put the setting on 1 for regular toast, but sometimes it toasts just right whereas other times it's not toasted enough. Bottom line is you just have to keep an eye on it to make sure things are toasted to your liking. Regular bagels fit fine in there; oversized ones might not fit so well. Not overly impressed, but not disappointed enough to send it back, either."
1,Worst toaster ever.,I owned this toaster for over two years. It worked ok for the first month and after that it was garbage. It never toasted the bread evenly and it has nothing to do with the bagel setting. I never used any of those functions. It also would rarely pop the toast up on it's own and I burned many slices of bread because of it. This is not new technology and there is no excuse for not being able to make a toaster that doesn't do the bare minimum of tasks.
1,Get. Another. Toaster.,"I thought I would be the exception, I guess I was wrong. Like other reviewers have said, on every setting, one side of each slice gets burnt and the other side is barely toasted. I've watched it so many times (I have to, to keep the toast from burning) and it's apparent that the outside burners and the very middle burner just get way hotter than the two other burners in the middle. The result is the ""inside"" of each pair of slots barely heats up and - boom - uneven toast. What a shame."
2,Slooowwwww and uneven results,"We have owned this toaster for about 4 years and it has been consistent, I will give it credit for that! However, it is extremely slow to toast, I am talking 4 or even 5 minutes. The resulting toast is also unevenly toasted. It has been like this from day 1, I suppose I should have returned it. Instead I am giving it to my daughter for her college rental and buying me a new one. And it will be a different brand."
4,One side toaster,Like the other reviewers the toast always comes out darker on one side. I do really enjoy being able to make four pieces of toast with two different settings. This has not been a major issue but when you pay that much money for a toaster you'd think it would work more effeciently for your needs. I do really like all the different settings and there is plenty of room for your bagel even when not divided exactly in half which is usually my case. It's still not a bad toaster.
2,Nice Covering but Doesn't Work,"Looked good but doesn't work well. Left it in the freezer overnight and used it next day. It does not get or stay cold enough for meaningful use. An ice pack should be cold, not a little cool. Has a nice covering with a Velcro strap which is very useful. I was thinking maybe I should dump the insides and just put a plastic bag with ice in that covering. Then again, that would just be an ice bag with a Velcro strap. Going to see if I can find something similar that really gets cold."
2,...,"When i purchased the book, the condition was described as ""good"" or ""like new"" but when I received it, the condition was very bad. I was disappointed. Even though Amazon has fully refunded me, I still don't understand why they described the condition wrong."
5,JFK Files,This book is unbelievable. I think it is the real account of John F Kennedy's assination. I am angered with all the political people involved or aware of the sceduled assasination that stood by and watched it happen.
5,A thorough insight,"I've been studying the JFK conspiracy for some time now and I ran across Mr. Dankbaar's work some time ago, after seeing and browsing through his webpage, which intrigued me enough to order the package (books and dvds). I must say that the book is a very thorough insight of the events that might have happened and that most probably did happen during this grisly event in US history. A must for anyone who isn't satisfied with official explanations and cover-ups."
5,My cats approve!,My cats love the falling water and I am happy with the product as well as the service!
4,Like the fountain but not the reservoir,I agree with EnchantedGal. The fountain itself is quiet and holds more than enough for several days (and I have 3 cats). I bought the extra reservoir so I wouldn't have to fill it as often. One of my cats has found a way to actually detach the stand even though there are 2 latches. It would be helpful if it locked in place somehow.
5,This Can NOT Be Bad At All,"Believe me, I'm a pokemon expert. Ask me to name all of the existing pokemon, I can do it. I've read previews in Nintendo Power magazine, and this game will be so good that my parents might just have to confiscate my DS and Pokemon Diamond because I'll play it so much. Five star game. No less."
4,Pokemon,My son was very happey at the speed of the shipment and that it was with the nintendo ds system
4,Great fun,"This is a great game. The kids and I love playin and trading. Get pearl for your other DS and then you can play with the kids. Graphics are really good, gameplay is smooth and straight forward."
5,About as much fun and variety as you could ask for!,"For a turn based RPG, this really is quite fun. I am a fan of retro RPGs, and just started playing Pokemon after picking this one up for a good price. Though the series has been 'kiddified', I find that I enjoy the tongue in cheek humor and deep storyline much more than I expected.As an adult, I say give this a try, it is truly a fun game and it's quite humorous. It does remind me a bit of the humor (and gameplay in a way) from Earthbound (great game!).Pros: Lot's of quirky extras like Pokemon fashion shows and tunnel digging; great graphics; lots and lots of fun; quirky humor; addictive; good item system; good use of second screen with poketach accessory (part of the game); online fun!Cons: Some repetitive humor; slow battles get a bit tedious at times; sometimes perplexing"
3,"Works, but...","I bought two of these when I got DSL. The filter does indeed filter. But it is difficult to install (I had to pound on top to get it to lock in place), and it doesn't look nice -- imagine sticking a somewhat-used bar of soap between your phone and the wall mount. It wobbles a bit, too."
2,Far From Mondo Macabro's Best Release,"this film doesn't really warrant a lengthy synopsis. it feels like an exercise in patience. the story makes no effort to find any logic in ANYTHING! the scares fail on all levels. the nudity would only excite teenage boys. it's just pretty crappy and every scene feels awfully padded out. there are a few unintentionally humorous bits but not enough to really keep anyone entertained. the end was painfully contrived but mildly interesting visually, when the living dead stab the main characters to death. i give an extra star for this very brief sequence and for the fact that the film makers actually had the balls to kill off the main characters (all though this is only temporary). this is the first disappointing release from Mondo that i've viewed. on that note, they did do a great restoration as expected from this label. too bad the movie sucks."
5,Another Sharpie Deal,"When this was offered as a ""lightning deal"" it was much too good to pass up. One of Amazon's truly bargain deals."
4,"Works well, but vapor will make you sick",This marker provides dark black color on nearly any surface. It smells like paint while it dries and could make you sick. Try not to use it inside.
2,iffy,i bought 2 of these...one stopped working the 1st week i got it...some wire or somthing got disconnected i still have the other one too and that one still works....this is really awesome..i even used it on myself a couple of times..its a good ice breaker
1,"Don't waste your money, seriously","These pens were only a few dollars so I guess one gets what they pay for but I ordered 2 of them. What I got was one that was completely broken and unusable & another that I tried then passed to someone else to try. After that the 2 halves wouldn't stay together so I guess I'm going to slap some glue or tape on it. It was a gag gift anyway, of course, so it'll be going right in the trash - for more than 1 reason. Seriously, don't waste your money on these."
2,WEAK SHOCK,THE SHOCK POWER OF THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SHOCKING AT ALL I TRIED IT ON SEVERAL PEOPLE DID NOT IMPRESS ME AT ALL OR THEM SHOCK WAS WEAK
1,Not a review of the item,"I never received this camera. I tracked shipment online, noted it was delivered. I went to the post office, they said it was scanned when delivered. Nobody can tell me where the camera is and what happened to it. Although I believe it is not Amazon's fault,the experience will hold me back from purchasing online and having it delivered by mail. Just FYI.Andy Tan"
5,Easy to use and AWESOME preview screen!,"I purchased this camera as an upgrade to my husband's older canon camera, which was another GREAT BUY. The SD 630 is as easy to use as the older Canon camera's, but boasts a new larger preview screen. My husband loves his new camera and looks forward to taking MANY pictures with it in the future."
5,Canon Powershot SD630 Digital ELPH Camera,"I purchased one for my daughter to take pictures of my grandson, and was so pleased that I purchased one for my wife, as well. It is a wonderful camera and I get new pictures every week. Thank you!"
5,Exceptional Camera!!!,"This is the firat camera i have owned, and i have to say it has amazing features (i.e. 3"" Screen, when you turn it autumaticlly the picture turns over too etc.) i give you my word you will not regret or want to return this product!"
5,Great for kids and all else,"Don't need the view finder. The screen is plenty bright and gets brighter as the sun does (via f-stop monitoring). Plus, the continuous setting is great for kids. Takes on average 4 shots/sec. This means, in fast action scenes, you're guaranteed to get a couple of good shots. I had a Canon 330 before, the 630 blows the 330 away. Its light weight, durable, small.Great pictures, great videos. Who needs a camcorder?"
3,No new sounds from Miss J,"Janet, after a slight hiatus from The Velvet Rope, comes back with her new movie role in The Nutty Professor 2 and a new song from it. As the title suggests, it Doesn't Really Matter if Janet doesn't write something different cos her fans adore her the same. This is generic Janet stuff and the riff sounds like almost any other Janet-Jam-Lewis composition. Listen to the remixes though, they offer a more refreshing take on the otherwise lacklustre song. Maybe it's time dear Miss J writes with some other people. Too much of something for the past 14 years may prove too much for us to take."
3,Nice item,The preserves were fine but the amount seemed quite small for the price plus shipping costs. I do know that harvesting these tiny berries may be labor-intensive though and this may account for the higher costs.
3,Back From the Brink,"Very good for answering questions about trauma. Should be good for relatives, family and friends in understanding the actions or behavior of a loved one."
5,Fantastic Guide for a Bygone Era,"I got this copy about 10 years ago on a back rack of a flea market. I have enjoyed reading it over and over again. From the references of nabbing your own Clark Gable to not dressing like glamorous screen queens Joan Crawford or Ginger Rogers. The illustrations are reflective of the times as well. One includes a woman trying to drag a mule with the above reference comparing a man to a mule. ""Some girls fail because they try too hard. Men and mules have a great deal in common. Try to force them and they immediately go balky on you."" Chapters cover important topics such as: ""Breaking Down His Resistance""(chapter 2) to ""Petting-the Pursuit of Happiness"" (chapter 6). There are so many priceless quotes from this book! Recommended reading for all generations."
4,A relic of its time,"A copy of this book was given in 1938 to my mother, then single, by her fellow employees at Public Service of Indiana in Lafayette. Although some of it is tongue-in-cheek, considered altogether it's a serious guide to the etiquette and attitudes of the 1930s, telling a woman the tactics she need employ to get a husband. Mother was dating someone then, a man she never seriously saw as husband material. In 1940 she met the man she would marry a year later (and was with till he died in 2000) and the man she'd been dating in 1938 met and married her husband's sister in early 1942; they were together for over 60 years. The length of their marriages was also a relic of an earlier time..."
3,Rating. . .,Someone should rate this. . .I'd like to know if it's worth the price.I would very much appreciate it if someone did! Thank you!
2,reserving final judgement on this grinder,"This coffee grinder was purchased to replace an older Cuisinart dcg-12c grinder. The older grinder was not inoperative, we just felt a new one should be on hand in case of failure. The new grinder sometimes sounds as though it is grinding its own gears instead of the coffee beans. There appears to be some uncertainty as to proper seating of the grinding bowl. Not sure we'll be keeping this grinder so an update of this review may be required."
2,Previous review are true,"While looking for the instruction manual because i just remembered that the bowl is suppose to come off so I can wash it, I came across these reviews, which are all true. It doesn't grind small, no matter how much you try. It is persnickity with other seeds besides coffee, such as flax and sesame. The bowl doesn't release and so it is difficult to wash. It is loud. You have to kee checking to see if it is ground up. It creates a mess what taking the lid off. Mine does work and it has for a fewmonths now, so at least it is reliable thus far. If you can get it on sale, I go for it, but the money spent is not worth it at all."
1,Junk!,"This grinder was a gift so I didn't feel I could return it. It never worked -even out of the box. My husband modified it so that we could use it (something in the way the blade components attached to the spinning mechanism). Then, a week later, the on/off button broke (cheap plastic nubbins). It could still be used if you carefully placed the button in the slot. It never ground beans properly -especially small (1/2 C beans) batches. You ended up w/dust to whole beans! It only did slightly better on larger batches. I have other family members who also received it as a gift. They didn't have to modify it to make it work but the grinding is very poor/uneven. I give it 1 star because you can put the bowl in the dishwasher & it looks nice sitting on the counter. We replaced it w/a KitchenAid BCG1000 which works great!"
3,Good and bad,"I had the same experience as others here: After six months of use, the thing started sounding like a 737 on takeoff, which was a major bummer, because, as others have noted, it's a nicely designed grinder, very easy to clean, and the least messy of any I've ever used.I contacted Cuisinart and the replaced the stainless grinding bowl assembly for free, but the loud noise continues, and I share others' frustration that the grind is just not consistent -- big chunks mixed with fine powder mixed with a few whole beans here and there. Sadly, I'll be replacing this with something with a little more oomph."
2,Doesn't quite make the grade...,"This grinder looks great, has some great features, but unfortunately lacks in the most important area. The grind!It has a removable grinding bowl, which is very convenient, especially since it's dishwasher safe. I love that feature. Makes cleaning easy. This grinder also looks great. I love the stainless steel, even if it's a bit larger that other grinders. It's also fairly quiet...at least relative to my last two grinders.Now, the grind. This grinder takes longer than others I've owned and is not that consistent. Sure, it holds a lot of beans at once...one of it's selling points to me. But, as it grinds a full load, it doesn't grind evenly. The fine grounds get packed down below the blades and the top grounds are too coarse. Even with a small load though, it has trouble creating very finely ground coffee....and it takes a while.Sad to say, my final words are, ""not recommended"". If I can find the receipt, I'll be returning this one."
1,Won't Purchase Cuisnart Again Ever,"My husband bought this grinder for me for Christmas. The plastic blade assembly just shattered. He purchased this for $50, and it lasted 6.5 months? I called Cuisnart, and explained that the plastic blade part has shattered, and the grinder is only 6.5 months old. They told me it was under warranty, but unless I had the receipt, I had to pay $14.00 plus shipping for the replacement part! Why would I pay for parts and shipping when I could go buy another one and have it today for the same money? It would take me hours of time to even try and locate a receipt - in the same time I could purchase another. He bought the Cuisnart because he thought for the price that it a. must be good quality and b. they would stand behind their product. Neither happened, so I will go and purchase a cheap one. Those have always lasted longer than 6 months."
1,Stopped working after one month,"I loved the grinder for the first month - worked well and was quiet. Then, after one month of use, it just stopped working. What a waste."
2,"2nd try, never again",We had previously bought this model but had to replace it after about a year when it stopped grinding. The new one we got worked for about a month before the basket got stuck. So now when we need to get the coffee out we need to tip the entire grinder over. I wrote to Cuisinart and they never responded. The only good thing I can say is that it does grind the coffee well but if you can't get the coffee out who cares?
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,MOTOR QUIT AFTER 6 MONTHS!!! CALLED CUISINART AND EVEN THOUGH i SENT IN THE REGISTRATION THEY SAID NO RECIEPT NO WARRANTY!!!THIS UNIT HAS A 18 MONTH WARRANTY AND LOOKS STURDY BUT IS JUNK!
1,Had to return twice!,"I have had nothing but problems with my grind central grinder. I am on my second one, having to return the first because the cup wouldn't release and now the second one is doing the same. I though cuisinart was a good brand so I'm really disapointed. I would suggest buying a different brand."
1,Not a good product,"I bought this grinder @ Bed Bath & Beyond because I had a $10 off coupon and my old grinder that I had for a few years finally gave out. I liked the fact that you could wash the grinding part in the dishwasher. It worked great for about 2 weeks. However, after that, I could not twist off the grinder part anymore to clean it. No matter what I did, it just wouldn't come off. I took it back and exchanged it for another. Well, the second one was bad for another reason. The coffee would spill out around the base part of the grinder. Two defective machines in a row? I took it back and got my money back. I got a Mr. Coffee grinder @ Wal-Mart. We'll see how that works. Hopefully better than the Cuisenart."
1,BEYOND BAD,The first one I purchased burned out with the second grind. I returned it and bought another one (fool that I am) and it has burned out in a month of use. DO NOT purchase this product.
1,"Lousiest, Messiest, Goofiest grinder ever","The matching coffee pot is really good, but they must have given the engineers a vacation for this one. The grind quality is terrible - you get boulders and dust. You have to actually take the lid off, stir the grind around, then continue grinding. The button sticks, the lid retains coffee dust, and overall this should be passed over. Get a burr grinder."
2,Messy and inconsistent!,"Our family loves Cuisinart products, but this one is not up to their standards. It grinds rather inconsistently (which I can live with), but it is difficult to use without making a mess. First, the grinds come up over the cup while grinding and get in under the removable cup area, making grounds go everywhere when you are finished. Plus, this makes the cut difficult to get off so you can tap the bottom to get the grounds out. Will not buy a Cuisinart coffee grinder again."
1,Cuisinart DCG-12BC Stopped working after 4 uses,"I received this grinder for Christmas and unfortunately threw away the packaging. The grinder worked great for the first 4 times and then it just quit. I thought maybe the bowl wasn't secured or the blade had come loose. Don't waste your money on this product and I thought Cuisinart was a good product. If you do, save receipts and boxes for at least a month."
4,"Nice look, but inferior grinding","It does a pretty good job overall, but it does tend to leave a few large chunks of bean. I really like the removable bowl."
1,Avoid at ALL costs. Completely cheap junk!!!,Motor burned out and died after about 20 uses. Absolutely worthless product. Will never buy a Cuisinart product again. I need to get in this business of selling junk for money.
1,Not what I would expect from Cuisinart,"I received this as a present. 2 months after I got it, the bowl would not come off anymore. As this was the reason I wanted this one, I brought it back to the store it was purchased in, and did get an exchange. Less than 5 months later, this one has just stopped working. I also agree with many of the other reviewers who are disappointed in the grinding. It does leave a lot of large chunks and unground beans. I have been using my blender which has worked better than this grinder ever did. I have written to Cuisinart and am waiting for a reply. I have other Cuisinart products and have been happy with them, but would recommend that you pass this one up. I have also been looking into other grinders, and it seems that most recommendations favor the burr grinders."
1,"Poor Quality Motor, Poor Quality Grinder","I received this item as a gift. It worked for a few months, but even with moderate use (a few times a week), the motor burned out and the grinder turned into a block sitting on my counter. I had expected more from Cuisinart, but this model has more poor reviews than it should to still remain on Amazon. It should be removed!!"
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this to match my coffee maker (which I love) and I was very disappointed. It takes a while to grind the beans and there is always a burning smell. After a few months of use (daily) I noticed pieces of the plastic holding the blade in place started falling off. It looks like the entire blade is going to come out now...also bought the can opener that matches the coffee grinder and coffee maker and it never worked...the way it was designed it was almost impossible to get it to catch on to the can!
1,Junk-very loud,"The button you press to activate grinder broke within a few months. I can still use it but it's a pain since it pops out all the time. (the tab that holds the button in place snapped off) Also, it's very, very loud. Much louder than most machines. I don't expect it to be a whisper but I'm fairly certain my neighbors can hear me use it. Also, you have to shake the grinder while using it to get an even grind....otherwise, you get chunks of useless bean. Lastly, I'm 38 years old, not an overly sensitive elderly person who is the usual suspect for problems with noise. Take care and good luck with a different product :)"
2,spices? please,"If you're looking for a spice grinder, quietly pass this product by. The huge capacity makes grinding any small amount of spice an impossibility.Find a better grinder."
5,"Big Value, Great Price","This is one of the best values I have found in a long time. It has the best of features offered by the more costly grinders, in a small, sleek design, and a Great Price. I got this for my hubby as a gift, and he loves it. We have tried it with various types of coffee beans, and for diffrent types of coffee makers and it's seems to be compatiable for all."
4,wake up call!,"This grinder grinds very well and quickly. Good quality and like any other grinder it sends my hound into a barking rage. Have to wrap towel around and atop grinder before I press the button. Don't let that deter you, though. It is very efficient and quite nice looking. It even has a separate top to keep your ground coffee fresh until it's time to brew."
2,Can't recommend this,"As others have noted, the grind is not particularly consistent, but that's the nature of blade-type grinders in general and it didn't bother me that much. I love the bowl that is removable from the base, for easy cleaning and pouring the grounds into the filter. The problem for me is that after about a month of use the bowl refuses to detach from the base, which removed much of the appeal of this product. I think this is a design flaw, as I exchanged my first one for a replacement, and now my second one is having the exact same problem."
2,Works great... for about 6 months,"I bought this for two reasons.I liked the design and my older Cuisinart, which still works, lasted for over 6 years.Now others have complained about the quality of the grind but this unit gave us no problems in that regard since I use a French Press. What's great about the cup design is that you can change cups for herbs or coffee.Unfortunately after using it once or twice a day for 6 months the operation became intermittent. Eventually no amount of probing and disassembly would bring it back to life.I realize this is a blade grinder but this was a cheap shortcut on Cuisinart's part. It's clear from the internal construction and other user comments that the product was manufactured to be disposable. I just wish I could have gotten at least a years worth of use beforehand."
1,It is just a short time to failure,"I just returned my second Cuisinart DCG-12BC Coffee Grinder, there will not be a third one. Both of the grinders lasted less than 6 uses. Each time the grinder failed I was almost done grinding. I did not take time to disassemble the unit but my assumption is that they have a faulty thermal limiter: the unit starts to heat up and the thermal limiter, a safe fuse, pops. Once the internal fuse shorts out it is back to the store or back to the manufacturer. I highly recommend you do not waste your time with this faulty product."
1,Avoid this grinder,The only thing that this grinder has going for it is looks. Soon after we bought our first one the cup could not be removed from the base. Then after owning it for a month or so the motor completely died. We took it back to the store and got a replacement. One week later the cup will again not come off the base. This time I'm going to go with a different brand.Did I also mention that it does a very mediocre job grinding the beans. After up to a minute of grinding there are still some whole beans left.
1,"Doesn't work, breaks easily","I bought two of these, one for coffee and one for spices, because I trusted Cuisinart products. Both broke in remarkably short order, and before they broke, grinding anything was an ordeal, involving repeatedly shaking the machine, stopping it to mix the contents up by hand and trying to fill it enough so that it would grind but not so much that it would spill over. (It leaks out of the bottom and the top of the grinding cup.) I would not recommend this product for anyone."
1,Crap,Got this as a gift- half way through grinding my 1st bag of coffee beans the motor burnt out. $30 for 1 use seems like a ripoff.
2,"Doesn't grind well, rusts and breaks down","I bought this grinder about 3 years ago.I am using it to grind coffee. The grinding is not even, and take long time to be fine enough for espresso.The lid gets dirty when you grind coffee, so you need to wash it every now and then. A few months after I bought it the screws of the lid started rusting. They are completely rusted by now.Later, the push button broke and shortly after got lost. I need to use a tooth pick to operate it.And finally, now I am no longer able to release the cup out of the grinder. It got stuck in there for good."
4,For the lay reader,"This book is easy to read and gives the lay reader many illuminating insights into the work of this well known and respected forensic psychologist. Above all, we catch a glimpse the human side of Elizabeth Loftus, who works not only out of professional commitment to good science and judicial process, but is also moved by her compassion and empathy for persons accused."
4,An enjoyable read,"I enjoyed this book, and didn't figure it out until the end. Unfortunately I don't speak French, so at places I felt a little lost. She didn't always translate what was said in French (maybe it was meant to be obvious, but I couldn't keep up) so I was left feeling like I missed something. But despite that, I still enjoyed seeing what kind of problems Faith could get herself in to, and thankfully out of as well. I look forward to reading the next in the series."
2,Tiresome Trip to France,"I was excited to take a trip with Faith Fairchild and her husband Tom to France but when I got there I was disappointed and longed to be back in Aleford, MA. I didn't like the story line of prostitutes and street-people. I took 5 years of French many years ago but it was tiresome to have to read all of the French phrases. I do like this series and in fact have given the books I've read 4 and 5 stars. Hopefully this won't be the first book in the series you read because every other book is so much better than this."
1,Reynolds or Wadsworth?,"As a supplement to the review above, please notethat this book includes a photograph of what is identifiedas a statue of John F. Reynolds. Although there are threebronze portrait statues of Reynolds at Gettysburg, thephotograph is one of the statue of Brigadier General JamesS. Wadsworth. Did the author actually visit the battlefield?"
2,Not Worth It,Unless you're planning on buying this book used I would not pay for it. The book didn't teach me anything that I didn't know already. There were a few good pointers in there but none worth purchasing and reading this entire book for.
2,Did not work with my hips,"Maybe it's my fault that this slip did not fit well. I have a small waist, but I have hips and a medium-sized butt. This slip continued to ride up and did not stay in place when I tried to wear it with dresses and skirts. It was very uncomfortable and I had to return it."
2,Poor quality,I expected much better quality from Creative's WebCam Go. The picture and video quality is poor. I had to immediatly upgrade the drivers because my Gateway Solo 2500 laptop would get a fatal error with the camera's USB plugged in at boot. The newest drivers on Creative's web site ocrrected the problem. I purchased 3Com's HomeConnect PC Digital Camera at the same time and the video quality of 3Com's cam was greatly superior for only $20.00 more. I've since return the WebCam Go and purchased a second 3Com cam.
1,I gave it back to the shop,"Experience was acceptable as long as it was connected to the computer. Pictures somewhat dark and no bright colors, but it worked.Then I took some off-line shots. Tried the photo series mode. Wanted to stop the series, so switched the camera off. It got a hang up. Connected it to the computer to store the pictures. Result: My computer crashed totally. Had to switch it off two times before Windows started again. From the help-line I got the procedure how to reset the camera. Some days later, the same thing happened again, but then the reset procedure didn't help any more.I think the camera comes with a hobby programer's software. It's awfull. I gave the camera back to the shop.Pros: Nice little webcam.Cons: No flash, no adapter for tripod, low quality pictures unless you have bright sunshine. Very buggy software."
2,Soft Carrying Case,"The case is custom made to fit the DSCT7 but it could never be considered ""soft"". It is absolutely rigid!"
3,book review,"The book that I received was the book that I wanted, but I was under the impression that it would be in better shape than it was, but other than that, it was great."
5,Rock the Halloween Costume!,These sandals were perfect for my Geisha Halloween outfit! It rocked ;) It wasn't as hard to walk in them as I thought it would be. thx!
1,Poor Quality,I was looking for a lightweight cover for indoor storage. The cover tore the first time it was put on the car. Due to the nature of the material it is virtually impossible to repair.Don't buy this cover. Spend a little more for a better quality cover.
3,"Some good, some just average information","I am torn on this book because I liked the first few chapters and found them simple to read and incorporate the ideas. I liked the theory of the ""right brain + left brain"" approach. I'm not new to SEO so I was able to move quickly through the work. The templates were helpful -- at first. But soon I found them cumbersome and not always worth the time I spent to put them together - especially when it came to key word selection. The industry is changing so fast the URLs were not always accurate anymore. The Wordtracker product they highly recommend i thought was a waste of my time - but it could just be the industry i'm in. So try this book if you are new to SEO - it won't hurt and may help."
2,Poorly Organized,"I must admit that there may be some really helpful items hidden in this book, but it is just so fluffy and disorganized that it is impossible to read. I have a more linear and logical approach to this sort of thing, so maybe it will appeal to other readers. But for me, there was little helpful information and a woefully small amount of pith buried in an avalanche of words. It seems like it is trying to form a new scheme every 10 pages.Really not a publication-level job of writing."
4,Good book,Good book if you want to learn about Search Engine Optimization and have little or no experience in this space. Well written and easy to follow.
2,Incorrect cold temp,"Trying this out in January in Ohio is a true test. The temps were down to the single digits, however, this therometer never went below 20, giving a very false reading. Expensive, good looking, easy to read, too bad it is inaccurate."
1,Poached eggs that look like an eye,"The machine looks stylish and sleek but it has serious flaws. One is dangerous- when you remove a just cooked egg (or eggs), the little handles beneath the lid expose your fingers to live steam. The other problem is funny, that the poached egg cups form the egg into the shape of an EYE! That eye with the yolk in the middle looks right up at you. Not what you want to see on your toast!"
2,Not if you want poached eggs,"This egg cooker makes perfect hard boiled eggs. However, the poached eggs are either too hard or too runny. If you use the recommended amount of water, the eggs are really runny and don't hold shape. If you increase the amount of water, the eggs become too hard. If you want poached eggs, buy the Oster appliance. (I used it for years until the teflon flaked off.) It's cheaper and it works really well for both poached and hard boiled eggs."
1,Disappointing Poacher,"I purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs. I used large, farm-fresh eggs. Whatever combination of water and timing I tried, I never got a perfectly cooked poached egg. The Cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout - specifically page 5. I called Cuisinart and after much back and forth, it was determined the eggs I used were too large and the directions were for MEDIUM-sized eggs. If considering this machine, be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat."
4,nice 4 price,This is a very simple design. It works as long as you adjust the water levels to work for the style of egg your cooking. I like this unit but know that it will not last years because of the plastic materials used for the insets etc.
3,Good but not after constant use,"I really really loved this egg cooker and it lasted me for about a year. The middle plastic piece that holds the eggs started to warp from the heat, causing water to leak all over every time I use it since it didn't hold the steam in. Time to look for a new one!"
2,Poor Quality,I purchased this because of the Cuisinart name. Big mistake.The very first time I used it the egg tray warped and is now cup shaped.It did a good job of cooking the eggs but now they are difficult to balance on the tray.
1,Not so great egg cooker,"I bought this one to replace an old Oster egg cooker I received when I first got married. It lasted me over 20 years. I love hard boiled eggs and make them quite often to put in various recipes. I thought the design was cute, and it looked nice on the counter. However, it leaks. Doesn't matter how much liquid is in it, it leaks. So I have to place a towel under it. Also, there is an odor that comes from it after the eggs have cooked. I'm going to buy another Oster. What a disappointment."
1,Good looks poor performance,"The design looks great. It does a wonderful job of hard boiling eggs. Don't even attempt to poach eggs, however. The plastic holder used for poaching eggs is so thick and heat resistant that the bottom of the eggs stay raw while the tops get overdone.I bought mine a few weeks ago and just threw it away."
2,Disappointed,"I am normally a big fan of Cuisinart. I had one of their coffee makers that lasted me for years and performed very well. There are two significant flaws with this device, which is why its going back. 1) The lid doesnt lock in place. There isnt a notch or groove so the lid says on tight. Instead, you have to align it. Not a show stopper but really disappointing. 2) The poached egg settings did not work for me. I followed the directions perfectly and they came out way over cooked (like 80% of the yoke was cooked). So i tried another batch and tried to guess. This time, they were too watery. This is too much of a hassle for what i am looking for. I want something that makes perfect eggs every single time and is Romper Room easy to use. This isn't the product."
5,Second time buyer,"I previously bought this item four years ago. When it started to leak water I researched on-line for a replacement. Guess what I purchased the same one again. Loved it then and love it now. The item gets used by the whole family. The design is easy to use, clean up and store. The only thing you must do is not have it under a cabinet when cooking since the steam comes out the top. We do hard boiled and soft boiled and even Easter eggs."
5,Great Eggs,"I have owned my egg cooker for about a year and it was actually a replacement for one that I used so much I finally wore it out. I have read a few reviews from people who said it makes a mess inside and out (egg exploding & water leaking). First of all, the piercer that comes with it on the end of the water measuring cup is to actually PIERCE the egg on one end so the pressure inside does not cause it to burst and leak out all over the inside of the cooker. Didn't you ever wonder what the needle was for? Or read about it? Second of all, the water leakage is more than likely due to a factory defect. Mine has been working leak free for a year, but my old one did start to leak after many years of usage.I highly recommend this egg cooker. Not only will you eat more eggs, but you will enjoy cooking them too! I boil a batch on the weekend and have them to snack on all week. Enjoy those eggs!"
1,mushy mushy mushy,I unfortunately didn't do my research before I bought this egg cooker. It takes too long to cook hard eggs and it's unreliable. Forget poached eggs. I've used this to make eggs benedict 4 times and each time the eggs have collected the moisture from inside and the whites are watery and runny and the yoke is cooked. I will be throwing it away and looking for a 5 star cooker.
1,Waste of Money,It took hours to setup and load. When it was finished I still had the Standard Edition and NOT the Premium Version.NO SQL Server 2000!What a waste of money and time!
5,The audio version of this book as narrated by Ron Perlman.,"The audio version of Tad William's book as narrated by Ron Perlman (of television's ""Beauty and the Beast"") is absolutely wonderful. The tale is told, for the most part, in Cailban's ""voice."" Ron Perlman gives Caliban the same sort of realism and pathos that he gave to his television role. William's Caliban, however, is no ""Vincent."" He has his own agenda to fulfill with Prospero's daughter 20 years after she has left the island. Mr. Perlman's voice is mezmerizing and he gives Caliban the perfect voice with which to tell his tale."
3,Lets really think about it?,"This was an absolutly exciting page turner. A great an easy novel which could have easily received 5 stars from me. However, do young 22 year old males drive porsches, ferraris, and lincoln navigators. You may be popular students; But come on, does every woman on campus want you and/or your other two BDP(Billion Dollar Playboys)friends? Can 3 men really when a fight against 10 other men regardless of their size? Does a fraternity of three, really have the bigggest parties on campus? Can a student graduate on time while not attending a single class for the semester? An finally, can a graduation speech make EVERY student run and hug their parents in the MIDDLE of the ceremony? While reading this novel you may come across many other things that will make you say ""GET REAL!""Although this was very good drama filled page turner, the author just took his ideal image of himself(the author his writing of himself in college) alittle too far. With that said, ITS STILL A MUST BUY!"
1,Humor (?) at it's worst,"If the funniest moments you can recall were spent telling jokes on a grade school playground-you just might enjoy this show--however if you prefer real British Humor--such as Fawlty Towers, Black Adder, Father Ted etc--stay far away from this poorly written and poorly acted attempt at comedy. At best--this is a less subtle ""Hogans Heros""--and that's being as polite as I can be. Personally, I had never seen this show--and purchased it because of the glowing customer reviews--with high expectations--and totally unsatisfactory results. Purchase this dvd if you choose--but you've been warned! (You're money could be far better spent on the other shows I mentioned-as well as Vicar of Dibley, Monarch of the Glen, Keeping Up Appearances, BallykissAngel, Yes Minister--or many other much more worthy comedies that are actually funny)"
4,A Funny WWII???,"One might not think it's possible to see WWII in this light...however...in England anything is possible!One of the best Britcoms lies in this story-line. I highly recommend it. The series starts off rather slow and these episodes are not of the funniest of the series BUT it is a must see as a preliminary to the rest of remaining episodes. One can only imagine what all these women find attractive in the man called Rene', yet they all seemingly fall under his spell. As the show goes on, each character grows more intense, more alluring, and more hillarious. YOU WILL BECOME ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW! Buy it. It's worth it."
3,An ok single,"I have this single and its ok.The regular version has a nice pop feel.They got top notch remixers Soul Solution to remix the track.But this is not there best remix work.And I have a lot of Soul Solution remixes in my collection!They also got Cibola(Where have they been?),to do a remix!Thet kept to there some funkt street beat like always.They should have gotten Thunderpuss 2000 to do a remix for the track.But I still know Soul Solution could have done a better job.Hex Hector did a great remix of there first single I need to Know!"
1,full of mistakes,"I have only watched the first of the 21 lessons on this 10 hour dvd, but during that one lesson my third grade son picked up on 6 mistakes! The first word that the teacher prints on the white board is misspelled - he spells ""natural"" as ""natual"". Mistakes range from ""7/3 = 6.7"" and ""2 > 3"" to more theoretical ones. I do think that my son learned something from the first lesson, but only because I was present to correct the mistakes and laugh with him about them. I would not recommend this dvd, especially if you don't intend to watch it with your child."
5,Salvation for the math-illiterate!,"Just what I needed...clear, step-by-step instruction. Its hard to find a school teacher with these qualities!"
5,Number 1 on my list of back to school items!,"I bought this DVD for my daughter a few weeks before school started. She has already watched most of the DVD and for a change is actually looking forward to the school year. It has really lowered her anxiety level about the dreaded subject ""algebra"". Recommend to all!"
4,Scared to death of Algebra?,"Having been out of school for more years than I can remember the one thingthat frightened me the most was Algebra. I was horrible in this subject in school. Even with a tutor I got a D in Algebra 1 and 2. It never made any sense to me, but that is rapidly changing now. I am able to understand it better as it was presented in a very clear and concise way. Jason is a wonderful teacher and even shows a side that we all make mistakes as we are human, but to be able to recognize the mistake and fix it made me even more comfortable. I am rapidly solving problems on my own now and send many thanks for this and all of your wonderful products!There is a companion workbook to this as well which I have ordered to practice my skills even further...great idea!"
4,The Math Video Tutor,"The video is good each topic is explained clearly and precisely. I like the fact that each section is individualized. The subject matter flows well into the next topic. The layout allows the student to select and work according to her needs.In the first lesson, the word ""natural"" is misspelled."
5,He's the greatest algebra instructor in the universe!,"Going back to school at 38 is not easy and I was assigned 40 problems in Elementary algebra that I COULD NOT work! I found this DVD & now LIFE IS GOOD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!"
3,Doesn't keep on ticking!,"I paid $3800 for a new Seamaster Limited Edition chronometer which will not keep time if removed from my wrist for more than 8 hours. The retailers' watch repairman has made two internal adjustments to no avail. A Timex keeps better time. In addition, none of the watch identification and documentation matched. Omega is overrated."
3,Archive Recording of Ancient Finnish Songs,"This rare recording is not for the casual listener, but is of particular interest to serious students of ancient Finnish culture and folklore. The recordings of several soloists and groups dating from the early 1900's(on wax cylinders) up to fairly recent times comprise the collection of songs. The sound quality varies considerably depending on the time of the original recording, but they probably represent the old chanting style of primitive song/poem singers as authentically as possible. No instruments accompany the singers."
3,He could have told MORE,"Living with Joe for five months was an experience to say the least. But there was SO much more that he could have written about. I think it's still a strong possibility that more books are on the way. Isn't that right, Joey P.?"
4,"Great ""behind the scenes"" look at MTV's ""The Real World""","Joe, a cast-member of the Miami episodes of ""The Real World"", gives his account about what ""really"" happened during the taping. This is an entertaining and surprisingly introspective view of what its like living with a bunch of strangers and having a camera pointed in your face for six months. This is a must-read for any fan of ""The Real World"", but especially if you've seen the Miami episodes and want to get the inside story."
4,Fun,This is a fun little product. Although I don't know if it is quite legal to have something like this sitting in your back window. But it works quite well. The only thing that would make it better would be a plug for home/work.
5,A jewel,"With a perfect blend of indie rock, electronic pop and some Latin beats, Sonora native, Jorge Leyva puts together his first album, a well crafted piece of work, with great graphics and an excellent self-production. Acoustic sounds are joined by electronic accents. The Orphan Monkey Meets The Acoustic Guitar is probably one of the best unknown albums of 2006. And if you're planning on buying it, do as Revolver, the last track on the album, says: ""No lo pienses más"" (Don't give it any more thought)."
2,Disappointment,"This workout disappointed me. The cadence of the workout was varying speeds (many times not matching the music), the counts of repetitions were off more than once, and the energy level was quite low. I definitely had better workouts - Crunch pilates series. If you are interested, rent through Netflix, do not buy."
2,Don't waste your time or money!,"I purchased this DVD hoping it would help me lose the 20 lbs I needed to get off before my wedding - what a mistake. I'm not an ""exercise queen"" but this workout didn't really even get my heart rate up. I tried it several times just to be sure, but, no, it's true, this workout will not turn you into a ""buff"" bride - don't waste your money. I joined Curves instead and kicked off those pounds in 6 short months and have kept it off! Forget ridiculous workouts where you have to swish the gown and toss the bouquet to get a cardio workout. Give me a break!"
2,Eh... kind of a disappointment,"I was unfortunately very disappointed with this workout, if you can even call it that. It was very elementary and the product description should warn buyers of that. All three segments are very short and not very concentrated. I definitely don't see myself shedding many pounds or toning up much with this one. I think the book is much better!"
4,Another version,"As someone who has been a Mode fan since they started and has followed them for the last 20 years I'd have to recommend this as a good example of early Mode live. Now that I live in the US I was dismayed to find that the NTSC US version leaves quite a few tracks out that are present on the European PAL version - including Shout, New Life, Leave In Silence - a bit puzzling but perhaps because the makers considered these tracks too unknown for US audiences? A great pity but at least they left Photographic which was always a good live track. If any of you fellow North American ""moders"" can get a copy of the European version, do so, then get it coverted to US format - you won't regret it if you're into the early stuff."
4,"Not the greatest performance, but a must for die-hard fans!","This is a recording of a live performance in Hamburg, Germany in 1984 or 1985. The sound quality isn't the greatest, but a good video for those who love DM's earlier songs. Songs include: 1. Something to Do, 2. If You Want, 3. People Are People, 4. Somebody, 5. Lie to Me, 6. Blasphemous Rumours, 7. Told You So, 8. Master and Servant, 9. Everything Counts, 10. Just Can't Get Enough...'Photographic' is also on the tape, for some reason it was left off the song list on the box..."
3,Good enough,"Not as good as many Hiaasen books I've read -- but I noted the pub date, it may simply be dated."
5,Ah ha!,"More Episodes.....give us more. The water of life. I have looked for spiritual wisdom that really fit all my life. This is it for me, and I am so glad for all that I encountered on the way here as it prepared me either through knowing what I don't want, or helping me to line up with this message by giving me similarities piece by piece. I am so grateful to be alive in this time of now."
4,Snuggle meter,"This Thermometer is the first thing I look at in the morning. It was intended to mount just outside my window, the ""arm"" that came with it was not long enough to extend past the window casing so my very-handy-significant-other fashioned another one out of a metal rod. It is very easy to read and is spot-on. I love knowing what to wear for my daily walks and knowing when to stay in snuggled in my favorite blankie."
3,Size,Good quality but smaller than I expected and setting right temperature on the back of dial was difficult
3,If you know nothing about eBay this is great,If you are fresh off of the boat and just discovered that eBay may permit you to cash out on some of your own stuff this book is great. If you think you will replace your current income by becoming an eBAy seller...don't quit your day job...yet. Although this book has information that can assist in helping the new eBayer it offers nothing new for the experienced seller. If you are new get this book if not don't.
2,Audio book reader ruins the book,"Okay maybe Im shallow minded or something and I know the book is read by the author...but the author who reads the audio book slurs his s's so consistantly its a major distraction...I couldnt equalize it out either.Every time I tried to put myself in the book his shushing his s's was a snap out of the story. For me it just ruined it, I tried I really did.If I had time to read a written copy Id maybe read it, but I dont.I wish they'd of hired a professional orator."
1,Loser,This is a low-budget amateurish nudie with no class. The girls look as if they'd rather be anywhere else. There is no direction for them either and they move around like they're in slow motion. The camera angles are no big deal at all.
3,"Great-looking ladies, but lethargic","I've got a lot of Peach videos, and they do some great ones, but I don't think this is one of them. All the ladies on it are great-looking, but it's all just too lethargic and most of the scenes are too similar to each other. The ladies are in country or western looking settings usually - farms, deserts, rural areas, and so on - but are always slowly stripping with little variation. And some are filmed to be very, very slow - I don't know who would want to see them that way! However, there ARE some very good segments too. One segment of a woman in a rural building is particularly artistic, and she's really sexy too! And several segments have 3 different views you can choose, a nice feature that many Peach videos have. The music is pretty strange - kind of a bland, elevator music. To sum it up, there's sexy ladies and some good scenes here, but overall it's just too letharic and unimaginative."
5,"Tall, Dark, and Chicano hilarious",Love george lopez very talented actor very funny good sense of humor would love to go to one of his show and would recommend this dvd to anybody who has a good sense of humor
1,Doesn't do a thing!,I have mice in my garage. Plugging this thing in and after weeks of being in the wall it's done nothing. I still see them when I go out there at night. Waste of money. Don't bother.
1,Mice eat and walk fine right bellow them,Ì don't know if I should laugh. They are working and making their noise and mice just walk by totally unconcerned. This item is good for nothing. A waste of money
3,Select or solid?,"I was recently given the opportunity to play a left handed OM40 mandolin by one of my students. I have to admit I had not heard of this manufacturer before this occasion, it is not common in the UK. If it were about looks and finish then I would give the OM40 a 5 star rating, but upon closer inspection I noticed what is described as a select spruce front is in fact a laminated select spruce front not a solid select spruce front. As such the mandolin played quietly with an unresponsive thin sound which was disappointing given the good overall finish. The price does seem to reflect the quality of the instrument which I would recommend to a beginner/intermediate level player. Only three stars because of the poor sound. I should give an extra star to the manufacturer for actually producing a lefty mandolin but as this review is attached to the standard version I won't. Could pick up an A style with a bigger and better sound for similar price."
2,"Great concept, doesn't work tho","I bought the seveth generation wipes because I try to keep chemicals away from my children, however these wipes are so dry that they do not clean at all. I had to use a ton to get my daughters bum clean and she ended up being red from all the rubbing. I am going back to huggies."
3,just ok,i got these once when earths best were out of stock and i was looking to safe some money. overall I do not think I saved any because i had to use twice as much. Earths best are still the best and worth the extra money.
5,"Great product, awesome value","We love these wipes. They are the perfect size, moistness, and are free of harsh chemicals. We used to purchase them at Babies R US but they are more expensive there. Now we only buy them from Amazon."
3,Love the wipes but...,"I love these wipes. What I hate about my most recent purchase however is the fact that the company changed the packaging and started packing 70 instead of 80 wipes per bag, yet selling them at the same price. Amazon did not alert me of this change (I have a subscription, so shipping is automatic) and I was mad to find out that I am receiving about 200 fewer wipes this time."
1,Terrible wipes,"I rarely write reviews but had to write one for these wipes. They are completely inadequate, each square is much too small and the wipes are not nearly moist enough. I will not be purchasing them again and would not recommend."
1,Needs Improving,"We buy everything 7th generation and love the diapers. But these wipes in the box are impossible to get out and they are dry. They are thick enough and good with poops only if I wet them first. I am very surprised to find such a fundamental design flaw with the box as all other wipes seem to have figured this out. Also, the company needs to provide a better supply of refills to Amazon. It's ridiculous that you cannot count on having them available. At this printing they were not available. We may have to switch back to Tushies. At least I can get them out of the box and find refills."
2,Not crazy about these wipes,"I bought these wipes hoping to like them since they are pretty easy to find everywhere. Unfortunately this was not the case. They are really thin, dry, and small! It takes so many of these wipes to clean up a poop! I much prefer Earth's Best wipes over Seventh Generation."
2,Wipes were dry and very thin,These wipes were very dry and thin when they arrived i would not recommend this product to anyone looking the pampers thick wipes are much better
2,Wimpy wipes,"Odd scent, small and wimpy wipes. For poopy diapers you'll need at least three. Love 7th Generation diapers, but moving on from the wipes."
4,Best of the ones we've tried.,"We have a new baby, which means lots of mess. These are the best free-type wipes we've used so far. They are thick enough that I am able to use one less on a ""#1"" cleanup and usually two less on a ""#2."" We haven't had any rash or reaction issues to these and it's nice to use less as that exposes him to less ingredients. They also seem to have a good amount of liquid, even when we leave the wipe warmer cap open between uses the exposed wipe is still moist. They don't leave him excessively wet either, which may have helped him resolve a bit of diaper rash (coincident with a diaper brand switch). They could always be cheaper, but subscribe and save helps with that."
2,"Hoping for better, funny smell","I am not sure if I got a funky batch or what, but there is a very strange smell with these wipes. Plus they are very dry and don't seem to be very gentle on my baby's bottom. He has been suffering more from diaper rash after switching to these wipes because of having to wipe more vigorously than with other brands. While I am all about them being chlorine free, they just don't work well for us. I have had bad luck with the diapers and also the wipes of Seventh Generation."
5,Seventh Generation Baby Wipes,"I love these wipes. They have a great smell to them and don't feel greasy or heavy like other wipes. Use them for everything from diaper changes, to face cleanings, to table cleaning. Would highly recommend!!!!Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes, 350 Unscented Wipes"
4,Very Good Wipe but not perfect,"These were the first ""eco"" wipes I used and after reading some of the more negative reviews I was a bit nervous.I have previously used huggies, pampers sensitive and my favorite pampers swipers. I do think that these wipes are good. They aren't too scratchy. They don't tear. They aren't too thin. They get the job done.I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old both still in diapers so I use them frequently. I absolutley loved the pampers swipers-until I found out they had awful chemicals on them-which made me switch to these.Compared to Pampers Swipers they are a TINY bit thinner and not quite as soft but they're okay.I do like them a lot better compared to pampers sensitive, these are more durable.While not nearly as thick as the huggies, they are quite a bit softer.4 Stars because I wish they were as soft and thick as the Swipers but to me the trade off is better to avoid the chemicals."
2,Not enough Liquid,"We wanted to buy these for a softer option for our babies bum as she tends to get diaper rashes easily every so often.So we tried them but were disappointed as there seemed to be a shortage of liquid on the wipe and it just seemed like they dried out very quickly. This made them almost unusable.We ordered two different shipments even, with the same result.We ended up getting ""everything-free"" generic brand wipes from our local warehouse shopping store with great results"
3,not best seventh gen. product,"I buy a lot of seventh generation products because they are safer and good quality. I really dont like these wipes though. I give them three stars since they are much better for the skin but they are a little too thin and not wet enough. I guess if they do the the job for you stick with them but we just prefer the thicker wetted wipes. Im not usually that picky about these things but wipes are to important to skimp on in my opinion. I use the diapers but I like the pampers sensitive wipes, they seem to be the best and not as bad as the regular wipes"
3,definitely NOT unscented,"I wouldn't order a large quantity of these unless you have smelled them first. They are NOT unscented. If I could describe the smell, I would say a lime popcicle smell. NOT odorless."
2,Too small,"I'm a big fan of the Seventh Generation diapers but was highly disappointed in the wipes. They were way too small to be effective. They were also paper-thin. As much as I like them being more natural, I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Sponsored by Lorax = higher price - Used to be better & less money,"When we first started getting these were a great deal and were fine for our son. The changes in packaging & size didn't get us upset (except when they removed the indicator as to which side you should pull the tab from). Recently they started putting a ""approved by the Lorax"" on the packaging. Apparently this is justification for a 50% increase in price! Subscribe & save went from $22-$31 for the same size pack. Time to try some alternatives - 1st stop Pampers Sensitive!"
4,Love these wipes...but a $10 price increase?!?!?!,I have loved these wipes since I began using them right after our first baby was born. But now just 6 months later they suddenly jumped in price over $10!!! Why the stiff price increase? I'm so disappointed especially since it seems as though it is a common practice for this brand to use deceptive sales practices including decreasing the size of their product and changing the ingredients. I really want to use the healthiest products for my baby and the planet but I can't go broke doing so.
4,my baby never had a rash,"I used these since my son was born. He never had a rash or whatsoever. Never used anything else so I cannot compare, but I think these are pretty good wipes. And I get good price with subscribe and safe."
5,THE BEST wipes!!,"they are the perfect thickness and I love that they aren't all connected together for when you have only 1 free hand (and then all of a sudden end up with 10 wipes stuck together when you only need 1 or 2). we use them not just for changing diapers, but for wiping dirty fingers and faces after mealtime. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!"
1,Honest Co vs Seventh Generation (old and new),"Well when I placed the order I did not realize that these were an older version of SG wipes... Ugh! These are horrible. They are dry, thin, not very absorbent and seem to have a rough texture. I have tried the new ones when I ran out of the Honest Co. wipes that are home delivered. The NEW SG wipes were good. These old SG wipes I ordered from Amazon were cheaper than Honest Co. for just wipes. Hence, why I bought these in bulk as my back up (remember, not knowing they were different than what I bought last week at my grocery store). Bad idea. I like the Honest Co. wipes better, and will just order more of them. These are so harsh, I may just donate these."
2,They don't clean well,"I liked the natural ingredients, but my shipment was not as moist as most wipes, and the kids let me know they didn't like them. I also needed more wipes than usual, which makes them much more expensive."
2,Will not buy again,"I bought these because they have a low quantity of preservative/artificial type ingredients and they are made of a lot of recycled material (packaging too)and are easier for travel than our normal cloth wipes and diapers. However, I will not buy them again. They are tiny, thin and I cannot stand the way they smell. I had to use lots to get a good clean bum on my son (and I wipe and fold to get the most out of each wipe) and I dreaded diaper changed because the way they smell.If you're looking for an excellent wipe, I like Huggies Natural Care or Costcos wipes. If you're looking for an environmental solutions, go cloth (economical too)."
4,Very good wipes for the lack of chemicals in this product,"I've tried a lot of wipes, with both toxins such as Propylene Glycol and toxic free. These are the best I have found that are toxic and chlorine free and DONT contain Propylene Glycol, a very toxic chemical found in most wipes and a lot of beauty products. I wish they were a bit damper and bigger, but would prefer these over most wipes that have toxins."
5,Good for sensitive skin,"This product is very good. Our new born son got a pretty bad diaper rash when we used other wipes because he has highly sensitive skin however the rashes disappeared within three days of switching the wipes to this brand. They however are a tad expensive, although I would not substitute price over quality so I am still happy. There is little to no perfume or smell in these wipes which are probably what makes it great for babies with sensitive skin like my boy's."
3,"wipes ok, packaging not so much","The wipes are just fine but the packaging is a pain. When you pull a wipe out, it partially pulls the next one out too (totally normal, just like any others) but there's only a little sticky flap to close the package. You have to stuff the next wipe back in with your finger& re-seal the package otherwise they will dry out. Not a huge deal I guess. We were just used to others with the plastic lid that you can click shut. I'm all for as many little conveniences as I can gather having a wiggly 6 month old!"
5,Best wipes we've used!,"When we had our son, we tried a bunch of different wipes out. I loved that these are green friendly and lack the harsh chemicals that other brands have in them. These are the only wipes we use and we love them!"
3,Smaller packages = not-so-earth-friendly but more $$ for CEO,"I'm bothered that 7th Generation is not holding true to their ""Earth-Friendly"" image in favor of corporate profits. They recently significantly decreased the value for this product by changing the number of wipes from 80 to 70. I've been using these wipes for a few years, and I like them well enough (although they do smell slightly odd). I think I'll switch to Earth's Best. 7th Gen also put fewer diapers (and made them smaller to boot--so I had to go a size up) in their size 3 diapers about a year ago. I used to think 7th Gen. was genuinely concerned about the environment, but like much of corporate America, is just a sell-out. What a disappointment."
5,When you want to be fresh ...,Great product. No testing on animals ever and no animal ingredients make this the right product to purchase. Plus great price when purchased in bulk.
5,Best for baby!,"I love these - our baby was allergic to all other wipes, even those that were for sensitive skin. These work wonderfully, and she has no problems with them!"
5,Cleans without that slimy feeling,"These wipes are somewhat dryer and rougher than Pampers, which to me is a good thing. They get things clean without leaving a slimy coating behind. We have been using them for months now with no episodes of diaper rash."
2,unpleasant smell,"this is my first box..I really don't like the smell....other than that, it's just regular wipes.. not going to order again.."
1,ecco-friendly...not,"With a reputation as being a ecco friendly diaper company you would think they would have thought about their wipes a bit more...Big plastic wipe holders that really tear and cut your fingers is not getting the job done...The amount of unused plastic that came delivered in an Amazon box was amazing...The wipe containers are half full, they could add more at least...the slot to get your wipe to come through is a product failure, very sharp and uncomfortable sticking fingers in as wipes dont always stick out for the ready take...need to rethink their strategy here...get rid of the big plastic box. If your going to use plastic to deliver the wipes then make it plastic sheet packaging that doesnt take up so much shipping space...oh and the wipes themselves are just ok...not buying again."
2,Disappointed,"I love Seventh Generation products, especially the baby care products. They ate environment friendly and usually work really well, but these wipes were disappointing. They are extremely thin, so it's me 3 times as many wipes to get my little one clean. They are very small and have a very strange smell to them. Also, she has had mild diaper rash since using these wipes, and they were the only thing that changed. I only gave them two stars since they are cruelty free and vegan. Will not be buying these again."
2,disappointed in the smaller count per package,I would normally give this product 5 stars but am disappointed in the decrease in wipe count while charging the same price. I switched to Earth's Best.
1,bad scent,"I had not used these wipes before and it was a mistake to order so many without trying first. might be better for the environment, but wow, they smell bad."
4,Good product,"These wipes are perfect, not too big and not too small. The only complaint I have is they always fall back into the container towards the end."
3,Non-flushable,"I wish Amazon had included the detail that these are non-flushable (made of Rayon). Unfortunate, since these appeared to meet my needs for non-allergic wipes. Three stars."
3,Dry in comparison,These wipes are a little dry for me. I seem to use more of these wipes then I did with other brands. I would not get these again back to pampers or huggies!
2,THey smell funny,I wanted to try them because they are better for Earth/baby but I just could not get past the smell. The strange odor lingered on anything it touched including baby. They are supposedto be unsented but that is not the case. Maybe you should go with a scent. Maybe that will mask the strange fishy/grass smell.
5,Best wipes for baby's bottom and the environment. Buy these!,"I love these wipes. I have tried many, many brands and my complaints are usually that they are either too rough or too dry to get the job done. These wipes are very soft yet strong. They don't contain a lot of nasty chemicals or harsh cleansers, yet they are effective at handling some major diaper messes. The individual packs with adhesive tape work adequately on their own, so you can toss a pack in the car, stroller, purse or anywhere else without having to worry about a big bulky plastic container. Cost used to be a concern, but with Amazon's Subscribe & Save program they are now really affordable. Since I know they don't have questionable ingredients I also use them to clean up my kids' messy faces after meals and their hands after playing outside. Overall, I really don't have any complaints about these wipes and highly recommend them."
2,Wouldn't buy again!,"These wipes are tiny!!! It takes several wipes to do the job, which is very wasteful! The wipes are also supposed to be unscented, but they do have a sweet smell to them. I definitely would not buy these wipes again."
2,"bad smell, not very green","I have a 6-month old baby and during my pregnancy I did a lot of research into green and eco-friendly, organic products. I ruled out 7th Gen for a variety of reasons (mostly the concealed chemical ingredients in them) but then I decided to give these wipes a try once the baby arrived. Needless to say, I won't be buying them again. They are drier than other wet wipes, so they tend to rub the baby's skin too hard w/o removing the impurities, they have a horrible smell (allegedly all natural but come on, we all know that doesn't mean it is pleasant) and that smell remains on baby's skin.. I am much happier with jackson Reese and will be going back to those wipes. Sorry 7th Gen."
4,but wait a minute!...,"I love the wipes and love that I can get them so cheap BUT...I can get 80 count tubs for CHEAPER than I can get 70 count refills from an earth friendly brand...it just doesn't quite make sense! I should think the refills would be more cost effective since they require SO much less to manufacture than the plastic tubs. I'm a little peeved. SO...I'm buying tubs again this time...more for my money is better for me at this point...I'll be sure to recycle. Hope that by the time I need to buy these again, the refills will be the better deal!"
5,Duncan is AMAZING,"I watched every single episode of The New Adventures of Zorro as a kid. I have them all taped except for about 20 episodes. And let me tell you, when I start watching them I cannot stop! Duncan Regehr is such a talented actor who puts so much into his roles. Yes, I was about 11 years old and I fell in love with the guy! The romance between Zorro and Victoria was so beautiful. The show had it all....and my favorite episode, ""An Affair to Remember."" I'll always be a Zorro fan!"
5,Buffs Moms Workout DVD,"I ordered Buffs Mom's to Be at the end of my first trimester and it has been great! I have had a very sick pregnancy, with severe vomiting and nausea, but couldn't stand not working out as I have always been an active person. I think that this workout is terrific to get some weight training in. A person might want to walk in addition to keep your heart rate up on the days you don't do the dvd or even on days you do depending on your fitness level. Overall though, I think that this dvd is very, very helpful and simple to do compared to some! :0)"
2,Pregnancy DVD doesn't deliver,"The title of the pregnancy DVD is enticing, but it doesn't deliver (no pun intended.) I had exercised quite a bit before I became pregnant and expected a more challenging workout. Unfortunately I allowed myself to get lazy and pulled this DVD out in my 3rd trimester when I was as big as a house and having sciatica. It seemed better then, but still not a challenge. The stretching segments are nice. I probably wouldn't buy this if I had to do over again. If you don't exercise much before you're pregnant this is a great DVD. It will at least get you up off the couch."
5,Scott O'grady is a pilot shot down in Bosnia that survives,I am really interested in milatary books aircraft anything I could get my hands on. When I started reading this book I loved. It was the best book I have ever read. I would incourage people of all ages to read this book. It has a lot of information about milatary.
4,This book is a true adventure story of an F-16 pilot,"Basher Five Two is the call sign for Scott O'Grady, who is the pilot shot down over Bosnia, in his F-16 fighter aircraft. This adventure is all about his survival while in the woods after being shot down. He survived with almost no water., and no food. This is his tale of survival throughout the worst 6 days of his life."
4,¿¿¿¿~~~???? cool book!!!,"This book is great, it has great details, O'Grady's strive to survive, made a great storie. He had to go through all kinds of obsticals including being hunted down by Bosnian troops. His will to survive let him get through all his obsticals. I recomend this book for people who likes adventure books. This book is almost like the movie ""Behing Enemy Lines"", so if you like that movie you should check this book out."
2,Kardio Krap,I was expecting a great mix to energize my cardio workout. Instead I got a flatline drone that was as dead as last call at a persian supper club. Howe does he make any $?
1,This program sucks,"I bought this thinking that it was going to be an ill program. And thats exactly what i got. a program that makes me sick. It is the slowest thing ever ( i have a brand new computer), The text is hard to read, and the tech support is not helpful at all. if i could rate this product out of 1 to 10. it would most likely be a -5.DONT BUY"
3,Brass outdoor thermometer,"The design and concept of this thermometer is great. We love the brass. However, we were looking for a large dial outdoor clock and were very disappointed at the size of this thermometer."
3,thermometer,"Works properly, but it arrived with a dent in the housing which appears to be not from shipping but from manufacturing--poor quality control."
4,Guide for Scottish golfing vacation,"My brother in law and I decided to travel to Scotland for a Golfing vacation. With only about two months advance notice, I ordered the book hoping to use it as a means for selecting good courses that would not cost a lot of money.The book devotes about a page to each course which are grouped by geographical region. The courses are rated and contain excerpts from reviews by other golfers. We played 7 of the courses in the book and found that the ratings were accurate. However, the green fee prices are out of date, with the courses averaging about 30% more than quoted in the book. Contact information is provided for each course and when a advance reservation is made, the course will tell you the rate.If this is your first trip to Scotland, then the book is a great way to get started and plan your trip. It does not focus on anything but the courses, so travel times, lodging and other sites to see are not covered in the book."
1,"Again, you get what you pay for...","The case I received wouldn't stay shut, so I emailed the seller and they sent a second unit. This one was somewhat better, had to use scotch tape so the case wouldn't pop open, used it for the weekend and went back to old 'skin'."
2,Not too bad; could be a lot better,"This book covers some of the ground of Brian Lavery's 'Nelson's Navy'. Lavery's book is much more comprehensive and much larger. O'Brian's book has some color plates, but it was really written to take advantage of his name. I'd buy Lavery's book first, or ""The Young Sea Officer's Sheet Anchor, or a Key to the Leading of Rigging and to Practical Seamanship"" by Darcy Lever (a contemporary book)."
3,An appendix packaged as a book,"While written in Mr. O'Brian's usual lucid style and accompanied by useful line drawings and full-color plates of paintings, the ""book"" is so thinly written that really only qualifies as an appendix to one of the Aubrey Maturin books.As an appendix packaged as a book, it offers only 91 pages of small paper size and large type. Perhaps it was meant to be a miniature ""coffee table"" item--to be bought as a present for others.Having now read nine of the Aubrey Maturin series and enjoyed them all, I have to say that this offering represents my only Patrick O'Brian experience in which I didn't get my money's worth."
4,"Pretty Good, But Not Great","The story line was great, and very interesting. The only problem was with Scully. First off, Scully was the one who came up with the supernatural idea, and then believed it all when Mulder added on. On the show, she's usually saying something like ""Why are we here Mulder?"" not ""This whole thing is a government conspiracy involving humans who can change their skin color."" (That's not actually a real quote, but it's pretty close to what she says.) Second, usually Scully in the show is attacked by the mutant, murderer, alien, government man, monster, curse, whatever. This time she was pretty safe the whole time. Mulder got into the most trouble. Also the cursing got on my nerves. Now for the good points. It was a very interesting story, with a shocking ending. The old woman was hilarious! I was always chuckling, especially with her spray paint. The book is also pretty creepy, and makes you keep looking out your window to make sure the 'Goblins' aren't out there."
2,"Well, at least the idea was right...","One thing I give this album credit for, is giving me more respect for Trent Reznor because after listening to this cd, it will become very obvious that not everyone can pull off a song like Trent can. It doesn't really add up for me, NIN is a amazing band (or man) and the bands they chose to be on this disc are great bands too (Switchblade, Sheep On drugs etc) yet the songs are really low grade. Pig tried to pull off a cover of ""Head Like A Hole"" and tried to make it all jazzy. I'm a huge fan of jazz and a huge fan of nin and I think Pig is a pretty decent band but it doesn't mix well at all. Overall I think this disc was probably something Trent thought was a great idea until he heard the finished product, and it's just another way for a lame label like Cleopatra to make more money."
2,Unreliable,"I sadly found many of the directions in the book to be incorrect which turned into long wasted hours on the trail - lost. With this kind of book, the authors should understand they have a responsibility to double check their material for accuracy."
2,"Dissapointed, but thorough...","We have used the book over this past summer and every trail we seem to do from it is dissapointing. Many of the trails have been more like walking in a city park than hiking in the wilderness and I doubt I'll actually buy the book (had it from the library to evaluate).The trails we did from the book also did not come close to how I would rate the scenery. We did 9 adn 10 trails and I would give them, at best, a 4 or 5. It certainly has lots of trails, so maybe we consistently choose the wrong ones, but I'm looking elsewhere."
5,Sales Done the Right Way!,"This book opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking at sales. Definitely recommended for any one who is serious about sales, and more importantly, making it big in sales!"
1,"very un-satisfied, un-happy, BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!","VERY! un-happy with this order. i give this a ""NO-STAR"" in my opinion because several months ago i ordered and PAYED for, not just one but two of these lights and never got them. not a huge loss, but still feel ""RIPPED OFF"" >:["
5,An essential book for any weaver,"Ten years ago the teacher of my introduction to weaving class recommended this book, but it seemed like too much to spend on a book that only covers warping. Now after years of irregular warp tension and other problems I have finally invested in it. It is full of revelations about how I could have prevented those errors and gives me the confidence to try more difficult yarns such as linen and handspun for warps. On the other hand it was a good thing to have some weaving experience before reading a whole book about warping - there are so many steps that I might never have gotten started if I had read this first. Now I can pick and choose the techniques that will improve the warping methods I have been using all these years.The techniques described are for jack looms with four or more shafts. The book doesn't cover warping rigid heddle or coutermarch looms."
1,Unrealistic and ridiculous,"This has to be the worst book I have read this year.I had read a couple of others that I liked by this author but this seems like something she threw together to satisfy a contractual obligation. Some of the characters are fine but the plot involves shallow explorations of way too many topics: parental kidnapping, sexual abuse, recovered memories, a love triangle, an illegitimate child, alcoholism, prison, methamphetamine manufacture, race relations, cancer, the idea of the Indian as ""noble savage,"" and some really absurd rap lyrics using slang that was dated five years ago. The time frame from the arrest of a main character to his trial seems to be no more than a couple of months, and he goes from a respectable older guy who runs a senior citizens rec center to a major player in a prison drug ring and murder. It's kind of like a Lifetime movie but worse."
4,Vanishing Acts,"Vanishing Acts tells the story of Delia, a woman whose life is turned upside down and inside out when her father is arrested for kidnapping, 28 years after the fact. Delia questions who she really is, and who her father really is. Having a young daughter herself, Delia cant ever imagine losing her child, but she also knows her father to be a good and loving man and therefore must have had a good reason for taking her.The story is told through many different views including Delia and her father's. Friendships, alcoholism, prison life and family are all part of this wonderful book. This was my first Jodi Picoult novel and I cant wait to read her others. A great 4.5 star book!"
1,"For those who found this book incredibly boring, I concur!","I'm glad it's not just me. This was one of the most tedious and frustrating novels I've ever read (or actually listened to via audiotape). Was it really necessary to share every event in this story from every character's point of view? I found myself longing to fast forward (not possible on my download) and ended up playing it while not listening, hoping desperately that at some point, SOMEthing would happen! And I swear there were points when, if I had to hear what a wondrous creature Delia is one more time, I'd scream. In fact, I DID scream and fortunately I was in my car and no one heard. I'm still not finished with it, and I fear my Ipod might just explode before I get to the end. Possibly, there IS no end. There are few books that I've found intolerable in my decades of reading, but this is one of them. A definite ""don't waste your time"" in my opinion."
3,Good Plot,"This book is about a mother finding out in adulthood that she was kidnapped by her own father. It has dozens of twists and turns and nothing ends as you would imagine it would.This was my first Jodi Picoult book. I was very intrigued from the very first sentence and could not put the book down until I found out the answers. It was not what I expected, though. I got a bit confused throughout, but all in all, it is worth the read.All of this author's books seem to be the same way, some better than others, but all of them will keep your attention."
3,"Love her work, but . . .","Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors and one of a handful of authors I buy in hardcover. Like another reviewer said, I find some of her work brilliant and some of it not as compelling. VANISHING ACTS falls into the latter category. I, too, felt the prison scenes were unnecessary and distracting. In fact, I skipped over most of them. Unfortunately, this story didn't have enough meat to sustain it, and I suspect that's why the prison scenes were included--simply to flesh it out. That said, even a less-than-wonderful Picoult novel is better than 90% of the fiction published today, certainly it's always better written."
1,Did not receive.,I've been asked to wait and wait for this book to be delivered...a snail could have delivered it faster than this service.
1,AGREED! These characters are boring and unlikeable...all of them.,"I work and know more interesting (and nicer) people than these characters, at least the ones that were believable. Also, there were many instances where the author should have done a little more research to make the whole thing credible. It's really sad when one of your favorite authors gets lazy and just puts out anything because the name sells, or maybe it's pressure to publish, I don't know. Her next book could be about a young author who feels pressured to get out another book but goes blank and publishes something bad. Vanishing Acts has left me with such a negative opinion that I probably won't read any more of her books."
4,suspense,"Good story. Made you think about taking sides when you don't know the whole story. The characters are easy to fall in love with. Jodi Picoult is dependable for a good read, always."
1,Disappointed,"Guess I should have listened to more selections from this CD before purchasing it. I was hoping for nice calm soothing flute music. Man this is really bad! I suppose it would be enjoyable if one was on acid. I can't decide whether to throw it away, or give it to someone I don't like! What a waste of money! My fault, I should have researched further."
1,Disappointing,This recording features someone speaking poetry as the music plays in the background. Nothing in the description or cd indicated this.
1,Poor sound quality.,Sound quality is unbearable. We had to turn it off after 15 minuts because we couldn't stand it anymore. Picture is grainy. They just slapped an old tape on a DVD and shipped it out.A real rip-off.
1,Rediculous,Saw them live and I almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard at how pathetic they were. Someone needs to tell them that disco died in 1978.
1,Not for Acura RSX 2002,"I bought these pads so I could change the brakes my self....and it doesn't fit. I didn't get my money back b/c by the time I figured out how to do my brakes, the return policy had expired."
1,Worthless,"I originally bought this product on Amazon, 6 weeks after shipping it still had not arrived so I cancelled the order and got a refund. Amazon was great about that and got me my refund almost instantly. A few weeks later I went to Besy Buy to get the same product, just tried to install it into my 2006 Xterra with a double din radio. This product does not work for a double din radio, sure there is a trim piece for it but that is it. It is cheap and does not look good. Also the screw holes on the trim piece do not line up with my Xterra, it has no screws on the sides of the air vents where the picture shows and where the trim would need to be connected. If you are buying this for a double din install think again."
3,Feel good Vacation music,"My wife met one of the singers from this group (Danny)at her workplace and he was very nice so we ordered this Cd out of curiosity and found a pleasent surprise. It is uplifting and feelgood music with smooth vocals that work well together. We played it on our way to Daytona Beach and it set the atmosphere for fun in the sun. Patches has always been one of may favorite oldies songs and was surprised to see that the General wrote it. If you like your ""beach music"" to be more soulful and more jamming than the Beach Boys then this CD is for you.Put it in on vacation and let the good times roll."
4,Not Originals,"Great group, in my opinion. Not easy finding all their US/UK hits on one CD. For being remakes, they are a lot better than most remakes!!!"
2,Not so waterproof,"I went swimming in the ocean with my car keys in the small pouch inside my board short pockets. Although the electric car opening button still worked when I got out, there was moisture that had accumulated inside the pouch, enough that a few drips came out when I opened it and turned it upside down. If I had swam for longer, my keys might not have worked. They should add ziplock zippers to the pouches to further waterproof them. Next time I will put one pouch inside another one and that should waterproof me, or I will have to buy another product."
2,Not worth the money,These tear incredibly quickly. By the end of a 16 day trip they were all unusable. For some reason the top Velcro area that's supposed to secure them tears off within the first few times you open the bags.
1,terrible-won't let me put in a zero,"THis is one of the worst products I have ever used, does nothing for the wrinkles, temporary or otherwise, but does make my skin peel like an AHA.I would like a refund or a credit on this. I keep thinking maybe it will get better-but soes absolutely nothing. Was this ever tested on anyone for results?Paula"
2,Not as expected,"I am always looking for the ""IT"" item to help as I get older. Unfortunately, this product is not as expected, nor as fabulous as advertised. Thick. Crow's feet were magnified - if that's even possible. I returned to the company and they were really easy to work with. I'm sure other products would be more beneficial."
2,This DVD is Whack,i was disappointted in T.D.D. I Thought this DVD was going to be better then what it was do not spend your money on this DVD
4,"Good product overall, no problems!","It was a good item. However, a little hard to operate at first and it had an issue in the beginning with reading the SD card."
5,A MUST MUST MUST have for any Otis fan. Brilliant!,"A must for any Otis fan....complete performances with editing done very well. Family & friend interviews....Cronological order of songs and explaination/interviews on each song. It is amazing! Tina Turner actually reccommended this to me, it was her inspiration and now mine! Thank you Otis, may you be at peace forever."
5,Birthday Gift For Dad,"My dad loves Otis's music, but he has barley ever seen him before, I knew he'd like it. He watches it all the time"
3,Touching but not enough of the good stuff,I am not the original Otis fan in the house but I have come to appreciate the music that he made. This documentary in my opinion didn't have enough of the main stream favorites. My expectation was something we could put on both to listen to and to watch if we chose. It seemed geared toward a true music junky and not the popular crowd.
3,Does the job,"This polish remover is no different, as far as I can tell, from any other polish remover. Does not seem to dry out my nails. Does what it is suppose to do."
2,The Fine Art of Love,I don't really know what else to say except strange and disturbing. Not at all was I was expecting. I don't recommend this for anyone.
4,Pleasant Surprise,From the first review I was prepared for the fact that I had wasted my money. But no. The Schumann Violin Concerto in D minor was really good. Very much like Brahms if not quite as good. In the hands of a real great soloist and conductor this could be a masterpiece. The soloist and conductor on this are good but not great. Still definately worth the listening. The other Concerto is Schumann's Cello Concerto arranged for violin. Ok but not much more.
4,The Dead Speak,"Edna Buchanan carries the characters from THE ICE MAIDEN forward to COLD CASE SQUAD. Old deaths that push their way into the present.A woman walks into a Miami police station claiming she has been seeing her husband all over town. The problem is he has been dead for twelve years of has he?Edan Buchanan has been keeping fans interested in the streets of Miami for a good while. This reader hopes she keeps up the pace.Nash Black, author whose books are now available on Amazon Kindle.HaintsWriting as a Small Business"
3,Scattered characterizations mar story,"Edna Buchanan has forsaken her long-time series star, crime reporter Britt Montero, to take the plunge with a McBain-like team of Miami cops, the Cold Case squad (also featured in ""The Ice Maiden""). Trouble is, she doesn't write like McBain. The view-shifting is sometimes awkward and Montero's insight, curiosity, impulsiveness and personal problems are parceled out to a crowd.Buchanan knows plots, though. Squad boss K.C. Riley sidelines a promising serial-killer investigation to re-examine an accidental burning death because of her own grief over the similar death of her faithless former lover (also Montero's former lover). A couple of active and increasingly desperate killers dodge a team of smart cops in an accelerating plot of twists and turns that never quite wriggles clear of the writing problems."
4,Good book if you don't want to go too deep into details,"The book is good because is a quick condensated way of looking at the animal world and it has good illustrations on 90% of it (only illustrations, no pictures) but it misses a lot of species of course and is bulky to handle when reading, that's why I take one star down but other than that is a good book."
4,No more dirty wheels!,I have installed these on my C320 Mercedes and 530i BMW and like them alot. They stop just fine and I don't have to clean my wheels every week.
5,The only book of it's kind...that I know of,"WOW!This book helped me turn a trunk full of parts and pieces (That I thought was junk) into a dozen Sets . The excellent photos and parts listings are very helpful when you need to know what exactly came with any given set. This book covers Cardboard and plastic structures and sets for barbie and all her friends and family, an excellent book for any collector."
3,Recipes and menus nearly impossible for a single person,"There is a lot of excellent information in the book, perhaps worth the price alone. However, I purchased it looking forward to having a month's worth of recipes and menus to follow. Most of the recipes are for 4 servings, some for 2. And the author admits they are nearly impossible to cut in half. Since we are told it is essential to follow the daily menus exactly to benefit from Whitaker's program, the book is nearly useless for a single person living alone.The book is a major disappointment."
1,It's a good fit!,The car cover is a great fit for our new hybrid car. I wish I have had it for my other car (now is old) 7 years ago.
3,70s & 60s,"The unltimate Classic's of 007's Sean Connery and Roger Moore: Dr. No, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Man With The Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me & Moonraker.Into classics, this is your choice...Into 007 library regardless of how old or new the movies are this is a must.Into 007 new ones, go for The James Bond Collection (1999)."
2,Greedy,The only reason why this set receives two stars is because of the packaging. I bought several 007 DVDs individualy and to complete the series I have to buy two box sets and obviously end up with several doublicate movies (among them Die another day)!!!Next time sell them as individual DVDs as well!
2,Not The 2nd Volume,"I ordered this collection used, so I knew I was taking a chance. However, I didn't anticipate that it wouldn't even include the DVDs that it should. Of the listed titles, only two were actually included in the set I was delivered (For Your Eyes Only, Moonraker). The remainder of the DVDs that were included were a combination of the movies from Volume 1 and Volume 2. This is purely a negative review of the seller, as they didn't deliver the DVDs as promised. I guess I've learned my lesson regarding the purchase of used items.Sad face."
3,Very inspiring,"The film is inspiring. It is full of intellegent words by artist you may of heard of, or never heard of; but will be glad you heard speak.The film is fun and light hearted - Comfortable in you living room type interviews.Some rough production aspects - but it will amke you want to be an artist"
2,Inspiring?,"I just watched that DVD. The message of the piece could be summed up thus:Just do it! Be an artist and create!So? What else is new? That DVD is not telling you anything about becoming an artist that you wouldn't already know. Okay, maybe Lydia Lunch (who's brilliant), when she mentions that we won't be able to create very much as long as we're into TV and the web etc. I better log off now!Don"
3,"Louvin Brothers, Weapon of prayer","A part of their Capitol 8-CDs integrale (Bear Family Records), for fans and family who prays."
3,"Nice book, but wish it was bigger!","I'm a preschool teacher and wanted an informational book for our unit on squirrels. This book fell short in a couple of ways- too small in size for a large group of children to see the pictures well, although the illustrations were quite nice, and not a whole lot of information about squirrels. The story was not all tht interesting- I had to elaborate on it to hold the interest of a group of 4 year olds."
1,Do not buy this item.,"The box was rusty. Yes , rusty. I am not even gonna mention about the cheapness of the product. Just got returned thanks to Amazon returning services."
4,Great Deal,"I couldn't find anything like this anywhere near this price point in local stores. I didn't much care for the blue in the photos but for the price I could not pass it up. However... I was pleasantly surprised when mine arrived because it was in fact black, not light blue. The only gripe I have about the product would be the tiny keys and their rough edges."
4,does the job but weak handle,"Handle looks and feels like it will fall off in too much weight, the latch has this problem too.. I have a lot of change that I carry in this and it is just used as a personal bank, the lock is very cheap but I have no need to lock it. I just hide it and it is safe. I only knocked one star because it does the job as described. I don't use it at any art stands or as a merchant."
3,expected it to be better,"Her ""How Sweet It Is"" CD is one of my favorites. On that release, she's in great voice, she covers great material and I think it was very bold to do a CD of all cover tunes. I was excited to find that Joan did a new 70's style CD, but I found that this disk to be just pleasant. It is also somewhat dull... no sparkle, no WOW, no ""hey you gotta hear this!"". I ain't bad, but if you're tempted, start with the ""Sweet"" CD."
4,Joan Osborne,"Breakfast In Bed is a different type of CD for Joan and though I miss the voice from Relish, I enjoyed this CD."
3,Quality Vocalist,This album was not exactly what I was hoping for but still is a very enjoyable music experience.
5,Great activities!,"This book is wonderful! I got it for my 7-year-old daughter, and she immediately sat down to work. This books takes kids from the basic idea of how gears work, through all the every day uses gears have. She absolutely loved the book!"
3,Utterly Confused!,"Now I have had correspondence, with people connected with this book, The picture of Jesse and his grandson ASTONISHES me to where I can actually see it may be him after plastic surgery.I do recommend reading the book,, only took me about 45 minutes to complete,,, it leaves you with a want for more, of course.I have loved his music and the man himself was very complex to the everyday eye. This may be true, But whatever true or Not. This Jesse is living a painful life from extensive physical abuse, ! I really feel it is about 85 % true, May be more. I think the year 2002 will reveal our wishes of knowing the exact truth. That is if EPE let's it be known. Why close a money maker. do you think EPE would want to lose all that money, they will lose if EP is really not gone??!??! I recommend you read and see for yourself. although it is truly disturbing to a real EP fanThanx"
5,Excellent,"If you are a fan of Barenaked Ladies, this DVD is for you!! It will feature 17 BNL videos along with 7 clips from a recent live show. It will also feature a hilarious commentary by the band and a ""One Week"" karoake singalong feature. I can't wait!!"
5,A good read for avid kitty readers,Nice book with easy to read font and great pictures. The story keeps them reading and the book is just the right size for bedtime.
3,Okay,This book was okay. Maybe because of the short stories. Would have loved for Nikki Turner's story to continue.
5,A Complex but Interesting Book,"This is a very ""wordy"" book about a complex man, his life, politics, and beliefs. It is not a history per se of Malcolm X, nor is it a biography, rather it is a collection of ideas within ideas about Malcolm X and what made him tick. I must warn you though it is not as easy book to read, but it rates five stars in my opinion because it attempts to be analytical and non-judgemental about the man and his times. Not an easy task when you are writing about someone as famous as Malcolm X. This is a good book to supplement Alex Haley's book on Malcolm X as it looks deeper into the man and what he stood for. Well worth reading if you have the time and patience."
2,ahh... the curse of puberty,"...and maybe it's just my musical tastes. I love the album. It's well worn in my car CD player. But now that I've seen the video, it shows that, like all great kid singers, puberty takes a large toll on voices. For a fan who is more moved by looks than the music, this video is great. But for me, it's like hearing the perfectness of the songs on the album flawed by the lowering of their voices. I'm not quite sure who is who in the band, but the kid who sings track 6 (next to last on the album) still has his voice. Also, I wish they would have put some back stage commentary on the video, not just a performance. So, mixed reviews. There are ways that boy bands (real boy bands, meaning the members are in low teens) can survive puberty. Hanson did it very well. The Moffats didn't. I hope that Dream Street can adapt their voices to new music without compromising their fans."
2,Not worth the money and time!,"OK, some of the moves are amazing, credit has got to be given to the players/showmen, but the DVD as a whole is definitely not worth the $18 and the time you'll spend watching it. For most of the footage is of the fans going crazy over the wild moves on the court, and off it, and the players fooling around in their tour bus! Some might enjoy it, but it certainly shouldn't be considered a Street basketball DVD, for true basketball only covers a small part of it! The whole DVD can actually be summed up in less than 10 minute, if all the BS was cut out."
4,"Great book, but many typo's...","I really enjoyed the book, it is exactly as described. I found it well written, funny, and helpful. I got it for myself as well as my kids, to help improve our writing.The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the Kindel edition that I purchased has many typos (mostly extra spaces inside words)."
2,Easy Spirit not up to par,I had assumed that these Easy Spirit shoes would be on a par with with other Easy Spirit shoes but they fit strange and are not very comfortable.
4,"Good Features, Good Value","We moved recently and our old, reliable Radio Shack answering machine/phone didn't survive the move. So we found and bought the Panasonic 2357 and for the most part are happy with it. Other reviewers have covered the key operational points well, so I'm just chiming in to say that battery life looks to be good thus far and audio quality is very good to excellent. I like the features and the layout. The handset is a little bit slippery and on longer calls, my thumb gravitates towards the rubber cover that blocks the headset plug hole to get a better grip. Range is excellent and the talking caller ID is useful."
2,A mix of other music by Nouvelle Vague,"When I saw this i took a chance. It was mixed music by other artist. it had some great songs but it is not my favorite. I would pass, and i love nouvelle vague and would buy any cd that they would sing. this mix didnt do it for me. my fiance loved it and said there are some good songs. well, I would rather listen to the real deal. Peace out!"
2,Buyers Beware: Could have been packed better!,Arrived in several pieces. Couldn't even try to fit it on my phone.
4,good peice,This part is as advertised . The DVD mount is solid enough to use a large personal DVD player and hold it well.
2,Unsafe car mount,I just got this mount to mount it on my Honda Odyssey. First the arms needto be fully extended to attach to the headrest poles. Once in plact it totally obstructs the rear view of the driver. Hence in my opinion it is not safe to drive with this mount installed. I am planning to return this item after I get from vacation
2,Product Good - Seller not so good,"The Seller of this product took almost 3 weeks to deliver the product. These days, who wants to wait that long for delivery. Were they making it from scratch. This is the main reason I give this product a low rating, other than that, I think it is an okay product."
2,Did,Is a great idea but if both front seats are placed the same way. I am to short and when driving the passenger seat next to me won't be at the same level
3,Works fine but with 2 flaws,"The product mounts your DVD between your 2 front seats, although it may work for you, I found 2 major issues:1) It completely blocks your rear view window2) In case of some type of accident, I can see this DVD flying either forward or backwards towards the kidsI would not recommend."
3,Portable DVD Player car mount,"The DVD Player mount works. My little guy loves it. He had been kicking prious DVD holders, since they hang real low with multiple straps. My worry is that it is a little flimsy looking and what will happen if we are in a wreck. All has been good so far."
3,algo facil para leer en castilliano,"Como estudiante de castilliano, yo encontre este libro bastante facil a leer y comprender. Tambien, la experiencia ha mejorado mi vocabulario con muchas palabras desconocidos, por ejemplo: boludo, romper las bolas, te la meto, y barbaro. Ahora estoy mucho mas educado."
2,Someone forgot part of the interview,"I've used TurboTax for several years. This year there were several errors in filling out my schedule C (particularly in regard to employee costs) and 1040 Schedule B. I used a full walk through interview. On the first pass I supposedly owed $99,800 (in addition to estimated taxes already paid). I double checked each interview step, then abandoned the effort and went to ""Forms"" where I found several errors and missing entries. End result: $434 still owing. Now I wonder how many deductions were lost in previous years!"
5,turbo tax software,I have used this product before and was very easy to use and self explanatory with helpful steps all throughout.
4,Works as expected.....,"Turbo Tax made compliling,reviewing and filing my return very easy. It asked all of the necessary questions, gave me the information I needed to make decisions and was ver straight forward."
4,insufficient menus,"Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered.To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same."
2,couldn't handle employee discounted stock sale,"I've done my own taxes with TurboTax for several years. This year, I sold some company stock that was discounted through a somewhat complicated system (15% off of the lower of the first day of the offering period, or the day of the actual purchase, twice monthly, whichever was lower). I had all the information from the purchases, but could not get TurboTax to correctly compute the cost basis. So, I will have an accountant prepare my taxes this year."
1,Did not include all forms,I purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so I had to buy another version from them. H&R TaxCut included all I needed and was 1/2 the price.
4,Very Good book for general information,"This book covers almost all of the basics of HTML design, ranging from how HTML works to how to design a good web site. It also encourages good habits"
4,Good alternative to an expensive Palm cradle,"Works great and is accompanied by a seperate cable to be used in your car or any 12 volt (lighter) outlet. Although not as sturdy as the ""genuine"" Palm cradle, it is a much more economical alternative to the one sold by Palm. I have used it almost daily and am very pleased with its performance. If there is one minor negative it is merely that the unit is very light and I found that fastening to my desk with Velcro kept it from falling off."
2,"Does the job, but.....","Good idea, VERY good price but...I just purcahsed my palm t5 and wanted the cradle to dock the unit during sync operations. The advantage was it would also charge while sitting in the cradle.The problem is the design doesn't allow the pda to be connected while it is in it's protective case."
3,Understanding why you do it is the important step in Social Work,"I am late reviewing this item. I needed to build up my book base for my Social Work degree. I needed to underastand more on why we practice social work, assessing and planning. This book helps you to understand the why's and the how's. The book covered many my needs,helped me with my finals. It is a good book. You can reveiw it before buying to see if it will meat your needs. :-)"
3,Doesn't like my Toyota's CD Player,"These are good CDs, just be aware that if you own a Toyota (mine is a 2001 Camry) that The factory installed CD Player doesn't like to read these. I was able to get my burned CD to play, but only after 10-15 minutes of trying and countless disc read errors. After I did get it play, there were long delays between tracks."
5,espresso steaming/frothing pitcher,This 10oz. pitcher was just what I needed. Right size for 2 to 4 cups of espresso. Durable stainless steel with a pleasing shape.
2,short pitcher,I order this pitcher online. The photo on amazon.com shows 3 frothing pitchers but I only got one in the mail. Thats deceiving the customers not good. I used the tiny short pitcher to make cappuccino but my steam stem keeps hitting the bottom of the pitcher that's because its too short.I can barely get my small fingers around the handle. Folks if you need a frothing pitcher buy a larger size not this tinnie tiny thing.
3,Nice but way overpriced,"Bought this in cherry a week ago. Nice gong, works well, but very cheesy for the money. Tiny black plastic buttons on the bottom seem so flimsy -- especially compared to the nice solid wood pyramid. I am afraid they will break! For this money, at least include the four batteries! The battery door is held on with two tiny metal screws that require a tiny Phillips Head screwdriver -- not the kind of thing you are likely to have -- just lucky my husband had one for his miniature train projects. I bought this because I wanted the nice gong sound but there is clearly a niche for someone who can offer a timer with a good sound for less money. I couldn't find one other than this one and am glad to have it but still can't get over the price!"
3,"Lots of stuff, strange style....","The HVX Bootcamp DVD wasn't bad. It covers everything the HVX book covers in much the same way. Unfortunately it is rushed, few usable examples, and just different from the software training DVDs I am used to. Good info though."
1,"Lethargic performance, no electricity","It pains me to write this, but this Concert DVD is tremendously disappointing. From beginning to end, each song performance is professional but lacks any spark. Eric's own performance is so laid back, you expect him to nodd off ....I know I did , waiting for soemthing to happen. Maybe it's his new persona, but Slowhand has turned into Slowman."
2,beware,"I saw that this unit has problems with the 3Disc changer. At the store, the display model broke in front of my eyes. The changer drawers would not open. We opened a new box and the drawers did not break, but they had a mind of their own. I seemed to look past this for the most part. I went home with a third unit that was also unopened. My unit seems to be ok so far. Fortunately I know the guy that I bought this from and he is letting me exchange it for the philips 785, now that I have read reviews that confirm that these models have EXTREMELY quirky changers. just be careful."
5,Get it!,"Hmmm, I love the smell of Jovan Sex Appeal on a man. Spicy? Yes. Flowery? Yes. Woody? Yes. Sexy? Definitely!Want the man in your life to smell so nice and sexy? Get him Sex Appeal!(Review of Jovan Sex Appeal by Coty for Men 4.0 oz After Shave / Cologne Pour)"
4,For those who can't afford an iPod...,"For those Mac users who can't afford an iPod, the Nomad II is the next best thing in pocket-sized MP3 players. You can even use it to record voice memos and listen to the radio. Let's see your iPod buddies do that!"
5,Amazon is a wonderful company to do business with....,The Nomad 2 is the best mp3 player I have ever experienced and I would like to thank the staff of Amazon.com's help line for making my birthday present the best one ever. Thanks Alot!
2,Caution: Smartmedia cards >64Mb are not supported,"I'm generally pleased with this device, but you should be aware that although Smartmedia cards in excess of 64Mb are on the available now, they are not supported by the NOMAD II at present. Creative's website does not say when or if they will support larger SmartMedia cards.The implication that the SmartMedia slot provides an upgrade path is an illusion.If you want more capacity, you should look elsewhere."
5,"FM Radio with preset, 64 megs, and voice recorder WOW.","FM Radio with preset, 64 megs, and voice recorder WOW. I just got my Nomad 2 a few days ago, and i cant stop useing it. Every feature you could want is in this thing. A clear FM radio, and a great voice recorder. a Lock mode so you cant screw things up, and it holds 64 megs. For the price you CAN'T beat this. The new ones comming out are twice this much, and do not even have an FM radio. Here when you get sick of your MP3s you can turn on your radio. Very nice MP3 player. I Highly suggest you pick this one!"
2,"No, No, No on Creative's Nomad II","This player sports an impressive list of features on paper that are all underwhelming in use. The playlist's inability to support long filenames and the horrible reception of the FM tuner are the main reasons I returned my unit.Had it not been for these two issues I simply would have exchanged it for another that did not randomly lock up apporoximately every 20 minutes during mp3 playback.I hear the jukebox is a great alternative though its a little heave for its size, but definitely stay away from this poorly executed product."
1,read this before you buy this product ......,"I bought the product three months ago from amazon. A month ago it just stopped working and so I called up creative, they gave me an address that I had to send my product to. I got my nomad ll back today and guess what ..... it still does not work. I am utterly disgusted at the service that has been provided. Should one buy the product if not only it fails to perform as advertised but also the support does the same?"
5,THE BEST EVER!,"This is the best TV show ever produced. Clint Eastwood deserves a standing ovation for producing a hit for all times. Mercer is only the best. His singing, his lyrics even his music is top drawer. Watching this show flow by is like sitting in a warm bath, each segment better than the last and finally when we're looking at Mercers gravestone and the Angels Sing floating in the background we push the stop button on the DVD press play and settle back to watch it again. God bless you, Clint for giving us a present that will never stop giving. A show that Acents the Positive!"
1,Poorly made --- thermometer fell off.,It looks nice but isn't made well. The thermometer fell off when I started using it recently. Poorly glued. I had a plastic one for 20 years called Chill Check that recently broke after about 2 years dipped in the swimming pool. I haven't found a quality one like that since. It needs brass clips to hold it in and I don't think it's accurate either. Forget about this item.
2,b-o-r-i-n-g!,"how could something as interesting as african mythology become this boring? it's a mistery to me.i grew up with african mythology, with the stories, the jungle, the witch-doctors, the animals...all i got here was endless rhymes that might sound great if the story-teller were in front of me but was sleep inducing on paper.so why a 2 star you ask, instead of only one star? for the effort...this book was written based on days/years of hard work...i have to respect that."
5,Review on Jo Clancy's Desperate Disguises,"A very well written book, based on the writer's personal and professional experiences. A must have for anyone who is interested in mental illness and coping. I also have a personal interest in this book as Jo Clancy is my Aunt. In this book she has included several paragraphs about my late mother who suffered from mental illness most of her life. I can honestly say that Jo Clancy's book is one of the best mental health books that I have read."
1,I was robbed of my money,never received my order and i sent a email got no response$27.99 was literally robbed from me.web site order status says currently not available.my money was never refunded.don't trust this company
1,Horrible,The sides will not lock and it was hard to put together. I would not recommend this product
2,A definite disappointment,"I read this book expecting the same quality as the other X-Files books, but was sadly disappointed. Kevin J. Anderson did a much better job portraying the characters Mulder and Scully. The plot in this book moved very slowly even to the end. Those who don't watch the show will find this book a total bore and those who do will be let down."
2,Hackwork,"This is the first X-Files novel I have read. I didn't expect deathless prose, but neither did I expect the writing to be quite so poor nor the plot to be so mediocre. This would make for a very average episode were it to be filmed for television. When I read a novel based on a television series, I want to see a story that puts the characters in situations that we can't see on the tube, be it for budget considerations, mature story content, or whatever. I haven't read anything alse by Charles Grant, but I understand that he has a reputation as a horror writer of some quality. If so, he must have cranked this one out in a hurry for the paycheck."
2,As far as I'm concerned I'd rather read an X-Files script,"If I weren't an X-Files fan and didn't know how excellent the show was and how wonderful Mulder and Scully were I certaintly wouldn't run to watch an episode after this book. It was slow and very confusing at times, I found myself wanting to skip whole pages. I missed Mulder and Scully's quick paced banter they have on the show and found this not at all as good as any of the episodes. I hope others are better."
1,You get what you pay for,"On the surface, this looks like many of the pricier makes, but when you open it, it just looks cheap. The rice pot is a much thinner gauge metal than the pricier ones, and the contraption on the inside of the lid that's supposed to keep the vent open fails to keep the moisture inside. As a result, my batch of rice burned on the bottom and a great deal of moisture boiled out of the pot and all over my counter. (I only made 2 cups of rice and this is a 6-cup capacity, so it wasn't overfilled by any stretch of the imagination.)And worse, the rice smelled and tasted like sweet plastic. Dunno if it was from the non-stick coating or the plastic body, but it was awful and ruined the rice. I returned it promptly to Target.(NB: I already own a 3-cup National (Panasonic) fuzzy logic cooker - I've had it several years, I use it a lot and I love it. I just wanted a bigger one for our cabin and will get another National instead of trying to save a few bucks.)"
5,ESTUCHE 5 ESTRELLAS,"ELEGANTE, PROTEJE MUY BIEN A LA CAMARA DE LA LLUVIA, GOLPER SUDOR ETC ETC, RECOMENDADO PARA ALARGAR LA VIDA UTIL DE LA CAMARA, DE MUY BUEN MATERIAL. RECOMENDADO"
2,Bad Fit on Belt,"I would not recommend this case, as the belt loop is too loose, even for relatively wide belts, so it flops around. It does, however, have a small zipper pocket for a battery and a stick, which is nice, but I will not use this case. It fits the DSC-T10 fine."
1,Not the right size as indicated,"I bought this with the Sony Cybershot..thinking it would fit this camera. It said on the description that it is the right case for this camera. (DSC-W120).It is absoultely tiny. Couldn't even get the camera in it..no way! My son was extreamly dissapointed as its a present for today (Christmas day)!I just got online and ordered THIS ONE: (Precision Design Compact Digital Padded Carrying Case for Sony Cybershot DSC-T2, T70, T77, T100, T300, T500, T700, W35, W80, W90, W120, W130, W150, W1)Here's hoping it will be big enough!"
4,cheap and cheerful,"I bought it because it was offered for very cheap.It looks good, very practical yet makes my small flat sony take more space!"
4,Item is as it is displayed,The item is good enough for carrying a small cybershot camera.No problem.. with the product.
4,Must Need Camera Bag,"I brought this SONY camera bag for my SONY N2 camera. This is a requirement since the N2 package did not include the bag. However, the price is a little high at $14 for this little/simple bag. But, still need it to protect my N2."
3,Nice but to tall,"This is a nice case for slim camera's. I have the sony cyper shot t-10, the case is too tall for for the camrea. So the camera fits nicely, but there is extra space at the top so the camrea may fall out and not be as protected."
3,Okay,"This is a quality product, but it's a little too bulky for me. I have a Sony DSC-TX200V. Even though there's not a whole lot of extra room in the case with the camera in there, the case itself seems huge, mainly because of the square edges and stiff seams. YMMV."
4,Small Carrying Case,"If you have a sony cybershot, you might want to get something a little bigger. This case fits perfectly BUT there is about an inch of open space on each side leaving the chance to introduce sand or whatever inside the case. However, the quality of the case itself is good."
4,"Awesome, convenient, easy access to camera","I bought this case for my new shiny black Cybershot T-100. Beacuse of the large screen on T-100 you need to have a case to protect the camera. The inside of the case is soft and avoids any scraches to the LCD screen. The convenient belt clip allow the user to access camera very easy and fast, makes your hands free not to carry the camera all the time. A small zipped section in the front helps you store extra memory card or adaptor. I took this with me to my trip to Tokyo. I felt this is a great buy and a great price at Amazon. com. I am completely satisfied with the purchase."
3,Good one for a Very Slim Digi Camera.,"This is a very good one for a Very slim Digi Camera. You can put 2 batteries ( with little bit hardwork). Very handy.If you are planning for a day long trip with casual photography and video recording, i would suggest to go for a little big one , which can carry upto 4 batteries."
3,"Too ""Slim"" for Sony W170","The case is functional and well constructed. I chose this case based upon Amazon's recommended-accessories offer when purchasing a Sony DCS-W170 camera. However, I would be more please if the case were a touch larger. The camera alone is a tight squeeze to fit into the case and renders the small zippered pocket is useless. By itself the zippered pocket is too small to hold anything other and a memory stick - the ""G"" battery is too large to fit into the pocket."
3,Camera case -- pretty snug,Item came in good time and in good condition. It was a pretty tight fit to get the camera into the case. Had hoped it would be a little larger.
5,Linny Nance/On & Poppin,"This is an awesome Cd. As a first time listener, this artist is destined for success."
1,Not a good purchase,"Very disappointed. After paying an extra 12.07 customs, the dvds don't work on my machine. I'll ask friends for help but what does 'wrong region' mean? Other American dvds have worked OK. An expensive mistake."
2,Anglophilia won't get you past this morose duo,"Perhaps the previous reviewers admire an adherence to Sayers' prose. Can't say--never read the stories, just watched the foppish Ian Carmichael version. Here, both the visual images and character portrayals of Peter and Harriet are very washed-out. Wimsey's wit, eloquence and energy is almost lost in conflictedness and malaise. Bunter is multi-talented, but without a Jeeves-like irony. Parker almost vanishes into the wallpaper. Perhaps you can still enjoy the scenery, or try Campion."
5,Dorothy L. Sayers Mysteries,"Excellent! The only difficulty I find is that the writers have changed the story in places, but fortunately only in minor areas. But only Sayers purists would mind."
3,Perhaps its a matter of taste,"I must agree with the previous reviewer who felt the pair was washed out. Many of the other reviewers say that Petherbridge is superior to Carmichael because the latter's version of Wimsey was too foppish -- I think they need to reread their Sayers. Wimsey's often described as, at least on the surface, a ""silly-ass about town"". He is intended to come across as foppish and yet be so much more; I've always felt that if Carmichael had been younger when he'd done the part he would have been perfect. Petherbridge needed to lighten up some to truly capture the sparkle necessary to carry the role for me. Also, while I expected Harriet to be a little darker in tone than her lord, she ought to have an irrepressible underlying spark and I felt that could have been better portrayed. All in all, still very worth the watch. I think the perfect Wimsey video series has yet to be created and I look forward to seeing it eventually materialize."
3,"Good, but could have been better",Overall very entertaining and enjoyable.Strong Poison and Have his Caracass were very nicely done and very entertaining. I was somewhat disappointed by the severe editing done to Gaudy Night. Sayers had a very competent academic background with which she continually challenged the reader. This was reduced to a mere few scenes.
5,Wonderful realizations of fantastic books!,"They have done the impossible: they have nobly and credibly cast the roles of Harriet Vane (Harriet Walter) and Lord Peter Whimsey (Edward Petherdridge). From this, all else follows. The chemistry between Peter and Harriet is magical. And they are surrounded by a most able and fascinating group of supporting characters. The books are fairly treated, and thoroughly dramatized (though I miss Peter's nephew in Gaudy Night). The books are most loveable, and so are these adaptations.If I have one regret it is that the 4th book in this cycle, Busman's Honeymoon, could not have been undertaken by this same crew. But by all means, do get this set and you will be amply rewarded!"
4,Still missing one episode,"We enjoyed this series very much, a worthwhile addition to the earlier Ian Carmichael box set.Sadly, the ""Busman's Honeymoon"" episode was not included (hence 4 stars not 5), but here's hoping that it will be released at some stage."
3,Chip & crack too easily,"I love this set for my everyday use. I have owned it for about 3 years. I also enjoy using it for company because it is so attractive. I get many compliments. However, I have problems with chipping and cracking, and there are no children in my household! I have had two plates crack, 3 bowls chip and I even had 3 mugs have their bottoms completely fall off as I filled the mug with hot water for tea (very dangerous!). I am going to contact the manufacturer to receive replacements."
2,mugs aren't durable,"I loved the way these dishes looked, but after 2 months of owning them, I have broken 2 of the handles off the mugs while washing them. I didn't drop either, they just came apart in my hands. Really? I wish I had gone with a Corelle set."
1,Don't waste your money,"These chip and break and are a waste of money. They look nice, but the quality is crappy, very disappointing."
2,very disappointing....,"My husband and I registered for two sets of this dinnerware and the completer set for our 2008 wedding. At this point we have lost so many pieces to cracks and chips that I am in the market for new dinnerware. They say they are microwavable, but if you are planning on using them in your microwave...save your money. They are absolutely adorable and they really look great in person, but they only lasted for two years. Very disappointing!! I can only imagine how poorly they would perform in a household with children."
2,watch out,"I love the color of the Sango avacado, LOVE IT, but unfortunately all my mugs and bowls have chipped on the edges. My Sango blue mugs and bowls have lasted forever without any damage, but the avacado is a little more fragile and it chips."
4,"Excellent Picture, interesting features","This VCR provides excellent picture sharpness and clarity. The RW/FF speed is also excellent. My favorite feature was a complete surprise: VCR reads sub-channel info and on many channels will display the name of the current program onscreen, even during commercials!Programming and timer recording leave something to be desired however. There is no way to record a show more than once (ie every day, once a week). In my area VCRPlus channels do not match what the VCR thinks and requires manual mapping of VCR channel to actual channel."
4,"More Morgana, please!","Considering the huge amount of vintage material that has been re-issued on CD, it seems a crime that so little of Morgana King's work is currently available. ""Tender Moments"", a compilation from various releases of the 70's and 80's, features the kind of heartfelt ballads that her fans will love. Ms. King's exotic voice and style may be an acquired taste, but I, for one, cannot resist her interpretations of material like ""Body and Soul"", ""Lilac Wine"", ""Time After Time"" ""Imagination"", ""I'm Old Fashioned"" and ""Like Someone in Love"". Why am I giving only 4 stars? I'm reserving the fifth star for a re-issue of her classic 1960's LP ""A Taste of Honey"" which remains a giant in my memory, even though it's been at least 20 years since I've listened to it."
5,Bought for an young teen,I bought this for my 14 year old and he spent hours planning and plotting. It really inspired his imagination
5,Great for keys.,I got this to cary my keys on my belt loop. I have always done this with my keys. And it has always made people ask me if I work at whatever random store I am in.Great product.
3,Some of his best songs missing on this DVD,"The box(cover) is not in acrylic, it's made of cardboard and seems to be very fragil,There are some good videos but still many of his greatest hits missing here such as Sevilla, Amiga, and many other classic songs. it worths it just because of El auto radio canta wich is very hard to find. He still is one of the greates spanish singers and also one of the sexiest artist and man"
3,Neat Appliance,"I recieved this as a gift and overall it has worked pretty well, not as easy as the infomercial makes it seem, but nothing ever is."
1,Full of Pagan information,"I bought this book to add to my children's library. However, after reading a few pages of this, I burned it. It contains information and history on Pagan gods that I do not want my children to learn. It puts this information as ""interesting side notes"" about what was going on around Abraham. I was very disappointed in this publisher for adding this information and presenting it as nearly equal in importance as the Bible stories themselves. If I had wanted a manual on Paganism, then I would have bought one: having that included in a Bible story book is very misleading to consumers."
5,When Less is More!,"Economy of baton technique gives me the pleasure of watching the orchestra, not a personality. Dr. Reiner 'rehearsed' the orchestra, here the great Chicago Symphony, before the performance. The result is most gratifying. Say what you will, but technicians of this caliber are far and few in this day and age. While the film and recording are just O.K., I think and hope, that WGN television, will release more of these wonderful documents of this important musicians work."
1,"Junk, but at least it's cheap.","This frisbee held up for 2 or 3 days of playing once a day with my dog, and keeping it locked away when not playing so she couldn't chew on it. The frisbee is thin and light, so once it gets damaged it just won't fly. At least the Kong frisbee (which she also managed to trash) would still fly for a while after it started getting chewed up. Really it's only redeeming quality is that it's cheap. But the Kong lasted me more than twice as long and was less than twice the price."
3,Dog destroyed it in 5 minutes,"I thought this was a somewhat indestructable product, so I bought two. It took only a few minutes for the dog to tear off the lip surrounding the frisbee. Oh well, back to the drawing board."
4,Truely special and (eventually) comforting.,"One concerned with self-worth recommended this book to me right during IB exams time. Impossible to describe with one-word adjectives, this book achieves just the right balance between personal story-telling and literary devices such as symbolism. Reading it once will leave you with a rare feeling of empathy and comfort since Esther readily shares the most unusual views about our society and our role in it. Analysing it is worth the effort: meaningful patterns about her personality are carefully hidden. Truely fulfilling."
3,Nice overall,"Well, this is a delightful CD, but I find that the tempo in the first movement of the Concerto #2 to be WAY too fast. It sounds like the flute and the orchestra are running the 200-meter dash. It's almost too fast to follow and enjoy."
2,Disappointing,"Granted that Mr. Gallois is a technically accomplished flutist, there is something very much amiss in this rendering of the Mozart concertos. What is missing is beauty in phrasing, or perhaps better put, good taste. Some of the phrasing is downright bizarre. I find the Ransom Wilson recording of these concertos much more enjoyable."
1,Worse Mitt Ever,Do not buy these!!!! It does not hold up to the heat. I burned my hands carrying my oven tray wearing these mitts. My mitts are burned from the heat in the oven and the stove.
5,great for men trying to get waves,So I have been in the wave game since 5th grade and now im 23; tried every product out there but let me tell you nothing goes harder than the luster's pink lotion... I use it all the time and it washes out real easy...definitely a must have for men wanting waves.
3,Some Muscle Mopars,"This is a good collection of footage and information about several Classic Mopars of the Muscle era. I do wish that they had featured more cars, but the information provided and the footage of the cars in motion was quite enjoyable. There is also some information on the 1964 Chrysler Turbine cars."
3,Lousy Paper path,"Great machine if you like jams etc. It worked great for about a year and then started sending multiple pages thru at the same time. Currently it sends up to 30 pages through and jams ruining all the paper. Forget this one, its too bad it had good promise."
5,A nescesary view into the direction of contemporary theater,"This short book gives a view into the methods of Anne Bogarts visionary style. Although no book can do Ms. Bogart justice, VIEWPOINTS allows readers to understand how her presence is effecting American contemporary theater. Her compassion, love for theater, and energy pervade every essay. Ms. Bogart's work is in line with Brecht and Stanislavski and this book is an insight into her brilliance."
5,Beautiful if you like the organ,"I'm very surprised this hasn't gotten any reviews! This is good music, and you'll like it if you like Bach's organ compositions. Buxtehude had a strong influence on Bach, the latter of which traveled over 400 km to see the former, and stayed for three months. The CD begins with a very grand and virtuosic praeludium, a specialty of Buxtehude, which lasts nine and a half minutes. This is followed by relaxed, beautiful choral preludes, similar to some of Bach's choral preludes. This is followed by a chaconne, two more chorale preludes (including the famous Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott), a setting of the Te Deum, two more choral preludes framing a passacaglia, and a final Praeludium of eleven minutes. Wolfgang Rubsam is a talented organist and he chooses all the right stops for these works. This is a good disc if you want to explore the composer who had a strong influence on Bach."
1,The author of this book should be ashamed.,"Potential book buyer: read the reviews on this book very carefully. All positive reviews have been secretly written by the same person under different names. Just click on the user's name and look to see if they've written other reviews...nope, they haven't since ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR THE BOOK HAVE CLEARLY BEEN WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR.Worse still, this guy shamelessly plugs his book by writing book ""reviews"" on the listings for more famous and far more useful books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad and the Millionaire Next Door."
3,Shakespeare it ain't,"Admirably brief (62 pages), this book provides a smorgasbord of Vanguard index-fund model portfolios and suggestions on how to begin to accumulate them."
3,Great for a challenge.,"I've been doing 1000 plus piece puzzles for a long time and wanted something that would take a bit more time. It keeps your mind sharp. As other reviewers said, this puzzle is huge. I was not prepared for the size. It took up my entire bedroom floor. It was also incredibly difficult. It took me two months. That's a long time to go without using a big part of your floor! One frustrating part of this puzzle is that the pieces are cut so they fit but are not right(without forcing) and look right and then you later realize it is a mistake. The number of pieces is a huge challenge. It took me a week just to sort the pieces in the beginning so I could find a place to start. I almost gave up on the puzzle a few times. But once finished, it is beautiful and well worth the time and energy."
1,Really disappoint at its quality,"I bought this puzzle as a gift to my nephew. After she finished assembly the puzzle, she told me that there has two pieces of puzzle is duplicated and can't can't complete the whole pattern. It is a big quality issue in this small product. I am losing the confidence in product made in USA, if such thing repeats again and again."
3,"Missing pieces, but good customer service...","I did this puzzle last summer. Shipping was amazingly fast (one day!) and the puzzle took me about 2 weeks to complete. However, I was disappointed to find that I was missing 4 pieces and had duplicates of 4 other pieces! When I contacted Ravensburger, they sent me a new puzzle right away. This was fine with me...but I would have been upset if I was planning to glue and display the puzzle. (From what I understand, they make puzzles in uniquely cut, small batches, so I would be unable to retrieve my missing pieces from the new puzzle they sent me).I will be purchasing from Ravensburger again, because the quality was just so great. The pieces lock together with a satisfying snap and there are only a few ""oddball"" shaped ones."
4,Still relevant today; must-read for future fashion professionals,"This was one of the first books I read about the business of fashion, and I've been hooked ever since. Teri Agins' book provides an informative perspective on the recent history of the important fashion houses. It is still relevant today, and is a good read for anyone who loves learning about the business of fashion."
4,The Trickle-Up Theory as it Relates to Marketing,"Although the trickle-up theory of fashion is nothing new, this book does a great job of relating it to the evolution of marketing in the 20th century, discussing the result on the current fashion business, and predictions for its impact on the future. Great read."
2,Review of Conant TH-20 Weather Station,"The TH-20 is a nice looking easy to read Weather Station. but that's where the good part ends. I find that comparing the TH-20 to the Furnace Thermoustat(Digital), the TH-20 reads 3to4 degrees too high. I have also checked the TH-20 against two other Temp. Gages, with the same results. The Humidity Gage reads at least 10% too high compared to two other gage's. Needless to say, Iam not happy with the TH-20."
3,"Less Art, More Culture","This is a survey of American culture, as manifested in everything from travel books, film, dance, to the fine arts. It lurches from subject to subject at times, but its strength is that it places the fine arts in their cultural context."
4,The anatomy of the short sale-,"Bill O'Neal has done a great deal in this brief book (It was originally a pamplet)esplaining the correct time ot sell stocks short. Contrary to popular opinion you should not attempt to sell short at a stocks 52 week high. You first wait for the initial pull back and for the stock to fail on 3 attempted rallies, you should short on the 3rd failed rally, this is the point of proven weakness. O'Neal suggests shorting previous market leaders when they have fallen out of favor.He backs up his teachings with over 120 real historical bar charts showing volume and showing when to short on each one. You can double your chances as a trader by trading both sides of the market. I highly recommend this book to all traders along with all of O'Neal's other books and Investor's Business Daily. I am very glad Mr. O'Neal decided to share his research and experience with the general public."
2,Will Lose Respect for the Author.....,"This book, unfortunately, is perhaps a mockery of the author's reputation. The first few pages (Part 1 and Part 2 - each may be about 10 pages or so) talk about when to short in very abstract sense and then the mechanics of shorting. Part 3 of the book is a gigantic collection of stock charts which provide some ""itsy-bitsy"" techincal mumbo-jumbo scribbled along a chart with an indicator saying ""short here""!! It borders on amusement at times. On a serious note, the author does clearly point out that shorting is a risky business and does provide tons of examples. One could only wish that the author had distilled all the information in his 150 or so charts and actually described ""something"" that will answer the question posed as the title of the book. It is particulary disappointing that the author wrote one of my all-time favorite investing book, and I am a big fan of Investors Business Digest. leaf through this book, but not buy it."
2,"Nothing new, plenty of charts","I used to be a big IBD fan in the nineties. But during the bear market I grew up and learned the lessons the hard way as the writer is too bullish too often. I was disappointed that the writer is just trying to profit from a bunch of charts and the usual IBD after-the-fact claim to being right. During the bear market I was still reading IBD and I never once read anywhere where he suggested, recommended or alluded to any of the short trades he mentions in the book."
3,Good Info On Selling Stocks Short!,"* The steps mention inside this book can still be apply with the current market.* If you are looking for selling stocks short, this book is definitely for you.* The only thing we need to succeed in this industry is for us to have a high capital at the very beginning."
2,Shorting Stock,This book only covers shorting stocks based on weekly charts. I would have liked to see daily and intra daily charts information.
5,How to make your Dad happy!,"My parents, who live in southeast Texas,lost their home to Hurricane Ike in September 2008. My Father lost all of his whips and leather supplies in the flood. He is 79 years old and it was extremely hard for him to come thru this ordeal. One day he mentioned how he would love to have a book about making whips. I explained to him that the computer I purchased for him last Christmas would give him the world at his fingertips. Up until then he had only used it to play solitare and look at the photos of the build on their new log home. I showed him how to use Amazon.com and you would have thought I created the best thing since sliced bread. The book arrived in a few days and he couldn't get enough of it! It gave him all of the information he was searching for all these years. When the catalog from Tandy leather came, which I also ordered on line, he was like a kid in a candy store! So if you want to make a craftsman happy, buy this book!"
2,Buyer Beware Too big for our cases,"Bought these locks based on reviews, however they are too big to fit through the hasps on our cases. They feel heavy and are easy to set, but check the size before you order"
1,$142? you are kidding right?,"math concept of the day: apparently the value of a book is inversely proportional to its price. no that's not fair. that would imply that spivak's calculus would cost less than a dollar, compared to this one."
2,Spark Notes for Calculus with exercises,"This is the book used for Math 115 and 116 (calculus I, II regular) here at the University of Michigan. And having used it, I would say it is only good as a spark notes version of the real thing. It is a book for engineers. No proofs and very little explanation of where the theorems came from. Thus, if you are an engineer and wants to use calculus mainly as a tool, then this might be the book for you. It certainly explains the concepts and its applications in the most succinct form.However, if you plan to take upper level theoretical math classes later, DO NOT LEARN FROM THIS BOOK. You will only realize that you learned nothing later on. If you really want a thorough, rigorous training in calculus, buy the book by Apostol instead. That's the one used by the students at Caltech and MIT. Otherwise, you can always stick with Stewart."
1,Inadequate Text,"I was supposed to use this book for part of multi-variable calculus course--but it proved to be so utterly useless I used Strang's text from MIT Opencoursewear. The concepts covered in this book are quite simple and if you have a decent professor, the book hardly matters. If you are suffering, use MIT.Note: For the first time ever, I threw away my textbook after the end of the course. I have otherwise saved all of my math textbooks and resold everything else. This sorry excuse for a textbook--in the garbage."
1,Do not buy the Kindle Edition,"The Kindle Edition has way too many conversion errors and is difficult to read. Quite a few pieces of subscript and superscript were not properly transposed, completely altering the problems in the sections. On top of that, it is missing the back inside cover of the book, which has over a dozen more formulas for solving indefinite integrals. At this point I'm likely going to have to purchase a copy of the text unless I want to spend time and money photocopying my assignments and formulas from the library. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have purchased the eBook in the first place."
3,Calc. book.,"Very impressed with this product. Good considering the price paid for it.There is some writing in it, but that's expected."
1,terrible,"Godhead's version of ""Fascination Street"" is possibly the only thing worth listening to on here. Let's face it. The Cure can be covered by no one. I don't even like most of the bands on here. Why I bought this, I have no idea, but I think I was curious to hear Joy Electric's cover of ""Pictures of You"", which is possibly the most atrocious, horrendous monstrosity I have ever heard. And I like J.E. The rest of this is total turd, these ""industrial/electronic"" bands are Cleopatra's typical brand of talentless poop. Maybe if they would have gotten some decent electronic bands to do this album, it would have been somewhat worthwile. Maybe released by a different label, say Metropolis, it would be less offensive. Stick to the real thing, it's the only way to go."
1,Did not like,"I tried the Elixir and after only a week I though they were not doing well so I tried these. The ratings on here are good. I even got two packages since the price was right. Well, I like the Elixir's better. These were one third the cost. Learning about strings is expensive. These are the same as light - medium. I was running medium on the Elixir's but that was too much. The size on these are better but I like the sound of the Elixir's more. The feel of these strings are ok though.. I do not like the overall sound of the strings but on some songs they are not too bad. Without the coating of the Elixirs, they are better as strings. They are not strong enough on a lot of sounds though."
4,Not Disappointed. :D,"This is my first time with these strings and I like'em. They sound great. Tuning it was kind of weird, took longer than normal but they work great. They are also a lot more vibrant than the cheap First Act strings I previously used. They were the only strings accessible to me at the time. These Ernie's are a recommendation to all. No disappointments. So far."
4,One big run,"Lieutenant Marosi of the border patrol recognizes the body of his friend Eva who was shot while trying to cross the border from Hungary to Austria in 1959. In order to understand what drove his friend to her death, he follows the trail of her life, and finds Livia, who's in a hospital after being shot by her husband. He finds out that Eva was strong in her beliefs in a dangerous time, and that Eva was having an affair with Livia. Galgóczi's amazing novel is full of Hungarian politics, as well as character studies of people struggling with low expectations and betrayals. The book is also the basis of the movie ""Another Way"", but the book is much more clear about Eva's motivations for trying to leave the country."
1,"Watch out, Remake Alert","Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes."
5,Yum!,"Purchased the beans to make my own vanilla extract! Left the package on the counter overnight (closed, of course) and the next morning the whole house smelled like vanilla! The beans are very fragrant and are very moist. Slit them down the middle and stuffed them into a bottle of vodka, left them for a few months and voila! Some pretty great vanilla extract!I want to try it with a bottle of rum next, so I will be buying more soon!"
3,Good Blues,"Ladies not only sing the blues, but they fight back in Outlandish Blues, as Honorée Fannone Jeffers paints her verse pictures. In the poem The Battered Blues she writes, ""He hit me more times for being still/Misery on my porch and sadness on my steps/I washed off his dust and his sorry pain bought me a switchblade shouting out his name.""There is an exploration of the crazy/outlandish life that is Southern Black life in America. There is also an interesting and thought provoking series of persona poems from offered from the perspective of women in the Old Testament (Lot's Wife, Hagar and Sarai). Depth and passion punctuate her work. I would like to think that part of a writer's mandate is to illustrate the absurd in our existence in order to make it less so. In the pages of Outlandish Blues one will find pieces thoughtfully crafted to ease us down that right road."
1,Doesn't smell good,"Love Happy Bunny, but this air fresher doesn't freshen the air - it does the EXACT opposite. After 1/2 a day in the car, we actually had to throw the air freshener out because it smelled aweful!"
1,Poor,"For A&E to call these ""remastered"" is a joke. The quality is poor, with scratches, obvious splices, a hum throughout some soundtracks - like THE DIRTY WORD in set 2. The only bright spot is that these shows are otherwise unavailable. But don't expect anything like DVD quality."
1,"Easily chip, will look like garbage after just a few years","I've had this set of dishes for about 5 years, and almost every single plat and bowl have either a crack or chip in them. They look like garbage and were made like garbage. I'd buy something a little better next time."
5,Distributor Cap and Rotor,"Good price on the combo: distributor cap and rotor, in this case for a 1985 BMW 318i. Genuine Bosch parts; made in Spain. They work fine."
2,Lesser Vicente effort,"This film features a good cast, but the story is merely conventional,i'ts Mexican-Spanish co production roots are difficult to hide and it doesn't seem like a Mexican or a Spanish film but a mixture, the movie lasts much too long dealing with the gambling aspect and not enough time with the love story aspect which was more interesting and the result is a film which end's up being barely mediocre."
3,Too Slow,This book was so slow I almost didn't finish it. I finished two other books while reading this. I understood Esperanza's inner conflict and even though I was bored to death I believe this is very real. I could easily see someone going through this and being just as naive and conflicted as Esperanza. I think that this book is for someone in their 20s. Since I'm in mid-30s this book was not that engaging.
4,"Great, though a little on the heavier side for the novice studier.","This one is a little bit heavier of a read, but it's really fascinating. I think it's a little easier for me to read because it really relates to the history and philosophy courses I've taken in college, and to the history programs I've watched on A&E.; My only complaint is that the author jumps around a lot from people to people, rather than going in chronological order. Therefor, as he progresses from person to person, it bounces from, say, the 18th century to the 16th, to the 19th, and back to the 16th. To me that makes it harder to follow since I like things in a progressive order when about a single subject like this.However, I still recommend this to anyone who is curious about the birth of neurology and the human fascination with the 'soul' throughout history, and the church's influence on such.I would not recommend this to anyone with weak reading skills."
1,Misnomer in title,I am sorry that you recommended this book to me. it is way off the mark of The Discovery of the brain.In future when Amazon recommend a book i will review with trepidation.This book was a travesty of historical blurb involving philosophers who have nothing to do with the brain in modern times
1,"If you bought this CD, you were jipped!","Thank God for sound bites. Otherwise, I may have been led to purchase this CD. At first glance I thought it looked decent, cause I always pay attention to the covers. Does this guy fancy himself as some sort of model? PLEASE!!! The songs are hardly melodious and have no sense of apparent harmony. As other reviewers have stated, the material is all so dry and unoriginal. YAWNNNNN. The voice is hardly what I would call marketable! I can't believe this dude got someone to sign him on...oh well he'll turn out to be a 1-album wonder like the rest! Take a big PASS on this lame CD, trust me!"
1,Over priced camera that leaks,"Well I bought this camera a few weeks ago to go hawaii. Well it leaked after one roll of film so cleaned it out and let dry over night and loaded it again the next day and leaked again to where the camera didnt work anymore. Well I ended up getting some underwater disposable cameras. When I got the film developed the the disposable pics actually came out better than the 1 roll that came out of my $... camera (imagine that). Well now Im trying to get it repaired or replaced and I have to pay to ship it to them plus another $... I have to send to them for processing, what is up with that if I have a warrenty and its faulty equipment they should cover at the the shipping back to me. Over all There is nothing that I can recomend about this camera from the pics to the service. Would give it a 0 if possible."
4,Perfect fit for my Sears HEPA Filter,"This pre-filter was a PERFECT fit for my Sears model 83154/83155 filter fan, no cutting necessary. It is slightly thicker than the original pre-filter, and seems to actually work better. One very positive surprise, this is a two-pack box -- there are two pre-filters in this box."
2,Tissot Quadrato watch,"This is my second Tissot watch. I have a T touch as well. I am a little disappointed with this watch. It is difficult for me to read the time because the numerals are chrome, not white. I've gotten used to it but I prefer the T touch white face."
4,"""Standing Legs"" is the best of the Two","""Standing Legs"" is the best from The Firm collection, period. (It really outpaces the hurried workouts the company seems to release every week now; I do not like any of the new material.) I get a serious conditioning session as well as a little cardio each time I do this workout. I owned it on VHS for years; I was glad when they transferred it to DVD to make it more accessible for my workouts. I admit that the wardrobe is dated, but you get pass it when you are pumping the iron, doing the leg presses, and dripping with perspiration. I'm not a huge fan of the ""Upper Body"" segment, which is why I gave this four instead of five stars. I usually combine standing legs with a med ball or kettlebell workout to get a complete body workout."
4,Delighted,The DVD was/is in great condition. The shipping was prompt. I had this workout when it was on VHS & I loved it (the Standing Legs one) because it has no 'floor work.' How ironic that the concept finally caught on!
5,Very enjoyable and do-able,Our family gets up at 6am (normally) and walks together right in our own living room. We really do enjoy it.
4,Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds,I love this CD because it's an easy quick workout of 20 or 30 minutes. I can just walk in the house and pop in the CD and get to exercising.
3,A great way to get moving,"This was the first Leslie Sansone DVD that I bought - and I haven't looked back since. These programmes are an excellent way to get up off the couch and get moving. I found that they were an excellent introduction to the Leslie Sansone way of doing things. The one and two mile quickly become too tame, and I had to move on to bigger and better programmes - like the 4 mile super challenge!"
3,Too slow for an advanced person,"I'm more of an advanced walker, I like Leslie Sansone's ""Fast & Firm! 4 Really Big Miles"" DVD. This was too slow for me. If you are a beginner, this would be great video to get you started."
4,Good phone at a good price,"I was very pleased with the price of this phone. The sound quality is really good, except that I can't make it loud enough. I wish I was able to turn it way up, since I like to talk on my phone while I do household chores.Otherwise, a great product. I highly recommend it!"
4,Great for the money,"This is a great phone for the money. It has all the basic features, and it was rated a Consumer Reports best buy in their February 2000 test of cordless phones (which is why I bought it).It doesn't have a headset jack, and no caller id, but the reception is good, it sounds great, and it's very simple to use. The memory dialer seems a bit slow too."
5,A Good Product At A Good Price,"This cordless phone by Uniden is 900 mghz for excellent clarity and range. The price is unbeatable. We bought one for my father-in-law who fights anything techno with a ferocity sometimes found in 80 year olds.Now, he delights in telling all his friends about this phone. How he can walk around without worry over tripping over a cord, how we programmed his memory numbers so he can call people more easily and his favorite feature--the pager. If he misplaces the phone, which we all have done, he simply presses the page button on the base in his kitchen, and hears his phone calling from it's hiding place!"
4,Flyfisher's Guide to Pennsylvania,Book covered all of fundamentals of Pennsylvania fly fishing.Good for novices and out of town people. Gives needed information regarding lodging and services. The book does fall short in the amount of streams visited. Many wild trout and stocked streams went unmentioned. This was a big miss.
3,flyfisher's Guide to Pennsylvania by Dave Wolf,"If you are looking for a book to give you general knowledge on better known trout fishing streams in Pennsylvania, then this book will meet your needs. Unfortunately, the author does not do a good job of covering remote streams in many parts of the state that are excellent producing streams and beautiful places to fish. I was especially disappointed in his lack of coverage of streams in McKean and Warren County. I would not recommend this book to an avid Pennsylvania fisherman. The book is adequate for an out-of-state fisherman who is looking to fish some of the more popular streams in PA."
1,Not the Best,"Wolf's description of the Quittapahilla is pure fantasy. I live near the stream and fish it, but don't recognize it in his words. His other descriptions seem generally OK, but if you want a better guide, one that carefully avoids exaggeration and inaccuracy, buy Charles Meck's. I rate this book one star primarily to offset the manipulation of having multiple reviews from the same reviewer give it five stars."
3,good sculpting video,This video compilation is definitly outdated set-wise but for the firm dedicated followers you will recognise the cast and the videos this came from.It is a good lower body sculpting video. I do not think there was nearly enough cardio to get your heart rate up if you are a advanced exerciser so I would use it as a cross-trainer.
1,completely unreliable,"I asked & received this machine for xmas from my husband. Every other time I used it I had a problem with it. Finally the ""low-bean"" light started blinking and never went off no matter how much I emptied and cleaned all the inside of the machine, and added and subtracted beans. It is also a very flimsy machine. It doesn't feel sturdy when you are working with it. The manual is so difficult to read and doesn't help. Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this machine. I am returning it tomorrow (after 4 days of using it) and will never buy Saeco again. If they are not willing to use tight quality control on their products (I read some other reviews like mine meaning this is not an isolated incident)they are not using it on any of their products."
5,Great for listening or background,"This is one of those superbly recorded CDs I like to recommend purely on the basis of its sound quality, although the music itself is nothing to sneeze at. Of course, you have to like listening to so-called new age music as well, but for many people this will be simply relaxing, peaceful music.Much better than average for this type of music, and the actual sound quality is first rate -- it will not embarass expensive stereo gear, and sounds good out of anything from a cheap boombox to $5000 CD players. I am a headphone fan and have several pair of over-$150 headphones... great listening. Recommended!"
4,creme de la creme,Wow! Jeri Brown. Substance like this is palpable!Years ago I saw Mel Torme in a club. He actually came over to our table to greet someone. I raced to the bathroom so I wouldn't have to say hi. Truly his performance was otherworldly pristine and I just couldn't come down into ordinary yet. A guy at our table had the same reaction and had also disappeared!Jeri Brown can strike those same sentiments. Chiming those deep chords that make you think and feel simultaneously. Major or minor the message homes true as an arrow. For those who hate jazz this is probably not the easiest music. No pop. But these sounds bridge mainstream alternative and jazz while staying mainstream. Not as well known as she deserves!A great addition to a music library. Get it while you can.
4,Entertaining read,"This effort from Buchanan does a good job of using the local Miami flavor to separate it from other procedural efforts. The cold case elements as well as present day drama work well together. While the plot elements were anything but predictable, the prose was a bit tepid which kept it from being even better."
1,Not worth the effort,I bought one of these a while back because it was cheap Charged it overnight and it was dead in less than 12 hours with no talk time. Not worth the trouble to ship it back. Save money and aggravation and buy OEM or OEM spec.
1,You got to be kidding,"I recently got on a I must get fit kick so I have purchased several exercise DVDs. I knew about Richard's videos and I do like to dance around when I walk outside. I wanted something to do on inclement weather days.Well the songs on the video sounded good. However when I put on the DVD it there was no instructions on how to do the moves. It seemed that Richard was just winging it as he listened to the music, free style so to speak.If you are like me and need instructions and easy to follow routines, I would not recommend this for you. If you just like to dance and don't care about how to do the specific movements then get this one. Richard is funny and energetic."
3,sweatin to the oldies part2,"I liked number one so well thought I would get number 2, I dont like it there is more exercising and less dance and I wanted the dance, so I have modified it to my moves and ignore Richard and just dance to the music."
1,"Yes, it's great but...","This is a great product- We've been using ours for over 5 years, and it's totally changed the way we watch TV- The machine records our shows per the timer recording feature, and we watch them when we have time (3 kids), and we fast forward through all of the ads- BUT as of this January thanks to ""big brother"" looking out for our best interests, this thing is obsolete- The tuner is analog- Sure, you can put a converter in line, but the converter becomes your tuner- So, basically this unit is nothing but a hard drive / DVD player- No more programing the tuner for watching your favorite TV on your own schedule- Bummer!"
4,Not bad for what it does...,"It was a good product for its time. At this point it is lacking some key features such as MPEG4 recordings, networking ability, TV guide (such as TiVo) and ability to support multiple disk format. The key feature being networking ability. I would like to be able to use the unit in the bedroom to view shows recorded in the livingroom -- using the home computer network. That way I do not have to burn any disks.Need to remember to reformat the hard drive periodically to make sure it does not mess up. I try to do that once every other month. I have never had any issues. Very reliable product. The remote design could use some help."
1,Not a Panasonic fan anymore,"Initially, I really liked this unit. Then, about 2 weeks later, it started having trouble, and hasn't worked right since. Despite a month at the ""factory authorized"" service center (over an hour away, even though I live in a _major_ city, and only open inconvenient hours), it still doesn't work right. It won't even record at all now. Panasonic's response: bring it back to the service center...again. No other option. They won't replace it. Not even a hint of how long it'll take this time. So right now I have a _really_ expensive doorstop.I've read a lot of other positive reviews, but I wish I'd never bought this thing."
3,how to resolve the recover issue,"My recorder started going to self check mode and then says bye... left it like that for a while. Today decided to repair myself.The root cause of this , the dvd is stuck inside the dvd drive. the unit is not able to open after that. every time I turn the power it goes into infinite self check mode. I opened the top case and then the front case. Aftre this i removed the screws that hold the dvd burner TOp cover and pulled the Stuck DVD myself. It is working fine after that.."
3,CANNOT COPY PRE-RECORDED VHS TAPES!!!!,"I just purchased this device because I was having too much trouble using my computer to copy VHS tapes. I needed something that burned the tapes directly to disc instead of copying the movie to a hard drive and then encoding it for 48 hours! However, I found out that this device will not allow you to copy a pre-recorded VHS tape, and as far as I can tell they do not warn you about that ahead of time. I will be returning mine tomorrow."
4,Great Reccorder,I have had a wonderful time with this DVD recorder. The fact that it has a hard drive makes recording a snap. I could not record the many programs I like without having a hard drive.The only problem I found with it was the documentation on operating the device. Any problem I had with it was overcome by reading the reviews on Amazon. They allowed me to see how others dealt with problems and saved me time.
5,Excellent purchase,"I have a large coffin that can hold a 12 inch mixer, as well as two turntables.... normal seated postion. (not battle style)This foldout stand is lightweight, but sturdy enough to hold my fully loaded coffin. The shelf is great to have, as I can store my extra cables, etc. sometimes I use it as a drink shelf ;)the handle is just as sturdy as the frame, and it is easy to carry around.The height is perfect enough, and I am 6'1.Great purchase, great price, and this product is great quality!"
1,1980 called and they want their dvd back,"This video is almost gross, it keeps showing nude statues of men and it was done very poorly in the 80s, i did all 5 days of abs and felt nothing, save your money and buy a Biggest Loser product."
2,"Well intended, but dated and out of focus","White is a great writer, no doubt about it, but it seems that the editors pushed a little too far to present a title that fits in the hullabaloo about mixing. The market is hungry for books on mixing and that may be the reason for this book to exist. Almost a third of this very small book is just a glossary, and almost half of it is about recording, not mixing. If we take the other third about automation off, we end up with almost no useful information. But it is Paul White, and everything that he talks about is right, but certainly not focused enough on the matter. To make matters worse, it was written in 2000, making it suffer from old age (eight years is a lot of time in mxing techniques)."
3,Not the holly grial,"Well, I find that this book is really easy to read, and it probably is a good book if you know little about mixing, but to someone who has some knowledge on the subject, almost everything will sound familiar (at least). Also, if you're looking for a ""cookbook"" go find some other book, as this one hasn't fast and hard mixing rules.Overall, it's a good book, but after reading so many positive reviews, I was expecting something else..."
3,The Skedaddler,"Charley Quinn is a drummer boy for the Union army during the Civil War .He ran away from home to join the army and be like his older brother, never in his wildest dreams could he have thought fighting in a war could be so hard.On Charleys' very first battle, he sees all his friends, enemies, men, fall before his very eyes.

He runs away from the battlefield, sleeping in the day and running at night, Charley wants to get as far away from the war as possible, because the punishment is death.On his journey, Charley encounters both friends and enemies. But, Charley keeps his hope. Will he get back home? Will he get caught? Will he survive? Find out in Charley Skedadle!6 Grade Student from OHES"
2,Don't bother if you already have the 2nd edition,"I very much liked the 2nd edition of this text. I purchased the 3rd edition because we are planning our third trip to Jamaica. Unfortunately, this new edition contains very little updated information. In fact, two of the newer Riu hotels in Negril (one of which opened in 2001) are not even included in this guide.This is a very helpful guidebook, but don't bother buying the new edition if you already have the 2nd edition. You can find as much useful information online."
1,Not Worth It,"A fairly useless guide, with many facts but no feeling. Everyone knows their own expectations of Jamaica. This book does not address this at all."
5,my own personal spaceship,"What a fun way to learn about our solar system through beautiful graphics and a charming storyline. The accompanying CD-ROM is packed with interactive games and activities that make ""learning"" an addictive and exciting experience.The perfect book for all of those children who say, ""I wanna grow up to become an astronaut!"""
1,crap,would not cue a piece of glass in a straight line longer than 1.2 inches! Kept breaking the glass off. As a glass artist and with the price of glass this is not acceptable
4,wow!,"I loved this book because when I would worry about things happening to me at school, like falling down the stairs and other embarrassing things, I would pick up this book and after I finished it I felt much better! I suggest this book to girls from the age of 8 to even 17!!"
1,"[Original Review] Good, but not great. [2nd Review] Avoid!","[Original Review] Why can't anyone make a decent VCR anymore? This was my second (and final) try to replace an older RCA that worked great and lasted forever. I found the Panasonic PV-VS4820 to be a mixed bag. The plusses are that it rewinds and fast-forwards very fast, and that it has good picture and sound, even in SLP mode. The minuses are that the motor is VERY loud, it is very expensive for what you get, and it has the worst-designed remote control I have ever seen. I am keeping it, but only because I am tired of shopping for a decent VCR.[Second review, just over a year later] Well, the VCR just stopped producing any sound output and stopped playing tapes, after less than a year and a half. I also own a Panasonic DVD player, with which I am pretty pleased, but this VCR is awful."
1,Chinese copy,Well well well. I own the same model I bought locally for $60 it works flawlessly and it beautiful. This one is not working right out of the box. Additionally it's different shade of brass and the dial printing is drastically different . I suspect a Chinese knockoff. So back it goes!
1,Apologetics and Science take a hit,"Wow! It is difficult to know where to start describing this book. Ham and colleagues have chosen to misrepresent and misinterpret much of modern science and the Bible. One can only imagine their true purpose in writing this book. It's too bad that this book will present many Christians with a false image of both God and science as it seeks to develop a new religion of ye-creationism. The scientific arguments in the book are designed to bolster a flawed apologetics and the authors are forced to twist both to fit their world-view. There is nothing in the Bible that agues against an old earth on which evolution has taken place. Ham and colleagues argue that the Bible places limits on what their God could or could not have done. Having said that, this book is a must read for anyone interested in understanding how religion can run amuck."
5,Excellence!!!,"It is not very often that you find a good book with excellent photos and captions along with how-to instructions that are second to none. Once you're done with this book, read it again and then go find his other superb books that he has authored. I don't know John Shaw personally, but I can tell you after reading all of his books several times, I have not found another photography book author who comes close to what he conveys in his books. If your interest is in nature photography, the small price of his books are well worth it."
5,Piano lovers will love this one.,"I don't normally write reviews, so this would tell you that it really hit me hard. I think that the music on this CD is wonderful, fresh and full of life. I love the ethnic quality. I bought his CD on line, and I am very happy to see that Amazon is now carrying it. What a great story. Honestly I can't say enough about this CD, I may have to buy another copy for my car!!"
1,cell batteries,"I ordered two of these batteries for my cell phone. It took longer than expected to arrive. I paid $3.99 a piece to have them delivered, you'd figure that I could get them in a timely manner. Also, these batteries do not hold a charge for very long. I am still having to recharge them at least twice a day. That is how my original battery was when I decided to replace them with these sorry batteries. I am not satisfied at all!!!!"
3,"Oh, come on","Everyone knows that crop circles are made by alien flatulence. Where's the footage of trumping extra-terrestrials? I paid good money for this, only to watch some beared Open University lecturer bleat on about mystical mind energy. Stuff and nonsense. Give me footage of a green skinned, boggle-eyed, hairless, stumpy monster emitting a fart of such power and resonance it changes pitch four times and knocks over 14 hectares of prime wheat any day."
4,Great set,"Great set. Love the extras. The only issue I had with the set, was Martin Sheen's Lee. It's was pretty bad. I haven't watched the extras yet but look forward to watching them."
2,It works--just barely,"I guess you get what you pay for. This charger works, but apparently not quite the way Sony Ericsson would like it to. When using this charger, my SE W300i often reports charging errors. This never happened with the original SE charger (which my dog ate, hence the new one)."
5,Quick OEM replacement!,"I bought a used truck and the 4wd was not working. I read online these Thermal Linear Actuators are VERY prone to go out. I checked the fuses and wiring and this was the problem so I ordered it. Installation took about 5 minutes using a pair of vice grips. The old one looked like crap. Direct fit for a 1992 GMC 3500 with the 7.4l 454 V8.I didnot even have to remove a skid plate!Now, my 4wd works perfect! Plus, it comes with lifetime warranty! Can't go wrong!"
3,broke in 2 months,"I bought a halti at PetSmart for my 41 pound boxer mix. It did work well and she finally would walk with me without pulling. She seemed comfortable wearing it although occasionally it would get caught on her foot or something and she would have a mild freak-out. I'd free her foot and we would be able to continue without a problem. Unfortunately one of the straps wore completely through at the spot where the metal ring was rubbing it. Extra unfortunate was the fact that it finally broke just as we were setting off for a hike in a park. So I had to use her regular collar and she went right back to her old tricks again. I think I will see if PetSmart will allow an exchange, and if not maybe what I really need are some obedience classes so she can learn how to walk politely!"
5,Probably not the best; but worth the price,"I bought the wipes for about $9 and I would say it worth the money. This wipes away the sticky dirt; but, it won't completely got away. If I turn off my monitor and look at it closely; I can still notice the mark. However, for my general use, I never realized that the small dirt mark was still there. Overall it works pretty great for my 25"" LCD monitor. I spent $100 on my monitor; so, I don't want to spend too much for the monitor. If you got an expensive monitor and your eyes are very sensitive, then you might want to try another brand that has better review."
2,Boring.............,"I heard about these dvd's through some online friends and decided to go ahead and purchase them to try for myself. Let me say I am not totally out of shape but I have had 3 babies in the past 4 years and need some work losing about 10 pounds and something to get me energized. I tried the 1, 2 & 3 mile and find them incredibly boring. I didnt break a sweat and the moves are very very simple. I found myself thinking about all the other things I could be doing with my time. I think cleaning my house would have me burn more calories."
5,An Excellent Workout!,"I LOVE Walk Away the Pounds. I have never found a workout video I could stick with, but I've been going strong with these for a while now. I'm definitely seeing results. Leslie is very chatty, but I don't mind because she keeps me motivated to keep going. I would highly recommend this set. I look forward to exercising everyday now!"
3,Does she EVER stop talking,"I don't mind this DVD, but I have to ask, does Leslie EVER STOP TALKING??!?!???!?!! She insists on babbling through every second of the dvd. It would be ok if it was encouraging babble, but most of it is just her selling the walk away the pounds videos and other gadgets. As far as workout, I do the 3 mile sometimes when I don't have energy to do a full fledged aerobic workout...but the other two are too slow and don't get the heart-rate up."
5,"Great Film, Great Music, Great Mixes!!!","I love this movie and I'm so glad it's nominated for 4 academy awards! I got the soundtrack and loved it, but these remixes are soo cool that since I've got this album of remixes I listen to it much more than orignal sountrack. Especially good are the first and last tracks by Drum Magick, but the album is so solid and consistent that everything is great! For fans of both the film and Brazillian Electronica, this album is a must have!"
4,a good solid Regency,"Poor Felicia Simmons. Since her father's illness, the family has fallen on hard times. But that doesn't stop her from feeding every orphan who comes by, or from trying to provide for her household of misfit servants. Felicia gets by with her music lessons. At first, when Sir Christopher Wilde moves in across the street, he scarcely notices her. But circumstances put them in each other's company, and he begins to admire her kindness and grace. When a fairy godmother in the form of her scatter-brained godmother intervenes, the romance begins to bloom. I enjoyed this book. It is the second in a series, and before I got a chance to read the next, they were out of print! But if you can find a copy of this one, I recommend it."
5,Let's scare Christopher Lee to death,"This is an excellent version of the old Sherlock Holmes tale. It doesn't follow the book exactly but most of the additions work. We must remember, in this day when the Holmes stories are revered by many as great literature, that the author, Arthur Conan Doyle, never really took them seriously, Despised the charactor, Sherlock Holmes, and tried to kill him off at the earliest opportunity.So regarding the film as a story loosely based on the short story it comes off as excellent entertainment.Also worth the price is the commentary by Christopher Lee, describing his part in the making of the movie and the reading of the introductory chapter of the story, also by Mr Lee.Lee and Cushing make up one of the great teams in English Melodrama. The commentaries in this disk give us a short but interesting glimpse of their real characters, from Mr Lees fear of spiders to mr Cushings love of cartoon characters."
1,full of baloney,"Dr. Friel panders books and ideas as a business, and not as a means for truly helping his clients. ""The world according to Friel"" could be the title for all of his books.It's all fuzzy feel-good that boils down to ""woman good, man bad"".Seek real help elsewhere from someone that without this bias.."
3,Not rugged enough for serious use.,"While the print quality is great, this printer is not economical. A person is likley to spend as much on HP ink cartridges each year as they do on the printer's purchase price. Further, this printer has an electronic glitch that renders it lifeless, apparently just about when the warranty expires. This means that you might expect to replace the printer every year (I have owned 2 and a colleague has gone through 1 as well). Therefore, if you use this printer to just half of its stated limits (like 2500 pages per month), you might need to discontinue annual contribtions to your IRA in order to fund this money hungry beast. I must find another solution. A good printer for casual users only."
1,Cheaper elsewhere!,"GREAT PRODUCT, but please check the company's website because it is being sold directly from there for HALF the prices listed on Amazon!!"
2,Fell apart,"Looks great, does not hold up well. Fell apart inside and out. The leather stuck to me furniture. Pass on this one."
1,Fell apart inside and out,"Looks great, but does not hold up. It fell apart, inside and out, plus it stuck to my furniture. Pass."
5,"The perfect solution. Condensed my 1,000+ DVD collection down about 90% by removing the cases.",I love the sturdy build and the fact that it has a separate pocket in front for the paper cover and a separate soft cloth pocket for the DVD behind it.
5,Billy Elliot Soundtrack From the Original Motion Picture,Billy Elliot (2000 Film)WOW ! ! !What an incredible Album! It was worth every penny!
2,Boring and oh so Long,"This Movie could not decide whether it wanted to be a comedy or a war Drama. William Holden was wasted in this film, and the rest of the cast were just going trough the motions. Corny and Cheesy. Oh yeah also Stupid."
5,Works great!,Great magnifying glass. Very bright LED light. This is the second one I have bought for the recipient. She can now keep one upstairs and downstairs.
4,Needs a bit of tweaking,"The rectangle view is certainly ideal for reading typed print. However, one aspect is very deficient - since any magnifier is mostly for those with difficulty seeing the on-off light switch should be (A) larger and (B) colored. A daub of red finger nail polish remedied the 2nd problem, but the even then the switch is now a very tiny red spot. Also a small green LED light opposite the light side would be a reminder that the light is on. There is no remedy to the problem of replacing the tiny batteries. Someone who is truly sighted will have to do that."
1,Avoid this item,"The magnifier part of this product works once you accept the fact that it was designed for right handed people. My major complaint is with the lighted part. Instead of an LED the person who designed this product actually used an incandescent flashlight type bulb, the reason behind this design completely escapes me. Not only does this mean that the light produced is very weak compared to an LED but also the the bulb is far more fragile and will need to be replaced far more often.If you, like myself, are looking for a lighted magnifier that produces a bright, white light then give this one a miss."
1,The light went out within 2 months,I'm disappoint in this product because I reed on the light to read and it went dead on me in two months. Buy something else.
3,A Bit Less Moisturizing than previous formula,"I've used Kiss My Face liquid moisturizing soap as a hand soap everywhere in my house for several years, but this new formula seems less moisturizing. I wash my hands and forearms a lot because of my work. The previous formula always left my skin in great condition. After using the new product for a week, my skin is more dry. Also the new style of pump (and/or a thinner soap consistency?) cause the soap to overshoot my hand sometimes, splattering on the floor or wall. But the main issue is I'm not pleased that the soap seems less moisturizing. The previous product was perfect. I wish it were still available. Now I have to go looking for another brand that does the same moisturizing job as the previous Kiss My Face formula did."
5,confused,i did not know there was a book i saw the movie and it was excellent but at first kinda stupid i hope there will be another book and moving coming
2,really not a better sequal,darren is getting more stupid. the charm of the first book is gone. dont bother with the third book. it is even worse. darren is just a simple idiot!
5,Exactly what it's meant to be,"I would actually give it 4.5 stars because I wish the back supporting part had a wider range. But overall, the product is exactly what it claims to be and is pretty sturdy and easy to put together. The cable management is a plus."
3,Not for MacBook Pros,"This is a good laptop riser - solidly built with plenty of non-skid rubber to keep it in place. My office got me one for my MacBook Pro but unfortunately it's not quite compatible. Even though it's adjustable, it's not adjustable enough to get the screen verticle when the laptop is open all the way (since MBP's have a more limited hinge than most PC laptops). Therefore, I need to prop the bottom of it up on part of the box the riser came in, so the whole front of the non-skid rubber is resting on the box instead of the desk.Also, if you put a MBP on the riser while closed, the riser's front ledge blocks the open button, so I have to make sure I've opened it BEFORE I put it on the riser.In short, it's a decent enough riser, but I'm going to probably have to get a MBP specific riser out of my own pocket at some point instead."
4,Does what it is designed to do,"We purchased this to turn a 17"" laptop into a desktop unit. It works great and is designed well. Could be a bit heavier but it is totally adjustable and sturdy enough if you are not going to be moving the laptop around a lot. 3M does not make junk. I looked at other brands and designs, even bought one that I returned to the store. This was the best."
5,Vcr,This is the best vcr i have ever had. From its six heads it has crisp pauses. Its sound is great. For the price it is WELL worth it. What else is there to say? but that it is the BEST out ANYWERE!
1,Lack Of Details,"I have been shopping for a coupe of VCR s with SVHS capability.Amazon does not mention if any of thier VCRs have this capability, even under technical details (which offers very little details of anything.) This is probably the most important feature in buying a new VCR, but is ignored by Amazon. Evenet though there is a space for SVHS capability on the comparison list, it is not filled in - and since there seems to be no way to email them i've placed it on a review."
1,A book for dummies,I'm greatly disappointed with this book.The subtitle of this book is 'Mental and strategic tips for your best game.' But half of the book is about the 'outer game' (physical game). Though the chapters/headlines sound really good and interesting there is nothing new or unique in the writing.27 out of 294 pages (9%) of this book are blank (like publisher's brain?).
3,Decent,"I like Daniel Tosh and his comedy style. There area few reasons why I give this 3 stars and state that it is decent. First, the DVD video quality is poor at best. It is of his Comedy Central Presents half hour (~21 minutes without commercials) stand-up special. The video looks like a really bad VHS copy of a copy that was ported to DVD. Comedy Central dropped the ball on this one. Second, the jokes in this set, although good, are 90-95% the same as the jokes on his DVD Completely Serious. The video quality on that is 10 times better. My suggestion to those who enjoy Daniel Tosh's comedy is to not waste your money on this set. Instead, I suggest buying Daniel Tosh's Completely Serious and Happy Thoughts. You'll be glad that you did that instead."
5,Can't believe I found this!!,"I watched this video (on vhs obviously) in about 1995.... and it was HILARIOUS. My friends and I used to act out parts of it because the acting is SO HORRIBLE. I mean, I will give credit where its due... it's a great educational reproduction of Charlemagne but its also quite funny... the acting is , well, interesting.Either way I'm glad its there and it will be fun to watch with my friends if I can convince them to shell out this much money for a dvd. Seems a bit rediculous for $60. How many sales can you possibly get ? How's about lowering the price a bit?"
4,Interesting to someone who knows nothing about Paganism,"I found this book very interesting. I've read occult books here and there but decided to read this one day. I liked it. It held my attention. I can't comment on the Pagan side of things but I can comment on the science and religious side. There are errors, rather there are ""misinterpretations"" from their side when they are trying to make a point. I found that particularly disturbing. Not all of it was incorrect but there was some."
5,Wonderful!,"We got this book out of the library, and my 15 month old makes me read it over and over again. The pictures are great, the simple language is appealing, and the story is fun. It is at the top of his wish list!"
5,Core Buildups : Practical Preparation for Abutment Teeth (De,"Core Buildups : Practical Preparation for Abutment Teeth (Dental Technique Series, Vol 7)."
1,A disappointment,"Reading the title and description of this book, I was excited about reading it. I found the writing not up to the task! Despite having a great deal of interest in the subject, after scanning the book I decided not to read it."
4,Heady!,"Professor Hecht's tome is not light reading, but it is satisfying and worth the effort. I was somewhat amazed that one so young could plumb some pretty profound depths, and that with agility. Her acumen and scholarship are well-honed and her writing style is engaging. The experience is somewhat like looking through a looking glass, i.e., from the perspective of why ought one believe something as opposed to why one should do so. This is not another athiest rant. Rather, it is a seasoned overview of some of our species' best and most reflective thinkers who dared to doubt."
2,Can't get the most important thing right,"This isn't a complicated product. Put the glass tube into the holder and wait for it to rain. Pull the tube out when you want to know how much it rained. Look at the water inside, match it up to the lines and numbers painted on the outside of the tube, and voila, you have your answer. But wait, you don't have your answer, because the lines and numbers that you're looking for have worn off. After just a few weeks of use. In mild California weather.To their credit the manufacturer has agreed to replace the tube, sight unseen, but that only tells me that they are aware there is a problem. A little quality control and product testing would have avoided the hassle for me and them. For that reason I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Very nice,"High quality work, it was just what I was looking for. I am hoping this piece will last longer then the last two made from plastic."
2,Paint is immediately coming off glass...give me a break!,"I purchased one of these exact rain gauges about 5 years ago. If I had not left the glass in over winter this year I would still have it. I needed the new glass only, however it was less money to order the whole unit with another item and get free shipping. Nice brass piece, however in less than two weeks the paint is flaking off the glass tube. Give me a break! That is the most important part. The old glass had what appeared to be baked on mearsurments and made it through almost 5 years, this is just paint - bet ya' done in China now to save a few cents. I woud return this, but not worth the money. Don't waste your money like I did. Cheap parts like this loose customers.....I'll have to figure out how to fix before all the marking are gone. I won't even bother to get just the glass from this company as I am sure it is the same junk!"
3,Help me out here,"I would really like to order this item, but I am having a hell of a hard time figuring out how to order a certain length and color."
1,Picture Can't Handle Movement Like The Version: M,"I downloaded my movie to the Zen: W and when I played it the rendering of any fast movement was more annoying. Watching this felt like the effect of being in a haunted house with a stroblight wacking out your eyes ability to comprhend what's really going on. One of the earlier review shyly mentioned this, but to me was a big no no. To be fair I'm used to Zen's: M, though smaller doesn't have a big of an issue with movement and brighter, richer colors."
4,So many uses. So much fun.,"Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far).Yes, it plays and sorts your photos.Yes, it plays MP3s and sorts them by their ID3 tags (artist/genre/album/etc.).Yes, it comes with a good TV audio/video out cable (letting you use the Zen like a high-def digital video player).Yes, you can download your CompactFlash card directly onto the Zen hard drive.Yes, it syncs with your Outlook tasks and calendar. Wha? Yeah. It's hidden in there too. Along with an MP3 alarm clock.If you're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon, this is the multi-tool for you. Leave the laptop at home. The Zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music, movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you're unwired from the office."
2,A fantastic Player - 1 year ago,"When I purchased my zen over a year ago I thought it was the greatest thing out there. It had so much potential and the abilities is had were up there with the best.... and then Creative pretty much abandoned the product. There hasn't been a firmware upgrade in over a year, all the accessories that were supposed to come out never did. (No Docking station, no case, etc.) The problems with the interface that were promised to be fixed weren't and the product has just slowly become obsolete.I would look at some of the other players out there before purchasing this player and at least look to a product that is being supported and not just being sold."
1,Warning,"I bought this player a year ago, recently the screen got cracked. Creative will not repair. I was told to go to the online store and buy another one, yeah right. Buy an IPod, at least they can fix what they sell."
2,Not the same movie with Tom Wopat,This Meteorites 2 Pack is NOT the same as the movie that was shown on television! I bought this thinking it was the same movie I have been wanting to get even though it is not on DVD and I thought it was a good deal. This 2 Pack is two movies about meteorites which I haven't seen yet since this is not the movie I was wanting. I am not sure why it is saying it is the same as the movie that was on television and this is very misleading. So PLEASE be careful when you purchase this 2 Pack since you might get a surprise like I did.
5,great service as usual,I received my blower within quoted shipping time blower installed quickly and works just fine. It is identical to the original.
1,Dont Waste your Money.. It Does not work,I Bought it.. Inserted the batteries... which are not included.. And Voila..nothing happens...Makes for a Good Showpeice or Garbage. Depens how you prefer it..
1,Don't buy it!,Looks fun but in this case looks are deceiving.The rotors are so fragile they break just looking at them.You might get five minutes play time before the rotors break.Check out the prices of the rotors! I suggest cut your losses and run!
2,"Too painful to watch, and I ADORE MST3K","I've only encountered two MST 3K's in which the movie itself was so boring and painful to my eyes (literally) that I had to toss them (Hamlet is the other). I worship the MST Gods, and they did amazing work with what they had, but good god, this is only useful if you are teaching Film 101 at a community college and want to torture crappy students after class. This movie killed me. I tried to keep it. I know it is sacrilege to throw out an MST 3K, but I burned it and danced around the fire. I laughed."
2,Sheer Pain,"I love MST3K. The low rating is not a reflection on Mike and the bots. The fact is, this is the most painful MST film I have ever sat through. I could never describe how bad the plot(?) continuity is. It is so bad that Mike and the Bots have a hard time making it funny. It is also an episode from the early Mike era before he hit his stride. This does not help matters. This episode just hurts. Coleman Francis, ouch."
5,i can't tell which is better--the movie or the episode,"this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever. all of coleman francis' movies are pure bad movie genius. plus mike and the bots were in top form all through the 6th season and especially on this episode. watch it at least 10 times. if you don't think it's the funniest thing you've ever seen, then you have deep problems to deal with."
5,Woman's Guide to Firearms,"Don't let the title fool you. This is an essential addition to ANY household that keeps or is entertaining the idea of getting a firearm. Gives functional information about using and keeping guns, as well as marksmanship fundamentals and gun safety. Whether your'e a man or a woman, this is a must-have!-Ed"
5,Classic animation!,"Classic animation though I don't remember it being so bad. Very basic to meet deadlines for Saturday morning cartoons back in the 60's. But still great nostalgia! Hey, didn't I hear these voices before? Like in Jonny Quest?"
4,Support Your Local Gunfighter / Support Your Local Sheriff (Double Feature),"Arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. James Garner and Walter Brennan are two favorite actors. Was surprised at the ""G"" rating; ""PG"" or ""PG-13"" would be more accurate. Funny movie."
5,some of the funniest comedy westerns ever made,"I love these movies, especially SYL Sheriff. They are both set in gold towns of the old west, a stranger rides into town (James Garner) makes friends with the town drunk, enchants the ladies and deals with the badguy. Good acting, great lines, humorous situations and the classic western themes that everyone loves make these 2 movies loads of fun. 2 thumbs up!"
4,Only the strong survive,"I did enjoy this book, but I couldn't give it the full rating. I'm a die-hard basketball fan and an Iverson fan at that, so just about everything Mr. Platt covered on Iverson I already knew. He was able to have access to Iverson, which is always a positive thing, because you can get the story directly from the source. He talks about Iverson's childhood, his high school career, which has been well-documented, his time at the University of Georgetown, and his time in the NBA. He also takes the time to talk about other pivotal events in Iverson's life. All in all, I was satisfied, but I'll still have to wait for the autobiography to be fully blown away."
5,Great book for learning body parts,"My 17 month old twin girls love this book! They learned nose, toes, ears, and other body parts from this book. It is fun for them to play the game with Barney. And my favorite is that one of my daughters gives me a big hug when we get to the last page where Barney gives hugs."
5,a fulfilling adventure,"This story proved to be a fulfilling, satisfying, richly textured adventure. It takes some time to build, and Conan--rather uncharacteristically--bides his time, judiciously crafting appearances and manipulating relationships. Roberts turns less attention toward mirroring Howard's style and turns of speech than do other Conan pastiche authors, most notably Perry. Ultimately, the story constitutes a good addition to the Conan canon."
4,beach mouse pad,I am using my new mouse pad right now as I am typing my review nice size and pretty picture of the beach happy with it.
5,This rodent has a great pad,met all expectations...made with quality and should be durable. Perfect for a optical mouse! Beautiful island theme.Go get onequick.
5,A Great Box Set,"A great box set of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""! Consisting of four classic episodes, this set is a must for any fan! Buy it today!"
1,"Transmitter Fuse, 3 Amp Glass",This is not a toy...It's a fuseIt works fine.I use it for the amplifier that I have for my surround sound.
3,She likes it.,"It's a rain gauge. I was sorry it is not made in Vermont. She likes it just fine and it looks good in the garden.But...gentle readers, the glass tube is fragile, and I need somebody's help.Can somebody who recently bought this post the info on the package for ordering new tubes?The tube lasted one year, and I am struggling to find info on the web about getting a new one. Or two.thank you all so much!"
2,This DVD just does not do the band justice...,"Let me begin by saying I am a HUGE fan of Cheap Trick, and I bought this DVD with the highest of hopes.Yes, the band and the songs are both GREAT.But the audio is terrible and the video is worse. Bad camera work, muddy sound. Not the reasons one purchases the DVD format.On the plus side, the commentary track is GREAT!But, the show is the reason I bought it, and the show was burried in bad production skills.Buy at your own risk."
3,Just OK,"I was expecting more information about a specific breed but the author gives less than a page per breed, it is a good book and somehow easy to read but I was expecting more."
4,this is worth your money,"Southern Isolation, is a nice southern depression band. not metal, not pop...just southern. The singer, Stephanie Opal, is the wife of the DOWN singer Phil Anselmo (hes also in that bandPanterA. ) The music sounds like Suicide Note Prt1, and the vocals sound like cheryl crow mixed with bif naked. The lyrics are great and the cd really takes you away from the world even if its only for four songs. This is great if you like southern music, metal or hell, just buy it, believe me no one'll be dissapointed...unless maybe you listen to lil bow wow and limp bizkit. well, if you know true music, you know this is a band who put effort into this. If you're a musician please buy this and see how this can inspire you, the music really reaches out. give it a spin."
1,Poorly fitting joints,"Yes, i knew it was only 12-inches going into the deal but there was not enough attention-to-detail which would have made it a ""keepsake"". Not of the quality I was looking for, so I returned it."
4,ouch my butt hurts!,"I did this tape yesterday, and my butt hurts today!! (specially on the outer side of the butt).This tape is 47 minutes long, and it is a compilation of the best butt moves in the tae bo live volumes.If you don't have the live volumes 2-12 this video is definitely worth having, because it has lots of new kicks!It has the normal tae bo warm up, then moves to squats/lunges, then it is some side and back kicks, then moves to the mat exercises after about 30 minutes of kicks.The mat exercises has some funky editing at the beginning, you're on the floor then it is edited to where you are standing up doing plies, then after 3 seconds it is edited to some more floor exercises.Besides that this tape is great! it is long enough, you don't need an entire hour to work on your butt!!!The only part that i dont like is that funky editing and for some kicks it is only done on 1 side! (and thats for 2 different sets).But for the rest, this will definitely workout and shape your bum!!"
4,Good vise,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and finish. A very good buy at the price.Be sure to lube with a good quality grease.
