2,Boring,"I did not like this movie at all. Dont watch it. Also, the sound track isent Neil youngs best either."
1,This movie was garbage but johnny depp was'ent,The movie that really sucked it was so pointless and was boring in the first 5 minutes were Johnny Depp looks out a train window for 10 mins.Johnny Depps performance was good as he is in every movie but the story was horrible and the picture even worst.If your a johnny depp fan u would buy it or watch just to keep in your collection but ust keep the wrapper because its just a waste of time watching this trash movie.Buy something better like fight club or blow
4,Dead Man,"Johnny Depp. I have never been disappointed by Johnny Depp on the screen. Not an action packed thriller, but if you don't ""PAUSE"" before leaving the room and don't rewind you'll miss something."
1,Dead Man,"I cant believe I bought this movie, it stunk so bad I had to fumigate my DVD player. If this a classic, then your reviers are brain dead. This ones realy bad bad bad."
4,More like 3 and 1/2,"I liked the movie somewhat, but it seems to me that it could not decide weather it wanted to be a comedy, a tragedy or some kind of tribute to Stanley Kubrick. Some parts were incredibly funny, others just made absolutely no sense at all. If SOME of the melodramatic moments were taken out it would have been fine. I think everything was overplayed just a little bit. For example the ""got any tobacco"" line really got old quick. Other gags got old quick to like the guy who just talked all the time. In the end there is no real resolution and the viewing audience is just left hanging.Overall-Not horrible just a little to introspective for my tastes. It was like everyone associated with the project had a clear eye on what they wanted the movie to say in the beginning and then they just forgot about it."
4,Dead Man,"I found this movie dark, moving and full of symbolisms. Look beneath the surface and it is quite interesting. However, the guitar soundtrack, I felt, did not fit the mood of the film and in fact was quite distracting and, I must say downright annoying. If the sound track could be deleted it would improve the film immeasurably"
2,Disapointed,"Odered one for myself and one for my wife. After 2 winters of usethe the lining started peeling around the collar. Now after 3 winters it runs across both shoulders. We both wear them when we ride our Harley. With all that wind the fabrics has held up great. I just wished the waterproof layer did as well. If you are very active your water barrier might also fail. I guess I still have a good windbreaker, although in the Pacific Northwest you need it to be waterproof."
2,"Rushed, fumbled and crippled.","This is a mediocre phone, made nearly useless by Verizon.PROS:- Great speakerphone- Very slim and pretty- The phone part of the KRZR, is decent.CONS:- Menu is not intuitive and has a very long lag between different menu screens- Takes forever to start up the text message screen- Almost 15 seconds and 6 clicks to open up your MP3 player.- MP3 player unusable because it's very tricky to get MP3s on the phone and there's no headphone jack. The USB-to-2.5mm adapter that comes with the phone is pointless since all headphones are 3.5mm.- Battery dies in a year, so be ready to purchase at least one more if you're like me and have a 2-year contract- Verizon disables almost all bluetooth profiles...no free pictures, ringtones, games, videos or internet.- The mobile internet is obsolete. You pay 5 bucks a month to access tiny WAP portal loaded with Verizon ads.I will never get another MOTO phone and I'm leaving Verizon right after my contract is up. Bring on the iPhone."
1,not impressed,"The real world fights dvd wasn't much to impress me, there is 4 or 5 fights in it; and it didnt really hold my attention. It's kinda like those movies that are drawn out and you just get bored of them."
1,one star too many,"Pricelss footage of the great bandleader and early R&B pioneer is sorely hindered by an audio track way far out of sync. And not just on one track, but all the way through the disc!! E-mails to the distributor, Navarre Corp., not even acknowledged. Save your money."
1,Doesn't work properly,"The reader did not read the card; instead it kept prompting me to format the card which would have destroyed the data. I bought a Sandisk MicroMate SD / SDHC Memory Card Reader that works perfectly. It read the same card without prompting me to reformat. It cost about $6,but the Sandisk reader works, this one doesn't."
4,Good product,It took a while to get to me but the product arrived and worked well on my SD cards for Digital Cameras.
3,disappointed!...,The fact that I could see JMJ performing is even amazing. However it was hard for me to feel a real concert feel from this dvd. The sound quality is good but the vision is disappointing. I felt like this was rather a movie or documentary than a concert. The camera angle is not precise and do not expect you can see him performing accurately. I saw this dvd only one time fully and now I'm forgetting the existence of it. I do hope I could get a real good (concert) dvd of JMJ before long.
4,My Opinion,"The story is about a girl, Lisa, and her brother Todd. Their family died and the two and others were forced to survive by themselves. I have some questions. What did happen to those dead bodies that were all killed by a virus? The end of the book leaves the reader up in the air. It would be nice if there was a sequel."
5,A stick with you story with a good message,"A must read for every kid in the 9-15 age group. I'm 29 and read this over 15 years ago, but the story still sticks with me. (I may have even learned from it.) The book leaves you thinking ""What would I do?"" It's a real imagination perker, but at the same time it teaches values and leadership. Though published over 20 years ago, it's timeless and may seem even more real as we approach 2000."
4,Lisa's World,"I thought The Girl Who Owned A City was an awesome book, one of the best I have read. It had some cool parts in it. My favorite part was when Lisa punched the commander of the other army. It was hilarious. One bad part was when the book suddenly ended. The author should write a sequel to this book."
4,The Girl who owned a city- a great example of leadership!,"This book was very good. But like all other books, it had it's faults. I think that there was too much violence in the story! I think Nelson did this because since the star of the book is a girl, by creating so much violence it would keep boys's attention. In my class it did for the boys, but the girls didn't like it as much( including myself). I think that the girl who owned a city was well written,but at the end the author just left you hanging! It didn't explain anything about what happened to the city. I give this book four stars because of the continous acts of violene and the unfinished ending. Overall I liked the book very much!"
3,Only Children,"This book is about children who have to survive in a world without adults. It's about a girl named Lisa who forms a militia to survive from gangs in the streets.I think this book was boring at first, but then it got better as I continued reading the book."
1,"terrible book, would have given it 0 stars if possible","[...]Of all the books/short stories I have read in my life,(around 600 in all) this makes it on my WORST top ten list. I mean get real. This book is about a 10- year-old girl who lives in a small village of orphans because everybody over 12 is dead. She gets the idea to create a militia, and the next thing you know she finds a car and in about 5 minutes she is an expert on driving it. After a while, she makes a fortress out of the old highschool and everybody is happy. Not quite. Within a year the fortress is taken over by a ""gang""(10 year old kids traviling in groups) Lisa, the girl, is shot and another 10-year-old girl gives her surgery and succefully takes out the bulet without hurting Lisa. Then she forces her brother to cross dress and spy on the gang leader. In the end, everyone lives happily ever after. I mean: What a lame book!!!!!, you might as well read somthing like ""BATTLE FIELD EARTH"", or ""HARTS HOPE""."
4,I can't help feeling scared...,"When I read this as I kid I would try to place myself inside it thinking about all the people that I know who would be dead or alive thanks to that virus. I was about eight or nine when I read this. Now I'm fifteen, scary thoughts.Anyway i've always loved this book and for a long time I had forgotten about it. We had read it in gradeschool so when it came up on my recomedation's list I recognized the title. That happens alot, strange. I love this book and still remember most of the story even though i've only read it once and that was... what? seven years ago? It's a really great story and it gets a person thinking about things like that. I'm mean think about it how would you handle being in a destroyed world ruleing over like 150 kids all 12 and under. Every grown up you've ever loved and respected gone from you forever? I'd freak.Still a good story though."
3,snail mail?,$3.75 to send it snail mail? Really? I sure hope it's more than a penny whistle when it gets here.
2,Looks great after adjustments... wasn't an OEM fit for my '05 T4R,"I have a 2005 SR5 4Runner I installed this on and it was not a glove fit with my grille and hood. The bugshield creating too much space between the grille and hood for the fasteners to tighten again. I had to use Loctite to make the fasteners stay put and by the time evreything was put back together the hood and grille weren't flush. Also, because of some pressure the deflector was having from a lip under the hood, the middle of the bugflector bowed down and looked weird. I got a heat gun and molded the bugflector's lip to have a flat and consistent look across the front. After all is said and done, it looks awesome. However it was a huge pain to get installed. This is advertised as working for 03-05 4runners. It did not have a glove fit to my '05 SR5 4runner..."
1,Absolutely horrid excuse for a publication!,"This ""book"" (and I use the term VERY loosely) is a waste of money and paper. The 32 pages are filled with almost oversized print so there really isn't as much actual information here as there could have been (and the paltry 10 pictures takes up most of those pages). Oh, and the ""32 pages"" they are counting includes the index! This is also not written at a high school reading level as stated either, most of it is written about 2 grade levels above ""See Jane run!"" The high school age family member that I purchased it for was EXTREMELY disappointed in the quality, format, content, and overall presentation of this subpar publication. I give it a D-, not an F, just because the pictures are clear."
2,Not really what i expected,"The call is barely raspy and very high pitched for a duck call, it just sits on a shelf not neing used."
5,Great for visually impaired.,My mother is visually impaired and at 80 years old a little forgetful on what day it is. This little gaget helps her remember the day and also the time.
3,Many questions a DPE could ask,This practice guide has many questions in regards to the oral portion of the rotorcraft helicopter practical test. I studied mine as much as possible before my exam. The oral for me went very well I cannot say the same for the actual flight check. This is a helpful book for preparing for any of the rotorcraft helicopter oral portion of the practical test.
5,Perfect color!,Lancome presents a wonderful product that feels so good after putting it on! The best part is that the colors look so beautiful on you!!
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"The easiest way to know how much I've used this book over the years is simply to flip through the pages. There are very few that haven't been splattered or stained by spills at some point. Beyond the utility of the book as a collection of recipes though is the wealth of history, personal reflection, and sheer joy found in Mr. Neal's writing."
1,Angel Force,Not satisfied.THE VHS did not come to me in mint condition as stated.This movie has snowflakes; can't view movie clearly. I have DVD;wanted the 80s;90s angel force.Not the same movie.It will take more in postage to return it.Not worth it. I hope to find the Ninja warriors movie Angel Force.(adults only)
1,cheap!,Too expensive for the cheaply manufactured product. Mine arrived damaged in pieces. Too small and hard to find replacement bulbs.
4,almost didn't buy it - sooooo glad I did!,"I had originally decided not to buy this tape because although we LOVE the other Joe Scruggs tape (Deep in the Jungle) all the reviews of this tape on Amazon. com tore it apart (where did all those reviews go anyway - I can't find them anymore) My almost 3 and almost 5 year old thoroughly enjoy all the Joe Scrugg CD's - the music and lyrics are so original and fun! We finally decided to take our chance on this video and it's GREAT! If your kids already know the words to the songs, it's so exciting to see them animated on video. (everything is done in a cartoon form) In some cases, like the goo goo ga ga song, it actually works better in animation form, than it does in the Live in Concert format. For Joe Scruggs music fans, my husband and I definitely recommend this tape. We all couldn't take our eyes off it until it ended!"
3,bic board,"i have surfed on this board to try it out for my shop. i would recomend it to begginers because it has alot of float but is still more manuverable than a longboard. i would not recomend this to anyone who is intermediate or above, because of the float. this board never goes underwater. you can not oduckdive or anything. i found it hard to get out in big waves because the thing floats like a lifejacket. this or any other bic board is good for begginers but noone else."
3,good board. you get what you pay for,"This as well as other BICs are extremely durable. Selling them as new or renting them, I've seen them withstand serious beatings. They're well worth the money if you plan on learning and passing it on to a friend or family member. These aren't high performance however, and slightly heavier than other boards."
3,Pool Toy,"This board looks like something you could buy at wal-mart for the kids to play with in the pool, I bought one as my first board for the cold waters of gloucester MA because i knew i'd hardly ever use it annd there are no surf shops in that area. when i did find a shop with boards they were upwards of $600I now live in Huntington Beach CA, and I feel as if I'd get beat up if i dragged that board to the beach. HOWEVER.......I now call it the ""unbreakable loaner board"" and let my friends use it when they come here on vacation, it floats great, and is rather heavy which makes it super easy to stand up on, Its a great board to learn on if you dont mind being ridiculed by other surfers. its not worth 300 dollars though. ESPECIALLY not when you can get a used Merrick @ play it again sports for like 150 bucks"
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!,"If you're buying this, you're a kook!For the safety of others, please do not go into the ocean."
3,Not seeing the forest for the trees,"I think this recording lacks the weight and drama one expects to feel when listening to the ""Fantastique"". Everything is extremely light and, dare I say, passionless. And this is not the fault of period instruments - Gardiner and ORR have shown the tormented and even devilish power of this music in an unforgettable manner.On the other hand, the sound is really exquisite and detailed; one has the impression that sir Roger Norrington has rehearsed the orchestra in a note by note basis, explaining to the musicians exactly how one should play each note. However, I think this approach just doesn't work with a work like this.In short, this recording is like not seeing the forest for the trees. The notes are all in place and is very well recorded wo you can listen to each one of them, but the set lacks power and drama. But it's a useful recording to music students, as it is very detailed it helps to learn the musical structure of the work in details."
1,Creating No Value,Lame! Gives absolutely no useful information or interpretation. And it's absurdly overpriced. Not at all recommended for people not enrolled in Stuart Gilson's class. Amazon's description of the book gave no hint that it consists of scene setting followed by bare financial statements.
5,Speedloader,Excellent product. Extremely worth it.Works better than expected. Dealer was great to work with and shipping was fast.
3,not as good as hoped,I should have gone with my own judgement. The cylinder release prevents the speedloader from smoothly and completely placing the rounds in the cylinder on my Taurus 94. Doubt that any speedloader will do a great job. The product itself seems well made.
5,GREAT SPEED LOADER !,"This speed loader is perfect, works great, can't wait to add some of the other calibers to my collection of hand guns."
3,"The material is good, but you may have seen it before","I am giving it three stars as a warning because of the fact that if you have ""The New American Splendor Anthology"" and ""American Splendor: The Life and Times of Harvey Pekar"" you will be wasting your money on this 86 pages of comics you have mostly seen before. And those other two are a much better deal for the money. This book is only good if you want a collection of exclusively Crumb's stuff. You can think of this as being Crumb's stuff drawn from those other two books. Get the other two books instead, unless you love Crumb and hate the other artists."
5,like with your own eyes,"This is the kind of guide you need when preparing a trip; here's everything you need to know before arriving to Tuscany.How do I go? Where can I stay? What should I see? How can I spend my time? What's the tipical food? And the best wine?With this guide, you learn about the places to visit through photos, maps with suggested itineraries, all kinds of tips and very thorough descriptions. It's different from other guides because it's a visual guide; you can actually see what they are talking about. It's easy to follow, funny to read and useful to take with you on your trips."
3,Too much Tuscany?,"The travel sections of most bookstores, particularly the larger ones, are awash in books about Italy, and in particular, the region of Tuscany. This is clearly too much of a good thing; take 10 of these books----and there must be closer to 20 of them----and you will find much duplication. How is a traveler, particularly the first-time traveler to central Italy, to know which guides are helpful and which merely rehash information that has been available for many years? One of the problems is that many of the guides issue a new edition each year in an apparent attempt to render last year's guide obsolete. Nonsense! I have some travel guides that are 15 years old and are still valuable. Keep in mind that the Etruscans were in Tuscany well over 2,000 years ago; their monuments and culture is not going to change much between 2007 and 2008.In short, this book serves a purpose but so do many others with similar titles."
2,Uninspiring,"I have read all the Castaneda books. The knowledge that he has imparted is unquestionably unique. Who is to know what the truth is? Can we really say we know the man we didn't know? I found the book 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' quite uninspiring. The narrative was fear based and negative. For all those Castaneda lovers I would recommend to focus on 'Journey to Ixlan', 'The Active Side of Infinity' and 'The Art of Stalking Parallel Perception' by Lujan Matus. 'The Sorcerer's Crossing' and 'Being in Dreaming' are the books that beckoned the most sobriety in me. 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' lacks the depth and heart of the warriors way."
4,reality check,"Allow me to put my two cents in on this. When I was younger, I read several of Castaneda's books, and they made a big impression on me. They were, and remain, terrific books. Beautiful and poetic. Having said that, when I read Amy Wallace's tell-all about CC and his groupies/followers, it was not a flattering portrait of a supposedly enlightened man. I've read the other reviews of this book smearing Ms. Wallace as ""psychotic"" and otherwise. This is typical character assassination of someone who had the courage to blow the whistle on a cult that was horribly cruel towards its members with Castaneda in the background, manipulating people and encouraging their antisocial behavior. As for the book itself, it's compulsively readable, but I also found the mind games and nonstop abuse to be very depressing."
2,Poor Amy,"Even when Florinda tells her to smile, Amy can't do it. Such a simple thing but Amy can't do it. Instead she diverts her energy onto blaming Florinda for being a bad teacher. The whole book encapsulated in that moment."
3,Kitschy Brazilian jazz vocals,"This foursome updates the glitzy, acrobatic harmony vocal style of the 1960s female group, Quarteto Em Cy, with perky, bouncily arranged versions of songs by Djavan, Caetano Veloso and other Brazilian composers. If you like the old Q.Em Cy albums, or American bands of a similar bent, such as Manhattan Transfer, you might enjoy this disc quite a bit."
1,suks,"this is just about the worst hair straightening/crimping/waving/etc. product that i have ever bought. do NOT buy this product, it's just a waste of your time and money!"
4,Works Great,Bought this small kettle for a travel trailer. It works as expected. What more can you say about a tea kettle?
3,..Chill Out C/J..It's just a compilation..!,"..Novice, purist..it's all good..have lot's of Blue Note/Pacific Recordings..I highly recommend the Verve Jazz Masters Collection as well..Get cha groove on..!..And after all, C.J. You can re-program the set and burn it the way YOU want to hear it.."
5,"Much more than a comic book, this is Orson Welles","High Society fully deserves the praise given to it by the other reviewers. The dramatic tension that builds in the closing section of the story equals anything I have read in straight literature or seen in plays or films. The scene of Cerebus' discovery that he possesed to one thing that could have assured his administration is extraordinary, followed immediately by the cut to the narrator scrawling the last word of text onto his cell wall it is breathtaking. Citizen Kane with better jokes."
3,Good But Shaky,"The picture is excellant, but very shaky. I don't really blame the cameraman, because it is the dancing in the stands (were he is photographing) that causes the shaking. The women are out of this world beautiful. Rio, I gotta get there."
4,Great book with great information,"This book has great information for understanding changes during perimenopause. It covers the wide range of symptoms women go through very well, and the information is scientifically based. It is a great balance of sound nutritional information, not too far on the holistic side, but full of natural solutions to various symptoms--great nutritional information! It is the best perimenopause book I have read. I definitely recommend it, and I have heard Pam Smith speak in person, and I agree with her advice."
1,Mine was faulty,"My screen turns yellow on a regular basis, I guess this was a faulty unit.When I get a chance I will probably send it back, in the meantime I have invested in a raritran switchman KVM switch, a much better value for money proposition."
2,Nice product but terrible screws,"The product works well if you can get it installed. It's uncomfortable enough to install this type of thing. Nothing is worse than when you finally get it aligned correctly and you start putting the screws in and the screw breaks. I had 6 screws break within the first 5 latches I installed. I had to stop what I was doing, drive to Home Depot and buy different screws. They are that bad. Don't even start installing until you have replaced the screws."
5,Excellent read. Gripping stuff! Action packed!,"A very compelling account and exciting book that I was unable to put it down. In the same league as Andy McNab's books. It clearly shows the rigorous SAS Selection and training process. Particularly realistic were his accounts of the grueling experiences in the Falklands and the scud destroying missions in Iraq. Reading this book makes you realize the tough conditions that these elite troops survive in. Thanks Mike, for doing a tough job well and for writing an excellent book about it all!"
2,"Bugs, typos, and errors","While the text of this book is very well written, I have never run across any book that contains as many errors as this one. While finding errors in code serves as a good programming exercise for beginning programmers, there is absolutely no excuse for the terrible editing in this book. As there are many very good beginning Visual Basic books available, I strongly advise potential buyers to look elsewhere."
2,This book could have been great.,"Good ideas, good examples, but so filled with mistakes it's almost comical. If you don't take the publisher's sloppiness too seriously, the book works. Even the errata sheet is pathetic. A real underachiever. Perhaps the ""Homer Simpson"" of programming books."
2,wont recommend it.,"I was happy using this product for the first couple of months. Then I noticed a small crack on my lens. I never thought that it would be from the cleaner until I started cleaning my other pair of glasses. I saw crack initiating almost from the same spot. It might be just my glass but am sure these kind of vibrations are capable of initiating (and later propogating)cracks at points of high stress concentrations. (You can ignore this last line, that was just my ME background talking :-))Now I am back to my cleaning swipes."
4,Home Adaptor Kit,"Aside from the fact that all the items in the home kit SHOULD ALREADY come in the Roady II kit, I can recommend this set. It's all you need to make your Roady II that much more capable. Also the antenna is strong.Delivery was fast, shipping was free, go with Amazon."
2,Predictable,"In his debut novel, Richard Aleas shows that he has learned his craft - he knows how to write the formula. Now what he needs to do is create more interesting characters and break up the formula enough to surprise his readers. The protagonist, John Blake, is a bit boring. He hasn't grown much emotionally in the ten years since he graduated from high school (for example, he's never had a serious relationship in all that time; he's still mooning for his high school sweetheart.) The ex-sweetheart, Miranda, apparently decided to ditch her plans to become a doctor and went on the road as a stripper instead because...(hint: it's not because she's deep.)The surprise twist in the plot has been done in other mysteries and it's a great device, but it's not much of a surprise here (everyone in my book club guessed it.)All in all, I'd characterize this book as ""workmanlike."" All the right elements are there, they've just been done better by more experienced writers."
4,A very through dictionary for German students,This dictionary is helping me a lot in preparation of German homework and classroom participation. It is organized with good examples of case and tense to save time and work. It is recommended.
3,Windsurfing in a Weekend Series,"For the elemetary beginner, this book is a good start before entering the water. However, land pictures don't provide enough visual help. Once you enter the water, this book will be shelfed. I would recommend a comprehensive book that would provide the instructions as the sailor's level progresses."
2,The Seasons Without Energy,"I couldn't agree with the previous review more. I read it prior to purchasing this CD and I should have taken its advice. It sounds like an attempt to take playful music and make it sound melancholy. I thought that ""October"" in particular would sound good because of what the previous review said, but that is not the case. Its just way too slow and dull..."
2,Not that great,I thought this would be a fun read but I was wrong. The story is slow and I didn't identify with any characters enough to care about the outcome. I feel like Marla was incredibly nosy and didn't like her at all. I don't think I'll be reading anything else from the series.
3,A little overdone,"I`m a big fan of Bava`s horror films (not of Lisa and the Devil and House of Exorcism) and thrillers and they look really beautiful on DVD but it would have been a great improvement, if the films would have been put together genrewise and not having to see such stinkers like Roy Colt or from Vol. 1 Knives of the Avenger which where boring me out of my mind. So next time you`re in to bring out a box about a master director concentrate on the good stuff and leave the waste behind."
5,Lamy 2000 taxus,"The pen is high quality and aesthetically pleasing. Good balance and light weight. Local stores were selling the pen at about double the price here. Shipping by World Lux was fantastic, the pen arrived at 10 am the next morning."
2,The American Way of Death,"It's a depressing book, the book was old and smelly and was really out dated. The author had a thing for doing in the mortuary industry, and perhaps when she wrote the book 40 years ago, it was true, but there have been reforms. I worked for two morticians and none of what she wrote about was true at either place.I only bought this because a professor suggested that we read it....bad suggestion!!!"
2,"Simply awful performance, but a good game","This is an add-on pack to MOHAA - which was a great game. The content of this expansion pack is great. Essentially more of the same. More missions, etc.However, the performance is so bad on this that I ended up quitting it and un-installing. My system is pretty fast, too (G4 tower, 867 mhz, 768 mb RAM).The first few levels are ok, but the performance issues keep getting worse and worse with every successive level until finally, it just grinds to a blurred halt (ardennes forest, winter, half-track).I've looked on the Web site for tech support or patches and haven't found a thing.As a result, I really would have to discourage people from buying this game unless you have a super-fast machine to run it on."
2,Frostbite at Ardennes,"As to the Wermacht, the weak point to this game is the snow, the Ardennes forest stage has no autosave feature and the quicksave doesnt work. Other snow bugs are:-1 out of 2 times planting the sticky bomb on the first battery of artillery stalls the game, forcing to quit.-The mountain top stage slows the game to a point can not be played at all. That happens even with the video and advanced options at minimum. Even playing in a 1 Gb RAM machine.The sound, the graphics, the play is superb, but dying from bugs is the worst thing can happen at any war, even a digital one.I would prefer to play this game in the PS2. The MOH Frontline is the best game I ever played. And I didnt find any bugs at all.(This information refers to the MAC version)"
5,"Nice little workhorse, good in any kitchen","If you do any amount of cooking, you have probably discovered that freshly ground pepper adds so much flavor to food, and that the preground pepper available in the supermarket adds about as much flavor as ground cardboard. Once you've made this discovery, you might want to consider this as a fine addition to your kitchen. It works well, has a choice of several different coarseness of grinds, and is small enough that the peppercorns don't go stale between fillings. It also looks pretty nice."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I bought the eGear LED Ear Light to read my Kindle at night, but I have discovered so many other uses for it that it almost lives on my ear. As soon as the sun goes down, I make sure I have my ear light with me. I think I may have to buy more and give them as birthday gifts this year!!"
3,It's Okay - not great.,It is ligher and brighter than the previous one that I had. But it uses specialty batteries that require a trip to Radio Shack......
4,AMUSING LITTLE COMEDY.,"Husband Fonda pushes his wife, Pons into a singing career. Although reluctant, she gives it her best shot, and becomes a great success. This sours Fonda, a struggling opera composer, so Pons uses her influence in order to get Henry's opera turned into a hit musical comedy... Once this is accomplished, Pons retires from the spotlights in order to raise a family. in Because MGM was successful in making Grace Moore a movie star, RKO wanted to follow suit with their contract player, French soprano Lily Pons: the result wasn't entirely in vain. This film featured up-and-coming 30 year-old Fonda in his first non-bucolic screen role. In the minor part of Gwendolyn Dilley (!) Lucy had her second featured-player role & 20 years later she would buy RKO studios!"
2,Product did not appear new,"The CD case was punctured when I received it and the CD had scratches on it. The item was listed as new, but didn't look like it."
2,"No Chemistry, No Spark","Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a chef in a upscale restaurant who is a total control freak. Her life is turned upside down when her sister dies in a car accident and she becomes sole guardian of her eight year old niece (Abigail Breslin). A new sous chef (Aaron Eckhart) is hired to help her out at the restaurant. She is upset because she feels this is done behind her back. Through all of this she is seeing a psychiatrist, paid by her boss, to help her sensitive nature. When the psychiatrist asks why she is seeing him, she replies ""I don't know, my boss is paying me to do this.""""No Reservations"" is a remake of the romantic comedy ""Mostly Martha"", but sadly, this remake is bland, no spark, predictable ending and overall disappointing."
5,Good Movie,"I have no complaints. It is a very good movie. It is pretty sad though. The acting is good, and it has a good atmosphere."
4,JazzMan51,"Wonderfully Entertaining. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Great ! Aaron Eckhart is a very good Actor, we should see more from him soon.Loved the plot and loved the chemistry. Great in HD."
3,experience with plumbing to go,"The product was not what we wanted so I emailed the supplier, plumbingtogo, that I was returning for a refund and instead of crediting they sent me another faucet. I also enclosed a note with the return and it didn't make a difference. It was over $13 to return the first and now he told me if I want a credit to return it again at another $13. It will cost me nearly $30 to return a product I don't want. The faucet was nice, it just wasn't the right color but the rest of the experience of shopping was not good. I have returned it another time and will wait again to see if I ever get a credit."
1,GARBAGE,"After being up past midnight last night trying to fix the diverter valve AGAIN (third time), and coupled with having to fix the soap dispenser TWICE and the handheld sprayer TWICE since I (regretfully) bought this, I can safely say this thing is an absolute piece of garbage. DO NOT BUY IT!!! YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY."
2,sprayer head issues,"The product looks great. However, we have a LOT of water pressure, so we have gone through TWO sprayer heads and currently need a third! It cracks on the seal. Perhaps with lower pressure it would be ok."
2,On our second one,"We have the Marielle and are on our second one. Our first leaked around the pivot after about six years of heavy use. Price Pfister replaced the entire faucet free of charge. I had to install it though. Our second one is now refusing to stay on when you want a small amound of flow. Full flow it works fine. We love it when it's working but I'm not sure about another Price Pfister. Follow-up: I did some google searching and found that you can remove the top trim pieces and tighten the large nylon ""nut"" which adds friction to the handle operation. This will keep the faucet from tuning off by itself. I'd say at least 4 stars now."
4,time piece,"I like it a lot and it keept very good time for the first 3 weeks that I had it, however, it has suddenly started to lose time. Not just a little, about 10 minutes a day. I'm hoping it's just in need of a battery."
3,The Magnificent Obsession,This is a book written by Anne Graham Lotz that is about the bible story of Abraham. She tries to read between the lines to interpet what Abraham was thinking and how his failures and his faith affected his relationship with God.She goes on to try to tie this in with how we can establish that same relationship with God.
5,"Fresh face, fresh mystery!","You don't need to know beans about biotechnology to enjoy this fast-paced romp through the shady side of science in Miami's backyard. The author did all the hard work and then made it easy for readers like me, who care more about the story than the scientific details, but still want a sense of authenticity in those details.Best of all is the hero in the story, Ben Candidi. He's fresh and convincing and altogether the kind of guy who you KNOW knows a lot more than you do, but would still make terrific company around the dinner table.Bottom line? It's comforting to know that not every Florida mystery needs to have an edge of hysteria in it to give readers bang for their buck. How refreshing!"
1,Useless,It looked as thought this had been sitting on a shelf for a few years. I would have returned it if I didn't need it right away. The can lasted less than one flush and ran out of propellant. It also leaked from the top of the can. I ended up flushing cheap ATF fluid through the line several times with an air compressor.
1,real memphis,"wots happened to memphis hiphop it goin out the window or its already gone out the window there pushin any old sh'' out for bucks anyone who is in2 real memphis years 94 to 98 2000 max when rappers were hungry no,s wot im talkin about old underground tapes the only guy doin stuff to that form now is evil pimp and thats a bit over the top but come on guys we want them simple murder beets back with them sik lyrics instead of that shoutin crunk sh,t 36 is now pushin,,,, get back to your roots alot of people are now reachin out for the old siccness from back in the day tommy wright playa fly kinda sh,t even koopstas devil playground piss,s on this wack sort your stall out koopsta"
3,It's a cartoon,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
1,Wrong series sent to me./ correcting problem,I ordered Legend of White Fang - Complete Series with Shane Meier and Nick Mancuso because I liked Call of the Wild so much. I was very upset when I opened it and it was the animated version. I would like to have not had the animated version and don't know how to get it made right. I have had confidence in Amazon but this purchase makes me a little leary of future purchases.Later:I have called Customer Service and they were very gracious and are replacing this animated version with the one I actually ordered. I appreciate their politeness and willingness to correct the situation and I am positive I will order from Amazon again.
3,legend of white fang,it is not as expected. not enough information given in your advertisement of it. did not state thatit was only cartoon animated
1,Gives independent films an even worse name.,"Look, to be honest I'd rather see another ""so hip it hurts"" Indie-wood annoyance by Tom DeCillo than a GENUINELY independent movie like TWEEK CITY. Why? Because A.) it's the same old junkie story 50 other similarly sterile and smug films like TWEEK CITY have already told, and B.) I'm tired of slogging my way through one well-meaning micro-budget street drama after another, when those involved don't seem to have a clue what they're talking about. I'd reccomend that the makers of this angst ridden torture session of a film look at martin Bell's STREETWISE or Lech Kowalski's STORY OF A JUNKIE before they take it upon themselves to portray drug addiction in another film. Supremely irritating and obnoxiously unconvincing. PS: the digital video is hideous."
3,Should have been an EP,"In a nutshell.... ""Crystal Ship,"" ""White Lines"" and ""Perfect Day"" are as good or better than the originals (and even Lou Reed agreed.) Hit the skip button on the rest."
4,A good album of quality covers.,"I don't really understand all the negative reviews by (especially) the british media. Sure, there's some needless fluff such as '911 is a joke', but tracks such as the funky and hip 'White Lines' + the lush and beautifully arranged and performed such as 'Perfect Day' have been endorsed by the original artists (Grandmaster Flash and Lou Reed respectively) themselves. Simon LeBon's vocals are also in fine form in offerings such as ""Lay Lady Lay"" and ""Watching the detective"". Definitely one of the best cover albums around and more coherent than anything Duran Duran have done in the last couple of years."
2,Meditation,Was not informed this book is a miniature book (4 inches). Would not have paid over $11 for this book had I known. Otherwise good content.
4,it works,Although it wont elevate you foot 10 inches as it does have a 2 or 3 inch give! company is very responsible!
1,Did not work for me when I had knee surgery,"This pillow was way too high to work for me, when I needed to elevate my leg following knee surgery. To me, the product was a 100% waste of money. I wish you better luck."
4,Good advice and inside view...,"I thought of this book as a tome of helpful advice for any project manage that has to work on a project that veers far into the unknown. The author was the Chief Architect for the P6 (Pentium Pro) microprocessor. This was a radically new type of processor that broke from previous chip architectures. The team was required to explore untested ideas but at the same time bring them to an operable design. This required considerable balancing and deft handling of various stumbling blocks. The author presents a lot of observations on how to accomplish this. It was also very interesting, for a person who is interested in microprocessors, to see where exactly time is spent in these massive projects. The author gives lots of technical details, but I would have like a bit more. Of course, the intention of this book was as a project management guide, so that isn't necessarily bad."
1,"Empty Promises, Over-hyped","This ""book"", more like an extended magazine article, is hardly ""Soul of a New Machine"" - that's just a laughable comparison. There are no daily digests of personalities arguing architectural features or fighting to meet an overly aggressive verification schedule. This book is merely a small compendium of paragraph length stores with longer chapters with ""whitepaper"" like advice. There's nothing particularly ""Intel"" or ""Pentium"" about the stories and you certainly don't get a feel for the people or the teams working with the project. There are better choices out there."
3,OK but not foolproof,"Had a surge due to whole house generator going on, protector blew out as it was supposed to but it was done, had to replace it. Second one was cooked due to a lightning strike to our house. It was smoking and would have caught house on fire if we did not unplug it. OK for most uses, but if have high surge issues, buy something with more Joules protection."
4,Quality name and great price,"Never had any trouble with Tripp Lite products, but I've also never had to call them in to cover any damaged equipment either! I like the way they designed the 3 outlets for transformers. It keeps the overall length down while still providing a decent amount of options. The indicator lights are easy to see. I would have given 5 stars if ALL the outlets were spaced just a little further apart. Not sure what else to say, so...get one!"
3,It works for now,"The handle is exactly like the original, made of hard plastic. The original cracked and this one will too, eventually. But it will work for a while. Wish they would offer a beefed up replacement, maybe made of metal."
3,Le Sigh...,"Sadly, I was disappointed. Like an earlier reviewer stated, the first half of the book is very interesting and informative, but the second half is bland to say the least.During the first half, Frissell touches on topics such as the greys, sirians, atlantis, kennedy assassination, etc. but the second half is nothing but a boring and incomprehensible synopsis of rebirthing sessions.However, on a side note, the topics he touched on did remind me to buy books more focused on topics I was interested in.His first book, _Nothing_in_This_Book_is_True,_But_it's_Exactly_How_Things_Are_ is a more interesting and informative read."
5,Hank's Got The Honky Tonk Blues,This Biography Covers Everythinhg On Hank's Life It's An Amazing Dvd On The Life The Lengend That Is Hank Williams It Has Interveiws With Hank's Kids Hank Jr. And Jett His Grandson His mother His Wives Audrey And Billie Jean Horton his Band MatesNever before Footage And Photos It Has It All In One Dvd It's Well Worth The Money I got mine here on amazon.com a year Ago But Anway Get The Complete Hank Box Set It's Great Have Some Really Great Music Anway If You Are a Big Hank Fan Pick This Up.
4,It works,"It works exactly as advertised. Nothing more, nothing less. But what else did you want? If you don't own a compatible unit - don't buy it. It's that easy."
5,Good company,"This charger got to me really rapidly. I needed it to give to my dad, because the only mp3 player he bought only had a usb port and he doesn't have a computer. And it got to me before I had to give it to him. It was great."
3,I'm sure it works,I'm sure this charger works the only problem is it dosen't fit my mp3 and for under $1.OO I'm not going to return it. Sam Mi.
1,psuedo-intellectual bile,"I must say that never before has a book started such a lively conversation at the dinner table. I am a student entering university, and this book was assigned as reading that would be discussed in focus groups at the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, this book did not provide entertainment through its intellectual means, but instead family members chose random passages throughout the book that the whole family would act out and laugh histerically at!While many of the sentences on first glance may seem provocative, they are almost entirely meaningless; devoid of any content.I have never read something composed of such pretentious, pathetic bile, nor had anyone in my extended family. Its psuedo-intellectualism insults its readers, and is a complete waste of time.Do not buy this book; you would find more intellectual stimulation by watching two obese people tearing off each other's clothes on the Jerry Springer show."
5,Every citizen must read,I read Soul of a citizen which inspired me to action. I am now a volunteer activist in my neighbourhood and have formed a group of concerned citizens to negotiate and participate in our city's development plan. We have made an impact in the corporation and even had a few small successes along the way.
4,An inspiring book,This book really is very good in my opinion. It presents you with all these problems that appear in our country or in the world yet it gives you hope that those things can change and that you have an impact on anything and everything you want to.
3,cheaper that brand new,The book was for my daughter's class. The price was great for a class that she'll probably forget all about after this semester. It was old and worn but it was three dollars. No complaints
4,The Root of the separation from God.,"Well, I thoroughly enjoyed the book but it is mistitled (probably at the behest of the publisher) but it is well-researched and gives one the lowdown of Evil vs. Good from our Judaic beginnings down through the ages. The authors know of which they speak. God's acts, covnenants, messages and colers are for our benefit while those of the Devil exist to confuse, confound and to separate us from God. we are pawns in a battle being waged by the fallen ones. This is a very good book but it falls short because the authors speak of this as the first book and it being only a taste of the whole proverbial pie."
3,Lucifer,"I purchased this book to learn more of the Fall of the Angels. My perception differs from the author's as to the reason for all the turmoil in the World. I don't know that I believe in Nephilim and their giant spawn, but I do believe in Lucifer."
2,Lisa Lampanelli: Take it like a man,"I am sure many people would enjoy this video I was not one of those people. There is a lot of cursing that was as bad as her attuide which is what she is noted for ""the queen of mean"""
1,disappointed...,"I saw a snippet of this comedian on you tube. I thought she was hilarious. So, I bought this CD. I was a little disappointed in it because I felt she was a too vulgar and that she spent too much time talking about her sex life. Parts of it were funny, but too much of it was not, in my opinion."
2,A very mixed message from this author,"I'm hoping to retire to Ecuador or another Andean country in three years or so, so I really looked forward to reading this book. The author is married to an Ecuadorian woman and has lived there for well over 20 years now, and he obviously loves the country. I found the sections on history, geography/ecology and culture/customs quite useful as a starting point. But then, he splashes cold water all over the reader with his sections on crime and health/medicine. He makes even a short visit to Ecuador seem like the most perilous possible journey -- if you don't die from some tropical disease, you surely will be mugged, robbed or murdered. In effect, he seems to be saying ""Gringos! Keep Out!"" Very disappointing."
4,very happy,"i picked this up after seeing it for 20 years. i always wondered but never bothered to check it out. it starts off slow but by mid point i was hooked. there's a good mixture of humor, sarcasim and action. if you were like me and were curious about this comic, spend the $20, you won't regret it."
1,Difficult System,"The M&S audio systems are VERY problematic. Installation is no problem but if there is a service problem with the system, it is very difficult to get it repaired. The company relies on regional jack-of-all trades companies to do the repairs. In my region, a security alarm company is assigned the task of service but they really don't put much effort into knowing the system. Thus, after purchasing a new audio system from M&S two years ago, I've had five service calls from the alarm company and the system still doesn't work. M&S claims they are symathetic but they are not willing to do anything actively to help me. I'm ready to junk this system because of lack of technical know how once the system is in your house."
3,Fun... but not perfect...,"My daughter really likes these for studying her math facts. The problem is that the printing is misaligned on some of them which makes them so you can't fold them. So, although a great idea, they don't always work. We have had to make our own using the book to look at."
5,It's Ok to be Different,"wonderful resource for children in K-3 or for older children to read to younger children. We need more tools like this to sensitize human beings at an early age, that we are all different."
5,Love this book!,"I have to say that I like Todd Parr's books, mainly because they are colorful and have unique illustrations that are an eye catcher for many kids.This particular book helps kids to understand differences. It talks about everyone being unique in all kinds of ways. Reading this book in a class allows students the opportunity to think about themselves and others. I would definitely recommend this book for a read aloud and allow for class discussion. Especially, if a teacher has a diverse classroom."
3,straight-forward treatment of respecting differences,"My kids thought the book was a bit long, but I was happy with the variety of ""differences"" mentioned in the text. I'd use it again."
2,Nice writing but silly story,"The author has a nice eye for suburban manners and style but she insults the reader's intelligence with a dopey plot that makes divorce look like a piece of cake, even with children in the picture. Old love and a new career come so easily to our heroine that it's just silly. I couldn't even suspend disbelief long enough to get caught up in the fantasy."
1,A disappointing attempt to jump on the chick-lit bandwagon,"Despite the rave reviews from some other customers, I couldn't see anything special here at all; the writing was ordinary and the people and situations unrealistic. Kennedy was too whiny and self-indulgent to make me care about her. If you're dying for good fluff, the novels of Jane Green and Jennifer Weiner are much more enjoyable, or if you want a story of marriage and motherhood that's not only fun to read but has some true insight, try Allison Pearson's I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother."
3,it wasn't as good as i tought,"this game is an o.k. game if u just want to shoot zomibes over n over again because in all the mission all u do is kill zombies theres really no point in any of them and when you shoot it doesnt always hit the spot where you aimed at, all the levels are almost alike a zombie pops out of nowhere or they come from behind you and such other surprises sooner or later you'll get bored of it but many people say that its a horrible game when its not, just dont play this game for too long because you will feel like you wasted alot of time on something that wasnt even worth it"
4,It's A Good Game,"It's not a masterpiece game, but Land Of The Dead: Road To Fiddler's Green is a good game. The graphics aren't that good at all, but the gameplay is cool. I was expecting more, but this is the best you'll get for a game that wasn't really talked about.If you're looking for a good cheap game to play, this game is perfect to play."
2,Brad nailer,"This nailer jams frequently and the nose has to be unscrewed to remove the jammed nail. It is nice and light and the belt hook is convenient. But it is loud and the performance is sub-par, I've been generally disappointed with the nailer."
1,broken,"received gun still broken, used it for the first time shoots 2 nails at a time no matter the pressure. also had a very lot of scratches on the casing of the gun.. very un happy with the product wish i bought a new one......zero stars was not an option which was my choice!"
1,Junk,"Just got this unit and it's probably only good as a paper weight. I'm so mad. Driving 1"" brads into pine and the striker is slipping off the brads every time. Sometimes driving the brads in and sometimes leaving half the brad driven in. Beware!!"
2,"Nail, Jam, Dry fire, Nail, Dry fire, Jam....","The tool is very light and comfortable to handle, but I was hoping for better performance. 50% of the time it dry fires (the pin actuates, and makes a dent in your work, but doesn't feed a brad). Then it jams about 5% of the time, which requires using the attached allen wrench, loosening the top of the (plastic!) nailer head, clearing the jammed brad, and trying again. I'm shooting 2"" brads (Bostitch brand). This is a ""reconditioned"" model - i.e. somebody returned it previously. I think I know why."
5,Pleased,"Well Pleased with the performance of this tool. It performs well even driving 2"" brads into oak wood. The price was very affordable for the novice, need more products like this one on the market today. Thanks"
1,Lemon,"Bought a Regza 42HL167 in January 2008, used it to watch occasional movies in the first year, then a bit of TV viewing in the next year.The third year, it started not powering up when turned on, and we'd unplug the TV for 10 seconds and re-try.It got worse and worse and in January 2011 it totally gave up.It wouldn't turn on, power-up, anymore, at all, regardless whatever we tried (short of the opening of the insides and re-programming).Toshiba acknowledged the problem in its website in Sept 2010, telling people to unplug it, wait and re-try, which we did, but Toshiba never volunteered for additional help.1.5 years later, it is still the same info about the problem:[...]Got barely a 3-year use out of it, for $1600.The Japanese usually built quality, but, I guess, not always.We shall stay out of Toshiba ever-never from now on.Won't recommend (any) Toshiba! Stay out of it.Mid-year 2011, we got a Panasonic Viera TC-L42D30; it is very good (so far)."
1,Terrible customer service,"Set arrived in Mid December, packaging was not damaged, but the quality of the display was awful. Toshiba customer service referred me first to a repair shop that was out of business, then to two shops that don't service my community.The 4th repair shop picked up the set a week later and then lied to me about the repair for 4 more weeks.Toshiba then asked me to agree to accept a smaller set in exchange, which I refused.They now promise to refund my purchase price (but not shipping!!!) in 4 to 6 weeks after some freight company gets around to picking it up.The set looks nice when I saw it working in the store, but consider the company behind it before buying!!! Toshiba's policies toward their customers are the worst."
1,Defective One!,I got 2 of these for myself and a friend. My friend loves it. Mine was defective out of the box! White lines on right hand side and picture turns wavy black after few minutes.Amazon is arranging for a pick up and full refund.
4,Different,Very different than the run of the mill romance. It kept my interest from beginning to end. Recommend this book. Su Kennedy
4,Great book but a re-issue from 1996!,"I love Susan King so when I saw this book, at this price no less ...I got very excited. Unfortunately for me this is a re-issue of her book of the same title from 1996. I wish that would be made clearer on the info of the book, from the Amazon site. I can assume this new date is for E-book issue.That said it's a wonderful story lush and full of details of the period. It is the first book of two related stories, the second called Lady Miracle original issue date 1997. If you have not read this then good for you, I hope you enjoy it!! If you have well, at this price it's nice to have as a back up on your E reader....if looking for new material.... then you are out of luck, sorry."
5,"Great movie, very informative!",This is a great and informational documentary that really opened my eyes to the situation in China. This is a must see!
1,poor sound quality,"No high end to speak of as far as the ""sound"" you hear, and the sound people are hearing on the other end. It sounds like you're talking through a pillow. Very hard to understand certain words."
3,Knockouts only on end (exactly what color is that anyway?),"Good solid piece of gear. It looks built to handle anything I can throw at it.I bought it to install under kitchen cabinets (hidden away up against the bottom of the cabinet where it won't be seen), so I wasn't overly concerned about the color. If I had created the color myself, I would name it ""seasick cream"". It is an extremely un-natural, very pale green.One problem for me was the fact that the knockouts for the electrical connections are only located in the ends. I want to mount it on the wall and bring in power from the back. I'll now have to use an armored elbow fitting or drill my own hole in it (which will surely compromise the UL certification)."
4,maintaining lineup...........,"The thing works good. Naturally the directions are chineese crap as is china. We still dont know if the springs are in the right place. Maintaining the lineup of the tape to the paper is hard, we have wasted a lot of tape and paper figuring it out. What the hell are the springs for and how do they fit on the rig, still dont know, dont bother looking at the directions, they are useless. Hung chow to yall."
3,Mediocre arrangements,"This is a book of ""so-so"" piano arrangements from The Orchestral Suite The Carnival of the Animals. I have done a recital with my students using this theme and have used The Lion, Kangaroos, The Cuckoo which I found satisfactory. My favorite piece ""Fossils"" was arranged quite poorly. The story in between the pieces we didn't use at all. I give 3 stars. There are much better arrangements out there."
4,Does the job,"What can I say? I installed the Cyberpower 1010HT surge suppressor a couple of months ago and have since been hit by several short commercial power outages, a major brown-out and a long power outage lasting about 24 hours. The 1010HT did the job and protected the equipment plugged into it including a LCD TV and home theater system. Would definitely recommend to friends."
1,ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT CATHOLIC BASHING,WHY CAN'T PEOPLE STICK TO REVIEWING RATHER THAN ALWAYS TELLING CATHOLICS WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM? YOU PEOPLE GIVE CHRISTIANITY A BAD NAME. THE BOOK IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT FORA LAPSED CATHOLIC TO SHOW HIS IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE FAITH.THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS ESTABLISHED BY CHRIST. THE OTHER DENOMINATIONS ARE BREAKAWAYS.
5,"Great book, important message.","Evangelical fervor over The Passion is quite disturbing. Showtime for the Sheep is a much-needed response. I hope the appeal to sound scriptural reasoning found within reaches as many souls as possible. I plan on purchasing a copy to help its exposure. To the critics of T.A. and TBC's character, please know that the book is indeed freely available online (which is no doubt quite costly to the ministry). I won't link directly to it with a URL as that would violate Amazon's review guidelines, but it is out there. Check The Berean Call's website for info."
4,glimps into the stone age,"This documentary consists of some unique footage of a lifestyle that probably has existed on the earth for hundreds of thousands of years, but now is gone, except from very few groups of people in tropical rainforests. It is important to remember that the people in the film are acting, the ""story"" is dramatized by Curtis, the editor. Still it indicates a lifestyle of intens and spontanous action, and at times quite violent. It leaves you with a lot of thoughts, and questions, both about the past and our modern lifestyle. Obviously to spend most of our lifetime in front of a computer is not the only way of living for a human being..."
3,exorbitant cost,"I have never seen this. I would love to, used to live on the northeast coast of Washington State, near Vancouver Island. However, the price of this is ridiculous. Get it from NetFlix and save a whole lot of money."
1,WARNING,"Warning: If you purchase this pos through MusiciansFriend.Com, they will not accept returns!The MAYA-44-USB has an extremely confusing, and dysfunctional driver installation procedure.The manual appears to be written by someone with a rather limited grasp of the English language, and no concept of technical writing.This product is *not* compatible with AtomixMP3 software.Avoid this, as well as MusiciansFriend.com. They have just lost a formally loyal customer for not allowing me to return this."
5,one of my favourites,"This has got to be one of my favourite books on nutrition. It was the first true nutrition book that I purchased years ago and it is pretty much an intro to the science behind what you eat, why you eat, and why you should eat or not eat certain foods. I recently repurchased this book because I lent mine out ages ago and I still love it. Highly recommend it!"
1,Way Too Complicated For The Average Reader!!,"There's no doubt that Brad King knows his nutrition, but this book is just too deep in biochemistry than it needs to be. One almost needs a degree in science to comprehend the first half of his book! Believe me, it is NOT an easy read! There are no real everyday meal samples to try and follow. I was very disappointed and got very little out of it. Don't bother and save your money."
4,"Good Conditions, Boring Book",It came in the condition it was promised to me. I don't really mind that a lot of the self-assessment activities are MIA.
2,Difficutly since new--didn't last past one year.,"The diverter originally came as part of a delta shower package during a new home construction. From day one the device had difficulty diverting the water while the water was flowing. It became a pain to constantly turn the shower on and off to use the handheld. After about one year, the item broke and water flowed from both shower head and handheld simultaneously. This caused a weak stream from both. After disassembly of the diverter I concluded it was missing a $0.50 O-ring which could not be easily replaced without using tools that would mar the finish. Forced to spend $60 for replacement part. I hold a high opinion of Delta products, but this was a disappointment."
1,Do not buy,We replaced shower fixtures for the Delta Venetian Bronze. The arm diverter quit working after about 6 months. The water comes out from both the main shower head and the hand held at the same time. Do not buy this diverter.
2,UNrealistic,Keep your money and buy a book that is actually suited for SAT II. I got a 800 with no help from this book at all. The problems are WAY too hard and perhaps you should buy it if you have nothing better to do. I am definitely telling you not to buy this book. BEWARE!Princeton Review book is much better...actually any other book is better than this.
1,i dont know why anyone would give this more than 1 stars...,"i am typically pretty good at math, but this book was absolutely ridiculously hard. the tests are nothing like the real thing and some questions are impossible to do because they lack drawings. i bought this book because of its high ratings, but WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Great Album for Mraz Fans,"This is, obviously, not one of Jason Mraz's best albums, but it is definately a great one to add to your collection.Mraz is an extraordinary singer/song-writer.His songs sound so simple, and yet each one of them can reach so deep.Mraz creates the most awesome lyrics by far, and he absolutely follows through in this album.It is also neat to see how this musical hero started out. For those of you who didn't know, Java Joe's is where Mr. Mraz got his start to his awesome career and exciting adventure through musical exploration."
5,The greatest...CD....ever.....,"I bought this CD after reading others reviews about how amazing this live recording was. And the others were not lying...this is the best CD I have ever purchased, and by far the best CD in my collection...I HIGHLY reccomend buying this CD even if you don't know who Jason Mraz is....it is THAT good."
5,The best boards book ever,This is by far the most outstanding boards review book I have encountered. It breaks down the subject matter into digestible pieces that are easy to interconnect and remember. It is a great framework by which many of the details from clinical and preclinical years can be review. I used this book for all three steps and scored highly. I cannot recommend this book more stongly. Buy this book! The authors are obviously highly knowledgable in both the basic science and clinical aspects necessary to produce a high quality medical board review.
2,THE ACERBIC RABBI STRIKES THE UK,"I've been a fan of former Rabbi Jackie Mason since I was a kid. Admittedly, he's not for everyone. His acerbic, irreverent and decidedly politically incorrect humor still provokes in JACKIE MASON: A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (Kulture). His one man show at London's elegant, prestigious Royal Opera House is a perfectly ironic setting for his caustic observations on everything from elderly Jews, George Bush, Tony Blair, the French and much more. Get a front row seat to be offended with the truth. It only hurts if you don't laugh.Not as funny as some of Mason's other performances (see ""The World Accoding To Me""), but he's loose and relaxed and seems to be having a good time with his audience of sometimes bewildered (?) Brits and laughing fellow Jews. (Through no fault of his own, Mason's previously recorded comments about Ararfat seemed oddly out of place when I saw this DVD on the day of Arafat's chaotic funeral.)"
2,Thin Material,These jeans are soft and comfortable for the most part but tear out at the back pockets all the time. I have had several pairs of them and am trying not to buy them anymore. There is not enough belt loops either and some times the Chinese or Pakistan kids making them sew the pockets in the wrong places.
3,Not what I was looking for.,I was looking for an item to use that I could drive my truck in the garage and bump the front wall without damaging anything. This is kinda flimsy. Would be fine to keep doors from scratching or denting. I sent it back.
2,too small,too small to serve useful purpose. soft rubber and easy to mount. looks fine but needs to be about 6-12 inches longer.
5,bumper,"Not as long as I'd like, which makes it a bit more difficult to line up for doors for multiple cars or if you aren't quite sure where the door hits the wall. But, it is the cushioning i needed. I would buy another one."
2,"Cute, but cheap","My 5yo wanted to be The Flash so badly this year, and this is the best deal I could get on one of the costumes. Unfortunately, the sizing was on the small side (size 4-6 and he wears a size 5), so it bunched up when he had to wear a thin layer under his costume and was clearly too small by then. Also, after one wearing, there were threads loose all over his costume.I still would have bought it knowing all this because he wanted to be this so badly, and I imagine it will be wearable for his little brother someday. But still, cheap."
4,In a Flash!,Out of the ordinary costume that my 5 y/o son loved! He was very comfortable and still wears it around the house and to bed.
1,"Do not buy these bolts ,they are trash","After shooting these bolts just one time each ,either the knocks or the tips came off. These bolts are not made for the Barnett crossbow they are advertised with either(caution) check the information they are only 14""s and could damage your crossbow."
2,Returned,"These bolts were ordered along with a 150# cross bow. They were too short for the bow that was ordered, therefore returned. Since the products were ordered together it should have been known they would not work with this bow."
2,"A good story, but certainly not a mystery or a thriller","I read the back of the book and thought I would love it so I bought it. The book had a good story but had no mystery, murder or thrill. The back cover led you to believe the book was filled with all three. This book was basically a life story of one family with many hardships to overcome. I do not recommend it as a murder mystery. There is NONE. Not to mention the numerous spelling mistakes in my paperback edition."
3,Missing A Few Major Destinations...,"I really like the way this book is written, constructed, detailed, and organized, however, there are a few top hikes in the Death Valley area that are not mentioned or just brushed over. I'm not sure if that is done intentionally or not, but if the title of the book is ""Hiking Death Valley: A Guide to Its Natural Wonders and Mining Past"", it should have a fully detailed Panamint City trip, among others. I would recommend it for the other trips detailed in it."
3,Good economy spotting scope,"This spotting scope is pretty decent and if you can get it on sale even better.The image quality is good. I compared this scope with my Steiner Military Marine binoculor and while the center of the Steiner image is sharper, the edge quality of this spotting scope is better!It is overall pretty solid with a eyepiece protective cover that screws on and an objective cover that snaps on. The tripod is stable and solid and also includes a nice soft case."
4,Sheep Lovers Cult Film,"Similar to the 50's ""Killer Tomatoes"" this film would have a cult following if it hadn't been produced so well! Fun and implausible ""killers"" on the loose but the director handled the special effects, acting and story-line too professionally. Good storyline for those involved with sheep and related wool activities...but beware of the excessive blood. Worth a watch for the giggles."
3,Not bad.,This is a very interesting take on zombies. It is not too bad. I highly recommend to any zombie fan.
5,Wow!,"This movie was suggested to me by a friend. When I found that it wasn't available as a streaming movie on Netflix, I told him I probably wouldn't watch it. He then bought it for me. It is awesome! I mean, a hippie environmentalist that calls herself Experience? Classic. This movie has no rating, so keep in mind that it is meant for adults. If you enjoy off-beat humor and don't mind bloody scenes, check it out!"
4,THE VIOLENCE OF THE LAMBS! HOW COOL IS THAT?,"THIS FUN IS JUST GREAT FOR A GUILTY PLEASURE FILM. EXTREMELY OFF-BEAT CONCEPT. THESE LAMBS DON'T GO QUIETLY TO THE SLAUGHTER, THAT'S FOR SURE. A LITTLE ON THE GORY SIDE, BUT JUST A FUN FLICK LIKE ""VAMPIRE KILLERS""."
4,Not as bad as I thought....,"If you go into the movie knowing that it's supposed to be funny and ridiculous, it's actually pretty enjoyable. I think all the negative reviews are from people that tried to watch it as a horror movie, which it clearly isn't!"
2,Meh,"BLACK SHEEP is a well made horror slash comedy from down under but barely engaging as a whole. The FX are what's best about an experience gone wrong involving (what else?) sheeps. There are some funny moments but some scenes definitely fail to work as a dark comedy (animals cutting cheese, for example). The actors do manage being believable but none are really worth rooting for. The production values do impress however. It's just a bummer to see a film with that great of a potential ending up being an okay time-waster, top. Maybe the director's next project will do the trick.-----Martin Boucher"
5,Good basic rack mount power strip,"Most home electrical boxes are rated at 20 amp MAX for the entire circuit, so unless this is the only item on the line, why pay for the bigger units?My HTPC might draw 5 amps if EVERYTHING is turned on, but an extension cord on the floor is ugly. The power cord is long enough to direct wire to one of your outlets inside the wall (hire an electrician if you're unsure how to do it)"
4,"Soil Microbiology, Ecology and Biochemistry, Third Edition","Soil Microbiology, Ecology and Biochemistry, Third Edition by Eldor Alvin PaulThe topics that the editor selected, are well developed and its updated bibliography. This book serves both query for the teacher as the degree and postgraduate student.My best wishes"
4,Good but not best value,These are good but I think that the Swanson butterburr is better value and it has a higher potency. Both work to keep my migraines away. I take 3 of these two times a day or two of the Swanson 75 mg ones twice a day.
4,lovin' juliet,the two above are actually both right and if thats the plot for cheeky angel then someone needs to review some copyright laws. this book is awsome in itself in a cliche kind of way its predictable but in a good kind of way. the book has nice graphics and is appropriate for kids from one to ninety two enjoy!
4,Decent but VERY Salty,"It makes for a quick snack, but Jeebus, this thing is salty! I usually have to eat it will something else (protein shake, etc), to dull the salty tang.Aside from that, it's quick, convenient, and gives me a quick dose of nutrition when I least have time to prepare a healthy home-cooked meal post-workout."
2,nothing extraordinary,"I bought this video and the same video for the German Shepherd puppy and guess what? The were identical outside of the people talking, the dogs in the video and the breed history of the dog. VERY generic. Breed history is interesting but was still not any more informative than an internet search or a short book."
5,Great Stain Remover!,"I love these stain removing pens. I keep one in my office and one in my laptop bag at all times. They come in very handy for removing stains after accidents while eating. I have had pretty good success getting ketchup, soda, wing sauce, and grease out of shirts with this Tide Pen.I used to keep one in my car, but during the summer, I think the liquid dried up faster, so now I keep it in my laptop bag, which I usually have with me. The clothes I use are not dry-clean only, so if you use dry-clean only clothes, I don't know if this will work for you. Maybe try it on an area of your shirt that isn't visible to see how well it works first.The way it works is that you press the pen tip down into the clothes, and it releases some of the stain removing liquid. Then you use the hard tip to rub the liquid in, removing the stain.I definitely recommend getting a few of these!"
5,"Wonderful model, simply stunning.","I have seen roughly the entire Air Gear series, and kept up with the manga to a certain point. But I just loved Simca's design, and character so much, and when I found this Excellent model from Mega House of her, I found out about it late as usual because I dont keep up on anime merchandise as much as I used to. But I was glad I found this model of her. It is perfect to every detail, and simply stunning to display. Though I did have a slight problem displaying her. The bottom of the display base, where you push the point of the green into and between her two wheels on her feet, it is a bit difficult to get in, or at least it was for me. It broke off inside and I was stuck with a base that would not stay on her and a figure that would not stay up. But lucky that super glue fixes everything (almost everything in my experience) but it fixed it and now she is standing tall."
3,"Ok grips, OK price","Not very attractive but a great price and they are Hogue, easy to hang onto and a good fit. I think these will do fine until I find a better set for my Rock Island. I hated the smooth uncheckered Rock Island grips. These will be passed on when I find a nicer looking set."
5,Love Them,They can remove even the smallest hairs and they are of superior quality. I ordered the Sally Hansen and the LaCross am very pleased with performance of both and would recommend to others.
2,Behind this vulgar cover is...a vulgar book,"Sorry, girlfriends, but we need to grow up. We're wives and mothers, and no amount of juvenile storytelling is going to turn our lives into fairy tales. I was hoping for a smart, funny look at what our lives (or my life-I'm 36, with 2 girls and a boy in the suburbs) are really like, but this is a lame, unsatisfying fantasy with characters that don't ring true."
3,Okay for modeling mom (or dad),"I bought the Tidy Time Vacuum because my 2-year old daughter tries so hard to take my actual vacuum out of my hands whenever I am cleaning the house. I would have let her continue to take my vacuum - believe me - if it weren't too heavy for her, which frustrated her quite a bit. She enjoys the Tidy Time Vacuum a lot, but usually only ""plays"" with it when I'm cleaning - in other words, for her, it really is about doing what mommy is doing, vs. a toy she plays with regularly on her own. The vacuum itself is quite realistic in terms of look and sound - there are tiny white beads just inside the handheld component that move about as the vacuum ""whirrs"" - and the vacuum actually works! I've had to clean it out several times which, by the way, can be tricky to do as you have to stick your fingers through a smallish opening to pull out whatever has been sucked up into it. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase of this vacuum as it serves the specific purpose I had in mind."
4,Great Deal,Product was what was expected. Price was very reasonable considering the product was brand new and has worked wonderfully well. My family and I have laughed much through watching this show. Recommend it for anyone who grew up in the 80's or anyone with children that would like to have a wholesome show for them to watch.
1,not so good,"the content of the item it self it's great but que cd holder inside arrived borken, didn't cause any damage to the cd's."
3,Quality,The quality of this product isn't that good. It has been used and worn out; the pages in the bOok are torn. It also took a long time to get to me. It took so long I had forgotten about it.
5,A new beginning to a Happy Ending,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!! This is such a well-made album. I love this album so because its well-made, honest, and full of love. (Not like the albums out today) I would recommened to anyone who has ever liked or loved Tears for Fears, to go out and BUY this cd ASAP. You won't regret it."
2,Crappy Ending,"I was excited to hear that Orzabal and Smith had reunited. I was hoping to find their finale work to be something like what we had come to love Tears For Fears for. After listing to this album three times through, I just can't find anything familiar or appealing. Only three of the songs would I even listen to as background music.Is this album like ""Songs from the Big Chair""? No. Is it like Elemental or Raoul? No. It's something like a Beatles imitation. Instrumentation is rather weak, and the lyrics lack the pizzaz we've come to expect from TFF. Oh well, at least I got this one at a reduced price. I always loved Tears for Fears. Sad to see them go out on such a low note."
3,not so good,"j waited more from them,the sound is not clear,the melody is too foreseeable and the songs that sing Curt are not interessing.After many years that they missed ,in sincerity j hoped to something of special."
1,Dazed and a little bit Confused,"How I waited and awaited this release. How disappointed I am.Except for the track ""Last Days on Earth"" and a few vocal riffs where Roland soars this new album is headed for the discount rack.I wonder how this came to pass.Roland's ""Tomcats"" is very appealing to a TFF fan. However Curt's solo efforts as shown on his site are mind-numbing.Perhaps that's the answer.I was hoping for the best or at least a fair effort."
2,Too Mainstream,"I previewed this CD before I bought it, and I'm convinced that I just heard the best parts of each song, which isn't much, sadly. I'm sorry I fell for that lure, because once I bought the CD and played it through twice, I was ready to get rid of it.Actually, it was after the first time, but I decided to give it another chance.I love TFF. But this is just so disapppointing. In each song I hear two things: the same old sound (that can be found on their previous albums) combined with a weak attempt at something soulful and popish. The songs are jumbled messes of weak melodies all strung together. It just doesn't hold my interest. Even their attempt at Beatlesque sounds, while promising, whimpers out too soon.If you want generic pop music, this is your album. Otherwise, you're better off saving your money."
4,A Great New Start,"I have always been a Tears fan. I have lived with much critizism from friends who feel that they were always too commercial and pop. I felt the ""Everybody Wants to Rule The World"" was literally the best song of the 80s and it really torqued me that Tears weren't even voted as one of the top artists of the 80s by VHF fans. Happy Ending brought back the hope of more. I won't go into a song by song analysis as others have done a great job of that. Simply this - if you are a Tears fan then you will like this one. I personally like it more than Seeds but then Elemental is my favorite so who knows. As of this writing, they have not written enough for a new CD and that worries me. I hope they haven't thrown in the towel for good."
1,Utterly Forgettable,"This Tears for Fears album is a guaranteed entry into the Hall of Lame. I have always had problems with one band mimicking another too much. This is like the Beatles reincarnated. Now the Beatles are one of the most mimicked of all time and for good reason. They were visionary... FORTY YEARS AGO. Not in 2004. Tears for Fears is much more enjoyable when it finds its own groove instead of copying someone else's. I'd recommend skipping this album and spending your money elsewhere. You'd only be looking to resell this a few months later, and resale value on it is a sure-fired Dog's a Best Friend's Dog."
4,How Colleges Work,"Excellent overview of the various different college structures. Author worked hard to create analogies for how college systems were linked, but after getting into middle and later chapters the anlogies made some sense. A good introduction to, as the title says, how colleges work."
4,Interesting Donovan Tribute,"It's strange that Donovan has not been given as many tribute albums as some of his peers. Following four or five instrumental tributes (mostly by little known orchestras) came this tribute just as Don was back in the spotlight. Most of the artists are obscure with the exception of Sarah MacLachlan, No Man and a few that might be known in their native countries. Donovan himself does the introduction and among the songs are a previously unreleased one called ""Armaggeddon"" by Julian Jones the stepson of Brian Jones and Donovan's mistress Linda in what might be his singing debut. This has some of the classics but a few are missing ""Mellow Yellow"", ""Catch the Wind"", ""Season of the Witch"", ""Atlantis"", etc. About ten years later another tribute showed upGift From a Garden to a Flower: A Tribute to Donovanagain by indepenent artists (some with weird names)!"
5,A great concert,This is a great performance from Megadeth and the euphoric audience from Argentina is awesome and the set list couldn't be better. I recomend it.
5,Megagood!,"This is how I wish all my concert DVDs are, unfortunatley very few live up to this kind of standard!Mustaine is very, very good at what he does...Oh and his band is pretty good too :)"
5,Nice variety concert in South America.,"This takes a different twist as it was filmed in Argentina, they really like to rock hard there. I found the extent of Megadeth's music to be awesome. This is my favorite live DVD to date."
1,the throw away child,was recommended school reading for this summer 2004. i thought it was written poorly. grammar was that of a six year old who probably wants sympathy from her peers. the throw away child book was thrown away in the trash can. booooooooo
1,A complete waste of time and money,"I forced myself to ignore the poor writing style and poor editing of this book and endured as much as I could take of it and finally about half way through I gave up. The only things I learned in this book is that the writer has no desire to look at anything honestly and that publishers should be required to buy back books when they are this bad. I realize that the ""publisher"" is basically a vanity press but really they ought to have a little self respect."
3,Distance needed from topic....,"Had the author tempered her anger more effectively, the book might have delivered a stronger message. The bitterness overwhelms the topic, obscuring the details of her traumatic experience. The author's anger is palpable, thereby distracting to the credibility of the book."
4,5 more than you Started With.,"Good Power Cord.Good grade Plug.The strip itself is a bit minimalist..As shown, It does not support adjacent wall wartz.You can dangle a wall transformer off the end, - and, that's about it. (without loosing sockets).Durable, well made, reasonable price."
2,"Great movie, when I could watch it.","I ordered this movie and wasn't able to watch it until after the two week return policy had expired. It turns out that something was wrong with the dvd, and it would skip through half of the whole movie. I wouldn't even play in my blue ray or dvd player because it was too messed up and the only way I was able to watch it was in my computer, and even then it would skip. I had to buy it somewhere else so I could properly watch it. My advice is make sure that whoever you buy it from has a return policy and make sure you watch in different devices to make sure it works well."
4,Anarchic energy,"This is a grab bag of almost all the themes and character types found in Dick's other novels written in the early 60s. Everything is here: a repressive police state, a ruling elite in conflict with huge cartels, a charismatic cult leader, a fascinating and ruthless woman, time travel, psychic powers, Nazis, androids, emigration to Mars, and mind-manipulating media and simulacra. It shows that the way society appears to be structured is a complete fake, and that media manipulation conceals the real centers of power. Dick crowds more characters and different points of view into the anarchic pages of pages of this novel than in any of his other books. But it does not seem to go anywhere: it is a plunge into the deeper waters of Dick's universe, but without any clear re-emergence into the air. The energy is more frenetic than transformative. Such a tour de force lacks the impact of Dick's major works, though it is a dazzling ride. It's pure PKD."
2,A muddled mess.,"I've read over 1/2 of PKD's works in the past year+ now and of all of them, this is the biggest muddled mess I've seen. It's not only hard to follow, but the plot never really gets anywhere. Subjects are brought up, and really nothing much ever happens with them. If you are new to PKD, this is NOT the place to start reading his works. I don't even think I like this one as much as I liked The Zap Gun....and that's not his greatest work either. I think Dick tries to impress us too much with his own brand of talk and jargon, his fascination wtih all things Nazi and Mars. His writing style to me assumes we know his way of talking/writing from his other novels or he just enjoys using complicated words for simple things. It's just a mish-mash of everything and probably written while he was either on ludes or on a big bender. I found it hard to finish...much less continue once into it."
2,Close but No Cigar!,"Mine was wired in between the wall jack and the Answering Machine/Base Station. The device receives calls and displays the caller id info but does not pass Caller ID information downstream to the Answer Machine/Base Station. So all the wireless handheld phones show is 'Incoming Call' and no Caller ID info even though all the info is on the Phone Ring Control device. I loved the interface, but I needed the caller id info to be passed on to the Answer Machine/Base Station for this to be useful.I also tried it on a different jack by itself (no phone). I wish it would hang-up rather than filter the R list numbers to stop the call from still ringing on the Answering Machine/Base Station and other phones when installed on a dedicated jack. I had an old Radio Shack one that got fried in a power surge so I have been looking for a new one. This will not work unless there are some undocumented features in the microcode."
4,Black list your annoying callers,"I use Vonage at home, and they don't provide the ability to create a list of numbers/people whose calls you never want to receive (blacklist them). Google voice offers such, but Vonage and ATT (for my cell phone) do not. I can't imagine why. It is like a junk mail filter for emails, but applied to the phone calls you receive based on their caller ID. This machine allows for that (plus some other features I do not care for), but is limited to some 20 phone numbers. Well, at least I can block the most annoying callers, and once they give up, I can renew that list with more of them. I wish they come up with a new machine that allows for many more numbers to be blocked. A draw back is that the caller ID does not reach my actual headset, it stops at this machine (it displays there, but not past it). The machine is between the wall and my headset."
1,Didn't last very long,"This Caller ID with Phone Ring Control, A Computer to Stop Unwanted Calls and a Completed IT System to Control Phone Ring only lasted 5 months and started letting calls through that I had on the reject list and then stopped displaying any text. I paid $88.00 for it and I see its $70.00 now. I suggest you save your money and stay away from this item and look for another product."
2,Pin or Password lacking,No blocking equipment can be truly effective unless the live caller is required to enter a pin or password. Just a list of numbers permitted to call through makes it difficult to keep up with one time callers that you want to receive e.g. A delivery person whose number you will not know in advance.
1,NOT for English speakers,"This book sounds promising, but unfortunately the Polish words are very old-fashioned and outdated. I currently live in Poland & studied the Polish language last year, & after a few months of embarrassment & frustration, I put away the McKay & began taking a small pocket dictionary to class. I can't speak for native Polish speakers trying to learn English, but if you are a native English speaker trying to learn Polish, you should look elsewhere, as I currently am, for a user-friendly dictionary with the native English speaker in mind."
4,"Slice and Dice, Baby","This author slice and dices through the English language, rips apart old cliches and idioms. Almost every sentence is a joke, and it can be jarring at times. However, Aylett gives us such a fresh perspective on the language of death and destruction that it makes Slaughtermatic a must read for anyone looking for something original. I hope to see more come from this author."
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"I enjoyed reading this short book, but afterwards I had that guilty feeling I used to get after seeing a gory B movie.... It was fun, but I don't really want to admit to anyone that I enjoyed it.The story itself is a bit confusing and choppy, but there is enough entertainment on each page to keep you reading.As a matter of fact, this book contains some of the best sentences ever written. Here's a couple of my personal fav's...""He had a big soul which he sold by the hour.""""Father died in a voting accident.""...and my personal favorite sentence in the whole book...""A convict in transit convinced the cop to whom he was handcuffed that the cop was the guiltier man, at which the cop shot him and escaped.""That one had me laughing for hours.It's little jewels like this that kept me reading."
3,An acquired taste.,"If paranoid schizophrenia and sociopathic behavior suddenly became extremely contagious most every major city would resemble Beerlight--if you made sure that the unbalanced but well medicated citizens all had unlimited amouts of firepower at their disposal.Slaughtermatic hits the ground running and doesn't stop. No one, not the reader or the characters have time to slow down and figure out what the hell is going on with the story. I'm not really sure what Aylett's objective was, perhaps, he wanted to create a book that only a homocidal reader could fully comprehend.Still, if you suspend your disbelief as well as any hope of making sense of the story, it can be a fun ride."
3,Fine looking dish towels to spice up your kitchen,These are some nice looking towels to spice up your kitchen dish towels a bit.
5,Hard to find nails,"Big box stores in my area, and other hardware stores don't carry a full line of Bostich nails. Other brands jam in gun. These work perfectly everytime. I keep these order history printouts in my shed to identify my source of supply, Amazon covers everyrhing I have required to date."
5,Marine Heavygunner review,"A Real Good First Person Shooter With Nice Long Missions And Real Good GamePlay,Also Groove Games WWII Sniper and Marine Sharpshooter 1 2 and 3,Smile"
3,she has a great voice,This is a good cd. She has a very sexy voice and her ability to sing in many different languages adds to the sensual quality. There are 4 outstanding tracks.
2,fell loose from binding,This booklet was given as a gift and apparently it fell apart. Embarrassed but recipient chose to keep the book.
3,Marine radio,This appears to be a fine radio. But I did not realize that there were so many components that needed to be purchased before I can use it. I take responsibility for not knowing myself. But the item discription might have alerted me to the fact that there were additional components necessry before I can use it. It is still not up and running because I am having trouble finding the necessary parts. I did not know that I did not know.
4,Rebranded version of the same radio,"I picked up this radio ""rebranded"" by a marine retailer.I've found it works very well. I was also able to connect a handheld GPS to it with very little effort.The power selection feature is nice for not blowing away anyone near you. The DSC feature is nice for getting the location of family members in others boats.I really like the one touch ""distress"" feature, although I've never used it. When connected to a GPS, it will send your location to the Coast Guard. Good for me since my wife doesn't speak english.I have nothing negative to report other than the mic cannot be removed. However, there is a remote mic available separately.I would like to include instructions for connecting a serial connector to the included accesory cable (for the GPS) but amazon doesn't allow this. Maybe you can ""search"" for it."
3,Not for large gauge wires,I am using 12 gauge wire for all my speaker runs and wanted this type of connector to terminate them to a pair of Yahama NS1000M speakers. The NS1000Ms are older speakers that use a clamp type terminal. The 12 gauge wire will not fit in the solder cup on the THX speaker pins. Yes you can trim the wire down and with some careful soldering make them work but the color coded caps are not large enough to accmodate the 12 gauge wire. The specs should show the maximum usable wire size but do not.
1,Junk!,"Complete junk. First, there are no instructions on how to use these connectors (they certainly are not as intuitive as toilet paper). Second, the rubber coverings are way too loose and are useless. This has to be one of the most frustrating items I have ever purchased from Amazon. Don't expect to find help from their (Monster Cable) web site, all you will find are similar bad customer reviews."
2,"Unusual voice, disappointing album.","I enjoy a huge spectrum of Christmas music, and look for something new each year. This album gets 2 stars for variety, but that's where the positives end. Mouskouri has an unusual voice that I found grated on my nerves to such a degree that I couldn't finish listening to the album even one time through. My family shared the sentiment. The song arrangements are odd and poorly mixed as well. Unless you are already a fan of Mouskouri, I would advise checking out some samples of her singing to be sure her ""sound"" is for you before investing in this album...wish I had done so."
4,"Pretty good, was expecting a little more German music","I really enjoy foriegn music, which is why i bought this CD. It's good but some of the songs are unknown and renditions are different from my favorites."
5,Great Christmas Album,"Nana Mouskouri does an excellent job of singing carols from all over the world, many in the language they were originally written. She has a wonderful voice and I really enjoy her arrangements of the carols. Outstanding!"
4,ideal,this is the second one i have purchased. perfect for a laptop as it beats having to deal with a full-size surge protector.
4,Pretty nice,"Nice and small. I haven't had any surge so cant say much about that. It hopefully (and should) work though.The holes for plugging in stuff is kind of in a weird position, but that doesn't bother me."
4,"It's peppy, it's fun, and most of all my son likes it!","Ok, so we all know that parents and young children have very different tastes in music. I actually LIKE these songs. My 3 yr old son and I dance and sing and laugh at the silly words to some of the songs. When he gets the giggles really bad now, I ask him if he ate a slice of ""Sillie Pie"". And the ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"" song cracks him up.Most 3 year olds I know aren't music critics (yet) and this tape gets him moving and dancing. And me too sometimes.The artist has a great singing voice and I like that so much more than the character-sung albums like ""Barney"" and ""Sesame Street"" not to mention the infamous ""Chimpmunks Christmas""."
5,Lovely Nature DVD,"This DVD captures many facets of the beauty of the Cape. It is set to harp music, which is very well done and quite relaxing. Since this DVD has only music with no narration, and the scenery is so beautiful, watching this video is like doing a meditation. The whale footage is great, and the sunrise and sunset scenes are memorable. Since this has no narration, it is really a nature/meditation DVD rather than a tourist DVD. I have watched a few times, and highly recommend it."
2,You would have to LOVE the work nuveaux cuisine requires,"to be able to enjoy this cookbook, because,ONE, All the recepies are much more complicated versions of classic dishes that I have prepared in the past .... ie. I tried to fry the spaetzle dish to a golden brown ... good luck ...TWO, Some of the recepies just don't even cut it as far as taste is concerned...... I have for years made Salmon tartare from an old Russian recepie so I was pleased to try the Tuna tartare in this book ... but .. even sticking to the ingredients ... there was a lot left over after the party ....I think this book and the recepies would be great in a kitchen where you have more than 1 cook preparing the meal ..... sorry ,,,,,..."
4,Very Romantic,"I bought this CD basically for the song ""Europa"". I remembered it from oh so long ago! But the entire CD is good. Very romantic and soothing."
5,"Europa, Europa, Europa.","If your a fan of the Saxophone, you'll love the song Europa. I played the saxophone in my youth, so I'm partial to it. The song Europa ranks as my all time favorite Sax song ever. You can just feel the emotion drip from the horn of Gato Barbieri on it."
5,Excellent as always,I used to have the older version of this stick made to plug into a game port on the sound card. USB port makes it a lot easier to install. Make sure you calibrate before using. The previous version has taken a ton of use and is VERY reliable. I'm sure this one will perform just as well.
3,"Cheaply made, but it works.","I was looking for a replacement garage door opener and came across this one. Description says it will work on Intellicode openers manufactured after 1995, I checked mine, it was manufactured in 1996. Prime shipping was fast like always. The remote was packaged in a plain white box, programming it was fairly easy and took less than one minute, it worked right away. The only problem is it's made so cheaply with the cheapest kind of plastic, the battery door doesn't even fit nicely. It looks like it will break right away if it happens to get dropped. For $20 I paid, I would expect something with more decent quality, like the one I had before, which was made in Canada, and this one is made in China."
3,Genie GIT-1BL Review,The directions included with the product were for the older model Genie one-button control. The directions indicated I needed to install a battery. I bought the battery indicated in the instructions. It turned out that the remote already had a battery in it when shipped. I was able to get a refund for my battery purchase. Sending the correct instructions would have save me several hours of time.
5,Genie One Button Remote Control with Intellicode,"Works great no problem, very simple devise, easy to program. No real need to review, universally understood to be good. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000628QSA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,"poor quality, the entire thing fell apart after 1 use!",This THING is the worst quality merchandise I ever purchased! It's ripping everwhere after a single use. one of the buckles snapped right off rendering the THING useless.
5,A traveling mommie's must have.,"I purchased this pac back for my recent trip to Florida with my 2 1/2 year old and me. It made everything so much easier. I put the carseat on my back, my daughter in the stroller, hung the diaper bag from the back of the stroller and pulled my small carry on bag. It was perfect... People kept offering help but it really disrupted my system.I love my pac back, it is comfortable, convinient and good looking too."
1,Junk Metal,"I've had the misfortune of owning two such frames. Even with gentle care, in no time the middle began to sag (no center support). Opening and closing the unit with the mattress in place was impossible, as the mechanism would simply jam, so one had to take the mattress off completely to open and close. Soon the mechanism began to bend and jam. The handles also break off easily. If you get a year's use out of this, you're lucky."
1,Buy this futon if you really like visiting your chiropractor,"With all the glowing reviews, I thought I should jump on the bandwagon. This futon barely lasted two years, after which it completely fell apart, but not before scratching my hardwood floor and giving me some serious back problems. I guess it was my punishment for skimping on a futon. Lesson learned. Thank you Coaster."
2,Made for geeks,"It comes with NO manual or even a how to where to start, not one piece of printed material. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out all the buttons and sliders. The assumption seems to be that you know how to ""map"" a game controller without any help. Buy this if you are a tech person, if you are not a tech be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to learn. I sent it back after wasting a lot of time."
5,A Must have in your cookbook collection!,I love Nigella Lawson's books and show. Every recipe that I have tried so far has been a winner. The bread pudding is amazing and the cupcakes are so fast and easy you will never buy them from the bakery again. Definitely try the Asian Kedigree- it is a great way to keep salmon from being boring!I highly recommend this book. Happy Eating!
1,not worth $25,"I was so excited by the idea of this book--a Black woman struggling with her weight issues and ultimately learning to love herself-- that I bought two copies, one for myself and one for mon amie, one of my best friends. I wish I had waited for paperback or the library.There are some good isolated scenes in this book, but, overall, it doesn't live up to it's potential. Serpentine has some important things to say and important lessons to learn, but the character is not fully developed and is therefore a shallow character who just happens to have a couple of deep moments. YES a lot of women will recognize themselves in Serpentine and her struggles and emotions. However, just because we can identify, doesn't mean we should settle for a poorly crafted novel with an illogically constructed plot.I also had some serious problems with the fact that a very serious occurence is glossed over in the book (I won't say what because I don't want to give it away to those who haven't read it)."
1,If You Have Nothing Else To Read...,"This was the most recent selection for our book club here in the Philadelphia area. This book rated LESS than 1 star averaged among all the readers in the club (on a scale of 0 to 4). Some comments were that Ms. Berry ""had a good story [but] dropped the ball with it"" and that ""she just didn't seem to know how to develop what she had."" Although we seemed to applaud her idea of covering some serious issues involving full-figured women, we simply did not like this book. Very disapointing after ""So Good""."
3,Average,"This book was not all that I thought it would be. Based on the title, I was expecting a little bit more."
2,ALL OF ME,"THIS BOOK WAS A FAR CRY FROM ""SO GOOD"" IN TERMS OF INTERESTING. I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE QUITE BORING. THE AUTHOR JUMPED FROM ONE POINT OF THE CHARACTERS (SERPENTINE) LIFE TO ANOTHER WHICH AT TIMES MADE THE READING CONFUSING. I'M SORRY BUT VENICE BERRY WAS NOT AT HER BEST WHEN WRITING THIS BOOK."
2,Cheap,Bags do not fit properly. I thought that I would save some money and get the cheaper version since I was not sure if the girls would like golf. Although my expectations were low I was still drastically let down.Would not recommend.
1,No pictures,"I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire. If it had the illustrations, I would have read the text, but instead of the illustrations I just got icons of a camera and a red exclamation point, so I returned the book without even trying to read it."
5,Wow!!,Ya gotta get this book - it is so funny! Heard about it on the radio and it turned out to be as outrageous as it sounded! Glad to see people are finally telling it like it is!
1,"Probably an OK joystick, but not described correctly on Amazon...","BEWARE!! This joystick DOES NOT have ""twist"" capabilities, even though the description says ""3-axis."" The three axes they're talking about are ailerons, elevator, and throttle -- NO RUDDER CONTROL!! I didn't realize this, and so I sent it back as soon as I received it and found out that there was no rudder control... How they can call this a Fighterstick is beyond me... No rudder control? Really? Sent it back... Buying something else, and making darn sure it has rudder control on it..."
3,Insightful for historians,"This book is rather basic in plot and ideas, but it is rather insightful to the people of this country as well as the conditions they faced.I had to read it for a Latin American history class, and im glad I did. I wouldnt recomend it unless you are interested in this country and its history, but if you do have to read it Im certain you will be glad you did."
5,Bought this over a year ago,I still use it almost daily! I LOVE it! I even told other people about it and they have bought it too!
3,"Human, humane, and real","We are in the head and heart of the progragonist, who is very thoughtful and spiritual--but is no saint. One can suffer with her real pain--that of losing touch with her adult children as well as seeing so many other young Jews leave the fold--but also experience her attraction to a younger man, though she loves her husband. Though the book hasn't the ""edge"" of much modern fiction, that is its charm: unself-conscious prose.The Jewish ritual and medical-rescue detail was vivid and enlightening."
3,Not as good as I thought!,After receiving this product from Amazon I was a little dissapointed. The fights were a bit boring. Too much g&p; and not much striking. No extra features that are worth mentioning. The old Pride rules had the first round of 10 minutes.So in a lot fghts the fighters exchange a few strikes and then go to the ground. Not too much is happening there and if there is no submission then you have to wait 10 minutes until the next round starts.The DVD release is plain and simple and I would have expected more of a show. The other bad thing is that on some DVD`s there are 2 sides and you have to switch the DVD.OK I heard that from Pride 13 they changed the rules and it is getting exciting.
3,I wish mine worked,"Cool concept if it worked. I may have a defective one but I dont get power out of the USB end, kind of a bummer but I only paid three dollars so I cant be too upset..."
3,It's not fabulous but it's not horrid.,"Well, the game is easy to beat. Once you do it there is nothing else to do. The minigames are fun but easy. The Oompa Loompa album thing is just some pictures from the movie. All from practically the worse scene."
1,Worthless.,"What I liked about this pizza stone was that it's small and affordable - other stones I've used in the past have just been too large and heavy to handle.But there is something wrong with the finish of this stone - it was ruined on its first use. I followed the instructions to the letter, cleaned it gently after we unpacked it, used plenty of corn meal on the bottom of my crust ... and what I got was a pizza that was welded to the stone. Nothing could get it off. So dinner, and the 30-something dollars I paid for the stone, went right down the drain."
2,Hip but harsh,"This book is written in a hip way, and its writer has had an interesting time getting stoned out of his mind.Unfortunately he is young, cynical and arrogant, and his insights tend to be either shallow or insulting.I think that he will one day regret having revealed how sordid and pointless a lot of the journalism is for his magazine, and how he exploited his expense accounts in a dishonest way.Marijuana is a good plant with many uses, but this author and his magazine promote the wrong image for marijuana and its users, and they are one reason that marijuana is still illegal."
1,Major Disappointment,"I was expecting a book of jazz bass lines. Instead, this was a collection of jazz melodies written in bass clef. Very limited appeal IMO."
1,French Bulldog DVD,This DVD is totally useless and a waste of money. It is poorly made and not very informative. We were left wanting our money back. And we bought it used at $14.99! I don't even want to resell it.
2,scary but not durable,"The costume was scary but only when the pump works to pump blood. Right when it was worn I filled the pump with blood but I noticed that when the heart pump was squeezed the blood didn't drip good enough through the mask. Sure enough the pump has a slit cut so of course it didn't pump because the blood was dripping out. I emailed the company and they couldn't fine another replacement, but they did credit my account for a certain amount for the defect. The costume is nice but the pump is the cool part and if it's going to tear easily then it is not worth the price and worst of all you can't even show your mask off."
2,Better to buy this one in a store.,Item arrived damaged and company did not respond to reqeuests for returning/replacing. Amazon.com refunded my money.
5,Fantastic,I have a daughter that has a passion for coloring books. Bought this as part of a Christmas gift for her and needless to say she was very pleased.
4,The Fashion Show Season 1,Fun premise. Not quite up to the Project Runway series but better than most of the genre. Surprised not a third season.
4,"If you love Project Runway, here's more","Love these shows because of the talented young designers and also because ofthe judge, Isaac Mizrahi. This is so much fun and if you love fashion it's inspiring."
1,Very disapointed with this book,"People who would be interested in this book would expect to see nutritional breakdowns, but this book does not have them.Very strange for a book about healthy eating. I thought the guy-o-meter was just stupid and added nothing . I expected more from this book, and regret buying it."
2,Thin Cooking,"Thin on recipes, thick on her perpective, her life, etc. I like her show on the Foodnetwork but was disappointed in this book. On the positive side - I do like how she has a guy-o-meter and that will influence what I do try. I've had the book a few months and have not tried a single recipe. This is a no frills cookbook and no photos."
5,This Book is Brilliant Regaurdless of Other Reviews,"Kathleen Daelemans has done a wonderful job wriiting this book that has a wealth of information. I have made a few recipes and they were mouthwatering and low cal. There isn't a nutritional breakdown, but it's alright because everything you take in is healthy. It gives you serving sizes, and they are very good portions. We all know that the key to weight lose is portion control. All the information is great and you can feel Kathleen's upbeat personality.I have read the reviews and comments and I believe that they are unjust, and obviously from someone who has zero knowledge of food. Anyhow this book was great for me, the tastes are awsome. All and all this book was a excellent buy."
5,Get the complete set!!!,"My son loves these books. There are four in all and they were priced right at Amazon. The others are Pirateology, Dragonology and Egyptology."
1,"Not what I expected, image did not reflect the product","I have used inflatable hangers for years, I purposely ordered the most expensive product because I thought it had metal hooks, I know the plastic hooks are inferior. My order came with plastic hooks, one cracked as soon as I hung a damp (from the dryer) tee shirt up. If the mfg. has some metal hooks, I would appreciate his sending them to me."
4,Surprisingly touching film,"This film goes back to basic on the meaning of friendship.More than just ""preaching"", this film takes the viewer on a journey to discovering friendships.Wonderful."
5,good,got my item as described and fast shipment i do recommend seller but item is not very durable so if ypu need more protection get something more expensive
2,Limited Quality Viewing Angle,"I purchased this after my 42"" Plasma broke. I decided to get an LCD as I live at an altitude of 6200 ft and have been told that Plasmas are not recommended for such high altitudes.After having a Plasma, the image quality of this LCD comes nowhere close to as being as good. The colors appear more muted. Also, as others here have commented, the colors are further faded as you move anywhere greater than 30 degrees from center. It is a significant fade, not something to discount in your purchasing decision.As I bought this from Costco, I'm returning under their return policy."
1,Right Half of Screen Dark,"I've just got this set, and enjoyed it for 3 days, when suddenly right half of the screen went dark. I was using HDMI input when this problem arose, then I tried several different input, without making any difference. I saw another review that has exact same problem I experienced. Plan to return this set to get a refund, and buy a different brand. All and all it makes a good excuse to return this item since I've just discovered that it doesn't support wide screen resolution for PC input. Only support 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768.. very dissapointing. Wasted my time and effort to mount this set on the wall."
2,song selection a mixed bag,"Ten songs from 1947-52 with various orchestras. Day does a nice job delivering several standards, particularly ""Imagination"", but the other half of the songs are throwaway Lawrence Welk-type material. None of the orchestrations are memorable, and several feature the silly male background vocals that seemed to be a staple of the period (even for Sinatra)."
3,A diffident critique of standard welfare economics,"This slim volume is an edited version of the Royer Lectures that Sen delivered at the University of California at Berkeley in 1986. It is a rather diffident and undifferentiated critique of the reduction of moral reasoning in economics to the Pareto principle, the standard assumption of rationality, and the equation of rationality with self-interest. Sen stresses that welfare is not simply a function of getting what you want, but also of having the power to make your own choices, in addition to having the material products of your choice. This book is superseded, I suggest, by his Development as Freedom (Anchor, 2000)."
2,"Inaccurate title, should be ""Strange Engineering 9"" Rear End","This video does cover the aftermarket Strange Engineering 9"" rear end in excellent detail. However, I was expecting to see a tear down and build up of the most popular hot rodding rear end in use today, the cast iron FORD 9"" rear end. This video concentrated on the center section of an aftermarket aluminum rear end. In my opinion, this video was little more than an advertisement for Strange Engineering and Wildwood Manufacturing. The title of this video is very misleading! I would only recommend it to the hard core racer that intends to use an aftermarket aluminum center section."
5,Highly enjoyable.,"This was a fun book to read and informative on a great many subjects. Mr. Tansey becomes our personal guide as we walk with him on his exploration of archeological sites in the New World. The author carefully adds interesting facts which augment the central theme. Mr. Tansey obviously comes from a time when people enjoyed knowledge just for the sake of knowledge. They enjoyed understanding as much of the world around them as possible. From his diverse educational background he shares with us along our tour features from the world of archeology, early man in the New World, biology, geology, anthropology and paleontology.Reading Tansey's book is like walking the wood with a naturalist. He sees and he shows you what he sees and how he came to see it. And in the bargain, he shows you how to make your own discoveries."
1,A big snooze!,"Neither scholarly nor steamy. The book is filled with tepid interveiws with gay navy men and it reveals little about what gay life is in the navy (or is not.) Sometimes, Zeeland seems to get into telling us a bit more about himself as a chaser of military men. It would have been more interesting if he had spoke with veterans from the navy who could offer more insight then these shallow boys.Disappointing."
3,"Basic, but easy to read","I'm a CRNA who has been practicing for one year. I was put in a positon to perform primarily cardiac anesthesia. I purchased this book to enhance what I learned in school and at work.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who understands the basics of cardiac anesthesia. It is more of a reference for those who are in their residency or first years of anesthesia.Overall there are probably more comprehensive texts, but it only took me about 4 hrs. to read through this text and I'm not a fast reader."
5,Works like a charm,"I did a lot of research before settling on this battery tester. It is compact, gives an accurate percentage of power remaining reading and is easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a great battery tester. The only downside to this product is that it needs 4 AAA batteries. Most battery testers don't require batteries to operate. It's a small complaint however."
5,"Great tool, worth every penny","I've been looking for a tester than I could feel confident in the results for awhile, I went though several cheap ones that didn't seem reliable. They would say a battery was 90% capacity and when tried in even the low load applications (tv remotes, wireless mice) They would die instantly. This tester has yet to let me down."
3,It works.,"It works, it works well. But the build is cheap. Battery cover on the back feels like it is made of paper. The battery springs in the back are not well aligned.And I am slightly worried about the ground probe, since it is the most used moving part, and not really a very strong part of the device.I kinda expected more for how much it cost."
2,Not one of Joan's best...,"I'm a huge fan of some of Joan Wolf's books, particularly her early ones. Recently, I broke down and spent a few more bucks than usual to purchase ""A Fashionable Affair,"" which was published in 1985. Patsy is a NYC supermodel who turns for help to a childhood friend Michael, a former DOJ accountant, for help with a tax audit. Michael discovers that her manager was financially ripping her off, and the manager's partners come after Patsy and Michael to prevent them from going to the IRS. The book is smoothly written, as are all her books, but doesn't pack an emotional punch. If you're collecting her oldie goldies, spend your money on ""His Lordship's Mistress,"" ""The Scottish Lord,"" and ""Summer Storm."" I've read them countless times, and, each time, I'm impressed with how affecting they are. The best of her more recent works are ""Golden Girl,"" ""The Guardian,"" and ""The Arrangement."""
4,lighting air purifier la 2sp oak,We like the air purifier but I was disappointed with the seller. They sent me a cherry colored one and it had a dent on the front side. I contacted the seller and they never replied. This machine works great for getting rid of unpleasant odors. You use the ozone feature just long enought to get rid of any smells and then turn it off. I just with the filter that is on the back was washable.
3,...made when I was born...,"Amazon says almost nothing about this book, so here are a few facts about it:23 chapters1107 pages""LevelStudents are not assumed to have a previous course on chemistry and mastery only of basic algebra is expected. ... We belive that the level is right for the mainstream general college chemistry course."" -- Chemistry (the study of matter and it's Changes ) by James E. Brady and John R. Holum"
3,"Very conceptual, not very mathematical","When I used this textbook, I was looking for a mathemtical/engineering approach to chemistry. This textbook, however, explains concepts with examples but little or no scientific proofs. I found myself filling in proofs from other courses like thermodynamics and science of materials. Overall, a very thorough book, but heavy on the memorization, and light on math and graphs."
5,Makes the Best Frothy Shake!,"I am always amazed what you can buy here nowadays. I love this mix, and it is so delicious mixed with cold milk. I have been buying this at Asian stores for years and years, and it is so calming and soothing overall and especially when one feels a bit acidy. It is truly a high quality product with a velvety mouth-feel, and I have yet to open a packet and find any variation. I prefer the no-sugar version, but there is regular one also that is quite over-sweet in my opinion."
4,amazon book purchase,theres some highlighting in the first couple of chapters but other than that its in good quality.
5,"Up, Up, Down is a great story for little kids.","Up, Up, Down is a good book because it is funny when Anna fell from the drawer onto her stomach.My favorite part was when Anna fell on her bottom. My favorite character is Anna. She always falls from whatever she climbs.I think the pictures are colorful.The pictures are awesome.I will tell all of my family to read this awesome book."
1,Mass produced GARBAGE.,"First off the auto aim still blows chunks. Good luck when you get into a gun fight with more than 2 enemies. Showpek's review is dead on. It feels like I've played a lot of the mission before...oh yeah vice city.I would recommend this game if you like driving for hours to get from one city to the next, having to dive in the water a few hours just to get you breath status up, having to go to the gym and eat every two seconds gets annoying. For those of you who like bad sequels *cough*Daryl*cough* are mentally retarded clueless gamers that just buy games so their friends think they are cool. The only good thing about this game is that I can use it as a coaster."
1,Not that good,I can't believe the hype around this game. I played Vice City and it was way better. It seemed all R* did was put some new skins on the maps and changed around some of the missions. I felt like I already played the game and was bored in the first hour. Then having to go work out and eat every ten minutes put the nail in the coffin. Graphics are horrible ps1 style. I really would give this game 2 stars but I need to bring down the average so people will have a better picture of what the game should really be rated.
3,Before it's gone...,Better pick up the M version quick- other retail outlets have pulled it over its recently uncovered sexual explicity. This version is bound to become a collector's item...
3,Not old enough...,If you are looking for a truly old fashioned cookbook that would predate the use of sugar I do not recommend this book.
3,not complete season,"I love the show it self, and couldn't wait to have my own copy of Season 3, but this is the ""best"" of season 3. This was advertised incorrectly."
3,standard,"My rest broke a while back and I just needed a suitable one that will get the job done. Its not the most comfortable, but its good for the price and it keeps my posture right."
3,"Nice to have, but not their best","I bought this album because I am a huge fan of Faithless and it was their only CD that I didn't own, but It's not their best. It's ok, but nothing really special. I would highly recommend ""No Roots"" or ""Outrospective"" over this album, cause they are much better."
3,Okay tagger,"After working in retail for a couple of years I can honestly say this tagging gun is no professional tagging gun, but it works fine once you get the hang of it. It's a good value for the cost and it comes with plenty of the plastic attachers!"
4,God's Passionate Desire,This is an excellent book of meditations that moves one closer to actually experiencing God's love for him.
2,It does makes you think ...¿Por qué?,"Like most of Riberi's work it's beautifully shaped and elegantly crafted but bordering on the overly sculptured. Having just finished with his piece I am left with a feeling of deep unfulfilment which I cannot really explain. Read his other works especially Fictions as Cognitive Artefacts: the Case of Jorge Luis Borges' ""Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius' (Magnolia Press - nice cover in hardback edition) for which I must congratulate the author and you will understand why."
2,Who will survive to graduate?,"After a track star collapses and dies after a meet, her teammates start following her example. The assailant appears to be the coach, but is it? Nothing much to report here; pretty bland stuff but there are some good scary scenes toward the end. Christopher George is particularly fine and watch for a young Vanna White. One of the least of the holiday-themed slasher films."
2,an okay slasher film!,"Members of the track team begin to die. Why? Seems a girl on the track team got a blood clot and died at a track meet. Her boyfriend decides to butcher the whole track team, and a few others. Not the worst horror film around, but I've seen much better. The movie is notable for an appearance of Vanna White, and an early role for scream queen Lennea Quigley."
2,Good Thing It's Cheap...,"The only thing worse than the script, acting, plot and production values of this horror cash-in is the DVD transfer. I could've done better recording LP mode on a VCR...25 years ago. I'm a sucker for grade-Z films made on the cheap over a long weekend, but even this one tests my limits. Still, it's fun to have it as part of the ""anniversary"" horror-themed movie collection if for nothing else than Vanna White's screen debut. Even at $5, though, it's overpriced by half."
3,Pretty good product at a good price,"Product fits tightly, functions well, & seems to protect the phone well. Looks a little odd to me due to clear plastic extending around the sides of the top, but momma likes it so I'm satisfied."
4,Serves the purpose -- but could be better,"I had a tough time getting the phone into the case -- since they have tried to get it to fit snugly. As soon as I fitted the case after a struggle, I kept on getting a weird, ""No voice memo recorded"" type of message. It took me some time to realize that this was because the case was pushing against one of the buttons on the side.If you get this case, just try to stretch it out a little bit before trying to force the phone in. Once you get the phone in and are able to avoid it pushing against the buttons on the side, everything is ok. The belt clip is a little too big -- it would have helped if it was a little thinner.I have had this case now for a couple of months and it seems to serve its purpose well."
1,Motorola Leather Case,I ordered this leather case for my husband by mistake. It was not the one that I thought it was. He doesn't like it at all. I had to purchase him another one like mine. It comes in one piece and you really have to struggle to get your phone into it; then the plastic piece that covers your screen gets moisture under it (for no reason at all) and sticks to your display screen. It is soft leather rather than hard. Doesn't really protect your phone at all.
1,"unimaginative design, cheap implementation","Combersome, no clear advantage to using it all.Wasn't even worth sending back"
1,junk,plastic on case tore when phone inserted. thought case was all leather but much of it was clear plastic.
1,Bad product,"I ordered 2 of the item, 1 ripped out of the back and the other would not release the cell phone. I was able by combining both to make 1 adaquate cell phone holder. I do not recommend anyone buy this product."
2,Not the toaster oven I expected from Oster,"My biggest beef with this oven is that it is advertised as a SIX SLICE toaster. There is no way you can fit 6 slices of bread in this over at once. It's a roomy 4 slice at best. 2nd biggest beef is this thing gets REAL HOT on top when you are using it. Hot enough for 2nd degree burns if you aren't careful. Don't leave anything sit on top of it or it will get melted. Finally, the toaster function is not real great. You adjust darkness via the same timer control for timing say a 30 min pot pie. Problem is in the 1-2 min range, it's hard to reproduce consistant results. You really have to watch your toast. The pros? Well, it's very pretty sitting there and it is BLACK with CHROME which is what I needed to match my kitchen and the only reasonable priced one in those colors. So I guess you get what you pay for but I am still disappointed with the fact that you can't really toast 6 slices at once... with 4 kids that's a problem for me."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I took a chance and bought this movie since I use to live in El Paso and visited Mexico often. My biggest problem with this movie was the PROFANE language and the nudity! This type of crap OFFENDS many people and is completely unnecessary. Oh yes, nearly everyone I talk to feels the same way! When will Hollywood realize that they could sell many more DVDs if they offered two versions of a movie? One of course being a family friendly version! The good news is I paid less than a dollar for this crappy movie, so things could have been worse."
4,No chapter on the Mughals,"This book provides a very good account of Islamic art through the ages. However, one of the 'golden' eras of Islamic art and architecture, the Mughal era, has not been treated sufficiently -- it's only been treated tangentially. The Mughals ruled the Indian Subcontinent and adjacent areas for about 500 years, and combined Persian, Arabic, Indian and other styles in a brilliant system of arts. A chapter on them would pretty much complete the book."
2,Smaller than I thought they would be,"I ordered these because the picture made them look about the size I am used to using at the health club, which are a great size for a smaller aqua jog bell. These are however, much smaller than that (and therefore much less resistance - just about none). My health club also tried to buy these thinking they were the same as what they had, and had to return them.I attempted to return them too, but the restocking fee and the return shipping cost would have made that a pointless exercise.I would have given it 2 stars because they might be fine for someone wanting almost no resistance, but took one away for the restocking fee.If these type of items (with % resistance) were consistent across different brands, it might make it easier to buy them online."
3,Nice but..,They're really nice and fit in a 80Gb too.But I have an itrip by dock and when I connect it I have to remove that (on the dock) part of the case and then I can't controle anything because is very difficult with the case out.
5,Old Thunder,Wonderful biography; I really enjoyed this book. Very inspiring and has given me a great motivation to exhaust myself for the good of the Church in imitation of Hilaire Belloc.
5,TERRIFIC FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES!,"I am a dance teacher, currently teaching nursery dance (2-1/2 to 3 year olds) and beginner tap and jazz (3 to 5 year olds). This CD is excellent for use in the classroom. The nursery class especially loves to do The Bunny Hop and the Chicken Dance! The older kids really enjoy YMCA, The Swim and Shout! The Twist is popular in all classes. What a great teaching aid!My 7 year old daughter enjoys doing all of the dances too and we used the music at her birthday party. The kids had a ball. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone."
3,out of date,"I purchased this book yesterday (6-7-2012). I didn't purchase the newer edition of the book because html5 and css3 are not yet supported on all the browsers. I thought this version is more suitable. The topics covered are valid enough. However, it kept mentioning tricks to overcome IE5 problems. Based on my experience, IE6 is currently considered the baseline ""old"" browser with all the CSS implementation problems. As a result, I feel that this book is out of date."
5,A must have for anyone involved in CSS design,"If you believe that CSS should be heavily used when designing web pages (and you know it should be), this is one of the books you simply must read. Packed with realistic examples, problem-solving tips and working code, it was exactly what I was looking for."
5,Great book,"Excellent book, brings up a lot of good accessibility and best practice points. This will make me a better web developer."
3,Great book but missing a page,Great resource for css designers. I particularly enjoyed the section on rounded corners and css without tables. But I did find one thing wrong with it--page 196 is missing from my copy. What happened?
5,Entertaining challenge for linguophiles,"Though the insistence that there really are Klingons might be off-putting to some linguophiles, the work put into developing this OVS artlang justifies a read of the book. Like many initial grammars, there are words and issues of syntax which are overlooked. Yet, the material in this book renders the language usable, especially when coupled with Klingon for the Galactic Traveler (also by Marc Orkand), and can be an entertaining challenge."
5,The Klingon Dictionary,"Ok, you got me, I want to learn Klingon. But it's all good, a true geek should at least be able to know a few phrases in this scary language. If you're into Star Trek, want to learn a new language, or are just a geek, buy this."
3,Imaginitive,"This was a fun game which had a good balance of competitive game play. If you have a child or are a fan of The Johnny Depp movie version, you should buy the game for 5-10$. Worth it!"
2,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"This game is one of very few that had me tossing my controller in frustration. I actually purchased it for my ten-year old son who has to constantly ask me to help him. I like a challenging game but as it is based on a children's movie, I feel it should be a little less difficult to manuever through the levels. My son actually likes the game during the parts that are actually playable without extreme frustration. I would not recommend this game for any but the most patient child."
2,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory PS2,"This has to be the most aggrivating game my children and I have played in 7 years!!!! I'm sick of ""children"" games that children and some adults can't play!!!!!! The graphics and story make a wonderful game - but it stops there!!! Once you start playing you'll need to control yourself from throwing the controller across the room, anything else I could say wouldn't be very nice!"
1,horrible horrible horrible,"This item isnt worth a dime. First it came without the hardware for assembly. Not good when you get it for a christmas gift and its 3 days before christmas. Forget about customer service, it doesnt exist. Then its actually just cheap material thats very flimsy and has already broken. I would stay away from this product."
2,Low end product,"No matter what, this is not a original charger for the Casio, the 4 hours battery will die after 1 hour of usage after fully charge."
1,broken when recieved,I ordered a battery charger and when we recieved it ... it was broken.. not happy at all....
3,I am 50,As I just turned 50 I am looking for information regarding menopause and all the phases a woman around my age goes through. This book started with a lot of information about Ayurveda which I am not really interested in. The rest of the content of the book is good with general information about being healthy and keeping life simple and uncomplicated.
1,I can confirm reports of leaking,"This is our 2nd go at this coffee maker as well. The little guys made great coffee, and they were affordable, but only if you are not buying a new one every 4-5 months. Both of our pots began leaking from the water reservoir ALL OVER the counter after 5 and 4 months, respectively. I will not buy another. I'll buy something that will not fall apart this quickly.P.S. If you ignore me and buy it anyway, be sure not to leave any important papers or electrical appliances near it."
3,"Cheap, but it'll do the job","My two complaints with this coffee maker are:1. The carafe lid is difficult to re-attach after cleaning. The little nubs that allow the lid to move up and down are cheap plastic and are no longer properly shaped.2. Water/condensation does build up under and around the basket, and, as another reviewer said, the water comes down onto the burner or into your pot of coffee when you remove the basket.I guess for $20 this works okay. The coffee tastes fine, I just wish it was a little better constructed."
2,"Tastes LIke Plastic, Me Too...","After brewing several cups of coffee it still tastes like plastic. One time I bought bottled water in a soft bottle and it had the same plastic taste. Customer service rep at the company told me that about 25% of the population has the genetic capability of tasting this plastic. So why do they use it in any product involving food or beverage? Even if you don't taste it, do you want plastic particulates in your coffee? The removable water reservoir is a great idea, but it's slippery and has no grip points. I pour into it with another plastic container. I'm going back to my big 12 cup maker for a high quality brew. Maybe somebody I know who doesn't taste the plastic wants it. I'll give them a warning."
5,Does the trick boys,"If you're a guy and you want to take a prostate herbal supplement, this seems like the way to go. Combines the 3 main herbs associated with prostate health into one supplement. Results are noticeable. Reasonably priced, and from a reliable company...I've purchase herbs directly from them in the past, no complaints. So, what's not to like? I would definitely recommend."
4,"Good quality, but too large for wrist","My husband really likes the watch. It's a great quality product; but, the band is about 2 inches too big. My husband wears a 7 inch bracelet, and this watch was way too big for him. We'll have to get it resized."
4,quality and a good price,"I saw a display model of this tent in a local camping store. It has all the features in the description and would certainly accomodate 2 people and their gear. I ordered one from Amazon before I saw the display model and realized that what I needed was a tent with a rainfly that goes down to the ground as I will be camping in the desert. The roof of the tent is almost entirely mesh, which would certainly help cool it but wouldn't keep the dust out. I think it would be a great summer car camping tent as it's probably too heavy for backpacking."
2,What message was the author trying to convey in the book?,"As a whole the group struggled with the discussion of the book because the group struggled with the book, itself. The group discussed what they thought the meaning behind the title. The author went through a phase in her life as a child where she did not feel beautiful. But as the author evolved along the way she began to feel beautiful on the inside. The group also discussed how important it is to have dreams and how one has to believe in themselves to make those dreams come true. But at the same time, there `are not enough chairs in life for all of us.' Therefore, we have to understand that not everyone will get their dreams fulfilled because there is not enough room for all of us."
4,Slightly cheaper than elsewhere,Purchased this product first in a retail store and ordered from Amazon for about a dollar less. Not a hugh savings but convenient.
1,This product is a cat killer. Mourning another loss to Hartz products.,"This stuff is poison. Yeah, it sure will kill the fleas, right along with your cat. This vile gel separated me from my beloved friend forever. This is the second pet we have lost to Hartz products. We lost one cat in February from Hartz vitamins, and now, literally minutes ago, another to these acursed drops. Do not ever buy Hartz products. I have shared my story on (...), and perhaps if I had seen this website before purchasing them, I could have saved my beatiful lifetime companion. This filth does not deserve even one star."
1,My cats are dead.,"I had a major flea infestation, but didn't expect my cats to die from the Hartz drops. They went into some type of strange seizure, both cats had enlarged pupils- they seemed frozen in time. My cat spent 4 hours in pain, whined, and eventually died. It was terrible to watch. Both cats died the same way. Do not use this product. Remove your cats from the infested home, treat the home, bathe the cats- wait until toxins levels are low or gone, then bring them back home. I lost my cats and you shouldn't have to go through this. :("
5,Inchworm,"I loved this when I was a child, so I bought it for my own daughter. It is fun for the driveway, and it doesn't roll backwards as she tries to go up a hill."
2,Okay for OLDER kids!,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she still hasn't been able to use it. It would be better for much older children as it's VERY hard to ride. It takes a LOT of weight to make the worm actually move up and down so it's extremely hard for a 3 year old to use! I bought it because of how cute it was! Maybe one she is bigger she'll love it.. for now, it's just for decoration! :("
4,"I like the mood of these books, the way he gets into the head of his protagonist is genous.",I always know when I read a Leonard book that the writing will b e good. He is one of the authors I can never get enough of. This character is one of my favorite.
3,nice balance,"Warren Harding has been called Ameridca's worst president but was he really? Yes, there were scandals in his administration but compared to what's been going on in Washington for the last 40 years they look like small potatoes. Yes, he had an affair but he's hardly the only president do so.This short but information packed book gives a good balance to the real life of Harding. This was a man who dared to call for racial fairness in a speech in the Deep South. Harding had been dogged by rumors that he had black ancestry so bringing up the subject at all took a certain amount of courage.History is different from legend and this book does a lot to clear up some old myths. Check it out."
3,William G. Harding: The American Pesidents Series: 29th President,"Lots of good history, but maybe I was turned off by the facts of the corruption during the Harding Administration."
1,I will never order from you or from any other electronic retailer again.,"I had a horrible time with this seller, I ordered a laptop from him for my son for Christmas, it worked for a day, I contacted Leo Systems and he said he was on vacation and not feeling well, he said to have it shipped to his address by January 3rd 2011, I did as he asked and it took 3 weeks to get a replacement after he said he would make sure it was a good working laptop, and he said he felt bad for my son having a bad laptop, and it was his promise to send a new refurbished laptop, or he would fix the one I sent back to him, he sent one back it worked for a few days, After paying for the product and shipping, and then paying the shipping to send it back to him and then getting another one that didn't work, I am very unhappy with this seller!!"
3,ok,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, but it's not quite what I expected in terms of spiritual insights."
1,Only lasted a few months,"This worked fine at first but after a few months, the charger could not hold the AAA batteries in place. The spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the AAA batteries. Thus, I could no longer charge the AAA batteries. Then after a while, the charger just quit working all together."
2,Didn't Like It,"We bought the Rio, thinking we were stepping up from the Sevylor Tahiti we also own. I was disappointed & like the Tahiti better, even though the Tahiti is a cheaper boat.The Rio has a nice, tough hull; a tough fabric shell over an inflatable core. But in the water, it fish-tailed too much. When the wind blew, it blew me & the Rio quickly across the water where I didn't want to go. I think it sits higher in the water than the Tahiti & that's probably why it was at the wind's mercy. Don't know if you can get a skeg for the Rio, but you will need one. We sold our Rio but love our Tahiti."
2,I am Not A Fan Of 1st Person players,"So far, that i am into it. I do not like the fact that it is 1st person. I find it very annoying. But the effects are creepy, and cool. Love the vibrations. Storyline is cool, and mysterious. But overall disappointed by 1st person character player."
1,ACURITE Wireless Weather Thermometer,"I bought my ACU>RITE Wireless Weather Thermometer Model#0078A42 4 months ago and I have had to change the AAA batteries 5 times. The LCD numbers fade quickly and you have to be at the correct angle in order to read them. For the amount of money for the product and continually having to replace batteries, I would rate this a very poor product."
4,almost great,"This album does have most of Gary's best Christmas songs - except for the final track. I put this album in while decorating the house and wrapping presents. The music was great, adding energy and non-traditional ""heard on the radio for the past month already"" background to the festivities until, to my chagrin, this horrible noise starts coming from my speakers...The last track on the album had arrived.Musicians like to throw in that one Doesn't Quite Fit song, don't they? In this case, instead of being able to spin this CD on repeat and enjoy a cool twist on Christmas music, you have to keep in mind that one song needs to be skipped. Keep that remote control handy folks.All that being said, the rest of the songs are great and add a lot of atmosphere. If you like the blues or just want to hear an under appreciated guitarist rip up his Fender doing electric versions of old favorites, then this album is for you."
4,Love this CD,Heard Gary on a website. I love this type of music. Mostly instrumental. A great CD to listen to while driving or just sitting around the house. Made me wish we had a fireplace.
3,RAWR,this lasted longer than the pralines so thats good. but that means it tastes worse ~~~~~. they tasted to ordinary that i couldnt even call em special. only ones that might be unique was the nibs or feuilletine. btw theyre from ny NOT BELGIUM. so they cud be rippin the ~~~ out of u.
2,The Lavender Cookbook,"I really looked forward to this book,and I had hoped that there would besome creative recipes.This book seems to me full of standardrecipes in which lavender has beensubstituted for more commonly used herbs.I am disappointed, but I'll get over it."
2,Rides - the complete first season.,"There are some good images of the cars etc. but overall the narrator uses a monotone presentation and gives all the episodes a very boring overall feel. I would appreciate much more coverage of the ""Rides"" and way less or no coverage of the ""Bling masters`that dominate most episodes."
5,It worked!!,"Recommended for a dry mouth. I was going crazy, but a friend said try this and it worked!!Couldn't be more pleased!!"
4,"Product is great, but service was... eehhhh.","I have used Rice 'n Shine before and have been happy with the results. I'm an avid healthy eater and this product fits the bill. Low in Calories, Fat, and Carbs, yet high in Protein for the serving size. It keeps you feeling full and I have noticed that I have been around sick people all winter and have yet to get sick.The only downfall is the company I purchased from this last time (I always go with the cheapest price on this kind of stuff) didn't fill my order correctly and it took me to call them to get them to send out the rest of the order."
4,Love this cutting board,"It's got enough room to chop anything. You can even roll a pie crust on it. I'd give it five stars but there was a little separation in one of the hand grips. I fixed it with some Rock Hard Putty. And even so, I bought one for my son as a housewarming gift for his first home."
5,"The best, my favorite book in the whole world!","A girl discovers a dollhouse in her grandparents old attic. She finds out the dolls are actually portraying her family. She is convinced the dolls move on their own, but how will she convince others? I loved this book because I love mysteries that are believable, man was this believable! It is an average-paged book, but it took me about a day to read because I couldn't put it down! I wish there was a sequel to this book."
4,The Dollhouse Murders - A Kid's Review,"The reason I read this book is because it was a novel my class was working on. Amy is the main character. She is my favorite because she solves the mystery. She is alert and always on the job to find clues. Amy is sick of taking care of her sister, so she runs away. She goes to her Aunt Clare's house. Aunt Clare is the sister of Amy's dad.Amy found a dollhouse in the attic. It looked the same as Aunt Clare's house and it had every little detail. Aunt Clare hates the dollhouse because it gave her bad memories of her parents dying.My favorite part of this book was when Amy went to the attic to find a blanket. She saw a light in the dollhouse. She was frightened and she hoped it was a mouse, but it wasn't. I do not want to give it all away, but it was spooky.Other kids will like this book. It is a great book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. You never know what is going to happen next."
3,Disappointed!!!,"Felt small booklet didn't live up to it's description. One or two 'sayings' or statements PER PAGE. Last page statement was downright morbid!!!! I wouldn't recommend this 'book'. Other book by Joey Green was a fabulous and fun read. 'Contrary (to popular belief) Interesting 'facts' or myths. LOVED that one. oh well....RPITA, Brick, N.J."
3,American Revolution - Colonial Vessels,A little disappointing - Was not worth the wait. Much of what is written is common sense. What I believe most people interested in Colonial Vessels would already know.
1,Save Your Money,"Many East Front aficionados may be tempted to purchase the companion volume to Colossus Reborn. Having done so, I would advise otherwise. I struggled hard to find some use that I could possibly get out of the book, but there just is virtually nothing of substance here. I can fathom no reason for this volume even to exist and it is a step backwards for the usually good Modern War Studies line of monographs."
2,So-So,"This is another UNvisual QuickPro Guide from Peachpit Press: the screen shots are way too small and must be viewed outside in bright sunshine. At about half-off list price, a case can be made for purchase, if you're a FileMaker junkie (like me). It's (unfortunately) intermediate level, not advanced (as it claims). It covers indexing options, conditional valuelists, textstyle functions, mass update of serial numbers, script parameters, bulk e-mail, importing with scripts, and communicating with a Palm."
4,"Neat Stuffed ""Animal""",Cute stuffed toy I gave to a friend's infant. I thought the white blood cell would be a better choice than a disease or bacteria.
4,Os Trs Malandros in Concert,"""Os Trs Malandros in Concert"" represents a gathering of the some of the best ""pagodeiros"" of Rio (Pagode is a grass-roots type of Samba). The Album was originally intended as a mild-mannered parody of the ""Three Tenors in Concert"", but the effort surpasses anything they may have initially set out to do.Even if you don't speak Portuguese it is worth just for the music, but if you do, it shows how clever lyrics, good samba and excellent production can make an album which is destined to become legendary.Definitely a MUST HAVE if you intend to have a good collection of Brazilian Samba."
5,Exelent Writer- Sharon Creech,"she takes you into the book, you feel like you are the character. i felt like i was Sal and on a mission to find my mother. i cried, laughed and was mad as Sal was. this is a great book for anyone of any age, it touches the soul. Sharon's other works are the same way. she has such a wonderful talent."
1,Read with your child or they should skip,"My 6th grader was required to read this in his class. He came home very upset by the unyieldingly depressing tone of the book, the disturbing description of a stillbirth, the child abandonments that occur throughout, and the affair that the grandmother had. It may be a well-written book, but if your child is younger than 13, I wouldn't suggest this one. If your child's school is requiring it, please read it yourself first and discuss it with your child, no matter what their age. The topics covered are too emotionally charged not to have parent involvement in the discussion. My son hated this book, I think because he was too young for it, as he loves to read."
3,A book worth reading,This book is about an indian girl named Sal. Her mother walked out on her and years later she goes to visit her mother in Idaho with her grandparents. On the long drive there she tells a story about her friend pheobe. Pheobe's story end up really being about her. During her time with Pheobe she learns more about her self and what she wants in life. This book has a surprising ending and it is never boring.
5,Most ecciting book ever written!,"This book is about Sal Hiddle's road trip to Idaho to see her mom by her birthday. It was exciting because it was always so suspenceful. I never wanted to put it down. She meats a girl named pheobe. The notes left for pheobe from the ""lunitic"" realy keep the story going. I liked it because Grams and Gramps always made me laugh. There were sad, funny and interisting parts in the book. There was never a part that I didn't like and that is why I liked the book so much!"
4,In the Course of a Life Time,"This is a great book. It is a comedy, and it has a great plot. It is about a girl and her relationship with her dead mother, her father, and her friend named Pheobe. There is also the wonderful story of Gram and Gramps. They help to make this book both funny and serious. I enjoyed reading this novel."
4,Both Sal and Pheobe have hidden stories about their mothers,"This book is about two stories, one hidden behind the other.When Sal's mother dissapeared one day for Idaho, her father goes to bring her home. When he returns, he sends Sal and her grandparents to Idaho. On the way, Sal tells her grandparents the story of her friend,Pheobe's, missing mother.But when they reach Idaho, Sal's story takes an unexpected turn."
4,Nice Book,"Well everyone may not think that this is a great book, but they are wrong. I think this is a great book. I got into it so much. It was so sad at the end though. I really recomend this book if you're wanting to read a sad and funny book."
5,best Book,This book is filled with excitment and suprises. It is a great book about a girl who struggles her whole life with out a mother.
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"I loved this book.It's about a girl named Sal(Salamanca Hiddle) whose mother mysteriously disappears one day(it isn't fantasy)and she is going to go see her. Although it may be a little confusing at first, everyone will love it. There is an exciting end to the story.Readers of all types will love this book!"
5,Walk two moons,The book will make you laugh and cry at the same time . the book involves a crazy lunatic read.
5,A great book,Walk two moons is a book about a girl that travels with her grand parents to Idaho to visit her mother. While she is traveling she tells her grandparents of a weird experience in ohio with a friend. Mean while she is dreaming back to the days when her mother lived with her in Idaho.
4,Michelle's Review for the Book Walk Two Moons,"This book had a very strong vocabulary. It shot out many different kinds of words that would be harder for younger people.(it is more of a young adult book). I would recommend it to girls more that boys because it is based on the life of a girl. Boys might enjoy the book too but in my opinion it is more of a girl book. During the rising action of the book it tends to get a little boring... You would think that it would just say the words or tell you what will happen in the climax but all of these little things set it off, which became anoying for me. Overall this book wasn't that bad because the ending turned out good."
4,A page turner.,"Great book! A three-in-one tale, really. As Sal, a thirteen-year-old girl from Kentucky, recounts the story of her friend Phoebe's life to her grandparents, we learn about Sal's own journey of coming to terms with reality. At the same time we are offered a peek into the bittersweet life of her whimsical grandparents. To the backdrop of constantly changing scenery during a seven-day trip across the US, we witness Sal's coming of age, guided by her grandparents' constant and unfailing love and devotion to each other and to her. It is a fast paced book, juggling three if not more story lines, but thanks to excellent timing, it breathes patience and gentleness."
4,"good, but a bit depressing","I enjoyed reading Walk Two Moons, but I found it to be quite disturbing. If you are a person who is deeply effected by what you read, I would caution this book. It is very sad throughout and has a sad ending. I think people should be warned before reading a sad book. A lot of people choose to read a book based on the awards it has won or the star-rating. Although this is often a good indicator of the book, it doesn't always give us the kind of information we really want to know. So, I just want to say that Walk Two Moons, in my opinion (of course), is well written and entertaining, but it is depressing. People who are dealing with sadness right now should put it off until later."
1,Walk away from this book,"I have never understood why so many people like the work of this author. She is sentimental, cloying, and seems to mistake idiocy for ""eccentricity."" This book is no exception. How on earth did it win the Newbery Medal?"
1,Why Just Why,I love books and i can reads a 500 page novel in like 4 hours but this was wow. I read this in an advanced reading group in 4th grade . I hated it it was confusing and depressing and well just plain bad . so i thought well 4th grade so i tried reading it again i think that if t was possible i hated it even more
1,I HATED THIS BOOK MORE THAN ANYTHING,"I found this book very creepy and disturbing (yes, I read the whole thing) Most of the people I know love it, but I think it is trash.(one of my friends took my advice and has never read it) I kind of liked one of the other books by Sharon Creech, but this book was downright creepy. I thought that Ms. Cadaver and Pheobe were both disturbing, and the way the author thought. Looking at the other reviews, I am a little disgusted at the ratings. No one will probably listen to my review, but I guess you'll either love it or hate it, I don't know anyone who doesn't love it though. I do not know how it got to be a newberry. Anyways, if you want to hear my advice, don't read it. Signed: a person who appreciates fine literature."
5,great,this book deserves a new berry medal all rightit was wonderful but chasing red bird is better read them both
3,Good book depending on what you want to get out of it,"This book, right from the get go, is serious. If you're looking for fun reading, you might want to look elsewhere. The main character is somewhat depressed and in bad straights. Don't pick this up if you're looking for light reading, but if you're interested in a book that actually has a somewhat meaningful, if heavy plot then go right ahead"
3,"Weird, but some how interesting","Okay, if you are looking for one of those drop dead books...dont read this. No offense to Sharon Creech, becuase I love her books like the Wanderer, but this book was weird. The character in the book never showed much emotion and I think it was a bit boring. not only that but confusing. The lunatic person was just weird becuase the book never said nothing much about her after they found out who it was. Maybe i'm being negative but i wouldn't want to recomend it if I didn't like it that much."
5,The best book EVER,"WALK TWO MOONS is really two stories in one. One of the stories is about sal going to see her mom with her grandma & grandpa. The other storie is about Phoebe ,and it is also about Sal and her mom. You will want to keep reading more and more.I encourage you to read this book!"
5,IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!,"WALK TWO MOONS IS AN AMAZING BOOK OF LOVE, MYSTERY, LAUGHTER AND MUCH MORE. I CAN'T HELP BUT READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I HAVE THIS BOOK AND WHENEVER I JUST READ THE FIRST PAGE, NOTHING CAN STOP ME FROM READING THE NEXT 200 PAGES. SHARON CREECH MAKES THIS BOOK ONE THAT YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. MY SIXTH GRADE TEACHER PASSED THIS BOOK DOWN TO ME, I PASS IT TO MY MOM, MY MOM PASSED IT TO MY DAD AND FROM MY DAD, IT WENT TO HIS WHOLE SIDE OF THE FAMILY. THIS BOOK IS THAT GREAT, AND TRUST ME, BUYING IT OR EVEN JUST READING IT, WILL NOT BE A WASTE. IT IS A SPECTACULAR STORY FOR CHILDREN AND EVEN ADULTS. IF YPU DONT READ IT, YOU WILL BE MISSING OUT ON EVERYTHING THAT A GREAT BOOK SHOULD HAVE, AND EVEN MORE!!!!"
2,lacking,not really worth it unless you are into new designs. get something that really works and is beefier.
3,Look before you buy,"This is a nice book but a lot of the patterns were a little dated. A wide range of patterns and a good book to buy if you want to make a number of basic knitted pieces -- just check it out before you buy. If you have a number of books with mitten patterns, or hat patterns, you may not need this book. The baby and kids clothes are cute, but there is only a few patterns of each.Definitely not the young, trendy styles you may find in another book: it all depends what you are looking for."
3,Sweet Swings--But No Homers,"What this album of pop songs performed by current and former ballplayers lacks in musicality it more than makes up for in curiosity value. And besides raising money for a good cause -- the Major League Baseball Players Trust for Children -- it proves that these jocks can play music better than Mets [hopeful] Garth Brooks can play ball.Among the most musical of the 12 athletes are Astros pitcher Jose Lima, who wrote, produced and sang ""La Gozadera,"" and Yankee Bernie Williams, who plays a subtly jazzy guitar on the instrumental ""Eye of the Storm."" Arizona outfielder Luis Gonzalez plays congas on the R&B-flavored ""Take a Swing,"" and Yankee Paul O'Neill bangs the fences with his drumming on the Springsteen-esque ""Just Like Baseball."" There are whiffs: Pitcher Jack McDowell sounds wan on ""Silence,"" and Hall of Famer Ernie Banks can hardly be heard on ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game.""A fun, unique CD to have and share."
4,Nice practical book,I like this book very much but i think it should mention the produts to use in specific cases.
4,I think this toy is adorable!!!! Chloe F.,"I can't wait to buy this set. It looks adorable and like so much fun for a kid to play with. The spare outfit is so cute, too!! The educational value is good because it promotes nurturing skills in kids. This looks like the ideal doll to carry with you. I wouldn't cram her in a bag, though. Otherwise the product is flawless, but the toy doesn't look very durable, judging by the picture. I think this doll is very cute. I strongly suggest you buy it!"
1,fell into splinters,"One of the pieces were missing in the package, in place was some sort of curious knob. Probably the wood was defective on the bottom piece of pole. The base piece crumpled into splinters as soon as I had it assembled, making it unusable. I probably won't send it back because it'll cost more to mail it than it would be to buy another. Since I've had trouble with internet products that are wooden, I think it'll be worth the trouble to shop in person in the future."
3,Coatrack suits its purpose,"Coatrack looks nice, functions fine. Lighter weight wood than I anticipated, so I wouldn't hang anything heavy on it without balancing it out. But otherwise a nice piece."
1,Tree Stand,"No, I didn't like this tree stand. I wouldn't recommend it. A leg from the stand was missing and it was not the color I had ordered."
3,Pretty good,"It looks somewhat unstable indeed (and one of its upper parts could not be properly fixed), but so far it has worked. I'm hoping it won't break down later either. Otherwise, it's easy to assemble, and nicely finished.Update: As I was moving I had to disassemble the product, and the whole top part is now loose - so that it is rotating around the center line, which is somewhat annoying. I was really cautious when disassembling and transporting it, but it still could not be reassembled perfectly."
5,Excellent,Just as shown easy to assemble and is of good quality. At this price you can't go wrong.MXII
3,"Great quality, amazing price.. EDITED","When I purchased this coat tree I wasn't expecting anything amazing; I just wanted something that would look decent and hold my coat. When the coat tree arrived yesterday I was very surprised at the quality. The coat tree was easy to put together, looked good, and is very sturdy (I'm hanging 3/4 length wool coats on it and it doesnt wobble or tilt). I am very happy with this purchase as the quality far surpasses anything I was expecting to get in this price range.EDIT: The day I got home after writing this review this coat rack broke. I'm not kidding. There seems to be some flaw with the bottom row of hooks. Two of them have broken off completely. The inside where the screw is threaded was completely worn off. Perhaps super glue would get it to hold back in place, but I havent tried as the I now hang my coats on the top hooks to cover up the missing bottom pegs."
1,Very poor quality,"Large crack in middle of post, leg had large crack, collapsed as soon as I put it up. cheaply made."
2,"Wrong one, damaged, poor quality","For one thing, I was shipped the ""coffee"" finish instead of the oak, but mistakes happen, and I think that's understandable. What really bothered me was that the package had obviously been busted open on the side, as it was just taped back up with packing tape. The finish on the coat rack was cracked in many places from top to bottom, but it was the large, gaping crack on the base that resulted from just the gentle pressure of sliding the feet into the grooves, which was the last straw. Luckily, I bought this to drill into in order to create a play stand and perches for my birds. It's still usable for that, so it's not worth the hassle of returning, but had I intended to use this for it's original purpose, I'd have sent it back immediately."
1,"A really bad, unromantic cd","This cd isn't roamntic at all, if you think good music is good music than you shouldn't buy this terrible cd."
5,Great add-on grip.,The product was just as described and fits the gun perfectly. Just what I wanted as I have a larger hand that needed the extra finger grip.
5,Beautiful!,"Nice for the price, as expected. I purchased 2. They fit great with lots of extra room (I'm a size 12-14). I'll probably purchase more colors! I can't wait to wear these on my cruise!"
5,excellent camera,Very nice camera with cool features and ease of use. the auto focus is a bit annoying but that's about it
3,DSC-M1 Zoom Noise,"This camera has a good combination of digital still and video. The Panasonic AV-100 does a better job on the video but doesn't even come close on the still. I would have given this camera a perfect score except for one very large gripe, if you zoom while shooting video, the noise from the zoom is very noticeable on playback."
2,Soft focus is an understatement,"The majority of stills I've taken with the M1 are horribly blurred. When a camera can't get a sharp picture on the beach at high noon you know you've got a problem. I was using my friends cheapo camera cell phone the other day and it was able to capture sharper fotos. The video works great, but there is a major problem in the still department."
5,Intriguing,"What a wonderful CD! Growing up in the Peruvian jungle, the daughter of Wycliffe missionaries, I found a real connection to this project. The music spoke to my very soul, recalling some of my most favorite childhood memories. I have known Mr. Miller for some 14 years and this is by far the most intriguing and emotionally compelling project I have ever heard. The blend of ethnic flutes, guitars and exotic precussions truly makes this CD a musical masterpiece. ~T"
3,It's tough to get old,"When I found this re-issue, I was ecstatic because of its rarity. However, in 1965 (the year the album was originally recorded) Louis was becoming a has-been, and though she tries, Gia Maione is no Keely Smith. The banter between the two seems forced, though ""The Pefect Nanny"" has some fun to it. The only recording that REALLY stands out are Prima's romps through ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" and the English version of ""Stay Awake"" thanks to his excitement on the song, and the driving beat of drummer Jimmy Vincent and the horn section of the Witnesses made up of Sam Butera (Tenor Sax), Lou Sino (Trombone), and Morgan Thomas (trumpet/trombone/sax). If you're a Prima finatic, this CD is definitely for you. For those who dig the tunes with drive such as ""Just A Gigolo"" or ""Jump, Jive, An' Wail,"" you're better off digging Capitol or Dot Records."
5,Simple cable. It works,I guess not much to review here except that this cable connects your RAID card to your SATA drives. It works.
3,gave as a gift,I was surprised at how little Tinkerbell was and how little was included in this purchase. The child didn't seem to take to it strongly. Looked easily breakable.
5,The Best!,"I discovered these chips while on a trip in Stamford, CT. I have loved Stacy's pita chips for a while - so when I saw the bagel chips I was thrilled. They are even better than the pita chips! My only complaint is that I had to order them because they are not available in my area. Also, they are kind of pricey - but for special occasions they are totally the best!!"
3,Installation takes a lot of work,"If you don't mind spending a little more money go ahead and buy the original BMW Windshield Washer Pump. I had to spend several hours to make this work. The cable colors are different than the ones on the car and I had to switch them around several times to find out if they are working and the plastic cable connectors (I don't know what's their real name) doesn't easily get connected to the BMW cables. I ended up cutting the cable skin by a knife and wrapping it around the washer pump cables.It's been on the car for a few weeks and so far it's working ok. However the water doesn't go as high in the window as the original OEM pump, but it does the job for $20."
2,I wish I could have liked it,"I had heard this book was really good and so I had kind of high hopes. However, actually reading it was kind of a chore, which I guess technically it was because it was an actual assignment for my autobiography class, lol. I didn't really like how she wove Chinese mythology into her writing style. I know it was supposed to be magical realism but I just felt kind of confused and bored. Also, I just found myself not really caring about her life. I feel weird saying that but I just couldn't connect with her."
1,stop......major boredom ahead,"I have just started reading the book and already im wishing i never picked it up. I cant believe English teachers could make their students read such a boring book. Kingston completely distorts all of the myths that belong to the chinese culture. I can't believe a member of the chinese culture could change facts around and make interesting, wonderful myths of the chinese culture seem almost ugly. It almost like she is try to hard to show the bads things of her culture"
4,Really quite good...,"Had to read this book for my English class, and was quite taken aback with Hong Kingston's style - very interesting. I really liked the book - she uses some great imagery and manages to inspire... which is quite an accomplishment."
3,thought provoking book about the womes search for identity,"I don't think i'd read it again, because of the way the story is told - through the telling of stories, with no actual plot. However, it was worthy of my time. It was interesting to hear of how women and children grew up with these strict rules, and also how they were punished for not following the rules. It was definately interesting."
2,educational BUT confusing at times,"I'm a ninth grader in California which is where this book takes place. To me, this book was an educational book but it wasn't interesting enough to continue on. I'm reading this book with a group our teacher made up called ""Literature Circles."" Here are their thoughts: I am also a ninth grader and i think that this book is alright. I also think that the author stereotypes about asians. She made the book seem like all asians are prejudice. Some parts of the book are very confusing and she does change the subject a lot."
4,Simply Marvelous!,The bravery of her mother is almost unimaginable. The story displays the strength of women that most people believe doesn't exist. It also contrasts the difference in roles of women in America to China.
1,Hated It,"This book was the single biggest waste of time in the last 10 years of my life. I kept reading knowing it couldn't get any worse, it never got any better. I didn't get, it didn't make any sense and wasn't even interesting. 209 pages of crap!"
1,A contrived novel full of blatant misconceptions,"I read this book because my English 12AP teacher recommended itto me personally. Well, I got the book, read it, and absolutely hateit. Kingston's portrayal of Chinese history and lore is horribly distorted and I don't appreciate the cracked glass through which she describes Chinese culture. She mashes up everything whether it be good, bad or insignificant. Her writing style is boring and so obviously contrived. As a Chinese-American I am disgusted with Hong. The book probably appeals to Americans because it supports their ignorant stereotypes about Chinese culture. That's all."
4,Excellent,"Written by a prominent figure of Chinese-Americans, this is a definite read for anyone interested in a real perspective of immigrant life in the U.S."
2,At least she's better than...,"...Amy Tan. But, they both have something in common: they misrepresent Asians. I don't expect a lot of white people to understand what Kingston has done to Chinese culture, nor do I expect white washed Asians to understand either. But, they should look up the real culture themselves and see if what Kingston is doing is right or wrong. And, I'm sure they'll find out that she is wrong."
1,"horrible, awful, disgusting, and a waste of time","I had to read this book for my tenth grade GT English class. I thouht it was absolutley awful, and also really disgusting. The narrator changes every 10 pages and starts telling a totally different story, all of which are boring. You never have any idea what is going on in this book. Reading it was a huge waste of time."
3,More like 3 and a half,"Kingston's book has some fantastic passages that tie you tightly to the page, but, unfortunatly, inbetween these gripping moments, her thoughts and words drift in a random fashion that makes it difficult to pay attention.The book is divided into four sections, interweaving myth, reality, history and present day (well, the present day of the narration)into a fragmented portrait of Chinese/Chinese-American culture.At times, the narrative is amazingly insightful, I found myself learning a lot about Kingston and her families displacement. At other times I felt lost, and had a difficult time digesting the words. (I would get to the bottom of the page and realize I had been thinking about something else).I recommend this book; when her narrative sticks to the story at hand, it's a wonderful, thought provoking account. The parts that drag or more to the point lose themselves don't by any means weigh out the good."
2,good but confusing a maxine kingston,well i thought that the book was not very well written. my momasked me to read it and i said yeah ok well i thought that it wasporley written especilly when she gets raped i thought that that was a big lie no one gets raped no a days. i fell bad but over all i thought that it was a waste of my time and i suggest tale of two cities it is a great book and well written. and i love moby dick it is a great book way better written then this stupid book ok well i am the voice of the future and telling you to not read this over priced sell down book thanks
3,Powerful yet confusing,"I had to read Woman Warrior for my college English class. If it wasn't for that reason I would have never picked it up. I must admit that MHK is a wonderful writer, however this book moves between fantasy and reality within a blink of an eye. If she would have taken more time to explain things I believe my entire English class would have appreciated this book."
1,Preying On The Collectors Out There,"Cheers to Mr. Hockinson for providing a truthful, yet comical, review of this book. Take his advice and save your eyesight, as well as your money. Don't succumb to the urge to fill out your collection by buying books you probably already have in more readable type. Just as Star Trek: The Original Series DVD Collection was sold as two episode discs and now is offered in Season Sets, repackaging stunts are aimed at getting fans to own multiple copies of their favorites. Live Long And Prosper!"
1,DIRECTED BY AN IMBECILE. WHAT A WASTE...,"Want to see close-ups of audience members, stagehands, and background musicians working keyboards, drums and synthesizers - while Bjork sings OFFscreen? Then you've come to the right place. Could have been a glorious concert film, but unfortunately the moronic film editor seems to be interested in everything EXCEPT Bjork! Time and time again, while Bjork is hitting the high notes of an impassioned stage performance - the camera cuts AWAY from her and the lens is directed elsewhere.Just what you always wanted: ENDLESS footage of fingers working the dials on an amplifier or a drum machine or some goddamned thing, while Bjork sings her heart out - OUT of camera range, that is. This DVD will leave you exasperated and furious. I was ready to strangle the cameraman after viewing the $%&*@ thing. If I'd just wanted to hear her voice I'd have played the CD. You should too. Save your money."
1,Slow service,I would tell you how I liked this product if I had actually received it.I just hope I receive it before my son graduates (3 weeks) so that I can give it to him as a graduation present. I took a chance with an outside vendor and paid the extra shipping only to be dissappointed by toooo slow of service.
4,creme brulee perfect,"these bowls are great, i've used them for creme brulee and staging ingredients in baking. they are a bit on the smaller side but that makes for more servings of creme brulee"
1,chipped and broken,"6 ramekins - 1 broken, 1 chipped. This was a gift - I did not have time to go through the return policy and still give in time as a gift. Gave 4 as gift. Obviously packaging was a problem for this glass ware item."
4,wasnt the right size,"when I ordered these I thought that they were bigger than what came. I got them to make miniature pies in, but they werent the right size..they are more for using to put pudding in or salsa. I kept them but had to buy some others at a local store."
2,Nice but bad packaging!,"One of the ramekins came completely cracked. Very poor packaging for such fragile items! Too much hassle to return for one ramekin. Otherwise, the ramekins look nice!"
1,Does for military history what von Daniken did for space science...,"Many years ago, Dorthy Parker reviewed a publication by opening with ""This is what you might call a gift book--you wouldn't take it under any other circumstances"". I acquired this volume similarly.Mr Georg takes any number of items minor related to known existing projects and extrapolates them into major 'what-if's, implying that the Reich actually possessed function prototypes of atomic/radiological weapons. Arguably, the most absurd item he throws out is the suggestion that that the fission bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the USAAF were the direct outgrowth of the scientists, hardware and information captured by the US and British forces at the close of the fighting in Europe.Unless you're a serious Wermacht '46 modeler or wargamer looking for new material, I strongly recommend that you save your money."
2,Not for ectopic pregnancy...,"If you have had an ectopic pregnancy, do not purchase this book! While blighted ovums and molar pregnancies are devastating occurances, they are very different than ectopic pregnancies. This book groups the three together, even mentioning them as ""a mass of tissue"". My ectopic pregnancy was 14 weeks, and he was anything but tissue. I found this book to very insensitive on the loss of a pregnancy due to ectopic. True that the woman's health is important in this type of pregnancy, but the book seemed to only focus on this aspect of ectopic pregnancy."
4,This book helped me to realize I am not alone,"This was a good book for people who have experienced 1 or more miscarriages. It does not have to be read cover to cover. Each chapter is a separate entity, you only need (or want) to read the chapters that are applicable to your situation. It was a book that made me feel as though I was not alone in this situation."
1,Top is made out of crappy wood!,"The moment I opened the case and looked at the guitar top, I realized that there are many unusual pits all along one side as if the top was made out of some wood partly eaten by insects. I was very frustrating and did not even look at other things! I contacted the seller and they told me it's not a manufacture defect, IT IS JUST THE WOOD THEY USE FOR THIS GUITAR!!I returned the guitar and as a result lost 18$ for shipping (the company was kind enough to send me a return label)Youtube ""Brad Davis Demonstrates a Takamine Jasmine S33"". If you look at the top very closely you can see those marks towards the neck. That guitar of course is handpicked because mine had those marks all over one side. So there is no guarantee yours will be as good. Spend some more money and get a more decent guitar!"
4,a little overpriced,the jewelry box is very nice- it just was a little more expensive than it looks like it should be.
3,Disappointing Quality,"I think a jewelry box may be something which has to be purchased on sight. I was disappointed in this box when I saw the quality and would have noticed little things up front.The hinge on the back is basically non existent I don't anticipate it lasting long. The material of the box itself is cheep and spotty.If you're looking for a box to just keep stuff in, this would be okay. If you're looking for a quality box, this is not it."
3,I love this album,"Larry Groce is the singer in this series and his voice is very friendly and sedating. I've loved his music since I was four years old and I still do. The sound of his voice relaxes me and even helps me sleep at night. The song ""I'm a Policeman"" is a good sedative for me and I recommend it to other children and their families. Larry is a good man and a pleasant singer."
3,"It's okay, but it could be better.","I bought this lightsaber thinking it would be fun to have one that extended and lit-up, but it's not all it's cracked up to be.(I'm a 12 year old girl by the way.) First of all, yes, it extends, but you have to sort of pull it out to the longest extent yourself, you can't really just flick it out and be done.2. (Unlike the non-light up lightsabers) When you push the blade back into the base, it doesn't click into it, it very, very easily slides out.3. It lights up, but the light is really dim.I already own a lightsaber that isn't StarWars brand, and the light is much brighter, (although it doesn't extend) but it could be fun anyway! (Just a little side note, the ""blade"" isn't as hard plastic as the non-light up lightsabers, so if your looking for a tougher lightsaber for a battling Jedi Knight, I'd choose the lightsaber that doesn't light up.)"
2,Its costume quality i.e poor,"I was not expecting much for the price but this is very cheaply made costume quality item. I think it would be fair to indicate that in the description. Instead it is described as ""durable plastic for non-stop action! "".My first lightsaber broke after we just put the batteries in to test it. The switch got stuck in the on position so the only way to turn it off was to remove the batteries. The replacement worked well enough to make it through halloween. But it still had the tiny soft metal screws on the battery compartment that you have to be very careful with because its so easy to strip the thread because the metal is so soft."
2,Very disapointed,I bought this phone because I own an AT&T and was so happy with the sound quality. It has so many features. The recording device is so clear and it was easy to set and program. I was very happy with it up until I made a call. There is a constant and distracting buzzing as well as static. I bought this phone yesterday and will return it today. If you don't mind the static and want an inexpensive phone everything else works well.I ave tried several phone/ans machine combos and have come to the conclusion that you have to spend at least $90.00 to get good quality on all of the parts.
1,Don't be Duped,"My husband and I thought this would be a neat phone and it does have some cool features, but what good is that when all your conversations are drowned out by constant static? We changed the channel dozens of time and even tried to relocate it to another part of the house: all the things the little book tells you to try. It's just POOR quality sound. I'll stick with my little Uniden any day, which is getting excellent sound in the same house."
3,One step beyond,"Incubus seems to have found their sound, using lots of acoustic guitars and strings. The ""Rock"" songs aren't so noisy and the singer doesn't scream, but sing, and very well!!...The first listening was boring, but now I'm beginning to like it. Anyway I miss more rock and less balads on the record. Could have been better, but... I still prefer SCIENCE and Make Youself.Anyway, the cd is worthy. All Incubus fans will enjoy it. Excepting ""Aqueous Transmission"", a horrible song!"
1,This CD gets worse everytime you listen to it.,"I wrote a review of this yesterday, but now that I've listened to it again it even worse. BUY SCIENCE! and then buy this and tell me that they have not ""soldout, because they definately haven't matured. BUY SCIENCE!"
3,Not Bad,"Not bad, an average album, only good song is Wish you were here, but if you want something similar to incubus, check out Hoobastank, they are really good."
1,a rushed album,"Morning view doesn't follow up to incubus's last album.The album has a few good songs, like ""I wish you were here,""but the rest of the tracks seemed to have been rushed.Let's just hope that Incubus will take more time in therecording of their next album."
5,For those who dislike Morning View,"I listened to incubus long before their success with Make Yourself, and my opinion is that for anyone who dislikes Morning View, you don't know who incubus really is.They are progressive, and they change their sound with every record,while still keeping their roots,proving they can play all types of music and this is just the next phase for them.If you don't like this one,then you were kidding yourself when you said you did like them.You just jumped on the bandwagon.This is the most inspiring and creative band out there,and the best damn live band that i've ever seen.I anticipated Morning View for a long time, and wasn't the slightest bit disappointed. Solid record from beginning to end."
4,Nice to know this CD,"I, along with countless others I'm sure, tend to buy a CD based on the strength of one or maybe two songs. I did this with Morning View for ""Wish You Were Here"". I quickly found that I play that track far less than all of the others here.These guys rock! I'm blown away with their maturity and talent. I'm not really into any of Incubus' so-called ""peer bands"" so it's hard to make a comparison. I can say that on its own, Morning View is a stellar CD I count among my favorites in my collection. My two favorites are ""Warning"" and ""Just A Phase"", but plenty more than these two and the radio hits."
1,CD's and Vinyl are two different things...,"Incubus is awesome, but when my package came in the mail it was not a vinyl. It was a used CD with a crack in the cover. This was supposed to be a Chrismas gift so of course I am very upset about this. CD's and vinyl are two totally different things to anyone who didn't know!"
5,Incubus ROCKS,"I feel left out to have just learned of this band recently, but I am making up for lost time, I assure you! Not knowing a whole lot about the background of the band, I can say their music is quite interesting and complex. It combines many rockin' songs with some mellow ones for what I think makes a great balance. They also use very complex instrumentation and their mixing is superb. I have heard many of their songs from different sources and find them to be very enjoyable and diverse. ROCK ON!"
5,Incubus Rules!!!,"This album is multilayered musically and so intelligent & sweet lyrically that you can't help but be impressed,chalk up another out of this world album for a band that never ceases to amaze !!If you loved ""S.C.I.E.NC.E"" and ""Make Yourself"" as much as me you'll definately enjoy this album."
2,Horrible.,"Horrible, nothing like the old days,hopefully next CD will be better. BTW, their not so hot live either :-\"
2,The musical equivalent of !$#*ing your pants,"We've all done it at one time or another, and that's ok... but the only option you really have when it happens is to clean up and move on."
4,nice work incubus,"if you lie incubus' less-edgy work (i.e stellar, drive, pardon me...) you'll like this album a lot. its sorta mellow, very introspective. great music."
1,Poor Incubus,"I am sorry to say but this is by far the worst incubus album. They seem to be living of the pattern of Drive and ignore what really made them special. Their funk roots from their Previous albums like Fungus Amoungus, Enjoy Incubus and ever Make Yourself have almost toatally been left behind. In fact i would call this an album for love starved 14 year old girls.Weak incubus Weak."
2,Sellouts,"Incubus used to be my favorite band. Fungus Amongus, Enjoy Incubus, SCIENCE, barely Make Yourself, but how could they sellout? Morning Veiw (besides its stupid name) shows the least talented part of Incubus. No one looks for talent anymore, just how thw band members are. All of the members are starting to look like Backstreet Boys. I just can't believe what they did."
3,im not sure about this one.......,"Well, its finally here, after all the waiting, Morning View has arrived. I have listened to the entire cd twice now, and thats about all i can take. The editorial review puts it correctly. Some may call it selling out, but others think they are growing up. Heres my view. They have sold out. A few tracks go back to the old stuff, but most are acoustic, which isnt necessarily bad, many people like it, but certainly isnt what they used to be. I would still recommend this cd, i just do not like it because im not a fan of this genre of music, the acoustic stuff, not the old incubus. Anyways, if you want a great band that will never sell out, i highly recommend Tool. IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT."
5,IF YOU DONT LOVE THIS CD THER IS DEFINATLY A FUNGUS AMOUNG U,I AM EXTRMILY PICKY TO WHAT I LISTEN TO I ONLY LOVE THE AMAZING TALENT FROM 311 AND INCUBUS ETC.... THUS YOU MUST BUY THIS CD FOR YOURSELF NOT TO MENTION THAT THIS IS WITH OUT A DOUBT THE BEST WORK FROM BRENDON WITH MORE MELLOW AND FANTASTIC RHYTHEMS WITH NEW SOUNDS MAKES IT 10X BETTER. KEEP IT REAL AND MAKE YOURSELF. PEACE T
4,Great rock album .. Best rock I've heard lately,"I dunno about most of y'all out there but I've been somewhat disappointed in most of what he's been hearing lately from so called rock bands. Morning View has def. revived my faith in rock groups. With most of modern rock bands floppin on their follow up to their big hits in my opinion Incubus brings you what you want while not sounding stale. I'm sure y'all heard Wish You Were Hear so I don't have to tell you how good it is, Warning is an awesome song, great lyrics, great music. Song# 13 (i forget the title right now) is an awesome trip down the river of music. I'm not selling the rest of the songs short, but this album has what I've been lookin for in a new release by a band on the high-tails of a smash album (Make Yourself). Personally I think this album is a lot better than Make Yourself. SO STOP SLEEPIN AND GET IT!!!"
4,Not Bad At All,I was disappointed in their last album but this album was quite different. I have to say most of the songs on this album and enjoyable and I've listened to over and over again. With all their good stuff hopefully they'll make a greatest hits album sometime in the future they've got enough hits to do so and this album just adds to those other great songs. I'd buy this one if I were you. You won't regret it.
2,Another sigh,"Maybe it's just because I used to love Incubus and they broke my heart, but I couldn't take this radio-friendly MOR mish-mash. Nice to know you - goodbye. At least they have a positive view of life; that's exceptionally rare these days."
1,this is not what i expected,"i bought this cd with high expectations. i thought that after make yourself i would hear something more close to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or even maybe fungusamungus and enjoy incubus, the best of them all. What i heard was not the incubus i once knew. what i heard was something more like various other bands today, such as Hoobastank..., they sound like hoobastank and all the other emotional music out there now. This cd is not compleatly awful, but most of the tracks are uninspired and forgettable, unlike the previous albums which featured unique and generally strange but good lyrics. This cd has a few good tracks, but the best is definatly circles, which is remenisant of better days. On the whole, i would not recommend this cd. Why? because older incubus is much better...."
4,Not bad....a little slow and soft for my taste.....,"BUT I LOVE THE SONG ""BLOOD ON THE GROUND"". Buy this cd if only to have this song, it is most definately worth it. The lyrics positively shine. Other songs are quite good, too --- Circles, Wish You Were Here, Just a Phase, 11am, Nice To Know You"
2,Apocalypse Never,"Despite its claims, this documentary does not in fact prove that every time Apple comes out with a new product, Armageddon will follow. As I write, the iPad 3 has come to market and the heavens did not fall."
2,Disappointing,"I'm always on the lookout for good examples of the ""Heroic Bloodshed"" genre of Hong Kong action films. I had heard about this film off and on over the years and finally decided to check it out. Unfortunately, ""Hero of Tomorrow"" has none of the qualities that make ""Hard Boiled"" and ""The Killer"" so spectacular. The story is muddled and uninteresting and what few action sequences there are come nowhere close to the bullet ballets of John Woo. Very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this iron just over a month ago and it no longer works. My experiences with this iron are: 1) It makes a very annoying ticking sound when it is off; 2)The dial to turn it off and on broke so now it just goes around and around; 3)It leaks; and (4) It no longer heats up.
1,Don't Buy,"We were looking to replace an old iron and liked the features listed on the box. Auto shut-off, the ready indicator, self-clean feature, and the steaming options. What they don't put on the box is how annoying the beeping ready indicator and the warning beep that the iron is about to shut off, the three beeps indicating that the iron has shut off, and the annoying clicking sound it makes when it is plugged in but is shut off. These in addition to the leaking feature make this iron very hard to have and make ironing more of an annoying chore."
4,A Taste of Texas,"This collection pulls the reader back in time to a small Texas town at the mercy of the fickle oil industry. Giggles, tears, anger, compassion, all are invoked by the vivid characters and detailed settings described in Barnes's heavy Texan voice. He is a terrific storyteller, and I eagerly await his next book."
3,These were a gift for my son,"He hasn't come in to visit so we havn't been able to try them out yet. I use Hogues on my S&W 44 mag and love them. But, these install a little diferently so we shall see."
5,Very Pleased,The Hogue Grip I put on my S&W K Model. I was very impressed how they mounted without the use of the threaded bolt.They pry on very easy with the clamp that is encluded. It has a uniform and snug fit. Best Grip I've bought yet. Thanks
3,"An exciting read, but the books are small short paperbacks","I have to say I really enjoyed the books, but wished they were longer. The accounts give you a really good feel of what it was like to be a tank gunner in the German army towards the end of the war. Some of the accounts are quite exciting. But the two books are very small paperbacks with very large print. Think of them as more longer magazine articles than books. Some of the photos are duplicated in both so don't buy it for the graphics. I like reading first hand accounts much more so than high level tactical material, and this fit the bill."
5,very good,"just as it's advertised: lightweight, easy to put together, very sturdy, and very open. It's a great addition to my office. Doesn't clutter up the place with excessive metal and goes with almost everything."
1,The Boredom Caused By This Film Is No Laughing Matter,"I'm a huge Suzanne Somers fan, so I naturally ran to the video store when my friend told me that she appears topless, mind you briefly, in her newest film ""No Laughing Matter"". I was gravely mislead. This is all PG 'n stuff. Save your [amt.] for the deluxe ""Step by Step"" dvd boxed set my friend told me they will be releasing in early 2002. SS4ever! Peace out!"
5,The King of Rock is back!,"This album truly is a gem in the Ozzy collection. Ozzy shows that he does not need to sell out and give into the masses as so many other classic rockers have. He has retained his original, heavy metal sound with that dark edge to it that could only be Ozzy.The first track, Gets Me Through, is undoubtably one of thr best in the album, but contrary to the review, I beleive many other tracks live up to it. The second track, Facing Hell and the fourth, No Easy Way Out are both awesome rockers, while the third track Dreamer is almost reminiscent of Mama I'm Coming Home, showing a bit of Ozzy's the softer side.With not a filler in the bunch and a great track to end the album as well, this is a killer CD. Recommended to any Ozzy fan."
2,Definitely a Step Backwards,"Summary:Track 3:No Easy Way Out is decentTrack 1 :Gets Me Through is decentAll the rest in my opinion,is pretty much awful.His pattern is to put a few good albums and then put out a bad one.The good news is that usually following a bad one comes an excellent one..I can't wait until that time.For now I'll stick with his previous stuff.Here's how I rank this album with some of the others;1)Diary of A Madman2)No More Tears3)Blizzard of Ozz4)Ozzmosis5)Bark at the Moon6)Speak of the Devil7)Tribute8)Ultimate Sin9)Down to Earth10)No Rest For The WickedAs you can see,I feel this one nears the bottom of the barrel..Definitely not Ozzy's best effort.I believe he needs to stop trying to get that ""modern sound"" and go back to what he has always done best in the past,which is write rocking songs with excellent hooks and melodies ...He needs to focus on his core market ;the 28-40 year old groupthat grew up listening to him and Sabbath..That's where the money is..."
5,"""Absolutely breathtaking""","This new ozzy cd is the best, a great triumphant return by the king of rock! ozzy is in the business again."
2,Decent Album But Songs Are Definately Not Memorable,"This is a decent album but the songs don't have the consistency, spark, or energy of past albums. The flaw is due the fact that on this album, the producer, Tim Palmer, and people like Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) wrote most of the guitar tracks. At the last minute, they brought in Zakk Wylde to basically play as a studio musician and give the songs some balls. (ala No Rest for the Wicked & the No More Tears albums). Zakk rehabs some songs but not all. This album is a 4 out of 10. Let Zakk write next time!!!!"
2,I finally put my finger on what was wrong...,"I finally put my finger on what was wrong... This CD sounds like it was produced like pop albums, this one even has a sample or two (once unheard of for this type of music). I liken it to a pop CD, not because of the sound (it definately has some heavy riffs, some of them even very good thanks to Zakk), the problem is... everything is too perfect, it sounds processed it sounds like a manufactured product that's passed quality assurance. Metallica's Load re ReLoad have this same quality and I think Metal fans hate it.Other problem is the writting, Ozzy knows how to put togeather a ""good song"", but he's still looking back on his past glory days and that's all he can write about, it's kind of sad. A few reviers have noticed the Beatles inspiration, on this CD it's so in your face that I could have sworn Dreamer was a John Lennon cover, I had to check the credits.Buy if you must."
4,Gets Me Through,"It seems that age doesn't affect Ozzy's limits...he has been the king of heavy rock. This is quite a heavy album but the quality of the songs is quite high. There's many great hard rock songs: ""Junkie"", ""Gets Me Through"", ""Facing Hell"" etc. Two ballads are good ones...""Running Out of Time"" and the single track ""Dreamer"". Ozzy hasn't lost his power he had in ""Ozzmosis"" and ""Blizzard of Ozz"" and other great albums. Ozzy still rocks!Stars: Gets Me Through, Dreamer, Junkie"
4,WELCOME BACK OZZY!!,"We have waited for him in 6 years and now he is back with a stunning new studio-album. What can I say? I am a happy ozz-fan!Down to Earth is the heaviest record since NO MORE TEARS back in 1992. DOWN TO EARTH is a true comeback from the Godfather of Heavy Metal, The true Madman of joy! This album is quite good, but will never be as good as BLIZZARD OF OZZ, Ozzy's first studio album. The style is fresh on this album, but it is slow in length, and you miss fast songs as ""Paranoid"" (Black Sabbath) or other ozzy-songs as ""Miracle Man"". DOWN TO EARTH is not a totally original record but still a fantastic comeback and a good album for old, as well as new fans of Ozzy Osbourne...Buy it, or be frustrated!"
3,Nothing to get excited about.,"After being an Ozzy fan for almost 20 years, is there anything really good about it? Not really. When Ozzy first came out on his own in the early 80's he was hungry for success. He had a really solid band. That is why I can still listen to Blizzard, Diary, or Bark at the moon today. Once he became successful, which he deserved, he wasn't hungry anymore. If you listen to this album you hear maybe three good songs. The rest is just rubbish to fill out the album. Every album for the past 13 years has been like this. Two or three good songs with the rest filling out the album. I do not recommend this album. If you are intrested in Ozzy, buy Blizzard of Oz, Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon. Then go see him in concert, thats where he really kicks butt."
4,"Great cartoon, but beware if you already own the series on dvd","I love this show; I used to watch it all the time as a kid. I still think Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield was by far the best. This is a summary of shows usually(but not always) spotlighting Odie from the series Garfield and Friends.Beware if you already own the tv series on dvd, however. These are taken directly from the series, so you are basically just having the convenience of skipping directly to the garfield cartoon from the US Acres cartoons and the shorts.I'm a fan and the price was still nice for me to own this summary dvd and the tiny beanie baby odie, but stay away otherwise."

1,A Relentlessly Grim Waste of Time,"The characters are either victims or bullies, and the story is so mercilessly, one-notedly grim that I wanted an anti-depressant after reading it. I actively hoped for the murder of one character, and prayed for the protagonist to grow a spine at some point, but she never did. I kept hearing about Edna O'Brien's humor, and searched for in these pages in vain. I can't share the litany of miseries Caithleen endures without spoiling the story for anyone who might want to read it, but I will settle for saying that I won't be bothering with the rest of the trilogy."
1,No water resistant 30m,"I did buy these watch for my wife.It was good specifications, apearence and price butthese watch is not water resist 30 meters.water is inside it whit rain only."
5,Excellent -- use nothing else,"I used to use cold cream and water, but no more. I will never go back now that I've used Slide-o-mix for the past few years. The two-part system really works -- first put on the silicone-type oil, just a little. Work that in, and then apply the soapy-type stuff and work it in. Then spray with water and voila, your slide moves like butter on a hot griddle! I then use water most of the time until it starts dragging a little again. When that happens, I just put some more of the soapy stuff on it, spray with water, and it's good to go for another couple uses. I totally clean off the whole slide and start over from scratch maybe once a month or so (I only play once or twice a week though).It's expensive, but it should last you many years. I don't think I'll ever run out, since I play only occasionally."
5,The Best,"Every trombone player should either use this, or the new Yamaha single bottle copycat. Creams are messy and manufacturer brands that come with new horns are a joke. I've been using this stuff for years and it's great, just remember to put it on fresh every month, or every week if you're playing every day. It doesn't last forever on your slide, after all."
1,You get what you pay for,"This seems like a great deal. For $10 bucks more than the apple dock (standalone) you get a dock with ac adapter, a 3.5 mm to 3 RCA cable, an S video cable, a travel charger for the ipod (separate from the dock power supply), a remote, and a dock connector to 3 RCA cable (not dock connector to 2 RCA audio as advertised). Buying these components separately from quality manufacturers would cost over $100. The problem is that Cables to Go is not a quality manufacturer. The dock produced an audible hiss and reversed the audio signal, so that that the left speaker played what the right speaker was supposed to play and vice versa. Further, the remote was extremely shoddy, requiring multiple button presses and extremely accurate aiming even at a distance of 12 feet. I did not use any of the cables, but if they are anything like the dock I'd avoid them."
1,"Scanned pages, not cuztomizable text","As the book is made of scanned text you can not modify back color, font size or rotate screen. Returned it."
3,The LIttle Prince,"I really wanted a copy of this story for my Kindle Fire, but I am somewhat disappointed with this translation."
3,"The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Translator: Richard Howard. Publisher: Harcourt Children's Books (2000), Hardcov","I bought this as a gift for some friends who had recently had their first child, a son. The first copy arrived promptly from the seller, but some of the pages were blank where there should have been text &/or illustrations. The seller was great about correcting the problem. This is a well-loved classic, but this ""new translation"" is not as lyrical, in English, as the one with which I was raised. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, Harcourt."
3,Compare the new and old translation for yourself,"The review by ""Harbor Bookstore (Friday Harbor, Wa. USA)"" seemed to be getting a bit of grief for downplaying the latest translation. Having never read either the original translation or the French version, I found the opinion worth researching. Here is a website from Harcourt that compares the two English language editions side by side, for those like me, who are curious to the differences: http://www.harcourtbooks.com/LittlePrince/compare.aspI'd have to agree that the Katherine Woods version seems to carry a bit more charm. Richard Howard seems to have made a translation to the exact standards of proper grammer. While that may be a faithful translation of the French words, I could understand the arguement that his translation lacks the poetry from those words.Decide for yourself."
3,Not as good as it should be,It took my husband and me quite effort to take the book out from its cover. It would have been better without the cover. I would have bought the one without the gift cover - nice and cheaper.
4,REVIEW: HOAX -VOICES AFAR 1988-1989,"A fairly good compilation of the Hoax's early material. There are certainly moments that make you cringe - poor recordings, raw and some silly songs. But, there are some great moments that remind you of the power and talent of this hungry band. Baby is a standout tune that is Beattlesque and showcases Garay's vision for the band. As a matter of fact there are a lot of classic Garay tunes included here such as you're a Liar and the rare What would you say? There is also a great powerhouse remake of AC DC's tune Ride On. There is some hint at their more progressive future on tunes such as Pulpo and experimental Hulings/Broaddus tunes. It is also nice to hear the humor that was a big part of their earlier days."
3,ok..but a little boring,"I thought we would enjoy the lullabies on this CD, but once we got the CD and listened to the songs, we felt they were a little boring."
4,Soothing,We have thoroughly enjoyed the Disney Baby Lullaby cd. Our son seems to be soothed by it and it brings back many fond memories of disney movies we watched as young children. We are very happy with the cd.
4,Puts baby to sleep,"At first i didn't really like this cd. they take well-known songs and over-synthesize them. i also think it is pricey compared to some of the other options (i guess that's what you pay for having 'disney' on the label). HOWEVER, this CD is the BEST when baby is wired and won't go to sleep. i have NEVER seen her stay awake through the third song. so, it's my miracle cd and i wouldn't trade it for anything."
2,Wasn't so happy,"I got this CD as a gift. I listen to the song along with my daughter, but she didn't seem to respond to it. the song was so well words can not explain. I bought a fisher Price CD call little people a sind along song and she love that compare to this one."
4,On the verge,"Helio Sequence is on the verge of becoming one of the underground's best sounds. Drawing elements from shoegazer bands like Rollerskate Skinny to Spiritualized-ish space rock, Helio Sequence have sort of a dark demeanor and attitude to them as well. Lyrics such as ""We're not part of your little scene/ because we don't read your magazine"" and ""shut your face/know your place/go to school/get a job"" give you the sense that guys are not your everyday ordinary kids and have a chip on their shoulder about it. That's what I like. Maybe you could say they are like a more spacey version of Six By Seven. Square Bubbles and Nothing's OK are very excellent tracks. If they can could craft a bit more melody or hooks in their instrumental parts on a mre consistent basis, Helio Sequence could possibly be on the verge of making maybe the greatest album ever. For now, they are ""just"" damn good. Their 1st album Com-plex is worth checking out as well."
2,16-layer dip too filling,"I saw these guys at SxSW and was amazed at the amount of sound and energy they were able to generate for just two guys. I was impressed enough to pick up a copy of the CD at the show based largely on the song 'Cut the Camera' which is also the best song on the CD. Unfortunately, many of the songs get lost in a wash of synth-loops and other effects in a man v. machine struggle for control. The potential is certainly there once they gain enough confidence in their vocals and songwriting to let the songs and melodies breath a little more. Will they be given a chance?"
4,Brisband Underground Classic,"Six-track debut CD from now-defunct Brisbane thrash band Mi'dget, released at the height of their powers in 1994. Combines the angular guitar attack of Slint with vocals akin to Lemmy of Motorhead. Opening track ""Breeding Ground"" is worth the purchase price alone for its crunching, bottom heavy dirge: they don't write 'em like this anymore. Fans of June of '44, Palace, and other ""post-rock"" outfits will be pleasantly surprised by this undiscovered gem."
5,Review of A History of the Jews in the Modern World by Howard M. Sachar,"A History of the Jews in the Modern World provides a more comprehensive view of Jewish History post 14th century than other histories I've read in the past. My book club is studying Jewish History, focusing initially on the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century, also looking at European Jewish immigration to the United States, and has agreed to study Sachar's book."
1,Bad Product,I had this product less than a year. When I first installed it the Windows XP had trouble in recognizing it. Finally it did after spending some time trying to find a proper driver. I used this card mainly to connect and external drive to an old Pentium III that had only 1.1 USB connections. At first did not see the drive. found out that the drive needed to be connected long time (4 or more hours) until I could get accessibility through this USB connection. While connected it worked well. Finally 3 weeks ago the card stopped working completely and I need to replace it. Do not bother purchasing it. It is a piece of junk.
4,IT'S PERFECT!!!!,"I bought the CD because I love their version of Happy Birthday! It reminds me of my childhood. So glad that I finally have it on a CD. Its a tad expensive, but glad I was able to find it."
3,I'm pissed......,"Heh heh, just my luck.... no Bury Your Dead..... I was actually at this show in Mansfield, and due to a miscalculation in tolerance of a certain female friend i brought, i spent the whole Bury Your Dead set trying to cool her off and making sure she was conscious. I really wanted to see them.... BUT MORE THAN THAT! They put a duet of Flyleaf and Richard Patrick on this DVD, and not Korn doing Wicked with Chino from the Deftones?!?!? WTF? Otherwise a pretty good buy :)"
1,It doesnt matter that one Korn song is a little different.,Deadsy gets ONE song and Flyleaf gets THREE???? Wow. maybe if the DVD had a better arrangement I would consider buying it.
3,A nice scope for a kid gun,"Put this on my kids 10/22 and love it. It can take a little work to get the turrets changed and properly adjusted, hence the three stars, but a good overall scope for what I believe to be a very fair price. I would not hesitate to buy this scope again. However, if you have the disposable income for the newer model, with the single turret, I would go that way."
5,Sweet. Scope.,"Install was a breeze, cost was about 1/3 less than in store locally, and sighting in was easy (I've never sighted in a scope before). It didn't come with mounting rings, I picked those up at Wally World for a few bucks.The screw-in dust covers are a little tedious, would have been much easier to have plastic slip-on covers."
5,scope satisfaction,"When scopes sell from 20 dollars to 5000 dollars & more...your personal selection criteria is critical. Balancing cost, quality and functional fit can be difficult. This scope while on inexpensive end, still gives adequate function and enjoyment in the target shooting arena. Would I have liked to have a brighter, light gathering scope ? ...yes, but at this price & I can afford to have four scopes on my four guns & literally have a blast without getting another mortgage!"
1,Godspeak,"This book mentions God, Jesus, Christ, or quotes Scripture multiple times in each chapter. I freely acknowledge that some people might find this helpful, but I did not. Written for depressed Holy Rollers. Skip it if you don't fit that description."
1,when all is said and done,"Podhoretz is just a thug! He justifies the comment of a Viennese anti-Semite one hundred years ago, Hermann Bialohlawek: scholarship is what one Jews steals from another!"
2,"Good, but misleading","When I ordered this book I thought I was getting the walking bass lines to perform classic tunes. Unfortunately, this book only contains the melodies written in bass clef and the solos. It does not contain what I bought it for; the walking bass lines that outline the chords. The misleading review by so-called ""author and professor"" Carl Franklin states that ""This book is good for learning the traditional bass lines and for practicing your timing/tempo when there's no one else around."" Mr Franklin, I don't know what book you ordered but its not this one. Again, NO WALKING BASS LINES HERE."
2,"It worked, it broke, its not being replaced.","This is an example of what you pay for, is what you get.In less than a month this thing fell apart and no longer worked. I was somewhat impressed by it when I got it, because it did the job flawlessly! I suggest going for a headset though or something that wont slide out of your ear."
3,Good nostalgia,"Great book that is nostalgic for me, but I must say the picture books I am reading to my son now are way better. This is a total yawn-pie for him after more modern stories."
2,shipper problem.. not the stand quality itself,"i received the tv stand from CCV quickly. it was damaged when i inspected the parts. the wood surface was scratched and dented. i contacted CCV and they said they would only refund the 70 some dollars that it cost and would not refund the shipping of around $200!!!! they said that damage ""could have happened during shipping"" so i would need to take up that charge with fedex. this company is based in MASS and it was shipped to TX. for that price in shipping, CCV should have ensured quality care in shipping OR they are grossly inflating the shipping cost and passing it onto the customer. i think the techcraft stand is nice. it seems strong and not cheap or junky at all. but the handling of the item: either by CCV at there store or the poor standard CCV requested from fedex for $200 seems highly questionable. if you order this product i recommend not using this company for your order. there are currently about 4 other businesses offering the same item."
1,High School Romance,"I too agree with the previous reviewer that Lili's age was a negative factor in the story. She is only 17 and everyone, from the Viscount, in-laws and family count her as being too young to even take in the season. She was also raised in a convent then on a farm so she would thereby be more sheltered than even the other 17 year old young girls. She was a very young 17. It might have made more sense for Ms. Hazard to yes, take Lili from the Moorland farm and live with Cornelia and Alastair but still wait until she was of age to do the Season. Romance between the the 28 year old Viscount and the 17 year old convent breed young girl did not fly with this reader, even given the time period."
5,Practical Applications for Biblical Leadership Teachings,"This incredible book is motivational, educational, and literally a manual for developing, refining and/or improving your leadership abilities. It's a quick read and the principles are applicable for anyone: no matter their career or walk of life. The author weaves a perfect balance between Biblical teachings/principles, modern examples and applications. I highly recommend this book for yourself or to give as a gift. I know I refer to it frequently for a quick pick me up, or just to remind me to keep the right focus."
3,"Good, but not great","The stories and recollections by Professor Watkins are priceless and are from a unique perspective. I found the way the book delevoped was a little unusual, but still interesting. The last section of the book (approximately 20 pages) are worthless details to even the above average motor sports fan. I would have likeed to see another story.It would be an enjoyable book for a true F1 fan."
2,Vibration for Healing DVD,Have experienced vibrational healing and it was wonderful. Ordered Vibrations for Healing.Was expecting healing sounds and got several people with very big egos talking about themselves.
5,Profoundly simple and moving film !,"This film deals with a simple concern : the feelings between the human beings . Ozu focuses his poetic eye in the increasingly Americanized postwar Tokyo . His unique style with the fixed camera at the kneel height is wonderful but it turns excessively steady and can result unbearable .Nevertheless he created a vivid and poignant portrait about a father giving up his only daughter in marriage . Haunting , humorous and disturbing . This was the Op. 53 and the last one film of this giant japanese film maker."
4,Christy,"All though I was thrilled to see this wonderful series FINALLY out on DVD I was a little disappointed that there wasn't even ONE extra on it for what was being charged for it. Even the video sets had a documentary of the making of the series on it. Nevertheless, like I said, I'm thrilled that it's finally out on DVD and highly recommend it."
3,Christy,"First off - go buy this dvd from Wal-Mart. It is only $20 there. Second off, I have waited FOREVER for this to come out on dvd. I'm thrilled that I now own it, but it doesn't seem to be the quality of of dvd that it could be. There are no extras whatsever. The menu screen doesn't even play music or anything. They just posted a picture up there and figured that would be enough. I see so much more that they could have done with this. The box itself seems to be cheaply made. It is kind of disappointing.This is still my favorite series ever, and was so beautifully filmed w/ a great cast. I wish they could have done a reunion show or something. I just finished rewatching all the series, and I was once again heartbroken at the end when they just end the series with her standing between Dr. McNiell (whom I'd choose - sexy accent!), and David Grantland. I just knew it'd have a different ending this time even though I knew exactly what was coming."
5,Christy is my hero,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series and would love it if they make more. I just wanted to see more of this. I visit Cades Cove At least once a year more if I can. I go in by Townsand when I go. I would like to know if they made any more to this series.
1,Not for an M505,"I had heard this was the best cases on the market when they came out and were originally designed for the Palm V. However, while the new cases say they fit the M505, mine did not. The rail was too skinny and my Palm M505 slid right off the rail and onto the floor--thank goodness it was carpeted! They supply plastic adjusters to slide onto the rail so it can fit the Palm V, but my husband tried his on it and it slid off too. Most other reviewers just put a piece of tape on the end so that it will provide a catch to hold it on the rail--but, I don't like having to pay so much for a case and having to provide my own tacky fixes! I tried the case on an M500 and it fit good, but not it does not fit for the M505."
1,What is this piece of plastic?,"Urgh, I had high hopes but ended up returning this piece of plastic that looked like something someone tossed out on the side of the street. It didn't work at all, the needle was stuck to the base and wouldn't move. What a disappointing purchase."
5,Her story,"Not all history is cannons and muskets. In truth most history is not. And in many parts really quite boring. But everything has its place. Like the great bard said, The world is a stage and we are all but actors upon it.And this film based on the research and reading of one woman's diary is really quite interesting.It is the story of a midwife. It begins after the American revolution and through it we travel through time to her world to visit. We meet her husband. We meet some of her offspring. But best of all we meet her world.Nicely re-enacted. Nicely done. Well researched. A must for anyone interested in the time period."
3,Peculiar vintage movie.,This movie could become a cult classic in a dadaist way. Aside from an occasional flash of skin the vampire lady is not exactly nude. The acting and direction is profoundly awkward and one would expect to see the motion jerky as in a keystone cops movie. The plot is staggeringly unbelievable.
4,"Great, but be gentle.","I'm not sure every good product deserves the absolutely perfect rating. That being said, these modular inserts are great. They really make your multimedia area look clean and professional. You typically don't unplug and reinsert cables after you get things set up so they should be durable enough and they're extremely versitale. I've used these for all kinds of connections: ethernet, a/v interconects, speaker wire, etc., and never broken one. I wouldn't exactly go yanking on anything plugged in, but if you're up for running cables through walls and such, I suspect you're not the kind of person who is abusive of your work anyway."
4,Great toy bad shipping,This toy is just as pictured. The little penguin is attached but can easily be undone. They are both very soft and cuddly. My only issue is that I needed it by a specific day. I ordered it on a Friday (in the early morning) and it shipped on Saturday with 2-day shipping. I did not recieve it until Thursday seven days after I ordered it. I needed it on Wednesday and the kid has to wait until I am able to visit them again to get it for his birthday; to bad I live 3 hours away.
5,Loved it,Our penguin obsessed granddaughter immediately took to the pair. The baby is cute and the Mama is very soft and huggable
4,nice but small,"Very nice soft fabric, but its smaller then expected.. still adorable and good for the price. I recommend buying.the baby penguin is nice also, i would recommend for any age"
2,Comfortable but cover is NOT reversible!,"It is comfy, not too mushy. Please note that the description is quite misleanding: ""a soft microsuede cover reversing to twill"" I think implies that the cover is reversible - meaning it can be removed and turned inside out (to reverse it). What they mean is that the unremoveable cover consists of one half twill and one half microsuede. So don't count on washing the cover apart from it's fat, fluffy companion. If the description were more accurate, I wouldn't have bought this product. Caveat Emptor."
1,No stars for this book,"If this is how you'd like your child to find out there is no such thing as Santa Claus, if you'd like to teach your child that it is ok to laugh at other kids for what they believe in, if referring to other kids as ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" is how you'd like them to treat people, then this book is for you. For me, I was appalled at the escalating references to there not being a Santa Claus. I was hoping as the book progressed that tone would change but it didn't. After reading a couple of chapters with my daughter I fast forworded to the end for the shocking conclusion. Needless to say, the book disappeared from her bookshelf without being finished. Shame on Judy Delton and the publisher. Now I have an eight year old daughter questioning Christmas and Santa Clause. A children's Christmas book should not be the way your child finds out there is no Santa Claus. This book should have been titled a ""Pee Wee Christmas Dream Killer."" At least we'd have some forwarning."
3,Written very well; some content questionable,A Pee Wee Christmas by Judy Delton is written very well and is very interesting to children. It comes from a great series of books for children.This book is not appropriate for children who still believe in Santa Claus. It brings up the question of if there really is a Santa Claus. A boy who still believes gets laughed at.It is very appropriate for older children.
2,Incompatible with newer quicktime versions,"This title is out of date, and installing it will break other applications that rely on newer versions of Quicktime.It requires Quicktime, but the program installer doesn't recognized the most recent versions of Quicktime, so it won't start. Instead, it recommends that you uninstall your ""old"" version and install its ""new"" version, which is actually many years old.I would not recommend installing this software if you have any need for any other application or web page that relies on Quicktime."
3,Georgia Mom,"This product is so-so. My five year old daughter laughs at Jessie's math maze(even though it does not challenge her). She did learn the basic concept of multiplication by using this program. Overall, she is already bored with it after just a few hours of play."
1,Failed in 1-2 years,Got this drive 1-2 years ago for a Dell 1720 and under normal internet surfing and normal daily used and it failed inabout within 2 years.
2,Not so hot...,"Lasted less than a year, but at least they make better drives now. But thats life, you win some and you loose some..."
4,Nice Harddrive,"I bought this unit to install in a ULTRA Enclosure.This unit is a Serial ATA. The PC board plugs directlyinto a socket.This is not the Parallel ATA/EIDE, Which has two rows of 40 ormore pins.Any way, I use it for for Backup and Storage with aLaptop PC. WORKS FINE"
4,What a mystery,"I thought the book was great. It was full of mystery. I never would have guessed that it was Pit Snyder all along that really killed Jed. I thought from the beginning it was Jenny, just cause of what she thought after they left the hospital. Claire's life is also quite interesting. I'm happy that in then end she was able to help Jenny out. I would definitely recommend reading the rest of the Claire Watkins mystery books."
4,Great character work,"Leslee Becker was my professor at Colorado State where I studied creative writing. Her writing is poignant, witty, and often touching. She has a knack for bringing characters to life in her teachings as well as her own writings. I hope others have the pleasure of reading this as well as learning from her at CSU."
4,FORETELLS WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY,This book is almost spooky in the way that it seems to foretell the future. I had to keep checking when it was written. It makes it easy to see why this president has self-destructed.
4,Dillinger . . .in detail!,"Very well written, meticulous in detail. This is one of the best accounts of one of the most notorious American criminals of all time. Gives the background, events and experiences that shaped this contradictory personality into the hardened criminal that he eventually became.Definitely a book to read even if you know much about this period in American history."
3,Document that changed the world so much,"It may not be easy to fully understand the rationale behind what has origially driven Karl Max to write ""Das Kapital"", but this very document has surely created the Cold War that divided the world so deeply and so painfully. It caused so many lives, so much miserable living conditions to so million people around the world.So far, there's maybe no other document in the world history that killed so many people with the same grave impact as Das Kapital.Volak SaoPhnom Penh"
1,Horrible edition,"The Gateway Edition of Capital is a great example right-wing capitalist economists distorting Marx for their own purposes. The introduction has a pro-capitalist bias, and substantial portions of the work have been cut out from this edition.If you want to read Capital, Volume I, get the Penguin or Vintage edition, which is unabridged and has extensive footnotes."
5,Comment on Kaleidoscope,"Having read 'The Claivoyant Countess', I was eager for more. The delight of finding 'Kaleidoscope' was a follow on was not disappointed by the story. I loved it. I wonder if there is any hope of a third?A really good read.Amazon verified purchase"
4,Another great Madame Karitska book...,"I have long awaited the next book about Madame Karitska. Although this book is not as in-depth into the Spiritual world and psychic powers as The Clairvoyant Countess, it still rates a four.The book introduces many new and interesting characters that could possibly lead into several more books, hopefully, in the series.Please write another very soon, Ms. Gilman - your fans anxiously await the next Madame Karitska novel."
5,"Excellent, Highly Subtle Book.","This is an excellent, highly subtle book. It is interesting and persuasive on the American pragmatists, there are especially interesting comments on Dewey and Peirce, who are new to me, but equally perceptive judgments and assessments of such major thinkers as Roberto Unger and Michel Foucault.As with anything written by Professor West, the vibes in the prose are powerful and mixed: the rythms of jazz and subtle tones of Harvard-accented English (yes, there is such a thing!), blend smoothly with more familiar idioms to render the scholarly assessments, at least for me, MORE and NOT LESS vital and organic.The passion for empowered democracy comes through here, as it always does with West, and so does the Christian sentiment. I would say that there is in this excellent book a bit of the Christian Romanticism that Professor West attributes to Unger.Fine book, let us hope for more from Professor West."
1,"Nice try, if you're an undergraduate","Nothing I could say about this book would be as compelling as reading an excerpt from it. Any excerpt. The writing lumbers with precisely that kind of late adolescent turgidity and overweaning insistence that makes reading undergraduate papers so unbearable; the argument is nothing more than a series of unsupported and simple-minded generalities; the depth of scholarship reaches about as far as the water in a children's wading pool. The only thing this forgettable little book establishes is that Cornel West knows as little about pragmatism as he does about effective writing. But as I said, don't take my word for it. Read the excerpt and see for yourself."
1,I CANT BELIEVE I USED TO LIKE THESE BACK IN 2003,Dont buy off these crap pillocks! I know this review is short but its repeating my review of their 1st album what I would have put down!R.J from BritainP.S Sorry the rap community for once liking these! And anyway its time to celebrate! Todays my 1st anniversary of listening to rap thanks to The Black Eyed Peas and D12 and now I'm pure Hip Hop so thanks go out to The Black Eyed Peas and D12!!
3,I never had tutors like these!,"Definately NOT a wholesome anime, but they are getting a whole lot of something. Two young men are hired as ""tutors"" for a veritable harem of young, rich, bored, young women. What do they get to teach? An advance course in social interaction is what they're teaching, while solving the mystery of the ""House of Forbidden Fruit."" Good art and animation.....great subtitles!"
3,Good for a gift,"It was ok. Most of the ideas are good, some are quite confusing because the book uses a lot of big words, while some were impractical and hard. It's a good gift for someone not really close to you I guess. I guess it's just something nice to read when you want to kill some time."
3,Not for my gun - returned,This grip may be fine for a Baby Desert Eagle .40SW ..... but does not fit the Baby Desert Eagle II .40SW - I returned the item My fault - I didn't pay attention to the picture that shows a screw hole on the grip - the new Baby Desert Eagle II polymer frame .... is one piece grip - no screws ....
5,"Man, I just love this CD",It's so lush and rhythmic. Makes nice background music for the soundtrack of your day to day life.
4,great bottle,"I really like this bottle. The pink is so cute and I love the easy accessibility of the sports cap. There are two things, however that gets kind of annoying: 1) is the black ring that it comes with-- every time you screw off the top that comes off too; and 2) whenever I drink (particularly from a relatively full bottle) the mouthpiece makes an audible squeaky guzzling sound which can be embarrassing in quiet settings."
5,Great Water Bottle,Just purchased RO water system. Had 2 goals: drink large amounts of good water at work and not use plastic bottles (PABA / platic). This water bottle met both needs. Holds large amount of water and great caphighly recommended.
2,damaged,"Although it was advertised as new, the bottle came damaged. It had multiple dents in the base of the bottle."
2,Made in China,"For those that care where their products are manufactured, this item is made in China and comes standard with a plastic cap not a stainless steel cap as others have noted."
4,not plastic,The product is great. Only one improvement: Can you make the top a flip top instead of a screw top.
2,Poor Packaging -- Arrived Damaged,Bought two of these. Amazon packaged them together with a thin sheet of plastic separating them. Paint was scuffed on both bottles.
4,Poly Flat Caps Leak Internally,"The bottles are great, and instructions DO say not to put the Poly Caps in the dishwasher because water may ""squeeze in."" But we've never done that.Our two both ""took in"" water just from being hand washed with regular dishes. Now we've got sudsy gray-water bouncing around inside the caps - and probably drippin' into my Green Tea.They SHOULD warn you not to submerse the caps AT ALL! And why aren't they leakproof?Anyway, we'll hafta give Klean Kanteen a call to see what kind of hoops they want us to jump through to get the things replaced."
1,Nasty label adhesive contaminates bottle,"I ordered these expensive stainless steel bottles as a healthy alternative to plastic bottles and their leaching chemicals, especially for my kindergartener to use at school (where they normally use the same plastic water bottle for 4-5 months at a stretch). I was VERY disappointed when the bottles arrived with a label INSIDE the sports cap top (reading ""Made in China"" no less) that three weeks later, I still haven't been able to completely remove. The label is stuck on with such a strong, nasty adhesive that it remains there after many, many soakings in all kinds of concoctions of soap, vinegar, detergent, etc. So whatever this nasty adhesive is (from China), it is contaminating the water inside the bottle, thus defeating one of the main purposes of purchasing these expensive bottles. When I complained to the seller, they only offered a refund, not a replacement of the cap without a label stuck inside. Very disappointing."
2,Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottle,This stainless steel water bottle tastes like metal and it also seems to leak a bit. I am not happy with it and could not recommend it to anyone else. There was a plastic plug which made a horrible sound when I drank. I cut the plug out and the sound is gone but it leaks so I probably should not have done that. However there were no instructions on this. I would not buy this product again nor anything from this particular company.
3,Top leaks,"I have the smaller version and never had a problem w/ leaks, but w/ this one, even w/ the sippy part pushed down and the cap on, it still leaks.Also, it's worth buying the overpriced neophrene holder, since if you drop the bottle it'll ding/dent."
3,"I like it, but it is made in China",The bottle works well. The cap securely fits without issue. I didn't realize that it was made in China until I looked under the cap though. I like the cap because you can hook it onto a stroller and not have to carry it.
4,Functions perfectly but color chips away,"This water bottle functions exactly as it should. I use mine nearly every day and I've had it for about a year. Unfortunately, it's not as pretty as it was when I first got it...the color is slowly chipping away. I had a feeling that would happen when I purchased it but none of the reviews mentioned it."
4,Great product. Convenient and environmentally friendly.,"I like how lightweight and easy to clean this is. Water tastes just fine, not metallic at all, actually tastes better than it does in plastic. Good buy,"
2,Yuck!!! Awful metallic taste to the water!!,"I used to use SIGG bottle but when I saw that inner lining started peel off around the bottle lip and realized that I may have been ingesting some parts of it, I had to find something else fast.I so wanted to like this bottle but I HATE, HATE, HATE how this bottle makes water taste like you are sucking on a penny or something awful. If you let the water sit in this bottle more than a hour or so, the water turns to disgustingly metallic tasting so much so that I have to keep throwing out the water and find other water. Yuk!! I also don't like the huge opening. Everytime I try to drink out of it, the water dribble down on to my chin and neck. Forget trying to drink from it when you are on the moving train or car :("
3,"Cold, clean water, but noisy!","This product kept the water cold & clean-tasting, but it was very noisy when you drank the water."
2,Dripping Wet,The description was very unclear. It is not insulated ans it sweats and does not keep anything cold or hot. Even the order was incorrect after discussing with and placing it with the company.
4,Paint chips.,"Love the item, but the paint chipped in one area within a week of receiving this gift. It hasn't spread, and I really don't care as long as my drink stays in the bottle when it is sealed."
4,It's Good...wished it were bigger!,i really do like my klean kanteen 12-oz bottle. like a dope...i didn't realize that i probably needed a larger one...but it's a great buy for this price and is great for the environment...GO GREEN!
3,Great but fragile,"I dropped my Klean Kanteen on a cement floor the first day I got it, and it bent the bottom. So now I have leaning Klean Kanteen. It keeps water cool, but I wish it were a little sturdier."
3,"gotta be honest, doesnt seem worth the price...","its a simple metal bottle. yes its bpa free, etc. i appreciate all that.but still, its just a bottle.some issues:1. i expected this to sweat, based on the other reviews, but i noticed it gets really really cold on the outside too. so much so that its something difficult to hold the bottle while you drink from it. i expected there would be some barrier to at least not have that happen.2. sports cap makes a weird high pitched noise when you drink. i thought it was just me, but it turns out other people have reported this too.3. color bottles should NOT be put in the dish washer. i.e. the color will come off. so color ones ARE NOT dishwasher safe. please know this before you buy. i missed this, maybe its noted on the website description...all in all, ill keep the bottle. ill try to find a sleeve or something so that i can drink from it easier..."
2,mold growing inside,"You can't see mold growing inside, until you look in it. Even then, it is dark in there without proper lighting. I couldn't believe I saw a decent amount of brown/black mold inside. Thought I would really love this bottle. Sadly a waste of money & I bought all the caps too. I now use a plastic see-through bottle FREE after buying health supplements. And so far that is not growing mold at all. Dunno how Klean Kanteen has all those good reviews. I should use it as a vase!"
3,Not very happy with it.,"I was looking for a bottle that didn't make my water taste like plastic. I purchased this one online but i was not very happy with it.This bottle does not smell like plastic, but it smells like metal. Every time I would take a drink I would smell and taste metal.I do like the wide mouth opening to allow you to add ice. It also seems strong and durable and I like that it's dishwasher safe. However I can't get over the taste and smell of metal, so overall this was not a great purchase."
4,Wonderful Water bottles,"The Klean Kanteens are a wonderful substitute for plastic water bottles. I do use them for my children's sippy cups and I will say that they dent when dropped and the adapter (separate purchase) for the ""sippy"" parts cracks under the not so careful use of a 13 month old, but the ones my husband and I use still look like new. I have a cabinet full of them and will buy more! Also, it may seem silly, but I love the colors available!"
5,Love Klean Kanteen,"As always, these bottles live up to my expectations. As many people have indicated, the top isn't leak-proof. But if you close it tightly and keep it mostly upright, this isn't really an issue."
2,Leaky top,"Really liked the design and size of this bottle and ordered 2, one for my husband and one for me. Unfortunately I can't recommend to buy this bottle as both tops leak. This is really bad when you want to pack them for a day trip and everything around it gets soaked! Too bad!"
4,sports cap,"Good Product, only complaint is the cap, which isn't as tight as it could be. Such a quality product should not be defined by the inadequacy of an accessory."
2,Mystery Metals from where???,"All stainless steel types are NOT OK for use in potabable water systems or for potable water storeage. Stainless steel comes in many formulations and some have heavy metals that are toxic which can be leached out under diminshed pH.It is my guess that these are made in China with NEXT TO NO CONTROL on formulation of the SS material and can easily contain toxic metals not suitable for potable water. Once you put your mouth on one of these you can have a drop in pH from bacterial transfered to the container within a days time from souring due to bacteria bloom.Avoid use of SS products that do not have an ASTM grade of 304 or 316 or at least ask a lot of questions. Just because it does not rust does not mean it can not impart seriously toxic heavy metals into your product, particularly if its wine, soured water, or something mildly acidic.Neat gadgets are cool, but getting your brain poisened from pitting of molybdenum? Now how cool is that really?"
2,It doesn't do the job for me,"This product just didn't do the job for me. I didn't return it, but I probably should have because I'll probably just send it to Goodwill."
3,Metally smell,"I purchased three of these kanteens, one for each of my family members. Unfortunately, I had washed the kanteens already, before finding out that as you drink from it, the canister emits a metally smell--which makes it seem like you're drinking metal as well. Three weeks after using this product, the metal smell is still there, although not as strong. I'm hoping this smell will go away soon. As for the taste of water, the water definitely tastes better than the plastic bottle. Maybe all I have to do is to hold my breath before attempting to drink."
5,Excellent water bottle!,"This is a fantastic water bottle. You can put just about anything in it and the container will not absorb any funky flavors or odors. It's safe to wash in the dishwasher and it's held up pretty well after a couple of accidental drops, too."
4,Sports bottle,"I love this kanteen. I feel virtuous because I'm not using plastic, the water tastes great, and it fits in my car drink holder. The only drawback is that when you drink, it makes this strange, rather loud sound. It doesn't matter when working out (can't hear over the music) but when I just bring along it can be a little strange."
5,"No worries about leaching chemicals, very durable","It's durable, doesn't leave any aftertaste to the water, cap is actually a very water-tight seal! Nalgenes may or may not leach bisphenol-A, but the Nalgene manufacturer recommends not filling with hot liquids, cleaning with soaps/detergents, and/or scrubbing with a brush... just in case. Not entirely clear to me how I'm supposed to keep my Nalgene clean with all those restrictions!The Sigg water bottle (aluminum) is apparently lined with a proprietary plastic-based liner, which kinda defeats the purpose of moving away from a Nalgene/plastic bottle. Sounds like Klean Kanteen is the way to go. I can even fill it with hot chocolate (just use a neoprene-type sleeve for insulation) and rinse it out later with really hot water for cleaning. (Plus now I *really* don't need to worry about cracking this bottle!)"
4,No after taste,No metal or plastic after taste whatsoever. How you put the water in is how it comes out. (I do use mine with a stainless cap as well) I lost my bottle with water in it for a week and when I found it I decided to try the water to see how it tasted - tasted great! Compare that to the Nalgene that I used for years - after about 2 hours the water tasted so much like plastic that I had to refill it with fresh water - or worse I was in the wilderness and had to drink it... Mmmmm gotta love plastic BPA flavor! As for the Sigg bottles - aluminum is terrible for you like BPA - sure they have a painted liner inside - but are you going to trust that the company says their secret formula painted liner is completely safe? Stick with stainless steel or recycle a glass Sobe bottle for your water...
4,Gotta Break it in,"At first it seemed to flavor the water, but after a few dish washes it went away. The 40-oz is bigger than most cup holders, doesn't fit in anything at the gym. Also I recommend ordering the 5$ sport cap with it. The loop cap that it comes with is a pain in the arse. After you get past the cons its a decent water bottle, lasts me an entire day at work so I can get away w/o paying CRV. :)"
4,Nice item,"I ordered two of these bottles, one for me and one for my husband. We both liked them, however at first my husband thought it tasted metallic. We have had the canteen for about a month now, and he says he no longer tastes it. Overall, we are very happy with our purchase."
1,"Must keep upright, Cap 2.0 leaks our pours out when closed, as packaging says after arrival.","This cap 2.0 pours water out when upside down. It does not hold water at all due to the air bypass design to allow quick drinking/air replacement. The packaging on arrival notes this. I did not see that disclaimer on Amazon. Cap 2.0 is a rip off and is good for only uses cases when the bottle is always upright.Bottle quality is good, get different cap or competing provider. I think it is a scam/business decision to get people to by the better lids which are an extra ~$10 sold separately, after the get this poor designed cap. Get stainless cap or the Cap 3.0 might be better."
5,Very Happy,I love this product the 27OZ fits perfectly in the side of my backpack and keeps my water cold all day. It does sweat a bit when you first put water in but that is the only downside to this product. I have been using it everyday for a week....would defiently buy another when/if needed.
3,No Landfill Here - or BPA!,"It is nice to drink from a container that does not pose a health threat (that we know of). It's easy to fill not only with a beverage, but ice goes in easily. The bottle fits in cup holders in vehicles without a problem.Here's the one drawback: IT SWEATS badly. Without any kind of insulation, the canteen naturally sweats, especially during warm, humid days. I put a couple of old foam can coolers on it (remove the bottom of one and slip it toward the top) and that really helped. Problem here; it doesn't fit in the cup holder of the car. I believe they make an insulated cover but I have not yet looked closely at them.In addition, with a ""recycled"" plastic soda bottle, you don't have to worry about losing it and costing you a small fortune."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I received the bottles in good condition but when I used one of them, it ""chirped"" when I drank from it. It was very distracting to everyone around me. I haven't used the bottles again. The stainless steel bottle is fine. It is just the lid makes the chirping noise."
5,love this bottle,"I was looking for something that would be healthy after hearing about all the nasty stuff in the plastic bottles. this one is Great and a good size for me. only problem is ""sweating"". I also got the sport top for it making it easier to use."
1,Not any better than a plastic container,"I thought after reading the reviews that water would stay cool even in a car. However, that's not the case. The metal container actually is quite hot to hold after a few hours. I was disappointed."
2,I would buy plastic...,This bottle is functional and a nice design but I can not get over the metal taste. I should have bought a Nalgene or another plastic bottle.
4,easy to clean,"Wide mouth, which is hard to find. Very sturdy, seems undentable but light-weight and no worry about plastic contaminants and you can clean with bleach of boiling water if necessary."
1,"I want a ""safe"" bottle, not one made in China","With all the recent coverage on how China does not regard our safety in the least, I find it incredible that a product designed to keep us away from plastics and ""safe"" is made in China.I'm getting a SIGG bottle. I will not support a country that could care less if my family is safe or not!"
1,Loop cap leaks.,"One of the most important features of a water bottle should be that it does not leak. That is not the case with the Klean Kanteen 18 oz classic with loop cap. Very disappointed, will not purchase or recommend."
2,Do NOT keep liquids cold,"These water bottles are sturdy and very nice looking, but they do not keep liquids cold. Also, younger children may not fully close the sport cap top, so liquids will leak. I bought two 18-ounce bottles for my 4-year old twins. The bottles are fine for use around the house, but they do not keep water cold for more than 30 minutes. I have not been able to use these bottles for sports games, which was the only reason I bought them."
1,Kanteen cap,I really like the Klean Kanteen however I purchased the litte black cap the twist on one.The cap has already broken wouldn't recommend this cap.
3,Great bottle poor customer service,"We have 5 Kleen Kanteen bottles. All have the Sport Cap 2.0 which Amazon notified us about a recall. The recall notice states the top can break off and create a choking hazard, however KK is replacing it. Since you have to return the cap in order to get a new one, they promised a quick turn around for the problem. Three weeks ago and counting, we started the process. We are still waiting for our new caps. Meanwhile we cannot use our bottles. Calls to Kleen Kanteen go into voice mail and are not returned. Very disappointing."
4,quality,"the quality of the bottle is not as good as the first one I bought several years ago, but I'm still happy about getting it. The 8-ounce one is just right for my 7-year-old, but I really don't like the loop cap. Take up space in her lunch box."
2,"Nice bottle, but sweats all over the place, dents easily","I thought this bottle was great when I first got it because it was stainless steel. However, the steel isn't all that thick and my kids drop it a lot and it dents all the time. We've even had to take a hammer to the bottom a few times just so it can stand up straight. It also sweats all over the table when you put anything cold on it and makes a big mess. I have since ordered the Thermos Nissan insulated steel bottle for myself but my hubby and sons are still using these since we bought themThermos Nissan 18-Ounce Stainless-Steel Hydration Bottle. I thoroughly enjoy my Nissan bottle but hate the mess theirs is always leaving because we have to make sure to keep wiping up the counter or papers and other things get wet and messed up. My Nissan bottle has also been dropped numerous times with no dents and stays upright all the time. Pay the few extra dollars and get a better product."
4,Going Green,"Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottle is a perfect size for my daily supply of H2O. At work we purchase bottled water for the entire department, and I'm doing my part of being green by re-filling my bottle everyday. Unlike my other reviews,I do not notice the steel flavor in the water. I only wish that I ordered the carrying straps when I purchased the bottle. Having dropped in once it is scratched on the bottom. Overall I would recommnend."
5,Excellent product,"The loop cap makes this extremely easy to carry. The opening of the bottle is the perfect size for drinking directly from the Kanteen. Easy to clean.I was actually going to purchase a Sigg, but saw another reviewers comments that he though Klean Kanteen was better. I'm very glad I went with this product, as there is NO inner liner required since it is stainless steel.Even though this is not aluminum, the weight is negligible."
1,"Great in theory, but pretty useless in practice","I got the 12 oz bottle with a loop cap and found that it leaks badly. I know it's not a wear and tear issue, since I noticed the leak the first time I used it (after one run through the dishwasher, and the bottle and cap are both supposed to be dishwasher safe). My conclusion: this bottle is definitely not secure enough to just toss into my bag with my school books. I guess it would have been fine if I'd planned to keep it in an upright cup holder in a car.Right now I'm kind of wishing I'd saved my money and not purchased this product, since it looks like I'll have to continue paying for one-time-use Poland Spring bottles."
4,Green Health!,"Klean Kanteen's are the answer to pure water and eco-friendly use. This is high quality food-grade stainless steel and does not leach and is toxin free. Plastic containers can leach toxins like 'Bisphenol A' which is linked to cancer. These Klean Kanteens are now very lightweight, so their is no need to camp, hike or bike with plastic bottles anymore. The cap is tight with a small plastic seal and a convenient loop handle.They are a little more expensive than plastic bottles, but when your health is concerned, there is no other option. Go stainless steel. Think Green!"
5,Does its job,"This bottle does its job well. It holds juice and coffee without keeping any odors. When the coffee sticks to the bottle, just rinse with vinegar."
3,NOT INSULATED,"This bottle is NOT insulated. I was going to buy this because I wanted to get a big bottle that can keep my drink hot and cold. But this was not made clear to me until it arrived at my house. However, its quality does look really nice and sturdy. If you are looking for a thermos, this DORS NOT WORK"
2,Leaky,I bought two of these for my kids. I put them in their lunch boxes and BOTH leaked water all over. I'm frutstrated. I will likely return these items.
3,Sports Cap...Fail.,"I own a 16 oz. with sports cap, and would like to point out that the cap has no control over leaks. The threaded twist cap contains a silicone washer which generally traps water in well, but the actual squirt sports cap is definitely ineffective...both ways. When drinking out of the bottle, 90 degrees from the mouth, water does not come out easily. When closing the cap and storing it horizontally, water leaks out of the cap.In conclusion...great bottle. A LOT stronger than the aluminum bottles on the market (drop them on asphalt or concrete once, they're permanently damaged), but the sports cap is awful. Go with the regular loop twist cap."
5,Love it!!,If you drink a lot of water you absolutely have to have one of these!! I love mine and actually own a 27 ounce for me and for my 6 year old daughter as well. They are great. The water tastes so good out of it-no plastic taste. I will be purchaing one for my husband as well.
1,sports cap leaks,"I like the weight and look of this water bottle, but with the sports cap no matter how hard I close it or how carefully i put it in my bag, it always leaks all over. it's basically useless, then, for travel."
5,Better than I thought,"I've seen them in stores before and always thought that they were a bit expensive for what you got, but when I received my order today I was pleasantly surprise. It's very good looking and the twist off cap was great. It arrived within 3 days with normal shipping. VERY IMPRESSED!"
1,hard on fillings!,"I drank from klean cantine for about a month. In the first week my fillings started getting sensitive. I didn't connect the two, however, it was quite immediate. I even went to the dentist who said he saw nothing and thought I may need a root canal! Then I thought about the water, stopped drinking from it, and my teeth are just returning to normal over a month later.In short, buy at your own risk.Me, I went SIGG."
2,Good luck getting the lid you want....,"Good bottle but good luck getting the lid you really want. Comes standard with screw-on lid so the sport (or other) lid has to be ordered separately. I ordered the sport lid which then caused price to go very high as the shipping for the lid I wanted was more than the lid by twice as much!! You can get the stainless bottle with the sport lid but not with the colored bottles?? I guess I'll just throw away the lid I do not want which is great for our environment, right Klean Kanteen folks? Having UPS/USPS stop by my house twice is good for the envoronment as well, right?"
4,Safer option for drinking water,"Like many, I've read the news bits here and there talking about how bad it is to keep water in the normal, plastic containers. I decided to upgrade to one of the 27 oz. Klean Kanteens and also bought my girlfriend one in pink. The quality is great but a little pricey considering the basic need it serves. I recommend the sports top for those using primarily during athletic activities, gym/yoga, etc."
4,"Very strong and good case, especially for the price.","Made out of aluminum with the cover sliding length-wise. Cover makes a nose when used and some people may consider it bulky since it doesn't comfortably fit in a pocket, thus the 4 rating. Visor holds secure without Velcro or anything else that you may have to use to hold Visor secure in traditional cases (very nice feature). Pen and infrared beam easily accessible. VERY strong and has a high tech look. Would recommend especially for the ... price, since I've seen the same case run ...in retail stores."
2,Not my kind of music,"After reading such good reviews, I decided to buy the CD. Only to discover it is not my kind of music. This is like a kindergarten kind of music."
5,Brings back the wonderful memories...,"The Nightmare Before Christmas Official Soundtrack has only 1 disc and contains all 20 tracks featured in the movie. The music and score composer and producer of this OST was Danny Elfman.The only extras you get with this CD is the booklet located inside the case which contains all the lyrics from the songs and sketches of Lock, Shock and Barrel."
5,Nightmare Before Christmas is AWESOME!,"I bought this for my girlfriend, who used to have a copy before it got lost, but I ripped a copy to my computer first because I love it too. Excellent quality for having been bought second hand. If I have need to, I will definetely shop with this seller again!"
3,easy read,"This was the first Nicci French book that I have read. Although I enjoyed it and read it in a day, I'm not anxious to read any of her other novels. I thought she chose an interesting subject for her main character, but could have developed a better story line. The narrative changed more than two thirds of the way through the story and the ending was strange, at the very least."
1,Too tight for bowstring,"I tried to install this on my PSE Kingfisher recurve bow, but the holes are just too tiny and the loop of the bowstring could not pass through it. Don't waste your money."
1,Does not fit the SCH-8500,"Regardless of what the manufacturer claims, this holster did not fit my Samsung SCH-8500 phone. It may work fine with the other phones, but not with that one."
5,living history,"This is one of the best documentaries I have seen, and certainly the best on Alexander. Michael Wood makes his subject come alive. Add to that, he knows his stuff and presents it in a way that is both accurate and engaging. The most interesting aspect of this documentary is the way he shows how the memory of Alexander remains alive in the folf memory of the people in the lands that Alexander conquered. From the perspective of a North American here on the West Coast where history is measured in a dozen or so decades, it's incredible to see bards singing in tavernas singing of the deeds of Alexander that are still as real in the minds of the people as if it happened yesterday."
3,Better than bad.,"I was going to tell myself not to compare this band to Interpol. But I just can't help myself. The best song on this album is Understanding the New Violence. The reason it is the best song is because it sounds most like Interpol. The rest of this album sounds like a up and coming band hoping one day to open for the bigger and better Interpol. I do enjoy this album however. It is not as hipnotic as Interpol, but it is good. There are some high points. Alot of it is very bland however. Its really had to explain. I would recommend this for any fan of Interpol. Its worth a listen. I will be very interested if they can follow this up with something great. I can tell they have great things to come."
5,Total Gym Pilates DVD,"While I think this is a great dvd, I did not realize I would have problems with my very old style of a total gym. I don't have all of the accessories and the appropriate accessories that you can buy will not work on the version of the total gym that I have. So, in order to utilize this dvd to the fullest, I need to completely purchase a new total gym for the low low price of $800. I'm thinking about it but haven't decided at this point."
3,A Little Boring,"I was hoping the workouts would be a little more challenging, and the instructor would be a bit more upbeat, but it's almost enough to put me to sleep. The background music is like elevator music which just adds to the slow mood. Most of the exercises are good, just not enough reps, so I am writing them down and I'll just do them on my own without the DVD playing. Also, the Total Gym I purchased came with a pilates kit, but it only included one foot strap, and this Total Gym DVD requires 2 straps for your feet. Hate that there have to be so many other purchases made after the first intial Totaly Gym purchase to get the kind of workout I want. Love our Total Gym, but if you can find a way to learn some pilates move without buying this DVD, I would reccommend that!"
4,Comprehensive and clear,"This handbook provides a comprehensive look at Cognitive Behavioral therapies and contains a lineup of incredible contributors including Beutler, Beck, Neimeyer, and many more. It includes a hisorical perspective, assessment issues, case formulation, RET, Cognitive therapy, and much more. Definitely a readable and practical book for the introduction of Cognitive Behavioral Therapies."
3,Why not iPod and Mac?,"I've been getting episodes of this show from the iTunes Store, but they are pathetically slow at posting new episodes. So, I'd love to try getting the show from Unbox--but alas Unbox supports neither the Mac nor the iPod/iPhone.Why????As for the show itself, it is pretty good, but is starting to drag in the middle. Also, it requires a LOT of willing suspension of disbelief--not unlike The Firm by John Grisham."
2,Damages-Stock Formula,"One more flavorless cookie rolling off the TV series conveyor belt baked from meanness, heartlessness, and an underlying despair. The centerpiece is that cardboard cutout of a strong woman defined as a female who makes cutting remarks to men and women, keeps her jaw clenched and holds out for more money. This centerpiece is surrounded by uninteresting people who spend time talking to other uninteresting people. Why do the billionaire villans always look sleek as a shark: why can't they be pudgy, with a passion for limericks and an obsessive superstition about green socks."
1,Video Plus - poor investment,"I bought this for my grandson almost a year ago (May 2009). We can't find the wire that connects the unit to the TV, so I called Publishers International to buy a replacement. They no longer make this unit and NO PARTS ARE AVAILABLE! This must be why the price has gone down so much. So basically what we have now is a piece of expensive junk.Publication International Story Reader Elmo Video"
3,Okay what's up with all the many pieces!?!,"I've gone through quite a few of these with my daughter and I hate the fact the straw itself comes in 3 different pieces. At first it's very frustrating to put the thing back together after getting it out of the dishwasher. After it's back together again it does the job and helps toddlers learn how to drink from a straw. Let me warn you though, these are not good for traveling b/c they will leak all over your bag if it's just thrown in there."
4,These are great for my 6mo old,"I love these cups, and this brand, as mu 6mo old is off the bottles and now on these full time. We love this style for rides in the car as she cant lift the cups up so the ones with the straw work great. We havent had any leaks and I think that it is a problem with the person putting it together incorectly. It only leaks is when its dropped on its nipple and left that way (like tipped over a toy) and the weight of the cup squeezes the nipple open. But laying on its side there is no leaking."
1,Plastic not durable,"I was so excited to give this to my twin girls, but after only FIVE minutes, it was tipped off of the highchair, landed on the tile floor, and literally shattered a gaping hole in the bottom of the cup. I wish I had anything to add about assembly or cleaning, etc., but I didn't get a chance to get that far after the initial washing. Very disappointed."
3,Not so great for parents.,"Thought I was buying anoher brand when I picked these up at the store. They are fine for kids to drink out of - my 15 month old loves it. But, as other reviewers have said there are WAY too many parts to clean. Also, it's hard to get the straw back in place. The bottom section of straw can fall off, making it hard for the child to drink. Last, but not least, my little guy tossed one of his on to a cement patio and it cracked the cup - no longer usable. So, I'm going to try another brand to see if they are a little bit easier & more durable."
4,"A great cup for babies and younger toddlers, not for older toddlers","I have to give this cup a lot of credit for lasting 6+ months with my then 1 year old. At first it didn't spill or leak and it was the ONLY sippy cup she'd take. The only problem I had with it was when you left it open it would let water out, not much but enough to spill onto a table. Not a big deal for us tho. But since my daughter has gotten older she's figured out the valve and now ""milks"" the water out and I can't use them anymore. They also have not held up well to my dishwasher, the valves wear down and the rubber cracks making them leak easier, they should really be replaced every few months. I'm now on the hunt for a new sippy but for 6 months these were great cups!"
1,NOT BPA FREE and it's terrible,"This item is not bpa free as described. The straw contains BPA. Also, this is a horrible product because you can not clean the straw. It is closed off at one end with only tiny holes and the other end is folded into the lid. If you take the lid apart, you can not put it back together. Had to throw ours away after a couple of uses (we purchased this before we knew it had BPA)"
1,These LEAK!,"I expected more from this brand of cup. They leak, badly. My son has been drinking from it and the cups have leaked on his shirt. They are awful especially if your little one happens to leave his cup on the floor some where. Puddles and sticky spots every where."
1,Doesn't work. Takes way too much effort. Frustrating,"I bought these for my 1.5 year old daughter, and she screamed every time I gave them to her. I tried to drink out of them and it was way too hard...Ridiculous design, probably really bad for kids' teeth. I threw them out."
1,Don't buy this product...,"I got these cups thinking they'd be great since they looked perfect for my little one. He likes the straw part and is easy enough for him to open and close the top. However, the cups leak (even when closed). I've used other cups that don't leak and from what I've read I'm not the only one with leaky cups. Get Nubby or Munchkin for they are by far better products."
1,Not dishwasher safe,I honestly can't believe the back of the package says this product is not dishwasher safe. Why not?Now that I have a dishwasher I do not intend to wash anything by hand that fits in that dishwasher. guess we'll take our chances.Also I'm not happy that after taking the straw assembly apart it will not go completely back in whic I know now from reading reviews means it'll leak. I'm going back to the platex version...which only leaks when my kids turn it upside down...or it's upside down in the diaper bag. I'll just deal that.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! KNOCKED OUT MY SON'S TOOTH!!!,"If you cherish your child's smile, do NOT buy this product. The hard knob that lowers the straw knocked out my son's tooth. He was walking across the living room, sippy cup in mouth, and tripped over his shoes. The knob of the sippy cup completely knocked out his tooth, root and crown and all. Think about how clumsy toddlers are. This is NOT a safe product for tots and definitely needs to be recalled. I do not even want to give it one star - it's horrible."
4,"Great value, must be assembled correctly for no leaks!","I started using the Nuby products as soon as my son started drinking from cups. We started with the Gripper Cup. Then when he got a little older we decided to move up to a straw sippy cup. The Mega Sipper works wonderfully and is such a great value. My son can easily grip it and we have had no leaks when assembled correctly.I will warn you that you must pay close attention to how it is assembled before you take it apart to clean it. I put it together wrong the first time and my son spilled milk all over himself. After closer inspection, I realized I hadn't pushed the valve all the way in which can take some work to do. Once I fixed that, no more leaks. I assume this is the problem all the other reviewers are having when they say it leaks.And as long as your little one doesn't use it as a teething toy, it will last a long time. Our Gripper Cups lasted nearly a year before the spouts began to degrade and leak a little."
4,perfect item arrives instantly!,"I ordered this product for a friend who ALWAYS spills her drinks. Thanks to this mega sipper, I now Queen Spillage by her biological name. I ordered this on Amazon with another product and this product came before the confirmation of the purchase of the other even hit my email. Thanks a bunch!~stephen"
4,A pain to clean but never leaks,"We have never had a leak with this cup, but it is hard to thread and a real pain that there are so many pieces to clean.We much perfer Nuby's other straw cups that are a lot simpler, the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N49ML8/ref=s9_simh_gw_p75_d0_i5?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=center-2&pf;_rd_r=1HNBH6G05ZMF34XEZF2V&pf;_rd_t=101&pf;_rd_p=470938631&pf;_rd_i=507846"
1,No help to improve mpg at all,"I tried Chevron Techron as people recommended here: meaning filled up it twice and also filled out my engine with Tufoil Engine Treatment and my mpg didn't improve at all.I drive 09 Accord EX-L V6 and constantly getting around 20mpg on 91/93 octane fuel driving from Brooklyn to Long Island on Belt & Cross Island Parkways. Mileage is horrible because there is never a steady speed and often traffics, but even when there is no traffic - still horrible 20mpg. I do write this review after 3 full tanks that were filled after 2 Chevron Techrons."
4,Millennium,A very interesting look at extraterrestrials reasons for there visits to Earth. Many characters view points help to tell the story. Fascinating.Millennium
2,not a favorite,"Love Doreen's books so I didn't even doubt I wouldn't like it, nor did I read the comments. I just purchased it, however, it just was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a deeper discussion. I suppose if you are absolutely new to this way of eating then it is a helpful start, but if you are already eating vegetarian style, you already know this info. It had conflicting suggestions for food choices, one of which was the use of canned soup and frozen vegetables. (it had previously mentioned that there was no ""life force"" in this type of food) The use of the ""Food Pyramid"" as a guide was not a plus. Again, if your a beginner, this is a great and easy start for you (congratulations for starting), otherwise you can pass and buy another of Doreen's wonderful guides."
5,You are my joy!,"I bought this book for my two foster children (ages 2 and 3) for Christmas. They LOVE this book. We read it all the time and they follow right along. The two year old will sometimes just say out of the blue - You are my joy! and run to get the book. The book is beautifully lyrical, conveying a feeling of security and love. The artwork is incredible and the three year old tells me that he is the one in the picture!"
5,Carl Perkins: A Life Worthy of the Drama,"Ordnarily, I have precious little interest in the histories of businesses or businessmen; I've always tended to focus upon intellectual, artistic, and spiritual visionaries. Carl Perkins, however, is a notable exception. I found his story by turns fascinating, hilarious, and poignant. I suppose if I were to describe Perkins' tumultuous life in a single word, it would have to be ""tragicomic,"" for his was a life worthy of the drama. I have watched this video several times now and found each viewing no less engrossing than the one before. Each time, I find myself wondering what a Shakespeare or a Hemingway might have written of Perkins' life.Highly recommended."
5,Edifying,"What an inspiring book to read. As a man of faith it's a must read for edifying one's soul. I am a third of the way into this awesome book and have created many highlights and notes! May you find much time with the Bible & this book which is full of Gods truth; and enhance your own life with the weapon of prayer! In Jesus name, amen. :-)"
3,"Not too shaby of a book, worth reading.",the books really good if your into short but still very exciting stories. kinda like every other of salvators books tho. but Elbryan is the coolest one of them all.
5,All your questions asnwered in one place,"A fantastic resource for people wanting to start an eBay consignment business. You can actually talk to the author if you have a question. This book is the real deal. If you're ready to start your new business, run, don't walk, to the book store and pick this up."
1,Steinbeck Centennial Collection,"I too can not tell which of Steinbecks works are in the Centennial Collection. And, I too am not about to spend $58.99 plus shipping when I haven't a clue what I'm purchaseing"
2,"Price is good, quality is questionable","I bought the SanDisk Sansa Speaker Dock almost a year ago and I rarely use it because I'm not too happy with the sound quality. Since I absolutely love my Sansa e130, I assumed the dock would be great, it's not. The music plays slow, reminds me of batteries wearing out BUT it's plugged in, so it's a mystery to me. Also, the volume is a problem too. It doesn't play loud and when I do have to change the volume, it's not an exact science (for lack of a better description).I would not recommend this to anyone but since I didn't pay too much, I'm not too annoyed (just disappointed)."
4,"Short, but exciting","I watched this video after I had read a book called 'Return with Honor' by Scott O'Grady. The book focuses on the same topic as the video, and even though the book is more thorough, and tells you more about the pilot, I found the video more exiting.'The Escape from Bosnia' is well structured, and the movie makers have been able to make this video exiting by switching between interviews with people that were involved, and reconstructions of what took place during that scary week in Bosnia.The only thing I did not like was the length of the video. I think that 50 minutes is a bit too short, as I did not think it was very good value for money."
5,"a wonderful movie, must see","i totally agree with the first review, it's a brilliant movie, a great Bette Davis performance, and Miriam Hopkins is perfect...for the part she plays...It's captivating, moving and very beautiful, go for it!"
5,"Coyote Summer, a historical novel","Coyote Summer, and the preceding book, The Morning River, provide the reader with a seamless reading experience of realistic entertainment. If you like historical novels where the author has mixed historical facts with the plot of his story you will enjoy both these books. Coyote Summer starts where the Morning River ends, and completes this saga. Very believable and entertaining, and set in the period when our country was expanding westward, this story is well written and made me feel like the events as presented could have happened in reality. Reading The Morning River first increased the pleasure of this experience for me. Enjoy!"
2,Early 50's Sex Film,"Tight sweaters and provacative scenes are what this movie is about. Poor acting and a stupid script are there just to fill time. However, the flying footage is great. If you aren't into vintage aircraft, don't waste your time or money."
3,Give Me A Break,"Great flying scenes do make this movie an aviation classic. But....That's as far as it goes. Duke, ya gotta be kidding-what the heck were you thinking! The acting and plot is way too predictable. It was really hard to enjoy tihs movie-definitley not one of the Dukes best acting jobs. Again, the flying scenes are great, and probably worth the price, but skip the rest of the movie."
4,Good Show - Bad Release,I personally really like this show but i think that its stupid for marvel or whoever to release it. Didnt they learn thier lesson with X-men Evolution which on its 3rd season release finally got a complete season set. Do your self a favor and wait a while who nows this show might follow the same path as the Batman. Which started off as 3 episode releases but then got season sets. if after a couple months Fantastic Four is still on 3-4 episode releases then get this dvd. but most likely or not you'll be able to rent this while you wait.
5,Great toy to pass the time for a toddler!`,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this pegboard. It helps with motor skills, teaches colors. You can even use it to teach math as per an elementary teacher, though i haven't tried that yet. very durable and you can take it anywhere!Highly recommended!"
3,"Ormond satisfies, Paxton not","I like to watch Julia Ormond work. She does her job in this film, but her co-star, Bill Paxton, fails to deliver a believable character. His bluff, ugly and clueless American irritates. I know he can do better than that. Was it the directing?The film deals with serious things, Partisans and hiding downed servicemen behind enemy lines. It could have had more impact with another male lead."
5,Truly a great comic book!,"I first heard about this on Comic Book Resources. From the great reviews there, I decided to check this book out. And I was not disappointed! Besides Amazing Spider-Man and Ultimate Spider-Man, this is the greatest superhero book I've ever had the pleasure of reading.The first set of issues' art wasn't that great, but when Ryan took over, the entire book improved, which seems impossible because it was already so awesome. And this book had one of the single, greatest twists a superhero book has ever had. I won't spoil it for you, but you need to buy this book RIGHT NOW!The price might seem like too much to pay for a comic book collection, but the extras in the back make up for it, and there's always going to be slightly cheaper used copies to buy here on Amazon.To recap: Awesome book, can't wait to read more, buy this now."
4,"my first Invincible, I love it","""make something simple complicated is commonplace, make something complicated easy, awesomely easy, that's creativity""Congratulations to all Invincible team. The story rocks, the characters are great and the bonus at the end of the book (drafts, scripts, data, profiles, etc) are a perfect adition. This is my first Invincible book and won't definitely be the last one (by the way, you can read the first chapter for free at imagecomics.com -that's why I bought the book)"
5,Great Product,This is the only product that I used on my dry cracked feet that within days my feet are soft and without cracks.....put it on after bathing or before bed with a pair of socks and you will be amazed at the great results....i
4,It works,I use this product for very dry skin. I find it to be very sticky but I use it anyway because it works!
4,works,This was recommended by a friend and I had my doubts ..but it really has made a difference to my nails which were such a mess due to stress and and the fact that I am a nurse and always washing my hands! I notice the difference if I stop using it for a while!
4,great product,"I love this stuff. I just wish it came in a big tube,the tub can be a little messy, but the cost is so much better in the bigger size."
1,Erotic ---- NOT,"This movie is dreadful. There is no chemistry between the actors whatsoever.The women have nice heads, but, bad implants. They look like they were dragged off the stage of your local go-go bar.I watched this movie once, now the spiders have a new home on my shelf! As a lifelong fan of G-G...my advice to everyone...SAVE YOUR DOUGH!"
1,Cheesey porn,I husband and I thought this movie would be alittle better then what it was. When we put it in it was just a cheesey soft porn. I was very dissappointed in it. For all those girls who watch porn with their special someone I wouldn't suggest this one. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The second blair witchproject was more of an erotic movie then this. two thumbs down!!!
3,seen better,i liked the movie i liked the way it had me on the edge of my seat but i have seen better movies
1,Bulking and Unprotective,This flimsy hodgepodge of velcro and nylon is both cheesey and bulky. Offers about as much protection for your handheld as a wet paper bag. On the positive side it has lots of cool looking but useless zippers and pockets that are sure to win over your nerdish friends. Comes with convienently hideous velcro strips that peel off and stick to the back of your handheld. Great if your throwing your pocket PC at a velcro dartboard.
3,NOT GREAT,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. NOT THE RIGHT SIZE AND HARD TO GET IN AND OUT OF CASE. GOOD DELIVERY TIME AND NEW.
2,A little better,"I got on once using the usb...it wasn't much better then using the wirless router, you still have to do the DS dance (trying to find the wirless connection) and it's still iffy, on the otherhand, I DID get on, where I did not, using my wireless router alone.Oneta"
5,Not a review,"Yes, I realize this is only for reviews but, does this thing work for your DS/WII if your wireless is extremely secure and its almost impossible to get all the right settings without changing everything?"
4,Easy to use and well priced,"We have been pricing these for the past month, and seeing the price here had us jump on the purchase. I am so glad we bought the actual Nintendo unit, because I am not a computer genius and couldn't figure out how to connect- not to worry... one quick call to the 800 number had a nice Nintendo rep quickly talking me through the process and had my son up and online in no time.The only downfall to actualy being on line is that there is no real level differentials, so beginners get whipped by the advanced early on, which has made my son a little shy of online gaming.... but other than that (which he will grow out of) the product itslef is great and easy to use."
4,Wireless connector to the internet,"This is a wireless internet connector that work great with my computer. It a great and fast working product, I love it."
5,A Must for Your Library!,"For those who wish to gain an objective understanding of Mary Lincoln, this book is for you. Well-read and educated, Mary Lincoln was simply ""born before her time.""And she endured tragedy that far exceeded Victorian expectations: She lost her mother at seven; several half-brothers were killed in the Civil War; three of her four sons died in their youth; her husband was shot while she was holding his hand. Her son, Robert, was a greedy snob who cared not for his mother during her widow years, but for her money.Mary Lincoln deserves a break!"
1,Annoying,"Husband HATES it! Makes my 2 year old son cry, but my daughter LOVES it. The characters can't sing and the jokes aren't funny."
5,I remember these songs.,I remember listening to those songs on a tape when I was in elementary school. I loved it. I played the tape on our tape player in our living room when I was in middle school and my mom says those were stupid. My dad told me that time it was for little kids.
1,Broken Mask upon taking out of package,"We got this for our daughters birthday since she wanted a Hawk Girl Birthday theme for her party. The mask was brittle and broke in multiple places when we took it out of the package. The packaging was stronger. Maybe they should just make the mask out of the packaging material?Anyhow, the wings were floppy and didn't hold shape at all. We have bought a lot of superhero costumes over the years and this was by far the worse. It is a shame."
5,Absolutely adorable,I cannot say how many compliments I've recieved since putting this cover on! It fits like a dream and is very easy to install over my current graco carseat. If only the toddler one went on sale like this one! I'll keep watching......
5,a study of mentors,"The concept of the mentor is fraught these days with the idea of the eager young business school graduate looking to position himself in the light of a beneficent elder who can guide our eager young MBA through the thickets of corporate culture.What, pray tell, does this have to do with the contents of a book by Rilke, you rightly ask yourself. Consider the concept of a mentor: the person who is supposed to guide you, to whom you turn for answers to questions you realize your family is too biased to provide, upon whose experience you rely. Rilke, in this book descibes his aesthetic sense, that is, how the poet is to relate to the world, to make sense of the world about which he writes.It is a beautifully elegant and simple theme. Those seeking mentors would do well to carry this book around and heed its lesson that the mentor you choose should not be the person with the most accolades but the person with the most empathy for you."
3,Not what i acpected or thought i was buying,"OK i will say this great service on this product but as i was whatching the movie theres a part where the movie cuts out and theres about7 sconds of footage where it was bieng spliced bits of cut footage of a woman that appers for a second or so, it looks like somone tryed to cut the movie and then do a crapy job of putting it back together agine and a real crapy job im gonna keep it but for the amount of money i payed for it not a good deal the only reason im keeping it is because i am a collecter of B movies and this certanly qulyfies-but i just think this dealer and others shold review thier stock beofr they sell it and should state whats wrong with it, personaly i think he knew waht was wrong with it if he wasent the one who tryed to spliced it but he did not list it I do felt riped off but im going to keep it 80 bucks is not worth it but then agine i am a collecter."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"This is not a 14 hour documentary about New York City, instead it is a 56 minute long documentary about how the old Electric Subway in NYC was built in 1900, as seen on public television and ""American Experience""."
5,Fast Delivery. Well-priced item. Good value.,Service was fast and accurate. I would highly recommend this vendor.
5,Enchanting Meadow,"This is a wonderful product. It is silky smooth and smells marvelous. I first found it in Canada, and Amazon always has the link available to purchase more when I run out."
4,Fun game,"My daughter enjoys playing with this game. There are various games, and when changing from one game to the other one has to wait for Belle to speak all the options. This takes a while, and my daughter gets impatient. The food game and the one where a dance is created are fun. The best is the guessing game, as it fosters skills like listening, observation, focus on details, deduction, logic, and making educated guesses. All in all it is a good game."
4,It doesn't suck,"The phone is much slimmer and sleaker than the other phones that Nextel offers. The speaker quality of this phone is outstanding. Also, the disco light is a neat little add on that makes this phone fun. The quality of the reception is good and the features of the phone are very cool. The price is high, but I think it was worth it."
1,ONE HOT MESS!!! THE ABSOLUTE WORSE NEXTEL PHONE,"This phone has to be the worse out all of the Nextel phones. Because I work in a quiet atmosphere, I usually use ""Private"" (turning the speakerphone off) when I am on Direct Connect calls. The earpiece got so bad on the phone, that I could never hear what the person was saying when using the feature. Then the earpiece went completely out on the phone. I was livid because this phone wasn't even 3 months old when this problem started. The phone is horrible. Just overlook all of those 5-star reviews because you would just set yourself up!!! The only thing that is good about this phone is it is pretty!!!!"
2,A Below Average Phone,"I had a Motorola i90 phone that went bad, so I upgraded to the the i730 and I wished I'd never done it. I don't know exactly what it is, but the quality of service is far worse on the i730 than the older i90. I didn't have service in a lot of areas that I had service before. So I finally got an i850, and believe me that phone is a whole lot better. The call quality is better, the service is better, and the battery life is a lot better. If you are thinking of getting a nextel phone, skip this one and go for the i850. You won't regret it."
1,Do not Waste Your Money,This is my second Nextel phone. I upgraded for a smaller phone and this one seemed to have all the features I needed. This phone has a terrrible signal reception and drops calls / and or service 12 -15 times a day. I have already had the phone looked at by Nextel and Motorola and they say nothing is wrong with the phone.
5,Interesting!!!,This is an interesting 70's movie about several people in an encounter group and one person who is a menacing threat to this group.Very Intersting Indeed!!!
2,I love the cover,"The title track on this album is a forgotten classic, but I agree you'd be better off just downloading that one song and leave the rest alone. The only other reason I can think to buy this album is for the picture on the cover which is absolutely hilarious. It depicts a woman dancing in front of a man who appears to be Richard Nixon. Put in context with the 70's it's obvious that the title ""Shame Shame Shame"" is being used as a reference to the Watergate scandal that was unfolding at the time of the song's release. Looking closer it even appears that the woman is trying to pick Tricky Dick's pocket! It really cracks me up. And yes, the audio here is a big disappointment also, but what a great song!"
4,Nice but dull,"Very nice and practical but I would have preferred the finish to be polished instead of brushed stainless. Other than the finish, no complaints. Very functional and well made."
5,Just what I needed!,"Although this appears to be nothing more than an expensive stainless steel bucket, it is perfect for my kitchen scrap storage. The filter really does keep the odor from my kitchen. I find it can hold about a week's worth of scraps (unless I get crazy cooking). The wide mouth allows me to put the vegie peels or coffee grounds in without touching anything inside or spilling it all over the counter. It's easy to empty, and easy to clean. It looks nice on my countertop, unlike the plastic pail I had previously. I have had this for about 6 weeks now, and the filter appears to be working just fine. I will have to find out about replacements."
5,deep plug cutter,"works like a dream, my wife said those are cute little buttons ? what she's talking about? What the plugs that I had just cut, cute ??? Well I guess so, who is to argue with that, not me! if you know what I mean. But they do work rather well. deep or not works great."
1,CD Broken,"I got this product as a gift and the cd was working fine for a few days... and now it's broken. Same problem as many others have reported... even though the disks are in the system it says no disks and is not able to play any kind of disk. Very very disappointing. I will never purchase JVC again, very unreliable."
2,"Sounds great, CD player dies","Great appearance and sound, JVC has produced a nice sounding unit. Speakers look as great as they sound, no problem handling bass at loud levels. Tuner is very easy to use, USB input works flawlessly. Now the bad news, the CD mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any CD, whether store bought or MP3 burned. First unit died after three weeks, the replacement lasted five. CD player mechanical design is unable to handle light use. Will think twice about buying a JVC again..."
1,CD changer died - can't get a replacement part for warrantee,"Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for ""more than 3 weeks."" I hope they will replace my unit with something that works."
3,No Support,"The software is limited. You cannot enter new ingredients that are not within the program itself. The software lets you enter new items from USDA items but only those listed within the program. This list is by no means complete. Also, I registered on their website for support. My login and password were confirmed but to date it does not let me login. I sent an email about a week ago and am still waiting for a response. I think I will be going back to using the MasterCook program."
1,DOES NOT DELIVER,"...nutrient information. I purchased hoping to get nutrient information for recipes rather than having to calculate for each ingredient. The website promised much in this regard, but does not deliver. You have to add the nutrient info yourself...I can do this in any software. I have never left a review before - I hope this saves someone money."
4,"Marriage,Census & other Indexes",Brilliant book. I got plenty of information and managed to trace other members in my Family Tree. Well worth the money
4,Paul Newman: A Life in Pictures,"Being that my husband and I are huge Paul Newman fans made this book a real family treasure. We've enjoyed his films over the years and seeing him on these pages brings back many fond memmories. I only wished that more of his photographs in character had been made available. Paul's various character roles were all so exciting like; Juan Carrasco, ""Fast"" Eddie Felson, and Ben Quick just to name a few. This edition was well worth the money and will be enjoyed for years to come."
3,Worthwhile but windy,"There's good information in this book, but you have to wade through a lot of verbiage to get to it. The authors appear to know their stuff, but they do tend to make the same points over and over. I found myself flipping pages to get past the stuff they'd already told me. Still, if this tome keeps you from falling victim to the many ""wholesale"" scams out there, it will have been worth reading. Don't look for lists of suppliers, because there aren't any. What you will get are some basic principles (sometimes spelled out rather vaguely) on how to identify legitimate suppliers on your own. The title promises somewhat more than the book delivers, but it's worth reading, anyway."
1,What to sell on Ebay and Where to get it.,"Title is very misleading. Never a mention of particular products or sources to find them. A lot of good marketing info but, no specifics.Sorry, but I cannot recommend this to anyone."
2,Avoid Maxtor,Have bought a couple of Maxtor hard drives over the years and have finally given up on them. All (especially external usb and ethernet) tend to run warm and to start having problems shortly after the one year warranty is over. Stay with western digital or some other brand.
1,There goes my family photos,"When this fails, and it will due to the intense heat buildup inside (The 50 cent fan they used failed on mine), there is no way to restore the drive, nor replace it with a new internal drive due to its unique formatting. Maxtor suggests using a data recovery service for half a thousand dollars. I could have used that and the original purchase price of this boat anchor to buy a Drobo. Google Maxtor NAS failures or problems and be ready; it reads like a horror novel."
3,A True Gem in the Rough: To be or Not to be a Monk,"Phra Peter has taken the time and effort to enlighten us about the inside world of Buddhist monks as they practice in Thailand and England. He shares the outer and some of the inner details of his passage from public personality to respected (and oft times ridiculed) White Foreigner in Orange Robes that keep falling down.Phra Pannapadipo's exploits, as he makes his way in and out of various circles of influence are both comical and dead serious as fate has presented him with numerous exciting and totally unexpected twists at every corner.This is also an excellent guide to many aspects of Thai culture as well as thorough documentation of religious practices and theology today in one of Southeast Asia's most exotic countries.A rare find, any of the author's books is a true gem in the rough to be treasured by seekers of any orientation."
1,Not what I expected,"I fell in love with ""thyme"" honey when traveling in Greece. This product bears no resemblance to what I had there and, frankly, I dislike the taste. Will be throwing it out."
5,"An introduction to Subud, and its effect on life","This is a straightforward introduction to Subud, examining the effects of this spiritual exercise on various spheres of human life: relationships, family, work, culture and religion. The early years of Subud are also recounted."
2,Only for a diehard collector,"Another Disney Soundtrack CD with some star names doing rare songs to draw a collector in. I'm not a fan of Disney music, but I had to have the song by Ruth Pointer being a major Pointer Sisters fan. STREETS OF GOLD is really a pretty good song . Same could be said for the Billy Joel song, and the Huey Lewis song isn't bad. But Bette Midler's is a sickeningly sappy piece of Broadway schtick where Bette lays on the sweetness so heavy it made me get my soundtrack to THE ROSE out as an antidote. It's such schmaltz that made me cringe listening to this awfully bad song. Bette even tries to approxmate sound effects during this song "" produced "" by Barry Manilow. Fittingly, it's followed by a song sung by a young girl, and at least she's of age for such sweet sappy songs. The fantasy world of Disney music isn't my cup of tea."
5,Artichoke capsules,"The Nature's Way Artichoke Capsules are good for cholesterol and Triglycerides, so that is why I bought them. I hope they work."
1,Boring book by a great author,"Very disappointed. I read the title of the book but I didn't expect it to be just a super-green fluffy, boring story. I usually love this author's work."
4,is a feel-good CD for just belting out the lyrics.,"The Muses. They are surely the best vocals in the whole CD. Susan does nicely as Meg, making track 10 my favourite as she sings 'I won't Say'. I could sing that song anywhere, any time. The Muses (of course) add a nice 'oldies' background to Susan Egan's forceful voice. This CD is something you can listen to to pick you up, if you go for musical soundtracks."
2,Average bag,Great storage with lot's of pockets. Because of the strap design will not stay and place on your shoulder and constantly slips off. Probably better suited to using the belt clip. ID & credit card holders are very tight. The ID holders actually start to come apart at the seams rather quickly. Color faded after one wash in very mild detergent and cold water. Already looking for a replacement after less than a year.
2,Exam 70-271,"The book arrived very late.....two weeks after I ordered, was a bit dissappointed because I anticipated that the book will arrive early."
2,Poor correlation between objective review & practice questio,"More like a cook book, e.g. recipes for opening menus/sub-menus. ""Objective review"" question explanations are keyed to book. ""Practice questions"" on CD are keyed to courses offered through Microsoft and not the book. Many practice question subjects, e.g. Software Security Policies, VPNs, IEEE1394 pin/power supply, modification of boot.ini, Active Directory, WinXP power options, not covered.If objective review questions represent actual exam -great. If the practice tests on CD represent exam - you need other study material."
2,Book decent...CD..Measure Up should be embarrassed,"The Book was decent. In some cases the book only covers enough detail to make you realize you need to search elsewhere for answers. And that's okay. There are only a few minor errors in the book. Worth a study.The CD that is packaged with it comes from Measure Up. I think a chimp must have done the editing on the questions. There are questions where the graphic does not even go with the question. Others where you are not allowed to choose all the necessary answers. Some are just out right wrongly answered.I wrote Measure Up a nasty gram. I can't believe the poor quality.This is as much Microsoft Presse's fault as it is theirs though.Anyway, I take my exam today. I feel prepared but only because all these errors in the questions actually caused me to dig for the correct answers. Not a fun way to study.If I could go back and start over, I would purchase something else."
4,Good MS study guide,"I have to agree with the comment that this book goes a lot further than previous MS texts. It actually tries to give you enough info to pass the exam rather than giving you inadequate info so that you get hit with questions far removed from what you learnt. I suspect the latter is because MS want to make their exams as hard as possible what with the proliferation of MCSErs. I mean think about it - why would Microsoft want to make it easy for you to pass their exams? They want you to WORK for their qualification and dont want paper MCSE candidates. I have this book but nevertheless I obtain a lot of info from other sources.I agree this book is far removed from MS 72-270, 70-215 etc study guides. Its a good book!"
1,cracking in the middle,i have to get another one after a year of use because it's literally splitting down the middle.
2,Not very well made,"I was disappointed with the quality of this product. The height adjustments were not all usable, since the angle of the adjustment slot only allowed one position to be used. It's usable, and I'm keeping it, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Amazing!,"This is honestly one of the best anime I've ever seen. I loved the animation, the characters, everything. I loved this one especially, but also the series in general. It's wonderfully realistic. Most anime are whacky fantasies, which I enjoy, but don't feel for. Rurouni Kenshin is real, complete with the love, war, hate and strife that comes with real life. I am very interested in swordplay and fencing. This is the perfect series. The animation is beautiful and you get an indepth view into the characters and their fighting. It's not just people hitting each other, but logistics and reasonable weaponry with practical answers to each amazing trick of the eye. Keep in mind that the animators are not afraid to show a bit of blood and gore. This is not the best show for younger viewers. But the brutal beauty and sheerness of the violence itself brings out something very rare. Anime fan, or if you just want a good story, this series is the best !"
3,O.K. as a reference,There are only two new chapters in this edition.All other chapters are the same as previous editions;even the problems are unchanged. A better reference is the book by A. Bruce Carlson.
2,Good information but very badly written,"This book has some interesting stuff in it but the style is terrible. There are loads of unbelievably bad metaphors and plenty of trashy sensationalism. Still, if you want to find out about a bit more about one of the greatest bands around then give it a try."
1,Disappointing & Revisits Old Stereotypes,"I'm always delighted to find a book that includes a character with autism. If that character has any special talent or ability, then more often than not that character is written as a cookie-cutter formulaic savant. To make matters worse, sooner or later others in the story compare the character to R*** M**, the title role Dustin Hoffman played in a 1988 movie. Most people with autism with or without savant abilities are NOTHING like that cliche character and R** M*** is a highly offensive slur in the autism world. I am sick and tired of savant stereotypes, especially since savantism affects less than 10% of the autistic population!"
1,trash,trash book all the way.the author should PAY ME for spending time to read it.i wonder how much money he paid the publisher to publish this trash.this book is not even funny.what a waste of my time.p.s. amazon should hv a ZERO star box.
2,"Please hire an editor, Tom","I really wanted to enjoy this book. However, it is SO poorly written, I just couldn't get into it. Tom, you are a zillionaire. You can afford an editor."
3,cell holder,"This was a quality product, however it wasn't large enough to hold my phone. Great product for phones smaller then the I phone."
5,Geometric Shapes and Nets,"Excellent resources for teaching geometric solids and their nets. The plastic nets contained within each polygon fold out so that students can easily see the shapes that make up the polygon. You can purchase a set of solid transparent tiles for use with a transparency projector that compliment this set of solids. This additional set contains tiles showing the outlines of the geometric and solid colored tiles in the shape of the net. For example, the geometric solid of a hexagonal prism has a yellow plastic net folded inside the clear plastic solid. This net can be removed and unfolded. There are two tiles (in the complementary set)which coordinate with this shape - a clear tile with the outline, in yellow, of the hexagonal prism's edges, and a transparent yellow tile in the shape of the hexagonal prism net.I found these resources a vast improvement over the Power Solids that are traditionally used in Middle School. The price is also excellent."
4,Great Visual,Great for showing the nets for surface area. Was happy to see that they changed the layout of the cylinder net so that it no longer resembled a body part as it did in an older set.
1,They stiffed me!,The company denied my order. No reason given. I think they may have under priced it and reniged (sp)on the order.
1,POS,"After 30 years of Stanleys (in the good ole days they would replace the blades for free or the whole tape if the post broke), I read some reviews saying Lufkins were better. They are NOT. Even my wife after attempting to help me use this limber POS called it a limber POS and she very rarely swears. My language improved a lot after i replaced it w/a new Stanley and now i once again don't need my wife's help to measure so we're both happier."
3,more like a 3.5,"I was given this CD along with That Darn Cat soundtrack ( a total F cd- not worth buying) . The songs on this are a reminder of my childhood. It is songs, by the original artist. For the most part the cd is pretty good with songs the 30+ crowd remembers."
4,"Great for the money, and beginners","i got this a little under a year ago.. i 've been playing for 7 years but this is my first electric so i started off low. this is great! i mean you can't really cure the buzzing on the E string, but it gets the job done, it sounds petty clean and great with riffs, i have really gotten used to the weight and size, both fairly small. this finish is not what it really looks like in reality. its looks brighter and less... plain. the pickups are really nice also with the body, again.. the sound... lets compare to a... toy store guitar as a 1 to a Gibson is 10... its a 9. this is overall a really great guitar. i totally recommend."
4,Good,"I bought this for my dad. He seemed to like it but he said it was a bit short. He was happy though. He is into that type of thing, anything religious."
3,"Ok, but not as good as my other German-made water bottle","This water bottle is easy to fill and has a good ""ribbed side"" vs. smoother side. But my other hot water bottle that says ""Faultless Made in Germany"" is a bit thicker and when I wake up in the morning, it is still SLIGHTLY warm. This Fashy one is fine but it gets cold in the middle of the night and is disruptive so I have to toss it out of my bed. I NEVER do that with my other one....I just stay asleep all night without a cold thing touching me and waking me up. Too bad I can't find my original anywhere. :-("
5,Blown away,I am amazed at the quality of this product. I was blown away by the sound of this compact unit. It rivals that of my full size stereo system. I would definately recommend it to anyone who is looking for a compact system but doesn't want to compromize sound quality. The fact that it also plays dvd's is a bonus.
3,Newer is not always better,"The new JVC FS-Y1 replaces their old FS-1000 that served me extremely well for some 8 years. When the 1000 suddenly stopped working, I ordered the new FS-Y1, since it is about the same size and fits in the space available. However, by making the Y1 interface with video components, JVC overcomplicated a user-friendly remote with lots of unwelcome buttons. Anytime the buttons for the main function of a radio are hidden behind a sliding plate on the remote, designers have lost sight of the customer's priorities--not to mention the customer losing sight of the buttons. In short, the beautiful simplicity of the 1000 gives way to the annoying complications of a hybrid machine that probably would not be the choice of anyone who needs a tuner for video."
2,Water logged,"These boats are fantastic! They are fast. Really fast. If you love speed boats, this is the video for you!"
5,This is for people who like behind the scenes stuff...,"Don't judge this as another Zappa album. It's a little documentary of the rehearsal of some of the best music you'll ever hear (Great Wazoo and Waka/Jawaka). The sound quality is not the same as a real album - that's not what this is. But if, like me, you've listened to those two albums with pure admiring pleasure, you might find this little peek into the process of their creation very interesting. I guess not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it!I'm giving it 5 stars because it was such a pleasant surprise for me to run across this CD; I didn't know this material existed."
2,cheap quality,"cheap quality.. I don't recommend it. The spinning section wiggles and you grow tired of it, about 2 minutes after wearing it"
3,It was fun seeing this again.,"As a Houdini fan, I was thrilled to find this DVD. However, it is a foreign copy of the movie and has oriental subtitles. Which I couldn't remove. Nonetheless, I was happy to find the movie and enjoyed watching it again. Now if I can just find the Paul Michael Glaser version!"
1,"If you are a true Green Day fan, fanatic or anything, dont waste your money!!","As like everyone else, i was super excited about this DVD. i got the express shipping and everything. All it is, is POGO PARADISE, an older DVD which sucked ass, which most of the information isnt ever 100% correct. It was such a dissapointment, and a huge let down. I wanted to cry when the title of the movie started and said POGO PARADISE. the only good thing about this DVD was the cover artwork. that was it. !!!!FORTUNATELY!!!! GREEN DAY will be releasing an AUTHORIZED dvd of their LIVE SOLD OUT SHOW at the milton keynes arena from europe. From the American Idiot tour... Im very excited, and i know for a fact it wont be a dissapointing DVD. www.greenday.net has small info on it.DONT BUY THIS HISTORY OF GREEN DAY... horrible!!!!!!(...)Anthony"
3,Average transfer switch,"The panel labels are ugly and poor qualiy. The panel hasn't door (I already knew it). The breakers haven't good mark of ON or OFF position. The flexible tube is too rigid. I think it will do the job, but I was expected a better product."
4,One of the most memorable relationship books I've ever read.,"I read this book in the late 70's at the age of 25 after my divorce. It lives up to its claim that you will be able to read about yourself, your parents and many others around you. It helped me understand the reasons why some relationships went sour and why I wanted others to. Also, the writing style is very entertaining. I have recommended this book to many friends that have found themselves in a similar situation."
5,A painfully necessary reading requirement.,"A wonderfully eye-opening experience into the working intricasies of the long term relationship. Why we do the things we do depending upon the type of personalities that we have and how that relates to our partners.A definition of ourselves, the different stages of the relationship and the reasons behind them."
2,Not what I expected,"Half of this book is about a modern RAF crew recreating the famous Dam Buster Raid of May 1943. There are many photographs, some of them color, but the sections of modern recreation are rather annoying. I didn't manage to finish this book and I'm looking elsewhere for a decent book about the subject."
3,"overpriced, but good recipes.","The book is little and a bit overpriced. Its a softcover and has less recipes than I imagined. Its a nice addition to a cooking library though. My mother is hungarian and she was interested in it overall, for the recipes are all classic hungarian."
5,"Written with memories, traditions, and lore","Now in a newly expanded edition, Hungarian Cookbook: Old World Recipes For New World Cooks by Yolanda Nagy Fintor (who learned cooking from her Hungarian mother) introduces the reader to a culinary wealth of truly great recipes that have been passed down through generations of Hungarian cooks via an oral family tradition. Featuring not only recipes with meticulous instructions, but also memories, traditions, and lore from those who have prepared and shared such dishes as New World Creamy Potato Soup, Sweet And Sour Cabbage, and Beer Bread Sticks, the Hungarian Cookbook is very highly recommended for anyone seeking to learn about, create, and taste the flavors and culinary traditions of Hungary."
1,A Disgrace for Disney,"This is a MUST RETURN item. Don't destroy your sales receipt! I can't believe that this product was manufactured and created with the latest computer technology available in the year 2000. It is confusing, frustrating, illogical, and the 3D animation received a big ""thumbs-down"" by all users. Not even the HELP files can save an adult's self-esteem and sanity. The kids will run screaming from the computer when you drag this one out..."
4,For Hardcore Street/Track Racers,"Great camera work, very informative. Nice to see cars and technology from Japan. Commentators know their subject.Still trying to get used to Japanese humor."
5,Memories of Mexican Bliss!,"My mother either bought or was gifted this little treasure before I was even born, back in the late 40's (in southern California). She cooked from it quite often and I have wonderful childhood memories of the flavors of all the various dishes. A few years ago, I opened a box of books that was left to me when she passed away and was so pleased to find this one. I was hoping to find a newer version of this to purchase, but I can work from the old one, even with splatters of sauce on some of the pages. Occasionally I even block out some time to make the out-of -this-world tamales. Heaven!Very highly recommended!Elena's Famous Mexican and Spanish Recipes"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was very very disappointed to find your joke of a sizing of hats. This xlarge hat is hardly even a large. My 12 year old nephew cuoldn't get this (supposed xlarge ) hat on if I gave him a 1100 dollars. What good is a hat is you can't wear it???????? Look at is on a shelf I guess.Yeah you asked me to review it and you put my wife's name on it. It's my acct. STUPID, can't you get it right???????????????"
1,A poor attempt at ripping off The Evil Dead!,"I just saw this movie on On-Demand and needless to say it wasn't worth the celluloid used to make it! First of all the acting is some of the worst I have seen in a horror movie since The Night of the Demons, Next this movie was not only not funny in the least but also the bad ""special effects were too noticable! I hated most of the characters and found them irratating not to mention bogus! The nudity was good but that's about it! The first 45 minutes were completely boring and the whole movie just dragged its feet in general! All there is to note other than this was 2 things a)This garbage is NO EVIL DEAD and for the On-Demand desciption to suggest it is pure Sacriledge and b)The tragic ending involving evil winning was not just tragic but it was predictable to anyone like myself who's seen that bad horror ""The Granny""!"
3,OK,"This toy was cute but had several problems with voice recognition. Read the instruction before attempting to play with, if not your child will be fustrated and not want to play with it anymore."
2,funny furby story,"I have a funny story about the original Furby. I was teaching in a small private school. We had just passed a ""NO FURBIES"" rule for obvious reasons. We didn't even want to hear them from the cubbies. About an hour after school started, I got a call from the mother of 2 of our girls who owned several Furbies each. Mom was frantic. She was at a red light and desperate to get all these Furbies to shut up, but the more she yelled at them, the more they talked to her. I told her she was going to have to get all of them to go to sleep and to imagine why we had to pass a rule against having them in our small space. I don't think she allowed them in her car again."
3,Love A-Frames,I love A-Frames and this book is OK except I find the print to be a bit light. It is printed in CHINA where the wurld is made.
2,Entertaining read but not help at all,"I read this book hoping to learn some things about getting women but come away just as inept. The book is written with humor making it an easy read but the advice is basically useless. I was also a little upset when I noticed the back cover and the very good looking author that adorns it. The guy is an adonis. He must think we're all fools to try to convice us that he's bad with girls. NO WAY! It's a slap in the face. That guy can get women without even opening his mouth because he's that good looking. I don't care how ""bad"" he thinks he is with girls. He can tell them he likes lunchmeat and they'll be all over him. Basically what I learned is that you get girls by being born with the skill. No amount of teachings will ever help. So I take with me the knowledge of never purchasing another ""How To"" book about getting girls because now I'll know better. Hope this helps."
1,Ridiculous Fairytale,"I cannot believe how many people gave this book 5 stars! It's totaly unbelievable and downright silly.Anastasia is a super woman who can leap tall trees, has no need for shelter and no need to store food. She eats blades of grass and squirrels bring her nuts even in winter. She doesn't even have a hut and barely needs clothes. Yet she lives in the Siberian Tiaga where temperatures have been recorded as low as -72F. For goodness sake even animals look for shelter.Her wisdon is preposterous!I am an avid reader of spiritual and metaphysical ideas but this book did not arouse in me ""good and radiant feelings"" only boredom and the awarness that I wasted my money."
1,Crackpot Nonsense,Anastasia is simply badly written crackpot nonsense. I can't imagaine why it was published. Don't waste your time or money on it. I'm sorry I did!
2,Cashing in on hope,"I managed to finish this book, although it was difficult. It is poorly written, and is very difficult to read. It has many contradictions, and I didn't feel inspired by it at all. I only gave it a 2 because I did finish it.In my opinion this author is just cashing in on ""hope"". He is wanting people to believe there is an ""Anastasia"" out there. Megre, by his own admission is a ""businessman"", and there are alot of people out there who want hope - myself included. I did not get it from this book. I felt more cheated than anything. I will continue with my own spiritual journey, and turn to guides who truly have something to teach me. Thankfully I did not purchase the book, and I certainly won't be buying any others in the series.If Anastasia truly did empower him to write what she was trying to convey to him, she needs alot of help with her ability to inspire! Nice try, but I'm not buying it."
1,nextel customer service incredibly bad and incompetent,"Well trying for NINE HOURS ON THE PHONE TRYING TO ACTIVATE MY NEXTEL, I ENDED UP SENDING IT ALL BACK FOR A REFUND.THE SERVICE IS SPOTTY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.DO NO BUY A NEXTEL PHONE, IT CANNOT BE ROLLED OVER TO ANY OTHER SERVICE.DO NOT BUY A NEXTEL PHONE........YOU WOULD BETTER OFF BANGING YOUR HEAD WITH A TIRE IRON FOR NINE HOURS THEN BUYING ONE OF THESE PEICES OF CRAP OR TRYING TO DEAL WITH THESE COMPLETE IDIOTS.DO NOT BUYDO NOT BUYDO NOT BUY"
3,wHAT A SHAME !,"oF COURSE, mARY cOSTA'S VOICE IS A DELIGHTFULLY REFRESHING ONE... bUT FIRST, THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLY INCOMPLETE AND, SECOND, WHO WILL GIVE US MARY MARTIN'S SPARKLING PERFORMANCE, BOTH AS A NARRATOR AND AS A SINGER ?"
1,HORRIBLE!,"ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING WITH ALL THOSE PREVIOUS GREAT REVIEW? WHAT PLANT ARE YOU PEOPLE ON! I MEAN I'M FROM NEW YORK MAYBE THAT'S IT!THIS WAS PROBABLY THE WORST CD I EVER BOUGHT! WHAT A LET DOWN! THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS ""DO YOU WANT TO GET FUNKY WITH ME"" THAT'S IT! LISTEN, I LOVE CLASSIC DISCO EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY 13/14 YRS OLD WHEN ALL THIS BECOME POPULAR, BUT GIVE ME A BREAK, I JUST DON'T GET THE WHOLE CD, I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THE OTHER SONGS.DON'T BUY IT! NOW I KNOW WHY THEY MAKE SINGLES AVAILABLE!"
5,Peter Brown/wow/Available now! Awesome w/hifi system,"This album (now on cd) is absolutely an awesome and beautiful piece of work. From Rough ""Do you want to get funky"" to Beautiful ""Without Love"" This cd is a must have. I have several of the lp's of this very cd and finally I found an Album that wasn't opened and still sealed. I was waiting to record on to a high end digital media but now to my surprise the cd is out. I'm 35 and my 13 year old daughter also fell in love with Peter Brown's Fantasy Love Affair titled album. You will too."
3,Dog loves them,"Based on other reviews, I expected these rawhide chips to be much thicker than they were. The two bags I received were about medium thickness overall, with some thin pieces mixed in. Also, they changed the picture and seller right after I ordered them, so I don't know if future orders will receive the same thing I did. (The rawhide chips I received looked much lighter in color than the current photo, more like the ones you find in stores, and came in two 1-lb bags.)Initially, my dog took the rawhide, walked around with it, sniffed it and then walked away. He came back to it an hour or two later and ate it and hasn't done that again, so maybe it was just a slightly new smell to him. Now he loves them and they barely hit the floor before he snags them and runs to his pillow to chomp on them."
5,Last awhile,"I used these on a LRP.28 in a losi XXL and they bite hard, and last a lot longer then the stock ones, or OFNA purple shoes."
2,Goethe revealed,"I bought Theory of Colours by Goethe because I thought I would gain insight into color in the most intimate way. To help me become a better painter. But when I got to the point where he says in relation to the skin color of humans: ""to assert that the white man, that is, he whose surface varies from white to reddish, yellowish, brownish, in short, whose surface appears most neutral in hue and least inclines to any particular or positive colour, is the most beautiful."" when I read that, I was seeing 'the man behind the curtain', a racist. He had no answers for me, no longer do I feel I can count on a person whose thoughts lead him to this conclusion, that the white man is superior. I'll take my colors just as they are, all beautiful!"
3,Extremely Large,"We bought these for our son who plays soccer, I think they would still be too big for my husband who plays soccer! They are huge! Nice quality but to big to be considered youth in my opinion."
4,review for this book,this product was delieved in a short time. A+ for that. but i give it a C for the quality of the book. yes its a used book but i think they could have selected a better looking book. over all B
4,The content is great.,"I love John Berger. I read his Here is where we meet first and leading to his other books.The condition is not so good, however what he was trying to say in this book is inspiring. It just, the pictures were too small, considering that some sections containing pictures only."
5,The book that changed my life!,Short and sweetThis book set me freeIt can for you tooMore details please feel free to comment <3
3,why do Fox do this,"I have already purchased Snows of Kilimanjaro and The Sun Also Rises. I would really like to add Adventures of a Young Man to my Fox CinemaScope collection but why do they (Fox) force me to pay $44 for the lot. Come on Fox Classics why not release these as singles. Same with Soldier of Fortune and The Tall Men. I wonder if the studios read these messages but if they did they would find out what people want. I am collecting the entire 20th Century Fox CinemaScope collection from 1953 to 1967 and its nice to have them in single discs so they can be placed one year after the other. Waiting for all those other classics to be released like King of the Khyber Rifles, The Rains of Ranchipur, Woman's World, The Cobweb, The Adventures of Hajji Baba and many more. Come on Fox Classics bring 'em on."
4,"Good group of movies,,,not great",The movies here all have a place in my home theater collection. None are up to the quality of the novel portrayed.
5,The Great Fontana,"Needless to say I""m biased since Carl grew up in Monroe! But, I have followed his career (since I was a former disc jockey)and in my opinion he ranks in the top five consisting of Bill Harris,Bobby Knight (also from Monroe),Bill Watrous,and Frank Rosolino. None of the above, except Carl, played ballads like Carl Did. Great album. (wish you had more of Carl's CD's."
4,Product was a shown,This was for our daughter. She loves it. The description of the eagle wasas promised. Pleased with our purchase.
4,Frame,"The frame we received is great, but not the exact item we originally ordered. Also, we understood that the frame order included a rear axle which was not received. We can not complete the construction of the bike without this part and are a bit disappointed at its omission."
2,"""WARNING"" This CD is not worth the cheap price","In my opinion this CD was a total waste of my hard earned money. The music is absolutly horrible! If you are expecting the old doggpound rap and beats you won't find it. The best song is ""we can freak it"". everything else seems thrown together. You would think a rapper who rapped with the best of them (dr.dre,snoop,the legendary tupac,outlaws)would definetly rip a mic in peices. Instead it seems since tupac died kurupt and other rappers feel the need to pretend they want to unite east and west coast. My advice to people who have not bought the CD is find a friend who has it and listen to it before you buy it."
4,Very good stuff,"A quick reading reissue of a taut 1970 Australian book. Two teenage girls are hitchhiking together during the summer and one of them kills a man. Each accuses the other and neither's story can be disproven. It is now four years later and the sister of the victim turns to a very ordinary--and yet odd--man to decipher the issue. The mystery is unraveled in flashbacks, written testimony and current interviews. The reader will be very hard-pressed to finger the culprit properly in this unusual tale."
4,Gray squirrel review,This was a gift for my five year old grandaughter. She loved it because it looked so real and was so soft.
5,nutts nutts nutts,wowo my husband is so into them he loves them and watches them outside wants one as a pet but i got him that and said this will have to do lol and he loved it he collects them to it was a great addition to his collection very durable and soft looks realistic too
3,Cheap Material,The picture makes it look much nicer than it actually is. Material seemed cheap with a plastic sheen and sickly blue gray color. Not as nice as other 'natural' stuffed animals that have more realistic fur. For the price I can't complain. It is still soft and cute and was appreciated by my 3 yr old niece.
5,A must have for Disney fans!!,"This CD is a must have for all fans of Disney. The score is more mature than other Disney scores, and makes for a beautiful listening experience. Every song takes your breath away. This is Alan Menken's best work in my opinion. Stephen Schwartz's lyrics are classics. The music varies from a soft prayer to the lord in ""God Help the Outcasts"", to a song about having a good old time, in ""Topsy Turvy."" Both children and adults will love this soundtrack for different reasons. I strongly recomend this CD, and you will not regret the purchase."
5,Unsung Hero of 90s Disney,"I'm gonna go on a rant here and express my disappointment at how often this film is forgotten when stacked against the other animated Disney films of the nineties. A theme that all of those films shared were tremendous scores, often the work of Alan Menken. I don't know why this film is forgotten, but it has some of the most wonderful music a Disney Film has ever produced, the juxtaposition of the delicate and the mighty is apparent throughout this score and makes for a riveting story. The chorus numbers are powerful and add a lot of strength and intense emotion which is necessary. I am extremely happy with my purchase."
3,"Good, but not great.","In comparison to their brilliant, self titled, debut this album is a bit of a disappointment. The compositions are not as strong and the album is overproduced by Alan Parsons. The musicianship on the debut was also more interesting, dense and challenging. This plays more like orchestral pop than progressive-rock. After this recording Ambrosia went steadily downhill to produce one miserable album after another. This one's not essential...Simon"
5,great,great if u love TLC like me & my girls know. I bought it 4 me but my girls play it more than me.
5,Great Idea Book,"This book was wonderful and easy-to-read! It gave me some great ideas and addresses issues of ""I can't do that in my organization"". It gives you understanding of how to change, step by step."
4,Protect That Sink,Performs well in protecting sink surface. Like the ability to lift one end to put scraps in sink disposal without totally removing. Easier to keep clean than other rubber ones we've owned.
3,9d is 9d,"These shoes are on the narrow side, but no other width is available, guess I will have to suck it up."
3,"Of its type, very good","I bought this book based largely on other reviewers. If you are a someone who really gets into the minutia of family names connected to Burr and Hamilton, this book is for you. The author also makes the assumption (and says so in the introduction) that the reader understands the basic history of the events. The casual reader of history may not make it through this book, getting lost in the detailed connections of various relatives of Burr and Hamilton. There are fascinating revelations and speculations unearthed, making it a decent book."
2,hoses are way too short,"The hoses that connect to hot and cold taps are only about a foot long? Unless your taps come out directly beneath the sink you'll need some kind of extension to install this. If I ever get it installed I'll update my review. Turns out the local DIY stores don't sell an ""extension"" Had to mate 2 hoses and several connectors together but installation is complete. The old feeds on the old faucet were easily twice a long. This is a surprising problem. Unless the distance from you faucet to your hot/cold taps are 10 inches or less I wouldn't buy this. That said it looks nice and it works now. Still only 2 stars for leaving the feeds so short."
4,Easy to install,"Replaced old Hamat faucet. This one was really easy to install, despite very limited space under the sink. I like the simplified mounting. No need for special tool. Faucet looks good and works fine. The spray delivers better pressure than the aerated stream. I like that the flow type stays in the last selected position. Price is reasonable. I was worried about the nylon hose (vs. traditional metal one) but was told by Kohler representative that all Kohler products (even the more expensive one) are built with the nylon hose. Purchased from Amazon and I was pleased with the quick delivery (free, without expedited request)Good product, highly recommended"
4,Great faucett for the price,"I had considered buying a Delta one-touch faucett because it lets you turn on the water to wash your hands without touching the handle--a great feature after handling meat. But the Delta price was hefty, so I kept looking and ended up with the Kohler. Good decision. The Kohler looks nice, cost half the price, and it's so easy to turn on with a gentle push of the wrist that it is virtually a one-touch itself. The flow has been fine and both spray options work as advertised; hose length is also good. My package did come without an O-ring and another ring, so check your package carefully before calling your plumber to install to avoid needing a return visit. I called Kohler and they sent the missing parts, although it did take over a week to get them. Overall, I am happy with the purchase, although I regret not considering the brushed finish over the easily spotted polished chrome."
1,Wildfire Family Entertainment,"I am afraid that this isn't family entertainment. All of the young people are sleeping with each other. They are into drinking, drugs, gambling and sex. Now the ""mafia"" enters the picture.I would love this show if they would take all of this out. There is anough drama in everyday life without going to these lengths.I don't think I'll order season 4."
5,"America's Answer To Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, and ELP.","This amazing debut album by Ambrosia is America's answer to Yes,Genesis, King Crimson, and ELP. The album is a beautiful blend ofprogressive rock, pop, and rock n roll. It was mixed by AlanParsons, and was the first album that Alan worked on outside ofEngland. All of the songs are wonderfully crafted and excellentlyrecorded. Drink Of Water with the incredible pipe organ is a truemasterpiece. Mama Frog, Make Us All Aware, and Time Waits For NoOne are all classic prog rock songs. This is a must have CD to besure."
1,Total FRAUD. Does not work.,"Not only is the seal broken, but the thing just lies there. Beyond a waste of money. Straight out fraud."
4,G.R. DVD,This purchase was for a secret santa request. The DVD arrived in good condition and exactly when the shipper said it would. The recipient was excited about her gift.
3,GrandmaL@MO,"The bouncer is really cute and one that my daughter picked out, so was a nice shower gift. However, the top bar is pretty flimsy and that needs to be improved."
1,Bouncer stopped working,"I was also too happy to find a bouncer that was pink for my baby girl, but after about 2 weeks of using the vibration function, it quit working. I replaced the batteries & even tried smacking it around a few times, but it would barely even quiver. I purchased the fisher price rocker, that's the bouncer that converts into a toddler rocking chair & so far it works well, & my daughter can reach the toys easily & she loves that."
4,Solid.,"'Kiss of Death' is worth the price all by itself.'Rusty Angels' and 'Shaking off the Chains' are also standout tracks. A fine, if inconsistent, offering."
3,Yet another non-Sabbath Sabbath album...with rap guests!,"Like everything after Born Again and before Reunion (except Dehumanizer) this is a ""Black Sabbath"" album in name only. Far from the best of the rotating-lineup years, but not as bad as some think. For six bucks, worth having for the Iommi or Martin fan and for the couple of good songs. What the hell they were thinking with that doofy comic book cover and a rap guy producing, not sure, but the result isn't actually that bad."
1,Worst Sabbath album ever...,"I have every Black Sabbath album, and this one is by far the worst. It's a shocking example of how the mighty Black Sabbath fell. The only good thing about this album is that it did so poorly, it finally paved the way for the original Sabbath reunion. This album is so bad it makes me angry to even see it on the shelf in my CD collection. Maybe the worst major metal band release ever, far worse than Kiss ""Unmasked"", or Metallica's ""St. Anger"". Black Sabbath should offer a cash buyback program and destroy all known copies."
1,Just a shell of it's former self,"I remember when Black Sabbath was cutting edge and daring. When a new album came out, it was a mini-event. But after a series of forgettable albums, the band has lost all of it's edge. When I first heard Forbidden, I thought I was listening to some lame band who was obviously influenced by Sabbath, but didn't have the knack to write the songs. When I found out it really was Black Sabbath, I picked up a copy of the disk to give it another try. Sadly, this is just awful. The Ice-T appearance does not help or hurt this disk, simply because his rap is buried in ""Illusion of Power"", an unlistenable song that does not sound like Black Sabbath. The riffs are repetitive, the drum work is generic and lyrics are awful. The only bright spot on the disk is the tune ""Rusty Angel"" which hints at this bands former greatness, but can't hold a candle to their 70's & 80's material. Only buy this thing if you are a die-hard fan who needs every album."
1,"Awful. horrible, terrible.","I liked the Eternal Idol, loved Headless Cross and didnt mind Tyr. This album is absolutely God Awful!! Buy it only to laugh at. I couldnt rate it a zero because the lowest you can go is 1."
2,Good reading but DIFFICULT to get through,"This book was required as a reading source in Master's program. I found that I would deliberately put it off to the last minute because it was very difficult to get through. There was an extreme amount of technical jargon used wherein I had to re-read various passages to understand the intent. It is an excellent resource of information, but in my opinion, poorly written for the student's ease of learning."
2,Love you:),I liked this book because it tells u that god can answer your prayers. You just need to believe in him.
5,Excellent Book !,"This was the first Judy Blume book I ever read. I was about 12 when I first read it and now I am 34. I have never forgotten this book or Judy Blume, she is great! I have a daughter now and look forward to introducing her to this book as well as many other books by Judy Blume."
3,Some things just SHOULDN'T be sold......,"I was really happy to get the book at the great price I got it for and it came in the mail in record time, but the book was SO old that as my daughter began to read it the whole middle section fell out.Great price, BUT some things just shouldn't be sold if it's going to fall apart less then a week after you get it."
5,A must-read,"I have read this book at very LEAST 20 times. I'm now 11 and bought this at age 9. The title made me a little reluctant... but I read it, and loved it. It wasn't sugar-frosted. It was honest, and portrayed the thoughts of an 11-year-old perfectly. The tale starts on the day New-York one-child family, The Simons, move from their apartment in central New York to a house in the suburbs of New Jersey, where her parents can have all the grass, flowers and soul-food they need. In the midst of unpacking, Margaret meets Nancy Wheeler. Nancy is 11 and well... blunt. She is eager to 'grow' just like Margaret. The story follows Margaret and the other PTS' through their sixth grade year. It is a fabulous novel, and perfect for girls ages 9-12."
5,The book that every girl should read,"The summer going into my 12th year my Aunt gave me some books. As I was an avid reader, I was thrilled.I did not, however, expect to read a book that would change my life.Reading about girls my age going through what I was too embarrassed to talk about was incredible. I saw a little bit of myself in Margaret, Nancy, Gretchen , and Janie.Reading Are you there God... also made me think about different religions, family relationships,and about how I would feel when I got my period. I must have read it fifty times and each time was as great as the time before.Twenty years later I still love this book. And if I ever begin to feel old, I pick it up and I am twelve years old again and it feels wonderful."
3,It was so-so! :),"It was so-so! I wasn't so sure! Parts of it were really for young adults (this whole book was for young adults!) and in parts it was a little gross! I read this book myself and i actually laughed at them in parts because they were pathetic and RIDICULOUS!!! :) This book wasn't that bad though, some parts I really liked, like when Margeret went to church with her friends and to a temple with her grandmother- I liked hearing about that- I am in the 6 grade and I could relate to some parts but all in all the book was in the middle."
5,one of the best,"The first book I read by Judy Blume was OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SHILIA THE GREAT. When I read it Judy Blume became my favorite author. Now I have read most of Judy Blume's books and i think Are You There God It's me Margaret is one of the best. I am like many of Judy Blume's characters in her books for example I am like Margaret because i am in the sixthe grade, I am 12 and I am an only child. I am also like Shilia because I did not think I could swim and I had a swiming teacher named Marty that taught me if I bklew bubbles I coud go under the water and swim."
3,LSMS,"Censorship reveals a shortage of assurance in a community. Yet censorship is in our community today. I think the banning of the book Are You There God, It's Me Margaret , by Judy Blume shows the lack of maturity in today's society. If people don't have enough confidence in themselves to be able to talk about the content of the book, then what has happened to our society? I personally don't think this book along with any other should be banned. We do have freedom of speech in America, so why can't these authors write about these kind of things and share their feelings with the rest of the world? We have the Constitution for a reason and that reason is not for it to be partially followed, but to make sure that everyone has the same and equal rights and completely follow the rights/ laws. So Are You There God, It's Me Margaret, along with any other book should not be banned."
4,Very Good Book!,"I thought this book was very good, because judy blume writes really very well. i am not done with it yet, but i am almost done. I got this book a Barnes & Noble not Amazon, and it is still very good! I recamend it!!!"
4,My review (Courtney),This book was a good book. It was very vivd. I would recommend it to any girl over the age of 12. I liked it very much.
5,U gotta read this!,"This is the best book! I 100% do not agree with the people who gave this book any thing less than 5 stars! If your between the ages of 10-14, you'll love this book"
4,For my grandaughter,"Bought this for my 11 yr.old grandaughter. She loves to read-has a Kindle!-but like most kids her age,she is going through changes with her body, friends, family,etc.This book is a classic and has stood the test of time. Hopefully she will get both enjoyment and wisdom out of it."
4,Wonderful then for girls and wonderful now...,"I read this book as a pre-teen and really enjoyed it. I purchased it for my almost 11 year old daughter with the hopes she would enjoy it too. She did, infact we started something...each one of her friend's parents purchased the book for their daughters'within 2 weeks after she received hers! Now she has the older and newer version.I recommend this book for young girls from ages 10 to 13 and for their moms to read if they haven't already as a young girl.I actually read it again in one day :-)"
3,Margaret Was All Right,"""Margaret"" was an interesting book. It talked about getting your first bra, your first period, and religion. Some of it was silly. I also think the book favored being Jewish. The Jewish grandmother was seen as kind and caring, but the Christian grandparents were seen as annoying and bothersome. Also a lot of the names didn't seem to fit the people being written about. I think the book would have been better if it had been fair to both religions. Anyway, I found it interesting. But I do understand why it was banned in many schools and libraries. While I don't think any book should be banned, I do think there are better books to read. People should decide for themselves."
3,Good Recipes - Lacking Photos,"This book is a really good voyage into the art of cooking in Argentina. The text talking about traditions and the culture in general is very informative and interesting. I bought this product because I read that the book had pictures - I prefer cookbooks that show photos of the recipes - and this book has zero photos of the recipes. I was a little disappointed. Just wanted to make sure that no one else bought the book without knowing this fact. I have tired a few recipes and they are very good, it's just the lack of pictures that bothered me. Happy cooking!"
3,"Ambrosia definitely did a ""180""","This album goes in a different direction than the previous 3. It's much more ""poppy"" and doesn't have the progressive theme the previous albums did. This is probably the best known of Ambrosia's albums because of the few songs that make the Billboard charts, but with anything that makes Billboard, it's mainstream. Unfortunatley, some of the mainstream songs aren't always the best an artist does. If you like a lighter feel, this album is the way to go...if you like the original prog feel, stick to the other albums."
1,Not what it used to be,"This used to be a great product but they changed the formula. The new product is mostly alcohol and contains tocopheryl acetate a synthetic form of vitamin-e that many people have allergic reactions to, among other health risks. Most of the ingredients are not organic."
5,Chimpanzees Don't Wear Pants,"This book is a treasure of wit, a marvel of humor, and a deep and wide view of scientific knowledge interacting with life experiences. Faithful to his patients, yet Dr. Long manages to take us along a trip of social, moral, and medical satire to challenge the imp in any old practitioner, or young physician, or curious intellectual, or green budding future Mark Twain. I read this book from cover to cover, not missing any occasion to laugh or to smile. Seriously!"
3,Was ok,"I thought that there would be more history about the handkerchiefs .. it was ok was disappointed, I wanted a book with more information."
2,ugg,I thought it was so pretty and charming right up to when the clover fell of and was never seen again. It lasted maybe a month. 2 stars because it is pretty.
5,The Best Album I've Ever Heard,This album may have been one of the best written I've ever heard in my life. Excellent guitar work through-out the entire album.
5,"Not Known Band, but Great!","A very awesome, band named Focus is on this compact disc. The disc has their greatist hits, and some of their best songs. If you love very great music BUY THIS CD ! The songs are relaxing, fun, and with a little flute in the end. You have a classical touch with some great guitar, drums, flute, and many other instruments combined to make a very good sound. ENJOY!!!"
2,Disappointing followup to their debut LP,"Trickster's debut LP was pleasing; they played with ELO on their American tour, and their intricate arrangements, catchy riffs, and sense of musical drama made for a record that was consistent and enjoyable. Unfortunately, their followup LP lacked the same energy and stick-to-the-ribs punch. ""Back to Zero"" doesn't have any standout cuts, and the production lacks a certain energy this time around. At its best, the band relies on dynamic riffs to create its musical drama, but this followup album seems a bit limp. Even the production seems basic and unspecial.Trickster was never the most arresting live band, but this studio effort is sorely lacking."
1,HEY GUYS THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION....,"Hey I almost buy this dvd.....but thanks to your reviews i did not, so instead i found a better option....you can buy the cd / dvd The Very Best of Billy Idol: Idolize Yourself (CD/DVD) [Deluxe Edition]Here the quality is INCREDIBLE.....the sound and image is fantastic....!!!! also has more and great videos!!"
4,Stories that reminds you that Xmas is the Perfect time 4 Luv,The stories where all thouching. All of them sweet. These 3 stories are perfect examples of how the holidays are a time to look in the heart and discover what is missing and to fill that void.
2,Very Superficial,Hersh attempts to interpret the Appalachian ballad and comes off as cute and cloying. She does nothing that isn't far surpassed by traditional artists. If you are interested in a skilled modern treatment of this genre try Gillian Welch.
1,try Kossoy Sisters Bowling Green instead...,"Completley agree with a customers reveiw from 1998, as it was pretty much what I was going to say. I was kinda shocked when I read the song listings, the Kossoy sisters pretty much did do the ""original"" of this album in the early 50's...I'm thinking? Bowling Green is worth a look in if you are looking for a more traditional slant on these songs. After sampleing it's just not my cup of tea, so sorry to all who love it, but I won't be adding Herst's attemts to my collection."
3,Extreme Evolution is Overrated,"I've already seen Extreme Evolution and it's not bad, but nothing great. Yeah there is a barbed wire match, but that match was just horrible to watch. I would've rather seen Terry Funk vs. Sabu from 8.9.97 or Sandman vs. Sabu Stairway to Hell on 1.10.98. Those were extreme classics for Extreme Championship Wrestling. Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn from Hardcore Heaven 1999 is too common and shouldn't have been on this tape. The one from Living Dangerously 1999 I preferred. Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka from November To Remember was ok, but why not put the match from White Plains, New York? The tape only gets 3 stars because the matches were too common and really didn't display much uncensoredness, except for the 5 seconds of francine's left breast :)"
3,Disappointing,"I bought the VHS version of Extreme Evolution and I was pretty (although not extremely) disappointed with it. The highlight is the Sandman/Raven barbed wire match, which is brutal, to say the least. Tanaka/Awesome is also worthwhile, if only to see just how much punishment Tanaka is capable of taking, and Jerry Lynn/RVD is full of amazing stuff, but the match would be much better if it were shorter. Saturn's elbow drop from the scaffold is impressive, but not enough to save the boring tag match which it caps off. The tape will have you reaching for the fast forward button in a lot of places, which is a shame, because I know that ECW has better stuff in the vaults than what shows up on Extreme Evolution."
3,Cool,"Cool, excellent musicianship. My fault for not having purchased it a long time ago. However; James Litherland was a far better singer & I love their earlier work so much more!"
3,quite wonderful playing & execrable caterwauling,"The caption above pretty much sums it up. Colosseum were/are a group of wonderful musicians with (probably mainly thanks to Jon Hiseman) a take no prisoners approach to playing the hell out of the music. Occasional over the topness, but easily forgiven because of their enthusiasm and sincerity and the heights they often reach. Mainly excellent original compositions, some intelligently chosen covers. Uno problemo, however. The singer, Chris Farlowe, is just so barely listenably histrionic, over compensating for lack of soulfulness by sounding like a cattle-prodded Pavarotti on meth imitating Al Jolson. (""MaaahaaammEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. . . how III LOOOOOOVVVE YAAA!!!"") The newer Colosseum disc seems to show Mr. Farlowe somewhat more restrained and controlled, but this CD is a true mixed bag. If you've the capability to edit out the vox track, buy this. Otherwise, in hoc signo vinces (or is it in vino veritas?). Cheers."
4,great fun for motorcyclists,"This series gets down to the nitty gritty of a trip through the African continent by two movie stars. It shows, in it's own way, some of the beauty and some of the harshness of that continent. It's funny in places, sad in places, and downright tearful in others. The motorcycle ride aspects are very true to life (having made many myself but all in the US.) Sometimes the movie is even a bit crude, just what life on the road would be!We watched an episode each evening, eagerly awaiting the next day's adventure.Well worth the cost."
3,A fairly comprehensive but sometimes biased study,"This is a fairly comprehnsive book on various styles of Wing Chun,with detailed photographs provided for the forms of some of the styles,the only drawback is that the authors personal bias comes across very strongly at times and his incessant promoting of his version of Wing (T)Chun does get tiresome,a better and more comprehensive (and unbiased)book is ""Complete Wing Chun,The definative guide"" by Robert Chu,Rene Ritchie et all."
3,Pretty good for the price.,"I honestly bought these bearings for the humor value of the name...""What kind of bearings do you use?"" ""CRAP."". That's funny...These are a decent bearing for the low price. Although I haven't splurged much on name brand bearings, I found that you do get what you pay for. I currently have some Bones Super Reds, which aren't too much more, and I find that they seem to be much smoother. The CRAP has held well, but if your looking for a smoother, and longer roll for your wheels, you might need to spend a bit more."
4,A really good album,"This album was very good. All of the tracks were exceptional except for the last two. The last two tracks seemed very out of place with the other songs, but even these songs were not bad. The highlights of this album would be ""Mother Dear"" and ""Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World."" At times, Neil Hannon vocally sounds a little like Gordon Lightfoot, but musically is very unique. I have all of the albums by The Divine Comedy, and this is by far the best."
2,No at Throttle Up,"I'm going to admit I don't own this, but I think it's important for JVC to know WHY I would never buy something like this.I come from the days when stereos were made with wood cabinets and blue fluorescent lights, and had a rich, warm sound, and two tape inputs. This monstrosity is seriously out of place in my decor. I prefer something that sounds good and looks good for a good price. Good sound equipment shouldn't be for high-income audiophiles only. I love music, too.I am shopping to replace the horrible plastic TEAC unit I was given four years ago, but I'd never buy something that looks like the back end of a space shuttle. I tend to be brand loyal, and I've had a wonderful black JVC TV for 5 years now, and a trouble-free black JVC DVD player for three years, but I'm afraid I can't support design like this. I'm looking elsewhere, but at least, if JVC is listening, they now know why they lost a customer this time."
5,A great cookbook by a terrific writer!,"I bought this book, along with Tender, when they were both Cookbooks of the Month on Chowhound. Everything I've made from it is wonderful, from an easy and tasty curry of aubergines a lemon-frosted pistachio cake (using ground pistachios and almonds instead of flour), and a broad bean and dill ""hummus"". I recommend his other book, Tender, as well. It's a cookbook based on what's ripe in his garden throughout the year.The one gripe I have is that his writing is too gushingly precious....everything is ""if only every day could prick the senses..."" and ""It is a warm ochre soup, soothing, yet capable of releasing a slow build-up of heat from its base notes of garlic, chilli and ginger; a bowl of soup that both whips and kisses"" -- I mean, come ON! It's SOUP! Still it has loads of wonderful recipes."
3,British Cooking,"I didn't notice when I bought this book that it was written by a British food writer. Unfortunately, much of his wisdom doesn't apply to cooking in New Orleans. Nice book though ....."
1,Complete Pain,I thought it was a complete pain to have to adjust the radio then adjust the knob on the transmitter. It's very hard to manage while trying to drive so I dont recommend this. I wish I would have just paid a little more money for something better.
1,This Blows!,"I received the product the very next day! The seller was honest and efficient. However, the product itself does not work as well as I thought it would. I do not recommend the product but I do recommend the seller."
1,Read It and Laugh,"Second in the series.Author's home video based on the book is described by a multi-denominational group, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, as ""making extensive use of 'half-truth', faulty generalizations, erroneous interpretations, and sensationalism. It is not reflective of the genuine spirit of the Mormon faith.""Pretty typical of the author's approach to all subject"
2,"Comfy chair, not much support","This rocker is comfortable, but it does not offer much lumbar support. Also, it has a strong chemical smell that takes over a month to wear off. I would be hesitant to recommend this chair."
4,I love this rocker.,I was searching for a rocker like the PotteryBarn Kids has but was not willing to pay the price.I found this one at Babies R Us and loved it.My mother purchased it for me along with the ottoman.It has been so comfortable and wonderful. We have nothad any problems with it. Our baby goes to sleepeach night as we rock him to sleep in it.I thought about buying a foot post for my feet whileI fed the baby in the rocker but it was not necessary.It was plush enough that I did not need that to helpmy back. (The boppy pillow works great with the rocker as well.)I'm sorry the other reviews experienced problems but I did notand I highly recommend this rocker.I only give it 4 stars because I'd rather it had thePottery Barn Kids rocker feet and not the center circlestand underneath- but you can hardly see that.
4,I like to watch the comedy of uncle joe,I used to watch petticoat junction a long time ago as a young guy and like I said I like most of the comedy shows of the 1950's through the 1972 era back when the actors put a good laugh on the show
2,A 4-star book ruined by glaring textual/factual errors.,"I'm a total wrestling fan, been following it since the late 80s explosion, through the early 90s recession, and into it's current media frenzy. This guide gives some great historical information and facts on the subject of wrestling. What ruins it are multiple (almost one per page) errors about relatively simple subjects, like wrestler's names and moves. An extra day of editing, by true blue fans, would have totally made this book worth owning. As it is, I only recommend it for the young and stupid who don't know any better. So basically, if you're a fan of Konnan, David Flair, or WCW in general, this is the book you'll want to worship. For you WWF fans, who know what wrestling is, try reading it yourself, and circle the errors. You'll learn some things, but the constant mistakes just ruin the whole experience."
2,Not very insightful,"I thought this book would be an interesting read about one of my favorite hobbies, but I was mistaken. There is nothing particularly enlightening in here...basically anyone who has ever watched wrestling once or twice will know the majority of information that is given in the book. I mean, I know it is called the ""Idiots"" guide, but I guess I didn't realize that the authors took it so literally. I thought that the biographies of wrestlers past and present would be interesting, but they too were just superficial sketches. I also found a number of factual errors in the book, which took away from its credibility. I like the idea of this book in theory, and it is nice to see a book such as this being sold in the mainstream, but I didn't like the way it actually turned out. Hopefully someone will try a similar concept but do it better."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!! It made me want to become a wrestler!!!!!!!,"This book was the best book I have ever read. I reccomend this book to anyone who is an idiot and loves wrestling as much as I do. The minute that I read it I was doing piledrivers, clotheslines and diamondcutters. You go DDP. This book is testosterone packed adventure into the exciting life of wrestling."
1,This thing sucks,This is the crappiest thing ive seen. it doesnt work at all. not even on the tiniest scrathces.
1,please stay away!,"I have replaced hundreds of batteries and have done much mechanic work on my personal vehicles so I know how to hook up an inverter. I hooked it up for my son to use on a car ride. This was only the second time using this!Yes it was hooked up correctly (black to black, red to red) It went pop and put out a bad electrical smell before I even hooked up my sons video game. I did not buy it on amazon but it was new from another giant online retail site. I cannot believe that I paid over 50 bucks for this piece of filth! I never saved my warranty card so am probably out of my money. OOOh! I hate getting screwed by such bad quality.I had to share this because I do not want others getting this crap nor do I want Amazon (who I love) to be stuck selling the garbage. Sorry if this review is harsh, but the truth hurts, especially after reading others who got the same shaft.ThanksBen"
3,Limited Use but does it well,"I really like wizards and magic users so I really wanted to love this book. If you want something off the beaten track of magic, this provides some ideas. As an aid to most games, though, it doesn't provide much. It's a niche product for those looking for variants in magic."
3,Not as good a book as I expected from this excellent author.,"I am a HUGE fan of Faith Javane's book on Numerology (Numerology and the Divine Triangle.) I ordered this book expecting it to be of the same sort of work, and was disappointed. Mind you, it's so esoteric in some parts that I don't even understand it, so I cannot comment on it completely.The book starts out with a discussion of various-pointed stars, from seven through twelve. She gets very mystical, and surprisingly, religious (Divine Triangle contains no such slant.) The second half of the book dives into very complicated, ""Esoteric Astrology"" and ""Pentacle Analysis"". It's all way beyond me, and not what I expected (it would have been nice to have had some editorial info on this book!)This would be a great book for fans of Javane who are also students of astrology, but if you purchase it expecting it to have information about numerology (as her other books do), you'll be disappointed."
1,too much talking,"I got this because the music in this show is wonderful and sexy. I thought they'd just extract the songs and put them together, but they also included some of the dialogue from the show. Actually, it's kind of a depressing album."
1,lonely teardrops not here,"If you're looking for Michael MacDonald's ""Lonely Teardrops,"" it' ain't on here. Buy ""Live At The Beacon."" It's on there."

1,awful.,"I have to use this book for a college class. I feel like I'm reading more about the names of people who stated something, and the years and books they did it in more than actual written text from the authors. It additionally refers to a lot of material that, judging from their in-sentence referencing, is out of date. This is one of the worst books I have ever had to use for a college class."
2,"""A Wonderful Nightmare""","Ambitious but disappointing 1957 adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel - marred by overlength, censorship and fatal miscasting. In his penultimate screen role, an aging Tyrone Power comes across as a total stiff. Making matters worse, the Production Code toned down the lustful passion of Ava Gardner's Lady Brett. Even screenwriter Peter Viertel was dissatisfied with the final result. Worth a look for Leo Tover's CinemaScope locations and Errol Flynn's splendid ""comeback"" performance as the alcoholic Mike Campbell."
3,an upchuck of aftermath,"Hollywood has some aging stars trying to recapture the emotional conflicts of their youth. In addition to bullfighting, this movie has one woman trying to find a suitable mate, several men who are writers in unsatisfactory times, and mostly some nightlife in which a fight breaks out amid the dancing, drinking, and smoking. The major character in the movie keeps providing money. Errol Flynn plays a character whose bankruptcy was gradual and then sudden, likely to keep moving to someplace where he still has credit. Hemingway's book, The Sun Also Rises, was about younger people, but only the bullfighter seems young in the movie. If Hemingway had been writing for the Bible, there would be more about Hosea and Samson."
4,A Chick Flick,"I liked this movie quite a bit. I'm a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and that's part of what attracted me to this movie. For me this movie was like Sex and the City without the sex. SJP, narrates most of the movie along with a few other people in her life. I wasn't sure about the film until I was an hour through the movie, and for me the things that happened in the plot were my reasons for liking it not the actors. I feel like anyone who likes Sex and the City or Bridget Jones' Diary (and the way is was self narrated by the character) would enjoy this movie."
1,I Don't Know How She Does It,I have seen many Sarah Jessica Parker movies. I'm her fan. I adore her in Sex and the City; but this is the worst movie I ever seen her. It's boring.
1,Speed metal? lmmfgdao. God damned n00bs.,"Like the gogo's on speed metal?Lmao... The gogo's and the damones are both catagorized as pop punk... Which is pitiful.. If you want speed metal.. Try Slayer, older Children of Bodom or Shadows Fall."
4,What a change - Jack just plays...,"No singing on this album. The entire album is filled with what Jack does best: wail on his trumpet. Excellent combo performances, from soulful ballads to jazzy uptempo tunes. Jack is at the top of his game on this album. Jerry Dodgion assists on alto, along with Barry Harris on piano, Rufus Reid on bass, and Ben Riley on drums. 13 tracks and over 63 minutes of super mainstream jazz. Play on, Mr. Sheldon!"
3,Incomplete :(,I bought a few of the mp3s off the album and I realized the song 'Everybody wants to be a cat' is incomplete. The piano cat who sings 'Fortune cookie always wrong' is cut out (which may be due to it seeming racist?) but so is Duchess' part in the song. I'm sad.
5,FANTASTIC READ FOR ANY TRAVELER TO THE RAINFOREST,Tropical Nature was recommended by my travel agent when I booked my trip to Costa Rica. At times I found the text a bit too scientific for the average reader - but I did find the chapters extremely interesting and learned a great deal more about the vegetation/wildlife of Costa Rica than my nature guides were able to provide.
4,Disney dance mix,I am a dance teacher and am constantly looking for new music that is a little different. This CD fits that description. It is a bit funky and carries a good beat to dance to throughout.
4,Beautifully Meditative Music,"Another wonderful album in the same vein as the soundtrack from the Esalen Massage video. If you liked that one, you won't be disappointed, or suprised. Wonderful music to perform meditative massage to."
1,Small Queen Duvet Cover,"The description for this gives no indication of the actual measurements of the Queen duvet. The size shows as Queen, but upon receipt the size of the Queen shows on the package as Full/Queen, so it's a small Queen size of 86"" x 86"". While that's technically Queen size, it's the smallest size considered a Queen, and far too small for my Queen down comforter. Had I known it was a Full/Queen I wouldn't have purchased it. That said, it is soft and the fabric is very thin, so if you're looking for something that protects without adding much weight, this works well. If I could change the number of stars I gave this product at first, I would change it to three or four, but apparently that's not possible."
3,Color varies,"This is a super price for the duvet cover. however the color is sea-foam green, not white. I returned it and was quickly refunded."
1,Impossible to Repair,"When we built a new house 5 years ago we purchased three of these dispensers. The first broke almost immediately, with the plastic snapping off inside the dispenser head. The supplier said the only choice was to buy a new one. At well over $100 this seemed a bit much, but we did. Now, five years later, another dispenser head has just broken off like the first one. Same place. This time we will be buying a less expensive dispenser. Very disappointing for German engineering."
4,Pretty good,"The shower rod made it in one piece despite awful packaging. My only compliant is the mountings are plastic and somewhat flimsy. Having said that, they still look like chrome once installed - no issues with the look of it. I was lucky enough to hit a stud so the rod installed firmly. In plain old sheetrock, installation might be an issue."
2,where is the bottle???,"Sure, the sling is nice, but where is the bottle? I never received the stainless steel water bottle."
4,Exellent Improvement Quality Tool,"This is a great book, helps on understan perfectly one of the bes Quality tools, DOE.Buy itRogelio Garcia"
1,Complete Waste of my Money,"After opening the programs the words ""insert CD"" blink over and over. It was very difficult to navigate through the program. I couldn't figure out how to enter mp3s into the program.After reading the confusing manual I tried to get my mp3 files in it, but it couldn't recognize almost all of them. The ones it did, wouldn't play, and it said""error initializing microsoft directXplease re-install directX or contact the technical support""so, from the CD, I tried to reinstall directX and got this message:""Directx setup has determined the a newer version of DirectX is already installed. No installation was necessary""leaving this program useless. No tech support. Don't buy this."
1,Bad Product,This product does not do what I purchased it for. It is completely useless to me now. It does not take the lyrics out of the songs as it advertises.
4,Very good but ...,I like this pot a lot.It does the job greatly and such a pot should be considered for buying by any serious tea drinker.The only drawback is that it does not isolate the hot water very well which results in a loss of temperature from its walls.During winter this does not matter at all given the fact that we heat our home anyway but during summer it causes the opposite effect which results in overconsumption of electricity (it heats the kitchen & I cool it down with my A/C).Great product anyway ...
4,Human Playback Glitchy At Times,"For the price, the product is very good; however, the main reason I bought it was due to its Human Playback feature, which for the most part works very well but occasionally ""wobbles"" or makes ""static""-like noises. The HP.dll file was updated in the Finale 2005 product, but this update-file is not compatible with PrintMusic! 2004. I'm still awaiting word from customer support regarding any possible HP.dll updates for PrintMusic! 2004."
4,Pretty Good Software,"Using other opinions, I decided to purchase this software. I had never used music notation software before, but this is really easy to use. It has a lot of good features. Sometimes it can be confusing, but that's solvable by reading the helpful manual. I am very impressed with this software."
1,Product Activation!,This software is a demo. This is shareware and doesn't print anything unless you connect to the Internet. You can only activate it twice. Product activation is wrong. Save your 75$ and download the Demo for free.
1,Maybe they send the items but at the wrong place,Ill never trust again on this seller. In fact I already erase my billing data from amazon.
5,"Made to Crave: Satisfying your Deepest Desire with God, Not Food",I have read this book in record time for me. I was already starting to try to eat healthier and this book just cinched it for me!!! I am now on my journey with Jesus to learn the fine art of self-discipline for the purpose of holiness!!!
5,Amazing!!!!!!! Five stars!!!!,This was a life changing book. I have always struggled with my weight and have often searched for a book that made sense to me. God used Lysa to speak to me ! To help me be honest with myself and God. I'm so grateful for this book!
3,"Helpful, light hearted, tough","I liked the Biblical worldview, the message that we are made to crave God, but that we fill our cravings with things that can never fill us (food...etc).Didn't like the ""man-made"" rules that come across, like a highly restricted diet and excercise for weight loss (though the latter is good for overall health, of course).I didn't lose weight after this book, though it was a stepping stone. Another book that's helped (besides the Bible) is ""Rise Above"" by Gwen Shamblin. It is less restrictive overall and has been another tool that has been helping to free me from bondage to food and calorie counting and guilt-based exercise!*Since writing this review I read more of "" Rise Above"" and felt a lot of condemnation from Shamblin if you disagree with her. She comes across a little bit like she is more enlightened than the rest of we mortals.Bottom line, both books are tools, but Christ is the answer, healer, the One who wants us to be free."
2,"Short, easy-to-read chapters, good biblical tidbits","A good book overall. Very easy to read, and there are some great, useful tidbits. The book pretty much stays on a single theme and doesn't explore other facets of craving/idolatry beyond food. A good read, but a pretty limited. You will struggle to relate if you don't suffer with a pretty serious addiction to food."
5,Thank you,Life changing!!!! This book has changed my entire mind set toward food and living for GOD. Thank you! Thank you!!
5,Great discs,"This is the only Dual Layer disc that my duplication tower will use. I tried Ritek before and had a miserable failure rate but these Verbatims work like a charm, only had 1 disc fail verification out of 200 burned."
5,Now thats what I call tooth paste,"So strong that is like anti-septic mouthwash the first time you use it. Even though it doesn't talk about it, I used it for about two weeks and a co-worker asked if I had been whitening my teeth! Long lasting freshness, can't wait to try other Marvis flavors!"
5,great product,"well made, tight fit, comfortable!!!! exceeds all expectation, now we'll see how long they last. will let you know later."
1,Poor quality,"These gloves split a seam--one on the back of the hand, near the thumb--the second time I used them. And, no, I don't have fat hands: The gloves fit well, they just weren't made well."
4,Leathercraft Handyman gloves,This was another gift that was a hit.They were really some cool looking gloves and felt nice too. Nice gift.
3,Have Potentials but ....,This cat J-Shin has potentials to really shine in the music world the problem with these c.d there are only a few songs on this album that will really grab your attention and let you see the potentials that he has .. While the rest of the material on here is 2 nd rate sound like material that has already been done.. Perhaps better songwriters and top notch producers could deliver a better album next time around .. But there are a few songs people should take notice onOne Night Stand( Feat LaTocha Scott) that 's my cut right thereSleepin With FriendsWhatever U WantIf you want to check the rest out.. Check it out at your own risk
1,Looks nothing like the picture,"Bought this as a gift for my mother who has dark maple cabinets (same color as the board shown in the picture). When it arrived, it was 10 shades lighter and looks nothing like the picture. It is more the color of bamboo. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Picture is very Misleading!!!"
4,Just A Littttllllleee Dissapointed.,"Now don't get me wrong, this watch does its job, it works fine as a simple analog watch and its water proof. BUT I was a little bit dissapointed with the size of the watch.While I did not want a bulky fat ass watch on my wrist I did want a decent size so it wouldn't be mistaken for a girls watch. This particular watch is right in between the sizes for a mens watch and a girls watch. I don't know but this watch seemed a little too feminine. It was my fault for not guessing the dimensions of the watch a bit more accurately but I guess I expected too much. But for under $10 this watch is a pretty good buy, just don't be too surprised if looks a small on your wrist."
3,Casio Men's MQ24-7E Classic Analog Watch,"It's a nice watch, yet a bit cheaply made. It's sold for a good price and serves it's purpose. The coloring is nice and the watchband is able to make comfortable adjustments."
3,"Great watch, but BEWARE OF BATTERY LIFE","I had this watch for a few months and then the battery died so I was like, no problem, I'll just buy it again since it's so cheap. The 2nd watch came in and the battery died within FOUR DAYS. It was ridiculous. I absolutely love the watch and I give it 5 stars because it's so simple, stylish, and thin... but don't trust the batteries. These watches must just be sitting in a warehouse somewhere, ticking away.I put new batteries in both watches and now I don't know what to do with the extra one."
3,It's all right,I find the watch all right. It looks bigger on the screen but the size is all right. It's classy. I think this is the kind of watch people will look at twice on your wrist. It doesn't look cheap at all. It pikes curiosity.
3,40 dollars for 25 minutes?,"Way over priced compared to other dvd'sMahjongg for BeginnersThis dvd might as well have been put on youtube, considering the length."
2,Kinda Okay,"I got this dvd awhile ago to help me and my wife better understand the game. We hope to join local tournaments.PROS: Susie seemed knowledgeable, and she is.CONS: 40 BUCKS FOR A 25 MINUTE DVD!!!!! Susie does not go much into gameplay.We highly recommendMahjongg for BeginnersIts longer and cheaper and goes more into detail on gameplay and tactics. Did I mention 20 bucks cheaper and longer! The host is very knowledgeable and I learned alot and my wife agree's and we are ready to tackle some tournaments!!!"
1,Was I even reading the same book?......I totally disagree.,"This has to be the lamest book I've read in a very long time. I thought the premise sounded great, but it was put into an empty story. I wanted to care about the characters, but they had little depth. I almost stopped reading it all together when at least some action started up, but that only led to a very dissapointing ending. There was no real workup to a climax. It got to a certian point of the story when it just threw all the characters in the same room and ended it. Maybe Jonnie Jacobs was getting bored with it too and wanted to get it over with. Do yourself a favor....skip this one."
1,boring,This guy's a horrible writer. The other reviews must be from people he's locked up in his basement.
1,"Hey Amazon, add a negative stars category for this!","On the TV show, there were so many good songs introduced between ""Songs in the Key of Springfield"" and this crappy ""Yellow"" album. I agree with everyone that there should have been a ""Songs II."" If the corporate jerks wanted to make money off original songs, they should have just made an album of Homer singing songs. The ""Bartman"" days are long gone (THANK GOODNESS). I never watched the show during the first season, because I found Bart to be annoying. The ""Sing the Blues"" CD was awful. It was ""so 1991"" as one of the characters said about the ""Bartman"" song. Fortunately, the show has improved a lot over the years, with the focus on Homer. Homer is what keeps the fans coming back year after year. I would have loved to have had a copy of Homer singing ""The Garbage Man"" song. Let's hope a new CD of songs from the episodes will arrive soon!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,"I agree with the other reviewer who's waiting for ""Songs in the Key of Springfield: II"". ""Songs"" is a great album replete with Matt Groening's and Alf Clausen's touch--biting, sarcastic, witty, and libertarian--like the series (and no wonder, since the songs are taken directly from it); ""Yellow"" and the blues CD are terrible--they sell only because they carry the Simpsons name. Spend your money on ""Songs in the Key of Springfield"" instead."
1,What is this?,Is this a Simpsons cd or just a bunch of lame songs that are sung by the characters? The lyrics are not funny and the music seems like it is from the 80's. What happened to the stupidity of Homer or the sarcasm of Bart? In this cd you get a bunch of weird songs that barely have anything to do with the show. Stay away from this like the plague. Instead buy Songs in the Key of Springfield for a bunch of laughs.
3,"Gimmicks, but NO Story line",I really have mixed feelings with this movie. I watched it in HQFS 3D and I thought the effects were really cool! This has to be the most random 3D movie I have ever seen! It goes from teddy bears flying off a conveyer belt to some fat guy in a lake watching TV! There was one scene which I thought was cool! It was a man fencing sticking the sword out of the screen! I don't know if I should recommend this or not! Oh well!
4,Fake,"A boy loves his dog but also blames everything on Jake the dog. A cute story with a little bit of pay back. An excellent story for a young child. Perhaps a gentle ""Peter And The Wolf""?"
2,ok,Required reading for a college course. Probably would not have read it otherwise. Not the most interesting read.
4,Dorothy: Powers To The People,Thank you for the speedy delivery of the book. It came in great condition.
1,Very disappointing,"As advertised, it appeared dark in color and no color options were offered. Upon delivery, I was shocked to find WHITE ! It is not the soft material we are used to but a hard plastic with wide deep grooves which make you very careful plaing glassware on it. It comes with snap-on feet though I don't know why. If you place the feet against the sink rim, water goes everyshere EXCEPT the sink. Now you have to balance the feet on the rim of the sink so it will drain properly. Designed by someone who never washed a dish in his life !"
5,Perfect bling for my granddaughter ...,"Since peridot is her birthstone (August), I bought these earrings for my granddaughter's Sweet Sixteen. They're small and suitable for her. She loves them.The quality is good, and buying them from Amazon certainly beat fighting the crowds at the Mall. (Don't get me wrong; I love shopping malls, too. Those are fun, ""girly"" outings ... when I have plenty of time and am with a few friends.)"
5,An excellent part of the teach yourself in 21 days series.,"My experience in internet-programming was a bit of HTML and a bit of JavaScript. This book taught me everything I needed to know about creating dynamic web-pages, and how to link my web-pages to relational databases. If you have a bit of programming background and want to build your own web-database, this is the book to buy!"
4,Very Interesting,"I'm 18 and my favorite music is classic rock... I've always listened to the well known bands like... Led Zeppelin, The Who, Black sabbath.... the list goes on. A friend of mine asked me if I knew about Uriah Heep.. I told him that I had never heard of them. So he gave me their greatest hits cd. I was really shocked on how good the music was. I would consider myself a Uriah Heep listener, though not enough to be a true fan."
5,fabulous screenroom,"I put this screen room at our camp that we go to every weekend or so. I always wonder if it will still be up when I get there. It always is. It has not even come close to blowing over, apart, or have any damage from wind or rain. I am amazed. The zipper is still working great as well. You will not be disappointed if you buy this screen house."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Unfortunately, I misunderstood when I purchased this and didn't realize that it wasn't the original artists. That was my fault, though it certainly isn't obvious. Some of the songs are okay, but MANY of them are AWFUL!I gave it two stars instead of one only because 100 songs for $5.99 is a pretty good deal. But buy this with your eyes wide open. Don't be fooled."
4,Good Basics,"This book is excellent for people who have clinical experience and would like to delve more deeply into the physical world of MRI. The explanations are simple, yet still effective without obscuring the underlying physics. Basic relationships between fundamental quantities that govern image formation/quality are also made clear. However, this book is not for advanced MR students looking for theoretical formulations."
2,I could have spent $4 on better sunglasses!,"WORST SUNGLASSES I'VE EVER BOUGHT IN MY LIFE.1. They are very flimsy.2. PLASTIC lenses.3. The color on lenses is much lighter than the picture shown online.4. Too light.Seriously, don't waste your money!"
2,Where's Moby and Fat Boy Slim?,"Come on people! Don't tell me Moby and Fatboy Slim were out of your price range to include them on this album. The Moby and Fatboy Slim songs took the energy to a new level in this film, and they don't even make the cut for the soundtrack? Don't waste your money...just wait for the next Missy Elliot and LL Cool J albums to come out...and buy ""Play"" and ""You've Come a Long Way Baby""."
1,Not the original recordings,"Very disappointing, and a waste of money. I usually check for ""original recording"" -- NOT just ""original artists"" -- but I missed it this time, to my regret. If you remember the original releases, skip this collection."
1,I own and its re-do's for sure,"You know, if it was spelled out what you're getting, then its still buyer beware, but this is planet earth and its a screw everyone you can world (but don't tell them of course).Just got screwed again. Then we all ask why so many hate!Madacy of Canada does it again."
4,"Too little, too late !","What would have happened,if we did not know much about The Roman Empire ?That is unfortunatly what Greek culture has prevented the world ,to know about the persian Empire !While, The cultural contribution The Greeks have offered the world, is undeniable....yet, 2500 years ago, they were just small city states,who as far as global imporatnce, were too small and insignificant........yet, thier advantage in recording history has influenced the currant intelectual circles,far more than thier true comparetive historical value .....Persian History , has been consistantly marginalized by the western historians....perhaps with a little mixture of twenteith century racism.The issue is not that "" The Winners of wars "" will get to write histroy.....The real issue is that "" woners of means of documetation ,and writing "" ,"" will get to change history "".This Book, is just a start to balance the western vision of History........"
5,Love It!,My daughter loves this book. There are a variety of stories and a glossary in the back of the book so you know how to pronounce the spanish words. It's a great book.
4,very cute!,"I really love this stroller. It's very cute and girly! The only thing that I don't like is that it's hard to fold down. IT takes me forever!, I'm not strong at all and it requires a lot of strength. Other than that it's great! I love the high handle bars and that the stroller does not look cheap like a lot of hte other ones out there!"
2,"A nice piece of history, though not what you expect","It's nice to own the ""original"" soundtrack recordings from this film. Years ago when I purchased these recordings, I was torn as to which to select--the original or the digital re-recordings. I bought both. The digitals sound so much better to the casual classical listener (which I am). However, as a Philadelphia-area native, I'm proud of the legacy of Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. This is the same ""Leopold"" made even more famous by Bugs Bunny's impersonation in Warner Brothers' 1949 ""Long Haired Hare.""The originals don't sound very good compared to the digital re-makes. If faced with the choice again, I'd go for the 1982 version of the recordings. They're the ones with the burgundy covers pictured on the front page of this product's Amazon listing. Unfortunately, Disney no longer offers these for sale. I'll just have to dig into my archives to find these recordings and give them another listen."
2,Remastered?,I went to see Fantasia in 1940 and the music was wonderful; the product that I received was a poor reproduction of the original. You should warn your buyers as to the quality of the reproduction; this one is bad. Nostalgia is the only thing that could make it salable.
3,"Classic soundtrack, rotten sound.","I would have no hesitations whatsoever in giving this wonderful soundtrack a 5-Star rating, but the sound quality (Rather, bad sound quality) is holding me back.Now, I'm not a CD snob who complains about minor pops and cracks that may appear in the music I listen to, but I can't honestly think that this soundtrack was remastered in any way. The strings are whiny, the horns are, as someone else mentioned, tinny, and the overall sound is nearly unbearable. I've listened to it on three different stereos and the result is always the same.I understand we're talking about recordings from over sixty years ago, but surely Disney, with all their millions, could afford to give this soundtrack the proper remastering it deserves and bring the full, vibrant sound of the music to the forefront once again."
1,Original release much better sound,I own the original 2 disc set. I thought the re-master would be an improvement. The sound quality on the original is noticeably better than the re-master. One of the worst soundtracks of any CD I've owned since the 80s. I returned it. Don't buy this disc...it sucks. Real bad.
5,Excellent soundtrack.,This is the soundtrack recorded in 1982 for the reissue of that year of the film. It was recorded in stereo with a great orchestra and has a fantastic sound. I think the blu-ray edition of the film should have this audio as an optional track to match the HQ of the film restoration that is amazing.
5,Classical Music-Disney Style,"I've always loved classical music, but now my kids appreciate too. My kids like to act out the music especially the Sorcerer's Apprentice. The quality of the discs were excellent and I received it in a very timely fashion."
5,This is worth the read!!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite books in the series! Once I got started, I couldnt put it down. I did think though, that Amy's method for curing Spirit was a little unrealistic...I'm not going to spoil it by telling, but that's why I rated it four stars. I think it's an awsome book though, read it!"
5,The best,This book is the best! there are lots of things happening in this book like Lues wedding. Its a really good book and you won't wan't to miss it!
3,Nice but a little thick.,"This wallet has a zippered cash section that you do not see in the photos. The zipper is quite thick - I cut mine out which greatly reduced its bulk. The leather is soft and very nice quality. The removeable card holder is great for those times when you just need a license and credit card for ""just in case""."
2,Simplistic,"This might be useful for someone who has very little experience in writing and needs to be spoon-fed some basics. It is not at all useful to someone who has even a moderate level of writing experience. If it wasn't a Kindle version, my copy would be going to the Salvation Army with my next donation."
3,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"Following all of the wonderful reviews here, I bought ""One Hundred Ways"", hoping it would contain some tools of the trade, so to speak, to improve my writing.If you are looking to improve your grammar and sentance structure, or make your writing look more polished, this book will be great for you. I, however, was hoping for tips on how to make my dialog sound more natural (dialog being one of my weakest points in writing), or maybe how to keep the tension going in a story, just for a few examples.If I could give this three and a half stars I would, because there are several common-sense writing ""rules"" listed in this book that people seem to forget. Overall, though, I wasn't as impressed with the book as I'd hoped I would be."
3,100 Ways to Improve Your Writing (Mentor),"Overall, this is a good book worth the money. If you are looking for quick-and-easy tips to improve your rudimentary writing, it's a good choice. If you are looking to improve the dimension of your writing, this book will disappoint you."
4,Handy little inspirational reference,"This is a lighthearted, yet useful little book. It has plenty of very useful suggestions and tips on improving your writing, as well as manifold examples and exercise.Definitely worth picking up a copy."
2,Warning,"The reason for me not liking this book is partly my fault. I was under the impression that CS Lewis wrote this book. I got over that pretty quick, but found this book frustrating, still. There are snipets of CS Lewis writings, but then they abruptly end and don't really have a poper lead up. The author decides to give you his own opinion on everything. They have two dramatically different writing styles, so going from one to the other was very choppy and really not that enjoyable. But, this book would be good if you just want a light overview of Lewis' arguments."
5,A very effective mask!,"This mask has to be seen as pictures can't capture the awesomeness. It captures attention, yet doesn't appear intimidating. It's a mask that provides great fun. Quality and fit is great. Comfort might be an issue for some, but hasn't been an issue for us."
5,"a very good source book, well written","needs some updating, but, nevertheless, an excellent authoritative, well written, reference book for any library re country house architecture in Ireland."
4,Great movie but.....I hope you know german.,"I saw this movie only once, as a child more than 25 years ago, and loved it. The actors are good, the script is great and it kept me on my toes. I was not bothered by the lack of menu and scenes typical of almost all DVDs. I was bothered by the lack of subtitles as to make it more real, the actors speak in english and german. Warner Bros could have taken care of this a long time ago :("
5,Classic wartime movie,I first saw this movie in college in about 1976 and was completely bowled over by the movie. I found a copy of it on VHS a few years ago and remembered why it had impacted me. The movie seems to recreate the feel of an occupied country and Anton Diffring portrays Heydrich with a quiet deadliness that is chilling. The final scenes in the church are absolutely stunning. A fabulous movie that will intrigue and entrance you
5,Authentic as the first edition!,"So interesting to read about aerobics at a time when no one ever heard of aerobics or knew anything about it.Dr. Cooper makes a very convincing case for this healthy activity which has since swept the country - and the world.Our sedentary lifestyles have been bad for us for a very long time. At the time of this writing, many people had no idea how much CONTROL they had over their own health (and aging!). Or how easy it could be to make a measurable change in their lives.Many, many books followed Cooper's very first one. This book will give you a great perspective on the 'what's all the fuss about?' of the time."
2,Does have defects,As most who bought this one knows the battery door did indeed break on my sons. It skips and freezes really bad. He still uses it but I do not think it would hurt his feelings if it got stolen at school! lol
4,Very pleased,I am very pleased with this product. My finance gets migraines quiet frequently so I bought this because it helped me and it is helping him.
1,Broken,It never got a dial tone! I don't know who to ship it back to or how to get my money back (that is the least important...I just want one that works).
1,Sorry guys but you can't like this CD!,"If you say you like this CD it means you've not heard much Italian music. I'm Italian, I'm not a great fan of Italian music, but this Cd is the Italian equivalent of the Spice Girls, music for 14 year old kids. What surprises me is that some of the people who rate this CD 5 stars also reviewed music by the Nomadi, Vasco Rossi, Carmen Consoli. It's like comparing Kilye Minogue with the Rolling Stones! Vasco Rossi has made some beautiful music, Carmen Consoli is one of the greatest Italian musicians of all times, Lucio Battisti is probably the best Italian songwriter of all times, but MAx Pezzali (the person behind 883) is just somebody who should write jingles for TV commercials! Try to listen to the names I mentioned, and then come back and tell me if you still like 883. Ciao"
3,trombone treats,"This CD has some top music on it and is worth a listen. Unfortunately I have some slight problem will live recordings, I consider that the recording quality is somewhat lesser compared to those recorded in a studio, and the applause detracts from the listening quality. I should have considered this when I ordered it but too late."
1,misnamed misleading,"this is not a book on *SYSTEMS* architecture.Like that book on Enterprise (SIC) architecture that was all about LANs and not the entire enterprise , this book has too narrow a viewpoint.The title should be changed so it is not misleading. The author's perspective may be *his* system but to most of us this stuff is at best a subsystem, or merely a component, or otehr lower level item.if you want to know about SYSTEMS architecture the key book is rechtin and maier. there may be a recent handbook of SA that covers a number of topics but eb and mark have the only real systems architecture book that I have verified.this book is not the book the title claims."
4,Great bone,Our dog loves this bone and would eat it in one sitting. We let her eat half of it at a time. The only downside to this bone is that it does not last very long
1,My dog wouldn't touch this,I can't necessarily blame the product but my dog sniffed this and wouldn't even pick it up. Looks like I'll be donating the other box I bought to his dog friends in the hopes that they will eat it.
1,"Yes, it is edible but healthy??","Seriously?? By whose standards??Since when are wheat starch, glycerin, cellulose, potato starch, bacon flavor (?what does this mean?) healthy?I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.I love the nylabone chew products but I don't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats."
5,Very comforting.......do not fear death,Reassuring to know that we will reconnect with those who have gone before. The examples are heartwarming and make it easy to understand the afterlife
4,Great little power supply!,"This is a great little power supply for the money. I would recommend it to anyone. I used this in a client's computer & although it didn't fit perfectly, with a little metal tweaking, it went in fine. (A proprietary junk supply came out.)"
1,"This one's no good, but there's a better choice!","I absolutely agree with the guy from Michigan, but if you want the B-sides, get Things We Do For Love, a cheap but rich in B-sides compilation (available from Amazon). It doesn't have all the B-sides, but what it has is great. And if you still can find the British compilation 100cc on vinyl, the B-side is all unknown tracks."
2,"Cool bike, but NOT without problems.","The bike is decent.Pros:*Cool design, and color.Cons:*The front brake was totally misaligned rubbing on the wheel. I had to adjust, and doesn't seem right still, but it's not rubbing tire.*Unless you've worked on bikes in depth, you prob. won't figure out how to put this thing together by their manual. I had to take to local bike shop*Training wheels don't hold well at all, left side keeps coming lose and I have to tighten with wrench.*The bike comes banged up , I guess from shipping. Lots of scuffs, looks like a used bike, but haven't noticed any structural damage, just cosmetic.- Do yourself a favor, and visit your local bike shop, I would if had to do again. Never buying another bike online again."
3,Cool Bike But Heavy For Beginner Riders Not Using Training Wheels,"We got this for our just turned five year old who had just graduated from training wheels and needed a bigger bike. The bike itself is sturdy and looks cool but it is ridiculously heavy. Our son tipped over and fell from the weight of the bike the first few times he tried and then wouldn't try it again for a few months. He's not a tiny kid, is 55lbs and pretty tough but the bike is a beast. After much practice, he is now able to ride it but isn't so great at starting and stopping since the bike is so heavy to hold up when you're maneuvering. I went out and bought him a cheap Walmart replacement bike today and he was able to start and stop with little practice so this bike will be put away until he's a little older. I would definitely recommend the bike for kids who use the training wheels or for kids who are already skilled in riding, it just didn't work out for our kid."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"It works, I'll give it that.The coaster brake causes so much drag on the hub that my five-year old has difficulty pedaling.The bike is sturdy - too sturdy. It's too bulky and heavy to control well or get started without a push. The tires are so fat and soft they actually interfere with steering.Like I wrote in the title: you get what you pay for. Spend the extra money - get a real bike at a real bike shop. It will make a real difference in your child's riding experience."
1,Extremely heavy,"Our 6 years old, who is tall and well built, fell in love with those bike when we were browsing Amazon for bikes. He loved the color. The price seemed a bit high, but given the brand, we were all waiting excitedly for the bikes to arrive. Great disappointment for me: I am appalled by how heavy those bikes are, compared to bikes our son's friends have, which are not less sturdy. I should have paid closer attention to the shipping weight: 45.8 pounds !!!! I did not weigh the bike, but its probably around 30 pounds, or about half of our son's weight! He is still mastering the art of bike riding, and falling with these bikes is painful due to their heft - lots of iron for little kid's bike. Fortunately, he is not really aware of those issues, and loves the color."
3,Schwinn Scorcher,This bike was damaged in shipping by UPS. The front reflector was broken and the fork was bent so that I could not install the front tire. Otherwise the bike looked good and appeared to be well built. I tried but was unable to straighten the front fork so it must have been subjected to some extreme abuse by UPS. On the positive side Amazon was as usual great about the return and refund. Three stars because of the shipping damage.
5,Completely Satisfied,This item was exactly what I was looking for. Their website had pictures that allowed me to be sure that I was getting what I wanted. Good quality and was shipped on time and actually received earlier than promised.
1,Classic Owens Band in Great Form,A terrific example of Buck's style and a lot of his best Tunes but get the version of the concert on the Sundazed label.
1,D for dumb,"I demand more accountability on the part of manufacturers and their affiliates. It is shoddy workmanship to put out a product that partially works sometimes, this one needs work and I do now appreciate buying something to find that I am the guinea pig consumer the product is being tested on. Get the software and device functioning consistently and correctly all the time and I can then give a great recommendation. Failed is not praiseworthy. One star means D for a grade."
1,homophobic claptrap,The usual right-wing propoganda arguing from preconceived notions of what marriage must mean within a narrow cultural context.
3,"Looks great, doesn't feel so great.","This is an adorable shoe, but the strap makes it a bit uncomfortable."
4,"A 6th Grader Reviews ""From Pearl Harbor to Okinawa""","I liked this book because it's the first book I ever read about the war between the U.S. and Japan. It had a lot of good information and the pictures at the beginning of the book captured the key points of the war. Even though it was factual, it was never boring."
5,Love the feel,In my opinion the best feeling grip available. Only draw back is that it is longer than the original grip and now the gun will not fit in the original plastic case.
4,A must for a Clinical Engineers repertoire,"Chapters on Management and Supervision(7) and Development and Operation of a Clinical Engineering Department(8)are the most useful ones. Contain excellent pictorials, graphics and flowcharts especially for initiating programs in a new set up or revamping a dormant one. Chapters 3 & 4 on Technology Management and Technology Assessment and Acquisition respectively are a good reference for the fundamental concepts of the role of Clinical Engineering in Healthcare."
5,great follow up album,"this album is a great follow up album to seasick. its a little darker than seasick, but still has those slow catchy songs you love like beauty and seven."
1,This album is rubbish!,"Irritating, transparent euro-trash from england's second best mediocre band (oasis being the winner of that sad trophy). If you absolutely must listen to Blur at least never listen to anything beyond Leisure. Bollocks to the rest!"
5,Eclectic Compilation by sixties Sex-kittens,"There is a wide variety of material here,from blaring,campy commercials and radio spots to pop classics (Sandie Shaw,Nancy Sinatra) to riot-endusing ""vocals"" (Donna Loren,Linda Thorson,Barbara Feldon) The perverse,playful and sheer cool & strange are all represented here in a 60's cocktail for the cool collector.A bonafide guilty pleasure, for sure."
2,Mediocre at best,Superfluous writing with many editing errors...content seems good but hard to sort through given the style it's written in. Expensive book. Would not recommend. Only bought it for a class. Our other textbook: 'Consultation in Early Childhood Settings' is a much better read/more helpful and much less expensive if your area of consultation is regarding children.
5,Doesn't add HP,"This K&N; oil filter works. It doesn't add HP like their intake does, so if you're looking for HP gain move along.I'm sure that welded on nut would help the weak, but if you're a real man you can just grab the whole filter and twist it off."
1,wrong filter,I orderesd 6 filters for my 2010 Ford Transit Connect.When i went to have my oil changed it was the wrong frilter.
1,Hits of the 70s,"This claims the songs are by the original artists. BIG FAT LIE, The songs are NOT the original artists! Buyers be warned these are not the songs you listened to on the radio. I feel deceived by this false information & I wish I'd known this fact before I purchased this useless set. I'm very irritated that I wasted my hard earned money on this piece of crap and if I could have rated it at a zero I would have..."
5,Really a multipurpose item.,"Although this is named a microwave cart we purchased it as a TV table for a large conventional TV. It fits our need perfectly. I'm a long way from being a handyman, but with a little help from my wife we got it together with few reruns.I like question 4 below. Am I over 13? How about 74?"
2,Coaster -microwave cart,The cart was sent with no directions and the parts were scattered all over theinside of the box.Very poor presentation of a product. Very disappointed.Microwave Cart in White / Natural - Coaster
4,it covers all the types that stayed behind,"I've always wondered how I would have reacted had I lived in Germany in the 1930s. As a Jew, as a Lutheran, as a man or a woman, as an intellectual, as a peasant, as a business owner. The author does a fair job covering the members of the art world, artists, dealers, museum directors, critics. He picks one or two of the worst in each group and also a few shaded lighter grey. The only fact I would question is the name of the main Jewish bookdealer in Munich. Wasn't it Emil Hirsch rather than Heinrik Hirsch? Also it's slightly annoying to see some people's birth and death dates in brackets but not all and even more annoying to see a birth date and a questionmark for the death date. Did his editor not get around to filling in the dates?"
5,Good oil filter.,"I use this filter on all my vehicles, and it works remarkable. It is truly a HIGH PERFORMANCE oil filter that works well."
3,Okay,Doesn't sound much like a pheasant .....more like a crow.. guess I will have to keep looking ... .. ..
5,2nd Half of Review Below is Missing,"A good book -- one of the finest of the Icelandic sagas. Still the review below doesn't do it justice since only half of what I wrote is shown. Amazon.com had indicated they would add the second half (which was inadvertently cut off in the original submission and which I ended up re-writing for inclusion @ their suggestion). Unfortunately, though I did the re-write (& communicated about it w/them numerous times) the inclusion was never made. As a result the review below continues in its truncated & misleading form. But don't be put off by the fact that it seems to stop in the middle. The saga, itself, does not but goes on to a powerful & compelling end, which makes this one of the great pieces of world literature -- although it is little recognized as such. -- Stuart W. Mirsky"
2,Some of the images actually looked a bit sinister,"On a particularly stressful day I ordered this and Echos of Maui, immediately disappointed by both and then got RELAX WITH NATURE WATERFALL and found what I was seeking...enchanting relaxing interest that soothed and delighted me."
3,"IF IT LEAKS, TIP IT FORWARD","ok, i just want to say that i own this AC unit, and it's alright. it's nothing exceptional, and i probably would never buy it again.i live in boston, and it gets ridiculously humid. it started leaking, but then my bf and i tipped it forward and the leaking stopped.good luck."
5,Exquisite interpretations,"This album was released at a time when Cohen was almost forgotten, about seven years before the tribute albums I'm Your Fan and Tower Of Song would spur renewed interest in his oeuvre. Warnes' interpretations are always graceful and moving. She understands Cohen's music well, having done backing vocals on some of his albums like Various Positions, and she covers his songs with loving dedication. My favorites include Aint No Cure For Love (from Cohen's I'm Your Man), Coming Back To You (from Various Positions), Came So Far For Beauty (from Recent Songs) and of course the formidable Joan Of Arc where Cohen himself sings some of the verses. Her voice is the perfect vehicle for his poetic lyrics of romantic longing and despair, and my only complaint is that I would have loved to hear her interpretations of Suzanne and Sisters Of Mercy too."
3,Not Her Best,"Nobody can interpret Cohen's songs like Cohen. Not even someone with the depth and range and sensuality of Jennifer Warnes. I suggest you buy Cohen by Cohen (get The Future or Leonard Cohen Live) and instead of this album, pick up a copy of The Hunter by Jennifer Warnes. If you want to hear this girl sing, and ...can she sing, then get some of her music, not this disc where she is interpreting songs that don't really work for her. Listen, for instance, to Way Down Deep on The Hunter...Jennifer at her best and the whole album is one you can just get lost in. Also a very good technical recording with low, low notes that will find the absolute bottom of your stereo loudspeakers abilities."
1,What a cheesball video!,"This video would have been great if not for the cheesy editing, crummy instruction and lame music. What a total waste of money. I recommned that this be filed under ""Worst Salsa Video Ever""!"
1,Giant capsules,"I'm currently taking fenugreek and wanted to add this to the mix to see if it helped my supply. I couldn't swallow more than one. These pills are pretty large and not just that- the texture of the capsule makes them get stuck in the back of my throat every time, making me gag and spit it out. I've tried with water, juice, milk, etc...nothing works. Wish I could return this but it's obviously already opened. What a big waste of money! If you have any problems swallowing large pills, I recommend you to skip this product completely."
5,Milk,"It works! I had an abundant milk supply as soon as I started taking these, on the very first day!"
4,"Self absorbed, but good info too","Maybe it isn't fair of me to say this, but it seemed pretty clear to me, while reading this book, that its author was a fairly self-absorbed person before her illness, and remained so during and after. It was hard for me to read, at times, because of this.However, there is some extremely valuable information here, especially in the book's constant reminders that many who cannot communicate in the usual ways are fully aware and have feelings, often strong ones. Some sensitivity is in order in any such situation, and I expect to retain that lesson for years to come.There is also some good information about Guillain-Barre, which I did not know anything at all about prior to reading the book."
5,"WiFler, portable base station","Hi,Just wanted to tell you how nice your WiFlyer is working. Using Apple G4 12"" 867 laptop with OS 10.3.6.Installation took about five minutes and it's been working great.Thanks for a good product.Tom Boland"
