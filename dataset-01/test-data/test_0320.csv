3,Works well but...,"I like this bar. It does it's job, seems sturdy, easy to use, but...it's leaving black scuffs on my nice white Specialized Expedition bike. What is my recourse? I need to transport my bike but I don't want the scuffs."
5,Robust and functional,"This bar is very stout and capable of staying in place. I use it to mount two expensive Treks and feel confident the bikes will stay in place at 70mph on highway. When I picked up my new Treks, the service tech commented on the quality of the bar and asked who makes it, where I got it etc...he was impresssed of it's quality. The rubber end coatings interface well and won't harm bikes' finishes. Both my treks have different frame configurations, the bar adjusted easily."
4,Good for the money,It works well but I had to wrap the galvanized pin with electrical tape to keep it from scuffing up the neck under the handlebars. Beware the spring tension. It's pretty strong and caught my wife by surprise and gave her a nice little blood blister. Good buy considering how much the higher end ones cost.
4,Works as advertised,"Bought this to transport my wifes cruiser bike to the bike trail. It works just like the ad says it will, but it is a bit sloppy on the fit around the neck or the frame by the handle bars. To compensate for this I use a bungie cord around the bike neck and the carrier, just in case. It is quick and easy to install and serves a need well."
4,tension bar for bicycle,"Hey, for the price its fine, does its job, makes women's bike sit on the bike rack better. Works as good as the more expensive tension bars. Should come with a warning to be very careful putting it on the bike, if it pinches (make that bite!!!), it will hurt. Otherwise, for the price you can't go wrong."
4,"solid value, quickly delivered","as advertised, it greatly eases mounting for drop frame style bikes on a standard bike rack."
5,Great book!,"Intellectual and inspirational too. Packed with info on great authors I was unfamiliar with, like Fr. Knox. Now I want to get one of his books!"
3,Global: Warming?? Cooling??,"This book is a well researched exposition of the fact accepted by most governments and scientists in the 1970s: the earth is cooling rapidly and we are entering the next periodic ice age. It's a lot more scientific than Al Gore's work. Principally, it will make you realize that our so-called scientists, supported by government research grants, will predict whatever will make them the most money. (Then it was cooling; now it's warming). Draw your own conclusions."
5,A modern Prince Hamlet,"Elric is the tragedy of a generous and torn soul brought to evil by the cruelty and shallowness of his peers. He would have loved to be a gentle,kind and caring ruler: but the envy, and the vile spite of Yyrkon drove him to evil. I've loved the scene when Elric,saved from merciless drowning,is against seen by a baffled Yyrkon who believed him dead. I've laughed at Yyrkon's despair.Here I am, feeble and weak, but having a right to live and love as any other. The revenge of the evolutionally challenged. Elric was generous, pardoned Yyrkon to his ruin. Stormbringer is a clear symbol of the desire of power and revenge who possess many men,and all the history of Elric is a parable on free will and man's capability to determine its own fate. Besides, Elric's stories are a wonderfully and somberly decadent masterpiece of modern fantasy. I've loved it!"
2,Sailin da South ESG,"We purchased this cd ""New"". However when we opened it, we noticed it looked like it was a burned cd. Definately not the quality we thought we were getting. We were farely disappointed."
3,Why do we have to go all the way to Paris?,"I thought the story was at its best when it played it straight. The description of the helicopter ride to Landing Zone Bravo; particularly the faceless, firing, door gunners and ""spent shell casings rolling into piles as the Chinook banked and maneuvered down..."" were best examples of powerful and thought provoking words.I wish the author would have remained in factual, insightful places like these rather than divert me on a fanciful trip to Paris. However; I would still recommend the book for its flashes of brilliance."
1,Not satisfied,The book I received was brown as if it had been lying around for 20 years. I'm not sure I will even read it.
4,A New Perspective On War,"""For just as happines is more than the absence of sadness, so is peace infinitely more than the absence of war."" This quote from Tim O'Brien's Going After Cacciato represents the basic theme of the book. O'Brien uses a strange man named Paul Berlin to illustrate the realities and illusions of the Vietnam war. Through Berlin's imaginative trek to Paris he presents views for and against the war. Although the characters and plot are not real, the book leaves a disturbingly realistic impression of war. The book flows like a person's thoughts, through imagination and real events to bring a complete picture of the psychological effects of Vietnam. At times this gets confusing but overall the effect is new and different. This is not just about war either. The themes of non-conformity and finding inner peace could be applied to many aspects of life. And most of all O'Brien shows that although Berlin leaves the war, it is not absent from his life because he has not yet found peace."
1,What is this book really about?,"I found this book to be almost boring and unrealistic in its portrayal of Vietnam. I changed my mind several times regarding what this book was about. My interpretation was quite different from any of the others I read and I won't go into it because it would give too much away. My final opinion was ""who cares""."
4,One of the best British comedians,Bean is timelessLook and see for yourselfHis Christmas shopping trip was and is the most original skit you will see
3,Borla Cat-Back,"Great product, easy to install, good fit and deep throaty sound, but don't expect additional gas mileage or power."
3,Old Ideas Rehashed,"The myths of Fallen Angels appearing on Earth from Heaven is older than the Biblical accounts of them.Nothing much new to the subject is presented here. Archaeological evidence for the existence of such creatures has been known (yet officially unaccepted) by science for well over two hundred years. A rating of three stars was given to this work because of the suffocating reliance on biblical books as points of historical fact. And, foreshadowing Andrew Collins' later work; THE GODS OF EDEN, speculation runs rampid and assumption becomes fact.However, If nothing else, on the more positive side, this book is a good read if your are a Biblical scholar and believer."
5,Great read,Probably the best book I have read on this subject. Well documented and concise. I have a soft cover from years ago and bought the kindle edition so I can reference it anywhere.
3,A Slight Disappointment,"In the massive information database we have today, there is really too much conjecture.I found this book satisfying in that it delivers on one promise: it brings out information about the ancient past that opens up questions. I found it less than satisfying in that it does little to amplify on what is otherwise available. Although I would recommend the book as a curiosity, I find it difficult to recommend for serious students of ancient cultures."
1,Horrible.,This is a horribly researched and error filled book. The author misinterprets the Biblical texts constantly; through a lack of understanding Biblical Hebrew and Hebraic thought. This book had inspired me to right Collins' many wrongs and do my own research on the sons of God and the Nephilim which is published as Biblical Origins: An Adopted Legacy.
4,"Looking good, even if they're not biting....","Just as with Ben Hogan's famous Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf, understanding the ""mechanics"" does not always mean you'll shoot lower scores. (I'm a testament to that!)And by reading this book, doesn't mean you'll catch fish. What it does do however, is give you the confidence, and style, in your cast to make fly-fishing both more enjoyable, and fun. Whether it's golf or fishing, style points count and that's what ""Master the Cast"" did for me. Follow the drills and cast with confidence! If you own a fly rod, you need this book"
3,Cats did not like flavor,"We're having hairball problems, since we have adopted a long-haired cat. A previous cat of ours liked malt falvoring, but our three cats turn up their noses at this brand."
2,Catchy title incoherent content,"I picked up this book as title looked very interesting. I read a good part of the book in travel. The book does a fairly in-depth objective analysis of a few specific case studies (eg Rushdie affair in UK, Hijab issue in France and Nation of Islam/Louis Frakhan coverage). However, these are but random samplings of events which got a lot of media coverage but do a poor job of reflecting the overall Muslim presence in the West. Not an easy read and not as objective as I hoped."
3,Great price average receiver,"It has worked well. The sound is good but not blaring if you crank it. I paid $150 so I am not complaining about the product, just the design. To turn on the subwoofer you must hit a button on the remote and then a button on the receiver. Why not just one button? To switch from DTS to 5.1 DD to stereo is just as ridiculous. Product is good but the design engineers must be reprimanded for not making it user friendly."
3,don't necessarily believe that 1 star guy...,"well...he says that no subwoofer would work on his receiver, even when trying out other subwoofers from bestbuy. chances are, he just forgot to change the settings on the dvd player itself. YES, the dvd player settings MUST also be set to have a subwoofer output, as well as changing the settings on the receiver. i myself have not tried this product but do own many aiwa products that have dependably supported my listening needs. try it out for yourself and see if it really is a defect. chances are, that guy just overlooked one of the things he had to do to get the system working."
2,"Stereotypical, cliched high school football story","Whoever wrote this must have watched every high school football movie ever made and stolen plot element right and left. There is nothing, repeat, nothing in the way of an original plot element in this movie. Becuase it has a sort of luke-warm Christian theme, 25 Christian fundamentalists have given it enthusiastic 5-star reviews, which is absolutely typical for Christian-themed movies and inflates their average ratings in a very misleading ways. This film is mildly entertaining, but it's just not great cinema."
3,Disapppointing for Ms. Heller,"Jane Heller is by far my favorite author and I've read everything she's written. I have been waiting for about 7 months for this book to come out just to get my next dose of Jane Heller, but I was a little disappointed by it. It is your typical humorous, happy ending sort of book (which is why I love them so much), but Melanie, the main character, isn't very likeable. While she seems career-driven and successful, I don't believe she was realistic.No doubt that I will await the next Heller book and I do not regret spending the time reading 'An Ex to Grind,' but it seemed a little under par for her normal work."
3,Page turner... but I HATED the ending,"I absolutely loved reading this book. I though that Heller did a great job at addressing modern day gender equality issues that people (mostly women) often ignore. I couldn't put this book down! But I hated the ending. One of those ambiguous, up to you to decide type endings... :-/"
2,"Annoying, self-centered main character","Melanie Banks, a Manhattan financial planner had been married to Dan Swain, a former New York Giants football player. He supported Melanie through Business School, and sent many big name players her way as she was getting started. He was injured and that was the end of his career. Melanie would not listen or understand why Dan would not get a job. She left him and moved into a place known as the ""Heartbreak Hotel"". Melanie becomes obsessed with Dan's spending habits. Determined to stop paying Dan alimony, she concocts with the help of her friends an improbable plan to find Dan a love interest. Dan falls in love with Leah Purcell. Melanie fails to see how much Evan, another resident in her building, is interested in her. Naturally, things turn out for the best, or do they? The ending leaves you hanging. Normally I'm a big fan of Jane Heller, but this was a weak effort."
4,Versatile and different,"I really like wearing this bracelet. I did, somehow, think that I was getting a real bone bracelet, but even so I have enjoyed the bracelet very much. It is comfortable to wear, and it goes with so many outfits."
3,Okay,"I have had these seat covers for well over a year now... I love the color and the soft velour like feel of them.I don't love the way they seem to attrack fuzz and hair. It is very difficult to remove..After taking our cat to the vet, the seats seem to always have hair on them, no matter how much I clean them.They have held up somewhat well, with minor rips.All in all, they seem to be prettier then they are functional."
1,Didn't receive what I paid for from Dak Mart,"I ordered this unit from Amazon, which was then fulfilled by DakMart. I ordered and paid for a new unit, but was sent a different, substandard used unit from DakMart. It wasn't the same model, didn't have the three Denon speakers (came with 2 Mission speakers?), had no DVD feature..... a dismal substitute. I tried to contact DakMart -- no one answers the phone, the automated operator answers - there is never a live operator on duty to route the calls, I left messages and e-mails to employees within the company.... no response. I suspect a ""bait and switch"" has occurred. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH DAKMART."
4,Gets my hair clean - not sure about other benefits,I got this stuff because my wife decided that this would help my thinning hair. The folks who buzz my hair every few weeks said it is very good shampoo. Thus to make my wife happy I replaced my organic shampoo with this stuff.It gets my hair clean. I'm not sure about any other benefits.We got the chemically treated formula so my wife can use it too. My understanding is that I should perhaps have a different formula for optimal results.
1,Watered down,I ordered this product from a seller on Amazon (Khanh Hoang Mai) to only find out that it was either watered down or mixed with another solution. I say this because I bought the same exact product from Smart Styles in Walmart and it was very strong and creamy and now my hair has shine and body since purchasing from Smart Styles.
5,Great as usual,"This is a great product...as usual. I don't really have a problem with hair loss, but I hate all the hair that falls out around the house, in my bed, down the drain...etc. This actually helps with that...A LOT. Great deal too...it is at least twice as much if you buy it at the local salon or beauty supply store!"
2,Not family friendly...,"I bought the book thinking I could create wonderful desserts for my family, with more frequency than I currently do. To my disappointment, most of the recipes contain one or more alcoholic ingredients, which usually are not cooked off. No wonder the author loves her desserts, they give her a buzz! I can't serve these to my kids. I found the book a bit too ""lush""ous for me."
5,Fabulous,"Their no other band like Maze and Frankie. I always enjoy their music on radio and the tape made me feel as if I was, front row again, at one of their many concerts I took in."
5,Who gobbed?,"This live album from the late seventies, showcases these old men of Punk at their best. I bought this album first in the early eighties and played it to death. It and SLF's Hanx are probably the best live albums I've ever heard.There's only one of their expected hit songs (Grip) on this record which is refreshing for a live album (which usually are only greatest hits albums). The songs which are here show the stranglers at their darkest and most menacing best. The mellower stranglers are good but not as good as their darker side. So if you're in a bad mood and want to vent some anger put this on, it works everytime for me."
4,Brought back memories of my first gig - Stranglers in 1980,"While I was too young to catch them back in 77/78 I did get to see The Stranglers at my first concert in 1980 and they still had some of this edge and aggression going on. There were even still mohicaned punks in the audience! This recording catches the excitement and energy of those early days, if not the musical prowess... but its a little timepiece as far as I am concerned. It shows the band at the height of their fame and influence on the music scene doing numbers from Rattus Norvegicus, No More Heroes and even some from Black and White. If you were there in those days... buy it and remember. If you werent, buy it to hear what you missed."
3,A Non-nuclear Defense of W.Europe in the 1970s.,"I initially bought this book because of its authorship by knowledgeable World War II military veterans: U.S. Colonel Yale, U.S. General I.D. White, and the German General Hasso von Manteuffel. When the book was published in 1971, the main Allied defense of Western Europe was to stop the Warsaw Pack (communist) armies before they invaded into ""West Germany"" (or Fed. Republic of Germany), by threatening to use nuclear weapons against the Red Menace hoardes. [Manteuffel (being a German resident and survivor of WWII) would not want to see his beloved Germany become a nuclear-radiation fall-out zone; then, who wouldn't?] These three combat-hardened and battle-tested Europe-theater WWII warriors wrote how the Allied Powers could use Blitzkrieg-like tank armies and manouvers to either keep the Warsaw Pack's Red Army from invading W. Germany during the Cold War period or repulse them before popping off defensive and self-destructive nuclear weaponry."
2,"packaging 5 stars, CD one star","I love these mini LPs from Japan. I also love the Count Basie Band. But our friends from Japan messed this one up, and it is among the worst of this series. First, the original Roulette label used for the CD face is the orange and yellow edition, which is NOT the original red, yellow, blue & green bars over white label. Second, the sound is not the beautifully restored sounds you will get from the Mosiac Records box set. Instead, it is an older master which was used on the 1987-1988 Vogue releases from France. The biggest mistake is the the first two and a half beats of the song RAT RACE are MISSING! Hopefully (but I doubt it will happen) the Japanese company will re-release the ENTIRE line of Basie Roulette recordings (and Maynard too, please!) and get it right the second time around."
3,Incorrect dimensions in product description!,"I cannot speak to the quality of this gasket kit because I was unable to use it. The product description says the gasket is 10"" in length and 3.5"" in height, which is exactly what I needed for my water heater. Unfortunately, when I received the item it was an inch too tall and a few inches too short (I think I measured it to be 4.5"" tall and 7.5"" long). I was able to return without any problems and I notified Amazon of the listing, so hopefully it will be updated with the correct dimensions soon. In the meantime, if you need a 10"" x 3.5"" gasket, do not buy this product.I was able to contact the manufacturer of my water heater directly for the replacement part. It was more expensive, but still a small price to pay for getting my hot water back without having to replacing the entire unit."
4,"Beautifully filmed, and full of interesting information","Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict-- Shark Reef / The Sacred Island is a two episode DVD set from the series Saving the Ocean with Carl Safina. Safina is a marine biologist (""renowned,"" according to the back of the disc case), who journeys to different corners of the planet researching the latest in general ocean health.This is solid show, beautifully filmed, and full of interesting information. Carl Safina is an interesting host and he obviously has a deep and abiding passion for the subject matter. His presentation is straightforward and he adeptly transmits his enthusiasm for marine biology. If you have any interest in ocean related shows, check this out. It's well done.The DVD is lean. Shows look slick in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen, the 2.0 stereo mix is standard-issue, and no extras.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
5,Tremendously entertaining !!,"Having been a fan of Glen Campbell's for many years, I naturally bought this DVD. Believe me when I say that I was not disappointed. This show that was originally aired by PBS is outstanding. His renditions of his many hits are right on especially Wichita Lineman, Galveston and Rhinestone Cowboy but I was also impressed by some songs that people may not associate with him. His performance of "" The 1812 Overture is unbelievable, especially when he puts the guitar on his head and plays a portion of the song that way. Also, Classical Gas which was written by Mason Williams is done expertly by Glen. And, the show closes with my personal favorite song by Glen, "" Try a Little Kindness "", which is done extremely well. The Souix Falls Orchestra playing behind him also adds so much to the experience. I recommend this heartily to all of you who are Campbell fans and to those who are fans of great guitar playing as well. You will not be disappointed !!"
3,didn't fit,it didn't fit mine or my husband's steering wheel. a Mazda 6 and Volvo s40. so we gave it to his grandfather because it isn't worth it to return it.
1,Stinky wheel cover,The smell of this thing is horrific. It stank for weeks after I installed it. Also the package says that it contains lead and after handling you need to wash your hands. It seems silly that a steering wheel cover would have this warning. I threw it away. Total waste of money!
1,L E A D,"I returned product...Warning on package states that it contains lead that has been known to cause cancer, wash hands after touching. R they kidding...this is a steering wheel cover all you do is TOUCH it!!!! Do not Buy this !!!!!!Mine went right into the garbage.........."
1,Conversation Piece?,I battled stretching this on my Dodge Ram 15.5 inch steering wheel for twenty minutes. When it was almost on the seam ripped apart. I now look at foam inards at the bottom of my steering wheel. I guess all I got was a conversation piece for my passengers.
5,Eye-opening research into the events of 9/11,"Ruppert has conducted a thorough, professional investigation into the events of 9/11, showing that the explanations that we were given by the White House simply don't hold water. In the heat of the moment, most of us were so shocked that we did not examine what we saw in an objective manner. Ruppert sets out the picture clearly. It can only be good for North America as a whole -- and the world situation -- to read this uncompromising investigation into 9/11."
1,don't waste your money,"If you are looking for a book about peak oil and the associated economic problems don't buy this book. Its all about the standard conspiracy theories we have been hearing about for the last 40 years and is so poorly written, lengthy and disorganized that its not worth reading. Is there a rating less than 1 star?"
2,Conspiracy theorists book,"This is a book designed to appeal to conspiracy theorists, of the kind that believe the Fed Reserve and Intl Semetics are controlling the world, aka ""The Creature from Jekyl Island"". Richard Hoffstedler talked about the impulse in America to get paranoid in political matters.BTW I have not read this book but, like the publisher said, that shouldn't stop me from posting. Usually I'm spot on with just judging a book by its cover. Not always, but usually. Thanks."
5,Changed the way I look at the world,This book is most interesting book that I have read. I have referenced it many times after finishing it. I learned so much on how the world works today. Wow.
3,Ok. Not the best,The Cd played fine but not the best Sunny Ade has. This is one of beginning music so it is quite expected
3,More about Bede,"Cavil's book ANGLO-SAXON CHRISTIANITY is a tantalizing title and promises a new or resurrected field in the history of the early middle ages in England. I rated it as a 3 because the information in is good, but it does not offer much in anything distinctly Anglo-Saxon. He does well in acknowledging her Celtic roots in the north and Roman in the south. What he fails to mention is the Eastern influence on the Celts, thus drawing a couple of wrong conclusions about Anglo-Saxon soteriology and anthropology. The bulk of the book seems to be an interplay with aspects of the Venerable Bede's History of the English Peoples. Here he does a wonderful job, but the focus in my opinion is more on Bede as an historian of that period. For this reason, I believe the book is good to have in one's library. But for something more detailed and interactive with more sources and their interpretation it would be better to look elsewhere."
4,Successful!,"I needed something Christian to keep my 1 year old daughter occupied while I worked, and this DVD has worked like a charm. She sits through the whole thing. She loves it when we sing the songs back to her when on a long drive or even when she's just generally cranky. Basically, the DVD has served the purpose for which it was chosen. We are very happy with the purchase. We recently bought another collection in the Cedarmont series that has 100 songs in it. Waiting to try it out."
2,Short and Unhelpful,This is not Carmy's best work. It's an OK essay but doesn't really provide any answers. He should be distributing for free on his website rather than sellling this stuff. This is not a bargain on a per page basis.
2,Boring Made-For-TV Movie,"The only thing that made this film worthwhile is Rick Schroder's nude skinnydipping scene. He undresses in front of the lake, revealing his impressive ass, and then another great ass shot as he surfaces, the water running over his round, wholesome cheeks. This is the only reason I gave the film 2 stars, other than that it's a boring waste of time. You're better off reading James Michner's book."
2,no limit is getting wack!,"this cd is the turn in no limits music, before beats by the pound, mostly all tracks were bumpin, but this cd had 5 good songs, because some where put on before being produced on by the pound. if u want real music, get ghettos are tryin 2 kill me and true"
3,Homophonic Play,"I scream, ""Man!"" cuz dat be da bomb, da paragon of animals and quintessence of dust, a bare, poor forked creature. And when da Masta P he create a mass o' peas, for true! U finish dis revue..."
2,Florida Rails,This DVD was ok for the beginner. It covered only the major line and left out the small working systems and it only touched base on a couple of railfan roads. This DVD seemed very amateurish and not well thoughtout.
1,The Dumb Bunnies,"This book is horrible-- what is sue telling little children that it is alright to say ""Dumb"" ""Duh"".Like when the bunny wanted to drive off the cliff the father said no that it was dangerous then in fact let the baby bunny drive off the cliff and the father bunny praised the baby. In fact I wanted to have this book Banned from the elementary library. Yes I have a sense of humor but this book is so far off base for a young age group that it must be in another planet What kind of example is sue setting for our children??? The baby bunny loved the girl so much that he flushed her down the toilet.THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE FUNNY?? WHERE IS THE HUMOR IN THAT?"
4,Embarrassed to admit to laughing out loud,"Ever pick up one of ""those"" books, where the humor is so basal, the puns and inside jokes so primitive, you find yourself almost barking with laughter, in spite of yourself? This is one of ""those"" books, I'm afraid. The library patrons were met with my sheepish glances after I gave it a cursory preview as bedtime reading for my 5-year-old. The youngster picks his nose, the sight gags are awful, and the father bunny gets to wear the coolest underwear, just like it should be in real life. An excellent introduction to a hilarious series of books. Hats off to Denim and Pilkey!"
3,Salem Story Has Never Been So Boring,"I love to read a lot about Witchcraft and about Salem trials as well, however, this book isn't what I expected it to be..It is VERY hard to read, boring, and disorganized.There are a lot of great books about the Salem trials, I recommend you to skip this one.."
2,"Okay, but not as good as Atlantis","It's a notable effort from James Newton Howard, but on first listening, it seems curiously flat. Yes, it's adventure music, and yes, there's some soft flute pieces, but it's nowhere near as inspired, nor does it have as much original, flowing majesty as his Atlantis score. There's none of the 'grab your attention' passages as there were with the tracks 'The Secret Swim' and 'The Crystal Chamber' on the Atlantis soundtrack. In fact, the electric guitar and 'UFO sound' right out of a 50's sci-movie in parts seem jarring against the orchestra, and I'm almost sure that the primary theme is part of an old English drinking song.It just sounds rushed, to me. It misses, it doesn't have the elegance, grace and mystery of either his Atlantis or Sixth Sense soundtracks."
5,a place for my thoughts,"After a LONG search for that perfect journal, I have found one. This journal is beautiful. The cover is hard, and it is wired, so it is easy to write on anywhere. The one downside is that the pages are lined. If that troubles you, find a different journal. But I thought I couldn't have one with lined pages, and now I do and have found that I really like having the lines there. I have never been able to keep a journal regularly before this one and I think that has to do with how much I love it."
4,Remixed classics,"The song selection in this compilation is excellent, unfortunately the recordings have been ""remixed"" to include percussion (via electronic keyboard) that was not in the originals. While this is probably acceptable for someone unfamiliar with the material, for dedicated fans it's an unwelcome distraction. The CD covers well-known tracks from the group's best years (late 50s and early 60s) and a few from the late 60s."
5,Fabulous Pheebs!,"""My thighs were at it again.""Laura Jensen Walker's debut novel came out of the gate running. Phoebe Grant is a refreshingly ""plump"" heroine without the Hollywood hair, but with Christian values instead. An obsessive movie buff, Phoebe endeared herself to me with her all-too-familiar thighs, foot-in-the-mouth disease, and her dream of seeing her name in print. The girdle scene ALONE is worth buying this book, ladies! Laura had me laughing so hard I was afraid I'd wake the neighbors!Recently named Best Contemporary Fiction Book of the Year by the American Christian Fiction Writers, ""Dreaming in Black and White"" is a must-read for the single, Christian 30-something as well as any young woman needing a good laugh and a heart-lift. Can't wait to see what happens in ""Dreaming in Technicolor!"""
1,Another Big Disappointment from Todd,"Well, I like Todd Rundgren as well as the next feller, but this warmed-over leavins doesn't add much to my appreciation for Todd or the Nazz, which in it's day was a truly mind-bending band, touring all over the US of A and UK, and bringing together the stellar talents of massive chopster drummmeister Thom Mooney, who went on to play with just about everybody including John Hiatt, Roger McGuinn, and Rita Coolidge, as well as Disney dropout Carson, Plumber Stewkey...you get the idea; these guys had a great band, and the best of that is distilled into Nazz and Nazz Nazz; number three is flabby and this one is just pitiful, with distortion, weak out-takes, and songs that didn't make the cut. Do yourselves a favor and go for numbers one and two, you can't go wrong!"
3,At first I was excited...,I was really excited when I first purshased this book on Amazons website. The artwork I thought was a little too rough for a two year old. I like the idea but I didn't feel there was enough positive reinforcement in it. I showed it to mom who is Montessori Teacher and she disliked it. She wouldn't added it to her room collection. I would make sure you really reinforce that you still love your child even though they may do things we do not LOVE!
2,Disapprove book,"This book is pretty negative. It shows a small child constantly failing. At the very end, he does one thing correct and is praised that one time. Also, David is illustrated a little evil looking. Children should not be portrayed as evil. In a world where children are expected to act as adults, this book shows little give for making mistakes and being accepted for them. More positive situations should have been added."
1,Boring,"I saw this book at the library (before buying it). There are very little words on the pages. The pictures are cute, but I don't think it's worth buying the book. I read it to my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she didn't really care about it; it did not keep her attention."
5,"This book is fun for grown up kids, too!","I have been reading NO, DAVID! to the children in my classroom for the past four years. They love it. Kids with little brothers and sisters identify. Sometimes a child will admit to acting like David.And of course, parents and school teachers identify, too!One of the times I read this book in my classroom, a parent was visiting. She laughed as hard or harder than the kids did!"
4,Excellent Value with lots o bells and whistles,I just purchased this reciever from BestBuy and am very impressed with it. This has the features of the higher end recievers at a fraction of the cost. With both DTS and Dolby Digital it fits nicely into my system. This is a replacement and an upgrade from a very old Pioneer reciever.
3,Nice nailer ....except for...,"I tried out my new Milwaukee 7150-21 after installing an air fitting (not included). Just like some of the other reviews said, the nailer would not drive any size brads completely unless you tip the nailer forward. Even at 120 lbs. pressure and max depth setting. Looks like I'll have to file it down like some of the others have, since the safety is too long with the pad on it. Is this just a bad batch, or is everyone having to modify their brand new 7150-21?"
1,Misty's Twilight,"Alright, I downright hated this book! All it talks about how this part Chincoteague part Thoroughbred becomes a superstar like all of the horse books that are written now. It is like no duh the horse is going to win because the horse is the main character of the book! And, what kind of nickname is ""Twi""? It's downright stupid. I just hated this book and I can not believe that some many people actually like this book. I think that the best illustration was when the ugly rat had her ribs sticking out. The worst was when she was doing all of the dressage moves. I mean, they only teach those moves at the Spanish Riding School, so Rat should not know them, especially a near perfect capriole."
4,"Great book, not quite as good as Best of 2001","Reading this book was a great experience, and I found a majority of the essays extremely moving. The book came out well before the end of 2002, so I wonder if perhaps they released it a little too early - perhaps the editors could have found some better essays had they waited longer. I'd give ""Best Spiritual Writing of 2001"" 5 stars -- every essay in that book was extremely moving and powerful. If you're only going to read 1 of the 2 books, I recommend the 2001 anthology."
4,Franklin the Turtle: I liked the book,"(By Jhanvi Girish 6 year old)Franklin is a turtle and really interesting boy. One day, Franklin and his friend Bear had a big fight. Because Franklin was too bossy. He always wants to play the games that he wants to play and not the games his wants to play. The book is about how they became friends again.I liked the book very much. I learnt that I should take turns."
5,The most complete Pacific Coast cycling book,"From someone who had never toured on a bike before, this book was my ""bible"". Having now toured many times in many different places, this book is the most complete, most accurate and most detailed I have ever seen. While riding down the coast, I photocopied the second half of the book to give to a German man who was floundering with his cycling association maps. He loved the review of the day's elevation climbs the most of all. On my second trip down the California coastline, I gave the book away to another couple. It's just that good, a must have book for the Pacific Coast."
4,It Really Works!,I've been using the product for several months now. I noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair after about 3 weeks. Plus I love the minty fragrance!
2,I just finished the first bottle and it will be my last.,"My hair dresser recommended this product. I've always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try. I just finished my first bottle of daily use. I don't see any difference in the amount of hair I see in the drain after I wash my hair. I don't like the smell (slight medicine-like smell, reminded me of mouthwash). And it is expensive!I just finished the first bottle and it will be my last."
1,Waste of $$$,"I've been using this item for about 3 weeks now and have noticed ZERO positive results!!!The only thing that I have noticed is that it made my hair very oily the next day and just seemed to clog the hair follicle.Yes it stopped the fall out BUT as soon as I washed my hair with a different shampoo to remove the buildup,it ended up falling out anyways. Was an absolute WASTE OF MONEY! I would never recommend this product to anyone. Wish I never bought it...especially for $20!!!!"
4,Nice late 60's rock with tinge of folk.....,"So homogenous it often sounds like one band performing everything, then at the very end things begin to digress and, sadly, decline. But for most of this body of work, we hear smooth original late 60's rock with a tinge of folk. I realized the appropriate metaphor for the CD when I heard the cover of ""You Tell Me Why"": the originators of that tune, the Beau Brummels. The production sometimes isn't very good, the fuzz guitars are sometimes more fuzz than anything. But all in all this is a very nice surprise. A few end tunes are more in a garage music style and, my Lord, has to be the worst version of ""Purple Haze"" you will EVER hear."
4,"Great For Fans, just be careful","I got this product, and its ADORABLE! Its fuzzy, with multiple eyes, teeth, and it even opens like the book it is. However, when you pull its tongue, its supposed to shake, I knew before I bought it that it was impossible to replace the battery after it wore out, but what I didn't know was that somehow, within the first day of owning it, the tongue somehow got over pulled and now sticks out and it only shakes for about a second, rather than the 15-ish that it shaked when I got it. So, be careful how far and hard you pull the tongue, or else it'll look like the book had a few too many ton-tongue toffee's!!"
2,Monster book? Monster gyp! Smaller than promised.,"The product description claims that the ""Harry Potter Monster Book"" is 12 x 9 x 4 inches in size. The actual dimensions are much closer to 10 x 8 x 3 inches. Admittedly, it is hard to measure a fuzzy object precisely but I have posted images here which show a clear discrepancy between the advertised size and the actual dimensions. Also, the Warner Bros. web site offers the same product for just $15.95 (as of 10/20/2010) and lists the dimensions more honestly as 10.5 x 8.5 x 3 inches."
3,HP Monster Book of Monsters Toy,"Well, I had seen the Harry Potter Monster Book of Monsters in a gift shop at Universal Studios, Orlando. My 11 year old loved the thing. It jumped about and made monster noises. So, being short on cash then, I bought it for him at Amazon through NECA (the vendor). Well, it doesn't move at all. You can pull the tounge and it vibrates and that's it. It doesn't make the growling sounds like the one I thought I was getting. There's no way I'm giving this to my son after he's seen the other one. Big disappointment for him on Christmas, no way!!! Thius one goes back to the vendor and I'll have to search again. Sob. I thought bait and switch was illegal..."
3,Lee Vs. Norris Jakie Vs. Urquidez Agreed 100%,I agree 100% with the reviewer. Cradle to the Grave should have been 'Off The Hook' Jet Lee Vs. Mark Dacascos should have had a fight unpalleled for years to come!!! Other than that fiasco; the movie was entertaining enough to see it! Again I'd like to know what were they thinking they had a Real mind Blower.
5,There is more to the stones than you think.,This movie may at first look like a movie full of incredable stunts and bad acting. But thats wrong this is a great movie. I love the action in this movie. Like the Raptor four wheeler chase. And the fight secnes with Jet Li.When Mr. Fait (DMX)steals these black diamonds that are wanted by an evil tawinese ex-agent. His daughter is kidnapper and with the help of a tawinese agent (Jet Li) they have to get her back. Soon Mr. Fait discovers there is more to the diamonds.
2,terrible.....................,"i am a huge fan of jet li and martial art movies and have been for nearly 15 years or so....so i've seen a fair few! this however is not one of the better ones!when i heard the cast list i was a little excited but only to be disappointed.dmx really cannot act.....i thought the role would be perfect for him as all he had to do was act 'gangsta' and swear a lot...but he couldn't even manage that convincingly enough.....jet li was not as prominent in this movie as i thought he would be which was disappointing really......dacascos was also another disappointment.....this guy is awesome and the final fight scene was not nearly as memorable or competitive enough between him and jet as it could have been....however, tom arnold was funny in his bits as well as anthony anderson, but that was the only highlights in a terrible movie....definetly won't be buying this on dvd........."
1,Waste of money,"had to replace the batteries after 2 days ( under 4hours of use ), stopped working after 10 days, total waste of money!"
5,Great Little Mouse,The mouse that I got from Amazon is the best wireless mouse for the money that I have used.
4,Wireless Mouse: So far so good,I bought this product based on other reviews and so far so good. I'm using it with the Mac Pro Book. Easy instalation and very light mouse.
3,It has been good,I has worked just fine since long time ago. The scroll is a little hard but I cant complain about its lifetime and precision.
2,uncomfortable for hand,"This mouse is a nice product, except after a while it cramps up my hand. It technically works great, and looks nice. After a while of use though, my hand cramps up. I believe it's because the mouse is smaller than most others. I like the on/off button and the batteries seem to be lasting a while. I leave the mouse on all the time, and it falls asleep to preserve power."
1,Piece of junk,"I just opened the package of my new mouse, inserted the batteries...and somehow, some tiny piece of the battery cover must have snapped off. Now it won't go back on. I might as well have flushed $25 down the toilet, as the thing is instantly unusable. I didn't even force the cover off, and certainly couldn't tell that something broke until I tried to put it back on. Save yourself the grief and purchase a different mouse."
2,"Wonderful singer, horrible recording","I love Pedro Infante. There is noone that can sing like him. That is why when I bought this CD I was truelly dissapointed because it was hard to hear his magnificiant voice. This recording appeared to sound like some took his original LP and put a sheet over the microphone, he sounded so muffled. I truelly love this artist, and becuase of that I realy hated how they rerecorded his songs."
4,"Pain and elation, all at once","Pedro Infante was one of those rare artists, who can command respect and pity at the same time. his music, his songs are achingly beautiful, and yet to know he died so young is a heartbreaker. Ramiro bur is right on the money in his bio essay in the ""Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican Music,"" on Billboard Books: ""In the history of Mexican pop culture, there has never been an artist who captured the hearts and minds of Mexicans like the ranchera singer/film actor Pedro Infante."" So true and yet, so sad. LaNancy"
2,For youth readers.,This book is geared for a 5th or 6th grade reader. If your kids are in that age group then they might find it interesting.
5,Better than a gas mower,"I used this mower for an entire season and it is as good (if not better) than my old gas powered one. It took on my overgrown yard like a champ, when a gas powered would normally choke.Pros:1. Very light. I can easily lift it and pull it up a hill with one arm.2. Quieter than gas-powered mowers.3. No oil, gas, or priming. The only maintenance is wiping the blades off occasionally.4. Doesn't exhaust fumes like a gas mower.5. It looks like a giant Fischer-Price toy, but this thing can really cut your yard very well. My yard was so overgrown when I got this thing, and it never once choked and shut down like gas mowers sometimes do. Plus, it mulches very well--no huge piles of grass to rake up.Cons:1. The cord. A minor nuisance that you quickly get used to. This really isn't a problem unless you have a lot of trees or statues or rocks in your yard."
3,Was working fine then...,"Worked fine once we got use to the cord. We liked that it was light (41 lbs) and easy to push. Only negitive was I noticed it does not cut very well if you pull it backwards.2 months of use then... it all came to an end. I had lowered the cutting height and found a hidden pipe in our yard. I thought it had bent the blade. New blade right?! So off to blackanddecker.com. After much hunting I called the 800 number and found that the parts for Black & Decker are listed on Dewalt.com?New blade on its way! Once it was installed I learned that was not the only thing bent! The main shaft was bent! ...Time for a new mower, again.We may get the same one as I have a spare blade."
2,Less than it seems. . .,"Light weight is good, easy to manuever. . . but, it also vibrates quite strongly and can be annoying to hold on to. One other thing. . . the cord. Mower instructions suggest that a 100 foot cord can be used and should be 12 guage. Problem is, that guage cord does not fit the cord minder, so cord tends to vibrate out of the socket. A simple little plastic clamp could have been included to keep the cord from falling out."
1,they don't make them like they used to!!!!,"i've owned b&d; electric mowers since the early nineties.i still have an older ""green"" model that works, but since i bought a new model MM575, i've had to replace it twice. the motor has burned out on all 3 new mowers.i can only blame myself for buying this mower 3 times in 5 years. i'm back to using my 20 year old model that's still going strong.B&D; has been willing to replace the motor, but i'd have to pay for shipping and repair. it was cheaper, each time to just buy a new mower on sale either here on amazon or at my local sears hardware store.not anymore. i'm done buying b&d; tools. they've obviously stopped making quality products and are just saturating the marketplace with cheap crap!!!!"
4,We're Happy,"Black & Decker Lawn Hog 18-Inch 12 Amp Electric Mulching Mower #MM575My husband and I are in our 80's and do not have good luck with gas motors so decided on the electric mower from Black and Decker and we are happy with it. We have NOT run over the cordand are happy with the ease in selecting mower height and the way the yard looks after use of the mower.It cleans easily and stores easily in our garage.FVS, Texas"
5,A Girl's view of Rattlebone,"Rattlebone is great book to read, not for just African-Americans, but for the many people who have encountered a moment of being different. Maxine Clair used many different interviews she had to come up with the different chapters she had in this novel. In doing so, she opened my eyes to another world that I had yet to discover. Her stories made me realize that society today, has way more than what it had in the past. We need to stop blaming one another for the past, and make what we have now, so much better so that we don't have to live the lives of the characters in Rattlebone."
1,Read Mr. Rainey's review,"I've never written a book review. This is my first one. But I read a lot of them and buy most of my books because of them. I bought this book about a year ago and recently picked it up to try, once more, to read it. When I got frustrated with it, I came here to find out why I bought it in the first place and discovered the battle waged here by the author and Mr. Rainey.I can only say, I wish Mr. Rainey's review had been here last year. I would have saved my money. He is not exaggerating when he says the authors writing style is ""deplorable"". This book may contain some great information, but it has never been able to hold my attention for more than a few minutes at a time."
5,Nice sharp well balanced blade,"The old blade lasted almost four years in Florida where you mow every week, winter & summer. The new one stops the vibration the old one had gotten from repeated sharpening"

4,"LIFE WITHOUT MUSIC WOULD BE A MISTAKE, RIGHT?","1 Nice Christmas gift. (Thanks WBHW!)2 Belt clip should be mandatory on all portable cd players! Love it! Love it! Love it!3 Problem--not loud enough. (I'm a head banger like the ""electronics fan from Dallas, TX"" reviewer. {Smiles} The only way to listen to Dream Theater is full volume!)4 Above ""problem"" solved by replacing headphones provided (too-short cord for exercising/jogging too by the way) with longer, alien-ear lookin' ear buds by Sony. (I'll review that next.)5 Plays burned cds perfectly. (Thanks ZA!)6 Doesn't skip as promised and I have even dropped it! Oopsie! Ha. Tough little puppy.7 Recommended.Music is my elixir. This little gadget makes me very happy. Rock on everyone and soar to the music!"
1,Tony,"This mower has a few significant design flaws. The on-switch is a pinch hazzard. When my old electric mower died after 20 years, I ordered this one. In the MM275's first use, my right palm was pinched at least 4 or 5 times by the dead-man's switch lever (and I was never pinched by my old one). The lever is just too small and cheap, but is the perfect size to provide pretty healthy pinches. The handle doesn't fold, so moving it in and out of the basement is cumbersome. And, the front edge of the mower is at least 6 inches away from the blade, making it impossible to cut close to anything in front of the mower."
5,I love this mower!,"This is the best thing I've gotten in years! The handle tabs were a little confusing, larger pictures on the instructions would have helped but nevertheless, it was easy to assemble. I just mowed my back yard in 10 minutes, no deafening noise, no fumes, no wrestling with a heavy awkward mower. It even mulched a small pile of leaves I had raked up. No problem chopping up twigs. Definitely going to enjoy mowing from now on...used to hate it only because of the above 3 reasons. Oh...and the money it will save is a very nice perk.Oh, and Amazon had this shipped and at my door in less than a week!"
2,breaks too easily,"I've owned two Black & Decker electric mowers in six years, and I've gone through three motors in that time. Two motors burned out, and the third broke its housing. I don't abuse them -- they're just not built to last. I really like the idea of electric mowers, but Black & Decker doesn't build very good ones. My next mower will use gas, or at least won't be a Black & Decker."
2,Bad Idea,"I've had the displeasure of having no other choice but to use this lawnmower to my lawn this season and let me tell you that it's almost unbearable. Granted the quality of this product is in fact quite good so I won't give it a one star review, but the concept is totally brain damaged. Whoever thought that tethering a lawnmower to a wall outlet was a good idea obviously hasn't thought it through very much- imagine going over your entire yard with a vacuum cleaner- yeah, it's that bad. The cord will invariably get caught on something and constantly gets in the way of the user requiring them to cast it away every 8 or so feet, and of course the possibility of getting electrocuted for running the damn thing over just makes it even worse. This product is really only suitable for very small yards with very few or no obstacles, though if you have a yard like that then you're better off buying a high quality manual lawn mower - there's so much less to go wrong and it'll last longer."
4,Good cutter if you can deal with the cable dance,"Actually the mower itself gets 5 points but i was not used to electric mowers, so i gave 4 because of the little inconvenience with the cable. Dealing with cable seemed more of a work than actual mowing in my small end unit townhome lawn. This is very light weight, so you dont feel like putting effort into it while mowing, even when it does not self drive which is case of some gas powered mowers. I cut almost 8 inch grass to 3 inch without any problem. I never tried when wet, but dry grass even taller grass seemed no problem at all for this mower. I would really suggest this mower if you are aware of how to deal with the cable when mowing. May be small length cables are good if you have multiple outlets with in reach."
4,We5paks,I bought this from Babies R Us registry as a gift. The picture was very pretty and of good quality. I was pleased with it.
1,Not even close!,"I used this book solely as a review for the CLEP exam, and received a score of 55 (barely passing) as opposed to the actual CLEP books - I got a 96 using the ""official CLEP guide"".This book barely has any of the actual test material included in it, and the test had many, many things not even remotely touched upon in the book. I definitely will NOT use this brand again."
1,DREADFUL!,"I was looking for a DVD on elephants for my son, who is two and quite keen on the pachyderms. I wanted to wean him off cartoons (his favourite is the elephant scene in Jungle Book) and get him to see a bit of variety, so I was quite happy when I read the storyline of this film, set in india and about a boy who befriends a baby elephant.Well, it took me 50 seconds to understand why I've never head of this movie, and a dogged half an hour waiting for it to improve, against all odds, which it didn't. This movie is TERRIBLE. The acting is stilted and formulaic, the filming is dreadful, the colour not at all good.. it almost felt like I was watching a rental VHS tape.Can I recommend it? NO. Not unless you are deaf dumb and blind, like using DVD's for frisbies, into masochism, or an alien from outer space who is interested in our (lack of) culture. This is the worst review I have ever given.. I always try and look for SOMETHING good.. The picture on the cover of a boy on an elephant. That's it!"
4,Lon Chaney shins as Mummy,The mummy played buy Chaney goes to New England to kill the people who encountered him in the Mummy's hand. The only problem I had with this movie is it was it showed a lot of footage from the Mummy's hand and even Frankenstein and the Bride of Frankenstein.It was to short a movie to use as much previously seen footage as shown.
3,Is it irreverent if they have to explain that it's irreverent?,"This book isn't nourishing, but it provides a certain short-lived fun. I wouldn't go as far as ""guilty pleasure"" fun, as it isn't that naughty or silly, and it certainly doesn't have the quality of a song from your teen years, in that it is possible, quite possible, to get it out of your head; it's more on the order of that annoying kid in your freshman dorm who couldn't stop wisecracking. You snicker, but it's just not particularly useful. My sense is that this book gives you the illusion of being an insider without actually giving you anything particularly clever, to say nothing of anything that you wouldn't get from another more conventional guide-book. It's not a bad book, and the information is correct as far as it goes, but you will get more real scope for your outsider attitude from a close reading of the mainstream Frommer's, and even more from the Eyewitness guides."
2,"Felt like it was written for the author, not the reader","Like most of the other reviewers, I fell in love with Mythago Wood and have recommended it to friends for years.So I was very disappointed to find that reading Lavondyss is much like living it: once you start, you better be prepared for a very long, convoluted journey during which you will have no idea what is going on and probably end up old, gray and none the wiser by the time you finish.The undoubtedly powerful and primitive basis for the story loses most of its impact due to the rambling events and story structure.It felt very much as if Mr. Holdstock had entered his own rabbit hole and is so enthralled with the world he's created that he stopped worrying about narrative, reader enjoyment and such worldly matters."
3,Identical to hardcover,"This manual is identical to another book on Amazon, but is a much cheaper quality print. The price is the same so I would recommend getting the hardcover the drawings are much tighter. The other book is called ""Workshop Manual for the Alfa Romeo Giulia 1300, Giulia 1600, 1750, 2000, 1962-78 (Autobooks #724)"" This book, however, is good to have to use so you don't ruin the other book while working on your Alpha."
4,Good story for good people,"This was a fun read and a nice story about a guy and his family who kept working and stuck to their principles and succeeded. I dont know if there are a lot of lessons on business here other than work hard, do good and treat people right which of course is enough in most cases. But enjoyed the book and its nice when nice people make it and not the bums at the top of most of Americas so called 'top companies'. Worth the price and your time."
4,Great starter mower for this first time homeowner!,"This is the first mower that I've ever bought and I think it works great. I agree that the cord becomes something to manage and probably adds about 10 minutes to mowing my lawn, but this is the first mower I've ever bought. From seeing my neighbors deal with their gas mowers, my little electric one is a great conversation starter. It is powerful enough to mow my lowcountry 0.6 acre lawn, including some lagoon frontage. I would recommend this mower, but I may consider jumping up to the cordless one when the price drops. :) Happy mowing!Oh, on a separate note - everyone needs to buy this book:The Revolution: A ManifestoCheers!"
4,Good for city Lots,Had a little problem in the assemblng of the handle. The instructions weren't very clear. The machine runs well and does a decent job on the lawn but you always have to keep in mind the location of the cord. My husband ran over the cord the first time he used it and since then he has been more observant of its location. Easy start and handling.
5,Ralph,"Just wanted to say Thank You to Amazon not just for their speedy delivery of the electric lawn mower,but it was so easy to assemble and use.Quiet,no gas or smoke,light and I actually enjoyed cutting the grass,it was almost like vacuuming your carpet,I would recommend this mower to anyone that is tired of that noisy lawn mower and gasoline smell.I recently had an eye operation,and my wife said to purchase an electric mower to avoid any objects from flying around due to a gas power mower,and she was 100% correct,no flying grass or dust.Thank YouRalph"
5,great lawnmower,"Great buy at $149.99!! Lighter weight, easier to raise & lower blades, & just as powerful as my previous machine.Also, free-shipping option (slower) was still very quick."
1,**** - Love Black & Decker,"We prefer the convenience of an electric mower over the heavier, more maintenance-intensive gasoline powered mowers.Black & Decker is by far the best of the electric mowers: it is sturdy, well-built, has good features and extras, and costs no more than the competition. This model has an adjustment for height of mowing. As always, the plug-in for the electric cord is solid (especially when compared to some I saw at a big box store).I do most of the mowing (female, over 60) and find the machine light enough to be manageable, but sturdy enough to be dependable.With free shipping from Amazon, it's a much better product for the money than what could be purchased locally."
4,Excellent light duty mower,"This is a great mower for the price, assembles easily, requires no real maintenence, gas or oil. It's not as powerful as most gas powered mowers, so if you have a really large lawn or have to cut really tall grass, this is not the best choice, but for the average small to medium lawn it works just fine. Very reliable as long as you don't abuse it. Tall heavy grass will bog down the motor quickly and clog up the output chute. Excellent for light duty lawn care, quieter than a gas mower, requires no ""tune ups, spark plugs, gas or oil, produces no pollution."
4,Wife loves it,"My wife handles the lawn mowing chores at our house. We don't have a lot of lawn, but what we do have is on uneven terrain. She never liked messing with oil & gas mixes and the loud, smelly, heavy gasoline mowers we've had before. This electric is exactly what she wanted. It's quiet and lightweight, which helps immensely as she is a small person and like myself, not exactly a spring chicken (don't tell her I said that; she might make me mow).It is a corded electric, but as we have outlets strategically placed around our exterior, is easy to work with.Yes, having to stop and move the cord and replug it can be annoying, but still beats gas cans and even weak or dead batteries in a cordless type."
1,Save your money,"This mower is cheaply built and flimsy. After only moving 6 times with it, the motor seized. I took it into a Black & Decker repair facility and they informed me that the magnet in the motor had shattered and that it was not covered by their warranty. Then they informed me it wold cost $79-$100 to fix. So I say to all you shoppers out there in the market for an electric mower, pass this one up."
3,dlmcdadefarm,"It always worked fine on my John Deere 4230 until I attempted to remove it to use the tractor, yesterday. The heater housing came off in my hand. The housing plastic had melted and allowed the two mounting screws to slide out. The magnetic heating element was still on the oil pan and the plastic housing was in my hand. This is dangerous! The mounting screws need to be lengthened so the screw head protrudes outside the plastic housing. Maybe the heat will not affect the screw fastener mounting if it is redesigned in this manner, or similar? In any case, the design needs to be changed due to the danger."
5,first movie,"This is from what I understand Lucy and Desis first movie after doing their t.v. series and it is a great screwball comedy, with the great Lucy comedy in it. In the series she always manages to get herself in trouble and here there is no exceptions. You have to get it and watch it to enjoy it."
3,enjoyable,"this movie was humorous and enjoyable, but nothing great. We rented it, and it kept us entertained to watch on a flight."
2,Just buy them separately!,"The Long, Long, Trailer is worth the money. But the other two, particularly Too Many Girls is really not worth it! The Forever Darling is just O.K.. Again, I would really rather have you save some money and by them individually."
4,2 out of 3 were pertaining to travel,"If golden age of movies and traveling are your thing, then you'll enjoy this delightful collection of Lucy and Desi's heyday movies. Our favorite is the Long, Long Trailer, but the others are worth watching as well."
5,R.I.P. BK!,i love this disc every track pure classicFavorite Track:Gimme Da loot (all are classic)Guests:Method Man and Easy Mo Bee10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats
5,Nothing Compares,Who can compare this guy to any other rappers first of all.Where do u have an album with straight hardcore lyricism and hard beats that make u just wanna keep listening to the next song? Notorious BIG was one of the best rappers and this album is the one that made him so famous and all the songs on this album are classics and its some of his best work so i strongly advise getting this CD. Can 50cent or ja rule or any of todays rappers have this kind of ability or are they just trying to copy biggie and 2pacs gangstaness this is a true thrilla
4,buy biggie not tupac,ready to die has all the hot joint's like big poppa and everyday struggle just a shame it don't have i'm just playing.track eight is a bit dodgy and could have done without that on it. you only have to listen to a couple of joint's and you can tell how most of biggies life was. so just buy the album then buy the rest and look real good for the hard to find tracks couse they are the best
3,"Overatted, lack of originality, wrong guidence","Don't get me wrong Biggie was a great rapper. But had the wrong guidence(P.Diddy) and went to the wrong label(bad boy). There is a lack of originality and too many samples. Biggie was better off at Interscope or Def Jam. Biggie:great lyricist, but wrong guidence and production.The inteludes are also too Pornographic. There's one interlude were he's having sex with Lil Kim and another Interlude were Lil Kim is giving Biggie [felatio] for the first time.Recomend it if you love Biggie."
5,Biggie,This cd is a great record by the well-known Notorious B.I.G. This cd is self explanatory on it's effects it had on rap. Just listen to it once and you will see how Notorious B.I.G. got famous off of his first cd. Ready To Die!!
5,If I could give this CD 10 stars I would.,"The first time that I actually listened to this CD straight, I was blown away. I have been a rap fan for year's, but I never really listened to this CD. I mean I heard Juicy and Big Poppa, and that's about as far as that went. This CD is a masterpiece, and in my opinion the best Rap CD to date. Song's like ""Gimme the Loot"" and the self titled track ""Ready to die"" are hard hitting gangster rap songs. And praise the lord P Diddy didn't ruin this CD like he did on ""Life after Death"". Life after Death is a great CD, but you can definatley see that Puffy had a stronghold over it. Top cut's on this CD: ""Ready to die"", ""The What"", ""Gimme the Loot"" and ""Things done changed"""
2,Thiz iz not a good Cd 4 tha tru hip-hop fan 2 buy,"Thiz iz not a good Cd at all, even if it iz Biggie's debut album. Tha only reason I didn't give it 1 star iz cuz it haz one good song on it- ""Big Poppa."" But thatz it. For tha tru rap fans tha two best Cds 2 buy R 2Pac's ""All Eyez On Me"" which won the award 4 tha 1996 best rap album of tha year and DMX's ""Its Dark And Hell Is Hot"""
1,B ad boys attempt to make more money,"Remixed and remastered? before listening to this cd I anticipated that this was not only remastered for better sound quality but also remixed for a new verison of biggies ready to die cd (a must buy for any true hip hop fan) but after listening to this cd i came to find that it was the same cd as the orignal except a few bonus tracks (literally 3 new tracks). Don't waste my time. If you already own ready to die , don't waste the money for this sad excuse of a ""remix"" cd...If you are a true BIG fan these tracks are ones you've already heard and not worth 14 more dollars...shame on you bad boy records...BIG just rolled over in his grave..."
4,ready to die,"Notorious BIG on his first solo album, it's just another classic form the east coast. This is a very tight album, my favorites songs are machine gun funk, juicy, big poppa and unbelievable. Big definately made his mark on the world of hip hop with this. The only negative thig is Puffy, the worst producer ever, if biggie satyed with tupac and did not have the negative puffy influence it would have been much better, biggie is good but his label is bag, it's just like that."
1,"TITLE SHOULD READ ""VIC DAMON""","THIS CD HAS SONGS THAT ARE SUNG BY VIC DAMON. IT WAS RECORDED BY ORFEON AND THE NUMBERS ON IT ARE CD20095. IT HAS PEDRO INFANTE'S NAME PRINTED ON THE CD AND THERE IS A VERY GOOD PICTURE OF HIM WHEN YOU UNFOLD THE PAPER THAT IS ON THE FRONT OF THE CD.SOMEONE HAS PROBABLY ORDERED VIC DAMON'S CD AND IS NOW LISTENING TO PEDRO INFANTE! LUCKY FOR THEM.THIS IS A BIG MIX-UP, BUT I'M SURE IT WILL BE CORRECTED. EVEN AFTER 40 SOME YEARS, HE IS STILL THE MOST POPULAR SINGER ON MY LIST."
5,"""High Spirits"" highly rated.","Robertson Davies is an excellent writer. Original, highly imaginative, and possessed of an engaging style. ""High Spirits: A Collection of Ghost Stories"" is penultimate evidence of that. Christopher Plummer, who reads the stories, is an actor of long standing excellence. Quite simply, no one could match his work in reading these stories. Nuanced, varied, and unfailingly engaging, Plummer's work is not simply reading. He creates characters, atmosphere, and a sense of time and place which is unequalled by anyone who practices the craft of narrating stories. He does not simply narrate. Nor does he merely excellently act the parts he reads. He tells the story with the authority and feeling of one who is creating the story as he tells it. An excellent read by itself, ""High Spirits: A Collection of Ghost Stories"" is a vacation to listen to. One to which I have returned many times to marvel and enjoy the unparalleled work of two artists."
5,I love this mower!,"Use it for our summer place. Replaced an old gas mower. Always starts! Cuts grass 10"" high. It's plastic, so you have to be careful, also have to watch it with the cord (no toxic batteries!). I use it 2-4 times a year and I'm really pleased with it. I don't like rechargeable units because the batteries are not always safely recycled. This one can mulch and bag, but the bag is small."
3,LAWN MOWER,"CUTS GOOD, A LITTLE TO HEAVY , REAR BAG IS SETUP GOOD, EASY TO EMPTY.....""GOOD COLOR, CAN'T LOSE IT"" !!!!!!!!!"
5,Dandy Electric Lawn Mower,"I really like it! Assembly was a snap -- essentially nothing to do but lift up and tighten the handle, then set the catcher bag in place. It's light to handle and maneuver while mowing. The minor trouble of keeping the power cord out of the track of the electric mower is way less agravating than having to keep gasoline on hand and deal with the noise and pollution of a gas engine. The ""one touch"" cutting height adjustment really is just that -- very simple and easy. What else could I ask for in a lawn mower?"
4,A Nice Product,"I bought the Craftsman alternative to this but it is essentially the same mower. I bought it to have something lightweight I could carry up and down the stairs from the basement because I lack an outside enclosure. It works wonderfully for my small 1/4 acre yard and managing the cord is not very hard except for some annoying obstacles (old tree trunks, etc). My only complaint so far would be the bag. The angle it comes in at just seems to make you empty it long before its filled."
4,Good but could be better,This is a good sturdy unit. It is fairly quiet. The one-touch raise/lower feature works well. I had an earlier version of the B&D electric that enabled you to flip the handles which enabled you to reverse directions without making any turns. I don't know why they dropped that feature.
4,Impressed with the power,I recently moved into a house with a garden so for the first time ever I had a lawn that needed to be cut. The previous people hadn't bothered. So when I bought this lawn mower I wasn't sure what to expect. I have to say though I was very impressed. It was cutting grass that was knee high without too many problems. I did take a star off however because not all the clippings went into the bag. And although for me an amateur this is not a problem I can see it would drive others crazy. But if you want something to just keep your grass short without the worry of gas. I would recommend this item as you can plug in and go!
2,liked it while it lasted,"Probably used it 15 times before the motor died. Which in my opinion is not very good considering that the size of my yard is minuscule.After that it took a few months to find a place to send it to, since it was still under warranty, the closest place to drive was Canada. Black and Decker was kind enough to send a box to mail it in, it came with directions! Shortly thereafter we are called to be informed that the motor has burned out and this is not covered under the warranty. It is true that we are not greatest with lawn care and that yes we wait, perhaps a week longer than we should, to mow the grass. And because of this it can be pretty thick. But we adjust the mower and make more than one pass. Why should this cause the motor to burn out?? I know it it electric, but really.... It makes me want to go back to the noisy, gas guzzler, which we ended up having to borrow from the in laws to mow the grass the rest of the summer. Hooray! So much for saving the environment!!"
1,Not satisfied with this mower,"This mower would not pick up all of the clippings. It would leave a trail on either side so I had to go over the grass twice (in the opposite direction). I also have to empty the bag when it is 1/3 full otherwise more clippings spill out. The cutting swath is narrow so you're already pushing the mower more than a 21"" gas mower. Add the cord management and using this mower took me about 3-4 times longer to mow than with a gas mower.It also cannot handle a damp or even slightly damp lawn. The discharge chute easily clogs.I got sick of taking 3-4 hours to mow my lawn and emptying the bag every time it got 1/3 full, so I got my money back and bought a gas mower."
2,Be Careful With This Mower,"Pros: Easy to use, light, no gas, no maintenance.Cons: Flimsy. Even though the motor shaft on this mower is metal, the deck is made of plastic. I was mowing around a tree and the blade hit a small root that was sticking up out of the ground about 1 inch. This was enough force/bend the whole blade and shaft which sent the blade careening up into the mower deck. I thought the mower was going to be damaged beyond repair as the incident caused the shaft to be out of alignment. But the whole thing is so flimsy, I was able to manipulate it back into place. Plus I had to replace the part which is called the ""fan."" This part goes between the deck and the blade and got busted up when the blade hit the root.Needless to say the mower is still working. But I regret purchasing it. If you are used to a mower with a metal deck, you need to be really careful that you don't hit anything with the blade."
4,Black and Decker MM875 Lawn Hog,I have cut with it 3 times and greatly prefer it to power mowers in all respects but 1. I think that the fan effect that makes the grass stand up is weaker than in my old power mower so I have to lower the cut level to get the length of grass that I want. Managing the electric cable does not trouble me.
2,Lawn Mower Review,The lawn mower does an adequate job on my lawn. It is a lot less convenient than my old gas mower. The cord is always in the way and at times the mower seems a little under powered.
4,Electric Mower,"This is a fine mower, plenty of power ( with the right extenion cord ), light weight, very easy to adjust the height of cut. I have a 100ft 12 gauge cord that barely fits but works great. Handling the cord is a drawback but a reasonable trade-off.Update: This mower just works, anytime(except in the rain!) You cannot lose focus because of the electrical cord and my mom does not like it for that reason. But no need to mess with oil or spark plugs and filters. Just does the job and stows away ready for the next job a week or months later. Easy to handle -light and cut adjustment a dream to use. Very durable with no effort - but you cannot let a kid use it, a reasonable trade off."
1,Scrap after one year,"I bought this mower a year ago at Home Depot. A couple of weeks ago a flame came out of the control switch unit while I was mowing, and Black and Decker gave me UPS shipping authorization to send it back for warranty repair (they have a two-year warranty). The call agent didn't seem at all surprised about the fire. And this morning I got a call from a guy at the service center who tells me that the repair is NOT covered under warranty because the blade has been nicked. Apparently this mower is pretty fragile. I have a couple of areas to cut that are rough, and I have whacked a rock or two. With electric mowers (or maybe just electric mowers of this quality?), that can destroy the motor. Funny they didn't mention that when I bought it. I can't recommend this mower. Even if your yard is perfectly smooth, you're going to hit something some day, and then your mower will be scrap."
2,Unreliable,"I decided to go green and bought electric mower, edger/trimmer and blower (all corded). I felt like driving Prius while mowing the lawn :)It did not last long though. I mowed the lawn first time with factory settings and it worked fine. I was going on the vacation so I set it to cut 2 inches. It barely worked for 5 feet and stopped. I reverted the setting but it would not start. Since it was still under 30 day return window, I decided to call it a day.Pros:- Going green is responsible things to do- No smoke is blessing for people with allergies like me.- Pretty light weight- Assembly is pretty simpleCons:- Be ready to shell out $30-40 for cord- Mowing with cord is not simple as it seems. I felt dumb at times wondering which direction to mow now.- Not as powerful as gas mower and not self-propelled.- Unreliable (it broke down with in 3 weeks)"
5,better than expected,"well i haven't tried it yet but as soon as it came-on time- i opened it and was shocked by how surprisingly big it was. second, i looked under the mower and the blade is surprisingly bigger and tougher than i expected. plus there was almost no assembly required. overall, looks sturdy and tough, and just might last a while. and for a great price too! will update once i start it."
3,inaccurate catalog listing,"this was listed under cordless electric lawn mowers, which is what i wanted. but, when it arrived i found that it in fact, does use a cord."
4,easy to use and maintain,"I am a big fan of electric lawn tools and this mower is no exception. It is quieter than gas mowers, it does not emit smelly exhaust fumes, no start cord to pull, and is virtually maintenence-free. I like to cut the grass early in the morning and with this mower, I don't have to worry about waking the neighbors. I used it on my 0.15 acre lot and it is pretty easy to tame the cord-just mow from the electrical recepticle outwards and the cord will remain on the already mowed portions (much like vacuuming a rug indoors). The mulch feature works fine if you don't let the grass grow too high between cuttings. It is durable and has held up fine for 3 years. All this for a reasonable price."
1,BOOOOOOOORING!,"Awful movie even for a low budget b sort-of-horror/action movie. Completely generic, uninteresting, and not worth your time or attention. Great box art but hollow movie. I knew better renting it, still did it. Don't make my mistake."
3,Small package,"This seems to be a quality product albeit a little small. It holds a small pair of headphones and a small to medium sized MP3 player and not much else. I use it for the gym. I work out very hard and this item does absorb sweat. I have had to wash it once already. It is not immune from slipping down my arm either. Otherwise, it's fine."
5,Great thermos for hot drinks!,"This keeps tea or coffee hot while looking stylish on the table. It holds about 3 or 4 cups of tea.I like the design and semi transparent color, and will enjoy making a pot of tea instead of one cup at a time."
2,"Good condition means ""yellow.""","I was happy to receive this book and received it within a matter of days. However, the book was not in ""good"" condition based on my standards. Rather, the pages were yellow and and the book felt brittle. Nonetheless, and when I'm up to it, I'll re-order another one. In the meantime, I will certainly enjoy the contents of the one I have."
5,Another Great Phoebe Grant Novel!,"Join Phoebe Grant as she takes advantage of a cheap airfare to England, leaving her problems at home in the States. Of course, it's convenient that Alex, the man who seems perfect for Phoebe, has gone to England to help his own family.I laughed with Phoebe and shared her disappointments throughout her journey toward realizing what God wants for her life. The ending was surprising but satisfying.Although I've never been a single Christian woman, I loved this book and easily identified with Phoebe. Her trials are those of a Christian woman, rather than of a single Christian woman. The ""single"" element merely highlights Phoebe's individual problems, which we all have in one form or another.Walker's real-life writing is humorous and ""spot on,"" as the Brits say. I hope she plans a third book in this series, because I'll be in line to buy it!"
3,Wishing I'd read the 1 star reviews before buying...,Loved both books in this series till I got to the ending of the second...felt so let down I can't even tell you. It's like all the build up and journey was pointless if you are actually looking for a happy ENDING...what we have here is just another leg of a journey and if there isn't a sequel then what we have here is a disappointed and incomplete story... if you can't give it a proper ending what's the reward for reading the book? Oh yeah...just disappointment.
4,Good lawnmower,"What I like about this lawnmower is the ability of the handle to flip over the top. This is very convenient for working along walls and at the ends of spaces where flipping the handle is much easier and more convenient than turning the lawnmower around. Actually, I owned an almost identical model for many years that finally gave out, and this purchase was a replacement. The new model seems a little more powerful, which is nice. Overall, seems like a good product to me."
3,Great for 3 seasons,"I loved this mower. Great for small yards. Light weight, low maintenance, no gas. Easy height adjustment. The cord takes a little getting use to but, it's manageable with the flip handle. Worked great the 1st season. The 2nd season I had to replace the fan. Not a big deal a $12 part, takes about 15 minutes to fix. But the 3rd season the motor died. I was hoping to get at least 5 good years out of this mower. Might consider buying another one if an extended warranty was available."
1,Pass On This One,"For the money, this mower is not worth it. Mine only lasted for 3 years before the motor went up in smoke. In that same time I had to replace the base plates that attach the handle to the mower deck (they broke under the ""stress"" of being pushed I guess), as well as the lower part of the handle which cost me about $40 in the end. After 3 years the motor started sparking and became unusable. I replaced the brush heads, but it is the magnetic ring that is the problem. It will cost $70 to purchase that part...not interested. I caved and bought a regular gas mower instead and have never been happier."
4,"Received defective, however","I had to return my mower. The power cord from the handle to the mower wasn't long enough and prevented the handle from being connected to the mower. However, my neighbor had one that he didn't need and let me try it. By this time my lawn was over grown. I was amazed at the power of the mower and how well it handled thick tall grass. I like the fact that there is no need for gas or oil and so their is no pollution. There is also a lot less noise. I was so pleased with it that I bought his mower. I highly recommend this product."
5,MM675,This is the first electric mower I have owned and I have found it to be easier to use than a gas powered mower. It is lighter than a gas mower and is less tiring to use in spite of not being self propelled. The flip over handle is a must have feature to prevent cord tangles and is the reason that I purchased the MM675 rather than one of the other models. All in all it is an excellent mower and allows me to finish the yard (front and back) in less time than did the self propelled mower that it replaced. I have not owned it long enough to comment on reliability but if it is the same quality as past Black & Decker products I have owned it should hold up very well. I would highly recommend this mower to anyone who is considering an electric lawn mower.
3,"It's cheap, but you get what you pay for.","Heck, it's not a serious tool set, but it is a good all-in-one need-something-for-the-apartment set. The downfall of all the tool-sets is that if you break a tool or lose a tool, you can't find a replacement to fit in the exact blow-molded spot.HINT: buy the tool set and then go to your local hardware store and pick up a cheap toolbox to store the tools in. This way, you will be able to augment, change, replace your tools over time without behind stuck with the cheasy case."
3,Very Difficult Read,"Though there are some fascinating concepts explored in this book, the author's very complex prose and sentence style gets in the way of what he is trying to express. Some of his sentences are very difficult to interpret, and others may not even be in real English, as far as their structures are concerned. After reading a few pages, many times I could not remember what where the essential points he tried to get across due to his over-flowery language style and alliterations."
5,From the pen of an extraordinary storyteller...,"Comes the tale of a young man, growing up in the brief lull between the 1st and 2nd Crusades. The rich imagery, and unparallelled storytelling abilities of Ronald Welch are shown in their full glory, in this story which takes us through the horrors of the disastrous 2nd Crusade. It explores the courage of a man growing to adulthood in the shadow of slavery. Share the triumph of the 3rd Crusade, and join Philip on his journey home at last to misty England, where challenges of a different sort await. If you haven't read this book - I feel deeply sorry for you. It's an essential read for every history enthusiast."
5,Quality Cutter,"Bought the 3/8"" cutter for cutting a plug for my oak floor to remove a burn mark. Cutter was sharp and worked without any problems. No burn marks on the plug resulting in a very good repair job."
1,DVD-955S,"I have the DVD-2910 and I am returning the DVD-955S, I had them in seperate rooms of course. My player (DVD-955S) has bugs, has a hard time detecting CDs, takes more than 10 secs. to load, sound drops out and any given moment. When it works, it works great, but most of the time, I have to wait on it to work right. I purchased it shipped for less than 302.00, but it is still not worth the pain. My DVD-2910, is far superior, its a good unit vs. bad unit thing! Good luck if you purchase!"
5,I love this movie,I had seen this movie in the past and wanted a copy of our own. Even though it was set in a different time and place it is timeless. The expressions on Lucy and Ricky's face going up the mountain is priceless. The scenery and beautiful colors are amazing. Diffently a keeper.
5,GREAT MOVIE! (also Heath Mcewan look),"""The Long, Long Trailer"" is one of my favorite movies. (Not just Lucille Ball movies.) This is a WONDERFUL movie! Great acting. I think everyone should have it!-CONTRACTIONS-You mean ISN'T and AREN'T not IS'NT and ARE'NT!"
4,Lucy and Desi are great but it was missing something.,"Lucy and Desi are great as always, but this film needed something. I thought I was going to sceam if I heard ""trailer brakes"" one more time. The situations seemed to be the same through out the movie. I'd definately give this movie a chance, but it's not one of the best."
2,Cute but STILL short!!!!!,"O.K. I haven't seen the DVD - I don't need to unfortunately. It is the same shortened version - based on the issuers own data- that has been running around since the original version (don't believe me, check IMDB - film was released at 103 minutes - TV, re-issues, Laserdisc, VHS and now the DVD are all 96 minutes - that's seven minutes gone - and I don't buy cut down films.) Hopefully it will someday be released in a correct version (all release footage at a minimum) but this is NOT it!!!"
3,the start of gangsta rap,"Yeah this was the start of gangsta rap but it wasnt really that great. Dont get me wrong i like NWA but i think they did a lot better on their own. get the solo albums by dr dre eazy e and ice cube 1st. Oh yeah and mr oxford lawyer is a snobby rich a** fool, 1st off how can u think dr dre is an actual doctor, 2nd u a lawyer n u help out terrible ""white collar"" criminals who are rich outta their minds but steal milions of dollars anyway and get away wit it, 3rd of all NWA stealled cuz they needed money n said f**K the police cuz the police treated them n all black people unfairly jus like you lawyers. PS will smith sux his music is pointless."
1,Rated PG for Pure Garbage,"This piece of ignorant trash single-handedly ruined rap music, misled a generation, and destroyed the hip hop culture. These five fakers exploited the pathology of ghetto culture that NONE of them really lived in, and brainwashed many impressionalbe young people (many whom I've mentored at my job) who had no one else in their homes or hoods to teach them any better,into thinking that gang life, violence, and disrespecting women were cool! Thanks, NWA, for making a bad situation worse while laughing all the way to the bank! May hell be your next spot and may your CD's be used for skeet shooting!"
5,HOTTT!!!!!!!,This album rocks. It is by far the best hip hop album ever. It may be offending to you with their life like content and explicit lyrics. But they really keep it real on this album
3,too short,Well first i have to say Amazon delivered fast as always =). I love Amazon =). Back to Cali season 4 though.... I don't know what it is with this show but the seasons are WAY too short. Show time is just sucking the money out of people who like the show. They basically turned 1 season into two by making it 12 episodes per season. That's why I've turned to watching Fringe where you get a nice helping of like 20-24 seasons per episode and I feel that's worth my money. So since i feel like Californication season 4 didn't improve I don't know if I'd buy a season 5 if they make one.
1,Don't buy this!!!!!!!,This is a deceptive title that will disappoint anyone let alone Kinks fans.I can't imagine in my wildest dreams that Ray would have participated in this.Perhaps someone can make Ray aware of this so that he can take the proper action to order a cease & desist..
3,Diplomatic intrigue ......,"This is a fairly scholarly work. Although it is not overly long, and it does allow a reader that is less well informed on the Elizabethan period to get a feel for the politics of the period, the book is not so dramatic as to be compelling to the average reader, and would be better suited to large institutional collections and those with a particular interest in Elizabethan England.Bossy writes in an erudite style, and appears to have attempted a more novelistic style for the structure of the book, but the nature of the book remains unchanged, and unfortunately, the literary gymnastics seem to reduce clarity in the account.Still a good book for interested parties."
3,Great movie but poor tape quality though... Want on DVD!!!,"I had to return the VHS 2 times at the K Mart in my town to get one with the best quality.. This is a great video where Alvin gets the wrong idea that his grandpa was the original Easter ""chipmunk"". He goes on shows that spoof Court TV and Sally Jessy Raphiel!Alvin thinks that the Easter Bunny sold out when the Easter Bunny asked for more money for Bunny Cantral! The only ptoblem is that the song in the cartoon was not done all the way through... We only hear snippets of it...Still... I liked the special.. The Animation was great! The colors were vibrent and much care went into making the show... I want this on DVD...Great show but 3 stars for video quality...."
1,Needs a Warning Label,"Somewhere in the product description there should have been a mention of the fact that this is a regeon 2 disc. ""House of Dracula"" isn't, for reasons known only to Universal, available in the the U.S. It is the ONLY entry in the Frankenstein/Dracula/Wolfman series you can't buy in regeon 1 format. For the record, I LOVE the Universal monsters and this, the last serious entry in the afore mentioned series."
4,Beverly,Appreciate the prompt shipment and service. Enjoying the book also.Thank you. Glad you still had a copy as I believe it is out of print now.
4,An excellent glimpse into the workings of Pakistani culture.,"This part of the world has exploded into news in recent times. If you have a young person who is trying to understand the culture of Pakistan, this is a good place to start. The story of the marriage of a young nomad girl who was forced to marry a wealthy landowner in order to settle a family feud, this book gives a glimpse into many layers of Pakistani culture. This book especially illuminates the role of women in that society. I would suggest reading ""Shabanu"" first to get the beginning of the story in more detail, but it isn't essential."
3,good,My husband really likes the hot sauce. My only complaint is the size of bottles sent were not the ones displayed.
2,Poor quality steel,"While this does have a nice variety, the quality of the steel is terrible. The first few phillips bits I used quickly snapped at the heads, after that I just figured that I'd wasted 30$. However, I did manage to salvage the bits by makeshift heat treating them using a torch to get them red hot and then submerging them in used motor oil. This made them much better than they were but still nothing to brag about.Experience level in relation to this tool: medium-high"
2,wrong item,"Buyer beware!They listed 20 -Pack set,which they don't carry,and send you 16-Pack instead.Now I need waist my time to return this item in order toget my money back.Customer service awful - they just don't care.If it's yourmistake - show your class, just send me missing 4 bits!No,they don't wantto do it.What a shame."
5,A most comprehensive Russian grammar,"This reference book thoroughly explains the structure and function of all the parts of speech, while providing examples in idiomatic Russian accompanied by English translation. The only drawback, which is most unfortunate, is that, although the exercises comprise a significant part of the book, there is no answer key to check your work."
2,Looking,This book was about the author not about the subject. It is too long and repeats and repeats the same content.
1,poorly made,"I want to love this dollhouse because I love the design, but it is poorly made. The first we received had a warped floorboard which would not sit correctly, making it impossible to assemble the house. The replacement we received had a floorboard that was only slightly less warped, so we could assemble the house, but it was just warped enough that the sliding partitions won't stay in the tracks. The glue holding the walls and stairs together is weak, and both walls and the stairs have fallen apart. One of the plexiglass skylights has cracked. My sons rarely, if ever play with the dollhouse and it is still falling apart."
3,It's still Who!!,"Yes there are no monsters. But who cares!! Doctor Who used to do historical episodes, and this seems to be an attempt by John Nathan Turner to bring back the historical episodes(that and most likely to save money, as the budget for this show was ridiculously LOW!). The episode is a lot of fun, despite it being a tad cliched. What is especially nice is to see the comaraderie between the tardis crew which was lacking in many of this Doctor's episodes, since everyone in the crew seemed to always be at each others throats. The sets are splendid, and the plot is engaging. It is a good Davison episode, and his charm shines through. Definitely worth a watch"
3,Quality but didn't fit,Look nice do have dark blue flowers in with black and white. I have an older truck bucket seats (97 Nissan) seat covers were way too big. I am dissapointed they were nice covers. Amazon sent me return label no problem.
4,Good pocket size reference.,"This is a handy pocket size dictionary of Spanish synonyms and antonyms. It has a wide variety of words and an extensive selection of synonyms and antonyms, which gives the student, reader or researcher an ample choice of alternate vocabulary. It does give reference to figurative and familiar usage and where possible countries where the particular word or words are used. The dictionary does not give examples of usage in sentence, which is vital to ensure that the reader understands how to use the word in the proper context. I would recommend this dictionary to strong intermediate students, advanced students, Spanish professionals and those who are pursuing independent study in Spanish. Overall, it's a handy reference and you will definitely expand your vocabulary by using it."
4,Good dictionary!,"It's a nice dictionary. The characters are pretty tiny, but despite the amount of words and the respective translations, it's fine."
2,never received,"placed an order for 2 normal bottles of 104 regular octane boost for wich i have tried with good results but part of the package is missing. 1 item is missing anyway the 104 max octane single bottle i had ordered was not in the box. box contained 2 reg 104 octane boost, 4 gunk octane boost, 1 can of seafoam and the most exspensive item ordered being the 104 max was not present in pkg. its labeled to be in there but am half wondering wether it will show up in a pkg at a later timeframe because of availabilty issues at shipment time. or wether i just got ripped off!!! will wait another week at most and contact customer service.never received item!!!!!!"
5,An Inspiring Read,After reading Ape House by Sara Gruen I was trapped and when she recommended Kanzi I ordered it from Amazon and found it to be absolutely awesome. After reading both books it is hard to think of a Bonobo as an animal and not one of us. The work that has been accomplished with the Bonobo and Chimps and how they have taken this knowledge and used it to help challenged individuals to be come productive human beings is awesome. Makes me wish I was 50 years younger and starting over in a career. It is a wonderful read.
5,worth every penny,"Since there's very little on TV these daya, my wife and I watch one episode of ""Rescue Me"" every evening. This multi-DVD package is worth every penny."
1,unhappy,Rescue me is my husbands and my favorite show but season one that we bought from amazon has several episode that skip due to bad data on the disk. We are very upset about this. Sadly this is not the first bad experience we have had with amazon.
5,angels x 3,we liked all of the episodes however the last show was a revisit of third season shows and since we had just finished seeing the whole season over a week time it was unnecessary
5,Love it!!,It's been one of my favorite shows of all time. I had to have it for my collection. I love it!!!!
5,Well Made Quality Filter,"This filter fits my Landover DISC II perfect, even better than the OEM filter. It is very nicely crafted (Made in Germany) and not like those cheaply made in China kinds. And it is reasonably priced as well. FRAM does not carry DISC II air filter. (You can't find it at Walmart.) However, not all filters from MANN FILTER brand are made in Germany. Many of them are made in China, depending on what types of vehicles."
5,After the Earthquake,"When Olivia Davidson and Ronnie Dies. The Twins look around to see and remember which of their hangouts has been saved or destroyed. Dari Burger-Destroyed,Miller's Point-Destroyed,Sweet Valley Mall with Caseys-Saved,El Carro High-Destroyed,Sweet Valley High-Saved,Mata Haris-Destroyed, Chez Sam-Destroyed ,Elizabeth tries to think about who's the one who saved her. something about a electric Snake. The Wakefield Family move in with The Fowlers,They have both saved their Diaries. Sam's Helmet and Christian's Surfboard is what Jessica Saved. Elizabeth saved her Cheerleading trophy,and I forgot what else. Devon took publicity for saving everyone in the earthquake. Jessica feels sad that the little girl she tried to save Alyssa,died. At the funeral,Ken,Roger,James and other of Olivia's boyfriends talk about her. I wish her parents had another child.Why didn't she have brothers and sisters!"
1,JUST DON'T DO IT,"This is a real piece of crap. I think it was 20 bucks when I ordered it.Well after a few jobs it decided to finally give out.The ball that keeps the bits secured to the screwdriver came out so I can no longer use any bits and hope that they stay put.Also, just as a flaw of design... the lock to keep the head in the various swiveled angles comes loose with about 2 turns of the screwdriver. It becomes very annoying to have to re-tighten it over and over again while tightening one screw.Do yourself a favor, don't look for bargains on tools. At the least don't look for bargain tools that have too many moving parts."
1,"Poor quality, doesn't last","I had a similar problem as one of the other reviewers. Within a couple months of mild use, the ball bearing that holds the bit in place fell out. Losing that ball bearing essentially makes the tool useless because the bits fall out so easily that I can't use the tool in any angle other than by holding the tool completely upright. It's just not practical. Stay away, and find a tool with better quality."
4,Highly recommended if you don't understand Derrida,"This book makes Derrida easy. They use many funny and interesting illustrations to help get the thought across. There are no chapters per se, but rather everything flows smoothly in a sort of dialogue, as if you were having a real conversation. I highly recommend this if you want to understand what Derrida was trying to say, especially if you are less familiar with the continental tradition."
5,An Excellent Beginning!,"Before I read this book, all I ever hear of Derrida is that he is so hard to read. Upon reading this, I realized where this could be true. This beginners book is very well written and made Derrida's work simple to understand. Although one may need a basic knowledge in linguistics and Sassure, one does not need it all together to comprehend some of Derrida's work. Author Jim Powell gives a concise look into the dense writings of the linguist which I not only found easy, but exciting - enough to make me want to go out and read some of the material that is written about. Along with an explanation of Derrida's work is also a brief biography which gives on an idea where he is coming from. Highly reccomended! One of the best beginners book to date."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this book,"This book reeks. It's poorly written, and organized so badly I was tearing my hair out after the first few chapters.Buy ""X Toolkit Cookbook"" - it's so much better, it defies description."
3,"Hawkwind - 'Spirit Of The Age,Part 2' (Voiceprint) CD single","Never have been a big fan of CD singles. I mean, what's the point? Unless the label perhaps makes it like a maxi-single and makes the duration of at least twenty minutes. The music of this 2-track CD single is good.""Spirit Of The Age"" was done with three long-time crew members, founder Dave Brock, Alan Davey and drummer (since '88 now)Richard Chadwick, with guest vocalist Mathew Wright. Well done. Then there's the re-working of a tune that comes off their landmark 'Hall Of The Mountain Grill' lp, a 2005 remix of ""Paradox"". True Hawkfans, rejoice!"
5,Great!,"The book is full of great recipes and techniques. Ideal for the beginning cook. Wonderful for anyone who doesn't know how to cook Japanese food but wants to learn how. I haven't cooked a single meal from this book that has not been a hit. The only hard part is finding some of the ingredients. The book is incredibly authentic, yet easy to understand and approachable. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Japanese food."
4,great brakes,"Been using these for a few months now. Good stopping power, work well. I use these on a commuter so and they perform in the wet and on the street well. Cannot speak to off-road use."
1,Squeal like stuck pigs.,"Could not make these things stop squealing. Took the bike to the shop and the mechanic could not make them stop squealing. Returned them for another brand and now all is well.The problem with these is they do not use the standard cup washers to allow adjusting toe in/out. So if they happen to fit your arrangement perfectly, you are in. If not, you are SOL. I've used different Koolstops on my road bike and my experience has been that they are superb pads. This particular model, unfortunately, would not work for me. So I have to give it one star. Your mileage may vary."
1,definitely NOT a good book!,"I don't think this is a good book. I have compared this book with other shell programming books and and found this book is not good at all. So when I need to refer a shell script book I would not use this one. Besieds, the author is really careless, this book contains a lot of errors.when I wrote this review, I found there are altogether 14 reviews already. Seems some of the reviewers had the same feeling toward this book as me."
3,[Three and a half stars] Garrison fiction but based on JFK Assassination,"Late, former New Orlean Circuit JudgeJim Garrison did bang up work here aswell in his magisterial On The TrailOf The Assassins. Keep this book on thesame shelf as Plausible Denial, Rush ToJudgement, Fletcher Prouty's JFK and BoGritz 'Called To Serve'."
4,The Newton Boys,The reason I bought this is that I was from a small town in the book and heard of the bank robbery over the years. I enjoyed the book as well as the movie. The Newton gang were just good ole boys until they turned robbers. Good true story.
3,Just ok,The enamel on this product was chipped when I got it. That and it's really hard to keep clean. Probably going to be spray painting it this year.N
3,neccessary nuisance,"With the mulching mower, I don't use the grasscatcher very often. I cut the grass every five or six days."
3,"Easy to use, pitty about the zipper","This bag is nice and easy to attach to the mower, but when emptying the bag, the zippers have a tendency to get caught under the hardened base of the bag, making it difficult to close the zipper when you are done."
3,Black & Decker Side Bag Assembly #BA-075,"Black & Decker Side Bag Assembly #BA-075 - Big and bulky - Would be good for large lawns, not for the typical ones around a Chicago home."
4,"Mostly, good","For the most part, this is a great bag assembly, tough, and easy to dump. HOW-EVER...it is on the small side and has to be dumped often, particularly when cutting more than an inch. When its full it fills about 1/2 of a garbage bag. For my small, shallow yard (about 20 x 40), I have to empty it about 2-5 times depending on how long the grass is. Not hard, but inconvenient. But its very durable!"
1,A waste of money,"This side bag style grass catcher just flat out doesnt work. In the first place, its slightly awkward to use with the mower. Second, it clogs very easily. I tried this bag on two different occasions. First, at the beginning of summer when the grass was a little longer. It clogged on first few strips of grass I mowed. I emptied the bag and made several other attempts to use it. Every time, the small opening clogged. I tried again when the grass was shorter and completely dry with the same results. Don't buy it! Save your money, and just rake your lawn. In the long run you will do a alittle more work, but with a lot less fruastration than trying to get this to work"
4,So far so good,"Although I haven't had a chance to use this product, it fit easily and seemlessly into the intended slot. It looks solid enough and appears durable."
2,Zipper not sturdy enough,"I bought this bag a month ago after relying on the mulcher feature of my mower for 2 years. The bag is easy to put on and take off the mower, and does a good job catching grass, though it could be a little bit larger. However, the zippers on this bag are pretty worthless. After 4 uses, one of the two zippers is already broken. Having read other reviews citing problems with the zippers, I was pretty careful with them, but to no avail. Now this month-old product has one working zipper. It would be nice if Black and Decker would put heavy duty zippers on this product! I will also be writing to Amazon and Black and Decker seeking a replacement bag."
3,leaf vacuum?,"Today I tried using my mower as a yard vacuum to pick up leaves. The system worked fine but the limiting factor is the bag capacity. Unless you have a small yard or only a few leaves the bag fills quickly and necessitates constant emptying. This would also be a problem with lots of high grass. Otherwise it works fine. The bag is easy to mount, remove, and empty."
3,eh,its alright. i thought they were crazier than this. songs become predictable.. there's only one song i really enjoy listening to on this album. other bands have definitely caught up to what fassw used to be.
5,Beautiful book!,I absolutely loved this book. It made me laugh and cry and I can't wait for her second novel! I used to work with autistic children and it was heartwrenching to see what it is like for the family of an autistic child. I learned so much even though I've been a special ed teacher for over twenty years. Really a wonderful novel.
1,No heat,"The Magnetic heater was purchased for a Ford tractor 3000 oil pan, but is does'nt even keep the oil warm at all. Waste of money !!!!!!!!!"
4,Brings back good memories!!,"This book was a truly interesting trip down memory lane. Although it was set well before my time, I was raised around Ranger and Comanche and related easily to much of the setting and situations. I would recommend it to anyone who spent time around small Texas towns and the fever that grips them during Football season."
5,Kolyma Tales: Powerful tales of the GULag,"Kolyma Tales is one of the most important sets of Russian short stories of this century. Varlam Shalamov, the author, provides a searing look at life in Stalin's forced labor system. The stories are well-translated by John Glad, who brings a greater audience to this extremely important 20th century Russian writer. This book outstrips Solzhenitsyn's ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"" in its ability to show the reader the true horror of the GULag. Shalamov creates a narrator who, although outwardly neutral, reveals the full pathos of a system that killed millions of people, not deliberately, but through its complete indifference to their fate. These stories will linger and stay with a reader for years to come. We can only hope that with the destruction of the Soviet Union, more great writers like Shalamov whose work was silenced will be brought out into the open"
4,Fun little toys,Fun toy for kids especially if they like to watch the real garbage trucks on trash day. One criticism is that the rubber tires split and can fall off but I have been able to fix with some glue. The road sweeper attachment can get stuck when trying to push the truck around on carpet but all in all a fun toy for kids.
3,Really 100 piece set!,"It comes with 35 electrical terminals and 100 fasteners as part of the kit. So it really comes with 99 tools and the box.It was inexpensive and if you're not looking to do a lot of repair work on your car, it's probably a good buy for you. Something to keep in your trunk. I can tell already though from looking at this, that I'm going to want to get REAL set elsewhere. For basic maintenance work this set will do.."
2,Horrible Audio,"I have never written a review but after seeing all the raves about this phone I thought it would be wrong for me to not speak up. Yes it is a very cute phone, yes it tiny. The pictures and video are alot of fun but if you are buying a phone to actually talk to someone, stay away from this one. The sound quality was horrible, even worse if calling other sprint cell phones. The best way to describe it, is it sounds like you are in a tunnel. The phone was exchanged for the Sanyo 8200 and what a world of difference in sound quality. I know others say they love this phone, I wish I could have said the same."
5,I know the setting by heart,"This was definately a good read. The whole book had all the elements of comedy, suspense, romance, and mystery. Nate's blend of words made the book unique like himself. You can wonder on how much each character resembles the author. Alter egos? I think you can relate to all of the characters on some level. The relationships that the character had with each other seemed to be a page from my life. I enjoyed this book all the way from the crazy cult to the three squirrels and i recommend this to anyone who has a craving for campy woods stories and the role crazy people and friends have in common."
5,What took so long?,I watched this program as a kid. It is still as good as it was back then. Well-written scripts and interesting story lines. We need more shows like this now. I just don't know why they took so long getting it on DVD.
1,A profound waste of money,"I had heard a single from Dysrhythmia from a different source and was blown away by the richness of the recording quality and by what a tight unit the band is given the off time signatures they employ. So, I took a chance on ""Pretest"" but found it, however, to be the stark opposite-- a garbled mess of directionless ""song"" writing, unlistenably dissonant chord structures, poorly executed rhythm changes, and generally misappropriated recording studio rental fees. I sold it the same day I bought it."
1,No grommet holes as shown in photo and as is required for safe driving.,The delivered floor mats did not have the required 2 grommet holes in the driver's side mat. The photo shows 2 grommet holes and it is required for safe driving. I returned the mats the same day that I got them.
5,Cheb Mami is the BEST!,Being that I am 1/2 Algerian- I have heard Rai but I have never loved it until I heard the sweet voice of Cheb Mami- it is beautiful and powerful. He has amzing talent and I would love to see him tour the US. I am asking for Meli Meli for my upcoming 14th birthday. He is great!
1,Piece of crap,"I would not advise anyone to purchase this item. It was poorly made for it does not do what it was intended to do. It is unreliable, mostly does not work. It is worthless as it does not burn anything."
5,Great,My grandfather loves Fog horn leg horn lol and this is the only one I found with alot of his cartoons
3,"Didnt see the ""& Friends"" on cover until I watched it, dont buy","I should have caught the wording ""& Friends"".But I did not.9 of the 15 were forhorn leghorn.The rest were not.I would NOT have bought it if I saw and Friends.The 9 with Froghorn were great.Its the other 6.Roger"
5,cartoon fan,Big fan of Looney Tunes and favorite is Foghorn Leghorn. The rooster knows his stuff and how to strut it. If you love Foghorn Leghorn then you'll love this one. The majority of the cartoons are Foghorn Leghorn and they are pretty funny. It was well worth the purchase and as usual Amazon is great.
5,"A ""MUST"" read for advanced players","This is the second Volume of Advanced Backgammon by Robertie, which takes the reader through the Technical part of the game (ace-point games, back-games, bear-off etc. etc) with clear, easy to understand effective examples and analysis. I would definately include this book in the ""Classic Backgammon Collection"" together with the First Volume, Positional Play, Magriel's ""Backgammon"", Cooke's ""Paradoxes and Probabilities"" and few others. Many concepts are re-proposed with lighter analitical developments in ""501 Essential BG Problems"" although often in different keys."
3,the picture movement in this dvd is broken,"unlike all the other seasons thet i bought,when i play this dvd the picture doesnt move clear it moves really in broken way disturbing to the eyes and driving them crazy- this is why i gave only 3 stars.the 3 stars are for this great season which seinfeld isnt complete without it since every season in seinfeld has a background plot(the show isnt exactly about nothing)-this seaon is about past suzanne ross death and the foundation that created for her and george was involved in it.in seaon 5 george doesnt have a job all the season and in season 6 elain doesnt have job. unlike other seasons this season is much more slow and serious and u can feel the show grown up and that the characters are well developed."
4,starting to get a little tired,"At their worst, the Seinfeld team is still tops in TV history, but this season is not their best. The death of George's fiancée started a trend of really black humor that is often in rather bad taste. But every episode remains worth watching."
5,As humorous as any other season,"Many reviewers downgrade this season, for a variety of reasons: Larry David's absence; the over-the-top nature of many of the episodes as well as the seeming obsession with having as many individual plot strands per episode as possible; the too-self-aware-for-its-own-good nature of the show at this point in its history. While these are all valid points, nonetheless, having watched this season recently, it made me laugh as much as any other. Maybe we're in danger of focussing on the trees and missing the forest - despite all the negatives, Seinfeld remained, and still remains, absolutely hilarious. How many other shows from the 90s bear rewatching now, and manage to retain the charm and humour they had at the time? Very few, it seems to me. There is a timelessness in this show that makes it a gem. Highly recommended."
3,Easy Tractor Repair,"Thanks to Lowe's I knew ahead of time that my lawn tractor needed a solenoid. Did online searches, found best price from Amazon and ordered. Had it on time and it was easy to install."
1,What a mistake,"This book is deceptively titled. It gives no inklng of the density of the math involved. It should properly be titled ""A rigorous mathematical treatment of the Aerodynamics ..."" I doubt I could have followed this back when I was immersed in physics and engineering courses in college. I certainly bounced right off of it 15 years later. This book should not even be available outside of University Bookstores' Engineering sections. There is simply no point in anyone else buying it."
2,FRENCH! I bought this. The cover is in English. I didn't read carefully that it is in FRENCH! :(,"Love Chanel, love Lagerfeld, this FRENCH movie is dull. Buy the Valentino movie and the Isaac Mizrahi movie instead."
1,Something wierd about this product,"OK, I'm in the camp that can't get this thing to install. Blue Screen of Death/Reboot on THREE different computers - both a laptop and 2 desktop machines, all with completely latest updated Windows XP. And I'm an extreme expert on computers and software, so I tried all the tricks without success.But some of the reviewers actually can get a picture. I'd love to get that far. But it is weird, because it wouldn't work on three different machines. All used nVidia graphics boards, so perhaps that is the issue?So maybe it will work for you, and maybe it won't."
2,This only works for Analog TV,"I was going to buy this but after looking at all the trouble reported here, I went to the manufacturer's website. It states ""Watch and record your favorite NTSC Analog TV station, where available; in the United States, this feature is limited mostly to Cable and Satellite since over-the-air broadcasting has migrated to ATSC Digital (see Sabrent model TV-USBHD)."" Not much use in the US for TV reception or recording unless you still have access to a cable system that carries analog signals."
2,Have not been able to put it to work with Windows 7 32-bit,"Hello,I bought two of these, one of them works fine under Windows XP (although the remote only allows to switch from full screen to windows screen and you can only change channels by using the numeric pad..you cannot move backward or forward..) I tried to put the other one to work with my laptop that was running Windows 7-64 bit Professional, but, although I contact the vendor's customer support by email, the options that they gave me didn't work.So, I decided to try with another laptop that I have with Windows 7-32 bit, but the device cannot work with the drivers provided..not even with the ones that can be downloaded from the vendor's site nor the ones that customer support sent me by e-mail.Unfortunately, I have not been able to enjoy this product under Windows 7 and I have the product stored on my closet meanwhile.Thanks,Allan."
3,"Not the best, but it works","This TV tuner isn't the best you can find, but it does its job. You get what you pay for is what I am trying to get at. It records what you want and the mobility of a USB 2.0 tuner sure beats having to place it into a PCI slot in a PC. It doesn't have HD capabilities, so I am personally deeming this tuner obsolete to today's standards, but if Standard Definition is good enough for you, this tuner is at best a lukewarm deal. Suggest you fork over an extra 25 dollars and get a TV tuner with HD, at least 720p."
1,Only worked for a week,"The tuner worked fine for about a week, then I started getting a message about a ""USB power surge"" whenever I connected it to my desktop. If I connect it to the laptop, the laptop just shuts down as if the battery had been removed."
4,"Record TV shows like Tivo, edit and save shows",This was very easy to install and worked very well.I recommend this for anyone who would like to record tv / other video sources. Price is very good.
3,A little buggy,"It is ok for the price you are paying but dont expect great picture quality, it also has some bugs but all and all for the price i would say it is worth it"
5,ADDICTIVE. When do we get more?,"I assume you already have watched Series 1-3. Since Amazon does not give the summary for Series 4, here it is:""In Series 4, Police Inspector Corrado Cattani finds himself up against the ruthless Tano Carridi, who with the help of a corrupt senator plans to take control of a major international conglomerate. Cattani joins forces with Judge Silvia Conti in a desperate attempt to foil the Mafia takeover, but danger lurks around every corner. This time, will Cattani go to far?""Warning: Compared with Series 1 and 2, there is a moderate increase in sex and violence in Series 3 and 4. In Series 1 and 2 you just got to see the woman buttoning her blouse ""afterwards""; now you get half a rape scene (top half only) and some breasts. The bad guys also use more bullets to kill, with the same result."
4,some good songs,"I like having this cause I have their first one and business never personal, the one with boondox, but it is not as good."
4,epmd,"old school hip hoppers epmd release a classic cd.the gem of this cd is ""so watcha saying"" but the other songs are decent.this cd came out in 89 and it shows by the beats and rhymes but hip hop purists will enjoy this album in their collection."
1,I hate subtitles,"I hate subtitles! They are too distracting, and I sent these DVDs back to Amazon. I was also disappointed that they did not star Kenneth Brannagh. I want to watch a film, not read it."
3,Not as good as I was expecting but tolerable...,"I've heard a great deal of hype about PD James, but I was disappointed in this one. The details are a little muddled, there is a strange and unexplained transition in the inspector's investigation towards the end of the book, and the writing itself is not engaging. Agatha Christie at her weakest is better than this. Still, it's somewhat of a page-turner and I will be reading another PD James book soon just to give her another chance. James has the right idea with this plot but just doesn't carry it off somehow."
4,Excellent,"P.D. James has the maestry of writing novels with great suspense, much intrigue and his efficient Dagliesh, who for me, is the investigator of the present days. Clear, always studying the suspects and facts around the crime. In this case, the crime in an psichiatric clinic, turns to put you in the scene of the crime as you were Dagliesh himself. Great novel."
4,essential items for hands on owners of the original Fiat 500,This is a very good step by step guide with a lot of illustrations and some photos. all of the essential gap and tolerance information is in there. Not as good as the old (long out of print) UK Haynes workshop manual this book will still help you tackle jobs without having to figure things out after you remove parts!
4,Bought this for a friend who loved it,"My best friend recently got married, and instead of giving her a traditional bridal shower gift, I gave her a gift bag with a bunch of different stuff, including a travel book for their honeymoon and this CD. I only listened to part of it one time in her car, but she has mentioned several times that she hasn't taken it out of the CD player since I gave it to her months ago. I figure that's a good sign!"
4,Niv Gift Bible review,This Bible is great. I love the feel of the leather nad the craftsmanship is awesome. The text is the regular size text. Since I were glasses I should have gotten the large text but I still like my new bible.
5,Beautiful Bible,"I bought this Bible to take to my seminary classes with me. It arrived a few days ago, & I am very pleased with it. The cover & dedication page are lovely. It also has a pale pink ribbon to mark your place. The font is small, but not unreadable. The paper is not thin or fragile like onion skin, instead it is more like thin office paper. This makes it much easier to write notes in the Bible & to turn the pages without damaging them. In the back of the Bible there is a chart of weights & measures & the following section of ""Bible Study Helps"": Overview of the Bible, Teachings of Jesus, Ministry of Jesus, Miracles of Jesus, Parables of Jesus, Life in New Testament Times, & Dictionary. Although there are footnotes throughout the Bible, there are no cross-references or maps. I can not comment on how this Bible will hold up to use, as I have not had it long. It looks great, feels great (the brown leather is soft), is a great value for the price & would make a great gift."
3,Animation better than other 60s' Marvel cartoons,"Of all the Marvel cartoons of the 1960s' obviously most of the effort was put into Spider-Man. The other Marvel cartoons; Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, etc. were lifted from now classic silver age comics. The animation of these cartoons is crude to say the least, but the story, dialogue and voice talent is top notch. Spider-Man's stories are all original animation adapted loosely from the comic stories. The story telling comes across as slightly 'hipper' (by late 60s' standards), and there is a lot of filler in the origin story. After all Spidey's origin in Amazing Fantasy #15, did not take-up the entire issue. Although Fox could have fit more than 2 episodes on a VHS tape, I would still recommend this video to anyone who is a comic book fan or Saturday morning cartoon buff."
4,Spidey Rules!,"Not really being a big fan of cartoons, Spiderman is a rare exception. Even though the animation isn't ""Walt Disney"" quality, it is still very enjoyable to watch. The only criticism, which has been mentioned before in other reviews, is that the tape is too short. It would have been nice to have 8 episodes on a 2 hr tape instead of just 2 episodes making it only have a runtime of 35 minutes. 20th Century did a nice job on the clamshell case and the artwork. Also, offering it in SP mode, and not in EP, like most of the tapes of TV shows seem to be recorded in, was nice too. Even though the tape isn't that long, it's still worth the money to have as a keepsake for fans of Spiderman."
2,Does not play nice with other software.,"I realized soon after getting this otherwise great product that it disables Windows' ability to idle and enter sleep mode or activate the screensaver. This is a known issue according to Microsoft, and they claim they are working on it. The problem is that other services running, including PCMService which is a critical part of Dell Media Experience, conflict with MS's Intellipoint software. If you disable this (or a host of other possible culprits) using MSCONFIG, the problem will go away. Unfortunately, disabling one service to make another work is not a reasonable option for most users. This is just another problem that MS admits but is unwilling to come up with a solution. Sound familiar? I hate to give up the nice performance of this mouse, but it looks like I'm returning it for a Logitech... Time to sell MS stock again and buy some Logitech..."
2,Flawed mouse,"My previous mouse broke, so I had to use this mouse temporarily. I play a lot of games on my PC, so mouse precision is vital for success.Pros: Great ""feel"" - fits my hand perfectly. Side buttons are well placed. Slides pretty smoothly. I even like its look.Cons: It's a wireless mouse, so it needs batteries. This particular wireless mouse goes through batteries quite quickly. This mouse has horrible accuracy. It basically requires a good mouse pad, and even then I can see my cursor jump and stop when I move my mouse in a single direction, even right now. This not only makes it hard to game, but it makes it hard to, say, edit a certain letter in a Word document.If you want a mouse to browse facebook, watch netflix and watch youtube, sure, buy this. If you want to do anything else, I would not recommend this mouse. You get what you pay for, I guess."
4,Good Mouse,This mouse is every effective for the price. It has a very sustainable battery life. I have had it for over a year now and I only have to charge the rechargeable batteries I use in it every 2-3 weeks even with heavy use. I gamed heavily with this mouse and it was very consistent and accurate even after running it through enduring sessions. Very worth the price tag. It is also very comfortable and the thumb buttons can be useful if you adjust your mousing technique. Overall a good product.
2,Short Life,OK mouse but right click stopped registering after awhile. Tried everything including reinstalling software until I finally tried another wireless mouse my son lent me and voila...my right click was back. Poor lifespan...and not worth fixing.
1,A mouse which can't click,"I've also experienced the ""click problem,"" where clicking the mouse button repeatedly doesn't do anything. This incredibly annoying problem appeared only one week after purchasing the mouse. This mouse doesn't know how to click, and therefore it works best when you install it directly into your trash can."
1,Sony PS2 USB Keyboard.,"well, I received the item I ordered, plugged it in, it didn't work. so I thought, maybe bad connection, so I plugged it in to another unit, it still didn't work, so, I plugged in the keyboards I was using, they worked. I am not going to send the unit back as I have thrown it away in the trash..I don't want my money back or a credit because it was a cheap item anyway. Lesson learned, don't buy cheap stuff."
5,Happy baby,"This product came in good timing, in good shape and is a wonderful product. My little one LOVES to watch them. They are definitly worth while."
4,Broken,My daugher grabbed the 1st dvd on Cristmas and pulled it out of the package. It was in there so tightly that it broke. These kids dvd's are not for use by children!!!
4,For all fans of comic books and new fans,"This first episode of the 1996 cartoon tell us by flashback an up-dated origin of the Hulk. Instead of a gamma bomb(in the comic book) Dr Bruce Banner is working on a gamma reactor. Also, we see the origin of the""Leader"" Lou Ferrigno is back in the role of the Hulk (he does the voice). This series is better than the 1982 series. This series will have Banner travel country to country trying to find a cure (like the live-action series)."
5,Twisted!,"Hospitality is definitely the thinking person's thriller. Extremely insightful and witty-- the dialogue was absolutely riveting and the actor's well chosen and well rehearsed.Many times in real life there is no true or justifiable motive for the horrific events that occur and I was pleased, from a movie point of view, that this was also true in the movie.Kudos to the team and I certainly look forward to more thrillers in the near future."
2,good for 20 days,"Worked well for 20 days. Then it lost its ability to stay up, tension gone, and I can not bring it back"
5,Piggy Pie,"What a lovely review. My mother is June Talarczyk. She illustrated over 30 books for T.S. Denison when I was growing up. She and Jane Riley also combined their talent on ""The Little Seal With Meal Appeal"" (my personal favorite) and ""A Golden Christmas Jewel"". I showed her this page and she was overjoyed. June would be interested in hearing from anyone interested in her childrens books.You can contact June Talarczyk by mail at 37539 State Hwy. 13, Montgomery, MN 56069."
2,OK,I thought this book was a little over the top. This was the first book I read of Mr. Massey and it didn't really sell me. I will probably try another book of his before I make a final judgement. I love to write and Mr. Massey is inspirational. He is very passionate about his writing and I admire him for making his dream come true. I think the best is still to come with Mr. Massey.
1,Can it get wacker than this??,The fact that Ice Cube left N.W.A to make trash like this only speaks about his crediblity. He should just stay acting and stay off the music buisness.
2,One of his least memorable albums...,"Long time Ice Cube fan but I hated this album. Too much ""Kill Whitey"" stuff and the beats weren't as good this time around. AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted is still his best. The NWA dis track at the end is good though."
2,A disappointment for me,"I bought this book to learn JAVA audio by doing. The javax.media dependent code however isn't compiling under any of the SUN provided JAVA environments for PC. A running code though is crucial to the value of that book, DSP not being its strength. Well if somebody has more luck..."
5,Livin Hip-hop listening to Erick and Parrish,"It was 88' and I was at football practice. I was open by the ""It's my thing"" single and this cat(whose name I forgot) wanted to trade me my Long Live the Kane tape for his Strictly Business tape. Once our tranaction was made, little did I know that these cats were going to be my favorite duo of all time in hip hop. This album was so ahead of it's time. The tracks, the gun talk, stuntin chicks, I loved those dudes mayne. They made me buy my fisherman hat. I can't say enough how this album impacted me. It was so good that my mom used to take the tape with her to work sometimes.I miss those days..**sobs**"
5,Kid loved these,My son is just learning how to use silverware and loved these Cars fork and spoon. Perfect size for kids and durable.
4,Quality Cover,This is a very well made cover for jet ski. It is made of a thick material that was a perfect fit. Very impressed with this cover.
3,dvd,I bought this as a present for someone and I really don't have any opinion about its value.The dvd was received in a reasonable amount of time and well packaged.
4,When will America Wake up?,"Very well written book. It still amazes me that so many people support this administration. While I can't say if it is all true, we do know for a fact that Clinton is a liar. Therefore, I tend to believe most of what is written in this book. This book has the right title. We have been betrayed. Gertz points this out so vividly. Everyone should read this, then maybe the outrage would be more vivid. May God help us."
4,"A must read book, Gertz is an excellent journalist !",A must read it takes the hard facts and presents them with no sugar coating. Often these facts are ignored by the Whitehouse press corp for fear of loosing their access to the whitehouse.
1,"Terrible Writing, Editing and Fact Checking. Almost Fiction!","This book will appeal to the low brow conspirisy theory crowd who listen to the likes of Limbaugh or Alex Jones. Unfounded claims of security breaches and secrets sold will appease many of the right wing extremists who are a minority to the thinking majority. POORLY WRITTEN AND EDITED! If you want Conspiracy Fiction read Brad Steiger's 'Alien Rapture' which by the way, has more truth in it that this wasted paper."
1,"The book is not a book, just a rehash of trash.","This is a promo for the right wing's next attemtpt to impeach the President. The author has accessed a number of confidential reports, twists them and writes book of fairy tales and has the capacity to use the right-wing talk show circuit to publicize his trash."
5,Excellent book,"At least now we will understand why India tested a nuclear bomb -- it was to counteract China who was given a free pass to steal top secret US military tech in exchange for cheap ""markets"" and contributions to the DNC. It's no wonder why the Chinese said ""we like your president."""
4,"Andre Rieu DVD - ""Homecoming""","This performance, in his home town in Holland, is definitely one of Andre's best. The selected music, as well as the entertainment makes this DVD a worthwhile investment. The only negative observation about this production is the fact that the video has been cut and pasted and the conclusion of this performance does not happen at the end of the concert."
5,Broadcasters Review of Andre Rieu Video,I have been in the broadcast and music businessfor 35 years and the Andre Rieu video entitled'The Homecoming' is remarkable. It is well producedand the music appeals to almost any demographicgroup. It can be viewed over and over without fatigue!By Dave Fricker
5,Good yeast. Great on popcorn,This is such a great thing on popcorn and Bob's yeast is very good and comes in a reasonable size package. I was glad to find it!
3,Pedantic read,"This is a book I purchased for a class on sound design. It is boring and pedantic, and rather difficult to read. Since I have a strong science background, it was easier for me to read than some of my classmates. I would suggest reading it in small doses, as it's easier to understand that way."
2,arrived smashed w/debri inside case,"items case was broken,cracked on both sides. in the case i found broken pieces of plastic that did not seem to originate from this item. the cd had marks on the insiderks. dirt and wiping marks, even through it was sealed. swirling marks indicative of a cleaning machine were also evedent"
2,Rushed to print?,"I have used several Kaplan books to help prepare students for the SAT and AP exams. Most Kaplan books are contain good examples and excellent test taking advice.This book, however, seems to have been rushed to print. In the math sections alone, I found 21 typos / errors. These are not simple mistakes; these typos / errors affect the student's understanding of the problems and concepts.Perhaps the verbal and writing sections have fewer mistakes. I haven't checked those yet."
1,Too Violent and Scary!,"I downloaded this movie for my 4 year old daughter to watch - she was scared half to death! She was in the back seat, with my Kindle Fire mounted for her to watch it. I was on the freeway, and there was little I could do to get the images off for her! Even turning the sound down didn't help.Stay away from this scary, nightmare-inducing movie! The cover looks cute, but as they say... don't judge a movie by it's cover!"
5,A must read!,"While waiting to adopt our daugther from China, my husband and I read this book. It was by far one of the best books we've ever read and we would recommend it to anyone. It is a factual story of true faith...as the Bible says, ""the faith of a child"". As my husband was reading it and chuckling or shaking his head in disbelief at what he was reading, I couldn't stand the suspense and he'd read me an exerpt from it, after the first few nights, I'd come to bed only to ask him, ""so what's Jacelyn doing today"". Even after knowing the ending...which is great, I had to read it myself, and didn't want to put it down. He's now reading it a second time."
2,Doesn't Work with older Operating Systems,"I tried to use this with an Older computer that I have, which is running Windows ME. I know Windows ME sucks, but it also gives you a hard time when you try to upgrade. This is a second computer in my basement so it isn't worth the trouble. Anyway, check out which operating systems it will work with before you buy this product. I had to return it."
3,It's okay,No different than drug store aftershave smells nice wont go out of my way to buy again its a little pricey.
3,"Meh, clean and rather generic smell","Have had a 3.4oz bottle of this for over 4 years now and can't seem to get rid of it. I like AC products but their cologne is very generic smelling, to me at least. Nothing stands out, but to some that may be a good thing. This is a very non-invasive clean smelling cologne. I have way too many bottles of cologne and with most, I will do a spray on either side of my neck and maybe one on the wrist. This cologne takes a few more sprays to last. This has been relegated to my weekend yard work ""meh, gotta use it up"" pile...."
2,Nothing triumphant about these Pokémon wannabes,"Basically, I once thought that these guys would try to overtake Pokémon when they arrived in America last year. They did. Didn't work for me. Sorry."
1,Pass this one over,"I recently received this book as a present, and I can't recommend it to anyone. The author is a good writer, but there isn't a story here. Except for one chapter, the book is boring and I looked forward to finishing it. Do you self a favor and read something else."
5,Great for People with Dry Scalp,My three year old has eczema and had lost most of her hair due to the issue. I bought this product and the moisture balanced everything out and her scalp began to improve and produce hair!
2,Burckhardt's Least Known work,"Although I am a great fan of the author, I was disappointed to discover that Burckhardt's least known book is both dated and dull as a butter knife. While this tome may be useful to students of Arabic it is not the kind of book that most people would read for pleasure."
2,"No ""PLAY ALL"" option ??!!","I loved the Love Boat as a kid. And still enjoy watching.The 2 stars I gave are for the production of the dvd, not for the show.First of all, we've waited how long for Love Boat to come out on DVD, and they only give us half a season ( at full season pricing for many shows ).Then they offer NO bonuses, and worst of all, NO ""Play All""option ??!!Maddening........As can be seen on the discs themselves, they put absolutely NO thought or effort into this dvd production.I feel like I've been ripped off!"
2,Half seasons-I guess that's what you get.....,"...when the bulk of the cast went on to nothing else afterward. I suppose it could just be the studio, but I can only assume that the actors are looking for another payday too since none went on the anything very lucrative afterward. That's why a lot of these older shows get caught up in limbo, legal fights over royalties, and the way some of the contracts were written back then, one person can hold out for whatever they think they can get. Love Boat was a great show, but it had little to do with the actors. IF they are all looking for another payday for what they did thirty plus years ago, they can sink with the ship. Nobody is going to buy it for such a high price and they'll get nothing."
5,Great Fun,"I expected that this show would seem infantile since I hadn't seen it in 30 years. I was so wrong. The acting holds up, the stories are silly, but fun, and it really is a great escape. You're seeing stories about people that are on vacation, so it kind of feels like you're on vacation too. Perfect fluff after a difficult day, and a welcomed break from all the ""reality"" shows. I can't wait for the rest of them."
1,season .5,how many negative comments does it take to get a full season on dvd? ill bet forever. actually i give the production of this half season nonsense a zilch ...star-wise
1,I'm staying off this cruise,"Sorry, but for HALF a season I can't afford the price. I'll let the ship sail without me too, as others have said. I'd like as many as possible and won't be blackmailed into paying for half seasons. The Adventures of Superman combined the 3rd/4th and 5th/6th seasons because they were only 13 episodes each those years, Love Boat should try to do likewise. I realize with Superman that's only 13 hours each plus special features, but I don't think there are more than 15-20 Love Boats per year, so that's not THAT much longer."
4,My dear Elizabeth what have you don,Okay I admit It I like seeing Liz go slightly bad girl-ish. I would reccomend it to my younger friends. And has anybody noticed she has a sun burn on the cover. TTFN!
3,Over priced tips,Good Practical advice but pretty basic and not enough on fishing. A guy should have got most of these tips from and his dad or cranky uncle. I just expected more on fishing from a respectd angler for that price.
3,Ok for the price,"$10 ? Shipped free. Anytime. As mentionned in other review, size is rather large. Has served me well so far, machine washed, no degradation of color or texture."
3,Just bought it for the Kavalier and Clay story,"Sorry to be blunt but that was it. The story, in which Joe goes to Tommy's school and performs for the class was funny and light, even if it did read like a chapter cut from the rest of the book. As for the other stories I didn't even read them and can't tell you who they are (except for infamous JT Leroy who has a story here.)"
3,"Not what I expected, but I didn't know what to expect","I've never read anything by Hunter Thompson, but had heard about this book and of course about his suicide. I thought this book would be more about politics, and there was that, but there was also a lot of rambling about sports and gambling and Sean Penn. It was all interesting enough, but maybe a collection of ESPN.com columns is not where I should have started reading Dr Thompson's works. Nonetheless, I did find it diverting enough to read the whole thing. I feel like my horizons have been expanded just a bit, as this is not the sort of thing I usually read.Still, if you're a fan of his, you'll clearly enjoy this book, as evidenced by the glowing praise from other readers."
2,A Strategy for Creating Great Art,"More than a ""how to"" book, Dan McCaw's philosophy of ""painting from the heart"" may be obvious, but it is stated with compelling sincerity."
5,For managers - yes this is good,I agree with the previous reviewer. This a book for managers and would be a great help for descision makers in deciding how best to use PLC technology.This is not a techincal book per-se but I think should be in every system integrators library.I have found this to be great help as reference when talking to prsoective customers on best to implement an automation project. This is most serious weakness of most managers in the engineering world.Very good.5 stars - highly recommended
3,"WHERE ARE HUGH O'BRIAN, CLINT WALKER, AND WILLIAN SMITH?","I bought this recently since I love the old western series from the50'sand 60's that I grew up on. I enjoyed seeing the stars Iremembered, but whats with Alan(The Skipper)Hale Jr. and Dan(Grizzly Adams)Haggerty doing in it?? I was disappointed they didn'ttouch harder on the western series and its stars. It played morelike a variety show with useless saloon girl numbers, and the fewstars that spoke lines were obviously reading Q cards. This wouldhave been so much better if say Hugh O'Brian would of hosted andthey had just western stars from that TV western era. Glen Ford is a great western movie star, but Cade's County wasn't really a western from the 50's & 60's. I also saw Tony Young(Gunslinger), Henry Darrow & Mark Slade(High Charparral) who had no lines and nothing to do. William Smith should have been invited, Peter Brown & Neville Brand were there, but not for the Laredo series?? My score is 3 out of 5."
5,Children are people too!,"This book is about how to ""be"" with your children, instead of how to just deal with their behavior. It actually recognizes that children are people too! It's the first parenting book I've seen that gives one tools on how to ""be"" with our children that will help them grow to be responsibile, confident, self-actualizing youth and adults. Another plus of this book is it also is as much about the parent as it is about the child. Parents can get insite about their own behavior, ways of thinking and what their needs are. After all, parents are also people!"
3,If you are a professional...,"This book provides basic concepts in parenting that most professionals already know. It can be a useful resource to have when working with families because the basic concept is centered on communication. However, as a family therapist I have issue in the way this author has claimed ideas of CBT and developmental theory as her own without a single reference to original sources. Also, there has not been any research done on the results of parents implementing this program. I was able to attend the training for becoming a facilitator of this program and find that I cannot recommend this program but I can see how it might help higher functioning parents or children. If you have an emotionally disturbed child or are a professonal working with this population you may want to save your money."
2,CD Quality,"Quality of CD not good. First performance sounded as if there was alot of background ""popping"" or hand slap as if it had been recorded from an original in a non-sound proof room. Love the cello suites however!"
4,Not too bad!,"This dvd'd ok. It has the original program in it, and some new features. Although I was a bit dissapointed as the new features, only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters, and the T.Mac ending goes for like 5 mins, and the quality isnt that great!"
2,Not the Original,"Being a Marvel Fan from way back, I found this video and immediately ordered it. Much to my chagrin, this was not the 1967 version but rather 1997 one. I remebered fondly the episodes in the 60's when I grew up. While I did enjoy the video, I felt kinda ripoffed. In its three incarnations as animation, I always found the 60's original superior where the best characters were introduced...Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Molecule Man. This third incarnation is decent, but lacks the adult appeal. Let's not even go into the second version...no human torch? Herbie the Robot? Jeez!!"
4,"Fantastic Four, it's just a cartoon!","Ok, so this is not ""Oscar"" winning material, but it is just a cartoon based on a comic book. The origin of the FF is ok, but Dick Clark being the Emcee for the show and the FF trying to sell books on a talk show is a bit humorous. You can still see how ""The Thing"" met Alicia-cartoon version- and see the Fantastic Four use their powers in live action. It's still a good cartoon and a good quality video. If you have kids, this is a great cartoon for them, but if you are an avid fan, you'll have to overlook some of the simplicity in the cartoon."
4,Best Knight Yet,"More refined than his previous efforts, ""Enough Rope"" still has all of the ingredients that us CK fans enjoy. It's edgy, insightful and full of songs that cover how tough this journey through life really can be. While definitely not a mainstream artist, Knight's music will strike a chord for the many of us that have been there and done that. If you like any of his previous work, or are looking for something a little off the beaten path, I recommend this album."
2,In Two Words? Guy Flick,"Roderick Blank has it together. He's financially successful and is getting married to the perfect woman and then the unthinkable happens. He gets an email listing all the women he has ever and will ever sleep with. And his fiancé isn't the last on the list.Sadly, many of the reference websites to this film tells how it ends. If I had known the ending up front, then it wouldn't have been as good. Sex and Death 101 is dark, funny, and the perfect guy flick. Simply said, not for me."
4,Low Budget Campy Fun,"I went into this film with zero expectations. I hadn't heard of it before the DVD was put in front of me, and I think this is why I was so pleasantly surprised with the film.The movie follows the misadventures of a man who one day is mysteriously emailed a list of all the women he is going to sleep with within his lifetime. But the biggest catch is that the last name on the list is a serial killer. The film is produced on a tight budget but being a situational commentary not much is lost in the process. Although the film does run a little long at 117 minutes.Both Simon Baker and Winona Ryder put forth pretty good acting jobs. After all the problem's Ryder has had the last couple of years, its good to finally see her back in movies.The special features include Deleted Scenes, a Making-of, and a Commentary."
2,OEM USB data cable (Samsung),"The cable is only useful to me as a charging device. Without the software from Samsung or third party, I am not able to transfer any data off device. Still useful for a charging source if you are in the office or by computer."
5,I don't go anywhere without it,This cable is like my wallet. I don't go anywhere without it. I use this cord to transfer all my music from comp to my mp3 player. I love it!
3,Fair,"The title probably is the best thing about this collection, although there are some decent cuts here that I haven't been able to find other places."
4,"Not a lot of Diana footage, a friendly, good video","Consists mostly of various friends of and people associated with Diana speaking about her and the good she did. Some of these people are rarely if ever seen in other videos, Lucia Flecha De Lima and a few charity benificiaries are examples, which is a good point. You will see Diana in some of the same footage shown in so many other videos but you won't see the unhappiness in her life, for this memorial program they left out the accusations,scandals and rumors. This program does have some divorce, Camilla & Dodi bits but not much, mostly it is a review of the happy good things in the Princess' life."
4,Fun to read,I've had this book (paperback) for 4 years and finally read it last month. It took me awhile to get interested - but I'm glad I did. It was fun to read.
2,GmaNell,"I couldn't stand to read this book that is filled with foul language, profanity, obcenities and vulgar sex. It's too bad that what could have been a good story had to be ruined by so much offensive material. Why?"
1,How to play The Sims Original (found here),This is all about the original Sims and then towards the end gets in to the basics of Unleashed that one could learn from the program itself!Complete waste of money that only looks good on a shelf!
3,Its interesting,The movie itself is geared toward kids. My son loves it. Me on the other hand thinks its funny as hell.
4,The best Puss N Boots portrail ever!,"I orininally purchased this in VHS years ago for my young children. My recent DVD purchase was well worth the price, as I enjoyed the story again with my adult children. We all sang along with the happy cat song and loved the entire movie. A real treasure."
3,Meh...,"Popped and tasted fine. The corn is smaller that traditional yellow, so they tend to fly out of an air popper quite a bit. The shipping and handling is what makes this a less than desirable deal. Not worth $10 for 2 pounds of this popcorn."
5,Wabash Valley Farms Amish Gourmet Popping Corn,"This one in the purple color was very nice. Pops up a very striking white color with purple undertones to it.Great flavor to it, nice and light. Also for quite a large bag, I was shocked these never seemed to ""go stale"".This was a great purchase to be coupled with the stir crazy popcorn popper!"
5,gorgeous music,"I have this on my car cd player every day and I never get sick of it. I love her rich, mellow voice and pretty melodies."
4,Coco is a real good relaxing and soothing cd!,This is a really good cd because the songs are relaxing and soothing. They make u smile. The lyrics and the vocals are really good also. Coco is a really good cd. It was really worth it.
5,"Beautiful, effortless.","I bought this CD when it was first released and then had the pleasure of seeing Colbie in concert two weeks later. By the time of the concert, I pretty much knew the entire album by heart because I had listened to it so many times. Her voice is so wonderful and when you see her sing, it looks effortless. In person, she sounds exactly like she does on her CD. It was great to see her in concert to hear the story behind some of the songs. ""Tailor Made"" is a song she wrote for her sister, about finding the man of her dreams -- a guy who is now working on Colbie's show! (He came up to adjust her microphone during the show and she introduced him as her sister's fiance.) So delay no further -- go buy this CD right now! You won't be disappointed."
5,Great CD,"Fast service from this company. Coibie Cailiat is a local girl from the north shore, she is always on the radio."
5,The Best Album of the Summer!!,"Finally...a listenable CD!! After wasting a ton of money on other summer releases only to be miserably disappointed, I stumbled upon this CD at Target and blindly took a leap of faith. I'm really glad I did. This is the perfect summer album. A mix of semi-tropical sounding, pleasantly lyrical songs that work on a number of different levels. I'm not one to sit and listen to all the words of songs to detect their meanings, I just know what sounds good to me, so I can't comment on the ""depth"" of Colbie's musicality. But I do know that I had a summer seafood dinner party at my house on the Oregon Coast last night and had this album playing in the background and it set the mood perfectly. Almost everyone there wanted to know who it was and where I got it. That alone is proof that we have finally discovered the ultimate CD for the Summer of 2007."
2,Dissapointed,I have really tried to like this album but I get bored every time I listen to it. Ms. Calliat's songs are as forgettable as her voice. I'm not sure why so many people are so crazy about her.
4,Great Album,"I bought this album a whiles back and I love it. Colbie is an amazing singer and has some decent guitar skills to boot. She is absolutely beautiful (could be I have a thing for girls who play guitar) and her music is just as good. Her music is what I would compare to Jack Johnson if he wasn't boring. She also does a duet with Jason Mraz in his song Lucky which I love also. If you are a fan of mellow acoustic music then get this, if not then this album might not be for you."
3,the book was OK,I thought the book in the begining swas chasllenging and boring. But in the end when the lady started having millions of babies it was a lot better. i thought the book was ok
1,I do not recommend this book at all!!!,"This book was on my eighth grade reading list, so I read it, and was disgusted by it. First of all, the book has NO STORY! it's so dull, that it put me to sleep. a bunch of events happend, like people dieing and babies being born, but it seemed as though all of those scenes were similar, if not the same. they weren't connected in any way that was interesting, it was just like a series of tedious events with no connections whatsoever. I do not recommend it for anyone really, except for maybe younger kids, because it was written at such a begginer level, with such a basic style of writing."
5,More Brutal than John Wayne Gacy....,"simply amazing... i had doubts they could cut another record as amazing as their first release, but alas, they have. from start to finish, this record hits you like a runaway freight train. even better live and without a doubt one of the loudest bands i've ever had the pleasure of seeing live. you need this record. get the re-release of the 1st cd, the celtic frost cover is killer! hopefully they'll record the venom tune soon that they play live."
4,Go Galactic,"This video is pretty good, but the action is nowhere near the action-packed first and second movie. This does have its bad moments, but all in all, it's pretty good. It explains everything (pretty much) and has no huge plotholes. Speaking of plot...Leo Corbett stows away in a space settlement called Terra Venture and is on the run. Acidentally, he bumps into Kendrix Morgan and Kai Chen, two GSA officials. When asked by police, Kendrix makes excuses but doesn't answer Kai's own questions. Long story short, Leo stows away again on a training exercise and saves Kendrix's life, Kendrix and Kai's commanding officer Mike (guess) Corbett tells Leo off for following him, a portal opens up and a girl called Maya falls through. Mike and Kendrix investigate her world but Leo jumps in at the last second. What will happen? That's for me to know, and you to find out. So get the movie!"
2,"A ""Heartbreaking"" Separation","Having read the criticism by another online reviewer that ""Saint Joan"" is misleading, I wondered if we had read the same play. So I had a look at this book and the problem is obvious: no prefaces! Shaw's plays are meant to be read with his prefaces and they shouldn't be separated. Shaw himself intentionally wrote in that mode, noting at one point, ""I would give six of the plays that Shakespeare did write for one of the prefaces he ought to have written."" That's a little extreme, but the point is taken, and I believe that the general reasoning is valid. Shaw's complete plays with prefaces run to six volumes or so. Take that kind of route if you can; you'll be well rewarded with edification and entertainment."
3,A good introductory text,"Sacred Rhythms does a good job of introducing a spectrum of spiritual practices. However, it lacks depth and serious theological reflection."
2,Fetal mistakes,"2 1/2Playfully dramatic but ultimately unfulfilled experimental electronic-pop footnote, the album will bend more willingly to those seeking short-lived weirdness over memorable musicality."
2,Cheap Chinese knockoff,These are cheap copies of the SAS originals. I purchased and returned a pair of these imitations. The SAS shoes were comfortable from the instant I put my feet into them. Not so the copies.
3,Bland racing game with a few nice touches,"Yet another EA pumped out remake of a xbox360 title, which shows as this game actually looks better on the 360. Having said that the game itself is fun and the learning curve for the game is very good, making it easy for you to start with and then turning up the heat as you get more invested in the game. After this, the game just turns into a tedious battle against 'bosses' where the only way to win the race is to know the course completely and hope that luck ensures that 'dumb cars' aren't generated on the apex of key corners."
3,ps2 game,"this game is good if you dont care about how realistic it is because its like a basic ps2 car game to me. an example is how i can drive 200 mph and bounce off a parked car or wall and drive away like nothing happend then this game has giant lights that appear in the middle of the street just to show you were somethings at like a check point, thats something you see in a cheap arcade game. and the cops can never catch me so its pointless to get chased by them all you have to do is keep crashing into them going 200 mph when they road block you becasue remember your car is undestructable... wow what a rushed game they should have just made it for ps2 or for the wii."
2,way too tight,"I have an average sized woman's head (honestly, not swollen!). However, could not even get this product over my head to put it on initially. After much pulling I have stretched it enough to get it on. It's very uncomfortable. Did they give me a child's size by mistake? Not stretchy at all. I will either return it for refund or see if a neighborhood child has cold ears."
4,Good maple flavor,The maple aroma ffills the air the moment you tear the packaging. The maple flavor is stronger than in any other cookie I know. I left off a star because I want even more. Should be as stromg as maple sugar candy.
1,"Do Not Buy, Unit has a design flaw","I bought this unit with high expections as it was rated very well in multiple sources including Consumer Reports. However, it has a design flaw where the fuses blow and you get a ""F70"" error message which shuts the unit down. I followed up on the internet and found that this is a serious design flaw with the fuses that many, many folks have had so I would avoid this unit if at all possible.All the other specs are great, multiple digital ins, sound quality (when working) etc but right now it is an expensive paperweight."
4,fight the frizz,"Chi is a silk infusion product that fights the frizz without weighing down your hair. It has a great scent, and it keeps hair shiney and frizz-free. Try it, you'll like it!"
5,Farouk Chi Silk Infusion,This product really needs no rating as it speaks for itself. I have used this product for years and with great results. The best part is that you only use a little bit and wow your hair is shiny and beautiful. Thank you for the fast shipping as we (my daughter and I) were out and in desperate need of receiving it. Thank you again.Michelle Ward
5,a collectors dream book,this book is a definite for the collector of lighters. it is a book that all collectors of lighters should have. it is wonderful.
3,A good garden floral design book,"It pertains a good assortment of garden flowers and the drawing is graceful. Yet, the interpretation of the shading by scatter dots sometimes make the design look too busy."
4,Very basic cleanser for sensitive skin,"I received this product to try since I am a Bzz Agent. My skin is very sensitive, and often reacts badly to new products. This cleanser has a very luxurious, thick consistency. It feels very nice on the skin. There is very little fragrance (nothing added), which is great for those of us with sensitivities to fragrance. My skin feels clean, but not tight or itchy after washing and does not get red. Overall, it's a nice basic cleanser for people whose skin cannot tolerate harsher ingredients."
1,Product batch number problem,"Burt's Bees ' Date of production is the Third -fourth Digital.For an example:Product batch number is6581123,11Expressed as2011.but my purchased Burt's Bees ' Product batch number is 997605,I was confused,This means Production of 2060year .My God who could tell What does that mean. EMAIL:670306700@qq.com"
2,Waxy,"I am a big fan of Burt's Bees in general. This product, not so much.With the orange oil in it, it smells fabulous. But it feels awful. The stuff is thick and waxy, not creamy at all. It's kind of hard to smear around on the skin without majorly stretching the skin because it's so thick and stiff. I could, perhaps, overlook that if it seemed to rinse clear, but it doesn't. It feels just like you'd expect after smearing wax all over your face - like you can't rinse it off because water just runs off of it.I found it to be very much not worth the trouble."
2,It broke me out...!!!,I have used many burt bee's products in the past and I have loved them but this product made my skin break out and I woke up the next morning with big bumps on my face. I would recommend this if you don't have sensitive skin. I have loved all the other products I have used from burt's bees though!
4,Fun,"Fun and enjoyable game, although I wish you didnt decline so quickly after reaching the top. One of the better boxing games around."
3,Shadow Boxing,"Not much to this game, but to move the c sticks in every direction possible. You have a 1st person view and your arms and gloves are invisible. I thought Ninentdo Tyson Punchout was a much better and enjoyable game. I resold this back to Gamestop for $5. I'm really surprised at the high reviews. So far, I found the PS3 sport games boring."
3,PS3 Fighting Game,This game is quite frustrating takes some practice to learn how to use the controls effectively and button mashing will not help. Cause at first no matter how many times or how hard you push the buttons you will get beat. It does have amazing graphics. Overall the game is good and its worth the price you pay.
2,In need of an editor,"I do not intend to disparage the scholarship of Mr. Fox because as everyone knows, he is an exceptionally talented and well versed scholar. However, this book reads like it is a first draft. He meanders through nearly 800 pages citing reference upon reference, but with little or no coherence. It reads like a stream of conscience novel, and his paragraphs shift focus and theme without alerting the reader. I found myself continuously lost and having to read again each page and the page before in order to find his thesis, if it existed at all. I recognize that certain subjects are complex and reward closer inspection, but there really is no need to write in such a way that you can scarcely be understood at first approach. I would gladly rate his book higher if he would thoroughly edit it, and then offer a second edition."
1,"Enough of the Power Rangers already, Saban!","Damn it! I just came from dissing the new Lightspeed Rescue jobholders and now I have to do the same thing to THESE clowns? The Magna Defender was the only reason to watch Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, which in my opinion was very different from the previous follow-ups. Believe it or not, where the first three reincarnations had teens not yet graduated from college (remember ""Angel Grove""?), this one and the seriously reincarnated Lightspeed Rescue puts these former superstars in a whole new role. Here, they work for their masters, and most recently, they even have jobs, but who cares? Can you imagine the ridiculous craze that stormed the world years ago? Make it stop once and for all!"
3,Rapping Didn't Match Production,"This could have been a better album had the main rapper's skills went with the quality production Quik came with. Too often Playa Hamm wasn't rapping on beat. Plus I felt that lyrically he and Tweed Caddilac got too focused on using the bitch,hoe and nigga lyrics that too many gangsta/playa rappers do. This made the lyrics feel too repetative in my opinion. I have heard Playa Hamm rap since this album on Quik's Safe & Sound and I think he's a better rapper now than he was back then with this album.So musically I was feeling it,but lyrically I felt it was too repetative for the reasons I mentioned."
2,a VERY dissapointing introduction,"I have always been interested in these ""introducing"" books. at first, I just thought that they were for old philosophers and psychologists. I had always wondered if there would be one of these books with chomsky... then I found it! i couldn't wait to read it. what a fool I was. for almost the entire book, its about chomsky on linguistics which, by the way, MADE NO SENSE AT ALL!!!!! it was just so confusing, which was the whole point of making an introduction in the first place! then when thats FINALLY over they suposedly ""go over his political views"" which is HAVE AS LONG AS THE OTHER PART!!! it only 46 PAGES!!! and it still doesn't explain anything! oh well, at least theres ""chomsky for beginners"" they do the same thing as the ""introducing"" series but I've looked over this one and it does look A LOT better. the back of the cover explained more than this entire book!!!"
3,He's trying too hard!,"If Mr. Greenman wouldn't try so hard to be clever and witty, this could be a fantastic book. Unfortunately, much of the humor seems to forced and is at times, painful to read. I can almost feel him over my shoulder, telling me ""Look, isn't that a clever twist. Oh! That's so funny! You should be laughing now!"" I did laugh after the first few stories, but then when I knew I was supposed to be laughing, I didn't.There are a few real gems in these stories, but many fall short of greatness. I feel they were just included to fatten up the book. Oh, and those ""musicals"" need to go.I really wanted to like all the pieces in this book, but I just couldn't. The writing didn't seem sincere to me. Don't try so hard to be clever, and make me laugh. I can figure that out myself."
4,The Dolores Story is Great,"There are some piece in here I don't understand, like one that's just a long list of items, but the last story, ""What 100 People, Real and Fake, Believe About Dolores,"" is one of the best stories I have ever read. I thought so when it came out on the McSweeneys site, and I still think so now. It's not like any other story that i know."
5,Easy to use,"Needed a DVD cleaner for our laptops, etc. Saw this and ordered it several months ago. It's extremely easy to use - just put it in the DVD player and follow the instructions. Cleans well and I have no regrets in purchasing this item."
2,Natural means bleak?,"This is another book I purchased from amazon.com, based on client's reviews. I hoped to get something exciting, but, was disappointed. This book presents a ""natural home"" as bleak and colorless. The dominating colors are white and green. I don't think nature has only these colors in store. What about the riches of spring, summer and fall colors, the reds, blues, violets, oranges to name a few? The author has an aesthetic eye for displaying pictures. But all in all, I am returning this book for a full refund. I am disappointed because I did not get my money's worth."
1,What The Heck?,"Apparently, you get what you pay for when it comes to knives. I was embarrassed to give this as a gift after I opened it, but there's too much of a hassle to return them. Firstly, THEY CAME OPENED. The plastic packaging was already opened..and the crappy camouflage cardboard that's cheaply glued into the case was peeled off. The knives, all of them, had dirty black finger prints all over them. They weren't clean at all, and I'm not hard to please..but when I buy something NEW I expect it to come looking NEW. Not USED. We haven't used these yet but I'm without a doubt certain that they can't handle any real cutting..they look so cheaply made..I really should have gone with my gut and bought something a little pricier. Don't buy these unless you really don't care about your knives."
1,Not reliable,"I just ordered a new phone to replace this one. I'm on my second battery, but the new battery still dies after just 45 minutes of talking. No beeping, no warning, just DEAD. I can't even make it through a one-hour conference call. Meanwhile, after 6-8 hours of charging, the battery is still dead. (The indicator says it's charged, but it still fails to work.) Lately I spend most of my days talking on my cell phone instead. The speakerphone only works when the phone is out of the cradle, so when the phone dies you can't even use it in speakerphone mode. I just ordered a new phone (not a Panasonic), and hopefully that model will be better."
4,"good phone, awful battery","the phone works great. I have had this phone for about 4 years now. the problem that i had was the battery. After a couple of menths the battery started to last less and less, to the point where it lasted for only 2 minutes. I changed the battery for one with more mAmps and the problem was solved."
4,diapointed,I gave it a 4 only because of the abundant nudity in chained heat especially of blair & would have given it a 3 if not for the nude scenes of blair. I was disapointed in red heat because 75% of the shower scene was cut. 2 rape scenes & part of at least 2 other rape scenes were cut. I think part of the intake scene was cut too. I do not remember if any others were cut. The original version of red heat is acually better than chained heat. Jungle warriors is just plain bad even the one nude scene of the group gang rape of the women. The quality is not the best in this one either.
1,incomplete,Red Heat was not complete. A scene was cut from the movie. This is why I bought the film for that one scene. Films I buy are never cut. I am very disappointed.
3,"Good Picture Quality, but Red Heat is an edited version","The picture quality on these films is suprisingly good (anamorphic). To my recollection, Chained Heat is uncut, but buyers should be aware that Red Heat is an edited version with the scene between Linda Blair and Sylvia Kristel in the warden's office cut almost completely to remove the nudity & violence."
4,Literary Whydunnit,"In her work on the events surrounding the duel that killed famed Russian writer Pushkin, Vitale weaves a literary web of both his contemporaries' accounts of the events leading up to the duel and its repercussions, and the often tangled motives of the players and those who reported their actions. Similar in its reconstruction techniques to Charles Nichols' ""The Reckoning"" (dealing with the murder of Christopher Marlowe), ""Pushkin's Button"" reads like a great mystery, and a window onto upper class Russian society of the day"
3,nice scent but not strong,"The scent of this oil spray is nice BUT it wears out fast and the pheromone is not strong at all. Save your money on this one. the spray is also more of a direct squirt/drip so, dispense it into your hand not like a perfume or you will ruin your clothes and makeup."
3,this is what I think of the Dake,"I am astounded that one man can have so much insight into anything.I was not dissapointed even though it never had the same appendix's as the bigger version, had I known that I would have bought that one instead.This bible is the fruit of 100,000 hours of bible studies of 1 man and therefor is prone to errors and his persoonal oppinions that would be edited out if there were a team collaborating on it.I found it herretical from the first verse, he was making claims of a pre-adamic creation and subsequent primeval deluge before Adam based on scant evidence.would I buy this again if this one got lost or ruined... no probably not"
5,Adorable Movie With Uplifting Music,"Well, this simple little movie has a wonderful soundtrack. I will try to stay away from describing too much details about the movie. But, you often watch movies and hear the typical music of today's artists. Well, this independent movie has alot of independent artists with folk-like music. I just love the guitar and falsetto voice which reminds me of the long journey from New Mexico to California. It lifts you up into that great blue sky where everyone just tries to live each day to the next day. All I can say is that this music makes me glad that I am alive. We all need a pick-me-up and this soundtrack definitely does the trick. Well, go out and watch the movie to enjoy the music with this wonderful story. By the way, the most hilarious song on this CD is ""Superfreak"" by Rick James. When you watch the film and finally understand where this song fits in, you just laugh your pants off."
1,No arrival yet after 1 month!,"I can't give a review of this book as it has not arrived yet. It was ordered Oct.8th from ""customlov"". You said it would take 5 to 10 bus days to arrive in Hawaii and so far nothing has come. We are really upset and will never ever use a 3rd party again. This service is unreliable. The book is for my architect husband and he has needed it for designing a home here in Kona and is at an extreme disadvantage without this book. Amazon should somehow correct this situation and rapidly."
2,NOT !! for beginners,"I just got this book and have been trying to read for the last few days. It's dry as toast, and goes into very little detail on how things are done. It will start a new subject and not even gin an explanation as to what it is. Magic wand;, just tell you how to use it, not what it's used for, no examples of what an image looks like before you use it, with another one after so one can see the difference. This is the first review I wrote, but I just had to get the word out. If you're a beginner you need something else, so my quest goes on."
3,noise,"I have had this fan now for about a year, it replaced a really old fan that was really made of metal. On low it is nice a quiet, but any other speed it is not. I use it every nite when I go to bed. in the winter low is good. but in the summer I wish I could turn it up a notch, but I can not handle the noise."
4,A white fan with a BLACK cord????,What were they thinking??? This is a white fan (which cost a bit more than the black fan) but it comes with a black cord!!!! Yuck! From an aesthetic point of view I give it a 1 star. No wonder they don't show the cord in the product picture.Functionally it is very quiet and moves a lot of air!
4,Book Review,The book was in the described and proper condition. It was an excellent purchase. The only fault is that I received the book later than I should have; delivery was slow.
2,The new Spidey.,This is not the old Spidey cartoon I grew up on. It is some 1990 remake and is not all that good.
4,These stories are out of order.,"Content-wise, these stories are standard later Braun.It is disconcerting, however, that ""The Cat Who Moved a Mountain"" isn't followed by ""The Cat Who Wasn't There,"" ""The Cat Who Went into the Closet,"" and ""The Cat Who Came to Breakfast,"" which is the correct chronological order and also the order in which they were originally published.The last two stories in this compilation, ""The Cat Who Blew the Whistle,"" and ""The Cat Who Said Cheese"" should follow the stories above.Because of this, plot elements suddenly appear in ""Whistle"" and ""Cheese"" that are only explained in the following compilation.This rearrangement of the stories is peculiar and confusing. I surmise that Putnam somehow screwed up. I hope if the books are republished that they will be grouped in the correct order: (Mountain, Wasn't There, Closet) and (Breakfast, Whistle, Cheese)"
5,Incredible,I bought this for my brother-in-law and he is so happy and grateful I found it. He listens to it all the time. Very unique artist & very gifted. Great music.
5,A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO THE LITTLE HOUSE BOOKS,"Across the Puddingstone Dam is a wonderful book about how Charlotte Tucker, future mother of Caroline Quiner, who is the future mother of Laura Ingalls, grows up in her rapidly expanding town in the East. It is full of wonderful descriptions, that Little House readers have come to love, and seems to be fairly historically kosher. It is refreshing to get the history that precedes Little House...Charlotte is a feisty and smart little girl, and has many realistic interactions with her brothers, sisters and neighbors...this book will not disappoint! I highly recommend all of these books to the Little House lover."
5,The Story of The Scottish Homecoming...,"The book ""Across the Puddingstone Dam"" is about Charlotte Tucker, who is one of the many children that Lewis and Martha Tucker from Scotland have. Charlotte Tucker has the following brothers and sisters Lewis, Lydia, Mary and George. They continue on with the Scottish tradition that has been Martha's and Lewis's type of life for many years since their childhood. The kids would look forward to having stories about Scottish History and when their parents were young. Charlotte and Lydia were interested in about a school that has just opened up. If you would like to discover more of the scottish stories, and more of the adventures that Charlotte and her family went through, pick up a copy of this book to read."
4,Bizarros and Freaks in the Art World,"This book is a gas! It consists of little vignettes about a cast of bizarre and shallow artsy characters in New York. The book is utterly entertaining and affirming of the trendy bizarreness of the art world freakos. It had me laughing out loud several times.Marley Mantello and his brother Achilles are a scream, along with his mom who is so fat that it takes all her energy just to rest. She has so much fat on her body that she appears to have no bones on her feet, ""her little figgys"". She tells Marley she thinks she's pregnant from having sex twice with a professor of the politics of television. Marley plans to name the baby Achilles and raise it as his own.The book is well-written and descriptive of the egotistic, narcissistic and shallow self-centeredness of minor artistes."
2,Poor Qualtiy/Great Price,"If you're like me and frequently misplacing your reflex hammer, or worse yet, having your medical gear sprout legs and walk, this is a great deal. It's relatively poor quality (the brush is falling apart by the first week), but very cheap. I doubt it will last more than a year, but I doubt that it will not have disappeared by then."
1,A waste of time for anyone with common sense,"I would expect a book on Strength training to have some obvious information (Squats for leg strength). I would expect a Martial Arts book to at least address some of the issues that Martial Artist have about Strength Training. This book has alot of the former and none of the latter. The ""chapter"" (two pages)on designing your routine went against everything I have ever read on training, for instance working your abs out before your legs. Overall the book is of little use to an intermediate Martial Artist and certainly a danger to begginers."
4,UH-MAZ-ING,"OK well let me start off by saying Buy this cd! I just returned from from living in Europe, this cd ruled there. None of my friends had heard this cd yet. So, being the dj that I am I gave 'em little taste of it. THEY LOVED IT! You will surely enjoy this cd I promise!"
5,Great Price for a popular childrens movie,My 5 year old and 16 year old love Monster High. Great price for a popular item! I recommend all monster high movies!
5,"I'm not a kid, nor a teen and I enjoyed it SO MUCH","What can I say? I'm not a kid nor a teen. I was cautious about giving it a try, but I watched it and LOVED it! Amazing and very beautiful graphics, lovely characters, funny humor that isn't too childish and it's just all awesome. I want to see more of this kind! A+ for everything within the movie!"
2,Product appeared,"Product appeared as new but when opened, it had fingerprints all over the disk and scratches all over the bottom. It was a gift to a 7 year old. I have asked her parents to play it and review for defects before deciding what to do"
4,Good Movie for the Monster High Fans,"I pre-ordered this for my daughter, age 6, two months before release... We are both fans. Of course, two months gives you a lot of time to have high expectations. All and all, a pretty good movie. We watched it together the day it arrived. We both liked it. I'd say it's similar to Scooby Doo meets the modern, pre-teen world. The voices of the characters are all different, which I liked. It seems the Barbie movies' characters all sound the same. That gets old quickly. All and all, if you have a Monster High Fan, I'm not sure you can go wrong. :)"
4,A interesting movie,My daughter watched it last night on the computer. She enjoyed the movie. We are all planning to watch on big tv tonight. She seemed to enjoy it alot.
5,thank you,my boyfriends little sister will love this very much!!! it came in perfectc condition and i have no doubt that it will be a well watched movie
5,good game,she play the game everyday and every night then she it every night she just loves to she loves the gamethank you
2,Disappointing,"I've listened to Dylan and his interpreters for decades and I found this collection to be extremely disappointing. I'm actually surprised by the positive reviews of the other listeners. For me, only the rendition of ""Love Minus Zero"" rang true. Landa's ""All Along the Watchtower"" sounded like Dylan meets Riverdance and the phrasing of Simpson's ""Boots of Spanish Leather"" is so strange you forget it's a conversation."
3,Patience,This product would probably work really well but I don't have the patience to do it for 45 minutes like the directions says it may take to see results.
2,"Can't Remove Scratches,But Polishes it good",This iTem Isn't for removing scratces at all my white nano has suffered with scratches by using it but with the crome back of the ipod nano polished that good
2,Doesnt really work,it barely removes any scratches and its kind of messy. i honestly didn't like this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone for a scratch remover.
2,NOT A SCRATCH REMOVER,"IT IS NOT A SCRATCH REMOVER. It is not even as good as the auto paint scratch remover. It is a good polish though. It also only works on plastic. I used it once to polish the back of my 3GS. Since I got the Iphone 4, the iDrops is pretty much garbage."
2,Reallyyy donttt buyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was the worst thing i ever bought. i looked up all the instructions from the bottle and from other sources and i spent almost an hour trying to fix up my ipod and nothing happened. This product was a waste of my moneyy and a waste of my time!!!!!!! my black 30 gig video ipodd is still full of scratches andd hopeless....
1,PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AS ADVISERTISED,"PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED. I HAVE TRIED CONTACTING THE COMPANY NUMEROUS TIMES FOR A REFUND AND THEY WILL NOT RESPOND. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, COMPANY DOES NOT STAND BEHIND."
3,It was ok,For the price the item worked fine. I dont have an ipod but I do have a Zen Vision M and I use the liquid on my screen frequently. I do notice that it does help with the scratches a bit. It isn't a magical sunstance that will remove everything but it is far better than nothing. For large scratches don't bother but for a new beginning scratch it is worth a shot. It is a good overall cleaner for cd's and random screens like cellphones and things. I found myself using it on my Predator 2 DVD because somebody got somekind of food on it. It got off the dried liquid food or watever and turned skipping whole chapters into watching the whole thing no problem. The liquid really does do wonders for the price and it really does appear to be the only thing to really help with scratches even marginally on the market.
2,won't turn off,The firt time I used this lantern it was great. Very bright and you can adjust it well. It worked so well it didn't want to turn off. It went down to a low glow but continued to feed fuel. My only option was to leave it on all night until all the fuel burned. It was too late to return it to Amazon without getting scalped so I called Coleman themselves. The customer service was great and I had the option of sending it back at my cost or they send me a new valve which I had to install. I have yet to recieve the valve and then attempt to change it out. Lots of hassle and definitely not worth buying it though Amazon.
3,Pros and cons,"First, look when the reviews on this product were written...a LONG time ago. Since then, CD openers HAVE evolved and I strongly suggest you take a look at the CD Stripper because it is not only sturdy and child-proof but recently got rave reviews in Readers Digest for being a great product...and they are right...it is.Why? Well, for one thing it has the unique feature of being both safe from very young fingers, especially those of toddlers... but simple enough for a child to use without getting hurt. It is sturdy and lasts for quite awhile. It was manufactured by a mother who needed an opener the whole family could use without risking damage to the CDs. The CD Stripper does the job.Until the, this one was fine. But spend the extra money and upgrade."
3,It's sad but true.,"TMNT did not need a next mutation. They were just fine left alone and following Eeatman and Laird s foundation. Don't worry the Turtles will be back, and they will be more popular than ever. You see their core audience members are now teeagers and young adults, and they still think that they are cool."
2,What was this?,"Fox Kids did a terrable job of continuing the Turtles movies! First of all, they never told us why the Shredder was still alive! Remember, he got killed in Turtles II! Even if he was still alive, he sould have been the Super Shredder! Second, the costumes stunk! Finally, the new villins were stupid! This is probably why the show got canceled on it's first season! If I were anybody, I would get the three TRUE Turtles movies and exclude this one!"
2,This ruined the original Turtle movie!!!,"I can't believe this movie!! It totally ruined the original three movies. What's this nonsense about a fifth turtle named Shinobi? There were only four turtles in the jar, not five like they said. I am a teenager, and I started watching the turtles back when I was like five, so I take this personaly. Oh well, I guess I would have to say to anyone reading this review, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!! If you really want to see it that bad, PLEASE RENT IT!! Don't take word for it, it's not that it was a bad movie, it was just totally fake, and the camera work was awful. Then the fifth turtle really got under my skin."
5,Horse hair fly whisk,"Great Horse Whisk - just as described, arrived immediately. I have been using this whisk for the past month and it has saved me and my horse from the annoying Horseflies! Thanks!"
3,"Pretty good, quick to make, vegetables inside are meh...","This couscous is quick to make (just boil some water, pour it in, wait 5 mins) and the couscous consistency and taste is alright for such a quickly prepared dish. My trouble was with the little corn and misc dried vegetables at the top of the couscous. They just never seemed to moisten properly, and always wound up tasting dry and unappetizing. You can eat around them, of course, but I'd rather not have to."
4,Pretty Darn Good,This stuff is pretty good. A bit mild for my taste but it has a nice flavor and is pretty filling.I kicked it up a bit with a little black pepper and some of my own curry powder. That really made it much better for my taste. I'M a big eater so for me it's a nice snack but most people would consider it to be a meal. It's very easy to make. I have found with these kind of products that they taste much better if you let them sit a few more minutes after adding the water then they recomend before eating them. That helps to hydrate all of the bits and pieces and it tastes much better that way. You can always reheat in the microwave. I would recomend this product to my friends.Dean
1,Not Good Rating,The cartoon itself is great but the quality of the product was extremely poor. It doesn't play without stopping altogether.
2,Not worth it,"I've had my CC radio for several years. After about the first year the display started to go out, and now it's completely gone. Because I lost my presets, its now almost completely non-functional since I'm forced to guess what radio station it's on. It had a one year warranty that is expired, so I guess I'm out of luck. I only give it two stars, because the reception is really good. It wasn't worth 15 dollars, let alone the 150 that I paid for it."
5,The big bang!!,"This is one of the great seasons, Goku facing the evil Frieza, and no commercials! The set is great and is a great buy."
4,Season 3,"I'd say this is one of the most important sagas in DBZ, and memorable to boot. The remastered video quality looks great, and the audio sounds perfect. Totally worth the money for a DBZ fan looking to buy it."
3,"Great show, boring season.","If you haven't seen the entire Frieza Saga then you probably don't realize how extremely dragged out it is. One fight should not take EIGHT HOURS. If you don't have the seasons before this one, I would buy them first, as they are far less boring. I would suggest the Namek Saga, as there are many fights but none get boring as here."
4,"Spot on, can't complain too much!","The presentation of the Dragonball Z series is brilliant. It is well worth the money and I would suggest it to any DBZ fan.The remastering quality is good, just the cutting of the frames that really irritates me. Having been moved aspect ratios, the top and bottom have both been cut off leaving you with a lesser image. It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!Other than that, the marathon feature is a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf."
3,Not Great Episodes,"Out of all the episodes from Power Rangers In Space, Saban had to pick the Psycho Ranger saga! I'm not saying the Psycho Ranger saga was bad, but it's not the best either. Countdown To Destruction should of been put on video or the Ninja Turtles/Space Rangers team up, ect... Countdown To Destruction was the best 2 part episode ever. This was the best team ever! And they deserved a great video, not a pretty good video."
1,Watch out - this is just the TV shows put together,"We were very excited to order this video, thinking we would see new action. But the tape is just all of the TV shows that include the Psycho Rangers put together all in one piece. If you've watched the whole first season of PR in Space on TV, you've seen all this. Of course, it is nice to see it all in one piece and without commercials, but there is nothing new here."
1,WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a VERY bad video.The new Power Rangers don't get fame.The Mighy Morphin is STILL the best.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,It's cool and i love it heaps.,I thought it was cool and i have the video and i watch it everyday.i have the whole set of power ranger costumes and i wear them to school.My friends have the video to and my friend chucked a power ranger party and we all had to wear a power ranger costume.My name is Blake.
4,Not as good as the last episodes!,"This movie has a basically good plot, nasty villains, and nicely done special effects. But this ""movie"" is not as good as the last two episodes. It shows touching scenes, a romance between Andros and Ashley, and a special appearance by Zordon! Rated PG for violence."
1,Power Rangers in Space [VHS],Don't get me wrong I love this movie but it is that when I was so happy I got this movie when it came in the mail I was so happy but as I opened it it was power rangers mighty morphing green with evil part 4 and I am like what the hell! Ethier that person ment to send me that video or not but if you are going to get it I suggest you buy it new not used!
3,Blue Hawaii/Paradise Hawaiian Style,"Blue Hawaii is a wonderful tourist video of Hawaii and has a cute story line. Paradise also has a decent story line, but has way toooooo much singing for me. Still, this is a good pick if you like Elvis movies and beautiful scenery."
5,Love Elvis!!,"Love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love It!! :) Love Hawaii,been there and it is beautiful"
4,in the shape of your heart,"any true Jackson Browne fan can shoot holes in any best-of package. No one set could be perfect for every fan. The best of disc is a fair representation of his work including a bit too much of the 80s stuff. Even so, it helps to remind what a great song ""in the shape of a heart"" really was. Truth be known, a great best of J.B. could be a copy of Late for the Sky. What made me buy this set was the live stuff. For a dancer and before the deluge are worth the price. What we need is a 3 disc set of live J.B. A poet, a true star..."
1,Horrible read,"I could not get past page 25. So boring. I like most of her other books but man, back to the library I go ugh."
5,Ice Age DVD,"Purchased this product because, as old as I am, I have not seen it. However, I failed to read the product label properly and saw that it was ""Making a Scene"", rather than the movie itself. My mistake. So naturally, it wasn't the whole movie. Just be careful how you read things...I know I will."
5,"Perfect for the Canon Powershot A-series (A75, A80, A95,...)","This bag is the perfect size for my Canon Powershot 95. The camera sits snugly in the front bag with the grip on the camera within easy reach. There is enough room left to store the wriststrap on top of the camera so that is not left dangling. The second compartment opens almost to the bottom of the case, so there is easy access to all compartments. There is plenty of space for spare batteries (4 AA's) and a couple of CF cards. The bag is easy to carry across the shoulder. There is a possibility to carry it on your belt, but for that it is just a bit too bulky.To sum up, recommended for the Powershot A-series, seems to have been custom-made for it."
5,Truly Great Hits,"This is really a great album featuring his early hits, including the first of his hits which made the charts ""It's Just A Matter Of Time."" This is a must album"
3,Only good for small bottles,"This machine is a great idea, but it is not good for larger bottles. It will fit a .75 litre bottle with no problem, but the bottom part of a 1.5 Litre is just too big to fit the opening in this cooler."
4,A quality compilation of classic Country Gents,This CD contains some hard-to-find material. Well worth the purchase by any CG fan.
5,A tuly amazing series (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD),"This is one of the most deep and touching series (or movie or book or anything for that matter) I have ever seen. This series will definity make you shed a few tears. It is a frighteningly real love story in a fantasy setting (although it is not fantastical, just futuristic in terms of a girl being a cyborg-like weapon). This anime will make you truly care for the characters (and not just the main ones, but for their friends as well). And you will feel genuinely sad when their world crumbles around them.I can't recommend this anime enough. It belongs in anyones collection (whether you are an anime fan or just like stories that will make you actually feel something.)A must buy."
2,Goes wide but not deep,"This book tries to cover a large amount of material, and as a result, it only touches on the basics. I was interested in the section on programming serial ports in visual C++ for a windows XP machine. The coverage amounted to 20 pages with no in depth discussion of problems that that might be encountered, and how to troubleshoot them. The book did allow me to do a little bit with serial port communications, but only enough to get me into trouble. I'm still looking for a book that explains how to do this in visual C++ on a Win XP machine. I give it two stars because it is well written, and it does allow the reader to begin to use the serial port."
4,"Great Lincoln, Nebraska Band","As the grandaddies of Lincoln's dinge rock scene, Sideshow kick booty with this 1995 release. It captures the essence of indie rawk with the Sonic Youth-ish geetar and a great whaling of the drumkit so mighty it can hardly be believed. We heart you, Sideshow!"
3,Good read,"I found the stories enjoyable and fun enough to finish the book. The stories were not as spiritually helpful as her book, ""Normal is Just A Setting On Your Dryer."" In fact, in this book there is very little about God. Overall the stories seemed rushed and almost choppy at times. I do love her personality and will try some of her other books."
5,The best PDA,"This is the most advanced PDA at this time. Soon there will be more VGA devices, but until this - Toshiba is the winner. e800 maybe not so small, but when we're talking about VGA resolution, CF+SD slots and other features - size is not so important. Functionality - Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition is the latest version of Microsoft operating system for PocketPC devices. Toshiba has given upgrade to second edition for free! There are only small number of PocketPCs with this operating system yet."
2,"Been there, played that.","I performed Scene 8 from ""Betrayal"" in a theater class, and read the rest of the play in order to form a character analysis of Emma. I found the play intersting, but slightly odd. Some of the wording made no sense, and there were times when the references seemed out of place and just in there for laughs. The play itself was an old idea broadcast in a new way-backwards. It left me feeling bittersweet as I saw how it ended, and then saw how sweetly it started. I recommend the play for its difference in story telling, but I'm not so thrilled with it that I would insist you see a showing. It really seems to come down to the tastes of the person. This one wasn't really my taste."
5,Unlocking the Bible,"By chance I heard David Pawson on television and enjoyed his views on Corinthians. It expanded my vision of the Bible and got me excited enough to decide at long last to actually read the whole Bible. After reading reviews, I decided to get the e-book/Kindle version of Unlocking the Bible and I haven't looked back! It feels like I have now a framework and organized way forward to understanding the Bible, something I've been searching for but hadn't found before. David Pawson's depth of knowledge and the way he throws in insights, linking ideas gives me that boost of confidence to tackle all the books with enthusiasm. I wish I'd had this book years ago."
2,"No complete season, = no sale","So, yet another random ""collection"" instead of the complete seasons, huh? Testing the waters again, are we, studio execs? Well... TENSHUN!We want the WHOLE tamale, boys! That's right, Phil Silvers was an American original - the Top Banana, baby! He deserves the full treatment - deluxe all the way! All the seasons, all the episodes, in all their crowning glory! Otherwise, forget it! Now go out there, you fancy studio dudes, and do it over again properly!Hey UP!"
4,Bilko review,"I enjoyed seeing the old original Bilko shows uncut for todays TV commercials. I wish there were more shows available for viewing. The commentary by Allan Melvin, who was Sgt. Henshaw, was great. One always wishes for more extras in these sets, but all in all I was satisfied with this set."
5,Sgt. Bilko 50 th Annniversy,"Sgt. Bilko was the Avis of early TV comedy behind Lucy,in the early days of television. His cast and crew were one of the funniest ever assembled to appear on the tube. You were always laughing , even now into my 60's I remember the ""Harry, Speak Up"" show, where they try and enlist a chimpanze into the Army . I still laugh when I think or see it again. It brings wonderful happy memories of growing up in the Fifties, and how wonderful TV comedy WAS."
5,Great Quiver,great product and a very good price... i have used it for several mths and enjoy it. it is made very well and of good quality. would recommend highly
1,Broken,"[...] This controller has been advertised as being ideal for FPS players due to an invert switch for the right thumbstick. It's a lie. The one I got has a little plastic notch where the picture on Gamester's website depicts the switch.Another reason I've found this controller to be a useless piece of crap is the fact that the left thumbstick button only works when the stick is in a neutral position. This is the dealbreaker for me. Every FPS I've played on the Xbox has used this button for crouching. In Halo 2, there are many places in the multiplayer maps that are inaccessible without crouch-jumping, which is impossible to do with this controller.[...]"
4,good space opera - it's standing the test of time!,"I'm enjoying the read, but have to agree with a previous reviewer that noted a quite a few typos in the text..."
4,"great ideas, too bad it's so ancient","The ideas behind the Sector General books are very interesting and I'm glad James White was able to publish them.The only trouble I have is, the thinking is so anachronistic and thus misogynistic, that it's like speaking another language.I'll be reading happily long and stumble smack into something so offensive that it takes a moment for me to tell myself the books are very old, that guy was a contemporary of Heinlein, he can't help being such a jerk.I think the clash between his advanced ideas about multiple species interaction and his backward ideas about female humans, is the most startling part. If he were just an ignorant old fool then those outbreaks would not be startling.It's too bad he couldn't overcome his own prejudices.That being said, this is a nice collection of the foundational stories in the Sector General universe. If you can overlook the warts then it's a good read."
5,Todo Panchos,This CD was a great Xmas gift for my boyfriend (89 years old). He really enjoyed all his favorites in this CD. The sound is great and I would definitely recommend this CD even if you've never heard of Los Panchos.
4,Beautiful Candles,These candles are well made and have a lovely scent while burning. For pure beeswax candles they are priced accordingly. I only wish the shipping was less.
5,Amazing!!,"My boyfriend is a huge Yankees fan and really enjoyed having this to add to his arsenal of Yankee gear he has!The shipment was quick, and the product was delivered safe and sound."
3,great,really was surprised the songs where slower than expected. bought other albums and was happier with them. sound was good though
2,DAV-C770,"I have mixed feelings about my new DAV-C770. The pros: The overall sound upgrade from my old (non-surround sound) system is a major improvement. The sound quality is excellent and the five disc CD/DVD player is a major bonus not found in many systems this size and at this amount. Now the cons: DO NOT BE MISLEAD, 90 watts a channel as a crock. I'm not sure who does the ratings for Sony but a corporate calibration of all equipment they use to measure output wattage is way over due. My old 45 watt Yamaha will spank this little component right in the amp and never look back. If you're looking for a small relatively inexpensive system with good sound, this is your unit. If you occasionally want to mix it up with the guys and rock the house, save the embarrassment and buy something else. My C770 still has that new toy smell ..."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This item has been in for repair 5 times, and Sony says that because they fixed it once, they won't correct the issue they caused during ""repair"" DON'T BUT THIS PRODUCT. I will no longer be buying Sony products, as they DO NOT care about there customers!"
1,Yet another croaker...,"As a few of the other recent reviews reveal, this system is a lemon. I too have a very expensive piece of crap on my hands and no sound system. Oh, and my 3 new DVDs are stuck inside as well. My options, pay Sony $180 to repair their error or count my losses and a new system. It's looking like the Dream systems are more of a nightmare. Don't buy it."
1,SAMSUNG = bad customer service,"TV died after 4 months. Covered under manufacturer's warranty but after 4 attempts to fix the TV I have now, Samsung finally agreed to give me a new TV. Its 2 months later since this whole process started and I still have no TV. Because they no longer make the 46 inch model that I have, I'm not guaranteed I will receive a new model. It will probably be refurbished. They had the nerve to offer me an upgrade for the newer model if I wanted to pay $350. This is by far the worst experience I have had with a customer service dept. Stay away from Samsung."
2,Another lackluster and overpriced item from Sony,"Cheap construction overall. The tuner dial doesnt line up with the stations. The AM/FM/TV switch doesnt line up correctly. The cassette door doesnt close completely. The sound is decent, but if you're in the market for a inexpensive portable radio, I'd look somewhere else."
3,Bulgari Por Femme Parfum,"I smelled a tester of this on my last cruise and fell in love with it. I ordered it from Amazon and when I got the bottle open and sprayed it on, it smelled the same, but seemed to be a watered-down version of the one I tested. I paid $56+ for this perfume and may send it back. Too bad, it smelled great on the boat!!!"
3,S & G Live,"This is a fairly good live recording, given the inherent difficulties in a live recording in this area. The tracks are of uneven quality but you get to hear some rarely recorded songs (i.e., benedictus, poem on the underground wall) in addition to some standards (i.e., 59th street bridge song, homeward bound, lazy shade of winter). If you don't have some of these, it is a worthwhile purchase; if you already have most, then pass on this, unless you are a fan of live over studio recordings."
5,Fit and working,"These spark plugs,NGK (2360) CR10EK Multi-Ground Spark Plug, Pack of 1,(O.E.M.) are specifically designed for my motorcycle.I've saved $15 purchasing through Amazon."
2,i didnt want a turkey hunting novel.,very wordy not much tactics at all. an elaborate biography of the writer. not much help wouldnt recoommend to an enemy
3,good design but to short to fit on my Toyota Tundra,"I had to grind down the ""pin"" section on the bolt end end almost 1/2 and inch to get it to pass through the 2"" factory hitch receiver on my 2008 Toyota Tundra otherwise I couldn't get the locking end cap on. This thing would be perfect if the pin section was a little longer, I was surprised it was too short. Toyota wraps the outside of the hitch receiver with a layer of metal for the safety chains and that makes thicker than everything else.. after I modified by grinding it down with a 4"" circular grinder it works great."
5,Movie,"This movie came packaged well, still in the plastic. The box was in great condition as well. It arrived on time and as promised. It was a great gift idea for my grandmother who loves the Lion King."
3,Song extras were horrible!!!,"When I was a kid, I watched this movie everyday several times a day. I had all the songs and lines memorized and played out my favorite scenes and songs. When I watched the platinum edition, they had put in extra songs and some of the original songs changed a bit (as advertised). I thought the special edition was going to make this movie even more amazing and that I'd be reduced to tears of gratefulness for having been granted this glorious gift of extras. Instead, it made one of my favorite disney movies seem strange and unfamiliar! Now normally I can really get into extras and deleted scenes being put into a special edition, hence the reason I bought this dvd. But I guess I am too attached to the original version."
4,A great introduction to verbal aspect,"This was the first book I've ever read thoroughly on verbal aspect, and its crystal clear definitions are very easy to follow. It carefully talks about the meaning of aspect, the perfective/imperfective distinction, and pretty much everything you might want to know about this topic (such as related morphology and combined tense/aspect oppositions).The only reason why I rated it 4 rather than 5 is because many examples have not been properly glossed, and I had to rely on my prior knowledge of many cited languages (which I reckon shouldn't have happened)."
2,Problems,"Worked for 2 days, then did not work. Found out that replacement bulb is discontinued and hard to find. Not happy!! Returned lamp."
1,Skip this and buy the Verilux,"Purchased this product for my wife for Christmas. After setting it up (not ot bad), it worked for about 15 minutes and then quit. Call the MFG who told me to try a new bulb.Good luck on that, I went to at least 7 stores in the Cincinnati area and could not find a replacement bulb, I am now sending the whole thing back and will buy the verilux.Should have know better than to try and save a few dollars."
1,I wish I had read these reviews BEFORE I bought this product.,"Same story. The lamp worked for a good while and I liked it. Then it stopped working with a buzz. I bought a replacement bulb from a local discount store. The lamp didn't work, so I returned the bulb for a refund and bought another from Amazon. The lamp still doesn't work. Since the rest of the reviews lead me to believe I'll get no remedy from the company, this product is headed to the trash."
4,"It's very, very bright!","I like this lamp a lot, actually, but I cannot have it directly over me. Thanks to the great design, I can point it upward so it's bright but it's not blinding bright.The brightness seems to help with my mood, too. It doesn't flicker or make any noise like some lamps do and my eyes don't seem tired when I'm staring at a computer screen (from being a writer, I'm always in front of the computer screen...) I don't know if it's really helping me stay away from the winter blues but I feel much better than I did last year, so it could be working or maybe I just want to believe it's working. :)It's not the most fashionable of lamps but it does what it's supposed to do and I'm glad I bought one!"
4,Great Lamp but Wish it was Taller,"I am using it as a plant light and the plant is doing well. However, I had to put it on top of 2 decorative storage boxes to get the necessary height.I have a beautiful fern which my husband has named Seymour (see Little Shop of Horrors). Yes, it is large and really did dominate the living room. A year ago I moved the plant to the corner of the room. It started losing a lot of leaves and didn't look healthy. So it got moved back to its honourary position in front of the window (southern exposure). I bought this lamp to see if I could get my fern to accept the corner position. It has been 1 month since I made the move. I put the lamp on a timer to turn on for 4 hours a day (morning). Since the move, the fern has lost very few leaves, it has good colour, and there is new growth.This lamp appears to be giving the right amount and the right quality of light. It meets the purpose for which it was purchased."
1,Hunk of Junk,"This lamp came with the wrong threads on the (3) seperate tubes that needed to be screwed together in order to build this item.When I called the ""customer service"" representative from the lamp seller (Amazon will not help you with this detail), they could not help me determine which of the (3) tubes I needed to re-ship for exchange.I offered to send the entire box back at which point they said no, just figure out what exactly the broken part was using the instruction sheet, then fax a written request at which point they will ship that part.In short, this useless pile of tubes, wires and lights sits in a closet which at some point will be thrown away and I will wind up going out to buy a new lamp.Forget about getting your money back.."
4,Fun for those like polka,"This is the first CD of Frankie Yankovic's music that I've purchased, and I love the tunes. I'm one who's into all types of music, but if you're like me and enjoy fun, maybe, at times, silly sounding stuff, do check it out. The only song that I listen to over and over is ""Somewhere My Love."" The five bucks is worth it."
3,this is wayy to small for my toes,"i have tons of toe rings and this one is ridiculously small.. hurts to wear when stretched so i gave up.the quality, however is good."
5,An Entertainment Must,"If you have enjoyed watching classic Abbott and Costello movies, like I have, then this is a must for your collection. This is vintage entertainment at its finest. Enjoyed by young and old this collection will bring you hours of laughs and chuckles. This is truely an entertaiment must and a collection to be treasured for years."
4,Great Movies.-One lousy commentary,"This is an excellent set of movies, good for a long weekend. The only drawback was the lousy commentary by suppose it Film Historian Frank Coniff on the ""Who Done It"" movie. Obviously knew nothing about the supporting cast, sets etc.... Universal wasted their money on this guy. I love informative commmentaries on movies, this guy struck out completely. Glad I never watched Mystery Science Theater."
5,Abbott & Costello,Was so glad to see that the humor of Bud and Lou was not lost on me after so many years.
2,Missing some A&C titles,"According to the movie listing, several titles are not in this release.Abbott & Costello meet Captain KiddDance with me HenryLost in a HariumI'm sure there are more, however, can't think of the titles"
4,Llovely Llittle Llama Llegend,"Riveting. Filled with suspense as the readerquestions whether Lloyd will ever find anyonewhose mother is of his own species. This storydefinitely bucks the trend of most of the children's picture books being published today which are either exceedingly preachy or insultingly simple. ""Is Your Mama a Llama?"" isneither. It is well-balanced between its illustrations and its narrative. A clever surprise is inserted as Lloyd finds Llyn althoughI would have preferred if she had been named Llullu which is what I would name a female llama if I had one."
5,Longtime Smartype user....Love the new 2012 version.,"I loved this version of Smartype and the previous versions as well. I have clung to it all these years, still using Word 2003 so I could continue to use Smartype. It makes me faster, reduces the amount of errors spellcheck has to find, and even helps with researching words. I am so happy they have finally updated it in 2012 to work with Windows 7, platforms, and other word processors. I was afraid I would have to give it up like the previous reviewer. Try a web search for the new version!"
1,Vague overview at best,"As several reviewers have already pointed out, this book doesn't get into the details of Java programming with Oracle. This book is really a vague overview of Java beans and messaging. You're better of buying a book that specifically covers JDBC programming."
4,To the point,Having been on Oracle review committee for the last 2 yrs i find this book very easy to read. It is detailed in explanation and examples and references are precise. I would say that the book is really written to promote all the standards and features as stipulated and i would highly recommend this book.
1,THIS DOESN'T WORK!,"I was scammed by the first Sally Hansen cuticle remover in the small bottle with a blue liquid. It did not work! But, I am desperate, and can't afford a $50 pedicure every week, so I bought THIS STUFF -- another Sally Hansen LIE. It did NOTHING. I used it EVERY DAY. I let my feet soak in the shower. I sat down and put the crap on. I waited TWO minutes, sometimes even three. NOTHING CAME OFF. Many times, I put it on a second time thinking, MAYBE my calluses/dry skin were just TOO dry... NO CHANCE.don't buy this! it's a RIP OFF"
2,Too Cute By Half,"Waldner has a good and evocative ear, slinging moon, June, spoon rhymes and assonances around with grace and ease. Perhaps she has become too enraptured by her facility with language, because I felt that there was nothing to most of these poems apart from the wordplay. The occasional emotional insight was not enough for me to enjoy this book as a whole."
5,LO MEJOR DE LA SALSA CLASICA ES CON WILLIE COLON!!!!!!,"EN ESTE CD, SE VA A ENCONTRAR LO MEJOR DE LA SALSA DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS...TODO RECOLECTADO EN UN SOLO DISCO. pOR FAVOR TRAIGAN DE NUEVO ESTE ALBUM PARA PODER TENER EL GUSTO DE ADQUIRIR UNA COPIA. ME MUERO, POR OIR DE NUEVO LA CANCIO ""GITANA""...QUE GRATOS RECUERDOS DE ANTAÑO!!!!"
2,Great when it works...,"I got it for the price and the styling. It looks great. Best looking one I could find actually. I was only looking for a basic DVD player, so I have no insight into any of it's special features, lacking or otherwise.I actually like the remote. However, I have a SONY TV, so that may be why I haven't encountered any problems with it.The unit worked just fine until now though. It's been around a year now, maybe more maybe less, but I've lost the receipt by now anyways so I can't check for warranty. It's stopped spinning properly. Which is pretty pathetic IMO. I have CD players that have lasted for YEARS with never a problem.While this unit looks great, the ""SONY Quality"" is obviously no longer there..."
3,good unit but batteries poor in cold weather,This works good and I have used it a thousand times in a year. I thought the lith batteries were dying today but it might be the cold. It came on suddenly and so did this very early cold snap.Dont know exactly what to make of it.... I dont have that problem with NiCad.
3,Good strong and small cordless,"This is a good unit that delivers enough power to drive deck screws and fits in small spaces. The LiOn battery systems works exceptionally well for such a small battery. The one complaint is that there is not chuck accessory supplied with the driver. I could do without the soft case and the few bits, but a chuck is a relatively costly add on to what should be expected to come with a drill."
5,Great Cordless Driver,"Great cordless driver - stumbled upon when looking for a more compact and lightweight cordless driver that would have more power than most of the others. Does a great job - more power, light comes in really handy, and the both batteries come already charged when shipped! Don't forget to buy the bits, though."
5,Perfect size and power,"Not a problem with this nice driver. I needed something that would be small but powerful for doing electrical jobs on the work site. This has proved to be the ticket. It has a nice grip, good feel and balance that makes this just right for slipping into my tool pouch. It has enough power to drive any drywall screw or electrical device screw all day long. Battery holds its charge remarkable well and then charges quickly when needed. As stated before only negative is the led light not exactly on the screw head but having a small light in your hand at all times is a nice feature even if its not perfect. I would buy this again in a minute if I ever had to replace it again for any reason. Worth the money!"
3,Don't buy this as your only drill,"Not a bad little tool.Pros:Light weightCompactThe light is a nice featureCons:Not much powerBattery life is very lowCan't use conventional drill bitsLow RPM for drillingA nice tool to have for small projects that don't require much power. for anything else, get a ""real"" driver."
3,Bosch Mini Driver,Great for the little jobs. Doesn't hold up well if you need to counter sink a screw.
5,Great little driver,"I build cabinets and furniture mostly using 'pocket hole' joinery which requires a lot of screws. I usually use a 16.8 or 19.2 drill/driver which works good but gets heavy after a while.This little Bosch is about 1/3 the weight and size and has plenty of power. I used it to assemble a set of kitchen cabinets made of Red Oak and driving about 1500 screws, it never looked back. The ad said it could drive 300 2 inch screws on one charge...I got about 150 1 1/4 inch screws into oak, which I think is great. The charger is called a 1 hour charger, but it completed a charge in about 35 minutes. I would highly recommend this tool."
4,Great ITIL based overview of Systems Management,"This is a great book for IT managers who need a reference book with stepwise procedures to help plan, implement and manage any area of IT Systems."
4,Good Book but... Not necessarily for natives,"I found this to be an informative guide for adventurous tourists or new residents of the city. However, I would not necessarily recommend to adventurous residents of the city. If you already live in Chicago and you are, for instance, a blues fan it is no secret that Buddy Guy's Legends and the Checkerboard Lounge are premier venues. In other words while I wholeheartedly endorse this book for the aforementioned groups I would not recommend it to adventurous residents on the lookout for new experiences. You may certainly find a few but most of it will be old hat."
2,Minimalist Short Stories,"Gilchrist's work can get old. She has quaint, mean-spirited stereotypes of almost every ethnicity and race. She really goes at Jews and Blacks. This book has a truly evil Arab man.While her southern Episcopals may be naive, shallow alcoholics, they generally possess intelligence, culture and are affluent. Her Blacks are usually stupid and kind-hearted women or rough, big Black men.Because her writing is minimalist, the lack of depth to characters makes her stereotypes more difficult to swallow. Her stories are generally entertaining but also troubling and sad. The protagonist generally has a weak moral fiber and an obvious flaw.I don't know if critics have been picking up on the apparent prejudice in Gilchrist's writing, but it seems very evident to me."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"This was without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. Astoundingly boring, pointless, and then all of a sudden really preachy in the last third or so. Years and hundreds of pages pass and nothing happens, and the characters are completely uncompelling, especially the main character, who for all she goes through does not change one whit. Why was this book written? There's bad and then there's bad; this wasn't even fun-to-read-it's-so-bad bad. If I had had anything better to do with my bus ride, I would have stopped reading it after about the half-way point when it becomes clear that no, the story's not actually going to get exciting."
5,great book,"it is easy to read,and if you like black tea you will also like green tea ,a really great book about tea"
1,It failed,"I got the set, but it came with only the main parts, no track set, so i couldn't return it or use it. ..."
1,piece of .....,"""My son, with great anticipation, watched me spend an hour putting this thing together only to have it not even come close to working like it should have. Like the other reviews, thank goodness he didn't realize that it didn't work correctly because he was four. However since he has to push the cars by hand and rarely do they even make it around the track he tired of it almost immediately. Put the money for this in their college fund."
2,live fast and die early,"this heater worked great for awhile, then it just kinda melted away, it gets to hot and the construction is not able to contain all the heat, get a ceramic heater, more money but it is well spent $........."
4,quality of Sony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM/ shortwave world band radio.,"When choosing a multi band radio such as this one, you can't go wrong w/ Sony. I've had this model for a month or more and am very pleased w/it's performance, the sound is quite good and the holding of the stations I choose to listen to is very good. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys listening to a variety of radio bands and its portability. If there were any thing that I think would enhance the ICF-SW7600GR multi band radio it would be a power adapter to be provided, other than that I am enjoying the sound of quality that this model provides."
2,Shortwave reception is disappointing,"I bought this unit to replace my existing Radio Shack RX-396 (almost the same size as 7600gr) which is approx. 8 years old. I picked SONY because of many good reviews especially those from experienced shortwave listeners. After receiving the shipment, I made comparison between SONY 7600gr and my existing RX-396 and found that the SONY's shortwave reception is decidedly inferior to RX-396. Comparison were made under the exact same conditions. I have also read the Sony's instruction book very carefully and tried every possible techniques on the book. But none helped. So it is either (a) those folks giving rave reviews on 7600gr were testing some earlier (hence better) product, OR (b) my RX-396 is a too well designed/built product to be topped."
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","I really enjoy this radio. I am able to pick up short wave radio stations from around the world as well as all the local stations. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL."
3,It wasnt as good as I expected,"It seems like a solid little radio, and overall I thought it was ok, but there were a couple of things that I didn't like. First, the reception is poor. Also I was hoping that it would scan through all of the channels at the same time, but you have to push 2 buttons together to change bands, and when you search for a station, it will only search within that band"
1,SW7600GR radio is an embarrassment to the SONY name,I am a SONY fan and an armature radio operator. The ICF-SW7600GR radio is an embarrassment to the SONY name. I received this unit through my SONY points. My $39 no name unit works better on the short wave bands. An antenna does not help.
5,Sony icf sw7600gr,Very nice radio. The other reviews were spot on. I really likethe scan functions and SSB capability. For a small portible radio that handles shortwave you can't go wrong.Now if shortwave would make a comeback it would be great! The FM and AM work fine too.
5,LIstening to the world,"I bought this for my 20 year-old grandson Mark for Christmas and he had no trouble getting it to work, the reception is great and he is using it every day. Great, useful and interesting present! I hit a home run with this one!"
1,Useless for Shortwave,Couldn't tune in anything but a few local FM stations. Perhaps my unit is defective as I read many good reviews before buying it. Huge disappointment.
1,Doesn't work,"I can't pick anything up on this piece of junk. I've read the manual and read all kind of stuff on the internet and nothing works. I've tried faxes, I've tried voice broadcasts, I've tried tuning the SSB and also jumping up and down the range a few but nothing but static."
4,Dancing by the greats!,"This movie is a compilation of some of the greatest dancers and dances ever filmed! From the early days of Ziegfeld Follies and Busby Berkeley to modern ballet and break-dancing, you can see the different styles and forms of dance. Some of the stars are Ruby Keeler, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, a wonderful solo by Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, the Nicholas Brothers, Eleanor Powell, Ray Bolger, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Ann Miller, Leslie Caron, Nureyev/Fonteyn. Wonderful choreography from ""West Side Story"" and ""Flashdance"" and other memorable dance movies."
3,Very Enjoyable,"It was quite enjoyable, but nothing extraordinary. Recommended viewing for dance enthusiasts, those who want to know about its evolution in US."
3,not that great,"I love Fraco de Vita but I did not like this concert, I like many of the songs in this dvd but I did not like the in vivo concert version."
4,Nice and Simple...,"This is a great SIMPLE mp3 player that holds a full Gigabyte of music. What I really like is I can record my DJ sets at the club. Then, on the drive home, plug it up to the car audio and listen to it.Its small size is unbelievable - great for the gym or running w/ the dogs. Oh, the FM reception is pretty good as well."
4,Nike Triax Swift ADX Watch,"I generally liked this watch by reading others' review and seeing the images of it.It's different, it's unique and I found it pretty. I was very excited to order it, but when I received it I was surprised by its size: it's much larger and thicker than I thought and unfortunately the pics on the web did not reveal this.I was thinking about returning it, but I did not find any other watches that I could buy to replace this."
1,2011 Ford Fusion,"Although Amazon gurantees this blade fits the 2011 Ford Fusion, it does not! The connectors provided do not fit on the arm."
1,Rainex Wiper Blade,Couldn't use it! You sent me one that doesn't fit a Toyota Avalon. Had to go to auto supplystore and buy one that fits!!!
3,Quality build. Not a universal Fit,"I purchased this wiper for the rear window of my 2008 Nissan Pathfinder. The wiper is the correct size, but did not come with any universal adapter so it would not fit the custom mount on my car. I ended up having to pull the rubber out and put it in the old blade housing. It fit fine and was pretty easy, but thought a company like Rain-x would put the effort in to fit common vehicles."
4,Fit my Chevy Cobalt perfectly,"Works fine, but I like the Rain-X Latitude (Rain-X 5079279 Latitude 8-In-1 Premium Graphite Coated Wiper Blade - 22"") one I got for the driver side better. It's so much smoother and cleaner. The weather beater one does just fine, and honestly, if I hadn't gotten a latitude one also, I probably would have given it 5 stars."
5,Wiper works great,"Very easy to install. Great price. And of course Amazon shipping & packaging even better! Got the wiper, install is just a snap on my LR2. Works great specially during this weather season. I am a fan of Rain-X brand, specially with their wind-shield applicator. works great. Would recommend."
3,ugh!,good quality wipers however if you have grand am dont buy two of this one of them will be smaller than other one but works just great
2,Worst wipers I've ever owned,"I can't tell if it's this wiper or the other wiper (both are this RainX brand though) that are causing the problem but there's a large triangle int he middle of the windshield that doesn't get wiped at all. Also, the area the wiper does make contact with it very streaky. Instead of squeegee-ing it off the glass, it's just sort of moving it around. Never again RainX!"
4,Wiper,"It's a windshield wiper at a great price...no more, no less. Works well, but nothing earth shattering. It's hard to find the small sizes so this worked out fine."
5,Keeps window cleaner,"What an amazing wiper blade! My Ford Focus SE 2001 required this hard-to-find size for the rear window and Amazon was the only place. I'm glad I got this Rain-X.I can't speak for installation (husband helped me out there) but he seemed to install it in just a few minutes.When it's raining it seems like it helps the rain glide off, just like the chemical Rain-X treatment. It also cleans the window completely, not leaving streaks like some lower quality blades that I've had in the past.I've had them only for a couple months now so I don't know about durability through the winter, but so far so good. When my fronts go I want to replace them with Rain-X as well."
2,Does not fit Honda CRV,"I bought blades by the same brand for my Acura and I liked them, so I thought that I would get these for the CRV. The Amazon part finder said that they would fit the CRV, but they do not. The attachment handle is recessed and it caused the blade to butt up against the wiper arm."
4,Good wiper,"I bought a set of these on sale at a local automotive store and loved them, so when my other truck needed some I went online and glad I did. Much cheaper on Amazon. These things look a little big on your car, but they work AWESOME. I'd say they are a bit more durable than your standard wipers too. I'm in Florida so the sun and rain is hard on the rubber, but these hold up better than most I've used."
3,Does not fit a Prius rear wiper,Wiper was fine quality but did not fit a 2005 Prius rear window as advertised. Prius rear wiper has a unique mount.
2,"Re-reviewed, they're Just OK","NEW REVIEWAfter a short while they start squeaking badly, and don't work as well. I know wipers need frequent changes, but these are just ok, nothing special.OLD REVIEWThey're inexpensive, and if you follow the replacement schedule, then they work well. I find that these are the only ones that ""comfortably"" fit my 06 Honda Accord. All the others (Anco, Michelin, etc...) don't fit well because of this stupid little bracket that's on the car's wiper arm. I did notice that right around that 6 month replacement schedule, the performance quickly deteriorates, so as long as you replace often, then you're good to go. IF you're expecting something to last a year, then get ready for some streaks. They are on the cheaper/flimsy side for sure, but I haven't had one break yet!"
1,14' advantage for Toyota,"Although these wipers do work very good as I do have this product on the front of my auto, there are certain makes of cars that you can only get the rear wiper from the dealer. My Toyota 2003 Rav4 is one of those that for the rear 14' wiper blade is a dealer item only. I have heard the same for Subaru and I'm sure there are others. After ordering this and finding out it won't work, what do you do, do you return it? It cost to ship it both ways, which costs more than the original part in the end! so most people just eat the cost and then are stuck with a wiper blade that they can not use! So buyer beware, even if the search that Amazon has and which I used for the properly fitting blade says it fits on the rear of your auto, question it!"
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought the 20 inch blade for the driver side wiper and 18 inch for the passenger side wiper of my Honda Civic. The 18 inch seems to be working o.k. while the 20 inch does not work at all. As soon as I started using it, the blade would buckle and smear causing very little visibility. These blades are cheap, flimsy and dangerous. I returned it immediately. I will say Amazon was great in allowing me to return it."
1,didn't last long,"Typically, I seem to have to change the wiper blades once a year, but I got these wiper blades May 27, and they are already terrible in the rain (5 months on a secondary vehicle). This could be a fluke for these particular blades, but I am disappointed in their durability nonetheless.Moreover, the chemicals used in for the Rain-X aspecxt leaves a film on the winshield where where the blades stop before heading back towards the hood.I do like Rain-X for keeping the rain water beading when driving - many times I don't need to use the wipers that much, which under logic, would mean that should last a long time (minus sun and heat damage in the summer).I might just stick to Rain-X's other products . . ."
3,Fair,Fair product. I just can't seem to get a wiper for my back window that will clean as well as the front windows. It could be the wiper assembly.
4,Windshield wiper,"So far I have no complaints and along with rain-x windshield treatment and rain-x washer fluid I have to say that I have been very satisfied with the results and will continue treating with rain-x windshield treatment every three months and have read that this should result in double the lifetime of the windshield wipers,I'm happy:-)."
1,Does not fit 2007 Element EX,"Just like the title says. The blade is too wide to fit through the rear wiper arm. I ended up breaking it (yes, I know, stupid me) trying to get it to fit. Just be aware that if you have a slide-through wiper arm that this WILL NOT FIT."
1,not good,i had to buy another after this one because all it did was bounce around and not wipe. really shiiiity.
1,Misleading pictures and misinformation,"I have a 2003 Land Rover Discovery II and was weary about buying these wipers because it seems nothing ever fits my British truck. However, Amazon specifically said that this would fit. It did not. Not even close. The connection is too big.I also was expecting a few extra adapters as indicated in the pictures. One of them looks like it might have worked with my vehicle. However, NOT ALL OF THE ADAPTERS IN THE PICTURE COME WITH THE WIPERS. It specifically describes a slide lock mechanism on this site but there is nothing referring to that on the packaging.I hate when products are mislabeled and misleading. Even though it's cheap, I'm sending it back so Amazon can foot the shipping bill for the misleading details."
4,Excellent overview from the founding of the city,"Well-known Byzantine scholar gives us a concise one-volume treatment of a broad spectrum of life in the Byzantine Empire. Commerce, religion, military service, literature and art, town and country life, the administration and the art of law all find devoted chapters in this easy to read volume. For many of the smaller details, readers will have to go to Bury or Gibbon et al, but for an incisive survey into particulars, this book will serve."
3,Great small GPS unit!,"Great unit for the size, bluetooth is great no wires needed, decent battery life.The unit sometimes will not pickup sat lock, you have to wait a while or turn it off and back on again, but usually keeps a good lock once it gets it. Also location is important, needs to be out in the open and unobstructed to get a solid lock.If you need something that works every time you need it and 100% of the time and very quickly, go with another device. Unit can be a pain when it's not picking up a sat lock and you are in a rush."
3,Good but not great.,"I use this with my t-mobile dash and it works well. Was a bugger to get setup with google maps but it will work.Takes a while to get an initial lock on, especially if your are in a moving vehicle; but once locked on all is well."
2,So so,Pretty campy with cookie-cutter characters. The legion could (should) have been the main subject of the book but too many meaningless extras are thrown in (does anybody really care at all about the emperor in this book?) Too many angles are suggested and then never properly developed. Try as I might I just couldn't care what was going on. Only the Cyborgs evoked any real interest and they just weren't in it enough.Not quite ... but just barely above.
5,Clarity,"A fantastic book which really goes deep into telling what the salvation history stories of the bible are about. Dr. Hahn helps the reader in plain english to understand God's purpose in creation, and salvation. So much is lost through translation, and the passage of time, but the author has done the research and explains to the reader what the reader would otherwise miss. A great book for men and women highschool and up."
4,Useful for every christian,"This book is a good overview of the OT. It shows you the several convenants God made with his people, beginning with Adam. With this structure of the developing convenants in mind, you have a good theological map when reading the OT. Without clear structure the reading of the OT can make you sometimes mad (names, places, names, genealogies etc.). I used the information given in this book in an evangelical small group, where we try to give christian beginners an overview over the bible and christian theology. Despite the fact that Scott Hahn is a catholic, every christian can benefit from this book. It's not an apologetic book. At the end of the book I found it very interesting, what Jesus meant with ""it's finished"". I never thought about it in detail. Read it and decide for yourself."
5,Blessed!,I truly believe that this is their best alblum to date! POG's music has really blessed me over the years I have been listening to them. You can't go wrong with this CD.
5,AMAZING-GREAT 4 TURNING ON NEW FANS (I should know)!,"This is an AMAZING album. I have had it in my CD player for a month or so and I still absolutly can't believe how soothing this album is. This is the only POG album I have, but I expect that to change soon and I can't wait. I heard a lot of their other songs from other albums on the radio and from what I have heard this album tops all. I listen to it all the time and my favorites are definetly He Sends His Love, Blue Skies, Something So Good, and La, La, La. Actually they're all my favorites but if I had to choose it would probably be beetween Blue Skies and Something So Good. The others are By Heart, Praise Forevermore, Begin With Me, Free Indeed (so good), All That I Need, and Yes, I Believe. Also a totally sweet song called He Sends His Love. All in all this is a GREAT album and I reccomend it to everyone."
2,Not all I had hoped for,"I bought this as a replacement for a ""hand-made"" snack dispenser that I was using for ""fitness mix"" with nut, raisins, sunflower seeds, etc. This item is definitely more modern-looking and blends in well in the kitchen. However, I have to keep a cup under it at all times. For some reason, items ""leak"" out of the dispenser sometimes up to several minutes after someone has used it. It's a neat concept, it just needs to be ""tweaked"" a bit, unless perhaps I have a defective model."
2,Blaaaahggghh,How could a biography on the funniest person in the world be udderly terrible rather than udderly insane?! By writing a terribly contradictory unauthorized biography with basically no quotes and possible inaccurate information. Also assumption of Tom going hollywood! This Book Blows
1,Horrible waste of money!,"What a horrible waste of money these are, they are too small even the largest of the largest are too small, they don't stay on, they don't hold any liquidy material, the stuff gets all over the dog, the carpet, the house and you just blew away $15 buckos for absolutely nothing!"
2,doggy diaper,"I bought a medium for my dog, a wire fox terrier. I have the same complaint as another user-they don't fit from her waist to tail-the tail hole is in the wrong place for her-they definitely look like low risers. Aside from the fact that my dog won't move when she has them on -they come off as soon as he sits down so they are useless."
5,Hooray!,"Can't believe these actually work! Thought they would not be absorbent enough for our old dogs who have trouble ""holding it"" these days - but it's a great solution!"
3,Expensive and Not Really Reusable,"I take my dogs outside all of the time, including my pomeranian, who pees all over the house. We have never figured out why he pees - even the vet doesn't know. He's about 12 now, and that could explain it, except that he's been doing it for years. Anyhow, these diapers work, except that if you take them off to take the dog outside, you can't put them back on. And if you use more than one a day, it adds up quickly. I'm thinking I'll try premie diapers and cut the hole for the tail myself."
3,Ok but not great,"I've had the tripod for about 2 years. It is a good starter tripod, and has been durable. It does not support heavier equipment though and you'll have trouble keeping it steady with anything but smaller lens and DSLRs."
4,Metaphysical spin saves this from being schmaltzy,"In this edition with Zac Efron on the cover, one would expect the story to be saccharine & appealing to only a young, female demographic (not that there's anything wrong with that!). However, the well written and unique spin on the metaphysical aspects of the afterlife provide it with more than enough substance to transcend that genre...making it an entertaining read for fans of either ""Fantasy"" or ""Romance."""
4,Really enjoyed the read,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to read and overall a nice story. My only thing I would warn about is that the book discusses God a bit (but not enough to make it a religious read) and what happens after death. I know that some people have their own views and don't like to hear the views of others on this topic. Just something to keep in mind if you are that way. I thought the story was great and would definitely recommend the read.
4,Good Read,"Charlie St. Cloud: A NovelWhen I first started this book, I didn't think I would like it. I'm partial to stories that start fast and this one seemed to spend a lot of pages setting the reader up. But I continued reading because I was intrigued by the premise of a young man who had a foot in both the present and the afterworld.I'm glad I did. Once the throughline became established, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I thought it interesting that it was shelved in the YA section of my library. The story is definitely interesting to both young people and adults.Through a tragic accident, Charlie St. Cloud has the power to see and speak with the spirits in the cemetery where he works. His chosen career path is one born of a promise to his younger brother. Every chapter (after the first four) delivered a surprise and kept me wondering exactly where all this was headed.A good read and worth the time to pick your way through the slow beginning."
4,"Close, but not the original!","It has been about 30 years since I listened to this album. But even I can tell that some of these songs are not the versions on the original album. For the most part it's great... but there are moments of disappointment when someone's idea of a better arrangement has, for some reason, crept in. I'm one of Laura's biggest fans, and she was instrumental in keeping me on this earth. Messing with the original tracks is a bit like colorizing a black and white movie. Perhaps best left alone..."
1,Rip Off,"I ordered this before and package came with two decals, one for each side. This time only received one. What do I want one for?"
2,Where is the beef?,I don't understand why this book's rating is so high. On the back of the book it says the user level is intermediate-advanced. I think this book is for new users who have never used UNIX only. Also I feel the title is misleading. The design model is not explained well throughout the book and the author does not teach you how to think UNIX.
3,GROWING HEALTHY APPLES AND CHILDREN,"Written by the adopted grandson of Laura Ingalls Wilder this book chronicles a year in the life of young Rose Wilder. After their long pilgrimage east from the prairie, the family has survived their first year in the Ozarks, on lthier new place which they name Rocky Ridge Farm. In this 3rd book in the RR series Rose is almost nine, coping with conflicting loyalties to girlfriends (country versus town girls) and feeling the faint stirrings of jealousy. Throughout extremes of weather the Wilders offer a solid foundation of faith and charity toward their less fortunate neighbors. Continuing the girlhood mishaps of Laura's own life in the Little House books Rose amuses and entertains readers while learning valuable lessons about life, for human interaction is similarregardless of geographic environment. Tenderly cared for by her devoted parents, nurtured in faith, hope and compassion she will surely blossom as gloriously as the young apple orchard they cherish."
5,All ages love these drums,Got these for the kids to play and they all loved them. Kids love to bang on drums and these seem very sturdy. Big hit at the gathering. Even the adults wanted to play. Great purchase.
2,The radio that worked for 12 days.,"I liked the concept of this radio. It has 20 preset station capability and a remote control. However, after 2 days of operation, the remote quit working. On the 12th day, it quit working entirely! Bottom line - I think it is well designed but poorly manufactured."
2,"Looks great, doesn't follow through as well","This looks fabulous!! Everything about it is stylish. It even functions fine for me. My problem with it is the operation of it. The instructions to install were incorrect, the template they gave to mount the screws didn't match the screws on the unit, and the remote is bizarre. The buttons on the radio aren't named the same as the ones on the remote, so by the time you figure out how to operate it, you have to relearn how to do the same thing on the remote. It's completely strange, as though two different manufacturers made them.I wouldn't recommend you buy this."
1,No Joy,"Returned device, could not install in Win7 computer.Also tried Win XP computer with negative results."
3,Can't win them all,"An angry old crank looks back on a rare life with some bitterness and still blames almost everything wrong in the world on Nixon, the rest on W Bush. Far from Thompson's best stuff, like Hell's Angels, but there are enough gems in it to remind you why you could never resist his books in the first place. As with all of his writing, NOT for the faint of heart. If you haven't read him before, best not start with this."
5,My son loves it,"I gave this to my son for Christmas and he can't put it down. He likes being able to play without being ""wired"" to the playstation. He is able to use his with Guitar Hero II."
2,lacks functionality,"This guitar controller isn't bad for beginners, but advanced players will have difficulties with the fret buttons. They stick up farther and are harder to push than the Red Octane controllers. It's nearly impossible to slide your hands during fast passages.So it looks cool and is ok for beginners but advanced players should go for the Red Octane wireless controller. Sam's Club has it for $45."
3,Old technology - not easily used with GHII,Finally got it to work with GHII - came with adapters that have to be plugged in in front of the controllers' wireless receiver at just the right time during a reboot to use it with GHII. Kids say it works okay but this is a pain. Wish I had seen before I ordered.
3,"Sick? Nah, just misunderstood.................","""La Folie"" is just a tale about some Japanese student that practiced cannibalism. That's it. The ACT and the GUY was sick, but the album isn't just about cannibalism. It's witty, melodic and quite poetic. The classic ""Golden Brown"" is what sets the tone on this album. ""Let Me Introduce You to the Family"", is a romping, rhythmic sarcastic view of the dynamics of a family. My favorite song on this album. The new addition, ""Cruel Garden"", is a wonderful tribute to the music of Django Reinhardt, the great jazz guitarist. The keyboards, bass, Hugh Cornwall's (edited because facts are friends!) haunting and beautiful voice are the real stars. Buy this CD and ignore all the hype."
2,Two in a row Defective,"First one arrived with a scrolling snowy screen. Returned.2nd one arrived. Same but worse: the backlight comes on, but (and this is the ironic part) the information on the screen simultaneously disappears; plus the thing resets every few hours, deleting the weather info and setting the date to sometime in 2003. After one use. Can't return the 2nd now because 30 days have passed.Additionally, you might need to take the instructions with you when camping. I am a gadget freak and still find it difficult and not-at-all intuitive to change settings.Wouldn't recommend this to a friend. Am now looking at other brands: Suunto, Kestrel, etc."
1,Not suited for traveling,"I really had high hopes for these speakers. I have ALWAYS loved Sony gear and always found it performed to its name. I compared these speakers against other battery powered units, and found the specs on the box were all almost the same for 4xAA speakers. These things were the biggest dissapointment. Battery life seemed to be about 6 hours, compared to 30+ hours my friend got with his 4xAA speakers. If I tried to use it in a room with a fan or air conditioner running, it couldnt be heard over the noise of the unit. If I tried to use it outside, simple noises like cars driving by or people talking drowned it out. It was as if I plugged in headphones and turned it up as high as I could in hopes it could be heard.I have switched to my friends brand, which I wont mention here. I dont want it to appear I am trying to plug another brand- I really do just hate these speakers."
4,TV VIDEO,IM GLADE I NOW HAVE THIS SEASON OF WALKER TEXAS RANGER AND HOPE THE OTHER SEASONS WILL BE RELEASED SOON
4,Great Product - but let's be clear: This is NOT for beginners.,"I bought this product to brush up on my French since I do not have as many opportunities to speak, read and write with/in it since graduating college a few years ago. This product is designed for someone who has attained a fairly advanced ability with the language who is out of practice with it for one reason or another. I would imagine this product might be too advanced for someone who has had only one year of college/university training (or the secondary school equivalent) in the language.Having said that, I have found this package to be great. The readings and audio exercises have brought me back to an advanced level of understanding. But like with any language program, regular practice is key. So for this program to be as effective as possible, daily (or nearly daily) practice is absolutely necessary - even if only for 20, 30 mins."
2,didn't like book,"Based on the reviews by others, I bought this book. Unfortunately, there is nothing in it I would really want to wear other than the front cover project. So, I am returning it to Amazon. I have Wiseman's knitting with wire book and like it much more."
3,"Good action description, above average storylines","The story is about the the famous detectives, Frank & Joe Hardy fight to protect wresterler, Sammy. In the process of narrowing down their suspect list of who may be sending threatening notes and attempting to hurt Sammy, the Hardys find themselves in difficult positions too."
3,cheap illumination,Clock is quite handsome but the illuminated dial is cheap looking - makes the dial look like a thin piece of paper with a blue light peering out from the center of the hands. It is probably going back.
3,"Great, while they last","I love these headphones; unfortunately I have owned 4 pairs in 2 years. The plastic is very brittle and the handband always breaks near one of the 3 elbow joints. Too bad, because no other style compares to the comfort and portablility for running and the gym."
1,Very Unhappy,"I ordered this for my son for his birthday because he just had to have it. I was leary about ordering it online, but I read the reviews and description and it looked OK. I should have gone with my first instinct. The helicopters run time was very limited, which made the fun factor not there, because you had to keep stopping to recharge. The part where you pulled in the charger broke about the 3rd time we hooked it up, and the material of construction was very poor. I read my invoice and found out that I could not return it for a refund. very unhappy"
4,The Fairy Remote Control Helicopter is Fun,"This product is a nice toy to have. That's especially true if you have a basketball court in which to fly it. We don't, but the church next door does, and this thing is great fun. It's a bit tricky getting the trim working right, and it's a bit unpredictable in flight, but it's still a blast to fly."
1,Dont waste your money,"""Santa"" bought one from a mall kiosk. Paid $29.95 + tax for a piece of junk that never lifted off of the floor. Would love to know who manufactured this product. Not looking to get my money back (I'm a realist), but so a 7-yr old can vent his feelings towards one of Santa's elves."
1,Very dissapointed!,"The helicopter didn't fly, it only moved sideways. I've been trying to return the product since January 2 with no success."
1,Not a good contemporary romance,"I had to take this book back to the library without finishing it because the characters really started to annoy me. One of the things that makes contemporary romances fun to read is that the characters are real people. They have flaws, like everyone else. This book was about two perfect people, with their two perfect lives, get together. There was no mystery...what you expected to happen, happened."
4,Great CD!,"When I saw that Laura Nero was accepted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her song writing, I was curious about the songs she wrote. By the time the tribute was over, I was amazed at the volume of great songs she penned. I had to get this CD to experience the songs in her own voice. They are great and she was a writer worthy of this award."
4,One Star Short,"There are not so many available LN albums that you should buy compilations at all. Eli, Tendaberry, Christmas and the Beads of Sweat, Gonna Take a Miracle, and Smile are all song cycles -- the first three especially, and the order shouldn't be changed or chopped up. The shape of each album is an important part of its art. Eli, Tendaberry, and Christmas are psychic, spiritual odysseys. Follow her tracks and she'll lead you through with the best views and the least damage, like any good guide. p.s. The first album (The First Songs) isn't in it. It's just a lot of wonderful songs, but it's only a collection, not a voyage."
3,Too Boston Centric!,"I wanted to like this book but was disappointed in it. There are 135 miles of the Mass Pike. About 10 or 12 miles of the road are inside Route 128 but out of 120 or more pages in the book about 80 deal with those 10 or 12 miles. For a Western Mass resident like me, that was disappointing but not surprising. We're used to it. Boston is the only place in Mass that matters to some people. Perhaps the most Dramatic structure on the entire Pike is the Westfield River Bridge. It's 150 feet high or more but you don't see that in this book. You don't see it when you drive over it either. It's at the bottom of the steep decline pictured in the book in Russell. You don't see the Bridge unless you get off the Highway and view it from U. S. Route 20, the road the Pike replaced. It is quite dramatic but totally absent from this book. The book is poorer for it."
5,I loved being obsessed with my dead wife XD,"Well, it's pretty much true once you play Silent Hill 2. I was really captivated by the story of James looking for his deceased wife that sometimes I forgot that I was playing for such a long time! The music/sound matches the atmosphere perfectly (i.e. walking around in a underground prison cell, Brookhaven, etc.)And not to mention PH! So don't be shy when it comes to reccommending this game. (Heck, I even heard that some college professors make their students write essays on this game!) That's how great this game is. Though, I don't really reccomend this to people who get scared easily (though you can use this as a reason why you still use a night light). The game play may not really challenging, but even if you're a hardcore ""OMGihatesilenthillcozRErockslololol!!!!111oneoneone"" ...give it a try. It won't hurt ya.;)"
1,Unbelievably poor shipping standards,"I received the desk I ordered within only a few days, but to my disappointment, the condition of the package upon arrival was unacceptable. The package looked like it had done a tour of duty in Iraq. The Fed Ex rep even commented on the substandard shipping given the size and weight of the desk. Upon opening the package to inspect the product, I found that two key pieces of the desk had been damaged to the point that they were unusable. I have promptly returned the desk and hope the replacement is handled better. Shame on you Target. Pay a little more attention to your customers."
5,"Solid desk, attractive and functional design. East to assemble, too.","This desk was easy to assemble and is very sturdy and attractive. It's perfect for laptops, which is how I use mine. The bottom shelves serve very nicely for books; I like to keep some folders on the top shelves.The design is quite elegant: basically two sawhorses hold a perfectly sized desk surface. It is heavy enough to be stable but not too heavy. It's just right.It was delivered in a large box. I opted to open mine on the porch and then carry in each piece separately. I'd recommend doing that because the box is bulky. It was a bit battered from the delivery process, but the desk is packed nicely and protected well.Great value for the money. I recommend this desk."
4,Jackpot!,"I liked it a lot. Not really really hearing the Nesmith influence, sounds more like Boyce/Hart on acid (Out and About?). Good harmony sound, pretty good quality production, (not overproduced though), guitar, bass and drums meld well in this LA sunshine rock. This is a fine album, they did not have a hit single in them however, probably why nobody has heard of them."
5,Great Book,"Wish it would have come out earlier, I could have saved tons of money. Very well written, easy to read and has a wealth of information."
5,Perfect options trading gameplan,High Octane Trading was an excellent read. I highly reccomend this book to equity traders who desire to trade options with confidence. After studying this book I have developed a comprehensive game plan and the confidence to begin trading options.
3,What Octane?,"This book should be re-titled to ""Trading's Little Instruction Book"". It is giving you some really useful general advice (""bread and butter strategies"") to make you feel good and smart, but lacks any details, depth and specifics to make you feel certain or knowledgeable about anything. It takes you on a dizzying ride that gets you feel nauseated like a carousel. From the usual ""you are good enough"", ""money for capital is everywhere"" beginning we get to be blinded by the riches of options trading, then we read about the psychology of trading, study the psychology of the market, get a glimpse of technical analysis and market indicators, just to conclude our journey with ""25 Ways to Improve Your Trading Now"".It is unfortunate that at the end this book ignores its own warning No. 11 ""Do not be Jack of All Trades, the Master of None."""
5,A wonderful read.,"Clay Brown does a wonderful job at both bringing the characters to life as well as giving the reader a sense of being there. Watching this young man transition from a place where many of us have come from, young, no real direction or goals, then finding our way through a chance encounter with someone or someplace and a career is born. If you have worked in the utility business, this story will be very familiar and bring back many memories of people places and things you've done and been through. If you've never worked in this business, you will enjoy a great story and learn much about those wires and the men and women who build and maintain them and gain an instant connection to the lives described in this story."
4,Kids are having fun and so are the cats.,I bought this for my 19 month old grandson. It took him a little while to get the hang of it. My 4 year old grandson showed him how to do it and my 17 month old granddaughter. They are now having a lot of fun with it and hide in it.
3,Doesnt help that much,The guide doesnt help that much. It just shows maps and tells you stratigies. If you are good at beating video games like MOH Rising sun it probably wont help.
4,"ok quality, great design","This is the best wire-stripper design, infinetely adjustable and comfortable to pull (unlike common wire strippers witha fixed set of holes, which also you have to pull while holding perpendicular to the wire).SK Facom makes a similar design superb quality tool, but it's hard to find in the US. This one here is a medium quality tool (the two ""claws"" don't exactly touch each other throughout the range of motion as they should if they had tight tolerances), but does the job fine."
1,One of the brake line fitting does not fit factory fitting,"This is the second brake master cylinder I purchased at Amazon. One of the brake line fittings, the one closer to the firewall, is larger than the factory fitting, so try and find a fitting adaptor, or change the fitting on the existing one is a nightmare, so I just went to the auto part store and bought one, but I got to look at the whole thing before I bought it, this time I bought a Dorman, everything fits like the OEM. At least Raybestos should include an adaptor fitting. Just wasted my money."
3,Typical Harmon/Kardon,No clear directions included. You need Geek squad to set up. But once you do get it running it has been good.
2,Not enough of the funky blues that the world needs,"This album is better than the Doctor's last effort but still...he doesn't deliver that same emotion that he gives off when playing live. To truly experience this man, this legend (indeed, a legend), you simply need to see him play out. Smith's music is taken in so much better by being there, watching, listening...Live's the word."
2,Eveylyn tea for one set,Not one of Tracy Porters prettiest tea for one sets. The colors are so muted . There is no painting on the inside of the cup that is usual for her work. Just Blah!
5,Riding Tornado,"If you're a horse lover, you'll love it! Good buy for young and old alike. You just can't go wrong buying on Amazon!"
3,Misleading,"I have not yet used this book for my class, but I thought this would be the entire book PLUS workbook, but it was only the workbook. I will have to order the book now too."
5,A nice job!,"I was happy with my books, i got them on time. I will definitely buy again when i need to. Thanks!"
3,Duo 1mg chip and Adapter,"Although the card works fine and the price was right, the cost of the postage was far higher than the actual postage paid to the sender and affixed on the plain envelope letter that it arrived in. I feel that if correct postage paid were used, I would have recieved it much sooner.Also, the memory card had 300 photos still on it, which took a long time to erase, burning out a set of batteries."
2,Misleading picture,I saw the adapter and thought it was a part of the package. You need the adapter to use the memory stick in most computers I was really disappointed when I received it today. The shipping was super quick but with out the adapter that is shown in the picture this card is worthless to me. I'm Suggesting taking the adapter out of the picture seeings as you are only selling the stick by its self or stating the adapter in the picture is sold separately.
1,Yuck !!,"Poor, boring, undocumented, has no music excerpts. To be fled at all costs. Tell your friends to stay away. Trust me. I love the Dixie Chicks and this is deserves the waste basket."
2,Not happy jam.,"Due to the poor packaging the gold coating on creamer's handle got rubbed off badly, I was going to get it replaced but it was out of the stock, so now I have to find something replace it on Ebay, how disappointed :("
5,Excellent Reference Book!,"I am having a pond build and needed a comprehensive book of aquatic and bog plants that are suitable for Koi ponds. Everything is there at your fingertips. The color plates are wonderful as well as the descriptions. The only downside, it that I wished the authors would have a listing of the fragrant hardy and tropical waterlilies. Other than that, this book is a beauty!"
4,AN EXCELLENT MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR,"As the author of the newly published PSYCHIC BATTLEFIELD (St. Martin's Press 2/2000) Shnabel's work was of great utility in doing the background research. With a great degree of literary skill, and for the most part, accuracy, this book is an excellent modern history of psychic spying, although it was published prior to much new information being declassified. For the complete story, I recommend my work."
3,If you truly want minimalist and traditional . . .,"Have too many empty rooms? Than this is the book for you. I will agree that this book was beautiful and interesting in historic architectural aspect, but if you are looking to incorporate some asian design themes into your current residence, I wouldn't recommend it. I found this book to be many examples of the same thing - an almost empty room with a screened doorway. There were some interesting gardens, but unless you are actually planning on throwing away all of your furniture (or you don't have any yet) I found it not very beneficial. Nothing wrong with this book - but felt it necessary to point this out to potential buyers as the book is appropriately pricey and the ideas hard to adapt to an already western home."
3,"Pretty color, but not so comfy on the shoulders","Nice color bra. Just My Size are well made products, this bra just didn't do it for me. The straps don't hold their adjustment and by the end of the day, they've moved so things aren't as ""supportive"" as they should be."
1,"My size, but not my style","I like the color and feel of this bra, but the shape is far too pointy for my liking. It looks strange under most shirts."
4,Listening Pleasure,"Compact easy to use machine, that gives good quality sounds on the move. Economical on batteries it give excellent value for money."
3,There was more to this story...,"If you watched season 2 of HBO's Project Greenlight you know that the writer of ""The Battle Of Shaker Heights"" wrote more than just a 79 minute movie. The filmmakers turned the film into something much less than it was on paper. There were so many scenes that were shot, that were deleted from the final cut (which has many movie fans asking ""Where is the deleted scenes on the DVD"") Yes, (cutting scenes) this is true for any movie and you might say all movies don't have 12 episodes on the making of... that show you what you're missing. So perhaps Project Greenlight hurt the film more than it helped it. Still in all anyone would have been able to see that this movie is missing something. What it isn't missing is a great character and an even better performance from Shia La Beouf. His work is the high light of the movie. THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS received mixed reviews, but everyone can agree Shia La Beouf is a fine actor and his work here will be easy to remember."
3,amusing (kids) annoying (grownups),"This Psalty video is loved by my children (age 2-5). They ask for it on a regular basis. It includes lots of neat songs. However, the big blue song book and other characters are annoying to me as a grown up. The whole thing is dumbed down. I keep it only because the kids like it so much."
4,Nice step by step guide,"I enjoyed this book. It is a quick read, with very simple steps. At times, I felt David Bach glossed over certain steps and made them appear a bit easier than they actually are (i.e. making sure you have sufficient savings before jumping into purchasing a primary or secondary property). Overall, however, he addresses the seriousness of the homebuying process, and most importantly encourages his readers to begin the process."
1,Repackaged Garbage,"The information in this book is nothing new. Nothing you couldn't get from ""How to buy a Home for Dummies"" (I made the title up). I was bored."
3,"A bit dated, but not bad","Not a bad book, however he talks a lot about how you don't need any money for a down payment, and he talks about 80/15/5 loans which really are a thing of the past, and were probably not any good to begin with. Overall his recommendation and stories about making money in real estate are very inspirational."
2,Unfamiliar voice better suited for children's books,"I was incredibly disappointed by the new book. Not so much by the repetitious content that I've come to expect from the Bach books (there's always enough new content to make them worthwhile). No, I was disappointed by the voice/reader of the Automatic Millionaire Homeowner audio CDs. Not only is he not as animated as David, his various voices are horrible. Every time he does a girl's voice, I want to throw up. If this were a children's story, it would be fine. But this is supposed to be a book for adults. Bach made a huge mistake deviating from his tradition of recording his own reading of his books. If you're going to get this book, get the paperback or at least be prepared for a VERY different listening experience."
2,Handful but almost useless,"First of all my complains are not targetted to the customer service, since it was as expected: responsive and the promised delivery time was real. My complain goes all to a product where the only feature is good handfullness, period. I expect from a keyboard to produce a tone while pressing a key - I wasn't expecting a dynamic touch-sensitive sofisticated electronic piano device with sustain pedal or other shiny features, but just a plain click-and-ding one and this is not the case. To hope to produce a sound you got to stretch and fix very very well the rubber tape on a perfectly plane and hard surface, then strike with full force your fingers in the clean center of the key and, 8 times to 10 you get your note. Outside these parameters you get nothing. Really really frustrating expecially for a beginner so my advice is: forget handfullness and do not buy this kind of useless device."
1,"Too much Country, Not enough Rock 'n Roll","I bought this album after I read a stellar review in the Boston Globe. I was dissappointed. Although a sincere musician, Todd Thibaud is essentially a country music artist. The review made it sound like it was a rock/pop album.It's not. I am not a big fan of country music."
4,My first buy,"I didn't still receive my product, but I am very happy for you they be worrying about my purchase, this is the first time that I make a purchase online in Amazon.with and I had a certain fear in doing purchases in international sites, more now I am safer. But so that I can really indicate this site for my friends and family, I need to receive my request."
3,OK anime,"While the anime has nice quality graphics, the story is fairly generic: middle school kids saving the world from evil invaders. I would recommend renting it first before buying. Oh, and the story doesn't really get any better. The entire series is fairly generic."
3,Gate Keepers,"GateKeepers: Japanese Animation SeriesIt's 1969, and Japan is in the middle of a large economic boom. Yet secretly, mysterious beings called ""Invaders"", are infiltrating Japan at an alarming rate. The Earth Defense Organization A.E.G.I.S. has a secret weapon to battle the invaders - Ikusawa Izuniko, a schoolgirl who can open a dimension to another world and draw supernatural powers from it to fight. Later, another GateKeepers Named Ukiya Shun(the main character), joins A.E.G.I.S.GateKeepers is one of the highest quality series to come out of Japan in a while. The 2D Animation is great. And with the fact that there probably wasnt transforming armored van technology in the 60's, Its good enough to rise above mediocre anime titles. Just watch and find out."
1,just ok,"ok, I love Chaka, but this is horrible. I listen to it once,and was like WTF. She is not even trying to sing on this CD. I thought her last CD with Prince ""Come into my house"" was great. I like her jazz songs,but this CD is her worst. Maybe this is the best we will get out of her now."
5,"It's different, It's new and refreshing and it's Chaka","I have been a fan of Chaka's since she came on the scene in 1973. I was a little upset when I heard she was doing a cd of standards because I wanted so much to hear the wails and the outstanding background vocals she is capable of producing. However, after one listen to this CD, I realized Chaka can sing anything. Crazy, Hazel Hips, Teach Me Tonight, Round Midnight and the touching I Believe are my favorites. I'm not going to compare, Chaka to Anita,Regina or any other artist. Chaka does Chaka and no one can deny that Chaka vocal skills are amazing."
4,Chaka does a great job with some classic songs,Chaka does a great job with classic songs. I don't agree with all her artistic choices but she definitely puts her distinctive mark on these songs.
5,"My son's fave ""in the car"" book","This very cute, repetitive story is one of my son's favorite stories. The story is silly but easy to follow for preschoolers. We've read the book so many times together that he ""reads"" it to himself in the car and keeps his sister entertained too."
3,"Good, not God","This isn't a bad album, not at all. In fact, many of the tunes are consistent and energetic. Stagnant Waters is my personal fave. But...and of course there's a but...it just doesn't measure up to Press or Chumps on Parade. Sorry. I've been big on MU330 since the early St.Louis days of Salamander Stew (find that one!) and this album just doesn't have the standout humor and leaping-out vocals or instrumentation that their earlier ""Stuff"" had. This album is still better than the majority of what passes for ska these days. I recommend you check out the new album ""Change Up"" by fellow Missourians, The Skalars, for more old schoolin' ska."
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"This was my only text for a semester course in Assembly Programming. I failed the course. Miserably. The author jumps around all over the place, using advanced concepts in early examples with no explanation whatsoever. nor does the book follow a logical plan of building in one chapter on what was taught in the previous chapter. the completely non-linear design and 'flow' of the book condemn it to being virtually unintelligible to beginners such as myself."
1,A Disgrace to the programming community.,"I am currently enrolled in an assmebly language course in college, and this text book is a complete pile of trash. The author tries to make himself feel better, by talking his knowledge on a basis of expertise, when in fact, this is for beginners. He acts as though he is the god of ASM, and that his readers should look up to him. He jumps around all over the place, like he is high on acid. I failed my ASM course, and i will be taking it next semester, due to this pile of (...junk) you call a ""book"". I will drop this book off at the local trash can (...)."
1,DVD poor performance,"I purchased a new (I hope) Toshiba DVD player. The 1st one I received made a severe grinding noise when it was turned on. I returned it for another one (new I hope). That one worked fine for about a week. Now when a DVD disk is inserted into any holder the display constantly reads ""NO DISK"". I'm going to return it for full credit to my account. Too bad, Consumer Reports gave it a very good rating."
3,The 5 Disk Player That Wasn't.,"...i think that aside from the design which makes this device look like a spray painted brick, it's not a terribly bad DVD player. It has some excellent features for the price.However, I may return it this week though as everytime it plays a disk and that disk finishes, it simply...stops.There's no feature to address or change this amongst a sea of useless features...My Harmon Kardon that is 10 years older does all this and much faster.This is the most idiotic shortcoming of all mentioned from other reviewers - from the miniscule Pause button to wacky controls needed to change, skip and ex-change (sic) discs. If it can't play sequentially, the disks that are loaded, then it becomes merely a bulky DVD/CD storage facility.Pointless, really..."
5,The Swiss Army Knife,"The fieldmaster by Victorinox has all the blades I want in a knife and the quality one would expect from Victorinox. For those who do not know what the hook on the bottom is for... it is for carrying a load with a cord handle so the cord won't cut into your hand, or grabbing the wire handle of a hot pot off a fire without burning yourself. This knife makes the crossover from woods to urban environment."
1,Drop it once and it breaks.,"I bought one of these at a big-box store, figuring its large blade would be a plus. Unfortunately, dropping it once into my bathtub showed how flimsily attached the handle was.I replaced it with an OXO, which has been quite good."
1,Fragile junk,Have to agree with the previous view - one drop on the shower floor and the handle snapped. A shame - otherwise it looked nice and worked rather well.
1,nice for approximately one week,This squeegee lasted approximately one week before the rubber came unglued from the metal handle. Don't buy it!
4,Implausible but fun to read,"I didn't want to put the book down. The storyline was farfetched but still so well done. It was a welcome relief, with plenty of stuff to make you laugh - and enough sex to keep you satisfied."
2,worst tasting supplement I've tried!,"I tried. I tried several times. I give up. This stuff is completley unpalatable! I have tried many supplement powders. I drink a daily green superfood supplement. And even that one I can get down with water. First of all, 4 TABLESPOONS?? Wow, no wonder there's only 15 servings in a container. I have only been able to gag down two tablespoons at once, AND had to add extra liquid/juice. I used 1 part water, and 1 part Odwalla Superfood (which is sweet and delicious) Still almost vomit-enducing. This is my first try with 'hemp' protein powder. I was really looking for a good one. This IS NOT it."
3,Nice pop which reminds of other songs,"I plan to buy this album soon, based on what I've heard.I first heard David when his song ""Only in the Movies"" was played in season two of the TV Show 'Ed'.I do like the song but it kept niggling at me that it reminded me of something else.I finally clicked that the melody/chords and Davids voice on the song are very much like Stephen Bishop and his song 'Madge' (from Bishop's album ""Careless"" in 1977). Nothing wrong with that though :)""Girl on the Roof"" is also very poppy and cool and shows off his voice. As others here have said, the songs sound very Wings-era McCartney.So, if you like McCartney, Bishop and Elton John, you'll most probably like this album :)da5id"
4,Great for standing desks,I got this after I started using a sit/stand desk at work and the yoga mat wasn't cutting it. This is a step above the yoga mat!
4,Painful Redemption,"Ward's debut novel is a bleak and stirring portrayal of how the effects of crime ripple through several decades afterward. The story is told from three perspectives--one, from the girl no one loved until she met Charles Starkweather; two, from the boy left an orphan after his parents were murdered; and three, from a local girl who's life was forever altered by watching the orphan boy and imagining his lonely life.Her writing style is brief and thoughtful, and she is able to portray her three narrators in distinct fashions so that we can easily follow when one stops and another begins. Her characterizations are very real, and sadness is woven into an overall wintry, grey, and desolate background that is effective and powerful. There is a theme of abadonment and aloneness that permeates the novel; and although there is love and redemption at the story's conclusion, this is a chilly and scary walk through a story of true crime and its imagined effects on those touched by its wake."
2,disappointed,"I had high hopes for these because I love A1 Sauce, but I didn't think the flavor carried through properly. Too much vinegar for my taste. I'll stick with the teriyaki and the peppered nuggets!"
2,beautiful but not stable,"This shoe is as beautiful as it looks, but it runs 1/2 to 1 size small and the bottom of the platform is very narrow, making it difficult to walk. I sent them back, and Amazon paid for the shipping both ways."
1,"Great telescope( ( ETX-60AT ), absolutely lousy tripod.","I purchased an ATX-60At telescope for my wife about 1 year ago. I purchased a tripod 3 months later.The tabs securing the height of the legs broke that evening. I took it back to the Meade dealer for a replacement.Before taking this second tripod home I asked the dealer to try the securing tabs to make sure they are O.K. All 3 tabs broke as the dealer tested it in the store in front of me and other customers.My wife's telescope has had little use since. What a sad story. Meade should be ashamed of how they foist a telescope ( Albeit a good one) on people and then it becomes a dust gatherer because the tripods are useless!Hopefully Meade is working on a replacement solution so buyers can feel good about the telescope they purchase.Ted Pokorski,Kalamazoo, MI"
2,Disappointed!,"I have learned so much through reading and listening to Gregg Braden, but this DVD was simply not entirely my cup-of-tea. It was recorded years ago, which is not in the description of the product, and I was disapointed. Additionally, some of the sudject matter is something I will have to seriously ponder."
5,Eclectic Mix for the fine folks at BBE,"This is a mix of Funk, House, Hip Hop and Psycodelic tunes that populate a number of BBE's records. This is a great CD for chillin around the house or in a bar. Essential for any well rounded music fan. Not mainstream!"
3,I really do love PKD...,"...but I honestly don't think this is one of his stronger works. In all truth, a lot of the surreal, subjective- reality business here felt almost like a parody of Dick's usual territory. (""Here are some characters. Their reality keeps shifting, and they never know what is and is not true. Watch them bumble around confusedly""). It seemed kinda...routine. Mind you, an average PKD novel is still brilliant by anyone else's standards, but compared to opuses like Do Androids Dream... and UBIK, I feel The Three Stigmata is a bit lacking."
4,Can-D vs. Chew-Z: Transubstantiation and Hallucination,"Far off on inhospitable planetary colonies, volunteers ""chosen"" by the UN make their lives bearable by chewing a drug called Can-D, which temporarily transports them into the life of the doll Perky Pat. The drug becomes a kind of religion, with fanatic users arguing that they really are transported into Perky Pat's world and that the experience constitutes a kind of Holy communion. Meanwhile, Palmer Eldritch returns from his ten year journey bearing a new kind of drug-- Chew-Z-- a competitor to Can-D. He claims that while Can-D promises a new life Chew-Z can actually provide it. However, there seem to be more than a few catches...A book that deals with Dick's perennial obsessions-- God, the nature of reality, and the experience of the Holy. The ending gets a little too tangled for this to be one of his best works."
2,Fascinating yet disturbing,"This was my first encounter with Philip K. Dick, the prolific sci-fi writer. His writing is confident, straightforward, and manages to make the distant future recognizable and believable. I enjoyed the plot - it wove together a number of separate storylines and included a bit of mystery - but felt that at the end of the book the author was trying too hard to say ""something important"" about the nature of reality and eternity. The story wasn't strong enough to carry weighty philosophical ideas; it began to seem a bit far-fetched, but it did make me think."
3,"good toy for prams, above the cots, chewing","good toy for prams, to hang above the cot, for baby's chewing needs. Attractive & colorful."
2,Not as strong as my baby,"We use these links to hang toys from my daughter's jumperoo and high chair. When she pulls on the toys, the links bend out of shape easily. They are not as strong as some of the other brand links we were given by friends. Looking at what the other reviews have said, I definitely would not let her use them as a teething toy, but we mostly use wooden or natural rubber teethers anyway."
2,I'm holding out for the next one,"I love Ani Difranco, so I was very disappointed in this album. It seems like a sloppy collage of her previous work, except that this is uninspired and boring. And BORING is not a term i would ever have used for Ani before. There's not even a song here that sticks in my head to hum to! So i'm giving her two stars even though I would just given her one if this were to stand on its own, because knowing Ani, this is probably just a lull."
3,the song begins again,"I listened to this album and thought that it didn't have a real mood to it. her other albums always had different styles that blended together to create something you could feel. the mood on upupupblahblahblah is kind of obscure, but nonetheless i like it a lot especicially the song Jukebox. ok, enough of what i think bye"
4,at least it's not pop!,"ok, ok...it may not be her best...well, it's definitely not her best, but at least she refuses to NOT sell out like everyone else. (Jewel, Alanis) I mean, where else r u gonna hear beautiful, mournful songs about racism and steel plant towns and personal past and present AND funky free-verse nonsense. I still think she is absolutely the most talented singer-songwriter-producer-owner-etc. out there!!"
2,She has been better,"I love Ani's music, but this CD is lacking... She tends to produce CDs that correspond with where she is in life and what is buggin her today! Well, I am guessing shes not in a very good place right now...."
3,Is this folk music?,"well this cd is a little on the edge of techno and maybe i am being selfish, but i want ani to be the same old ani that i heard 4 years ago at the best folk festival that i have been to. i guess i am scared of change so this album doesnt intrest me too much."
5,little helper,"I have double jointed thumbs which can make holding pressure points or holding on to a muscle nodulation down right painful. This little tool takes all that away, I can hold those points for as long as I want til they are gone without causing me any pain!"
4,Good. But understand there is only one!,This works and works well. However the picture is misleading. It shows two but you are only getting one. Seems that the price is too high.
3,Bales not pads!!,"Paid twice as much for pads instead of bales and got bales. The pads fit in a frame with a weight that I have. The bales do not. Product I ordered was substituted with something I didn't want. There was no communcation from seller, about substitution.PS Packing barley straw bales in styrofoam peanuts is unnecessary and not cool, dude."
5,used as door sealant on BMW E39,"if you have water coming through the door, it's likely that the seal of the vapor barrier is broken. This stuff is a great way to fix this problem. Just remember to wear gloves, it is very sticky on the metal and your fingers as well..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"I have one of these pieces of crap and it is riddled with inferior technology that fails constantly. This thing has been broken down every year that I have owned it, I refuse to spend any more money on it. The moving parts in it WILL fail, the lamp lasts a year, I have had some very expensive parts replaced and now it shuts off whenever it wants to. I contacted samsung about it and they gave me the virtual finger over the phone and flat out said they wouldn't offer me any assistance at all. I paid $3,000 for this piece of garbage brand new, I will never buy another samsung product again, something to keep in mind when you are shopping for electronics and appliances, they don't care."
1,Sick Book,"We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some yearsback and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men andinability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her viewof women isn't much better in that they are supposedly thepoor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such adistasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is theaggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willingvictim to only get children and love in return.If she can't seethe pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers.Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why somepeople bother to read such books because it's a waste oftrees,paper and time!Another problem is she makes it sound as though women wholike intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as thoughshe has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse.She tries to make very subjective material sound like it'ssupposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!!Very dangerous book."
1,"0 stars is the real rating, but that's unavailable","This is the dumbest book out there. Like some others said here previously, this book's premise is as logical as Hitler's in 'Mein Kampf'--no wonder women like her are referred to as ""feminazis""! This woman is totally clueless not only about the central issue of male sexuality, but her own as well."
3,Typical Hardy Boys Action,"""The Mystery of the Black Rhino"" takes the Hardy Boys, Frank and Joe, to Africa where they get involved in smashing an international poaching scheme.The story lags in the beginning, especially in a ludicrous subplot which has the Boys saving an airliner from crashing.Once they get to Nairobi, the action is non-stop and carries the reader right along to the rather disappointing and predictable climax.In spite of its flaws, I enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting."
3,Too large and a bit on the heavy side,"I ordered a large, since I wear large in everything else. The sleeves are the right length but the ""large"" designation apparently means that it was designed for a large sumo wrestler. At about 2 pounds, it's awfully heavy to lug around in a backpack (the $6 rain poncho it was intended to replace weighed less than half as much), so something a little snugger would have been preferable. But it's so inexpensive that it's not worth the cost of shipping it back to the seller."
1,Most OVER rated actress,Funny I thought I was the only one who noticed she lisps!!And yes she is the poster child for 'Nepotism'
1,A Bio About What???,"I saw this book recently at a bookstore,and I just have to comment--what has Paltrow done to warrent a biography, other than make movies? I am amazed at the zeal in which we worship people whose only claim to fame is that they've made a movie, or modeled lipstick in a magazine. As an actor, her talent is average at best, so the book can't even harp on that. Sorry to Paltrow fans, but this kind of stuff really grates on me. Please go and read bios of people who have made an impact in our world, who have done something great, novel, overcome hardships, etc..."
1,Who cares! Books are borring,"Download and research for movie maker effects, I found some decent transitions and title effects for movie maker :)"
3,Good Product - But Comes Without Clamps,"I am happy I ordered this product from Amazon.Just be aware that no clamps are included with the product. So you may need to buy/find 2 clamps.Would I buy it again from Amazon? Yes, indeed."
3,Ok for a starter drum,"I had never played a Bodhran before so I didn't want to spend alot of money , But if you can afford it buy a good drum buy a real drum maker and buy a tune able one. This one has a high pitch to it and comes with a rough skin. I had to sand the the drum and tape it as well and now it sounds alot better. I will be buying alot better one before to long."
4,"Great Anime, A Must Own Classic","It really shows the horrors of war and how war can change you. It has a good story and is just enjoyable. Kind of ends out of nowhere though, but still has a good ending. If you are a fan of anime and do not own this one, you should pick it up."
5,Medieval at its best!,"Close your eyes and imagine a world of fantasy, honour and valor: The world of King Arthur, Merlin and the Knights of the round table. Play this Cd in the background and you're there! Truly magical score for an equally great tv series. Comprised of the best music for a TV Miniseries, this cd will allow you to recreate the magic and myth of Merlin. Melodic catchy tunes inspired by upper England traditional music, the songs in Merlin really capture the essence and soul of an era and faithfully recreate a time I wish we were living :)"
2,"flawless technique, forgot about the music","I should say at the outset, I am a big fan of Holdsworth's '70's work. With a little maturity I've realized that artists often need to exercise restraint. Holdsworth is now ""free"" to do what he wishes and the music suffers. This is technically flawless, but I hear no music. I recommend his work with Gong and Bruford. Those albums contain good ""songs"". I also feel compelled to remark on another review. Steve Morse often employs pinch harmonics, I don't know if that what was meant by false. Morse hardly uses any effects. Holdsworth is drowning in effects. Neither is good or bad, just noting the difference. The other reviewer stated otherwise. Joe Satriani hardly ever taps, so that's not where his speed comes from and may use power chords here and there in the background to his songs but that's about it. Back on track, skip this album."
4,great picture. sound is a different story,"Have had this TV almost 2 weeks. The picture is great, do not have the hd cable box hook-up as yet, but picture is still great. Fantastic for movies. The major setback is the sound. Listening to any music channels the bass must be turned off totally. The thumping sound is really bad when music is being played. I hope to get surround sound soon to take care of this problem. Another problem is the remote. Has a slide indicator on the side of the remote to switch to tv, cable, dvd etc....It is pretty hard to pick up the remote without accidentally changing this switch. Should have moved to the front of the remote. All in all pretty satisfied."
2,I'm being kind...,"There are better offerings out there at this price. The animation is decent and the storyline had potential, but it fails to deliver. The lead characters seem to morph personalities during the course of the cartoon (poor writing).In other words, there is a reason why you've never seen this during prime time on network TV..."
4,Good lists,"Great tape with good information. I didn't know about many of the herbs mentioned. They are explained very well, but the tape goes fast. You'll find yourself listening to it a couple of times."
1,LACKS SIGNIFICANT DETAIL TO MAKE ITS CASE,SEEMS TO RAMBLE ABOUT LOOKING FOR AD HOC ARGUMENTS TO REFUTE FRIEDMAN'S WELL DOMONSTRATED IDEAS ON FREE MARKET & CAPITALISM
1,Very Low,I purchased this expensive receiver from Amazon/Etronics in early July and received it with the volume light not working and immediately returned it by UPS. I have not heard one word from Etronics since. It's as if my receiver does not even exist. I have sent a dozen emails but never a reply.
1,Martelli Rotary cutter not what I expected,"While this cutter is comfortable to use I can't seem to keep it straight against the ruler. Let's consider that's operator issues. But then, there is this really thin piece of wire and spring that is supposed to hold the blade cover in place. After just a few cuts, it came off so the blade cover wobbles around and gets in my way. I don't recommend this rotary cutter at all. I went back to my standard Olfa rotary cutter which I love. I really don't know why I thought it would be a good idea to try something else."
4,Joie de vivre (Joy of living),The joy of living is what I am getting in my first read through this book. The first couple of chapters were a bit chewy but the going got rapidly easier! The mix of faith and cooking is well done as are the anecdotes along the way. I have traditionally left the culinary arts to my wife but this is tempting me into the kitchen! Husbands Beware!!
3,Bigger Than Expected,"The quality is top notch. This metal adapter has an un-necessarily large thumbwheel. When used with my Bushnell Ultra HD 8x42 binos, the thumbwheel slightly makes contact with prism barrel housings. Make sure you measure the area near your attachment point to make sure this device will fit. It works fine for me, but someone with a narrower eye profile would be disappointed when used with my binos."
4,"Good Book, Cheap Paper","As with previous installments in this series, the book is very informative and amusingly written. People should know, though, that the nice coated stock (ie, glossy paper) of the previous ""full color"" edition has been replaced by cheaper, uncoated paper. As a result the photographs are grainier, duller, and less sharp; there is more ""bleed-through"" of text from the next page; and the overall look is significantly less bright. I'm sure somebody saved a bundle because of this, but you're paying 5 bucks more for this dubious privilege."
2,NOT Worth it,"The main thing that bothered me about this book was the complete disregard for the original story. First of all, as another reviewer mentioned, the ages of Lydia and Jane's children don't match with when they were married. Another thing is that she has Darcy and Elizabeth discuss how he scorned her and said she was ""fairly tolerable but not enough to tempt me"" while at the Netherfield Ball. Anyone who know P&P at all knows this happened at the Meryton Assembly dance. Not to mention I can not believe sassy Lizzy would become like her mother and so weak or that Darcy and Georgianna would be so mean and cold. If you love P&P don't waste your time, money, or happy thoughts of Darcy and Elizabeth on this book"
1,JANE AUSTEN would ROLL OVER IN HER GRAVE,"This book was disgusting! The inacuracies were bad enough, but what Ms. Tennant did to the characters should be considered a literary CRIME. Mr. Darcy changed by the end of P&P and I seriously doubt he would go back. In fact given the comments of the Housekeeper at Pemberly in P&P he came across as more shy than stuck-up. He most certainly would not have had an affair. He thought Wickham was a rake because of his actions. And even more rediculous is Bingley having an illegitimate child? Bingley? Come On! As placid as Jane Bingley came of in P&P I don't think she would just react with such placidness over Bingley's affair. It is wrong to change the characters that much.If you want to read an EXCELLENT sequel to P&P try PRESUMPTION by Julia Barrett. Or I have heard that DESIRE AND DUTY is also good."
1,"Lame, Lazy and Irresponsible Tripe","The characters lose the individuality infused by Jane Austen and become crude carriers of their names. Throughout the book the author lifts whole passages of P&P, sometimes attributing the quotes to wholly inappropriate characters. Emma Tennant has a tin ear for dialog and reduces the dancing wit of Jane Austen to a lumbering slog through an implausible and uninteresting plot. This book was a gift by someone who meant well or I would return it as defective."
1,"""Hated It""","Not worth reading. I'm on page 59 of this 184 page book and it's horrible. I have been forcing myself to read it in hopes that it will get better. But now that I see the other reviews, I can safely say it won't."
1,Dreadful book!,"This book was so awful that I, a book lover, literally threw it into the trash. The author certainly did not portray either the Elizabeth or the Darcy that appear in the novel. Anyone who has read Pride and Prejudice would never believe that Darcy would abandon Elizabeth after an argument where his position was defending Lady Catherine de Bourgh! Or that Elizabeth would lock Darcy out of the bedroom defending her Mother! That is just the worst example from the book. Like Mr. Collins would treat Elizabeth badly and not understand that at some point there would be retribution from Mr. Darcy? That Georgiana would become close to Caroline Bingley and turn on Elizabeth (and therefore her Brother) is so absurd that I am amazed that anyone would publish this utter nonesense. I hope this write up prevents anyone else from wasting their money on this ridiculous book. Had there been a ""no star"" category, that is the one that I would have chosen."
1,I wish I could give this no stars at all!,"Main characters with the names of Elizabeth and Darcy do not Pride and Prejudice make. Emma Tennant proves this admirably. Though she does have names of the characters correct and where they live, she seems to ignore everything else that is written in Pride and Prejudice. The characterizations are an abomination and the plot is ridiculous, melodramatic, implausible, boring... When writing a sequel to a much-loved, much-studied novel, one should actually read the book on which it is based; if Ms. Tennant knows P&P...I must wonder what caused her to hold such a grudge against Jane Austen. If you like P&P, reading this book will only make you miserable. Don't waste your time or money!"
2,it was ok,"I, like many of the other reviewers, am a great fan of pride and prejudice. I have read the book like 5 times and watched the A&E movie at least 10 times. I adore the characters, plot, the whole novel. I read this book and well the I did noticed inconsistencies and the flaws. I was upset that she killed off Mr. Bennet, from whom it was obvisious where Lizzy got her wit. Yet, I did have a hard time putting it down. It does not do JA's characters justice. However, as a stand alone book it is not ""god awful"", it has its good points. However, by no means will it ever do pride and prejudice justice as a sequel."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read,"This is the definitely the worst book I have ever read - and I am a voracious reader.The plot didn't make sense, the writing was bad, and worst of all, it had none of the style and vivacity of Jane Austen. Although it claims to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice, the characters have little in commmon with those of JA's work except name and they act in such a manner that JA wouldn't even recognise them (and neither will you).In fact, this book was so bad that it made me think that it is obviously not as hard to get published as an author as I thought and I am strongly tempted to rewrite it myself!Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss."
2,Robin Williams Inside The Actor's Studio,"I Agree, would have ordered this,but at only 50 minutes long there is a lot missing-I understand the interview actually lasted 4 hours long and thay edited down to 2 hours for Bravo."
4,Is this a trilogy?,"I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't quite as well written as the first - ""The Wild Road"". Reading only short amounts on a daily basis, it was sometimes difficult to follow the many story threads. It was fun to remember places in New Orleans as Sealink visited them. The author(s) were clever in reintroducing some characters from the first book. I think Tag could have (or should have) played a larger part in this book and did not need to seem so bewildered through out it. It seems there could be a third book coming."
4,Good read,"This is the second installment in a pair of books by Gabriel King. (Gabriel King is actually two authors working together.) The first is THE WILD ROAD. The genre is Fantasy of the Watership Down type. The characters/animals are so well written and compelling that the reader willingly suspends disbelief. I have to say that I enjoyed THE WILD ROAD a little more than I did THE GOLDEN CAT and I can't exactly say why.But for anyone interested in the struggle between good and evil, the haves and have-nots, and just a plain good adventure story - both books are well worth the read. The main characters are cats - and as a cat lover, the behavior of the animals was wonderfully written."

5,I could watch these all day,I enjoy that Les is a rugged outdoorsman without the hyper macho garbage you get from that bear grylls guy
5,Great Survivorman DVD,"I chose this rating for customer service, the quality of the DVD when it arrived and how quickly I received my order. I recommend this company and I will use it again in the future."
3,Purchased for family,I was asked to buy these for other family members. I am not a survivor man fan. I guess these are entertaining if you are a fan
5,The Stuff of Nightmares,"I still have nightmares after reading this book. I go to Alaska every couple of years, and you better believe I never go anywhere unarmed while I'm in bear country. This book will make you understand why."
2,Worst McBain book...ever,It was a struggle for me to finish Snow White Rose Red. I only persisted because of the many hours of reading pleasure I have had from previous McBain books.
4,Hal's Memory Card Reader,"This card reader gets the job done well. I wish the cap fit better and that it had a key chain provision as part of the design. Also, it is a bit awkward to insert the SD card. All in all, an OK product. Fast service from this vendor."
4,Okay - cheap build though - careful how you handle it,This thing works as expected. However it is very cheaply made and the mid section is very flimsy. Not sure how it will stand up to lots of use.
5,Sandisk MobileMate SD Plus Memory Card Reader,Other less expensive units failed after 6+ months of use. Hope this product holds up much better.
5,"Exactly what I needed, works great!","I bought this SD reader a couple years ago, along with a SD card for backing up my Nintendo Wii saves. It has been such an amazing tool, that I've ended up using it long term for other purposes other than originally intended.I love the fact that I can use it for Micro, Mini, and Standard cards. I originally was using it for a standard, but lately found myself using it for smaller cards. This made it convenient for myself as I didn't need to buy a second card reader.It is small, and portable. It also has a nice little cap for protection.In all I found it to be affordable, and a great SD Reader that will last years down the road. It is so convenient, that I've had people ask me to borrow it. I wouldn't buy any other reader."
5,One of my favorites!!!,"I popped this in my player when this first came out, and it still gets much play!!! This artist has a strong voice. Where is she now? Hold On is my jam!!! When I'm going through something deep, I play this song. Symptoms of a Heartbreak is a song I played after breaking up with someone. This album was slept on IMHO."
2,He is the worst director in the world,The art cover for this movie is a decemptive there is'nt so cute girl killing people with a knife. Also the movie very boring
1,Slip into something very dark and very nasty.,"I have gotten to an age where I don't want to watch horror movies in general. I make exceptions where Michael Pare` is concerned. BUT... whit this movie - I see no reason for its existence. If your into vile and disgusting and lots of blood, then this is for you. Uwe Boll can be so far out that if, as I said, it were not for liking Pare`, I would stay away from most of his movies. So to finish up, most of you should stay away from this particular movie.Foxy Loxy"
2,Lacking any Real Instruction or Guidance,"Writing Humor is a guide for those seeking to implement humor into their writing. Ian Bernard uses examples from several genres to illustrate the use of humor and the style of techniques used to illicit comedic reactions.Although the examples are abundant and comprehensive, I was disappointed to discover how little instruction the book contained. Detailing types of humor is useful only to the extent that one might be able to recognize forms of humor in writing, but to produce humor something significantly more is required. I recommend to any writer seeking ways to add humor into their writing to look elsewhere."
2,Not a How-To,"I didn't laugh until I reached the top of page 123. I don't know whether that says more about my sense of humor, or about the author's.On the one hand, I can't recommend this book, because it's VERY light on the ""how to"", and VERY heavy on the quotes and examples. On the other hand, reading this book has convinced me I'd like to try my hand at writing things that make people laugh.This book is mostly harmless - that is, I don't expect it would cause you to become a worse writer. My suggestion: borrow this book from the library, read it, and see if you get more out of it than I did."
5,Learning about Panic Attacks,"This book is well organized and easy to use as a reference. Each chapter has a different author.The topics are varied and well presented. The text is easy to read. The chapters on the body approaches to working with panic were the most interesting for me. I also would point out that after some chapters a listing called ""end notes"" is included whch provides the reader with sources of further information, and in a few instances a way to contact the author of a given article."
4,works after fixing it,"Found this for 9.99. Also experienced the static and interference. I undone the 3 screws on the back of the receiver and found the squelch control inside. A quarter turn clockwise and no more static or interference just good clean signal and clear sound. A shame you have to do this to get it to work, but still way less than the sony voice activated"
4,Bodhran,"This item is good quality, shipped fairly fast and works for the purpose I purchased it. My only complaint is that it isn't the identical item in the photo. I'm sure it won't affect it's performance, but it doesn't have the decorative binding around the edge of the drum surface as pictured. Not a deal breaker, however, I like to receive the same item represented when I purchase online."
4,"great movie, fast service",I was very glad to be able to find this little known movie. Prompt delivery by seller.
3,Good visit to Australia,Good flick. Eric Roberts played a believable yet naive character. Some good music too.
1,Creepy and stupid.,"The pictures are just plain creepy. Why does anyone publish this kind of stuff? Nothing interesting at all here ... except those freaky pictures, which I prefer to live without. Brrrrr."
5,Cute book,"I bought this book for my 2 year old daughter hesitant at first that she was too old for it. When we got it she fell in love with it. She knew who David was from previous books we've read about him. This book is really well written and has great illustrations to help a young child understand their five senses. After just reading it a few times with her she now opens it up and points to her body parts as she sees them in the picture. For example when they show taste they show a sucker with bugs and trash stuck to it. And she'll say ""Ew! Don't eat David"". It gives room to discuss things a child should and should not do."
1,Seriously people???,David looks like death warmed over. He is seriously creepy looking and the rest of the art is terrible. 4th graders have more artistic talent. Nightmare quality artwork right here!But what really bothers me is the theme of this book is intentionally negative. David is constantly getting in trouble and being yelled at.I don't know how this book ended up in our collection but I threw it in the trash! It's FAR to creepy to donate!!!
4,here to stay,"when you talk about rock and roll ike should be considered the man who started it all, its hard to believe that rcket 88 is over fifty years old. cd shows ike talents from singing ro piano to guitar."
4,THE INNOVATOR,"Ike Turner shows that many people slept on him. Here is a musician who knows his craft and he knows how to sell a song. I've been a fan from the beginning. Wish someone would find his album ""Blues Roots"" then my Ike Turner collection will be complete. Going Home Tomorrow."
3,Old Classic On Streaming,"This is the classic documentary from the ""life-on-other-planets"" genre. Narrated by legendary Rod Serling, this one also speculates that life on earth came from the stars. The transfer from tape is not that great and this one has certainly aged. However, Serling's voice and some interesting film clips of international locations provides some decent entertainment."
5,a book of substance and beauty,"Ana Imagined is a riveting and satisfying read with something important to say. The language is spare and beautiful. The characters are fully-drawn and engaging, with the narrative moving seamlessly between the lives of two women whose daily lives are very different but who have so much in common. This is the kind of book you can't put down, but you don't want to be over. I want to hand this book to everyone I know and tell them, ""Read this--you'll love it!"""
5,Delicious!,"We have tasted many different kinds of rice, and this is our favorite. The flavor is wonderful, and the rice can be used in any rice dish. Brown rice is more nutritious than white rice, and for that reason we choose to eat this exclusively at home. We highly recommend your trying it if you haven't already. You may find it will be your favorite too."
1,Fear Mongering BS,"I thought this show was okay until I saw the episode about DaVinci. It was pretty obvious that the three investigators looked at all the facts and then simply made up their own fabricated story about what kind of message DaVinci was trying to send to the world. The dramatic narrative was created from nothing, and it was a cheap and cliche narrative at that. Plus, if I see another scene with those three driving around in their Lincoln SUV -- a blatant and shamelessly staged product placement -- or with mouths agape in posed dramatic shock while interviewing an expert, I will probably vomit on my cable box."
4,Just the intermission I've been looking for.,"Well, I picked this album up expecting a hard industrial sound and well, let's just say it's not. It's closer to a soft version of Filter than NIN. The lyrics are incredibly good (well, maybe not on 'wasted') but overall it's a soft intermission to some of the harder stuff I listen to. Overall, I like it. If you like a mellow rock experience than I suggest you pick this one up."
3,Bryan Adams on acid...?,"I must admit, when I first heard that Stabbing Westward was splitting, I was crushed. I always thought Stabbing Westward to be one of the most unrecognized bands of today's 'industrial' based music scene. However...I was a little disappointed with this final collection. It was a little soft in face of their former pieces, and frankly, this self-titled compilation doesn't hold a candle to the inferno that Wither, Blister, Burn + Peel is. So Far Away sets the stage for what could have been an excellent album, but I was convinced that Stabbing Westward had gone bubblegum when Perfect began to play. Other noteworthy songs would have to be Wasted, Happy, and High, but this album would have been better without the rest. If you're looking for Stabbing Westward's best, I recommend the previously noted Wither, Blister, Burn + Peel and/or Darkest Days."
2,Drawn cause of one song,"The first time I ever heard a SW song was on the radio and the song was So Far Away. I really liked the song so much that I bought the album. The album isn't all that good. I also heard their other albums which don't even sound anything like this one. They all have a industrial rock style as opposed to an alternative style which they present in this album. The singer even sounds different in other albums such as their debut album UNGOD in which the singer has a very industrial hard rock voice. I enjoyed their debut album UNGOD much more then this one. So by all means buy their first album if you want to hear SW in all their industrial goth rock glory, the only reason I recommend this album at all is because of the first track So Far Away it was the first song I heard and after hearing every single Stabbing Westward song and I mean every single Stabbing Westward song So Far Away is my favorite. So either buy the single or download it."
4,stabbing eastwward,"i really love every song on this new cd by stabbing westward,the songs are less aggressive then the previous three cds but the songs are more melodic then aggressive."
4,The new image,"I thought that the CD was pretty cool. The songs aren't as hard as previous albums so i was surprized. However, the CD ws still cool and am glad i bought it. Their new image has taken an interesting turn but see for yourself. A bit of warning if you do; most of the songs on this album are very similar so don't listen to this CD on long trips. These are my words of wisdom!"
4,Touching,"This book was penetrating and witty, giving a portrait of pre-war Vitebsk that makes the reader feel transported back to that time and location. Sweet without being cloying, the memoir bursts from the pages as if Bella were in front of you, holding a conversation with you."
4,"The ""Legend"" of Poco","Okay, first the problem with this release, it's only 2hrs 20mins when 2 discs discs nowdays can run 2hrs 40mins. All the cd's that I'm familiar with in the Gold series have this problem. In the words, there's room for about 4 to 6 additional songs on this compilation. Only two Richie songs show up here and it is missing songs from a couple of key albums. Hint, hint hint. Had they used the extra room to fill in these spots, this would probably be the best career anthology released on this band. However, due to this fact it gets knocked down from a 5 to a 4 star release."
2,Great for an hour or two.,"Bought these two months ago thinking they would be the perfect addition to my outdoor home theater set up. Well they were for about an hour and a half and then blam without warning the right speaker blows. I was running them on a receiver with a measley 400 watt output and was only on about 4 on the master volume. Maybe I got a bad driver,maybe not. Either way the only positive things i can say is that they sounded great while they worked and that Amazon made it very easy to return them. Already replaced with Bose 151's now those are some great sounding speakers."
3,Caution - Grills Will Rust,"Bought these speakers in 2009 for my runabout boat, drove them with a 70 watt per channel amplifier. They handled the power with decent sound for the price but not great overall, somewhat boomy in the upper bass range and harsh highs. As other said mounting brackets are flimsy but I was able to make them work. After two summers of use on the boat, I used them since the fall of 2010 for music by our hot tub. I mounted the speakers under a bay window overhang so as not to be in direct rain/snow. This year I noticed that the painted grills and brackets are starting to rust through, making the speakers look shabby. They still work but I'm leaving them for the hot tub. Based on reviews I ordered a pair of Polk 4's from Amazon. They're about double the price but I wanted better sound and more rugged, corrosion proof speakers (Polks use no painted steel components). We'll see how they work."
1,Crapola,Most disappointedThe guy has no idea and is definitely not connected to the Divine Mother in these conversations
3,My hands are clean now.,"I love this brush. It helps my hand washing to be really clean. I always wash my hands when I put on and take off my contact lenses, but I sometimes get eye infection. This brush really make sure that my hands are really clean. The bristle feel nice on the hands and does its job."
5,Just Buy It!,"Price is right. Quality is good. Works well.I liked the product well enough that I keep one in each bathroom, one in my shaving kit and have a spare."
5,Nail Brush,What a great brush! Two sided and can really take a rough life either in the shower or by the sink. Easy to clean and looks nice in the bathroom. A great buy.
2,You get what you pay for.,"This item was not very expensive and serves its purpose, but I am disappointed that after only a few weeks there are already signs of rust around the bristles. I will need to replace this with something else."
5,Romantic movie,The movie is a romantic saga about two people who can never be together because they live in two different worlds.
5,Beauty and the Beast,This is a fantastic series. Ron Perlman had me from the very first episode. This beautiful Beast was what every woman dreams of. It was canceled really before it had a good chance to find its niche. More fool CBS
3,A bit disappointed...,I found the bands to be very awkward in many of the exercises (it's not the first time I've used them and I was still focusing on their position more than on my legs) and the entire video just didn't leave me feeling like I had just worked out my lower body for 45 minutes. I think Billy's Amped Rockin' Buns was a much better workout (my legs still felt it 3 days later -- without the amplifier) and would recommend it to anyone who thought this video needed a little more burn.
1,Wrong size in description,"These # 10, 0.125 x 1.25 inch rubber bands are actually 1/16 in. wide, not 1/8 in. as described. The description on the box is correct, but the listing should read #10, 0.0625 x 1.25 inches.There is nothing wrong with the bands themselves."
5,"Witty, wise and Wonderful!","This is such a wonderful book. Quirky, unique, moving, and VERY funny. I have re-read it many times. Barbara Wersba's writing style is so wonderfully funny. Can't recommend this book highly enough. , it is listed incorrectly on this site as being for baby-preschool. It is a YA fiction book, actually."
5,Excellent book for understanding programming COM with VB,This book gives an insight on COM from VB perspective. Programmers working on VB should read this book for better understanding of COM. I searched for COM books but could not find one except this one which explains it for VB.
3,Theory over substance,"It appears the author has spent much of his recent time on the road teaching instead of coding. If you want to sit around with your fellow programmers and discuss the esoterica then this is the book for you. However, if you want to learn COM then I would look elsewhere."
5,This book truly explains special relativity.,"This is a college text to teach special relativity at an introductory level. It has been worked and reworked. The topic is drilled and redrilled in an accessible and complete manner. If you're frustrated by the flip summaries, and really want to understand topics like the twin paradox, this is the book! The math is presented but is not the language of the book. The coverage includes ALL of the areas where special relativity applies, many in exercises and special ""boxes"". You can go as far as you like. You will never again wonder what special relativity means, or doubt the consequences of the theory!"
3,Not for everyone,"I found the narrative style to be more confusing than clarifying. Also, some of the exercises were very difficult to work out and the text was not helpful as a resource.This book should <font size=""+3"" color=""red"">not</font> be purchased unless you are taking a course in SR. It purports to be written for the non-physicist, but I can't imagine my mother understanding it at all, regarless of her level of interest. If you are taking a course, the paradoxes are challenging and interesting."
2,terrible,"I don't understand why anyone would want to use this book to study SR. It is ridiculously long winded -wasting pages to describe a paradox in elaborate detail. You're probably thinking ""oh good, a physics book that's not dry""... before you take the advice of a positive reviewer, check it out from the library and see what I mean. It is so convoluted with silly detail that it's almost unreadable. If you're a high school student interested in grasping a piece of SR then MAYBE this could be of use. If you're a physics student who wants to learn something at a reasonable pace, look elsewhere."
2,"occasionally interesting, but poorly written and dumbed-down","I had to read this book for the first part of Phys 1b, as did the other reader below. It goes into more depth about the paradoxes, etc., than most books for the general audience, but the book is also dumbed down, includes strange and confusing metaphors, and says in 10 or 20 pages what could have been said in a paragraph. I have less Physics background than most other people in my class, so some of the material was new and interesting, but even so, the book was poorly written and rather condescending. That damn, smug b---d of a talking bird!"
2,not great wilbur smith,"im an avid wilbur smith fan and i have read all his books, starting ten years ago. due to lack of availability, i have had to acquire many of them out of country, including canada, britain, the far east, and south africa, where i started reading them. it seems like wilbur only became popular in the US with river god. I consider a sparrow falls to be his weakest book. after reading a number of books on south african history, fictionalized or not, i find a sparrow falls to be much fiction, little history, as opposed to lion feeds and sound of thunder. its like this story was made only to finish off the series and tie up the loose ends. my favorite of his novels were the next five courtneys and elephant song. of course, anyone interested in the fictionalized history of southern africa, the worlds most fascinating, also has to read the covenant. try robert ruark as well for eastern africa."
4,One Good Book about Forgiving,I like most of the characters in this book except Rick he was too creepy and cold. Bobby was not equal to Lacey. Wish Ms. Diane would of made Lacey's love interests more likable. The relationship between the little girl and Lacey was awesome and it real hit home that they needed each other. This book needs to be read to the very end. Just wish she would of written more of where they lived. You didn't get a real sense of it. I like the forgiveness in this book it was written very well. Had tears in my eyes at the end.
5,superp,"A courageous book which dares to ask why white males would wish to keep the racial divide as large as it is. It seems that while white women, who have also suffered at the hands of white male bigots, are better able to empathize with African-Americans. but that is no surprise. What is a surprise is how brave, insightful and intelligent this book is."
3,More of the same? Almost.,"Bjornstad has three other CDs in this series, The Sea, The Sea II and The River. Each would stand alone as tranquil, pensive music from fine musicians (particularly David Darling). Taken together they are too too much the same. Water Stories stands out a bit from the others, has more variation, more interest and maybe even a surprise or two (you may never stay awake through all of The Sea I & II). Terje Rypdal provides, for me at least, the only relief in this vast and rather blank seascape."
5,duster,"Duster: Garden Hand Held DesignDoes a great job spreading insecticide, etc evenly and forceably. Reaches top or bottem of plants."
1,noth worth the price,"I purchased this to do my fruit trees at my farm house in the adrondaks when i got up here this weekend i opened it up and attached the handle all went together easy i then opened the 50 lbs of de and put 2 cup full's in the hopper. I went out to the orchard and started cranking the first few winds worked and after that nothing,I then shook it and cranked again same thing it worked for the first few cranks then nothing i repeted this for 20 min and got tired of it and did my trees by hand, in less time. This is Junk do not buy it. I could not return because i am 2 days past the return date as i just got to try it."
3,"Great idea, not so great writing","The author had a great idea in taking a closer look at the personal stories of side show performers; however, the text itself reads like a badly written Freshman Comp. paper. Redundancies and awkward phrases abound. This book would have been greatly improved by additional editing before publication. I found the subject matter interesting but the text irksome."
5,FAST SHIPPING,Very great customer service and super fast shipping. It was supposed to be a 2 day shipping and it arrived the next day at 9AM. Amazon is great! This book I am currently using it and the price is much better than it is at my book store. I paid a great price for a brand new book and it would have been the same for a used book at my bookstore.
2,Too much hassle.,"The color applicator dint quite work the way it should. The dye flowed out more freely than I would have liked it to, resulting in color dripping all over the place. It got so messy that I stopped and did the rest of my hair with a brush the conventional way. The reason for two stars is because the product looks exactly like in the picture and secondly for the benefit of doubt that perhaps I might not have know how to use it properly. Either way I did not like the product and will not be buying anymore of these."
3,"3500, 3600, 3700d whatever","This system sounded great the first week and today the rear left surround speaker sounds weak. My system is the 3700d, but they're all the same except for sub wattage. I can't hear the sounds or music from my Lord of the Rings DVD except through the right surround. This really bothers me. My right ear is ringing because thier is no sound on the left. Star Trek The Motion picture also has problems in the rear left which means the system will be going back to the store I bought it. Philips makes great TV's, but thier VCRs and DVD systems are mediocre."
1,Very Disappointed,"Bought it as a spare/cheap system for a guess room. Tested two-out-of-two DVD movies, noticed about 6 to 10 GLITCHES of white spots and lines. Tested CD-RW discs, noticed a loud pop at the beginning of almost every song. ""You get what you pay for"", my husband and I agreed. Oh, when we went to return it, an employee at the store stated that he has the same system and did noticed the glitches as well, but didn't mind it... Whatever!!! I don't recommend this system, it was our first Philips brand, and now have doubts in all Phillip products as well, for putting out such a defected model. For those that own one, if you noticed the problems described, please validate our findings, to inform others."
4,MX3950,I actually own the MX3950 model. (It holds 5 discs). I have not experienced any glitches when watching my DVDs. As for the weird message someone says appears on your screen after watching a movie that's longer than an hour...never happened to me.I love the sound on the system...I truly feel like I'm at the movies...you can hear the sound outside!The only thing I don't like about the system is you can not have your own background...you have to keep the standard Phillips DVD screen when there are no discs loaded or you're listening to CD's. I had a Samsung player that would let you load your own photos as the background. But that's minor.I really do enjoy the system and would recommend it to others. If you have a SAMS card you can get my model for the same price Target is selling theirs.
3,Historical but not very entertaining,"I suppose the facts are good, but whew, the story telling was awful! I'm surprised that it was passed by an editor. It was interesting, but I felt that I was reading stories aimed at a child as the story telling was so poor.But it wasn't a horrible book, just not my favorite."
1,Buy Hallmark,If your purpose is to print greeting cards don't buy this. The selection is slim to none. Waste of money!!!!
3,OK feeder,"When I first got this feeder my cat would sit on it waiting for her next meal. Her weight stopped the mechanism in the center from turning and therefore stopped her from getting her food. I had to push the dish against the wall and place a box on top so she couldn't sit on top of the feeder. This has worked so far, until she figures out how to move the box. Another drawback is that it really only holds 4 meals since 1 slot is already open. So if I'm gone longer than 2 days I need to find someone to come over and feed my cat."
5,feeds my cat 5 times a day,"Great product! So easy to use. It has five spaces for food, which is perfect for my cat. He throws up his food because he eats it all at once, so I had to start feeding him only a little bit at different times. It was hard to do that since my daily schedule changes a lot. This feeder is perfect because I load it once a day and he's always fed every six hours (that leaves one empty slot of food, which is usually the current one when I load the other four).Requires batteries, size D, and that's fine. As soon as I loaded them, the feeder turned on. Instructions made it clear how to load the feed times.My cat hasn't tampered with the product at all (yet). I know another reviewer said his cat just pushed the servings to get to all five slots. My cat is not that smart. But he is that hungry! My gosh, he still thinks that my only role is to feed him...."
2,To bulky and not easy to use,I found this product too bulky and not easy to use for a daily basis. I sent it back and not recommended because I found it too bulky and difficult to set.
1,BEWARE!!! If you love your pet DON'T buy this,"Despite some of the negative reviews, I purchased this item anyway because there were far more positive reviews. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! We went away this past weekend where on Friday I set up the timers to open on 2 separate occasions during our absence. We returned Sunday morning to see that they never opened. My poor cat is 8 and a half years old and he went without food for 48 hours!!!! We feel so terrible and guilty. I'm returning this piece of &#$*$*#"
2,wont work for smart animals!,"It is a high quality item - probably the highest of all that I have seen. However, this will not work for smart dogs or cats!Granted the dog probably wont be able to open the lid, but they don't have to. The tray on the inside does not lock into position. It only takes a small amount of pressure to push on the side of the food compartment and make it rotate over to the next one! My Australian Shepherd had this figured out in a matter of days, and even my coating the open compartment in apple bitter spray did not stop him.This thing is useless if you have a smart animal.It is now completely useless to me. I'm going to purchase one of the autofeeders with the reservoir bin that drops food into a bowl, cut the bottom out of the bowl, and mount the thing HIGH on the wall where my dog cannot reach it. It'll drop the food onto the floor and he can have a blast cleaning it up. I think this is the only way I'm going to be able to get any of these things to work with him."
5,Great product,"After taking out batteries and reinstalling, the feeder now looks like it works. At first the manual advance button would not work, maybe the batteries were skewed. The feeder rotated on time and it looks like it's going to work for the weekend. Glad I bought it."
1,"Had a lot of hope, unfortunately didn't work - at all","Was really looking forward to this automatic pet feeder being able to help out with one of my dogs-who has to eat every few hours due to stomach issues. I ordered two (one for each dog) and unfortunately, in both, the food compartments did not fully advance when they were supposed to. Really frustrating, as they would ""manually advance"" but not on the automatic settings. One of the feeders would keep trying (with a most irritating noise attached to those attempts) for a while, the other just was happy to move forward 1/2 a compartment at a time.Needless to say, that didn't quite work for my needs, so I will be returning these to Amazon for a refund. I'll have to try some of the other options on Amazon and hope for better luck."
4,MEAL FEEDER,"This is the second one I have bought over the years. My last one lasted about 5 years and then the lid spring broke. It's great and I recommend it to all my cat owner friends and family.Great price, retail stores cost double the amount.Chicago, IL"
1,Not durable.. returned it.,"I liked the premise of the item and it was highly reviewed so I decided to order it. It was easy enough to set up, although it is stupid the instructions are glued inside the lid. What's wrong with the good ol' fashioned booklet? I set it up and my dog understood what was up and then I went to work. I came home and it was in the middle of the dining room and you could see where she had scratched at it and tried to chew away the plastic. It didn't look like she managed to get the food because there was only one empty container showing. Well, I opened it up and I had filled the carousel and it was completely empty. My dog is not that wild either, never has really destroyed anything of value. So, to sum it up, she was able to tip it over or shake it out or something and it wasn't durable or tip-proof as described so I returned it."
2,My cat learned how to break it open after 2 weeks,"At first, I thought this feeder did the job and I didn't have to get up at 4am to give the cat food when he pestered me. After a few weeks of using the feeder, my cat discovered how to jam his paw under the cover and pop open the lids. My cat is small but it is fairly easy for him to help himself. My dog also can get it open by force. This feeder is a great idea but is just not rugged enough to work for food driven animals like my cat. If it came in stainless steel and the covers came down further so as not to leave a gap this would be better."
3,works okay but had to make some adjustments,"My cat started waking me up at 5am wanting to be fed. So, in order to save my cat from myself something had to be done! I read the negative reviews but figured it was worth a shot. Sure enough, after a couple of days she figured out how to push the feeder forward to get the rest of the food. My solution, I put her evening meal in the already exposed hopper, I put her morning meal three hoppers back and then schedule the hopper to move forward 3 times come morning feeding time. My cat doesn't try to move the hopper forward and it solves the problem of my cat getting her 5am feeding and not waking me up."
3,LOVE it... but our dog is a clever piggy.,"While I know this product is not meant to replace the personal care we should all give our pets, it IS handy to have around when I can't get home to feed our Boston Terrier (Pete) his lunch. Relying on a machine to do the job for me produces less guilt than missing a feeding entirely! We've had our unit for about 6 months now... and are no longer using it like we were when we first received it. By about month 3, Pete learned that he could shove his flat little face into the food bowl/compartment and PUSH it until the next compartment (and next meal) was exposed. This happened intermittently for a few more months... until recently when he REALLY started getting the hang of it. Now, he will clear the entire round of feedings (5 compartments) by the time I come home from work at 3:00. Just because he can. GREAT while it lasted. I think it would work well for cats though... not as much strength for pushing as a dog."
2,Two stars cuz it worked for two days.,"Ok, I would have given this one star if it one star if it weren't so funny watching the cats systematically tear this device a part. I would wake up in the morning olny to find no food and bent open. This did not work"
5,Now I have one happy puppy at home!!,"I bought this for my yorkiepoo puppy over a month ago. We needed to feed her 3 times a day both my wife and I work full time and we didn't have our daughter rushing home everyday after school to feed her. It's easy to set up, works great, and it looks very sturdy. Also, because of its design you won't have to worry about it getting jam or malfunctioning. Yes, it is rather loud when it rotates and our puppy did shy away from it at first, but if you feed your puppy a couple of times from it (before programming it), it should make it easier for him/her. Now we don't have to rush home every day to feed her and we can leave her alone when we need to go out without having to rush or worry because it's past her meal time. Plus, it was way less than anything available at the pet store."
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","Looks like it's straight from a used VHS tape. You need to zoom in 2x to get it to fill the screen. Too bad, I was really looking forward to seeing this again. Not worth the $9. price tag. Wait for a better DVD."
5,Beautiful,"I love the designs, and recommend tracing with a knitting needle with dressmaker's carbon if you want to use the designs more than once."
5,"Country/Country Rock? Who Cares, it's just good!",True artists like this are hard to find. I'm not gonna do a track by track. There's enough of that goin' on. This is fine stuff no matter when it was made. Some people just have so much to say and then leave. He did and he did. Great tortured artist. Get it and feel it.
1,REVIEW ON GARY STEWART-OUT OF HAND CD,"I HAVE NOT RECIEVED MY ORDER FROM AMAZON.COM FOR OUT OF HAND/YOUR PLACE OR MINE CD. THE ORDER WAS PLACED ON 3/19/10. TODAY IS APRIL 22, 2010. SO IT IS HARD TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE!!"
4,Essential for the Star Wars fan,"This book covers many aspects of the filming, and as Arnold has covered decades of movie making before writing this book, he is obviously genuinely impressed with the scale of the production. Good interviews with important members of the cast and crew; even includes Sir Alec Guiness. Especially illuminating chats with Lucas about the overall nine part structure of Star Wars. It's interesting to compare Lucas' initial ideas about the sequels and prequels with what was finally released. The highlight of the book is a transciption of a day spent following Irwin Kershner filming on the carbon freezing chamber set (Secrets revealed include the fact that Jeremy Bulloch as Boba Fett was actually desperate to use the lavatory throughout the whole day's shoot). As a collector of Star Wars related books, I have amassed over a hundred, but this remains my favourite."
4,See it un-dubbed!,"Reviewer No. 1 is a bit tough I think. This is a hilarious movie well worth the money! BUT, I'm sure that the dubbed version (with English subtitles) is superior because you get more of the ""atmosphere"" that the actors try and create. Give it a go!"
2,Ridiculous,Apparently the author hopes to create some excitement by turning Ms Austen into a cross between Nancy Drew and Forrest Gump. Just doesn't work. She should go back to writing contemporary murder mysteries under the name Francine Matthews. She did that much better.
5,I'd give it 6 stars if I could,"Barron is amazingly thrilling in this the 7th book in the Jane Austen Mystery series. Throughout the series we've gained glimpses of Jane's life and how dull it is without a mystery to solve and without a certain Gentleman Rouge to liven things up.This book was wonderful, containing delightful dialogue between Jane and her Rouge, interesting characters in Orlando, Sophia Challoner, Mr. Ord, the man in black and ties to reality in Mrs. Fitzherbert. Set against the background of the mysterious Netley Abbey, calling to mind Austen's Northanger Abbey, along with the tensions of stopping further mischief from occurring that would injure the Crown's attempts to keep the Monster in check. Tightly wound from beginning until the end, this one is one of the best in the series."
4,Good Deal,"Both table and stool works good for what I need for, but the foot rest on the stool in not sturdy."
5,Outstanding love story..,"One thing I found out about Lisa Kleypas books is if you dont like one just wait, because you will find one that you like. I loved this story. Logan was a great hero who had a tortured past, and made something of himself. Maddy is a great heroine who has a backbone, and stands up for herself, but she also has vulnerability which makes her likable. What I liked about this book, is that Logan was not a lord, he was an actor. The only thing that I would have liked to see is the realtionship with Logan's father being dicussed more, but even that wasn't enough to damper this book. There love story is amazing, and I am so glad I found this book."
4,So Lisa Kleypas,This lovely story is typical Kleypas.. The haunted hero and the driven heroine paired under unusual circumstances..Mismatched but drawn to each other as the heroine seeks refuge in the theater.
5,"Great, great read","WARNING: THIS BOOK IS ADDICTIVE!Me and my friends all found that starting this book is addictive. You start reading and you can't put it down for anything. You can spend an entire day without even realizing it.Jenna Rose kinda flows through life, getting whatever she wants without much effort. Then she moves and is faced with who she really is! Can she let the people who want to get to know her see who she really is-- and then will they still want to be around her? Or should she compromise who she wants to be just to get in with the crowd that she wants to be in?Awesome start to what's going to be a great series!"
4,Good Reader,"I bought this as part of the curriculum that we are following, via The Well Trained Mind. It is good, but I'm annoyed by the outdated grammar. There is spacing within the contractions like ""is n't"" and is missing other appropriate punctuation. I'm also not a big fan of each sentence being separated and numbered like a list, rather than in paragraphs. But the merits of the reader outweigh the negatives and I've not sought out another reader. I think it's just time for another revised edition."
2,boring..,"Got this when i bought ace combat 6 game for my xbox 360.. I thought it'd be cool, but it was actually pretty lame. At least it was a documentary, and therefore a true story.. Honestly, that (and it being free) was the only reason I saw it to the end."
2,seams like poor construction,After having read the reviews I thought I would try my luck with this tent. I loved the space and ease of setup. I took the tent home and immediately set it up in the backyard. The next afternoon we took it down and set it up at the campsite. After a few hours I noticed the tent was pulling apart at the seam joining the floor and side. Fortunately it did not rain and was too windy for mosquitoes. I returned the tent and chose not to purchase another.
4,A TASTY TREAT FROM FATTBURGER,"Although on the lean side time wise (only 39mins of music _ c'mon guys, you can serve up more than this per cd) TGIF offers more smooth, slinky grooves. Highlight is Fattburger's cover of the Santana classic, Evil Ways, which is complete with wicked guitar licks that would do Carlos proud. This track has been begging for a rework and Fattburger pull out all stops to get it funky. Another standout is Take Six, a beautiful free flowing piece with sensual alto sax work throughout. Fattburger have what it takes but need too unleash more of themselves on future releases. How about 60mins per cd?"
4,Wailers at castle 60s again,Excellent 60s stuff. anyone from that era in the Pacific NW would enjoy the memories
1,"Horrible Camera, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!","We are quite unsatisfied with this camera's performance. It runs on 2 double A batteries and so therefore dies after about 8-15 minutes or so on new batteries. This includes playback, where the batteries seem to die even quicker. Installation of software for playback on a PC or playback on a TV is difficult, frustrating, and requires a lot of patience. This camera is not good at taking digital still photos (turn out blury, lighting bad indoors), and can only hold a few on the 128 MB card. This card also holds about 15 minutes of video and nothing else. The camera is low quality and the cards are also lacking. Please, Please do not do what we did. We are stuck with this camera because it passed the 90 day return policy. Don't put yourself in that situation, do NOT buy this camera. (How can you use it if it won't run for more than 15 minutes tops!!)"
2,I haven't bought it yet,"I saw this one in the store. It looks good, but I have a limited budget. I just don't know if I should even bother. My family goes on trips every weekend, and it would be nice to catch some of those memories. Maybe there's a better one somewhere?"
4,Not a bad camera for the price...,"If you are looking to not spend a lot of money for an entry-level digital camera, this wouldn't be a bad choice. My mom has this model and I've used it on several occasions without any problems. Much better than the Aiptek DV4500 which is supposed to have more bells & whistles, but just doesn't have the same level of quality as this model."
3,beautiful but the dimensions are misleading,"I bought this for my outdoor garden in NYC. and I am happy with the way how it looks. It really looks like real terra cotta and the embossed decorations on the side were wonderful.However, the dimensions are a little misleading it is less than 13 inches in diameter INSIDE the pot and about 12 inches in height. It doesn't come predrilled as well, if you want a pot that can withstand at least a nyc winter, according to famous times columnist the minimum heieght and diameter should at least be 14""."
3,Kind of a let down,"As a huge fan of ""Mr.Tall Dark and Broody"" I was overjoyed to learn that Joss Whedon wanted to take a more active role in the comic series. The series was amazing - this could only make it better! Right? Apparently not. I love Angel, so the book wasn't a total loss. There were a few laughs, but overall I was confused by the practically non-existent plot and the countless loose ends it left trailing in its wake. In addition the action sequences lacked the requisite frames that would allow readers to follow the fights. Overall, the book was a disappointment. I recommend Joss stick to the small screen and let the old staff get back to producing an extraordinary comic series."
1,High hopes...deflated,"I was really excited about getting this new item. Could hardly wait to start transferring tapes and start recording in a dvd format. I was actually waiting for GoVideo to introduce this product before I would purchase one. I have an ten year old (at least) GoVideo dual deck vcr which has never let me down. Worked great and really simple to use.This new product is a mess. Really bad, complicated design which was surprising.The really bad news is that the machine locks up all the time, and I have to unplug it constantly to unlock it. But why bother...it only does it again a few minutes later.Granted, I have a defective product. Not sure if I am willing to try it again. What happened to that GoVideo quality?"
1,ted weems complete volume 2,"I paid $16.95 for the complete volume, only 10 songs out of 24 were on the CD - I feel cheated!"
3,Sonics will kick your teeth in!,"When the Sonics came roaring out of Tacoma with this 1965 album, the band pulled out all the stops. The Sonics did not care about making pretty love songs or serious artistic statements. They wanted to rock hard and loud and that they did. Lead singer Gerry Roslie screamed his lungs out, drummer Bob Bennett broke his drum pedals, Rob Lind wailed away on his saxophone and the Parypa brothers made sure that the guitar sound was absolutely filthy. The four original tunes on the album are the ones that really shine which are ""The Witch"", ""Boss Hoss"", ""Psycho"" and ""Strychnine"". The covers rock with abandon but simply do not hold up very well which hurts the quality of the album. The CD reissue from Norton contains three tracks from an Etiquette Christmas album from 1965 which are pretty funny. One of them is the ""Too Much Monkey Business"" knockoff ""Don't Believe In Christmas""."
3,"Good, but not great","This would have been more authentically described as a seafood book. And the author redefines Little Italy, so if you were expecting faves from Manhattan's Little Italy, this is not it. Even so it leaves out dishes like linguini and clam sauce, regular old ravioli...you know Little Italy fare. Instead you learn how to cook a whole pigs leg etc... I'm sure these are rare recipes, but probably not what I'd order when going to Little Italy."
2,It's been a short 5 years...,"Made in UK in 1993, Serial# CDGRAM-71, Playing Time 39:49After 3 consecutive live albums, 999 released ""YUI"" back in 1993, their first studio since ""Lust Power And Money"".Frankly, you can't tell it's been that long. The band follow their recipe of 2-and-a-half-minute songs, but this time, it feels like the inspiration, at least lyrically, is gone. Simple melodies, lame lyrics, you can't help but think you've already heard all this but it used to be stronger, bolder, when attitude counted for something.You might even think this is a ""cover band"" of 999, but there's no mistaking the Cash/Days' sounds.Generally disappointing, there are still a few precious tracks, but not quite enough to make it a ""must have""."
3,Buy an RF Modulator if using with an older TV,"I'm rating this DVD/VCR player a tentative 3 stars because I have to give it a rating, but I haven't used it yet. I received it yesterday and when it wouldn't work I found out I needed another piece of equipment because I'm hooking it up to an older TV. Nowhere in the product description did it mention your TV needed A/V jacks, and since this is the first DVD player I've hooked up to an older TV, I didn't realize my current VCR/TV configuration wouldn't work with a replacemtent DVD/VCR player. After a little online research I found that an RF Modulator solves the problem. Check out Amazon's selection. Their prices, even with shipping charges, are better than what I could find locally."
3,I like Samsung DVDV5500,"From the price perspective, it is a very ""value-wise"" product. It fits basically all my needs. Easy to operate. Good and quality pictures. -Peter"
3,2nd Samsung VCR/DVD Combo,"This is my second Samsung VCR/DVD combo but I'm not sure I would buy another one. This time the first unit came with a VCR that was broken, Amazon was fantastic about returning it and sending another. Had new unit in a few days. This time everything worked okay. However it was not an easy setup and the manual left much to be desired. I guess for the cost it is okay but I think next time I will spend a little more to get something better."
2,DVD won't open if it enounters a lot of skipping.,"The DVD deck acts strange when it has a skip in the DVD. The DVD freezes and won't respond to any action like skip chapter and pause and forward. If it gets a bad enough skipping, it will stop playing and nothing happens. I tried taking out the DVD from the tray, but it doesn't even open. I unplugged it and waited for 5 minutes and came back to plug it in. The DVD still won't come out. Very poor design in this aspect. The VCR, i haven't tried using it. But overall I give it a low 2 stars."
2,Just ok,"The product description here is pretty slim so in case you were wondering... No, it does not play DVD-R/RW."
1,Find Another Cable,"I just got this cable. My first problem was that the CD that came with it had no drivers for en EnV VX9900 phone. After I found the drivers on the web, I found out that this cable will not charge the phone when it is connected to the USB port."
1,CD-ROM,The CD-ROM that came with the product was not set up for VISTA WINDOWS - other wise it was the correct USB cable........
1,Difficult and confusing,"I just bought this expecting a cd for a driver installation and the cable.However, the driver cd is confusing and quite sketchy and the usb cable doesn't seem to register with my laptop or my phone.you are probably just better off spending the money on a cable directly from verizon and knowing it'll work."
2,USB Data Cable,This USB Cable is not the highest quality as you could tell by the price. I connected it the first time to my phone and part of the connector broke off and got jammed in my phone and I had to remove it with needle nose plyers. The drivers seem to work ok if you only need to syncronize music through Windows Media Player. I would recommend purchasing a micro SD card instead of using this cable. You can upload and download stuff directly to that card through your compluter instead of dealing with cables. Just my opinion.
4,A good book but where's the scares?,"This was a good book, however to me it was more like an adventure than anything else. It wasn't scary at all. However if you are the type that likes witches, then you may like this book. I thought the main reason that it wasn't scary was, because the author told you an explaination for everything. Anther reason I have is that Diana never seemed evil.Other than that it was a pretty good book. It was boring and the style was interesting."
3,steve miller,"liked this album 25 years ago, still do, brings back the good old days will listen to songs on ipod"
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"This is a good inspirational book don't get me wrong, however it just wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting more of a book instead of short daily inspriations I guess. Maybe I just didn't read the details prior to purchuse well enough I don't know. It does cover some from a fathers side instead of just how the mother feels after a full term loss. We lost our daughter three days before a scheduled c-section...ten days before my due date. She was beautiful 9lbs 4oz, 21 inch long. The hardest thing my family has had to go thru. Does give the reader a sense of hope and the feeling that they are not the only ones experiencing the vast emotions associated with a loss."
3,Not Connie Steven's best.,"Connie Stevens' voice conveys such a sense of joy, energy, and assessibility, that a person would have to be comatose not to be charmed by her. That's why I have to regret saying this album is not all that I hoped it would be. There are three or four standards that are enjoyable. But there are too many dated arrangements to make this album one that I could heartilty recommend. If I had to choose her best CD, it would be the one entitled ""From Me to You."""
1,First attempt.,I can't get it to work. The download completed. The title appears in my media library. But when I click to view it a symbol comes saying that it is loading and it continues forever until I cancel it. I don't know how to get help with this. How do you contact customer service?
5,Fast and easy,Clinique facial soap is the best. I made my order and the next week it was in. Fast and easy.
5,ear candy,"First of hopefully many recordings to come from a great band. Call it roots rock, trouble country or whatever, it's great rock and roll that just happens to have a mix of intelligent lyrics and great musicianship."
5,Not original but fun...,"The World of Narue has an alien girl trying to fit Earth society. The trouble is that the story really does not focus that much on the alien part, allowing Narue to truly overcome all barriers with ease. Well, they had to move fast with only 12 episodes. That, and maybe a tad too much fan services, is the only real complains I can say about the anime.The artwork is great, the development of the characters is touching and brings real warmth to the events, and they have cute combat scenes. Well, they do. Combat bunny girl robots!The story touches on everything from the first date, cosplay, bikinis, the science behind traveling at light speed. you name it! A real gem.I don't think I know any of the voice actors, which is good but sad. Good because now I have more people to look up and see what other work they have done. Sad because many people, not knowing them, may not end up picking up this series."
4,Funny and Charming.....,This book is definitely a heart warmer. The main characters are passionately real and they touch your soul. The secondary characters are so friendly you wish there were more people like them. Only four stars because some of the writing was confusing. Also the author could have weaved more of the two main children into the storyline. This is a calm cozy by the fire story that you should read if you are in need of compassion!!!
3,"What is ""October""?","I'm interested in this book, but all the critical comments give me pause. What is ""October""? It seems that these authors are perceived as powerful/dominant. Why? (Please disregard the 3-star rating I gave; Amazon's system required me to rate the book.)"
3,Blah Book,"I was under the impression that I needed this book for a class on contemporary art. After reading the first few assigned sections for homework, I was turned off from even looking at the pieces I found to be interesting. I have a hard time reading history books in general, but this one is very opinionated and does not explain the works on a level that I understand. If you are taking an art history class and are recommended to use this book for it, please ask your professor if there are other options. Aside from being difficult to read, this book is very pricey and not even worth keeping for reference."
2,These are Dance Hits?,"I feel that if a song is already fast and dance-oriented, there's no need to remix it. I think the original versions of ""Two of Hearts"" and ""Let the Music Play"" should have been used for this reason. I also don't feel that most of these could even be classified as dance songs because they were slow and had no energy to them at all. I was not a fan of this CD even though I thought I would be."
3,I Speak Life,"This just was no the disc I was looking for, cannot remember the name of the one that I am looking for, but I will be getting the correct one later."
3,I Speak Life,"No doubt, Donald Lawrence love's God, but this album lacks something. I can't quite put my hand on it. I guess the best way I can explain it is to compare him to other artist: J. Moss, Byron Cage and Fred Hammon are in much higher leagues. This album will probably not be one of my favorites.J. Azikiwe"
4,"An elegantly crafted, melodic debut","I was quite interested in hearing what Mono's Siobhan De Mare and Cocteau Twins' Rubin Guthrie's new project Violet Indiana was like. Was it going to be a blatant [take on] of Mono or Cocteau Twins? Well, it turned out that ""Roulette"" sounded like neither. Violet Indiana is an entity of its own. I'll admit I wasn't sure what to make of ""Roulette"" while listening to the first track ""Air Kissing"". Luckily I had nothing to worry when ""Air Kissing"" segued into ""Busted"", the second track of the album. In the grand tradition of trip hop music, the music is light and airy with the delicate vocals of Siobhan De Mare. The music itself isn't really innovating to be honest but I enjoyed the duo's debut album."
2,ehhh not so much,"out of the box the smell almost knocked me over. It smelled like the inside of new tire. I figured it would go away after awhile. Nope. Even after using it my hands smelled the same. It was worth a try as the price was right, but it is not anywhere in my car now. The smell was giving me a headache. I have let it air out in my garage but it still smells like a mix between gasoline and fresh rubber. Looked good though, worked fine."
3,its live all right,"the cardio boot camp is the same as the original cadio DVD with maybe a few new moves and its a slightly faster pace than teh regular cardio DVD. cant go wrong with tae-bo tho, great buy!"
1,Not Impressed,"These boots are not cute at all, the suede is really of cheap quality, the detail of the boost is lost in the poor construction of the boot, what has the potential to be a nice boot is so poorly crafted the belt dosen't even come all the way around the boot it stops at the zipper giving it a generic look the heel looks more like a block of hard dark glue.the price for these are $75.00 at zappos and $59.95 at amazon I paid $35.00 so I'll lose money returning them that sucks because these boots aren't worth losing any money on. Oh and they hurt.they look more like there for a animated cartoon character- timberland makes much better quality suede boots!"
4,Pyle outdoor speakers,Speakers were a very good value and sound nice. The only bummer wasthe threaded inserts on the speaker housing did not match the hardwaresupplied to install the speaker correctly.
4,Anticipation,"Certainly the best part of this Kleypas novel is the anticipation of wanting to know if Hunter is actually Hunter or not; with this premise as the central part of the story, the novel holds the reader's interest. The character of Larissa (Lara) is not one of Kleypas's better written women, but Hunter is riveting. The subplot of Lara's sister and her abusive relationship is rather harsh and, to be honest, realistic for a romance novel; it will definitely either make or break the novel's enjoyment for readers."
5,can't put it down...,This is one of those romance books you just can't put down. The characters bounced off well and the story line was also interesting. This was my first book I've read of Ms. Kleypas and it wont' be my last. I loved her style of writing and I recommend this book even if it didn't end the way I wanted to...
3,Typos too much to take - Kindle edition,"This was the first Lisa Kleypas book I've read. I don't even think I've seen or read about 'Sommersby' or the other titles this book is supposed to be similar to.I really liked the book and would rate it alot higher except for one thing - all the typos.I actually reported all the typos - I hope they fix them.When I'm reading a book, I don't want to have to stop and decipher what the words are supposed to be. And the times 'Lara' is called Laura; or Crossland is Cross land or Grassland - it just got to be too much. And those were the easy to decipher typos.My review is from the kindle version - I returned it because of the typos - I would definitely get this book again if they fixed all the typos."
5,A great romance!,"I was lucky enough to be asked by Lisa's editor to quote this book and loved it. The story is very compelling, the characters truly sympathetic and the plot was just great--with lots twists and turns and surprises. Just wonderful!"
4,Mighty good...,"I absolutely loved Hunter, without a doubt. Lara did, at times, get on my nerves but she came through at the end. Janet and Arthur were just scum. Rachel was crazy for always making excuses for her abusive husband. And Johnny was adorably.It was, overall, a great read but it was a little wordy for me. I found myself skimming over a lot of details on what everyone was wearing. I know it makes a book larger but I really don't care for all that descripton. I just like to get to the meat of the story. But that's just me.I would recommend this book to all romance readers."
2,this item is Iffy,This scale is a big bulky but i purchased it hoping for accuracy and tells me what I want to here but I don't know how accurate it is. It always reads accurate for me but my husband gets 5lbs different every time he steps on it.
5,Excellent tool for safety,"This is an excellent multi-purpose clamp (of course). But it's most importantly used to hold small items for routing, drilling, etc. ... good finger keeper."
2,Did I Expect Too Much?,"I am a fan of Ambrose Bierce, Poe, and Stevenson and was satisfied by their presentation. I am decidedly NOT a fan of Henry James, whom I consider a 19th century Eric Bentley, and was not surprised that his story set my teeth on edge. The remaining stories were listened to for the purpose of being able to say, ""I listened to them in their entirety."" Based on that, I may voice my opinion, which is that they were not only misplaced in a collection of ""Tales for a Stormy Night"", but would have been misplaced in a collection of ""Tales for ANY Night"". Another grisly tidbit: The 're-enactments'(rather than 'readings') seemed to serve as a sounding board for frustrated/mediocre actors who were committed to giving the texts their unbridled self-indulgence and much puzzling auditory gnashing of teeth amidst screeching falsetto and booming basso profundo. If possible, listen before purchase."
2,"Great ""Disposable"" System","This particular device is not worth any money put into it. The one I had, as well as a few friends, all had the same problem or similar. Mine, the dvd was no longer receiving the signal from the remote after having it barely a year. I called and had the remote replace, which worked for a week and then died. Other problems friends have had are that it will only play 10 minutes of a dvd before turning off. If you only want a dvd player for a year or less this is a great item for you. If you want one with stamina to last longer than its warranty, dont bother."
1,Go Find Another,"I have had mine for about 3 months. VHS works fine but machine makes grinding noises during playback. Biggest problem is with DVD player - every DVD gets ""stuck"" about 2/3 through the movie. I can't even make it stop or eject without turning the machine off. It sometimes gives a bad DVD message or no DVD message for DVD's I've played before. It was inexpensive, but even still I didn't get a good year out of it."
4,Conan?,"OK. Understand this. I have been a Conan fan since the early '70s. Started on the L. Sprague De Camp reprints of his original Robert E. Howard stories and the ""Savage Sword of Conan"" stories from Marvel Comics. I like this movie. It is imperfect, but closer to the actual character of Conan than the previous Arnold movies. They were good movies, but they weren't about Conan. Love the detail to the Hyborian Age, very accurate. And this story wasn't what I hoped, but it is what I can settle for. Fun, violent, sexy, hard-core. Enjoy"
3,Meh,"Oh geez, what can I say but meh. I just say that because I had my hopes set way too high. It was entertaining but I am glad I did not spend $20 to see it in the theater. $2.00 to watch at home is worth it."
1,Epic Fail,"All the parts are there, but... but... this movie sucks. Really sucks. No depth, no decent dialogue, no continuity, no epci feel, blood for bloods sake, and no heart. Save you money, buy hammer and break your own fingers. That'll be less painful."
2,Are you kidding me?,I watched this movie for the first time last night and it had to be one of THE WORST movies I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the original Conan franchise and Arnold. The blood and gore was just way to fake and unrealistic.
3,"Bland, and missing the original conan crew with arnold","If people are looking to get their money's worth i would recommend skipping this film because although great promise from the start it's just horrible. I am being nice in giving it 3 stars just because of the action and ""toughness"" that comes across from certain roles in trying to portray the unconquering manliness and warrior like undefeated spirit. I was not impressed with Mr. Mom. as conan and miss arnold. It wouldn't hurt this guy to beef up for a role like conan. I just remembering not being impressed with this film and wanting my money back.....Not recommended. I am trying to search for something good to say but alas ..THE END.lol Gobbless. Merry Christmas. praise Jesus~shauns movie review"
3,Silly,"The up side is I only paid $.99 to see this waste of money, effort and talent. The down side is I spent the time and bandwidth necessary to see it."
3,It was good,"I'm not here to compare this film to the original Conan, as other reviewers have already covered that much better than I can. If you looking for some entertainment that's got plenty of action this version of Conan provides it. Though very predictable, this film is good and goes well with some popcorn on a Saturday night."
2,"interesting at first, but got boring quickly - even turned it off half-way through","I was excited to watch this movie, but was quite disappointed with it. Started off interesting, but got boring - story seemed to go nowhere and make no sense. I just eventually turned it off and watched something else instead."
4,Enjoyed it...,"Alright, the story was kind of weak, considering all the sources the writers had to draw on. And did Rose McGowan really turn down Red Sonja to play this role?I enjoyed the movie. Don't get me wrong, I'd watch Jason Mamoa do anything, but I genuinely like him as Conan. That little kid who played Conan at the first of the movie kicked butt. The action was good, and the story didn't get bogged down. I prefer it to Arnold's versions, and hope they make another."
2,TV movie,"To be short and sweet, if you enjoy TV movies ala Scyfy channel type of movies then by all means rent/buy this."
4,Its just fun,This movie was just mindless fun. I liked the Arnold one but was not in love with it and it was timeto move on. This was more fun then that one and I must say the Actor was better. Its sad there will be no more and they have gone back to what was oh well. If you like fun fantasy action movies then try it out.
1,Conan the boaring,This is a C movie where blood and shouting like a angry Brown bear is used as a substance for bad acting in a film that is like short random sketches.
2,A BIG DUD.,"HELLO,THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, SO TAKE IT AS SUCH. THIS MOVIE SUCKED. THE ORIGINAL CONAN WAS AND STILL IS, THE ONLY ONE. ARNOLD WOULD HAVE MADE LIGHT WORK OUT OF THIS DUDE. YOU CAN NOT MAKE UP FOR ACTING WITH SPECIAL EFFECTS. THE CAST OF THE ORIGINAL WAS GREAT. THIS NEW ONE, NOT SO MUCH. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE NOT NAMED IT CONAN.THANKS"
1,"Violence, violence and just more violence!!!!","Probably the worst movie I have seen! Just a series of cliche special effects and comic book writing. The characters have no development. At least in the original Conan, you can seen his development and how he became the character. The music in the original Conan might have been corny but at least memorable. The fight scenes seem a bit too staged and the same flipping in the air ballet fight sequences are like others you have seen in several others movies. In my opinion, waste of two hours. For me to take the time to write this review just states how bad this movie really is. Don't waste your time. Stinko!!!"
3,Arnold was better,"This is not a good remake. Arnold would take home te top prize with his take on Conan. If you have nothing better to do and want to end up brain dead, this is the movie for you."
1,Worst Conan...EVER!,"Wow, I am so glad I didn't go to Theaters to see this one.If you liked the classic Conan movies this one will be hard to watch.I just want to know why the bad guy screams ""Kali-Ma"" as he falls to his death?"
1,Another mindless action movie,"Essentially its ""300"" meets ""The Mummy"" with the baser aspects of each, non-stop action in the usual canned fashion, gore, blood, guts, boobs. Great if your a 10 year old boy, not so great if you are looking for things like plot and character development, and find canned action movies like this tedious and boring. Fast food movie making for the masses."
4,It's a sword and sandals movie Folks !!!!,"Not to tire you with a blow by blow of this movie. It's much better than Arnie's version in many ways. It's a fantasy movie so don't go in there expecting a BBC version of Howard's works. I think you should rent it as it's not for everyone, especially the amount of blood spilled. But saying that, it IS what Conan does well :) and it portrays that idiom in a very faithful way to both comics and text book's. I enjoyed it and thats all I cared about ."
3,I loved Arnold S.,"But he in the version of the tale was nothing compared to this one. Better acting, better story line, etc. All in all, both movies are mindless brutality, and really dumb, but this one is better."
1,No redeeming qualities whatsoever,"There's no reason whatsoever to watch this, even for free (which I did). It brings nothing to the table. The villain turns out to be really weak, too, almost pathetic in their ""climactic"" battle. A complete waste of time."
4,Crom would be pleased,"Conan is not a fantastic movie but it is a good movie. I found it better than the Scorpion King and just as good as The Prince of Persia. It has a good story with a nice array of characters to fill the world of Conan and for those who thirst for blood there is plenty of it splashing the screen. All the actors do a great job in their roles, the special effects are just right not to over the top and the enviornments fit the feel of the movie perfectly. This movie wont blow you away but it will entertain you. I was a big fan of the comic book series back in the day and with so many stories available I hope there will be many sequels to come."
2,2 stars for cinematography,Camera work and effects were great. It had some nice pace of action and the actor played a good Conan but plot and character development were non existant sadly. The original still the best Conan movie if only for its charm.
5,conan the barbarian,conan the barbarian is a great action movie. my husban and i both enjoyed the movie. has a great story line.
5,This Book is For Everyone,"The protagonist of this story is an ordinary man who must face extraordinary challenges. The twist is that he willingly faces these challenges to uncover a mystery about his world and himself. If you too have ever wondered about your own true nature, then this book is for you. If you have sought more than many religions are willing to offer, then this book is for you. If you seek answers to the questions of life, this book will not provide them, but rather help you realize that the answers are within you."
1,Didn't work for me,"I've burned 700-800 disks since I got my burner, so I think I know how to do it by now. With other disks, I usually have problems with maybe 4 or 5 out of a spindle of 100. With the memorex media, I had to waste 3 or 4 cd's for each successful burn. Might be a compatability issue - or maybe just a bad batch. I'm going back to Imation."
2,Disappointing for the nostalgic,"My 6-year-old daughter received the pink Lite Brite as a Christmas gift. She has a very long attention span and has been playing with it for a while, but I am truly disappointed that it isn't more like the Lite Brite I grew up with.This toy's biggest flaw is that it shuts off after 3 minutes. Great, the unit shuts off to conserve battery power (3 D batteries, no less) and must constantly be turned back on. No, there is no way to turn it on and leave it on.It does have a nice storage tray for the pegs, can be laid flat, and can easily be carried from place-to-place. Given its major design flaw, I hope the giver of this gift didn't pay too much for it. It may retail for around $10.00, but how much more will we spend on batteries over the years?"
4,Makin' Things with Light,"Lite Brite was one of my favourite toys as a child. The model I grew up with was almost as large as a small TV set, and featured an incandescent bulb that made the box grow hot to the touch. How things have changed. This modern incarnation of Lite Brite runs on batteries, and automatically shuts off a period of non-use. The bulb is considerably cooler. I gave this as a gift to my nephews and they all pretty much love it. Thanks for keeping the memories alive."
1,Enough of the nonsense already!!!,"There are a whole host of amazing books out there but this is clearly not one of them.What ""possessed"" the author to come up with such pathetic contents?Have you noticed how some of the reviews are sent in more than once just to improve the ratings? Obviously that would be the case, considering that those that wrote positive reviews have personally met or are friends of the author."
5,Gratitude to Peace Mother,"Peace Mother is the clearest channel of Spirit that I've ever encountered. Her wisdom and compassion are truly inspiring. Not only that- she walks the talk, serving humanity 24/7. This book is just one example of this. In it she offers us all tools we can use every day to protect and expand the precious Light of Spirit within. The writing is straightfoward and accesible, as Peace Mother challenges us to live as ""Impeccable Warriors of Light""."
1,C.D sound quality is terrible,"Please do not purchase this c.d. It was horrible the sound quality was awful in fact when I was importing the c.d. to my I-Pod there was a conflict in importing that caused my I-Pod to shut down. However, after listening to it, my intent was to remove it, my suggesting would be DO NOT PURCHASE.It seems like it was from a third world country. Very poor....... Please note this review is no reflection on the seller....."
1,Don't buy this book,"I was very disappointed with this book, especially since I'm a Birnbaum fan. Although it has nice color glossy pages, it is short with not much relevant information. If you are going on a Disney Cruise, you MUST get Passporters Field Guide. It is excellent in every area. Lots of tips and inside information to make your cruise smooth sailing!"
1,Sloppy Logic,"The logic in the book is sloppy.One example is the calculation of average days between the touches of a trendline. Example: page 46, ""The trendline started on March 26, 1993 and the last monor low, point 5, was on October 26, 1993. The number of days between these two dates is 214...... Thus, the fives touch.....are an average of 43 days apart.""How can they be 43 days apart(214 / 5 = 43). They should be 54 days ( 214 /(5-1) = 54) days apart."
2,THIS CD IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"I purchased this CD for my 1985 Mercedes 300sd. It provided little information on vehicle repair.It had all the service bulletins however.If you want that, then I recommend the cd. However, If you are looking for a REPAIR guide, this CD is not for you."
1,Junk and no service,"I have purchased three of these, everyone of them failed. Thirty day warranty is not enough to cover the eventual problems that occur. The dock, while functioning, was just what I was looking for. I have never bought a more worthless item, to date!!"
2,Great for very small music collections,"I had been eyeing the Keyspan Tuneview for months, but decided to hold out for another system. When DLO released this device I decided to pull the trigger. After purchasing it and getting everything hooked up (which was easy), I could not get the iPod to synch with HomeDock. After trying every trouble shooting tip in the manual and trying a few of my own, I decided to email DLO to find out if I just had a defective system. Turns out you can only synch upto 50 playlists and 200 artists. I exceeded the artists by about 3X. I do appreciate DLO getting back to me so I could return the system. Hopefully they will increase the memory very soon. I decided to write a review so others understand the limitations... and DLO decides to improve their product."
1,"bad out of box , with poor service from DLO","This product was bad out of box. Returned item to DLO, with no information availible from DLO with status for over 2 weeks.DLO now claims it was sent out in the US mail and now over 2 weeks lost. I am very dissatisfied with this product and DLO themselves.I am a power limited Technician and deal with suround and central audio systems in commercial and residential construction, but this piece will not be included in myy future installations. I am glad I fought with this instead of one of my customers!!!.Which if I may add , is the only bright spot in this ordeal."
3,V. Good,"A very touching novel. It depicts many of the aspects of the events of September 11th in the story, and brings it to life."
4,Easy To Use,"Very easy to use software. Does not have all bells and whistles that a CAD software application has but gets the basic job done. After my first plan was created, I made modifications to it easily. The second plan I created went much faster and again after creating the first pass tweaked it some more until I was comfortable with final result. I am using it to make time spent with architect more valuable and he/she can easily see what I have in mind before he/she does my REAL drawings. Still do not know how to use all the features."
3,Still not easy,"I was looking for an easy way to mock up some home designs so there would be a visual that could be discussed. The software can not make up for my lack of artistic ability and I ended up not being able to generate anything useful.Today I would try to use sketchup, a free tool from google to generate similar ideas in visual form to discuss."
4,"Very good, but had faults.","911's album Moving on.This album had some very good tracks on it which were very well done, and seemed to show how much the group has changed since their first album The Journey was released. This album was different to the first album and seemed that it was not as well put together. Some of the tracks seemed hastily made and not very well mixed, for example, the actual song `Moving On' seemed rather shabby and was not of the quality that you would expect from a group such as 911. However, the singing was brilliant and the rest of the tracks were excellent. Even though this was not there best album and it did have some definite faults, I loved this album and would really strongly recommend it to anyone who likes 911."
1,DEFINITELY NOT FUNNY... WEAK AND VERY MESSY,"I wasted 2 valuable hours on this piece of garbage. Eddie Griffin and Orlando jones are WASTED in this movie. You can tell that they have true raw comedic talent, but the script doesn't do anything to really showcase their abilities. Griffin was funny for like 5 seconds and then he becomes just plain annoying. Everything about this movie is like an overstuffed burrito: JUST PLAIN MESSY. I must've laughed about 2 times during the entire movie. If you MUST see this movie, don't buy it, don't rent it, just borrow it. Trust me, whoever you borrow it from is going to be eager to part with it."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"Horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad complicated plot. Not funny."
3,Pretty funny,"Pretty funny but everything in this comedy of errors seems like it&#65533;s all been done before. Orlando Jones is a wealthy Wall Street businessman who gets caught up in a murder set-up and has no idea how to prove his innocence. Eddie Griffin is the incoherent bumbling idiot who keeps getting in his way of clearing his name&#65533;.or is he? Lots of twists and turns, most of them predictable, but all of them enjoyable and the two leads do very well. Remake of Ken Annakin's Across The Bridge."
1,Yawn,"In the beginning, nothing happens, characters are lackluster and the names bordering on ridiculous. Add to that the constant perspective shifts that work for numerous other authors, end abruptly without any true resolution to the scenes. In a later scene, sometimes the action may be summed up from the previous one, sometimes not. In the second half of the book, it is more of the same. I gave up at page 316. It was like reading a dry rambling lecture that puts one to sleep so that if there is a kernel of substance, it gets missed. Sorry, but I will not pick up another book by the author. My time and money are too precious to waste."
1,Really mediocre until the end where it gets downright bad.,"What seems like an interesting attempt at something different quickly loses its way and becomes trite. The concept of mapmakers being the all powerful is interesting. However, the story bogs down with uninteresting characters, locales, and plot threads. You care about no one in this story and they mostly do nothing. Just when (about 3/4 of the way through the book) you're resigned to the mediocrity, the story takes a nasty, gruesome, misogynist bent. I soooo wanted to mail the book to the author with some suggestions for a new career. Just avoid it...really."
2,Jesus & the riddle of the dead sea scrolls,"Book is a straight copy of Jesus the Man, which I bought 6 months ago."
5,"One of my favorite books, and it's still available!",This book is available under the title Jesus the Man. If you like this book I recommend The Book that Jesus Wrote by Barbara Thiering
3,es Florida,"nice pedal, but a little hard to install .......Without the tool to do it with,probably you will have to have it installed .."
1,"Rigid, Stale and Narrow Minded","If you really must study every Old and New Testament occurrence of words pertaining to creativity and artists and musicians, go ahead and get this book, it leads you through a topical word study.If you want a book in creativity with a decidedly Christian slant that will help you understand your creative nature and why you may be blocked creatively, I recommend the book The Creative Call instead of this one. The Creative Call is much more in depth, and has exercises designed to help you understand how creativity works.If you are secure enough to know that a book does not have to include strictly ""evangelically Christian"" language in order to be helpful, go ahead and enjoy The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron and/or Creativity for Life by Eric Maisel, PhD. Ms. Cameron and Dr. Maisel are both the most in-depth authors and counselors regarding creativity issues, and both have a nice series of books that are time tested by many many other creative types."
3,"Thrilled, but disappointed.","I bought this book because of Linda Howard's short story, ""Blue Moon."" I was disappointed that she had the shortest entry in the book. The other stories were okay. I really wanted more from the Howard storyline. The story was great, there just wasn't enough of it."
1,owned this for 2 months and it broke,"was kicking the bike over and it broke right at the transmission casei bought Jims becasue i thought it was a good name and part, but i was mistaken"
3,It Drips,"Most of the reviewers here mentioned that it has a large area for air. It has 30 ounce capacity- small, so when I poured an entire battle of wine it almost had no space left for air but the neck part. Most annoyingly it drips a lot so have a roll of towels handy."
3,Less Bites. Still Itchin and Bitten.,"The insect varmints won't let us enjoy our backyard deck so I thought I'd give this Cutter spray a try. About an hour before we went outside,I sprayed the product all around the area we'd be sitting and took care to first read and follow the direcions on the can. The Cutter has a somewhat pleasing smell that lingered for quite a while after application. Expecting a restful, bitefree evening we sat outside for an hour or so until the bugs drove us inside.The biting swarm had been worse on the deck, but I was hoping for better after applying the Cutter Outdoor fogger. I do like that the product comes out of the can in large, visible droplets so that the user can easily keep track of where the fogger has been sprayed.I can compare the fogger experience to taking medicine for a headache. The pain was cut in half, but the headache was still there, just to a lesser degree."
5,Great bedtime story book,Read this to my kids when they were young so much that it came apart and had to get a replacement. To this day they can quote most of the rhymes by heart.
5,Great introduction to Bible stories for toddlers!,"This is a great 1st Bible for small children (2-6). The rhyming format and vivid illustrations on each page are great for keeping the attention of little ones. I was also pleased that, although paraphrases, the stories generally remain true to the Biblical text. I read 2-3 stories from this book to my 5-year-old daughter nearly every night. We've gone through the entire book several times and just keep starting over again!"
5,Good retelling of stories,"AGE: 2-6FORMAT: 35 of the most famous--and most gentle--Bible stories in heavily illustrated 10-15 page bouncy poems that are actually pleasant and engaging.FAITHFULNESS: There is occasional softening of the stories to make them gentler and milder, but there is almost no editorializing despite the fact that the stories are completely rewritten to make them rhyme.ILLUSTRATIONS: Bright illustrations are engaging but not special.USEFULNESS: Good for bedtime devotions for the very young, and great for keeping attention. Not *terribly* useful beyond the narrative itself, and children in Christian homes should be very familiar with most of the stories quite young, so they won't be new to any but the youngest. There is a Rhyme Bible for toddlers, but I wouldn't want this simplified any further."
4,fun,"must be used on a firm surface, not carpet. But it's a lot of fun, even for the grownups in the house! I was actually looking for more of a balancing toy, but this one requires memory and attention more than balance. It reminds me of Simon, except it uses your legs instead of hands."
3,lots of fun and good exercise,"Bought this for my five year old granddaughter. She tried it out and enjoyed it, or so it seemed. I think she has the attention span of a speed bump, otherwise, I think she would have really enjoyed it. Everyone else had fun with it."
5,Just what we needed,Gross motor and balance is not my 7 year old son's greatest strength. I have been looking for fun ways for him to improve his balance and strengthen is body without burning him out. He loves the Wobble deck.
2,A bit disapointed,I was very excited to get this for my two sons- but they have difficulty working it correctly. They have taken to standing next to it and stomping the correct color as when they stand on it and shift the game does not register the movement. I will keep messing with it to see if we are having some form of user error- but so far I have not been to impressed.
2,yeah...,"It worked great for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it just went dead... Now if this was maybe 2 or 3 months it would be fine, except for one factor:THEY MARKET IT WITH REMOVABLE HEADS AND BATTERIES. Why pretend that the product is sustainable if it isn't? I didn't abuse the toothbrush in anyway and barley got any water on it (although thats what toothbrushes do) and it still broke..I opened it up and tried to replace the batteries and I could smell that the motor burnt out. Bought an Oral-B Pulsar today, hopefully that will work out better. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Battery compartment won't close,"It does work well when you get it. I use it once a day (regular brushes the other times) because I worry about whether it's too harsh, but that's just my own thing which may have no basis in fact. Be aware that there are some replacement brush-heads that only have the top part spinning, and the bottom part doesn't move. I think those ones are not labeled ""whitening.""Anyway, after a few months I have trouble getting the battery cover closed all the way. When it comes too far open, the batteries lose contact and it shuts off. I've actually cracked the housing trying to get it closed. THe problem is getting worse and worse to the point where it's almost unusable now."
1,The WORST toothbrush EVER!,This toothbrush lasted all of three weeks. Water gets into the battery compartment and ruins the batteries.Save your money for an Oral-B toothbrush.
3,flashbacks-pop parade,"not really overly impressed,disappointed is the word.video too short.to much writing on the screen.It could have been better,than 30 min. long,barely worth the $$.."
1,"Like many others users here, my ACOM HD failed within a year.","I bought the 160 GB version of this hard drive in order to back up my pictures, music, etc. Worked great while I had it, but it died not even a year after I bought it. I'll never buy this brand again."
2,Doesn't work with Windows XP Media Center,"I just replaced my old computer after the hard drive died with a new XP Media Center machine. I had all of my data backed up on the Acomdata USB 2.0/Firewire external hard drive and thought it would be a snap to move it over to the new computer. Wrong!! The external drive couldn't be seen by the new computer. I went to the Acomdata website where they said that this model isn't supported in the Media Center Edition at this time. So it's on to Plan B, C, and D to get my data back. Next time I'll buy a ""name"" brand that stays current with what's out there."
2,Not at all what I expected,"Although I am very much a fan of Royo's work, I was very dissapointed with this book. I guess it's my own fault for not reading enough about it before buying. I loved the cover illustration, but sadly, the contents were not as good. Most of the illustrations in this book are black and white, or nearly monochramatic, and small. The text I found had little to add to the illustrations. The pictures themselves start at tastefully erotic, but turn to very graphic sex acts by the end. Definitely not for kids, or the faint of heart. I found the most artfully rendered image to be the cover, and I didn't feel it was worth the money. If you're looking for a book of full color paintings of Royo's best erotic work, this is NOT the one to get."
4,Great for private veiwing.,"But if your like me you tend to leave books lying around and carrying them places, I would recommend not having this book around others who are not likeminded. This was quite a big shift from Prohibited 2. The book contains a story which is slighty diffrent from the last one in that is goes along with the pictures. The story however, are more explict than that of 1 or 2. The quality of the art is improved, there are no longer sketches, but there are also no longer pieces such as the ""The Flight IV"" of 2."
3,Hit & Miss,"I found this book a combination of general historical facts intermixed with some great technical drawings. To be honest, the history of the ship didn't take up too much space in the book, and it was vague at best. A detailed account of its design history and battles across the Pacific would have been more interesting if it was not done is a form of bullet-point. Many of the CAD drawings are good, particularly the cutaway of the of the ship, as well as many of the other sections of the ship. I thought the detailed drawing of the bridge to be overkill and self-indulgence. I found it strange that there was little to no historical information on the different types of aircraft carried throughout the Pacific War and/or squadron information. This book should have dedicated a chapter or two designated to it. This ship is an aircraft carrier and should have more dedicated to its reason for being other than a few drawings at the end."
5,Better with each listen,"I've had this album for awhile now, and it just keeps getting better. Every time I listen, I have a new favorite song. Lynn Miles has a wonderful gift for emotive lyricism, running the gamut from lovestruck to melancholy to bitter, and always cuts straight to the soul. ""Rust"", in particular, may be the most beautiful and brazenly honest love song ever written. The instrumentation is rich and varied without burying her vocals. Thae fact that this album has not received more of an audience is a shame; anyone who is a fan of modern folk/americana would do well to add this to their collection"
2,What are you people talking about?,"I am amazed at the reviews I have seen here. I really do not understand. Lynn's first CD was a masterpiece, one of the greatest CD's by a female artist I have ever heard and probably the only one I listen to on a regular basis these many years later...Night in a strange town, however, was an enormous letdown. I bought it as soon as I saw it, just assuming it must be great. Wow was I disappointed. I thought, well, maybe it will grow on me. I listened to it about 20 times, it [didn't], and I sold it to a used CD store for 3 bucks. I was sad."
5,Carl Sagan's Best Book***,"I think this is Carl Sagan's best book (he also thought it was his best book - see William Poundstone's biography of Carl Sagan, excellent bio:Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos). It is so well-researched, so thorough, so informational, yet so readable. This book is a must have for anyone interested in human evolution, human behavior (especially as it applies to all our living cousins, the chimps), and how and why we got here and the way we humans are today)..."
2,Shadows of forgotten ancestors,"Read this 5 months ago. Yes, it's grown on me to an extent, but not in a good way. Carl Sagan is clearly a clever guy, who knows his evolutionary biology. It's written in sharp, polished prose, which draws in (rather than puts off) the layperson. Having spoken to some of my science friends from university, however, it's clear that his views on extra-terrestrial intelligence are not mainstream. In isolation, that's okay, but you need to offer good quality evidence to back it up. Sagan doesn't really do this, and should therefore be more suggestive."
3,Not the cliff notes version,"I listened to these CD's in my car during my commute and they did help solidify what I had read. Though when I tried to skip ahead and just listen to the CD's, without first fighting through the book, I was totally lost. Good for REVIEW, don't buy if you are looking for the cliff notes version."
5,Best Kept secret for Arthritis,"This book helped me so much. My Rheumatologist prescribed hydroxycholoroquine for my arthritis about 5 years ago. I had it so bad I could hardly walk. I could not bend my wrists or ankles. I was in so much pain. But the drug required that I see an opthomologist twice a year because there was a rare chance it could blind me! I didn't like the sound of that, so I sought alternatives. I found this book and followed the instructions the best I could. Now I am nearly pain free- have been for about 5 years - and I take absolutely no drugs for my arthritis! This book is a Godsend!"
5,AWESOME,Beware!!!!! Plan ahead... make sure you have plenty of time before you started 'coz you wont even wanna take a bathroom break unless you take your kindle with you... very gripping. FABULOUS!!!
3,Only buy if you are using for decoration.,I bought this set to go with my coffee themed kitchen. I wanted kitchen towel to actually use but also an oven mitt to hang on the wall that would be only used for decoration. The set is very nice looking. So far the towels have been very durable. The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because the other reviewer was right. Don't use the oven mitt unless you want a burn. It is very thin and not at all good at protecting your hand. But if you are buying this for purely decoration it will serve the purpose nicely.
4,"Robert Parker ""Parker's wine buyers guide""","Generally an excellent book. However, I was suprised to find no mention of Canadian wines. Having recently visited the Niagra region and tasted their produce, I find them the equal of many of the world's wines. This would seem to be an important omission in what is regarded as the premier wine book."
2,"""out of date before published"" or ""i need to go to germany""","total submission to terry theise and rudy weist. there are other great estates. go find them. otherwise, generally good. no comparison to exhaustive and excellent bordeaux and rhone books."
2,Bland,"The Four Seasons was my first novel by Mary Alice Monroe.It's the story of the four Season sisters: Jillian, Beatrice, Rose, and Meredith. The novel opens when the sisters reunite for Merry's funeral, and it takes its shape from her final request - that they find the child, now an adult, that one of them gave up for adoption as a teen.I confess that I didn't find anything unique or particularly interesting here. Her theme seems to be the effect of the past on the present and the necessity to break down walls and 'share.' I felt rather battered over the head by her heavy handed didacticism by the time I finished the novel, but at least I did finish it.I suppose my verdict is 'so/so.'"
2,One Dimensional Characters,"I went in search of a touching yet humor filled story that provoked thought, discussion and action and ultimately chose Four Seasons as our book club pick based on reviews and research. I'm embarrassed as the story lacked depth, connectivity, and humor. The author skimmed along the top of major issues, dipped a toe in when the story was stuttering to a stop, then jumped out and flashed forward before you ""felt"" what she was trying to convey."
1,Stop the broken record,"This books is no different from any other book written by McQuaig. This means that the private sector is always bad, and if only the right (read socialist) people were running the government we would have a utopia. Mcquaig would do some good if she thought through the implications of her own arguments, if she did she would realize that her main point is that wealth creation is bad and that a world where we were all equally living in poverty rather would be superior to one in which wealth inequality exists."
5,Our Family Lives Out Of State,"This book arrived at the same time my husband went back east for a family wedding and was gone for a few days. I was able to read it to our 3 year old daughter and help her to understand that even though Daddy wasn't physically in front of her, he was loving her all the time. My parents (her grandparents) came for a visit and loved reading the book -- they even made up a little song to sing instead of reading it to her. We also had fun looking for all the hearts on every page. It's a great message and the pictures are fun. The message is made very clear so that any child could understand that even though someone isn't in your house with you, they may be in another state, at work -- anywhere --- they are thinking about you and loving you."
5,Wonderful book!!,We bought this book for our older daughter when she was 4 months old and have been reading it regularly for over 4 years and now we read it to our new baby as well. It's a great book with a wonderful message. The artwork is bold and bright and perfect for little eyes.
1,I was thrilled but my young teens couldn't stand it,"I heard the author when she was a guest on a local radio show and I was so impressed with her concept and personality. I thought it would be perfect for my young teens. I didn't think twice about spending the money to buy what I thought would be funny, and educational, CDs to listen to in the car. I figured we would all enjoy it. Well I was very disappointed because my children couldn't stand the style of it. They thought it was really dumb. My young teen said, ""The jokes weren't funny, her voice is irritating, the way she says thing is irriatating and it seems like she is talking to a 2 year old."" I think it comes down to style and taste, but in the case of my kids, it wasn't a fit. I regret having made the purchase now."
1,Annoying!!!!,"Anyone with a voice as annoying as this woman or girl???? should not produce an audio book.... Its impossible to learn when your distracted by this persons, voice... buyer beware"
2,"Disappointed in ""Not Too Scary Vocabulary""","When ordering this product I thought it would be interactive, not just a sound track of a very annoying voice. I have worked with other CD's on the computer & you not only had audio, but visual and the opportunity to test yourself through tests offered on the CD. I would not recommend this product unless the format was changed to offer the student an interactive experience."
2,Complex and slow for simple tasks,"I bought this program hoping to use it to lay out furniture in a new apartment. I found the software extremely difficult and inflexible, with bloated whistles and bells that took preference over basis features that would have been more useful. For example, there are numerous fabric types that can be selected for different furniture designs, but there is no simple way to create an accurate 2D floorplan with accurately-sized furniture. Frankly, a cardboard and plastic kit works much better than this product."
2,Great Book - Awful Condition,"I was very excited to find this book/journal for a good price on amazon. the shipping time was little long (but i had 3 items shipped together). When I got the item the day before the baby shower I was releaved. However, when I opened the package - the journal looked USED. I was expecting to open it up and see it already filled out! There was no padding/packaging in the box it came in and the outside of the journal was scratched and dirty. I was very close to not even giving this book as the gift it was intended to be...but since it was for a close friend I figured that she could look past the condition and enjoy the journal for what it was. The other 3 books were in fine condition - which means that this item was shipped in terrible condition from the beginning."
5,A wonderful baby book,"I have been looking for baby book for sometime and this one is the best. It's tasteful and sophisticated, no chessy cartoons. Illustrations are very nice and pretty and have space to let you write down all your memories. Definitely a very good baby book!"
1,Sub standard edition,"I had this book for my first child and liked it because it had pockets so I could put 'bulky' items in like hospital identity bracelets that wouldn't necessarily stick flat onto the pages like for example his first photo.I agree that there are so many sections that it is like writing a university thesis!Anyhow I ended up ordering another one for my second children however when it arrived I was very disappointed as the front cover was in a different language. I think it came from the reject pile because the rest of the book is in English including the side binder and back cover.Have emailed Amazon for advice as I live in Australia, but still waiting for response!Don't suppose I will get one."
3,works good,"This telescope is good for the price, The kids like it and its easy to use. Not real strong power though."
1,What am I missing?,"A spoiled brat lives in a fancy hotel in New York: that's kind of what this series boils down to for me.I read to my kids a lot, and this is the one series that I completely don't get: I don't see why it's funny or touching or...anything. Neither do my kids.Her language can be quite fun and ingenious, but holy cow...I don't understand all the fuss."
4,What's the point?,"I mean really, what is the point of paying this much online + shipping? I don't see how I'm saving any money. Where is my $5.00+ savings? I can buy this same exact product in the store less than a half mile from my house for 9 cents less. Just saying. Good product but very average price."
1,It's not what it Promises,"The basic idea of this CD was a good one - taking unused Ray Charles tracks and adding as backup the Count Basie Orchestra. However, there is a good reason these tracks were never used - they are awful. On most of the tracks, Ray Charles sounds like he is high on drugs. He had trouble sticking to the melody, and the Basie accompaniment only amplified the difference between a solid performance and what can best be called toss away material.These tracks should never have seen the light of day."
2,Listenable... but there's so much that is better,"Ray Sings, Basie Swings isn't a bad album... it just isn't very good.Other people have commented on the sound quality of this CD. For my tastes Ray's voice is flat and the Basie Orchestra isn't exactly on fire. So what...But in world where you can buy any one of a dozen of Ray Charles or The Count's best albums for less money than this album, why would you settle for this one?And you would get so much more out of them. This album is practically throwaway by comparison.For Ray Charles, try Genius Sings Soul, Genius Hits the Road, or Soul Brothers.For Count Basie, pick up Atomic Basie (or just about anything else he recorded WHILE HE WAS ACTUALLY ALIVE).Get it if you want it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just don't prepare to be amazed, because you won't be."
5,Phenomenal!,"This record sounds fantastic! Hats off to everybody involved with the project. Close your eyes, sit back, and enjoy the ride. Quincy Jones is right on the mark, as usual, with his remark that this record is one for the ages! Yes indeed it is!!!"
3,The author's second best.,A clever magic-act puzzle mystery but a bit belabored and not nearly as good as the author's One is a Lonely Number.
5,They never came home,"The book, They Never Came Home was a great book. Lois Duncan did a great job hooking a person into the book. I could not put the book down. It had a great twist to it. I love mysteries and this is one of the best mysteries I have ever read. Somehow I always found myself getting lost in the book. I am not that big of a reader and I rather watch TV. But I would definitely choose to read this book instead of watching TV. It is about two kids (Dan and Larry) that get lost in the mountains. Everyone thinks they are dead. But Larry's sister Joan gets a call from a guy that says that Larry owes him money. Now Joan believes that her brother is still alive. But she cannot ell anyone. Now it is all up to Joan and Dan's brother Frank to pay back the money and to find their brothers. But they find Joan finds out that her brother has been doing some bad things. If you want to read a great book They Never Came Home is the book for you."
3,No choices on the market,"I got this thermometer as a gift for my husband - he specifically wanted a digital version of the typical keychain thermometer. This was the only version I could find in my search. A big negative is that the thermometer does not read below 0 degrees. So when it's crazy cold, and you want to know just how crazy cold, you'll never know. Also, the guage seems off. For example, says our house is 65 degrees when it's more like 70. Maybe we're having user error - was it in a drafty spot? etc"
4,Good Book! Arrived Well!,This is a great book and it arrived when it was supposed to by Amazon. I recommend it for reading!
2,lots of parts to buy,"i was expecting an ""almost ready to fly"" kit and got this very basic kit. you will need to buy a reciever, servos, batteries and a bunch more to get this baby off the ground. i am sending it back much to my dissapointment, because the overall design and material look top notch. hope this was helpful to wanna be rc pilots and plz excuse my spelling.ps: no landing gear....."
1,Didn't get product yet.,Ordered 2/13 - Vendor showed 2 (sets of 2 chairs) in stock. Vendor contacted me they didn't have them and didn't know when they will be in. I am disappointed. I have these chairs already and want to add 2 more. I do not want to purchase a new table and chairs. Thinking about cancelling the order is I don't hear from vendor by the end of March.
4,Big bang for the buck,"What a great looking boot for an unbelievable price. The boot is comfortable, but just a little snug towards the front. Easy to get on and off."
5,Can't live without it...,"Truly gives one confidence to jump in and start creating. Lessons easy to follow. And I hate manuals. Who can get past the first ten pages. As a new MAC user (finally, finally, gave up on a PC) needed a jump start and DMTS provides it. Would not hesitate to buy another of their products."
2,This book was confusing.,"This book was used for my business information systems class. I did not think that it was set up in a organized manner. A number of topics were discussed in chapter after chapter, while others were barely touched on. Other topics were brought up, only to mention that they would be dicussed in later chapters. The illustrations, for the most part, were clear enough to understand and were colorful. I would not recommend that this book be used for an information systems class."
3,The book was very hard to follow,"Introduction to Information Systems: An Internetworked Enterprise Perspective by James A. O'Brien was the required text for my Business Information Systems class. This text was very difficult to understand. O'Brien touched on many good details, but he seemed to be very repetitive at the same time. He did not go into detail enough on certain points. He would mention a topic and then move on to something new. Also, the graphics and tables made things worse. They were good, but very hard to comprehend. Graphics should be something that would complement the text not complicate the matter. Compared to other classes, this text ranks below others used. It does, however, use the end of the chapter reviews like other texts. This helps the student prepare for upcoming tests. I believe that another text could have been more valuable if it had been used for this type of class."
3,This book meets the criteria of the class well.,"Introduction to Information Systems: An Internetworked Enterprise Perspective by James A. O'Brien was the required text for my Business Information Systems class. This is a good text for the course. It covers necessary course requirements. There is good use of color throughout the entire book. There is good use of charts and graphs. This makes the information more relevant. The Real World Cases make it more applicable. The chapters are arranged into sections which brings about a more organized appearance. The difficult concepts were explained, but at times, more explanations would have been helpful. This text could be compared at about equal with my other textbooks. This book has made me realize that there is more depth to my career choice than I had realized."
2,"This book is well organized, but the substance is lacking","The organization of this book is very good, and very understandable. The way the author organized the main concepts and backed them up with real-world examples is commendable. However, there is a problem with the book's content. The main concepts are presented in such a way as to assume the reader had previously been taught what they were. I am presently taking a class with this textbook, and it took three chapters before I finally grasped the idea of what an information system really was! The definitions are sparse, and the language too haughty and technical for students whose main focus is not business management or computers."
2,not one of my favorits,"in this book every single sentence is a long,I mean very long, definition.The amount of information pressed into each single chapter is amazing. THis book claims to be an introduction to information systems, I have some backround information and still have trouble to understand this text. I would definitely not recomend this book. Please pick something else, and there are many better books out there."
4,Book came in great shape,Thank you for the book. I got it and it is good to go.I am looking forward to using it for the class next week.
1,wrong book,"you sent the wrong book, and it was damaged! im not happy at all, and I wont be buying anything from here again."
3,Not the picture cover I ordered,The cover of the book shown is the edition i thought i was getting. I got an older edition.
5,"wonderful,comprehensive,compassionate,focussing,educational.","I worked in a health library for years, & this was our most valued & dog-eared reference book. For those lay-people who feel like despairing over the lack of information available on their particular condition (rare or not), this book will provide them with references to support groups, ways to form their own support group, & suggestions for dealing with life-altering conditions."
1,Don't order this!!!,"Not only is Kidde an ultra cheapie brand, but when I received mine, the dial showed that it needed recharging! Needs recharging???? A brand new one???? Since it wasn't even worth the hassle of returning it, I ended up tossing this piece of junk and driving to a local fire equipment place that sold the only brand I would ever consider buying from this point forward...Amarex. Amarex fire extinguishers are the best, they are made in the USA, and they come with a sturdy metal mounting bracket, unlike the Kidde that comes with a total piece of junk plastic bracket (what a joke). Plus, Kidde extinguishers are made south of the border. Do yourself a favor and get Amarex! It is the only way to go. I bought two for my boat, and it is a good feeling knowing that I have the best fire extinguishers available."
3,The beginning....,"I thought this CD was worth the 12 bucks. It's not as polished as his subsequent works but makes for a good country/blues/rock listen. If you a dedicated fan like I am, I think you will also like it."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"It is interesting to compare the differences, particularly when they are talking about early SF, for example, between the Clute encyclopedia and this one. This is also worth a look, but it is much more focused on video, in general, but does give an author list with bios, and a 'heroes/villains/characters' list, which is fun, indeed."
3,Energizer Battery Phone Charger Pack,I bought this to power my older Nokia Phone during an emergency or power outage. A few points:1) Rechargeable batteries do not work in this product2) It is highly recommended to get lithium batteries to power this product both Duracell and Energizer have this type of battery but they charge a premium for them.I thought about building this device before I bought this one. I will probably build a better one then this so that I can use rechargeable batteries. Radio Shack here I come.
4,"MOVE OVER DIANA K...& JOURNEY'S ""LIGHTS""","DELIGHTFUL IS THE ONLY WORD THAT COMES TO MIND ONCE I LISTENED TO THIS LIVE RENDITION OF JACQUI NAYLOR'S NEWEST OFFERING. LOVELY IMAGES OF SAN FRANCISCO AND NIGHTS IN THE 39-MAIN OF TIBURON LISTENING TO JOURNEY'S ""LIGHTS"" AND LOOKING UPON THE BEST CITY VIEW IN TOWN..UNTIL NOW. IF ONLY JACQUI RECORDED ""CITY BY THE BAY"" BACK THEN? WOULD A DIFFERENT FEELING PREVAIL IN OUR TOWN THAT HAS LOST IT'S SOUL? MAYBE? BUT GIVE ME SOME OF THAT ""BLACK COFFEE"" TURN ON ""BIRDLAND"" EAST & YOSHI'S WEST AND OFF WE GO INTO AN AMAZING WORLD OF INTERESTING SOUNDS FILLED WITH FABULOUS ARRANGEMENTS WITH FEELINGS OF PROGRESSIVE JAZZ TO OLD ROCK ""STANDARDS"" TO ELOQUENT BALLADS. A MUST CD FOR ALL YOU ROMANTICS OUT THERE.THANKS FOR NOT SELLING OUT GUYS AND GALS AND BRING US MORE..MORE MORE...ERICK V"
5,Not one of his best?...not true,"I don't know what kind of methodology Gene Friedman (the other reviewer) used when coming to his conclusion, but this recording actually is one of Carter's best. The track ""Einbahnstrasse"" captures Herbie Hancock ablaze, with Billy Cobham battering it out on drums. In addition to being an essential Ron Carter recording to own, it is easily one of the better hard bop albums out there. All seven tracks are originals by Carter, with alternate takes of ""Einbahnstrasse"" and ""Doom."" This probably is Ron's best!Highly recommended"
1,Cheap Microphone,Watch out. The reviews that I had read before buying this product claimed that it came with a Plantronics DSP-300 stereo headset microphone but when I recieved it a cheap Andrea NC-61 was included. I paid the extra money believing I would recieve a quality microphone. For this reason alone I gave it a one star rating. I returned the product for a refund.
5,Living With Zen,Living with Zen is more than home design. Every room is detailed. Living with less and being in harmony with ones surroundings is the general theme of this book.
1,How to overstate EVERYTHING for 3 hours...,"The Trial of BJ is possibly the most pretentious, preachy and embarrassingly icky film I've ever endured. I admit I kind of liked Billy Jack (the movie), but this unfathomably long egomaniacle kick to the teeth is not worth wasting the media on which it is saved.This is a review of the VHS version."
1,"This may be up there with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""..","Simply put, it mega sucks, and here's why:1. No coherent plot line, leftist drivel throughout, it's kinda like a serious, yet very disjointed ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh In"" type series of sketches.2. The acting in this is horrible. Tom Laughlin is passable, at best, as an actor. His wife, Delores Taylor, to be charitable, has neither passable acting skills nor a charismatic appearance. You'll note that she hasn't starred in a lot of movies sans the Billy Jack series.3. There's a young blond haired woman who can't really sing but who sings throughout this nonetheless, a balding doctor character who's passable from an acting standpoint, and some good scenic shots. In fact, the best thing about this entire movie is the scenery. And little else.In closing, if someone calls you and offers you a chance to see ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" free of charge, ask them what you did to offend them. Then find something else to watch."
2,Long and Pretentious Movie,"Unlike the first movie, which at times preachy, but still entertaining, this movie by Tom Laughlin and Delores Taylor is very long and very pretentious. The movie starts out long by tracking the trial of Billy Jack (hence the name)that does not resemble much of a real trial at all. It is only a format for Tom Laughlin to spot many of his esoteric views.The next chapter of the film is notoriously long as the character Jean (Taylor) continnues to recounts events from a hospital bed about the kids at the ""school"" and the local evil rich people. This movie is just too preachy and it never bothers to examine some of their (school) prejudges and uncivil behavior.The only redeeming value is that Tom Laughlin still brings out a ""Billy Jack"" persona. Tom is Billy jack, and is convincing in the role he was made for. The fght scenes, with Hapikido Master Bong Soo Han are, for its time, very good and still worth watching."
2,NOT LETTERBOXED!!,"I really enjoy the BILLY JACK movies and my review would carry a much higher rating if this Panavision film was properly letterboxed! TRIAL OF BJ and IN WASHINGTON were both shot in Panavision....IN WASHINGTON is letterboxed appropriately at 2.35:1, but TRIAL is pan & scan(full screen)--the viewer is missing a significant amount of the filmed frame!!This is just a warning to folks such as myself who like to see movies the way they were meant to be seen, with the compositions unspoiled! This is the only DVD in the set that opens with the Warner Brothers logo, so it is possible that this old Warner transfer is the only thing they had available for the production of this title--but it's too bad that the opportunity was missed to see this classic the way it was originally filmed!"
2,Runs very large,I purchased a med. and it was like a xl. I sending them back. I thought they would be better quality.
4,Gildan Sweat Pant,"Great pant, but it needs pockets. Good value, and nice fit. Very satisfied with this product. They go very well with the shirt."
3,Nicely made,"These seem well made, although, having had them only a few months, I am unable to comment on longevity. After half a dozen washings they are totally intact. I subtract a Star for the fact that they have no pockets, and another Star for the fact they are not made in the USA."
2,Caller ID,"Second Vtech with caller ID problem. Half the time, the caller ID shows ""incoming call."" Nothing more. In general, I have had problems with Vtech."
1,Piece of Junk,"Within a few months of my purchase, the buttons on the keypad start to fail. Nothing happens when I press the ""off/clear"" button, and on the accessory handset I bought, the ""memory"" soft button has the same problem.Both phones are currently have serious keypad problems, very annoying.I will definitely steer clear of Vtech phones in the future."
2,Can only use this phone indoors,"My biggest disappointment with this phone is that you cannot take it outside of the house. I live in a very small house and as soon as I step outside with this phone, it is unable to locate the base. Waste of money."
2,v- NO TECH,The main complaint is that the two handhelds i have dont work farther than 30 ft. from the base station. TS
1,Can't really be this bad,This phone really can't be this bad. This is absolutely the worst phone I have ever used. It is worse then a cell phone in an area with poor reception.The battery cover is loose and feels like it is going to fall off. There is a constant echo on this phone and it has disconnected me 3 times in one week.I am returning this phone for an exchange to see if maybe it is just this specific phone.
1,"One of the worst ""mysteries"" I've ever read!","Because I've enjoyed previous Higgins Clarks' Alvirah and Willy mysteries and was about embark on a cruise in Hawaii, I thought this book would be perfect! Was I wrong!! It has a paper thin plot, if any, and even the usual cast of characters is weakly drawn. It's almost as if it were given as a class assignment - ""Write a novel in the Mary Higgins Clark/Carol Higgins Clark STYLE."" It was awful! One redeeming feature - the authors did their homework about cruises - all the details were there - passenger photos with the captain, food, etc., it clicked in that way. But the plot was downright silly! Can you imagine Alvirah being able to swim all the way around a 400-passenger ship and then catch a box in her hand? PLEASE do not buy this book, especially at full price as I did, thinking it would be just right for my cruise experience. I wanted to throw it overboard!"
1,Fluff!,"I had to listen to this book on CD as I drove to various locations during Christmas. The characters are all 1 dimensional and the plot goes no where. It has to be one of the worst books I have ever listened to. Don't waste your time! If I could give no stars, I would."
2,Dissapponted Fan,"I am a huge fan Of MHC. Her last book ""The little girls in blue"" was a real page turner. I was hoping that quality that MCH has would overshadow CHC. I did not. I won't buy another book with CHC on it again. I really think CHC should think of writing children's books, she might be better suited for it."
2,Not much to this.,"I wonder if the collaborative efforts between mother and daughter wane. This really wasn't much fun at all. Quick read, and that's the best part about it."
2,Predictable,I have read most of Mary Higgins Clark's book and some of the collaborations. I thought this was strictly formula writing. There was no depth to the characters - I did not make a connection with any of them. It is a quick read but only because I wanted to finish it so I could start a good book.
1,Worst of the Bunch,"Sad to say, but the Clark duo didn't come through this time (or last, with The Christmas Thief). It seems to have been written in a hurry, with poor editing also. Two-dimensional characters, predictable and many times absurd plot and sub-plot, and silly rather than funny moments.Mary Higgins Clark's earlier books were far better, and the earlier mother-daughter Christmas-themed books were somewhat better, too."
3,not good or bad,"This book was just okay. It's a cute little mystery, but it does not have anywhere enough of the main characters we've grown to love. The good thing is that there is very little blood and gore, but the plot is a little bizarre. I would get it from the library, before I would pay full price for it."
3,Eh,I wasn't really impressed. It came quickly but the shade was wayyyy to light. Besides that it came fast and was the prduct advertised.
4,Good Poetry,"""Aureoles"" is a mini-chapbook, a physically small collection of eight poems. But there is nothing small-minded about the author's work. Fasel uses her words sparingly, but communicates a great deal. My favorite in the collection is ""Bonsai,"" which in just five lines explores how, when something is forced to fit an unnatural form in the name of art, it can sometimes be drained of life."
