2,"This is another ""Knockout"" movie....","..as in similar to the movie ""Knockout"" and not really a great boxing movie. It's more of a cute girl doing boxing. Erika Eleniak looks to be in great shape for the movie. It's too bad the script is really boring that you can't get more into it. Even with Erika in great shape, she's no boxer which becomes quite apparent during her training and fight sequences. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. As always, they choose a real female boxer as an opponent but don't spend enough time training the star to complement the adversary. About the only good refreshing thing about this movie was the coach and his gym. It was interesting to see a young coach and his bviews about boxing and training. Don't know if that's enough to carry this movie for some. It wasn't for me. Nope, definitely can't recommend this movie unless it goes to deep discount, and you're just bored at 12 AM."
1,Service Nightmare's,"I admit that there is a lot to like about the design of this grill. Based on design alone, the poor rating may not be fair. Unfortunately I am so angry at the non-existent service that they get a ""one"" rating. I'll keep it short by STRONGLY suggesting that you find out where the warranty service will come from before you buy a Weber product. My grill had problems after only two months. The service people were over 3 hours away and had NO interest whatsoever in coming to fix my grill. Phone calls, e-mails and even snail mail to the President of Weber failed to illicit ANY reponse. I couldn't be more dissapointed in Weber. I paid nearly $700 for this grill and can't get it repaired."
4,Difficult to Assemble!,"It's a great grill, but . . .It seems like the people who wrote the assembly instructions played with legos as children. ""Hey, we can make our assembly instructions all pictures just like legos!"" Apparently, it is not that easy.Clearly the instructions were not tested on real people. Most of the pictures make no sense at all. The rest make sense only after you have stared at the picture for several minutes. Many pictures don't apply to the e-310 at all. They apply to the e-320, but there are no words to tell you this. No words at all. Just a bunch of vague pictures . . ."
4,I'm impressed.,"My Brinkmann Pro 2400 died and since the parts are on almost permanent back-order it was time for a new grill. I am so glad I went with the Weber! The intructions were simple & easy to follow and all the holes line up making assembly a snap. This grill is solid, the frame is welded tube steel. With the 3 stainless burners this grill quickly reaches 600 degrees and the porcelain coated cast iron grill surface sears nicely. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the control knobs on the right shelf - otherwise I really like this grill!"
5,Well Worth the Price,"This is my third Weber grill and this one is the best by far. I found this in Copper at Home Expo after seeing it in House Beautiful and love the color. The work surface on past grills has been skimpy, a problem corrected with the Genesis E-310. The unsightly propane tank is enclosed and there's plenty of storage space. Everything is accessible for easy cleaning. Everything I've cooked on this grill has come out perfectly. And don't forget to get the Weber cover to protect your grill."
5,not enough stars,"This thing is boss! No complaints at all. Gets hot quick, even heat no cold spots. Heavy duty materials, grates and components are of great quality. It is also VERY easy to clean. The flavorizer bars come right out and the large catch pan slides out for easy cleaning. Temperature control is spot on just adjust your knobs and it locks in a steady temperature. Ive done steaks, burgers, chicken, fish, and even veggies for a roasted veggie salsa. This grill is truly a pleasure to use and is well worth the price tag. Everyone knows how well webers are built and the e 310 is no exception!"
5,Phenomenol!,"I recently ran across this book in my local grocery store and decided to try it out. I love, love, love this book! I can't put it down. I can't read my other books because I keep picking this one up. I carry it in my purse, my overnight bag and keep it in my car in case I'm stopped somewhere and need something to read. This book speaks plainly and clearly and every time I think I've completed a section, I go back and read it again. If anyone was ever in doubt about how to strengthen his/her relationship with God and how to claim the power he/she has already been given by God, this is the book to read. Stop speaking false confessions, stop claiming what is not yours and receive what God has waiting for you."
5,A great Commentary on Daniel,"I have read some of Walvoord's other books and found him t be thorough. My wife and I have been studying Daniel, Matthew 24-25 and Reveltion for a few years now, along with reading the Bible each year. To get a more thourough understanding of Revelation, you should understand Daniel and Matthew 24-25. To this end it has been a great book. If you want to know all the various philosophies of both conservative and liberal Christians, it is a great book. He tells you what all these various people think then gives you his conclusions. So far I have found his thought process to be right on."
1,My the pain go away,"Lord, this is by far the worst book ever written since...well, since...since the creation of the universe. It makes no sense what so ever, the characters are laughable, the action scenes completely stupid - the while thing is just unbelievable. It is beyond belief that this was even published. I actually threw it in th garbage; this was a first for me. I truly feared that this book would contaminate the other books in my shelves. STAY AWAY from this at all cost, treat it like anthrax or somehting as equally nasty or dangerous."
2,disappointed..,"after listening to the genesis album and hearing his single with mariah carey, i was really excited to get this album....but now i've heard it...i have to say - i'm disappointed. perhaps it's coz i aint been a fan 'from the beginning' but i only REALLY LIKE two tracks on here: 'i know what you want' and 'together'...8.99 for the two tracks? oh well...i suppose the TWO songs are worth it...:-S"
5,Rap album of the year??/,"This album is a rare gym. It provides tight tracks, great lyrics and creates a nice party mood. There are few albums that do this well. Most often, you have to chose between good lyrics and party music.Busta continues to grow as an artist and creates a very memorable album. There are a lot of artist that need to analyze this disk."
2,"Great restoration, weak film","I'm not a movie buff, so I'm not as enamored of this as some. Taken strictly on its merits, it's an old-fashioned sci-fi '50s style, with extremely wooden acting, ridiculous costumes and a troubling religious bent. Even so, the Technicolor restoration is awesome. Details are crystal clear. You feel transported back to 1952 LA in some scenes. The acting leads are pretty bad. In fact, there is no good acting here at all. The special effects are ok, by 1952 standards, I guess. They used the same look of the Martians for the newer Tom Cruise remake. The end is abrupt and somewhat unsatisfying. At one point, they drop an atom bomb on California while people watch like a Nascar race. Absurd, considering that radiation poisoning was well known then, seven years after Hiroshima. The rubes who discover the space ship are just dumb, annoyingly so."
4,An affordable collector's item...,"The VHS version of this movie is well worth owning. Considering the age of the movie and the great advancement in special effects, the aliens were still credible. If only that woman would stop screaming!!!!"
4,One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever...,"Oscar winner of the Best Speical effects, this 1952 film adaptation of Wells' novel delivers lots of thrills, battle scenes, a atomic bomb attack and Ann Robinson screaming her head off. The tripods from the book have been replaced with swan-shaped warmachines with invisible legs and protective force fields.I just wish that the film was longer, as it is only 85 minutes long, and that they had tried to update the story, giving it a better ending.The DVD has few extras. Buy the video if you don't need to see the movie in French."
5,A Classic Among Classics,"What can I say? The original ""War of the Worlds"" film was perfect. It followed the book well along with being a good creeper movie. A definite must watch for any sci-fi fan."
4,Far superior to the new War of the Worlds release of 2005,"Ann Robinson's screaming might have been a bit much, but past that, the movie leaves an indelible impression. The story, the acting, the special effects, both visual and in sound, make for a believable and frightening Martian invasion, which lacks in the newer 2005 version. Hooray for 1952 special effects. For they are still special 53 years later."
4,They have invaded our World and in a Non-Friendly Manor,"the Earth is a dangerous world, but outside of it is even more dangerous when mankind and extraterrestrials collide in a war between worlds. Before ID4, the original invasion was ""The War of the Worlds"" this 1953 sc-fi thriller based on H.G. Wells' 1898 novel is still today a action packed blast and great classic film for sc-fi fans, it's imaginative hollywood filmmaking,a fun filled cyber slam, the visual effects are pretty good for 1953 from the eyes of 21st century person. I recommend this classic thriller for sc-fi fans. It will still blow you away, away and out of this world. So bring this classic to your world and enjoy the original war between the earthlings and the martians."
4,The War of the Worlds (1953),"Overlooked because it came out two years following the release of The Day the Earth Stood Still and three years preceding the release of both Forbidden Planet and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, this film adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novella (which would be remade several times--three in 2005, including Spielberg's version with Tom Cruise) is one of the better films to come out of the '50s, specifically in the sci-fi genre. It won an Academy Award for its special effects achievements, which, despite looking dated and hokey now, were unprecedented in 1953; and was a cornerstone in igniting Hollywood's spontaneous blast of enthusiasm for science-fiction pictures."
3,Here is a story begging for a remake,"If you like cheesie ""classics"", this is for you. But the book is filled with richly described, hair-raising scenes that this movie lacks. Why can't Merchant & Ivory team up with ILM special effects and really do this story right!"
5,War of The Worlds,Hi I think this is a great movie and have always loved it seen it in 1954 and saw it 3 times then...It is hard to beat old movies..
4,Top-rate adaptation of H.G. Well's novel,"Without the paranoia typical of this period, this classical adventure on the theme of the alien invasion is remarkable by its special effects (the streamlined swan shape alien vehicle). Bonus for this DVD edition : an excellent remasterisation with a perfect balance of colours and almost no artefact (except two large shots of crowd in the hills of LA)"
5,A timeless classic,I tend to buy the older sci fi movies such as this one.I was really upset that people were gouging buyers for the film when it was oop.I thought it was very greedy for people to do that.I myself sell movies on amazon and dont do this.I sell them at an affordable price so anyone can afford them.The movie is a masterpeice of film making.I realize the special effects are a bit dated but it was made in the fifties and cgi wasnt even thought about as there were no usable computers at that time to produce such special effects.I have been waiting for quite awhile and im glad i had the patience to wait for the release of it.The price is dirt cheap and i highly recomend this fine film.
4,The War of the Worlds,"This is the best version, the newer makes have better special effects, however, they are over the top and take the real magic away."
1,WAR OF THE WORLDS,"WE PLAYED THE DVD AND IT WOULD STOP IN THE SAME PLACE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WE EVEN TRIED TO PLAY IT IN ANOTHER PLAYER AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK. WHEN WE TRIED TO RETURN IT, WE WERE ASKED TO FILL OUT A QUESTIONAIRE THAT MADE US FEEL LIKE WE WERE CROOKS AND TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING.I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. WE ASKED FOR A NEW DVD INSTEAD OF A CREDIT TO OUR ACCOUNT BUT WE RECEIVED THE CREDIT INSTEAD OF A NEW DVD."
2,Should not be ranked with the best,"This George Pal treatment of the H.G.Well's classic masterpiece is poor in deed. The FX for the time is great but the story and plot are such stinkers the film simply fails. It is cold war updated and I am sure to the dismay of Wells full of religious overtones which added nothing to the story. To have this poor thing rated with Sci-F masterpieces such as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""2001"" is a sham and an injustice."
5,shocked at prices,I can't believe how expensive this is...I found it on DVD for under 15.00 at Movies Unlimited..and its new too. Good quality DVD.
3,I wish this was more like the book.,"As a child around 1960, I saw a black and white version of this movie that took place in England. I've been looking for a copy of it ever since. It was truer to the book and made a greater impression on me. I'd be curious if anyone else saw that version."
5,Truly Ahead of It's Time!,"When this movie was made, it was truly way ahead of its time! The characters do a good job. The special effects were also really good for an older movie. I really enjoyed this!"
4,A film with few peers,"The aliens are coming! And in this handsome production of the H.G. Wells novel, age has not diminished the impact of these deadly, serpentine things from Mars. What starts with a ""meteor"" crashing into a mountain evolves into a story that offers both suspense and a few observations about mankind. George Pal's special effects are still dazzling, though you have to forgive the occasionally visible prop strings. The dialogue is, at times, stilted (""I could just blow my head off,"" the heroine exclaims at one point), but otherwise, this gem holds its own with today's fare and is a must for any sci-fi fan. Too bad the DVD doesn't come in widescreen."
1,Go Away,Nothing note worthy. A movie worth missing. Once you watch there is no motivation to watch again. Out of 5 stars I give it one. It was made afterall.
4,I want more!,I gave this a 4 rather than a 5 because it was too short. This would have made a great (longe) movie or even better a web series. I want more!
2,Movie over before it had a start,Movie could have had potential but it was very vague and short. Why would one just wait around for someone else eho was justt to park car?? was just so vague.
2,short,to short thought there would be more and will read before i order another movie at a 1.99. I wish I knew how to delete it off my page
1,An inadequate compilation.,"This camera catalog is essentially useless unless one is interested only in basic camera prices and basic cameras. Any camera catalog that contains information about single lens reflex cameras but excludes technical and price information about accessory lenses for those cameras, as this one does, might just as well not exist."
1,Looks like an Old Xerox,I don't know what they put in this ink but your copies come out looking like xeroxes from a VERY old machine. Everything is fuzzy. I had to bump the type size up from 10 to 12 to make it good enough to send out. You don't save that much to have print this bad. Not recommended.
1,Slowly drives you crazy...,"When you helplessly watching the rats eating your stock of steel and brick in your warehouse, and your citizens going to commit revolution because they don't have enough chocolade or tobaco or perfume, you feel like you slowly loosing your mind. This stupid game, wroten by some mentaly seek idiots, helps you to find the shortest way to mental house. I wouldn't even list all nonsenses in this game, because it's nothing but the pack of such senseless nonsenses. Besides, you gotta switch almost all video effects off (unless you have some $10000 machine with the dedicated power plant to feed it), otherwise the game will be converted to plain slideshow... Enjoy!.....Folks, don't waste your time, money and shape on such garbage. Buy ""Port Royale 2"" and enjoy real beauty and smartness."
5,Don't miss this gem ...,"Being in the unenviable position of following the mega-successful Autobahn,and preceding the acclaimed masterwork that is Tran-Europe Express,this release is often overlooked.Mores the pity,because I find Radio-Activity to be their most cohesive and ambitious release.I imagine that those who were looking for another radio-friendly zinger like Autobahn were a bit put off by the ""blip and bleep symphony"" that confronted them.But this is a work that reveals a new dimension with every listen.Movements{I'm thinking in symphonic terms}such as Airwaves and Ohm Sweet Ohm are immediately appealing,and could have possibly been ""hits"" if they had been pushed as such.Bottom line?This is not an album that you throw on for a casual listen.This release,more so than any other KW recording,demands your complete attention.Trust me,you will not be disappointed.I have returned to it again and again over the years...and I always discover something new."
4,Paramount hasn't done justice to BLACK RAIN !,"I really enjoyed this when I watched it back at the cinema in 1989.Last year I found out that it was available on dvd and made the purchase without prior knowledge of the picture quality.The film still impresses me but I am very much disappointed with the picture quality,which is grainy and has fading color. It's a pity Paramount has overlooked this film.I am looking forward to seeing a SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION release which includes:an anamorphic widescreen transfer,a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound,English subtitle(the current one doesn't even have this standard feature!),audio commentary with Ridley Scott and/or Michael Douglas,interviews,or other featurettes of the film. What do you say PARAMOUNT ?"
4,great cop drama holds up over time....,one of the few early cop classics out of this decade that still holds up over time. Music is not too kitchy and the dialogue contains a few memorable lines. Als stars a younger Andy Garcia. First 10 minutes or so starts out pretty mundane but it then settles into an investigative drama. Its mildy superficial but not overly so for this time period.
3,Not Masterpiece,"There are some really good songs, but his real masterpieces are completely left out of this CD. Some songs are downright boring."
4,Dog of Flanders,"Borrowed this from the Libary and enjoyed it so decided to add it to my collection, it is a great movie"
5,It sword of grows on you .,"I was scrolling through my channel guide but then I stopped at HBO thinking it was just weird I passed it about 4 minutes later I thought I have too at least watch it one time I only saw the ending of it but that was good ,so at 12:00 I went too HBO west that time I only saw the scene where Nello and Alosie woke up at the circus ,after her father forbidden too let her see Nello ever again Alosie had only one memory the pitcure that week Nello gave Alosie a puppet . That night the barn caught on fire , everyone in the town blamed Nello for the causing of the inferno . Alosie's father broke Alosie's puppet then went back inside. Enough with the story but on the scale of 1 too 10 I would give it a perfect 10 !"
1,A crappy version of the old movie,"This newer remake of the film is the worst. They made the main character whiney and ungrateful, as well as (strangely) suicidal. Don't waste your time or money. If you want this movie, buy the original. It may be older but it is far better and will probably teach your child better lessons than this garbage."
1,Made us sick too,I ordered these for my family and we had them as a snack only to have us all come down sick within a few hours. It was very painful and my 4 yr old spent the night vomiting. We know it was these since no one ate any dinner that day and lunch and breakfast had been different for everyone. It was no fun to be 9 months pregnant and have a family of 6 be sick all night.
1,These made me very sick,"Well, I'll keep this short and to the point. As other reviewers have stated, these do a number on my digestive system. I'm currently very ill after eating a handful of these. They're also a lot tougher than normal gummy bears, so they hurt my jaw to chew. I don't recommend buying these."
2,"They taste great, but the taste isn't all that you get!","Wow, eat a few and you're fine. Eat a half of handful and you'll be ""popping"" in a few hours. Eat a handful or more and you better stay near a bathroom for the rest of the day. These taste great just like the regular ones, but they'll affect you in more ways than one ;)."
1,Why didn't I read the reviews first!,"OMG CAUTION! I should have read the reviews before munching down handfuls! A moment on the lips...and 24 hours later, the stomach pain is still equivalent to being stabbed! The only comparison I could draw to the effects would be eating a dodgy vindaloo!"
1,Bad stomach ache and diarrhea!,"Be forewarned! These gummy bears are tasty, but if you eat more than a couple at a time, you will get a bad tummy ache and diarrhea. On top of that, there are no nutritional information available, so who knows whether they are actually completely sugar free, and I also wonder about the carbohydrate content. Even my friend who is diabetic would not eat them because he said he would rather eat nothing than suffer with stomach cramps. I seriously only had a handful, and then about 2 hrs later, I got a terrible stomach ache and diarhea. I ended up throwing away the whole bag! What a waste of money!"
2,Call Me Gassy!!!,"I got this 4 days ago and have had nothing but build ups of gas....very painful! The taste was okay for sugar free, but the trade off is so not worth it. I gave a bag to a friend and he is experiencing the same symptom with heart burn on top of it."
1,disrespectful packing of the shipped product,"This product came in with an Imagine lumin disk in one box.Those 2 items apparently did not fit on a box, therefore the seller ripped the candy package apart by cutting the top of the package and spreading the candy loose all over the lamp.When we opened the package, the candy was stuck to the lamp, and the rest of the package fell off the box.All the candy went onto the floor since they were just ""dumped"" into the box.The candy was not eatable, came dirty and basically someone used it as padding for the lamp.I anticipate that the seller resends the box of haribo in a clean and good condition without opening the package to make the product fit in the cheapest box to shipPlease respond asap"
3,well...,"i got this for my 3 year old son, only six of them gave him terrible gas and horrible diarrhea, the next day I ate some and the same thing happened to me, they taste great but GAS IS NOT SEXY PEOPLE!!!!"
1,Gastrointestinal Armageddon,"When I got these, I couldn't contain my excitement and I ate about a quarter of a bag. Scenes from the movie 2012 could have been filmed inside my gut. There would have been less pressure to make two winning free throws in the NBA finals than for gas to escape my bowels. After a few hours, I had an EXTREME build-up of gas with no relief. All I could do was lie on my bed and pray for a fart. That might sound funny, but when you've eaten something that has basically turned you into the blueberry girl from Willy Wonka, you're pleading for relief. Well, the farts came and I lived through it but I not only had a visit from the fart fairy, but the sales rep from Montezuma's Revenge stopped by and gave me a FULL demo of their services as well.In retrospect, eating over a pound all at once wasn't the brightest thing I've done (but it also wasn't the dimmest). If I go back and finish the bag off, I'll probably leave a suicide note."
2,Great taste! Horrible Stomach issues,"These taste really good and I couldn't even tell the difference between the regular and these sugarless. I don't know what they use as a substitute (mine came without any ingredients listed) but whatever it is gives you really really bad gas, and sometimes diarrhea.It was very painful too.I tried eating them twice and both times the same results. The Gas i have to say is the worse of the two, it lasts for hours and hours and it's extremely embarrassing. I would not buy these again."
1,Flu symptoms in a bag,"If you want the syptoms of the flu, like severe gas, stomache ache, stomache gurgling, having the runs every 10 minutes, then this is the product for you. You will feel like you are making part two of Dumb and Dumber, when Jeff Daniels sat on the toilet making severe gas and splashing noises after being fed laxitves. Only you can't stop when the scene is over, this will last two to three days."
1,Yuck!,"I too had severe stomach reaction to these. The flavor is poor, hardly any flavor at all. They are so hard you can chew them w/o risking damage to dental work. I can imagine anyone wanting these.. I gave them all away at work rather than just tossing them in the garbage. DONT WASTE YOU MONEY THEY ARE AWFUL ALL THE WAY AROUND."
1,horrible,"Actually no stars. Very good price for 5 pounds, but that's where the good news stops. The taste just sucks. Not sweet at all, more like sour but not a very strong flavor, just weak. The sugar free gummi bears from Jelly Belly (no, I'm not a corporate wanker) cost considerably more but taste much better. Total waste of my money, went directly into the trash. Just saying........."
5,sugar free products,"I love Haribo gummy bears. I was always eating them as a kid. Now that I am an adult I still love them, but can only have sugar free ones. WARNING if you are not familiar with sugar alcohols then you need to eat sugar free products slowly. They do cause some intestinal discomfort. I find like with everything else be smart eat in moderation. I can eat some sugar free products and they don't bother me, but others do. Be smart read reviews and follow advice from those who have tried them. I have been living low carb and sugar free for ten years"
1,EEEEEHOLAAAAAAY,I sat down and ate about 100 of these while working on my computer. Ha ha about 3 hrs later we are talking forced Bulimia out the other end. Hey on the bright side it may help dieting - Nothing and I mean Nothing will stay on the inside. Makes you wonder how the FDA can allow this to happen !! Also why is Amazon selling this product.
1,Toxic Gummi Bears,The sugar substitute used is a laxative and caused everyone who ate them to become very sick
1,Major stomach upset - don't buy!!!!!,If u buy these gummy bears u will be running to the toilet!! O could not figure out why I had such stomach issues and gas until my family started to have the same problems! I then went on to read the amazon reviews and my suspicions were confirmed! They taste great but u will pay! Not sure why amazon still has these on the shelf with All the bad reviews.
3,The best Gummy Bears Ever,"As far as the product is concerned, it has the greatest taste and well worth the money. However the reason for the low rating is that you can only buy the sugar free Bears in a 5 pound bag. It is a lot of product for on person to eat and if you are trying to watch calories it is hard when you have a bag of these great Haribo Gummy bears. I have been eating them for decates at the flavor is just as great as the regular Bears."
2,Is'nt it better to burn out than fade away?,"As a long-time (25 years) fan of Neil Young, I must say that he should follow his own advise. After listening to this CD a few times, I thought I was going to need CPR to revive me. This collection is as mellow as Harvest Moon, but fortunately not as melancholy. On a Neil Young scale of 1-10 this is a 1 or 2. But compared with most music being released these days, it is still a 9 or 10. Somebody please wake me for his next release."
2,Who is this and what did they do with the real Neil?,"As a hard-core Neil Young fan since my freshman days at college when 4-Way Street was popular, I must admit that Neil has suprised me once again. One of the great things about anticipating a new Neil Young album (CD) is that you never know what you'll be listening to when you get it home. Unfortunately, this reminds me too much of Harvest Moon, a snoozer. Better luck next time. I have listened through it 3-4 times now and its not getting any better, unlike most of his work. Maybe this is the ""kinder and gentler"" Neil. For me, I'm still waiting for the next ""Live Rust"". I remain a true fan, but this one will go to the bottom of the large pile of Neil works in my stereo closet."
4,A pleasant return to his 70s sound,"What once was lost, now is found/Amazing grace? Probably. Perhaps catalyzed by the ""Unplugged"" experience?I doubt there is anything that will prove to be as memorable on this sweet and relaxed album of this aged (but not old!) master as on his first solo albums, or the songs he wrote as part of Buffalo Springfield (dimly but unbitterly remembered in a cut here). I am not convinced that Young has returned to the vein of ore he mined earlier, but even if he is only sifting through tailings, there is still some shining stuff left there. That is, this is a welcome supplement to the nostalgia of the revisited prime Young of the 70s that ""Unplugged"" reminded us of. The sound is here. Even if, as I think, the substance is less, there is subtance--new substance even."
2,Everybody knows this is Nowhere,"Another Neil Young album. Well you just have to buy it don't you because it is NEIL. Well yes but I wished that I had not. The songs have no real bite, some of them are older than my kids and the album is short, but not sweet. Where have all the cowboys gone asked Paula Cole. Perhaps Neil should have called this one Treading Water."
3,Standard Fare For Young,"""Silver + Gold"" contains Neil Young's basic song setups from years past. Speckled with innocuous, repititous lyrics, there are few surprises. However, there are some true stand-out tracks. ""The Great Divide"" and ""Buffalo Springfield"" are inventive upbeat tracks, the latter a song lamenting about Neil Young's late sixties rock band. ""Horseshoe Man"" is a heart-breaking ballad, one of Young's best. The remaining songs seems like Neil Young 'rehash', but it's not that bad. Thanks to veteran drummer Jim Keltner, the songs contain fresh beats, but unfortunately, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt are sorely underused as backup singers. Not much new, but still good Neil Young magic."
5,My son lost his and now he has it.,It was a good price and the CD was just what my son wanted. All CDs came in great condition and great to get them quickly.
3,Basic model with limited functionality,"The model met all my expectations for a low-end gps device. It is acceptably accurate and provides basic location information. It is relatively easy to use as a means to record routes while hiking. The track back feature works just fine. A limitation is entering waypoints (termed points-of-interest for this device). The instructions for this feature are poor and it takes some playing around to learn how to do it... and even after one figures this out... it is still a tedious effort to accomplish. Another little problem is the buttons are easy to push and unless one is careful you find yourself staring at a menu screen that you have no idea how you accessed. So, placing the device in a protective case while hiking is good idea. If you are looking for a solid, low-end, inexpensive, gps device this will probably work for you."
5,Idaho Loners,"The author surmises that Idaho has more loners than any other western state, and he celebrates a dozen of them in his book. Whether Idaho has so many hermits because of geography or luck, it is a far richer place because of them!"
3,Yet Another Good Power-Metal Band,"Hammerfall is another good power-metal band from Europe. But watch out!...is just ANOTHER band. There's a lot of power-metal bands, some of 'em with great guitarists, bassists or drummers, and that's Hammerfall handicap. There's no genius on this band, and the music it's pretty much the same as any other power-metal band. So, if you're really into power-metal, you'll love this one."
4,Well done...,"One Vast Winter Count is an impressive effort that possesses a scope both expansive and easily traced. Typically, one is presented French, British, and Spanish regional influence upon local indigenous populations. Calloway provides this, but also discusses the impact of each regional upheaval on the whole. One sees how the Iroquois could affect the Comanche and the Frenchman rattle the Don.Equally refreshing is Calloway's impartiality. He is no one's apologist. His narrative is matter-of-fact and free of any apparent agenda. The book's subtitle is a bit of a misnomer as Calloway expounds quite frequently upon peoples and events substantially east of the Mississipi. But, no matter, for this serves to complete a remarkable story.Occasionally dry, but fundamentally entertaining, One Vast Winter Count is a comprehensive survey deserving the attention of anyone interested in the Native American story. I received an education worth the price of admission. 4+ stars for a job well done."
1,Hippo Not so good!,"If you love the original, this isn't it, very disappointing. The sound was not there and the singers voice changed the song from one that got me moving and loving the holidays to one I didn't. Search for the original version with Gayla Peevey."
5,Texas Longhorn Garden Gnome,The item received within 2 days and was delivered as advertised. It is a very cool conversation piece and not to large to set on a persons work desk!
5,Hook 'em in the Garden! SUPER CUTE!,"OK, the other reviewers may be right. This guy is not giant, but he is a GARDEN GNOME!!! We have a LOT, yes a LOT of Longhorn swag and this was a MUST for my hubby's birthday! It looks ADORABLE in our garden and has caught the attention of everyone who comes over. It is PERFECT in our backyard next to our patio! You won't be disappointed if you want a gameday, outdoor display of your loyalty!HOOK 'EM! Now, I am off to get the matching Cheerleader!"
1,I never received the item.,I tried to order this item. I was sent the wrong item. I was sent the university of Tennessee instead on two attempts.
1,Wrong Reviews!!!!,"None of the reviews I read hear pertain to the video in question. They all seem to be reviewing a performance by Pavarotti at La Scala. This performance is from Verona and Pavarotti isn't even in the opera. So I'm afraid readers have no basis on which to form an opinion from these reviews. Wake up Amazon and fix this. Not having seen this performance myself I have no idea how many stars to give, I'm just writing this to warn potential buyers."
2,Obvious Solution and Miserable Ending,"A terrible book. By page 94 (one third of the way through the book), the solution to the main mystery was obvious. This level of obviousness grew continuously throughout the remainder of the book until it was just plain embarassing. I spent two thirds of the book scratching my head, trying to figure out why Fletch, who is supposed to be brilliant, can't figure things out. There's no answer to this. Also, the ending tied to the secondary mystery is horrible. Unfortunately, there's not much I can say about it without giving it away. It's just all-around terrible and depressing. Stay away from this book."
4,Important look at a critical future technology,"I'd give the authors five stars on this except, as with Drexler's ""Engines of Creation,"" it's a bit dry and analytical for my taste. I'd very much like to see an update with more on the current prospects for nanotechnology development, along with more ""scenarios""--the authors' efforts to depict some of the ways in which it is likely to change society and the world. Those interested in this topic should be sure not to miss two SF books by Nancy Kress, ""Beggars in Spain"" and ""Beggars and Choosers,"" which explore potential impacts on society of genetic modification and nanotech. Interested readers should also contact Drexler's Foresight Institute (it's on the Web), which is working to encourage public policy debate on these topics."
5,I love my Wolf-Garten Tools,I love all my Wolf- Garten garden tools. It is so durable and is cheaper than made in china crap Lowes sells. Thanks to amazon.com introducing me to Wolf-Garten.
1,heartburn city,"I am not sure why this happened, I have taken Garlic for many years but add in CoQ10 and BOOM heartburn city. Needless to say, won't be getting these again"
2,"An author ""bigger"" than his subject","After reading this book I came to the conclusion that I prefer to read the books of Mr. Ressler's former collegues. I found his general attitude in writing this book to be if he did not profile the subject it was not done correctly. It is also apparent he has a recurring need to elevate himself above John Douglas which takes away from the subject in his book. This book would have been a better read if it had not ""starred"" Mr. Ressler as opposed to the subject matter at hand."
3,Small improvement over City Navigator N. America NT,"In planning a trip to the Bruce Peninsula, I thought that I needed a copy of this. The full name is MetroGuide Canada v4. I bought the CD. I'm disappointed in the number of business listed. As an example, in a 1.0 mile radius from the center of Owen Sound, I found 6 gas stations. Using City Navigator North America NT v8, I found 12! It was created in 2003, and the business data is a bit old. On the plus side, it identifies more roads and has improved detail on the lakes. All in all an OK product, but not really needed if you have City Navigator and don't need to know the names of the smaller roads. (City Navigator North America NT v8 comes free with the Nuvi 350, and came with my StreetPilot 330.)Garmin Nuvi 350 Pocket Vehicle GPS Navigator"
1,"Thin as a spiders web, but not as sticky","Well, I bought it, and got it and was very disapointed.I expected more from such a great armourer as R. Valentine. Instead I found great amusement in Brian R. Price's; Techniques of midieval armour reproduction, the 14th. century.If you want a book to show you how to make your own armour, or how it was done, buy the biggest book.B. R. Price - 485 pages + sources !!!!R. Valentine - 90 pages (mainly pictures)Norwegian Armourer."
4,One of tha best French albums ever!,This is really one of tha best! Phat beats with strong lyrical skillz makes that album a good representative of Golden Age era! Even it is from France. If you really like original Hi-Hop flava - then grab that CD unless it is available.Good for all real back in 90's Hip-Hop fans.
4,Baby steps,"Those who are fans of her later works should definitely check out this first album. Even in '93, she sang and played with total confidence. Afficionados will particularly note the early recording of ""Frim Fram Sauce,"" which also appears on ""All for You."" Here's, it appears in a much slower version. Listen for yourself and decide which one you like better.This album is a preview of Krall's slow, expressive style that becomes more fully developed on later recordings."
5,Big HEADED Girl from a SMALL town,"Personally speaking, I really dig this CD. But many may say that I am biased because I know the artist personally. I can truly say that my ""little"" sister has grown with her music. Delilah has away with words and expression. She has always strived to be different and she has totally succeeded in this venture. To know her is to love her, and to love her is to love her artist genius. She is as beautiful as an artist as she is as a sister. She will be a force to be reckoned with. Delilah Harris will be amongst the Jill Scotts and Alicia Keys, just listen to what I tell ya!"
2,Its a book,Save your money. This book did't teach me anything about PDA's. That I don't already know. You will be fine reading the info in the Book that comes with the PDA. All the basic stuff thats in the guide book that comes with your PDA is in this book. So I don't know why this was written. I was hoping to get some interesting info and get more use out of my PDA. But everything it covers I already know. If you dont have a guide book for your PDA that usually comes with the PDA than by all means get this book. Other than that it was useless to me.
1,Snore,"Pointless. I'd expect more from a Lydia Lunch project. This Gergrotis person conducts tedious, self-serving interviews and writes like an pseudo-anguished 16-year old. The rest of the writing is equally embarassing, mundane at best. I'd only recommend purchasing this in order to sell it as a collectable in 10 years."
1,a warning before you buy....,"The distribution rights to Trellix Web were sold to globalscape, the creator of cuteFTP, which plans to incorporate Trellix into it's product line somehow. There's no reference to Trellix at globalscape, so have no idea what the plan is, except that the press release says they plan to sell fee-based support and they also acquired the ""community"" (that would be you and me, the users, I suppose) and emailing list. The Trellix website, in the meantime, no longer refers to this software; the company is now in the business of private label web hosting something-or-other. So I guess we've been abandoned. I suggest you save your money because it doesnt appear that globalscape is supporting it on their website."
4,Rockers! rock,"Rocker! is a very interesting about the people who were the rockers. This is not a motorcycle book, per se, but a book about motorcyclists of the '60s who lived in a world devoted to motorcycles, a book about kids who wanted to have a good time without going over the edge in rebelliousness, but liked the power of the machine and image of ""Bad Boy."" I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the life style of the Ton-up boys."
2,Not so great,"To all those who are beginner's in electronics, this book will be lots of nightmares for you. The book is written basically for those who have lots and lots of time to waste. The wording is too technical, simple definitions for words like ""amplifier"" do not even exist. I have no choice but to attempt to read and understand this book, since my Electronics Design Professor required the purchase and use of this book. If anyone understands this book, please help me!!"
4,Good Quality,"This is a good bed for the price. It is very heavy and sturdy. It was easy to put together. It is very important that you be careful with the pieces when putting together. I just used a screwdriver and the instructions were simple to follow. Put the bed where you want it to stay because it will be very heavy to relocate. My bedroom is upstairs and I had to remove the pieces from the box to take them up. I am pleased with the purchase. The only drawback is that the mattress does not cover up the full surface of the bed and the surface should be the same color as the other parts. All in all I guess I could paint it, but it's not a big deal especially if you are using a comforter or bedspread. I also suggest you use a 13"" pillowtop mattress. It's very comfortable and I have slept better with this mattress than my old 9"" inch."
1,I should have trusted the reviews!,"The bed arrived with many broken pieces. Several of the reviewers mentioned this, but I thought I'd give it a try. The bed is poorly packaged, just cardboard, and the pieces are long and made of particle board, so it's not surprising that many had snapped in half. Also, this box is 140 lbs, so be sure you have help getting it into the house.It's just what I want in our spare bedroom, but as a long-time Amazon customer, I should have trusted the reviews and my instincts.Again, I don't think it's the bed per se, it's that it is very heavy and packaged as if it were a book, one cardboard outer box."
1,Save your money! Don't buy this!,"I think I got ripped off with this item. First of all, for the price, which wasnt that much, it still lacks quality. Second, all manufacturers of any type of wood products should specify if it's real wood or cheap particle board...like this item! It is so flimsy and cheap I regret buying it. And the shipping cost is way too high! And that makes this item TOTALLY not worth it! Now I have to try and sell it because there's no way I'm keeping this garbage."
2,Terrible customer service,"After waiting for two weeks, my bed finally arrived with missing hardware. Customer service seemed very clinical -- no apologies; they just took down my information and gave me a confirmation number. I got the feeling that this happens often. It's already been a week and I don't have the hardware yet. Total turnaround time from order to assembly is quickly approaching a month.I can't comment much on the quality of the product itself because it's just sitting in my garage gathering dust, but the faux ""wood"" is very cheap and it seems like it wouldn't take much for the boards to snap (they literally bend/wobble as you lift them). I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"Do not buy South Shore Furniture unless you are a self-hating, masochist.","This was not easy to assemble by myself. The instructions were somewhat confusing and difficult to follow. I called for assistance but the person I spoke didn't sound like she'd ever assembled the piece herself and was somewhat rude. I'd recommend letting people know, before they order, that the piece requires two people to assemble. Personally, I will NEVER again buy South Shore Furniture."
2,piece of JUNK!,"Don't buy this! If you plan on moving ever, this bed will not survive. Even moving it from one side of the room to the other the nails started coming out, the wood on the corners shifted. I guess you get what you pay for, better off spending the extra on something that will last!"
5,Dashiell Hammett's descriptive powers,"It is a pleasure to read so much about the author's life,as well as, stories from the start of his writing. It'sall there, the surprise ending and economy of expressionthat must have inspired Hemmingway. In a few words hecreated distinct personalities.(not all of them pleasant)"
2,Out of date,"It's a bit shocking that Amazon is still offering this book for sale, since after effects is now up to v 7.0. Get a more recent book."
5,Thinking Outside the Pixel,"After Effects is a very powerful and complex program, and for a beginner, such as myself, it is quite intimidating at first. The After Effects Bible not only provided clear explanations and tutorials that allowed me to get started, but it also enableld me harness more of the programs potential. Most importantly, it motivated me to ""think outside the box"" and to use the program in new ways. If you are going to use After Effects then you really must read this book."
3,hine sight 20/20,worked great on my 2217. however it is real stiff and hard to work with. I later found out from a forum to soak it warm/hot water first it will make it more mallable. It was down right fustrating without this knowledge.
1,poor quality,I was hoping to find the cups that go with the immersion blender. These are so flimsy I sent them back.
3,"Better than most children's music, but not the best Putumayo","While this CD is certainly a step above most children's music, it's not my favorite Putumayo album. It's a fun collection of folk and blues children's songs - and some of the tracks are real gems. Rhonda Vincent's rendition of ""Bananaphone"" is thoroughly catchy and danceable and Tim O'Brien's ""Man Gave Names to All the Animals"" is fantastic. I also love the versions of ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"" and ""You Are My Sunshine.""But the album as a whole doesn't flow well. It bounces around too much between styles of music for my preference. I feel like I'm always needing to skip certain songs - which seems silly when I have it on in the background while playing with my son. All told, if you're looking to purchase a good children's CD of folk music, pick up Putumayo'sFOLK PLAYGROUNDalbum instead."
2,Not As Impressive As Other Putumayo,"I love Putumayo Kids collections because I find them to be great for adults too, but this is an exception. This CD is the only exception, I don't find the instrumentals or lyrics fun, or interesting on this CD- not something I want to listen to."
5,Fun book and great behind the scenes stories,"If you've been dying to read a book written by a drummer from Minnesota who is a Harvard graduate with a degree in Afro-American studies, this is the book for you. I truly enjoyed reading the book. This wasn't the typical Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll diary that you usually get from musicians. Jake's tales are very amusing and his writing makes you feel like you a right there with him through the ups and downs. I was never a big Semisonic fan when they first hit it big, but I went out and bought all 3 of their CDs after finishing the book. It was interesting listening to each CD knowing the stories behind the recordings. You don't need to be a Semisonic fan to enjoy this book, but you probably will be one by the end of it."
5,Wonderful Inside Look At Music Business,"Its an industry that so many want to know. But when they arrive they see it for what it is, an evil empire of money, drugs and politics.Jacob Slichter hits the nail on the head with this book. His simplistic views in the beginning and his excitement are shared my millions who also want so badly to ""make it"".When he continues down the depressing but sometimes amusing path to one-hit-wonder-dom, one starts to see the record companies for what they really are.A sobering look at what it takes to get to the top and what it means once you get there. Jacob adds a great play by play on how radio, promotions, and recording all slowly suck the life out of music and send it into oblivion.A great read that I will be passing along to all of my friends."
1,This book was never published,"According to the author, Simson Garfinkel, this book was never published."
3,Agnus dei ora pro nobis!,"Let's forget the Boccelli fiasco, he is tone deaf. But the Agnus dei is worth the purchase, better than Toscanini and, deo gratias, without Andrea!"
2,Where's the Chorus?,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Verdi Requiem, at least in part, a choral work? Sure, these high-powered soloists do come through at pivotal moments (sadly, not always), but the real shocker with this recording is the chorus. It MAY be a good chorus, but the engineers have recorded the chorus in the Parthenon, or someplace where they are so far hidden in the texture they're often inaudible (even though they're fff). The ""Tube Mirum"" is, quite simply, laughable.Don't buy this. Period. There are so many better recordings of this wonderful work."
2,Oh please,"Why was this recording produced? There are multiple good recordings of Verdi's Requiem, and this cannot compete with them. Gergiev's operatic tendancies do him well here, but the orchestra isn't quite up to it. The etheral, religous sections lack passion and the full roar of the orchestra is a littel anemic. For sure, Fleming and Borodina sound very good, and D'Arcangelo holds his own. The worst part of the recording is anytime Bocelli sings. He is a pop star that sings Italian, not an opera singer. His entraces are crude, his tone weak, and his contribution to the piece is zilch. There really are many other recordings that are better than this, and this version should be avoided."
2,"The weakest point of this recording is, Bocelli!","The Orchestra and the conductor did a great job on this CD, but Bocelli's sound doesn't have enough dept for such a great piece that Verdi composed. If you heard the Karajan, Mutti or Solti recordings, you can feel the main difference. Bocelli doesn't have operatic voice like Domingo or Pavarotti. So this is very worng idea that choose him for sing in this piece."
2,Please don't do this...,"So I just keep looping the two Newman pieces...trying to get what I want. And sometimes, my heart breaks open again like it did in the film (you know the scene I mean). But God I wish I could have the actual sound-track that supported and permeated this film. Breathtaking. Until the real deal is available, I'll keep looping..."
2,"Great, but the most important song was omitted.","Great soundtrack. But for those who saw the movie,the most moving scene took place with the classic Neil Young song DON'T LET IT BRING YOU DOWN sung by Annie Lennox. But the CD doesn't even include this song. I'd like to find out why in the world this song was omitted. Does anyone out there have an explanation for this. It must be some marketing decision, I suppose. Doesn't make sense to me."
2,Missing the best...,"With a few exceptions (Cancer For the Cure, Free To Go...), American Beauty's soundtrack lacks the best music from the film . Thomas Newman's score is only represented by two short songs, the intro and the finis' of the film. A terrible mistake on the part of the producers to not include more of the score. I hope they will release Newman's exceptional work from this film on a separate album..."
3,Some great tracks,"In my opinion, there were really only 5 tracks from the cd that are representative of the film. Of those five, I like repeatedly listening to 3 - the first 2 and the last 1. Those 3 tracks are fabulous and for me, were worth buying the cd, although that is all I found spectacular on the cd. Unfortuneately the track where Mena Suvari's character plays something on the stereo is not included. If it were, there would be 4 tracks for which it would be worth buying the cd."
1,Brought Me Down!,"This CD does NOT even contain the best song in the whole movie- ""Don't Let it Bring You Down"" by Annie Lenox! What a total bummer! I'll have to wait until Napster is back on-line to get this song!"
4,Good movie companion,"I just wish there was a little more of the Thomas Newman score that responded unerringly to the entire movie, from the laugh-out-loud hilarous (and dreamy) to the cathartic and heart-felt tenderness. Add to that an eclectic mix of songs, and it's a great companion to the movie."
2,"Some Decent Tunes, but...","There's some decent tunes on here, such as Elliott Smith's 'Because' (messing with the Beatles is always shaky ground, but he pulls it off). And of course you can't go wrong with the who. I really don't understand the trend these days of putting songs on a soundtrack that weren't in the movie, makes no sense. Oh, and sense there seems to be some confusion, the song the girl plays in the scene with spacey is 'Don't Let it Bring you Down', by Neil Young. This version is performed by Annie Lennox, and can be found on Medusa. The original is on Neil's 'After the Gold Rush' album, which I encourage anyone who enjoyed the song to go check out."
2,Not what I expected. At all.,"There are some songs on this album that somehow I just can't fit into the movie, and yet I've seen this film 3 times ! I kinda wonder what they are doing there. Also, as alot of people have said, the most important songs are missing from the CD. I am now going to order the score, but I wish I'd known that before I bought this one ! Sheesh !"
3,Rather watch the trailer,"The trailers for this movie (there are several) all have little bits and pieces of great songs. Some were in the movie, some seem to only be in the trailer, but they're all great, and I wish they were on the soundtrack. Hopefully, they'll be on the score (which I preordered), but if they arent, I'm gonna be disappointed. Although everyone here whining about the missing Annie Lennox track does seem kind of bratty, considering there's people in Africa without food. :)"
5,the Chicago World's Fair Photographic Record,Photos are clear and explanations are well written. A very interesting time in our history!
2,Nice photos,Dull reading.The very interesting photos added a lot of background to my visit. The bridges and canals look the same and are charming in downtown Chicago. They add ambience to the city and made the river tour (I recommend it) more interesting after reading the history and knowing about the architecure when I visited.
4,"Excellent Video, Poor Audio","The Video display is excellent even when seen at 45 degrees angle, excellent recording and was even able to record movies I rented from Netflix. I have no technical problems with the unit I got. From personal experience the 30 gb unit could only hold no more than 15 full length 2 hour movies. The only negative comment is the very poor audio. I was on a plane trip to the orient and was very disappointed that I did not heed someone's advise to buy a noise cancelling earphone. An earplug type would be useless. The audio of my home movies was so much better. If you plan on recording rented movies there is no need to buy anything else but the base station which I used to transfer photos, music and home movies. I consider this unit useless without the base station. This product is highly recommended but don't forget to buy the noise cancelling earphones for long plane trips to enjoy your videos."
5,Gorgeous Sound!,I agree with the reviewer below. Absolutely gorgeous sound. One of the best recordings of Rachmaninov's Second Symphony I have ever heard. Passionate and lyrical. Definitely not to be missed!
3,Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving Diet left me craving for leftovers,"I am an avid Looney Tunes fan and I must say that Bugs Bunnys Thanksgiving Diet did not fulfill my every expectation. I was expecting a bunch of Bugs cartoons but instead it was a short, uninterupted movie. If you are looking for something different you might want to try this but if its the classic Bugs cartoons you are after there are plenty more tapes out there that you would be better off purchasing."
3,cannot order more than one,"I ordered 5 of these pails with lids. When you go to place the order, it defaults to 1 and it looks like the shipping is free. Watch out because you cannot order more than one at a time with $7.00 of shipping. The pail is of good quality."
3,as advertised,"Does what it's supposed to do--hold the ball while you hit it. Made from a very heavy rubber-like material, so it's a bit heavy to cart around. Also, it was out-gassing a solvent-like smell for the longest time, which is OK outdoors but oppressive inside."
1,Not top quality,My husband wasn't happy with these hammers. They were not first quality and we won't use this company again. The hammers were dented and just not what he expected at all.
2,Almost perfect ...,"Liked some of this flatware - used it with the bamboo plates. However, the knife is next to useless - it looks like it should cut well, but the edge is very dull and because it is not serrated, you have to saw at your food to get it to cut. We used it on a Calzone made with pizza crust and ended up having to hold the crust with the fork and tear the pieces off with our hands. NOT good. Will not order these again unless they find a way to make these cool-looking knives actually cut! And the spoons seem very shallow - we didn't really need them for dessert, but I would think for something like ice cream or something with any liquid to it, they would tend to drip over the sides as they are relatively flat. As the pieces all are, attractive - but that doesn't trump usefulness."
1,Wrong classification!,I was looking for books on the current conditions of the American economy and discovered this marvelous treat--an American Bible! Obviously the computer picked up the words American Standard Economy and turned this very religious text into a treatise on Mammon! Just thought you might want to know.
5,Sleepy Eye,"I purchased the patch for my Dad who had a ""sleepy"" eye as a result from a brain tumor. The patch forced him to use his ""sleepy"" eye, which was a good eye. He wears it at home while he's doing his daily routine and takes it off for bed and showers....it has improved the functionality of the ""sleepy"" eye."
3,"Okay, but not the best","When I started reading this book, I thought it was going to be really different and better then the old babysitters club. It was quite good, but I think the new series will be better then this super edition. I thought so many members leaving all at once was a bit sudden- some of them should have left earlier. I also found it confusing since it was all written in letters and diary enteries. I think the series is changing for the better, but this book isn't the best of the new series"
5,phone case,i like the case because it fits my phone very snug . and when i drop it it has some cushion to it .
2,So dumb I had to watch it.,"If there were such thing as a D or E movie, this would be it.Very dumb, poor acting, sound doesn't even sync with mouth movements.Otherwise remotely interesting. Still 2 stars."
1,Horrible Acting,Don't even waste your time adding this to your watchlist or buying it. Even the actors in this movie seemed bored to be in the movie.
1,Crappy Knock off don't waste your time,"Very bad movie, I made it 10 minutes in which is 9 minutes too long.four more words n"
1,Horrible acting.,"Horrible plot, horrible acting, I am a big fan of zombie movies and there are plenty of other good ones out there you can watch instead."
2,Watchable-ish,"It had zombies.. That's a star!It had a heavily armed nut spouting bible verses while he mowed down some zombies... That's a star!Hence the two star rating. otherwise it had all the pitfalls ""B"" grade zombie movies have... lousy acting, poorly constucted plot line, characters doing incredibly stupid things... ect. But did I mention it had ZOMBIES! So go ahead and watch it, ya know you want to!"
1,Not Worth The Rental Fee,"The movie has awful acting, special effects and camera work. I didn't get past the first couple of scenes. If I could get a refund on this one I would, felt completely ripped off."
4,Engaging and Interesting to the End.,"As a product of the 50's and 60's, I found Connie Wallace's book fascinating and eye-opening about life behind the scenes in Hollywood. It's a time when we lost our innocence, when the Nelson family motif became a thing of the past. No wonder our society underwent such an upheaval. I recommend it completely."
2,Arrived dirty and without any packaging,I've been looking unsuccessfully for mats this size for a new sink for quite a while. I was happy when I finally found one with the correct dimensions. I wanted 2 but only 1 was available. It arrived in a box with nothing else in it. It's dirty and had no packaging at all. Just a dirty mat in a box. Kind of creepy.
4,very good if you don't know much about Scotland,"I would recommend Scotland the Best! The one true guide first, but this was also good to review for the history, and the pictures before I arrived. It also helps to prepare you for the money, road signs, airports; things you will need to know if traveling abroad for the first time. Once I was there, I rarely looked at this book, but I would recommend this to prepare if you don't know the area at all. It is a good starter book."
1,Clayman,"Hogue Rubber Grip S&W; J Frame Round Butt Nylon MonogripDidn't like this item. I thought the grips were ""Rubber Grips"" and found out they're plastic! It does say Nylon Monogrip in the title but it's very misleading. Hogue needs to take the words ""Rubber Grip"" out of the title...plastic grips for a J frame S&W; are of no value and it was a waste of money to order them. The Hogue Rubber Grips that are all rubber are an excellent item. I have a pair for my ruger SP101 and they're awesome...but these suck..."
1,Tetsujin 28 - The Movie,"Called a Live Action Movie, this is indeed a movie, it is live, but it is void of any action. Take two action figures make them face each other with fist draw. Hold them at the waist and swing at each other this is exactly the type of action you will see in this movie. I love Gigantor (Tetsujin 28) but I need to save anyone else from blowing any type of money and more importantly time watching this movie."
5,LOVE This ONE !,"Get ready to trim those chubby legs...I do this EVERY other day - and what a pay-off....I LOVE Cathe's videos. She is easy on the ears, and does a GRREAT job coaching !!!"
2,Sad to get hear this after waiting so long,I was very let down to wait so long for a new CD and it turn out this way. There is just no real magic to any of the songs and it is a real shame because I know that there is a lot of talent in this group. I do love the lead singer Natasha's voice. I think she is the strongest of the group and I'm pleased with her singing. I don't like that Fleetwood Mac cover song and I don't understand why it was picked to be on the record when there were probably a lot better songs. I agree with some of the other reviewers about it sounding too Nashville. I hope the next time they have a record come out that it will not be so pop music sounding. I am a fan so I will listen more times and hopefully the songs will grow on me.
1,Spend your money somewhere else,"Man, what a big mistake it was to spend my money on this one. I read their story and thought it might be interesting. I like all different kinds of music but was so let down to listen to this one. There is no feel at all. Yes I know they are classicly trained but what they might have in chops they don't have in real emotion musically. This record is all over the place. This band doesn't seem to know who they are and seriously lack direction. They are labeled bluegrass but sound like bad, outdated pop music with a Russian accent. I don't know if this was another ""Nashville Novelty"" but that's what it has turned out to be."
3,Bering Straight Pages,"Not nearly as good as their previous CD. There are a couple of good tracks but others will put you to sleep however, if you like Bering Straight it's worth it for the couple good songs. Back in the studio Bering Straight needs to add more intrumentals for that great Bering Straight sound"
4,Good but not great,"There's not as much of a country sound on this latest release. If that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. There aren't any of the catchy, toe-tappers like on the first CD. Overall, it's an easy-listening type CD, not what I expected from Bearing Strait."
2,too complex and confusing,"I own the original Imperialism and found that game quite addicting. So, I thought Imperialism II would be the same. Nope. Imperialism I was OK, but Imperialism II is just a poor game. It's too confusing to actually enjoy the game. While you're worrying about getting your sugar (or whatever) back to Europe, you have to find time to build military units and others to defend yourself against the invincible AI player. The game is very interesting to play, but the realism is lacking. The AI players are perfect and we know that in the real world every country makes blunders. Maybe I'm just stubborn and havn't dedicated enough time to pull apart the game, but man doing that would put you in a state of confusion."
3,sizing not accurate,"I found this bra style to be sized larger than usual compared to those I had tried in stores. I was having a hard time finding a size in the Playtex brand large enough in my local stores, but when ordering this style one size larger than similar Playtex bras, I found it to be way too large. Otherwise the product would be fine. Unless you are sure of the sizing in a style you have already worn, you may end up having to return it."
2,Some good stuff here and there,Not too much footage of any clear quality. Not much Floyd in general. It has some good moments though. I was expecting something different. I would have liked to see a whole performance of Atom Heart Mother.
5,shun nakiri,"Great knife, well worth the buy. I'm a chef in a busy kitchen and i use it everyday, it's razor sharp and easy to maintain. I would reccomend it to anyone."
2,What are people smoking?,"It is clear that one reason Japan has had zero growth in the past few years is a failure to transform in services sectors, something the US has been doing since the early 1980s, if not earlier.Sure, there has been too much hype around many symbolic based jobs, but this book is far from an antedote. Fingleton writes well, but he has been completely stuck on one pattern of thought for a decade now.I'm sure he will be vindicated any day now. Marx too....."
4,Very nice,"I saw this in the new book section at Borders yesterday, and it intrigued me. It is a funny shaped book (something I'd expect from Europe), but thick (about half as thick as it is tall). It was shrink wrapped to prevent browsing it, but the subtitle ""African Wisdom for Every Day"" intrigued me, so I snatched it up as I walked past on the way to the cashier. I started out reading each quote and looking at each picture and reading each caption, but there is too much. So I just looked at pictures. The pictures are worth it. The quotes are nice too, but I've not really had time to read many of them.It definiately makes me want to buy the other books he has put out. I may get my grandmother a copy of this one for Christmas."
4,Great Workout,"This is a great workout dvd, I have tried alot of her workout dvd's but this is one of her best."
3,Warning to WH40K fans: This is NOT Chaos Gate with Eldar.,"While the computer game Chaos Gate is a faithful translation of the tabletop game, Rites of War is a radical departure. The combat is nothing more than a WH40K mod to Panzer General 2. In my opinion the combat is dumbed down and overly simplistic. However, I am a fan of the tabletop game, and play Elder. So my disappointment is stems from disappointment that the game is not what I wanted it to be (faithful to the tabletop game).The game does have a few redeeming qualities. It explores the rich culture of the Eldar race developed for the tabletop game Warhammer 40K. It is also fun to watch your units gain experience and improve.While my expectations kept me from loving this game, I was able to play it through and can say that I did get something out of the game."
4,The Spirit of St. Francis,"""The Perfect Joy of St. Francis"" is a novel about the life of St. Francis of Assisi. It is interesting and acquaints the reader with the facts and legends of St. Francis' life. It seems to be tilted toward the idealized view. We look to this book for the Spirit of St. Francis. It makes me want to read a real biography, both because ""The Perfect Joy of St. Francis"" piqued my interest about this giant of Church History, but also because it leaves my interest unsatisfied. It can do the same for your."
4,A very good book !,The author has done a marvellous job in presenting the fundamentals of economics. The author explains the material in a clear and concise manner and uses real-world examples to further enhance the understanding of the reader. Problem sets presented at the end of each chapter are exhaustive and rigorous.
2,unsatisfactory,"The same theme is elaborated endlessly and repeatedly thus wasting pages and the reader's time. No bibliography. Is this supposed to be a layman's book where the reader trusts the view of the author without being given a clear indication of the exact sources of the data? It seems geared to sales by trying to be provocative, but fails in this. Perhaps the author believes his own publicity."
5,Medicates shampoo to stop itching,"My vet recommended I use this shampoo to help with my dog's itching....right after my breeder told me that I needed to have this shampoo in stock at all times and use it when my dog had the itches. She (my breeder) told me to go to Amazon and buy it and what it would cost at my vet's. I did. By the time I saw my vet (who said the same thing about having it on hand and using it) I told her I had ordered it and that it had arrived the next day -- although I did not pay for overnight shipping. My vet said the price I paid was less than the vendor paid for it wholesale to sell to the vet.Good work Amazon!The shampoo works great, smells nice and best of all my dog is more comfortable after I used it."
5,Finally Overcame Recurrent Staph Infections,"Our now 11 year old cocker spaniel has been plagued with recurrent, antibiotic resistant staph infections for the past three years and daily baths with Duoxo finally delivered the cure. The cause of the staph was due to her compromised skin and coat from hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies. After reading an article by a Houston veterinarian specializing in dermatology who recommends daily baths in combination with the Allerderm spot on treatments, I committed myself to washing our dog every day for at least three weeks straight. We immediately saw a change in our dog; she was not itchy and miserable and the staph finally cleared. I kept up the daily baths for three weeks and then bathed her every other day for two weeks, to now we maintain a twice weekly schedule. It has made a world of difference and the infection is completely dormant. I highly recommend trying this shampoo and talking to your vet about the Allerderm spot on treatments."
3,You get what you pay for,"Was on sale for $50, and that's about all I would consider it to be worth. Nice chain, though."
3,it isn't really that bad for taste,"i was really curious so i bought one at my local supermarket for a dollar. it was on sale for 10 for $10 that day.the taste i would say it is an acquired taste. if you do not like tofu and soy taste this is not for you. some people hate the taste of tofu. i like tofu so the taste was okay for me.i must say the texture ... it is very hard like dried up tofu texture ... hard and chewy. i will not feed my toddler this because he is definitely going to choke on it.the flavor ... it is okay with the berry ... a bit tangy.i have to say for the calories not being small in amount, i prefer to get a kashi bar with nuts instead."
1,"Breaks on 2nd use, cheaply made plastic","A video review was not possible, as the device broke on it's second use. Even the first use demonstrated that it was clearly cheap and flimsy. On first view it is compact and apparently clever in its design. It seemingly provides good leverage to open wine, which is important for my friend who has an arm injury. Unfortunately the plastic lever arm snapped on opening an ordinary bottle of wine (which was opened easily with a standard sommelier's wine opener) and was useless after that. I absolutely advise that no one purchase this device, but to go for the rabbit style device instead."
1,Buying a Japanes-English Translator,"I wanted to by this product but I am not sure if it only translate japanese words to english. Can it also translate english words or phrases to Japanese (romanji, kanji, hiragana, and katakana)?Sincerely,Areeyah M. Castaneda"
2,Great Stone but fractured on delivery...,It was cracked in the lower left corner. But I am still able to sharpen my knives to a pretty nice edge with it. It's a good 300/1000 stone. That said I think in order to split hairs with my Japanese steel ill need at least a 3000 grade stone and a leather strop.
1,Look for another training source,"First of all, don't be fooled by the title ""Training From The Source"" or the Macromedia logo. These books are NOT a product of Macromedia. This book jumps from point A to point G; and then from point H to point C. There is no logical flow of information that will help you build an understanding of what the author is trying to convey. I strongly recommend that you look to another source for learning Flash (and all other ""Training From The Source"" books; as they all seem to have the inherent problem of missing information, no logical flow, and continued frustration for the serious student who is forced to look to another source to get conclusive and comprehendible training)."
3,Average Beginner Book,"Overall, not a bad beginner's book. Being a Flash beginner myself with a decent programming background, I found some of the examples lacking in explanation. Many of the examples that source data from the flashtfs.com website do not fully work yet, and some of the screen shots that assist with the examples are not accurate, which leads to more frustration than anything.Like the other Training from the Source books I have been through, the format is solid with starting, intermediate and completed files for each chapter on the CD.I am now moving on to the ActionScripting Advanced book by Derek Franklin and Jobe Makar..."
3,From novice to computer programmer in 12 easy chpts.,"I just finished going through this book. Well, actually I almost finished. I was on the last chapter and got so tired of typing actionscript that I stopped. This book is pretty good at going over the basics with some helpful tutorials, but it quickly changes into programming 101. I lean more towards the designer side of Flash, so I have no need to use actionscript to do everything for me. I know a lot of this stuff can be done in a much simpler way with less scripting, although typing out the code to do it is probably less time consuming. I can't say who I would recommend this book to. The first half is great for people completely new to Flash, but the second half is good only to people who really understand actionscript (and they shouldn't need this book)."
4,GOOD....,LIKE JARE not much i can say but that you will like it if you know about the other books in the series and if you never read the series then get the frist book that started the series its a good quick read and enjoyable......Everybody has a different opinion when writting a review if we all had the same reviews or opinions it would be boring. Reviews can sometimes down play a really good book or up play a really bad book its up to us to read the book and judge for ourselfs and draw our own conclusion thats the best thing about a review its like a silent debate....
4,A fun view of the life of an actor and a Geek,I really enjoyed Wil's story and recant of his life before and after Star Trek. I could relate to so many different stories and found myself laughing out loud at times. I am so happy to see books like this being created and shared. His story is inspirational because it reflects the real struggles to find out who someone is and in the end be proud of that person. Thanks Wil for sharing a wonderful story.
4,A Geek,"Nice to see what Wil Wheaton has done beyond Star Trek. He's a very smart and funny guy, and the book is quite amusing."
4,Great read - but numerous formatting issues,"The prose is wonderful. The Kindle formatting leaves much to be desired, though: there are multiple typos, words overwritten on each other, cases of errant punctuation and so on. Particularly frustrating: the book is a collection of blog posts separated by editorial from the author. In the physical book, it's easy to discern where a blog post ends and the commentary begins. On the Kindle, it's quite challenging."
3,Recommended only for hardcore Trek fans,"OK, Wil is not ""just a geek"" he is that dude from Stand By Me and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Unfortunately, Wil quit Trek and was essentially blackballed by the producers and he struggled to get acting work after that for a number of years. This book is about him realizing that he should ""write."" Recommended only for hardcore Trek fans (like me!)."
3,Word Search,The type on this is a little small. If I would've known it was that small I wouldn't have ordered.
2,Ordinary.,"This CD is just to promote his book. The music is, OK. But i would waste your money buying it. He's book is worth it, not the cd. The only good thing is the advice he gives in between the tracks."
3,Too redundant.,"I'm with the other person who gave the book 3 stars. This book was way too redundant. A Criminal Injustice is starting out much, much better."
1,Is it really tool?,"Or is it a hardcore version of The Police. I know they are influenced by Pink Floyd and King Crimson, but he sounds a lot (ok maybe a little) like sting to me. This cd doesnt suck, its just not great, or good, ok it sucks I hate to admit it."
2,Dull...,"I must say, I'm baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews this album has received on this site. Aenima is perhaps the best album I have ever heard, so I had high expectations for Lateralus...I bought it the day it was released, and was immediately disappointed.I listened to it many times, forcing myself to give it a chance even though I had to constantly fight the urge to turn it off. It never did grow on me.Dull. Boring. Songs that stretch on mindlessly...just length for the sake of length. What has happened to my favorite band?!?! Aenima, Undertow, Opiate...all are far superior to Lateralus.I just don't understand all the praise."
1,Tool for tools,"It shouldn't be a suprise that Tool's latest release ""Laterlus"" is a lackluster, commercial effort since it followed the equally commercial release of ""A Perfect Circle"".I never thought that I'd see the day that Maynard would sell out. This release is stale, monotonous, and repetitive. It seems that the members of Tool were more involved with the packaging than with the music. Of course, to the masses, ""Laterlus"" will be hailed as a masterpiece.Tool does nothing new, nothing innovative, nothing gripping. The cd is frankly one big potpourri of songs ripped off from their own library of music.After having to swallow the muck ""LATERLUS"" has to offer, listening to the earlier material becomes increasingly more difficult because after the mystique they had created as a band, how can one take them seriously now?"

5,Tool's finest hour,"Lateralus is the pinnacle of Tool's evolution as a band. It's not as heavy as their previous albums, but that's okay. Lateralus continues the Tool traditions of thought-provoking lyrics, excellent drumming from Danny Carey, and bizarre song titles. Simply put, no one should give this album less than a five-star rating. This IS the best album of all time."
4,Best hard-rock band today?,"Perhaps the best hard-rock band today, all of their albums to date play like a pretty respectable ""Greatest Hits"", churning out one 4-star rocker after another, interupted only by the occassional 5-star doozie. Hall of Fame sure-shots, it's quality material that will hold up well over time, making all of their albums almost mandatory purchases. Yeah, that good!"
5,BEST TOOL CD EVER!,"If you buy one cd this year, make sure its this one. As soon as you get the time, goto the store and get yourself a copy of this cd. Every song on this cd is a hit, there isn't one song on the entire album that isn't great. Tool did a great job on this album, it was worth the long wait."
5,wow,Incredible. I listened to the whole thing last night at midnight when I bought it. It just keeps getting better and better.
5,Awesome!,"I reckon this is a pretty awesome album. If you can appreciate the melodic and complex rythms created by Tool, coupled with some awesome vocals from Maynard, then the chances are you will like this. If you're into a more straightforward sound or aren't a fan of Maynard's vocals, then don't buy this!"
5,The CD that made me Fall in love with Tool's Music,"This album was the first Tool album I ever owned and I will never regret picking it up off of the shelve. The best way to describe the album is that it is peiced together like a epic story Climaxing at ""Lateralis"" the convex for the title and ending with the usual tool distrofusion of art. The album hits you like a thirty pound sledge and sends you into a journey of trancical music that you can't stop listening to if you try. If Tool had made this album one single track it would have been fine with me. The album moves with itself so fluidly it takes you with it. I find it more similar to the Flow that is represented in ""Undertow"" except the pattern of listening has been adapted for our listening pleasure. This is not a Cd of hit songs, but a masterpeice as a whole."
4,--------------------------------,"I know by giving this album 4 stars I'll just be considered a sheep or MTV fanboy or whatever but I dont care. I am tired of reading review for cds with people saying ""Oh all the little nu-metal generation kids will love this but only them and only because they think it is cool."" I listen to music for my self and no one else and I dont need corporate rock radio and MTV to tell me what it cool and what it not.This CD is OK by Tool standards but certainly nothing incredible. Musically they are advancing but Maynards lyrics are kind of bland and cookie cutter. My favorite track is Ticks and Leeches. just because cannible corpse and nile and stuff can drum at hyper speed doesnt make them talented. The worst track is probably the last with a bunch of static and some guy talking about area 51. dont buy this just because you're linkin park buddie says its cool but if you are a tool fan or music lover pick it up."
3,later less,"Well I have listened to the new Tool cd lateralus quite a few times. I am still waiting for it to hit me. It seems a little slow in comparison to past. Since I had to wait a little longer that expected to get my hands on the new album, I had some built up expectations. The verdict: It hasnt lived up to the hype."
4,A very good albulm,"Tool is finally back... During the 90's if it wasn't for bands like NIN, Manson, and Tool I would've stopped listen to radio a looong time ago. So I rushed out and got Tool's latest offering Lateralus and came away satisfied and somewhat annoyed at the same time.The good is Tool is back in fine form with a mix of Tool's trademark sound with a dash of A Perfect Circle thrown in the mix. Maynard's voice is without a doubt the most beautiful on the rock scene. And the band follows in suite with dynamic, disturbing, yet always beautiful music that only Tool can perform. Its going to be a shame though since Tool's music will be drowned out by all the bullsh!t music today.My only grip is all the wierd songs that make no sence at all. So dont ecpect 13 great songs as I did... Thats the only negative I can give Lateralus, so if you are a Tool fans or just looking for something unique go get Lateralus right now.Note... If I could give a 4.5 I would."
4,"Excellent, but Tool's worst album","I like it a lot but it's just not up there with Opiate, Undertow, 10,000 days, and especially Aenima (dont know how to do the old english thing). Still, this album surrounds you like a storm, it radiates with a positive energy, and it is truly an album you can feel. It has more of a buzzing bee sound than tools other albums. Its great, for any other band it would get 5 stars. But its just not quite as good as Tool's other albums."
2,Yawn.....,"This is your typical Tool album. Tool is quite possibly the most overhyped/overrated band since Nirvana. The have a good vocalist, and write excellent lyrics but the music overall...well it just fails. They've been around for over a decade and haven't really altered their supposed ""genre-redefining"" sound. It's all the same, the quiet to harsh vocal stylings, the percussive guitar/bass playing, the only thing that changed is the drumming which sometimes can get pretty interesting. Tool's typical flaws are here as well. The redudant, often mundane guitar playing, the samey-sounding songs, the 2 or 3 weak tracks that really have no purpose...Tool too often borders the line between mood setting music and boring filler BS. If you want a band that reaches the deep, mind-blowing experience Tool tries to do, try Neurosis."
2,POSSIBLY THE MOST BORING OVERRATED BAND???,"I think this band is SO overrated, first of all why are they so geat..hmm they can play a simple riff over and over again, and its called BRILLIANT!... But seriously these guys arent anything special"
2,Think For Yourself,"With all the hype of TOOL's new album, one should stop and think... If you have not been with TOOL from the begining and you find the album ""Phenominal, brilliant, mind bending, The coming of a new dawn(?), etc."" more power to you."
5,Lateralus Vinyl,It's great. The sound is amazing. It has reached all my expectations. I recomend it to all Tool fans (with a vinyl player). You have more sound definition on vinyl than on cd. Just try it!
1,I think I'm missing something...,"I saw a lot of stuff about how awsome and amazing TooL is and everything, so I decided to try them out. I heard Schism, and I thought it was okay, but not to great. Anyway, I've concluded that TooL is not what it's lived up to be. TooL is not very good at all, in fact, it's horrible. Totally horrible. I would not reccomend this CD to anyone at all. I was hoping TooL would be better than this, and Manyard would have a decent voice. I can't stand listening to his awful singing. Ugh. Maybe I'm missing something. Don't waste your money on TooL, and listen to something better, like Taproot."
1,Can't keep the balls in the air,"Though this is Tool's most commercially successful album it is easily their most repetative, over-produced, and weakest album to date. The effort can be heard-that is clear-but the delivery is way off mark. Aenema was an unequivocalbe album. It raised expectations to perhaps an unreasonable level because Lateralus falls below even their debut ep. I have no doubt that Tool while rise from the ashes of this wreck; but, we are still waiting for that Phoenix"
5,IT'S MORE THAN MUSIC,"i think tool is more than music,are feelings, with four incredible musicians and songs like the grudge, lateralis, ticks and leeches,reflection, parabola, schism,the patient and triad ,lateralus is with aenima the two best cds in the history of rock.long life for tool."
5,best of its kind,probably the best cd of its genre. it takes a little to get used to but after that initial phase it just gets better exponentially everytime you listen to it. can't wait to see them in concert.
2,Also sounds like a bad pressing to me.,"This is indeed a superb album in every aspect, one of my favorites. I was expecting this vinyl to bring it to a whole new dimension of musical goodness, as most vinyl tends to do. Instead I hear lots of distortion and crackling even after cleaning the vinyl many times. I am very disappointed, but at least the picture discs themselves look awesome."
5,incredible,"up until a friend had introduced me to this album, i had never sat down and seriously listened to metal, or anything ""heavier"" than Bach or Coletrane, discarding the entire genre as mediocre and being without musical depth. and for the most part, that is still my opinion, tool and specifically lateralus being one of the only exceptions. to lay it right on the line, this album is absolutely mind blowing. it actually inspires musical thought: the subtle complexity of the time signatures, rhythms, lyrics and overall concept of the album supersedes anything i have ever heard outside of classical music, and even then it is a close call. this album has expanded my mind as to the impressive beauty that ""mainstream"" music can possess. entirely incredible, almost unbelievable."
2,Not for Tool fans,"If you were a Tool fan for Opiate, Undertow, or Aenima you would probably be better off borrowing this from a friend. It lacks the emotional lyrical release we all expect and crave. If you are into weird feedback and guitar effects, go for it! It would make better background music at party than something to really get into. 3 songs are pretty darn good the rest is pure FILLER. I think this will be their last album together."
3,What Else is New?,"The biggest problem I have with this album is that it sounds like Tool...strange huh? What I mean is that you'd expect something new and fresh from these guys after a 5 year absence. Unfortunately, you get just another Tool record. What makes it worse is that Maynard tempted us so with 'A Perfect Circle'. Now we expected something different.If you liked AENIMA then you will be able to tolerate this record. The songs are long and the patience is growing thinner..."
1,... This reeks.,"I've been a Tool fan for a decade, but it seems they've lost it. It's hard to stay young, angry and alive in rock and roll. If a rock star keeps partying for too long, the drugs make just about anything sound good, and it seems that's what has happened here...The vast majority of this stuff is aimless, spiraling, and totally lacks any accesible or interesting melody - like a big, repetitive buildup machine that never leads to anything. If you're new to Tool, start from the beginning of their catalogue in your acquisitions. By comparison, this stuff [stinks]. It's no worse than most of the kiddie-punk...on the radio...but it is by NO means among the best albums of 2001. And it sure ain't quality Tool."
2,Boring Boring Boring,"For the life of me, I cannot understand what the big deal is with this album, or this band. I saw them live a while back, and left after the 4th or 5th song...I was so bored, it hurt. The crowd was as bored as I was..I love it when people try and make them this super group..please. Deep? Spiritual? Come on....Prentious, pompous might be more like it. Maynard was so bored he turned and faced the back of the stage for a few songs...turn your back on the audience?. He stripped down to just his red underwear....boy, that is deep and spiritual...I've seen hundreds of bands over the years, and this was one of the four most boring shows from the last 40 years...they will disappear in to the din of rock and roll..No loss."
4,Good progressive metal that is played on the radio?!,"Yes, that's exactly what it is. And I'm as surprised as you are. How on Earth is this band popular?! Not to say I don't wish them success. It's just very peculiar that, in a world dominated by Limp Bizkit and Slipknot, a band like Tool pushes their way into the mainstream.This is a good album. I say good because that is the perfect word. It's not GREAT, nor is it bad or average. If you're in the mood for a progressive metal album that sounds a bit different than the usual Dream Theater kind of stuff, consider picking this up."
5,Tool- the best,"Tool is my favorite band and, in my mind, the best band. Lateralus only further proved that point to me. If you don't already have this CD, get it! It kicks royal booty."
2,seriously overrated,"Not a terrible, terrible album, but overrated? Definitely. Although I am not the biggest Tool fan around, I like some of their work, and Aenima is a much better album in general. I can actually listen to songs like 46&2 or stinkfist or third eye, but only Schism and Parabola work for me on this album, the rest just [stinks]. Prog rock died in the late 70s, we don't need to revive bad prog rock again, and that's precisely what this album is doing. Just try and listen to the Grudge, and see what I mean...or Parabol or Ticks & Leeches or whatever."
2,GOOD BYEEE!!!,"Let me start off by saying that until this album came out I loved TOOL's music. It just misses the creativity they posessed in the old days when they just kept evolving from 'Opiate' to 'Aenima' because they probably wanted to make a more commercial album. And this means that the music must sound less complex (too many notes, Mozart. Cut a few and it is perfect). And just what is going on on their site? I visited it lately and there is this Blair guy who just keeps talking about Crowley and the Rennes le Chateau-mystery (It's solved a long time ago: the supposed grandmaster P. Plantard who was in reality the son of a farmer who produced wallnuts, made the whole story up with a companion and forged the parchments himself, he confessed this after a fight over money with his friend de Chaurissey, money from Lincoln & co), and poses on pictures which he shows on the Tool site..it's a funny looking guy...who is he anyway??"
2,Don't buy it - Tool has degraded to pop,Don't buy this if you are expecting something like the earlier albums. If you liked Perfect Circle (which I didn't) then this album is for you. This album has none of the raw power that previous Tool albums were based on. This is more of a melodic mellow pop-style album. Think of Metallica selling out and how bad there music became and you'll get the idea. I'm not saying that Tool is selling out but this album is not the Tool that I loved for so many years.
5,Excelent record!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Tool never sucks. Never!!!! How is that? Not one bad album. This is no acception...same great Tool sound. They still rock the socks off.
3,It was OK nothing compared to the past!!,"This album was good but not great. It is the kind of album you can listen to onced and thats it.It had a good base and a few great songs but it was bogged down with the slow drab songs.The patient i a good song and so is Parabola.I think Tool is beginning to let the artistic value of the music over shadow the musics thought..I love Tool they are my favorite band This album would be great if there was no such thing as nima and Undertow.Its a good CD to have in your collection even if it is not the best. If you want to get into Tool try listening to songs like Sober,Prisonsex, stinkfist. Tool's Great songs can bring a person to tears because of the emotional vibe.All the members of Tool are good musicians but in lateralus they seem to repeat riffs and the lyrics are kind of dull.Its not a waste of money but you shouldn't obsess over it :)"
5,This album is so stupid,"I swear to god this is the greatest band that ever existed. Lateralus is the expression of the evolution of Tool over it's decade of being together. Maynard comes stronger and heavier vocally than ever on this album. (Ticks & Leeches being an excellent example) Danny gets raw with his crazy patented rolls and claps. Justin really shines on this album, and Adam is more creative then ever.If you don't have this album in your changer right now, get it there!"
4,happy for the next four or five years until the next one,"the best thing in 2001......wait a second, there something else out there. i can't believe it, somebody other than Tool made a special album. and they're called System of a Down: it seems another band actually puts some thought into their music. if all is true about Lallapoloooza returning. I just found your co-headliners. I'm out"
3,wheres the rock?,If this is what we waited for after 5 years then I am very dissapointed. It seems that Tool is forgetting their fanbase and becoming more introverted. with this cd they are shoving their weird idealogies that where more tolerable and less overbearing on their last cd. the tracks are slow and plodding. less intense and imaginative. There is no sense of continuity. No sense of escapism that their previou efforts allowed.Nice cover though.
3,its good but im still feelin kinda cheated!,"well folks its good but not that good. i feel like the only one but i really wanted to hear some more ""power tool"" on this album but all i got was some more, much-to-mellow APC stuff. i really wasnt impressed with that album either. i was hoping for some more songs like part of me and opiate but i guess i should have guessed that the band had ""matured"" over the years and wanted to move forward. so in closing i want to say yhtat the album is good but if you want to hear the REAL tool sound, check out aenima."
4,"Yeah, Tool","I'm not a big rock or metal fan. There are very few groups in those genre's that I listen to, let alone listen to on a regular basis. Tool happens to be one of those groups. This cd, like Radiohead's ""Kid A"", was/is one of the most highly anticipated rock albums in a long time. I'm glad it's out so maybe it will change the rock scene from where it is to something more meaningful. This is a well crafted album. Songs are splendid, M. is at the top his game, the whole band seems well refreshed and ready to go. My favorite tracks #3, #5, and #8."
5,Get over what...?,"A spiritual journey that will open up your 3rd eye and make you see music in a different perspective. OK sure there are better bands out there. Like what?? sure you can compare. compared to what. Why dont you let us in on the big secret. What should we be buying? sorry charlie, Ill keep my tool"
3,Quite a good album,"***1/2 starsIt's nice to hear that even nowadays there are mainstream bands that deliver good music. It was quite refreshing to watch the Schism video in MTV, where crap is king usually.Being an avid fan of classic 70's progressive rock and progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater, the album results very appealing, with moody passages, the use of odd metrics, lenghty compositions and intelligent lyrics, along with the killer artwork. There are some low points in the album also, as it is a little bit too long and with some repetitive riffs. Perhaps it's not the best album for some since Tool music can be analized from very different, even opposed perspectives, depending if you analize it from the progressive rock view or from the contemporary metal view.What cannot be discussed is that the band has more talent and musical chops than almost anything else in the mainstream, sure beats Bizkit, Papa Roach, Korn, Kid Rock... you name it."
4,"Pretty good, up and down","Not as good as undertow, but as long as its tool its worth it.The grudge-The ultimate hook intro 9.5/10Eon blue apocalypse-Pointless, but a break from the average of ten minutes 7/10The patient-Alright but not the best 8/10Mantra- Pointless intermission 6/10Schism-Awesome 7 minutes of song 9/10Parabol-Great intro to the best song on the disc 10/10Parabola-Awesome song best on the cd 15/10!Ticks and leeches-Great song, very angry 10/10Lateralus-Mind numbingly long, extremely dull 6/10Disposition-Easy listening good song 10/10Reflection-11 minutes ... still good though 8/10Triad-All rightnot too good 7/10Faaip De Oiad-Bizzare, psychotically brilliant 10/10Buy it!!!"
1,This is a terrible item.,"I was aware of other customers reviews of this item, but decided to purchase it anyway. I knew this stock had a reputation of breaking so I decided to be extremly carefull my first few games with it to get a feel for its quality and found it had broke after my first match. After inspecting my marker I had found that the square peg broke right in half inside the marker. I believe that it actually broke or was cracked by the push pin during installation. Spend a little more money and get a better stock."
5,AWESOME!,"This was a terrific buy! It really made the the gun more comfortable and works great with a coil. (I have not tried, but I don't think it can be used without a coil). Save some time mounting it and squish the rubber washer into the stock itself. It took me longer than I am proud to admit to figure out that the washer was the thing that was fighting me."
2,Broke while shooting!!!,I thought this was a good deal when i first bought it but after a couple hours of shooting i went to shoot at my brother and the stock snapped and went flying across the room.. luckily i was holding the gun away from my body or it could have hurt me pretty bad. I don't think this stock is very safe and i would recommend the BT designs combat stock over this one.
1,TERRIBLE,This is the worst stock money can buy. i broke 2 of them with in 2 weeks the second one broke after 5 shot do not ever buy this barrel i give it a 0
2,Worked great for the time it wasn't broken...,"Piece of shet! how hard could it be to make one of these that doesn't crack after a day of playing?! I read the reviews on this b4 i bought and i figured they where doing something wrong but nope...i used it for a whole day of paintball and it broke right at the circular connecting piece on top i'm glad i noticed it as i was cleaning my marker during a break because it would have shot out at someone or me or my car window... my friend has one of these for his a5 that has a metal connector and i want to find that soo badly but he forgot where he got it, if someone finds it please mesg me on amazon (if u can do that) i think it's from rap4"
3,A5 Car Stock,This product was very easy to install on my gun. The only problem with the stock is that it snapped somehow during a game. I may have hit it against a more solid object but I'm not sure. It seemed sturdy enough until I looked down and it was broken.
3,not the best,I ordered this with 2 other stocks just to see which one i would like more. this was the worst one of the bunch. it does its job but it doesnt seem as solid as some of the other products i purchased. The best one i found is the same adjustable stock but it is tan. as long as you dont mind the color and paying less money for it. hmm your decision.
4,Bella Groovy!,"I discovered this CD during the summer in Tokyo, where it soon became a major groovey magnet! Everytime I was near an HMV or Tower, I found myself hungry to listen. I think the re-mixes are interesting interpretations on the original material. And though Nicola Conte himself provides the best bits, in my opinion, I highly recomend this compilation. If you're a Conte fan, or a lover of soundtrack/electric boogaloo, you'll enjoy Jet Sounds Revisted. And look for Tour dates coming, I believe, in the Spring."
3,You can turn them off,"There is a way to turn off the subtitles...it makes the movie much more watchable trust me. We watched it in my college spanish class and it took us an entire day but you are able to turn them off, you just really have to play with the dvd remote you have, once the movie has already started...it won't work if you try to turn it off in the menu, don't ask me why, because that would actually make sense haha...but it IS possible to turn them off, try and then watch it, trust me it's better!"
4,tango afficionados only,Wonderful and soulful. Very artistic and great sense of the real tang of Argentina. A must have for would be dancers of the tango. In Spanish with subtitles however.
1,Screwed-up DVD,"I had a rather elaborate review in mind before looking over those already filed. Obviously the only thing I can add to all of that is that I too received one of those DVDs with the Director's Commentary locked on, overriding the normal sound track. The special features menu provides buttons for turning commentaries on & off, but the links don't work on my copy. It would seem that when you order this DVD, you may or may not get one with commentaries locked on. Good luck."
2,Great for tango fanatics but maybe not for others,"This movie did have some great music and a few very interesting dance scenes, but overall comes across as a slow moving art film with not much of a story line. And, if you don't speak Spanish you'll have to pay attention to the subtitles or you'll lose track of what little plot there is.For those who have invested much of their lives in dance, and tango in particular, this is likely a very enjoyable movie. However, if you're just a first time tango lesson taker, or a non-dancer, you might find this movie tedious to sit through and you might be tempted to hit the fast-forward button."
4,Learn to dance Argentine Tango from this movie,"Beginners - you will have troubled following most of the material even with the rewind and slow motion buttons.Intermediate/Advance Learners - you will get some good ideas.Accomplished Amateurs - you will see nothing new.As a movie, the story line is very simple and not particularly moving, but it was beautifully done."
5,Review of Tango DVD,I was very happy to receive my Tango DVD very promptly and in good condition. Thank you to Amazon
2,The Darkness,I bought this game for my son. He beat it easily so now it just sits. I hated that I paid so much for so little.
3,The Darkness is cheap thrills,"I played this game and it can be very aggravating waiting for all the cut scenes when loading a new area of the game. This occur hundreds of times. Other than that, the game has a nice mobster vibe to it and is definitely a nice shooter. Very similar to Bullet Witch due to the extra abilities."
4,Pretty good.,"I got this as the first game on my 360. I had read some of the comics and liked them, and this had a pretty rad trailer. It is a good game that has good graphics, solid game play, and a cool story line. While it may not hold up against some of the games put out nowadays, it is very much worth the $5-$10 that it now costs."
3,DEMONS COMING OUT OF YOUR SHOULDERS?! NIIIIICE!,"Although I personally can only play this game for 30-60 minutes at a time without getting motion sick, the ""graphics""- emphasis on the word ""graphic"" -are sick, as is the game- literally! I mean, name one other game where you can run around as a former mobster who came back from the dead with submachine guns, commanding the legions of hell to spring forth from the ground- complete with combat helmets and chain guns -and have demon-like serpents spring forth from one's shoulders to ""Devour Heart"", using the ""A"" button?! AND THEY SHOW IT. NASTEEEEY!!!! Give it a shot, but take your dramamine for this motion sickness-inducing game."
3,Good for a playthough and some achievements,"Although I have nothing against this game really I dont see myself playing it throuhg more than once. For the purchase price of $4.98 I couldn't pass it up. As far as gameplay, design, graphics, etc...all that is fine. I'm just not into the plot or storyline. The Darkness powers do add a cool element to the game. This game is a good rental or purchase if you can get it for cheap like I did."
2,"Really, Don't Bother.","Cervantes said that sequels are notoriously bad. This book by Knight and Lomas is proof of his observation. It is a follow up to their prior bad work and builds on it, as they themselves declare. That being the case, be assured it is even worse for its far-fetched theory depends on convenient omission of facts that otherwise would shatter it, and the delusional views of their readership."
2,A different love story,"The Sicilian's Defiant Mistress by Jane Porter is somewhat different from Jane Porter's other Harlequins. It's a much darker story filled with secrets and revenge.The heroine is fighting with a lot of emotions and she has a hard time figuring out what she needs and what she wants.I had a hard time reading this story. It did not have the same easy flow as Jane's other books.I have read many of Jane Porter's books and really love them, but this one is the first one that is very different from her other books and I had troubles enjoying it."
5,Educational and fun!,These Veggie Tale DVDs are a wonderful way for my grandchildren to learn about Bible characters and silly songs! Fourteen years ago I bought my first Veggie Tale VHS for my first grandchild and today I am still purchasing these exciting and fun stories (I have eight grandchildren now!)
5,Great for the AP test!,"Wow! I didn't think that there would be a book to to help me study for the AP Art History exam, but was I wrong! This book is great, and covers exactly what I need for the test. A highly recommended buy!"
1,hey ho (yawn),"i guess i just don't do punk. i know it's uncool to trash the ramones, but having 10,000+ songs ranging from jazz, rock, pop, dance, hiphop, folk, indie, and more, this moronic, puerile stuff leaves me cold. i disliked it in 1979 and it hasn't improved on sampling their 'greatest hits' today. i'm not prone to neg reviews but just had to burst the 5-star bubble. if this is your bag you'll know within the first 10 secs because it's all the same."
4,continental 70's rock with all the spectrum,"this is the only time the exceptional dutch formation with the congenial van Leer/Akkerman creative souls was trying to go to extremes. Full spectrum - heavy guitar sound followed up by chamber music, occasional yodeling develops into tricky jazz patterns. The sound on this CD, however, despite being remastered lacks the depth of the analog recording, reflecting a common problem. Still, it is a fresh piece of music of a group still checking out its possibilities. And, it is featuring the most lyrical guitar player you can possibly imagine"
4,Dry food storage,"Love this system, especially the mason jar feature. I can utilize my mason jars for all kinds of dry goods and get fresher results than just screwing on the lid. Great if you harvest your own herbs and such!"
4,Fence is great...,"I will have to say that this is a good fence. It wasn't hard to install and setup once you understood how it goes together. The locking mechanism is solid and seems to hold well. the only thing that takes away from a 5 star review is the hardware (nut,bolts,washers). I don't think that the manufacturer could have used cheaper hardware if they tried. Come on, the thing is 275 dollars!!!! At least splurge and give grade 5 bolts!! And what's with a 1/4-20 bolt having a 10mm head, (really they have 1/4-20 thread and a 10mm head, WTF!!! I still REALLY like this fence for it's simplicity and repeatability but not for it's hardware. After the fence is shipped to you and you're going to install it figure out what bolts you need and make a trip to the hardware store and spend the extra 2 bucks that the manufacturer didn't want to."
4,Fun and Informative,"At work, I often struggle when I have to confront my staff. I don't like it. Most leadership books would offer me some platitudes, but not this one. Ms. Himsel suggests that we steal a page from Tony Soprano and speak our minds without any B.S. If an employee lets you down, don't mince words and make sure that there are consequences. Ms. Himsel also offers some good advice for structuring interactions away from the workplace and pursuing goals with higher-ups. Using Tony Soprano as a leadership model takes a lot of guts, and it may not work for everyone, but this book gave me some laughs and some ideas."
1,belfast gigs,"Yes, this album is a big improvement on the other(earlier) Horslips Live album in terms of production values and overall sound quality. Not that that would be difficult, considering how bad the first live album was. However, all of the tracks(apart from Shakin` All Over, which is a cover, of course, and not a Horslips song - another minus!) are inferior to their original studio versions. There is energy and enthusiasm here, sure!... but, musically, the studio versions are a hell of a lot better!"
1,"Um, no.","This movie is an hour and twenty eight minutes long. That makes it about an hour and 27 minutes longer than it should be. It's about a fat ""retard"" that's obsessed with the original film and tries to make his own human centipede. Skip it; I wish I did."
1,Ugh.,"If it was possible to rate this film at zero I would. It's that bad.Usually I can find a redeeming quality in a film... in this one the only redeeming quality is that it finally does end. I love gory movies; my friend and I cheered during the Saw movies, but this one just aimed to gross people out and get a reaction. There were a few moments where I actually thought I would throw up. Other scenes were little more than bad imitations of cheap porn. I can tolerate the black and white. I can tolerate the limited dialogue, I can even tolerate it having a stupid plot, but the cheap stunts and grotesqueness are intolerable. Don't bother watching it, The Human Centipede 2 is a far cry from the original."
2,Boo,I fell into all the hype and expected to see a horror movie like none I've seen. I was disappointed. Does anyone know of a true horror/ porn movie? I think this gives many ideas for adult viewers.
3,Gross Gross Gory Bloody!,"You have no idea just how gross this movie is! SOOO DISGUSTIHNG!and very hard to watch with all the blood and crap. It's a pretty good movie, not that scary, but kinda entertaining. VERY DisgustingI'm sure that many people have thrown up while watching this movie.The reason i'm only giving it 3 stars is because it was extremely disturbing!"
4,Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence,"Sick and Twisted. I liked the first film better. But this film does live up to its reputation of being one of the foulest films ever made. I did get a kick out of the main character Martin. The actor did a pretty good job playing this souless peice of garbage pervert. If you love to feel sickened and dirty after watching this film, this is the movie for you. I did personally feel a few scenes where a little unecessary but hey I got what I payed for. It took me a few hours to get over the pure freakiness of the film. Its like jumping on a mega fast wooden roller coaster that bloodys your knees and wrenches your neck. It sticks with you for awhile. Warning NOT FOR THE FAIN OF HEART. If you are twisted check this crazy film out."
2,Not the greatest,"Not the greatest movie, was not up to all the hype. Its different from most horror movies but it wasnt worth the money or time spent watching it."
1,DONT BOTHER,"THE FIRST ONE WAS BAD ENOUGH.THE SECOND ONE WAS GORY AND DISCUSTING.I DIDNT SEE THE POINT.THERE WAS AT LEAST A DOCTOR IN THE FIRST ONE.THE SECOND TREATS YOU TO A VERY DISTURBED MAN,WHO CANT UNDERSTAND WHY DUCT TAPE AND STAPLES DIDNT WORK.PLEASE"
1,A Cinematic Defecation,"I was not a big fan of the first Human Centipede, but I thought it was decent. I wasn't exactly excited about there being a Human Centipede 2, but I saw that it was at the top of my amazon.com recommendations and that it was available to watch instantly on netflix. So I watched it. It starts off okay, but it gets worse from there. This is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a ton of Troma movies and John Waters movies. In the third act of The Human Centipede, we get to see several people defecate in someone else's mouth. That scene alone should make any sane person not want to see this movie. This is the worst piece of trash I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of trash!"
1,Can't Get Past the Goth Thing,"This may be a great introduction to belly dance, but I will never find out as Ariellah gives me the creeps. I may be too old and to Midwest to see beyond her tatoos and vampire wannabe makeup. This DVD is going in the garage sale pile."
1,this is a flop,"No, sorry, but I was so very much disappointed with this album, that I cannot give it any higher rating. The music lacks the power Future Generation had, but I suppose if you like dance music, you may enjoy this. I hate dance, but i loved FG, so it tells something of the quality of music on those two... The only songs worth listening on Around the Planet are... Battle Cry and Final zone, maybe shotgun... well... don't buy it if you like Future Generation."
1,Another heartfelt one-star review.,"Not only was the plethora of non-plot related detail distracting, but the author's CONSTANT beating the reader over the head with the racial issues inherent in this story were artless. Why not let the reader arrive at the author's conclusion (the truth!) based on the events and conversations as they unfold? I felt like this writer was talking down to me. And, like the other one-star reviewer, I quit after 100 pages -- something I RARELY do. Biggest disappointment to me was that the always artful Toni Morrison should have known better -- or left this task to a better editor."
1,Just couldn't keep reading this book,"I have waited a long time for a book on the Atlanta child murders because I never felt this case was rightly resolved. However, when I started to read this book, I could not get past the first few chapters. The writing was too detailed - it seemed like I was spending three pages on what the characters ate for breakfast. I just could not finish this book. I agree that this subject is extremely important and tragic, but be forewarned that the plot really plods along in the beginning."
3,Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography Online,"This book would have gotten a 4 and one-half. The reason I gave it a 3 is that it is not current. It was published in 2001. This is important because the internet has changed since then.This book is exceptional because it gives you a picture of what the online CP situation was in 2001 and before. I assume that the difference today is more than in scale, although much of it may still be true. However, the men studied this book were technologically savvy. The huge number of men in federal prisons today are probably not technologically sophisticated and therefore may be different in other important ways. The book does not deal with this, yet the severe punishments given then are many times worse today."
3,Better titled Memoir of a Motorcycle Mama Martyr,"This could have been a truly great book and I'm sure there will be many who think it is.It strikes me that Ms. Larsen is a product of the postmodern academic milieu, as she seems to believe that two diametrically opposed ideas can both be true. She tells the reader that being alone is very important to her and then laments the very loneliness she spent so much time and so many words trying to extol the virtues of. It seems to me that she wants autonomy and intimacy at the same time.She makes a point more than once that she has a problem with religious proselytizing and yet the entire book is basically a work of apologetics for her worldview. I must admit that the preaching about gender stereotypes gets a little old.She is at her best when describing the scenery, people and situations she encounters on her journey. All in all the book is a descent read if you, like me, love road books."
5,sorceress,about Agnes a Indian college student who reads the diary of Mary Newbury and believes its writer a relative from some of the stories she was told when she was little. She contacts the author and they set out to finish Mary's story. The way they finish the story by that Agnes becomes Mary in a vision quest.In the vision quest she finds out the fate of Jaybird Mary and many other characters.It tells the rest of Marys life. This story is just as good as the first and even better when you read the first. The characters are greatly developed and even if you didn't read the first one you probably would understand this one.
5,Very Interesting Book.,"I belong to a christian group and heard about this outstanding book by Laura Esther. A friend loaned it to me. After reading it cover to cover, I have to admit, it is an outstanding book.My business is network marketing and I typically recommend classic self development books. The classics like Think and Grow Rich, Rich Dad Poor Dad and so on. For balance, I also recommend christian books by people like Rick Warren and Joel Osteen. I have now added this excellent book to my recommended list.While the book is focused on people who have been through a divorce or other emotion shattering events, it is a great book to come back from any adversity. Very inspiring and informative."
2,The Dangers of a First Person Novel,"Novels written in the first person can be very affecting. In ""Expendable"", Festina Ramos was very effective in this role. Her complex personality, with pain and paranoia foremost, came across as believable because she was telling the story, and made the entire book compelling.In ""Ascending"", Oar is the first person narrator. And (excuse the pun) Oar is a bore. We have no reason to like her, or care about her at all. In fact, the tedium of reading her banal comments virtually destroyed any joy in what otherwise might have been an interesting story concept.The moral of the story: Only try the first person ploy if it's a person you would want to hang out with. I'd probably skip this book if I had it to do over again."
4,Move Over Janet Evanovich,"If you like Stephanie Plum, you'll love Bubbles Yablonsky. She's a wild and crazy character and her co-horts are unforgettable.Try it, you'll like it."
5,abundantly passionate and loving,"When I first saw a clip of this movie, I must admit, I was attracted to the beautiful bodies and handsome faces. I was also drawn in by the sexual energy. However, watching the movie in its entirety, I found ""From Beginning to End"" to be so much more.There is a loving, extended family that share dinners and laughs. There is the main relationship between the two brothers. It is very clear from the beginning that theirs is a bond that can not be broken. The moments when they are in bed for the first time, confessing why they love each other is one of the most beautiful, romantic scenes in any movie I've ever seen.It is so interesting to see how they cope with having to be apart for the first time in their lives.After a while, I forgot they were brothers. It isnt really a factor in the movie after they become adults.I didn't particularly care for the subtitles, but this movie won't disappoint.From Beginning to End"
2,Meh!,"First off great subject, but I am not used to a movie with out tragedy or action. Mellow drama if there was any drama. Could have been better with more disastrous twists and turns. I was hoping one would die or commit suicide to make it real heart breaking, but it ended happily ever after."
3,more or less the same,"This may be called from beginning to end but when you get to the end, you're none the wiser, they're still halfbrothers, and i emphasize their different fathers almost as much as the DVD does, that are nice looking and enjoy each other's company. If that's sick or if it's not, I'm not sure but the yuk factor is kept below the surface by all those involved, including parents who probably should have stopped all this but by the time it gets to skype, they might as well be married for all the excitement this provides. Lovely people and scenery, that's about it."
5,true love overcomes,"The love of two brothers albeit half brothers was set aside by the story telling, the drama of the separation and simply just a great love story. I suppose the brother-gay love may offend, but the sort of love (sexual), fidelity and friendship transcended the ""taboo"" aspect. Get the kleenex out while you enjoy this movie"
4,"Beautifully filmed, well acted, but plausible story?","This film intrigued me due to its content, setting and controversy. I found it to be beautifully filmed, the actors were very good and the storyline interesting. All things considered, I kept wondering how likely this situation would ever be, unless there had been some kind of abuse to sexualize these boys early on. I also wondered how likely it would be that two brothers could fall in love and move out of the traditional brother-to-brother relationship. In spite of my doubts, I found myself enjoying the film and wondering how all the dynamics between parents, friends and others - as well as the brothers themselves - would play out and became hopeful for the brother-lovers. I wasn't disappointed."
1,"Movie might be ok,","Gave up because the quality was so poor, and it kept cutting out. This happens so rarely with Amazon that I was surprised. A waste of money."
4,Worth a look.,"Really enjoyed it! The acting and production levels are quite good. It's a controversial topic of course, but this seems to take back seat to the unique love story that unfolds. Very interesting."
4,Wow.,"I initially had reservations about the ""half-brothers-in-love"" aspect of this film. I thought I wouldn't be able to watch them ""together."" But when they finally slept together, I couldn't believe what shocked me the most. It was the fact that it seemed so NATURAL! An evitability. I think that even if Franciso had been sent to live with his father in Argentina (when the boys were young), I think he & Thomas would have ended up as adult lovers anyway. I think the mother knew that too. It was almost like she knew their bond was like some unstoppable force. She KNEW that there was nothing to be done.DIALOG SPOILER ALERT: When Pedro said: ""...I love you because for them to understand our love, they'd have to turn the world upside down. I love you because you can have anyone you want. But you chose me..."" OK, that pretty much did me in.I'm glad a took a chance and bought this film. Odd, beautiful; unusual, touching."
1,Weird,"This movie is just fuel to the fire that politicians need to make public hate gays even more. Being gay is fine and normal, but I am sorry relationships with siblings is not. It just a film to try and promote incest as normal behavior. I can recommend that, that is just not beautiful at all to me."
3,The movie did not end soon enough.,"Although the film was very well acted, scripted, and really a beautiful film. It seemed as if it would never end. Yes, the two half brothers were very close, and I guess that made the film controversial, but most of the drama came from them being apart. It did make for a good movie, but nothing near as dramatic as one might expect."
5,My first choice,"Except when I have to play super, super quiet (for that I use the Peter Erskine ride sticks), these are the only thing I'll play. There's something about the weighting that makes them more responsive than other sticks, and the tip shape seems to sound great no matter what you're playing. The 'shoulder' of the stick, right where it meets the head, is tapered less and also is more gradual coming into the head itself, meaning that there's a slightly higher percentage of the stick weight up toward the head of the stick. I can't really say it better than they feel fast and precise. I even carry some in my car at all times just in case!"
1,Songs of Praise and Remembrance,"I was disappoined in this CD - the list of titles seemed to be songs I knew, but when I heard them, the titles had been assigned to different sets of words altogether, with which I was not familiar. And the one song I particularly wanted to hear was sung to a tune I didn't know and which I didn't think enhanced the song at all. This was How Great Thou Art."
2,Shipped Slowly,I was told there was over night shipping on this book which I requested. When it did not show up the next day I checked with the shipping company and they said it was sent 2nd day air. I phone Amazon and they confirmed there was no over night shipping. If I knew there was no over night shipping from Amazon I would have purchased it from another source because I needed it the next day.
2,baby phat tee,The fit is not accurate I have lots of baby phat tees and this one doesn't fit like others not worth buying unless your looking for tight fit
2,Just...Ok,"I got this book because of the reviews. But after reading itI had a few problems with the story. Things happen super fast between Michael & Libby. One minute Michael and Libby meet (hardly any conversation between the two) and the next he is in her bed in the middle of the night and she's ok with it, and so it goes with things happening between this two that hardly know anything about one anoher but act like they've know eachother for years (no explanation as how they got to that point). The dialogue between the two falls flat. I felt no connection between the two. It was almost boring."
4,A great resource,"James Robinson is a tremendously well-versed and insightful theologian. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Theology, so I've read a lot of his material - as well as those from other theologians. Robinson does a masterful job presenting some rather challenging concepts regarding Q. Though not comprehensive, this book is a ""must have"" for any serious scholar-wanna-be (like me) or others who are honestly interested in learning more about ""the greatest story ever told""!"
1,The Unconsoled,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It is like an awful date who doesn't know what they want in life and is unhappy with everything.At least with a date you can usually have a decent dinner, nod your head pleasantly and tune out. This book offers no similar escape options.Paragraphs often run on for pages and pages while a character thinks about something as mundane as whether or not a button is sewn onto a coat correctly and how an old man might feel about it.If you have time for a book like this, please take up something useful like knitting pneumonia vests for orphans. Several hours of my life are now lost forever."
3,Left wanting more. Again.,"I read 500+ pages waiting to find out WHY WHY WHY?!? I read voraciously, and it was tough to stop reading - the fastest 500 pages I've read in a long time - constantly wondering, WHY WHY WHY?!? And I was left without answers. Without LOTS of answers. I understand why the author did it. He is brilliant, and did convey a greater meaning (or at least, I found a greater meaning). But wow, he could have done that in 200 pages and I'd have been a lot less frustrated."
4,Masterpiece but boring,"This novel is a masterpiece when you realize what he has done all throughout the novel. I won't spoil it - it is worth the read to figure it out afterwords - they you are like wow. But the novel itself it a dry, boring, dreadful read. I had to really push myself to finish it and not put it down. The Remains of the Day is his best novel. This one is worth the read though to see the overall plot structure in the end. I am not sure how he kept everything straight as he wrote it."
2,Not his best,"Definitely not Ishiguro's best work. By the time I got to the end of this one, I didn't even care anymore."
2,Thank you for helping me give this up!,"It took me 3 weeks to get to page 192 of this novel. Noting that by page 192 (of 535) I still had no idea of what was going on, or supposed to be going on, I decided to read some reviews. I want to thank everyone who wrote reviews of this mess to help me set it aside and not waste any more time with it. I will not finish it. A frustrating mishmash of unconnected events. Myriads of characters looking for a plot. In 192 pages, not one creature with whom I could sympathize or care what happened to in the end.However, I gave it two stars because the style of the writing is interesting (even compelling), as is the leterary approach of describing the main character (Ryder) solely by how everyone else sees him. I just wish something had happened in the first 192 pages, or that someone's review -- and I read ALL of them -- gave me hope that something would happen in the remaining 343 pages. Thank you!"
4,A great approach to debugging,"Ms. Folsom has hit all of the salient points to debugging Visual FoxPro applications. And, surprise, she's also nailed the critical points about debugging any application.This book is a treasure for anyone who wants to professionally debug their application before inflicting it on the unsuspecting user. The author methidically details how to ensure that your application runs right and what to do when it doesn't. It's a must for any Visual FoxPro developer and a good read for any other developer."
5,Impressive despite low price,"I have had this lux meter for only a short while. But I am writing this now because I am most impressed. It is nicely designed and very well made. I almost did not order it because it was so low cost. That would have been a mistake.The short manual gives the specs, including the spectral response and accuracy. As you can see, the sensor is on a cord and can be aimed independent of the display unit. The LCD display is bright and easy to read.If I had to find a shortcoming, and to me this is minor, it is not auto ranging. One has to select the correct range to get the most accurate reading. But, for an instrument (and I do not use that term lightly) at $13.41, it is truly remarkable."
1,Didn't work,"I ordered it specifically for my sons science project and I didn't figure I would need to test it to make sure it worked so I left it in the box until it was time to do his project. Well a couple weeks went by and we did his project and the darn thing did NOTHING! That isn't to say it isn't a perfectly good meter. It is just the one I got didn't work. We turned it on and the display worked but it didn't do the readings like it was supposed to. But I see it got great reviews so it must be a great product, I just must have been one of the unlucky ones, bummer for us, it screwed up that part of his science project. :("
4,This is good.,"As a novice photographer, this works fine for me. Great price and it does what it supposed to. The good pricing means I don't worry about losing it."
1,Small fit,I wear an XL helmet. XL Bandana was too small off a fit. Appears designed for a child. I wouldn't recommend product.
4,nice sweat protector,this is nice to wear during the summer months.no problems with fitment.easily washable and able to dry quickly.enough said.thanks for reading
5,"Yes, no problems!",The product arrived fast and was exactly what I needed. I had no issues with this company. I will defiantly use them again in the furture.
4,"Beyond Revealing for some, a reminder for others","So often one comes across a piece of literature that asks for nothing from the reader, this is not one of those works.We are all guilty of branding and labeling, the point is that one examine oneself during the process so that we understand the meaning behind those labels. AS humans we have a tendency to use words in ways that make them meaningless or less powerful. Yet the implications are still evident and strong. So often we fall prey to the whimsy of the age we live in, yet Lessing implores us to look deeper. If you enjoy the metaphysical in literature and other Lessing works such as The Golden Notebook, then Prisons we Choose to Live Inside will be a riveting read. Please do not become discouraged by those who say this is a tough read (or scholarly), this book is a MUST read for those of us who are, or would like to become more self aware."
4,Kids are multilingual,"Can Indy speak many languages fluently? I would venture a guess ""yes"" given his education and life of globe hopping. Every kid I know where we live speaks at least 2 languages or is learning the second. Many speak 3 or 4. Their families have taken them globe trotting and they are called third culture kids or global nomads...kind of like Indy. In some ways my kids identify with him. Our family has enjoyed this series both on Armed Forces Network several years ago and now on video. We are all history buffs and enjoy a good adventure too. All are provided. The fun of the character, though not always true to life is a plus. Thanks to Lucas for entertaining and educating us both."
5,The most touching book I've ever read,This book is the best in my library of gay related books. I read a lot and this one I think is the one that I read most. I read it over and over and it keeps getting better every time. It seems that I missed something the first time I read this and then I read it again and picked up on other things and then I keep reading it and keep picking up on things that I missed. It's a good story of life of a gay man in the publics eye at all times.
2,Product Incomplete!,"I can't believe that no one else has complained about this but this product does not work completely without additional purchases (and expensive ones at that). It creates a situation where you have to buy extra plugins in order to play dvd files and even popular audio files. If you're thinking you can just copy your dvd or mp3 over and all is good, think again. The plugins are quite expensive too. On top of it all, if you buy the travel kit, you can't record full rez video without an additional (very expensive) product! Very disappointing.It's a nice product for watching movies but it's pretty poor on the audio side. It won't play music by album and it can't see iTunes' images (probably some other plugin they will sell you). Kinda sad because I placed my entire music collection on this thing so I could listen to it at work and can only enjoy it in shuffle mode. :("
4,Excellent tape,"It is difficult in my area to find a measuring tape reflecting meters, since we use yards and feet in the U.S. But for sports events such as long jump, etc., for organizations such as Special Olympics, meters is the official measure. I used it all winter and spring for such, and it held up nicely, and is easy to read. I recommend it for coaches."
4,Apex,Apex gives you more distance and ball doesn't drop. Easy to install only negative it does come with instructions on how to adjust the settings. You have to get a feel for it while you're shooting some paint.
4,Overall great,I have only been able to use it during 1 game. It worked great. It was very accurate and the distance was great. I look forward to playing with it again.
1,Poor poor quality!,Very funny looking book! Ridiculouse to be exact for a hardcover. The book is tiny with poor quality paper and font; seems shortened in the content. The regular size book is over 400 pages but this looks like a preteen version of the actual one. I have read this book before and wanted a nice hardcover for my library but didn't even attemp to read this to make sure the content is similar; it's that low quality. Don't waste your money.
2,A Life of its own,"Regardless what anyone thinks about aliens or their mode of transportation the entire concept has taken on a life of its own. Some of these concepts are very amusing as individuals try to use the controversy to push their personal philosophy on others. Some of my favorites are:They're here to punish us for throwing away aluminum cans and not recycling.They are bad, evil etc.They are good, nice, kind etc.They see us as a threat to the universe and want to exterminate us.We're their food.They want to mate with us because...They want to make us their slaves.As long as there is money to be made there will be movies about UFOs and aliens."
2,Doesn't work for me,"I am an average-sized woman, no problems with my back other than the usual, eight-hours-in-front-of-a-computer back pain, and this chair actually was harder on my back than a regular chair. After fifteen minutes, it just wasn't comfortable at all, and I found myself switching to an ordinary office chair. I tried adjusting the seat and it didn't help. Also--though I only used it regularly for a little over a month--the upholstery started looking a bit shoddy. Really wish I hadn't bought this."
3,BELLYDANCE & CHAKRAS,"First off, this is a lengthy DVD because of the instructional section and the dance flow is about 9 1/2 minutes. Going through each of the 7 chakras has interesting info, especially in how and what part of they body you should be focusing on when doing the movement. Visually, it's very low budget, but decent lighting and camera angles. The instructors were knowledgeable, but need to brush up on their presentation and public speaking skills-they looked so nervous, especially the heavier one. In general, it taught me about the 7 chakras and the bellydance aspect was interesting, but I don't think I'll be playing this DVD often."
1,Bizarre design flaw,"I bought this bed on the way home from the airport with my Dad. Comes with a pump, so no problem, right? Wrong! The pump doesn't run while plugged in--you have to charge the pump for 12 hours first, and then run it on battery. (Who in the world would design a pump that can't operate while plugged in? These people.) They don't tell you this on the box, of course, which meant my Dad slept on the couch and I returned this junk the next day."
5,Light Of the Stable.,I love Christmas music and Emmylou is one of my favorite singer. She does a beautiful job on this album. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Christmas music and is a fan of Emmylou Harris.
3,If it ain't broke...,"I really wish Emmylou had just gone and put together a whole brand new Christmas album and not tried to improve a perfect one. For me, the original issue is a 5-star classic: arrangements and sequence. I added this new one to my collection becuz I collect, no other reason."
4,Yet Another Good Book by Michaels,"While I read this book hungrily and bonded with all of the characters, the ending left me feeling disinterested. I agree with the reader from Maine that the story would have been much more interesting if told by Jim, to whom all the supernatural things are happening. It was still a good book, though, and I recommend it to any Barbara Michaels fan."
2,Android 18 vs. Bio-Blob. Sorry I mean Bio-Broly.,"Broly is back again...sort of. He has been brought back to life through advanced technology. This time he's more like a big blob monster or something. If you've seen the Blob or Godzilla versus the Smog Monster you can pretty much get an idea what Broly is like this time around. Trunks, Goten and Android 18 team up to fight the resurrected Broly. He's finally defeated. That's about it. This movie is honestly a waste. The Broly movies got progressively worse and finally ended here. I can't in good conscious recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of money and space on your shelf. There's nothing redeeming about it. You may as well keep on shopping."
1,Not worth the trouble.,I bought this hearing it was bad. Being a DBZ fan and having seen all the movies up to this one I thought hey how bad could it be. Well it made me regret the money I spent on it. If you must see it rent it or borrow it from someone they might just give it to you. Anyway the only reason I think someone should buy this is if they want to own all the DBZ movies or if you bought Triple Threat with all 3. The first 2 are a Godsend compared to this.
2,Worst DBZ movie yet!!!,"Maybe it's because Goten and young Trunks piss me off, but I didn't like this movie. The ""bio Broly"" made out of chemical mud...what was that??Should have called it, DBZ - Mud Broly.Watch for DBZ movie 12, comming soon. (This one will rock your world!!!)"
4,broly's revenge has been realized !,"I think this movie is awesome.in the beginng lord jaguar uses the blood sample to create a clone of broly to kill hercule,meanwhile hercule and 18#,goten,trunks are taken to the island where they fight jaguar's bio-warriors.jagur's mad and tries to awake bio-broly,goten and trunks find the tank and see bio-broly,they mistake him to be the real broly the legendary supersaiyan that goku helped destroyed in the past.they try to destroy the tank but bio-broly comes out and fights them but is knocked into acid and mutates will he win this revenge showdown,mabye not bio-broly starts getting his butt kicked by the saiyan children and is mad,goku comes down and helps our hearoes finish off the clone,but has a new mission,go to hfil and defeat broly,who escaped from prision now goku has to fight broly in one final rematch,can goku beat broly the saiyan from his past."
2,You have seen better,"I got the dub version 2 weeks before amazon got it and was disapointed. I love the fact that someone other then Goku saves the day but it was not even Broly, just a rich man's clone. I did not even see the trademark Broly clothesline(lol). Other reviewers tell you the story in it's entirety, not much to see but you got to see it if you are a fan, and have to collect it if you're like me. If a friend has it, then borrow it."
1,Not impressed,"The fit was terrible. I returned this item a month ago, and have yet to be credited. Based on that, I don't plan on purchasing anything else from this company."
3,Cute Boot.. Bad Fitting and Scratched Pair Received!,"I'll give Ariat this - these are very cute boots! But unfortunately, the calf area is HUGE!!! I'm ""average"" (5'5) and the boots fit perfectly on my feet, but I can easy fit two of my calves in the boot. It was absurd - I've purchased several pairs of boots before, but these are definitely the biggest boot opening I've seen!The pair I got were already scratched (they were quite visible) on different parts of both boots, like someone had almost tried them on and in the process, scratched the leather to ensure deep marks. Also, there were black stains on one of my boots. I didn't spend a $140 on these boots so I could received used goods and defective goods. Don't plan to order from Bare Bones again."
2,"Whoever gave this book 5 stars, Is a Rocky Mark!","No way is this book deserving of 5 stars. I am too a rocky fan. This book was ok at best. I felt it was way to short. He is writing his life's story and how old is he? 27. He just started life. He should have waited alittle longer. I gave foley's book 5 stars. I don't see how some of you people can give the rock's book 5 stars. It can't compared to foley's book at all. Buy the book if you are a Rocky mark, like some of you who gave it 5 stars."
3,Great book ruined by third person chapters,This is tale of two books. One is a straightforward biography which is a real page turner. The other is third person rants by The Rock about some of his matches which are horrible. I basically skipped entire chapters since they are basically the exact same things with a few names and dates changed. One the ghostwriter was thinking when he included this crap is beyond me. So enjoy the first 2/3 of the book because you WILL be let down by the end.
1,Can you Smell the Rock?,For anyone of this age to think he has led enough of a life to write a book must be crazy. maybe I was just spoiled after reading Mick Foley's book but this one had me falling asleep 3 pages into it.
2,Rock Out,"I avidly follow WWF Wrestling, and The Rock is my favorite stars. I am, in fact, one of the millions...AND MILLIONS of Rock's fans. But, the book is disappointing. Since reading it, I have found it hard to come to terms with the glaring differences between his character and his life. If you have a genuine interest in finding out all about your favorite wrestling superstar, great. Buy it. But if you want to keep looking at the Rock reverantly, clueless to what he is actually like, please don't read the book. I wish I hadn't."
2,The Rock should have broke out of characther,"The Book was excellent but the most electrify man in sports entertainment didn't write it, unlike Mankind who wrote his every page, but like I said if the Rock would have broke out of characther like Mankind did it would have added a different perpestive of the book to give you a feel of what the Rock is really like. But i would say buy it but defintely check out Mankinds book it gets a 5 star rating from me"
3,"Great Wrestler, And Entertainer..But The Book Falls Short","I love the Rock as that character he created himself, and Dwyane Johnson who has definitely crossed over as from wrestler to decent actor. However the book is good but it is not great as I hoped. Too much going in and out of character, at first it is hilarious...But after a few several times it is hard to take him serious and just confusing. If there is a great book to read from wrestlers, read Triple H's approach to a better body and Ric Flair's book. They are upfront real life stories and opinions that are genuine. I loved the Rock Says for the first few chapters and for the comedy he put into it..But bouncing around back and forth from character back to Dwayne Johnson just seemed Immature and had me lost."
5,I can smell what this book is cookin'!,"If you liked Mick Foley's book, then you'll love the poeple's champ's one. It rules! So all you jabroni's out there better buy this book!"
1,The Great One's Book is not that great!,"I was excited about receiving The Rock's Book until I read it. Too bad The Great One couldn't have wrote it. The book appeared to be written way out of context. According to the book, he went to college. Wonder why they didn't teach him to write?"
1,The Rock + Book = Not good,"I am a big wrestling fan and I greatly enjoyed Mick Foley's autobiography, but this is not only a bad wrestling book, it's just a bad book period. A great part of Have a Nice Day was the vivid descriptions of matches and such, but in this book most of Rock's best matches are all written in character, which is irritating and pointless. If you want to read a good book get Have a Nice Day but don't waste your money on this."
2,Ugh,"I thought this was an autobiography. This book is ghostwritten.And why did The Rock ""write"" a book when he was only 27 and has only been a pro wrestler for three years upon the writing of this book? This was just a cash-in for the WWF and The Rock. They saw the success of Mick Foley's book and figured that if their most (or second most) popular wrestler had a book, it would sell, too. Ditto for Chyna's book."
4,"Very good book, I enjoyed alot",I thought the book was very well written and I learned alot about the Rock and his family life I didn't know before. Also the book talks alot about the wresteling matches he has been in and his views and opinions on those matches. He tells alot about how things are beind the scences. I liked the book as a whole and the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because he could have waited a little bit more into his career so he would have had an even better book with more things to talk about. Well thank you for listening to my opinion. Way to go Rocky!
5,THE BEST DARN BOOK EVER!!!,"THIS BOOK IS SO FUNNY AND INTERESTING!!!I LOVE THE BOOK I HAVENT READ THE WHOLE THING YET BUT I WILL BECAUSE ITS SO GOOD!!!!i JUST BOUGHT THE NEW WWF VOLUME 5 CD!! iT IS SO COOL!N~e~WAYS mY FAVORITE CHAPTER IS THE ONE ABOUT OWEN HART AND THE ONE ""THE PEOPLES PUBERTY"" THAT ONE IS SO FUNNY! iF YOU HAVENT READ IT YET YOU HAVE tOO!!!wELL I GOTTA GO !!!!"
5,it's the best,hello everyone this was the best book I have ever read the details are the best and by coincidence it was by one of the best famous people in the world well see ya later
3,"Another Africa ""hotel memoir"" by a journalist... who cares?","Let's hope this is the last book by a journalist in Africa who writes about what they saw happen outside their hotel window. This book is not uninteresting, but I'm tired of reading about journalists' relationships with their hotel receptionists and their taxi drivers. Are we supposed to think they are so special because they drank beers at hotel bars, and saw bad men drive by outside? Do we really need constant descriptions of their expatriate friends and colleagues? Wrong is the latest journalist to suffer the delusion that her experience is more interesting than those of the people in the townships and villages. The real stories of the Congo are a long walk from Ms Wrong's comfort zone... too bad we don't get to read much about them in this book."
4,Blinding Bright LED solution,"I had one of these, it broke after 3-4 years of light use. So ordered another one but seems the power supply unit was broken. (so returned that).Researched little more spent more than double and bought 1202FX model.I am writing the review to suggest to others about the bright blue LED. This problem of blinding bright light exists on all models. Here's a work-around:Either cover the LED with a paper and use glue of tape to stick it or use a drop on acrylic or other paint on top of the LED, spread evenly on the LED.Hope this helps until Behringer can figure out to use ""diffused blue LED"""
3,Mixer,"I quess its alright, but for my use, I find it was really not needed. But I might find a use for it some day.Maybe its just not enough control for a the mix I was looking for."
2,Behringer Mixer,can't adjust it properly. But sounds ok! Would not recommend it to anyone. The shipping was great got it in two days and didn't have to pay for faster delivery. Thanks Amazon
1,"Decent Mixer, if you don't mind NOISE","I tried two different of these mixers (sent one back, and am keeping the other), and both give horrible amounts of extra noise on the Mic in plug, especially when using a Condenser mic that requires Phantom Power. I have a different Behringer mixer (Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQs) that introduces much less noise than this one (but still not perfect). Its a soothing white noise in the treble range for those who like it.All other parts of the mixer works great, line inputs give no noise. Perfect for mixing together two other pieces of equipment (Guitar, Tape Deck, etc..) but not microphones.You get what you pay for, so don't expect a silent Mic Pre on this one."
2,Cheaply Made,"This was a gift for a cousin who wanted to just get a signal into his computer for recording. It works just fine for someone starting out, but for someone more experienced, hopefully you'd already have the brains to not buy from Behringer. They're not well known for pro-audio like others such as Sennheiser, PreSonus, Focusrite, etc. They're for beginners."
3,Good but some drawbacks,"A decent little mixer, which handles a variety of inputs and is very portable. Its been working perfectly. Great!Not so great? it comes with a blue Power light which is WAY too bright. In a dim bar or living room, I was blinded when I went to adjust the levels. I had I put a couple tiny dollops of Elmers on it and that helped dim it but still, in a low light, its like looking into oncoming headlights. More overpowering than it needs to be.A major drawback is there is no power switch! Plug it in to turn it on, unplug it to turn it off. A pain in the neck,even if you dont plan on moving it around much.For the price and the size, not a bad deal, but comes with some baggage."
4,okay mixer,"This is an okay mixer, simple and straight forward. Nothing more. Although I have some problems with the channel 1 input. I had to turn it all the way up to hear anything from the microphone. If I turn it down a little, it just goes away. I've tried with all my mikes, all does the same thing. Not sure if this is my problem, or the mixer's problem. Still a good value."
3,Great Fun!,"I love the ""board,"" I love the stones and their little bags. I'm wondering though why I bought the four-person version because I can't see playing it with more than one person."
4,Great Game - Package needs work,"I love this game. The board is high quality and soft, thicker than I expected. The glass beads are plentiful, and most are good. A few were doubled or chipped. My college roommate had an older version of this game, which was better. This game board is a little too thick (or the cylinder too thin), making it impossible to put the bead bags back into the cylinder once the board is in. The only way to put the game away is to tightly wrap the game board around the 4 bead bags first, then you can slip the whole thing into the cylinder. Its a only minor issue, but I would prefer a wider cyclinder with some wiggle room. Other than that, the game is great."
2,Service,Service was too quick not giving consideration for anyone to change their mind in purchasing. Because all of the seasons were not available I changed my mind and tried to cancel order within minutes. This was not a possibility with you and that is not acceptable. Service was too quick which for some people is okay.
5,Finally!,This was a great suprise xmas gift for a friend who has been longing for this second season to be put on DVD.
5,RAW IS THE BEST,Raw is the best and i mean the bestthe opening of November 7th RAW was awesomeSmackDown! just sucksTeddy Long is useless. Why did Vince bring him in?Paul Heyman was much better or he can just put Steph to be the new SmackDown! General ManaherThanks Eric you are the bestAnd u stupid people stop booing Eric. Why dont you boo Teddy insteadEric is gonna beat Teddy's skinny @$$
3,not agian,"man this was a great ppv but gould have been way better and i hoppe that wwe starts making the greatest ppvs . just like they have been doing in 02 why wwe .look for some legend matches so it can happenlike rock vs brock 2.hogan vs scsa.batista vs scsa.rock vs hhhhbk vs rvd.angle vs the rockangle vs austinhogan vs rock. like wreslmaniapart 3.man these matches would be great .but even better if youbrought back some legends or some huge namesman and i hope wwe. can find goldberg so he can fightlesnar in a rematch, godness. to topple that flop at wm.and maybe wwe should put more matches that people wannasee in one ppv.like this will be a great cardhogan vs scsabatista vs goldberghhh vs the rockeddie vs r.kohbk vs r.v.dkurt angle vs kanecena vs scott stiener or nash.man wwe think. that will have thousand of asses in seat."
2,THE UNDERTAKER,"Don't buy it, it will really make you dissapointed. JBL still sucked, he isn't my favortie wrestler because I really hate him. When will JBL lose? I don't know but Smackdown has been bad show since JBL came out to be a champ. Aramgeddon is only 2 stars. The legendrary superstars are Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant, Ultimate Warrior, Roddy Piper, Ludvig Borga, Mick Foley, Steve Austin, Ric Flair, Legion of Doom, and The Undertaker. My favorite wrestler in many legend only the Undertaker and Hogan( they are famous), and twice Kane and Brock Lesnar.( but the most is Classic Undertaker then Undertaker then Hogan, and then Kane then Lesnar). And now UT is in his old school, I much like him.MICHAEL GUNN PORTLAND"
5,Love it.,"This has lasted me two years and it works like a charm. Get it, you will not regret it. I love it."
3,"Try it for the twelve string, keep it for the six.","Good concept and design for quick change action. May work well for the six string, but definitely is inadequate in clamping down the highs on a twelve string (tested on a Seagull Coastline S12). Most 12 strings are high tension, which sets high demands on capo choices. On a side note, thePlanet Waves NS Capo - Silverfrom Planet Waves has worked fine for the twelve string."
5,Worth the money,"Great capo for small hands. The squeeze is easier then all others. Easy to maneuver. My daughter had a hard time with other types, this has a finger squeeze."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"I have tried to purchase this item twice from two separate vendors on Amazon. Both times the CD cover and the disc labels were as advertised, but both times it turned out to be a performance of Tannhauser, not Tristan. I don't know what is going on here but potential buyers should be aware that there are mislabeled CDs out there."
5,Fabulous guide,This is a really insighful and helpful guide through the sometimes confusing and daunting process of picking a private school and getting your children in.It's great moral support too and very entertaining reading!
1,this does not cover the LA South Bay area,"I thought this would be a comprehensive overview of LA area private schools. However, it does not cover the South Bay area (beach cities + Torrance + Palos Verdes), which is what I need. Probably great if you live between Santa Monica and Glendale."
2,This book is inaccurate and biased,"As a parent really interested in this topic, I was very disappointed to find out that key information in this book was inaccurate -- one example is the review of a school that moved two years ago, the author lists the new address and then reviews the school in the OLD location! I've visited several of the schools and started to see a pattern of bias very quickly. Unfortunately, I don't really trust this resource given the major inaccuracies, but wish there were an accurate reference to help parents navigate through the many options."
5,WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!,"I HAVE NEVER!! EVER!!! purchased a cd THIS AWSOME!! i could not stop dancing with BURRITO SABANERO!!!once again the hermanos moraarriaga!!proofs one more time they are THE best!! the first time i had heard them was in the mtv unplugged with SHAKIRA!!and then with Pilar Montenegro in ""quitame ese hombre"" and Jeniffer peña in ""El dolor de tu presencia"" O BOY!!! THIS CDIS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!! Kathy new jersey"
3,What're you laughing for? It's not that funny.,"I watched this a few weeks ago at my uncle's house and I cannot understand why this is funny.They ridicule other cultures,employ cheap stereotypes, and laugh at genuine human pathos and loneliness. How and why is that funny?"
1,A kitchen counter dust collector....,"I purchased this product because my husband is a huge fruit eater and I felt it would be a good product for him to have. However, it wasn't. The fruit gets moldy. Not rotten, but moldy. We used it for about a month. We are now going to try the new green bags. Cheaper, takes up less space and worth the try."
3,Fresh Sealer 3 gal.,I love it at first but did not have it long before a piece broke off causing a leak. By that time I had lost all the papers on it so I just gave it away. Not sure what they used it for. If you often have a lot of fresh veggies this is great!
1,"iTouchless Fresh Sealer, NOT Recommended","I was very enthused about this purchase, and after reading the 2 positive reviews, I was convinced this would be a good buy. After receiving the item, reading the directions in the booklet that comes with it, I put fruit in it, and was then very disappointed in the results. Food spoiled very quickly for me in the sealer, I was very frequently opening it to dry out moisture that accumulated. Also, there seemed to be quite a bit of heat inside the sealer. The only food that seemed to do well in it was tomatoes. Cherries and grapes molded very quickly, as did bell peppers. We talked w/the manufacturers about the product, got a fax with a few additional instructions but were still not happy w/the product. I am pleased w/Amazon's great customer service and return policy. That part of the transaction went well."
1,no happy,i still hadnt got this item and im upset because i was suppose to get it on tues or wedn but nothing
5,Great resource,"I purchased this book for my friend recently. He has been out of school for nearly 10 years now but has found this book extremely easy to use and understand. Even with his very short attention span, he manages to spend an hour or more a session going through this book multiple times a week. Based on the progress I've seen him make, I would DEFINITELY recommend this book to anyone looking to brush up or even teach themself the skills necessary to pass the GED. This is an excellent resource."
3,Electronic Lawn Mower,Kids played with Lawn Mower for a day or two but lost interest fast. The Lawn Mower now resides in my basemnet in the Land of Misfit Toys.
3,..Too CUTE Lawnmower....Just Open Package and Have Fun!,This was of many gifts for my youngest Grand-son for Christmas. He absolutely loves to push (mow the carpet) and the sounds are delightful even though the sounds only last about 15 seconds...He hasn't had it long enough to determine how it will do outside. If your little one likes push toys then this is the one to buy!...So Cute with the John Deere theme...
2,No Instrumental,"Since 2006 on the debut on the ""The Mouse and the Mask"" album, ""Old School"" has been considered one of my favorite tracks. I decided to try to find a single of the song to include the song as well a instrumental version as well. Receiving the CD recently, I found out that there is no instrumental version and only exist on the vinyl version. Love the song, but disappointed there is no CD version of the instrumental."
4,A Cuban Throwback,"The big '59 Cadillac tailfin on the cover of MAMBO SINUENDO should have been a hint: though mostly recorded in Havana Cuba, this is not another Buena Vista Social Club-type recording, though a few tunes hint at that.What MAMBO SINUENDO is, actually, is something of a throwback to the 'exotica' records of the 1950s and 60s.Some Latin percussion and rhythms are coupled to Hawaiian sounds: throw in surf guitar and you have a great 'lounge' recording to contribute to the mood."
3,"Sorry, this one's a snoozer","What IS all the hype about? These mediocre instrumentals frankly put me to sleep--making this a dangerous CD to listen to when driving. First track shows promise but the rest are no more than pleasant background music, not memorable."
1,"a waste of time, money, and talent","well, wes borland was the last remaining member of LB that i actually had faith in. that was until i saw the big dumb face video and went into seizures. the pain of sitting through that ...was unbearable. That along with the rest of the cd, that we got our hands onto through our college radio station, proves that any member of LB can do whatever he wants and MTV and the general pubic with sell it and buy it respectively. the truly unfortunate thing is there are great bands of all kinds out there that deserve a shot and bands like BDF and LB are stopping that from happening. if you want to check out an awesome band and you like punk try the sloppy meateaters on for size, their new cd forbidden meat, blew me away when i heard it."
5,Excellent!,"From Planeta Journal - Excellent! Finally a guidebook that makes visual identification and explanation its goal. Hundreds of color photographs illustrate the book. There are 3-D aerial-view layouts of towns and ancient sites, cutaways and floor plans for churches and pyramids. Sections include Mexican Muralists, Paseo de la Reforma, El Tajin and Antojitos (Appetizers), among many others."
5,The best I've seen,"I've been to Mexico twice, and I'm in love with it. I was planning a special short trip on Easter week this year, but because of personal reasons I couldn't go. In my frustration, I went to the book store and looked at every guide about Mexico, and to my surprise, this was the most complete. The rest were just text. I bought it inmediately, and while I read it I traveled without leaving home. The most importante feature is the abundance of pictures.If you are planning to travel to Mexico, or just enjoy learning about other countries, this book should be part of your collection."
5,"If you do animal rescue, you need this book!","This hasn't been updated for the newer medications but is still my ""go to"" book when I have questions. I would love a newer version but I have so many notes in my old copy that I would have to carry forward! If you do animal rescue, you need this book."
2,its helpful,I cant believe I ordered this book as when I checked my library; I already had it there LOL
3,Nice,America performs the title track plus Man's Road and In The Sea. All the material was written by Jimmy Webb. Nicely done.
3,Delightful music,"The music from this movie is wonderful, but I can only give it three stars because it came to me with a cracked case, and a scratched disc. If I hadn't lost my paperwork, I would have returned it for another."
4,GREAT FOR SMALL AMP,"I happen to like the sound of my Fender Champ cranked, and this stand does just the job. I attach a gooseneck and an sm-57, put it through the p.a., and I'm in business! Just be careful of the weight of your amp. 30-40 pounds should be max. I cracked one with my Super 112, which was about 60+ pounds. Nice and compact, folds right up into my gig bag."
2,In Love and War,"The first part of this film was simply an episode of the original TV series, but it is quite funny. The scene wherein Indy and a young Ernest Hemingway duel for the affections of a lovely Italian maid by simultaneously playing musical instruments with great gusto is hillarious. I agree with another reviewer that Jay Underwood is a pleasing Hemingway, but maybe less realistic than O'Donnell's haughty and more cynical Ernest. As for ""the best swordfight ever"", the viewer from USA should check out such dueling classics as Scaramouche (with Stewart Granger and Mel Ferrar) and the more recent Rob Roy (with Liam Neeson and Tim Roth) for truly first-class swordplay. If you like the Young Indy series, though, see Attack of the Hawkmen, the best of the bunch."
2,background music,"This album makes nice background music, but it's just not rhythmically interesting enough to listen to by itself.If you have limited exposure to international beats then it might be just your thing, but compared to Talvin Singh or DJ cheb i sabbah (for instance), the fusion between the two styles of music is rather dull."
3,this collection works,"If you want a good representation of most of the real Osmond hits, including Donnie, Marie, Donny & Marie, and the whole set of brothers, they're here; however, I'd like to have seen 'Long Haired Lover from Liverpool' by Little Jimmie; although it only hit number 38 on billboard, it was a #1 record in the UK."
2,What r they talkin abt?,"After going through all the the other reviews, I'm wondering if there are two different versions of this set. Only few others have mentioned about the bad recording quality. Well ... I must have the bad one. This set is of the absolute worst quality in my whole collection. It replaces the Bach Cello suites by Casals from 1930's recording.The sound is muted. The sound stage is clumped in the middle. The strings are barely audible. I have a decent sound system and am very particular about the recording. I couldn't get through the 'Classical' sym, let alone the others.Gergiev, LSO, Barbican Center, Philips: in case anyone wonders."
4,Agnes and her family will win your heart,"This reads like a long short story. The language in parts surprised me at first but then it became just part of the story. In this novel, the reader meets Agnes' parents...how they met, how they married, how they fell in love. They have two children: Agnes and Dolly. Tragedy strikes and more hardships arise. Agnes has to grow up quicker than her age as she is faced with tough life situations.Likeable characters and certainly does make the reader interested in the other books in this series."
4,just great,"I had read the book of The Browne Boys, etc and loved them, this is also a book of The Brownes, Just teriffic and captivative reading"
3,Mercedes Mom,I like the monitor but I don't like the fact that it squeals when you turn it up to a certain volume. I would do some more reserach on more monitors if you don't want this problem.
2,Dead after a year,"I liked this monitor for the most part--the sound quality was okay and the static was minimal. But after a year (of not that much use!), it died. I was very disappointed, now having to get another one to use for my second child."
3,Works great for about a year.,This is the second one I have owned and both after about a year have horrible static when turning it on. The reception up to that point was outstanding.
3,Monitors depend on the house,"Look monitors are a tricky business...I used to live in an apartment where this monitor was great...no problems. We moved and I began to get static and lots of problems. So I took the monitor back (used and they took it)...and bought me a Sony, that was a great machine it worked perfectly, until I tried it in my mother's house then it was a piece of crap. The associate at Babies R Us told me that baby monitors depend on the house and it is a trial and error thing...the only thing she recomended was more that 900mhz and more than one channel (I agree with her...thanks to babies r us and their employees)"
4,check out a new brand,"I loved this monitor for the first year, but the battery started not holding a charge through the day. And now the battery dosen't work at all. I called Fisher Price and they told me that the battery and the monitor was discontinued and there was nothing that they could do. I should have known better to but Fisher Price since this is the second monitor that I have had in 3 years. I went to Radio Shack and they told me they had no replacement and that FP probably has a company make 1 battery for each monitor. That's Fisher Price way to get you to spend more money. I have passed e-mails on to many of my pregnat friends to consider another brand."
1,Volume control noisy,"We've had this product for about 18 months. The monitor itself is great - reception, range and ability to hear our little one breathing is perfect.The only problem we've had is the volume control goes bad. We are on our second one and both the first and second one developed the same problem within 8 months. Whenever you try to turn up or down the volume you get a VERY loud static noise. Loud enough to wake the baby! Fisher Price has been accommodating - we've had to send them the defective one twice and each time they return us a $40 Fisher Price voucher. A pain to send back, but at least they honor the product.Needless to say the annoyance has been bad enough to give one star. With our latest return, we're not going to be purchasing a Fisher Price model."
3,Okay for the money,"After reading several reviews I registered for this monitor. However, I am quite disappointed. The monitor tends to get a terrible high pitched hum and the cordless piece eats batteries quickly. I would say I go through a set of batteries every two weeks and that is with keeping the unit plugged in over night and only using the cordless feature during the day. I even turn it off when the baby is not in his room, which is a good part of the day. It is a shame because I really thought this would be a quality piece."
1,Disappointed,All I got from this monitor was static. I returned it and bought the monitor from Sony. The Sony monitor has been crystal clear!
3,"Loved it for a while, but . . . .","I received this monitor as a baby shower gift just over a year ago. I am now expecting my second child in approximately 3 weeks and the monitor no longer works. We thought the rechargeable battery pack just needed to be replaced so we called Fisher-Price to order the replacement pack and they NO LONGER CARRY THEM. The customer service rep. suggested Radio Shack who also did not carry the battery pack, so we ended up going to a battery store and having it made. The remade rechargeable battery pack did not bring the monitor back to life so therefore we are looking for another monitor. If you are only having one child and plan on waiting a while in between for a second then this might be the monitor for you, but if you are planning on having children close together, I would pick another monitor instead. We are currently shopping for another monitor and may switch from a Fischer-Price to a Sony model that has received excellent reviews."
2,Static alert,"I really loved this monitor since I am hard of hearing. It vibrates when my baby makes any noise and I can hear really well with it. However, after about 6 months, it started to static whenever I touch the volume control/dial. Static was so loud. I called Fisher Price and I had to fight to get new one. They agreed to give me a new one but I got a used one in the mail! It was all stratched up. I called them and they immediately send me a check to get a new one. Now I had my 2nd monitor for 6 months and I am having the exact same problem again. I am disappointed about that. In addition, I don't like the fact I have to keep replacing the batteries every 3 days. So the only thing I like about this product that it vibrates and Fisher Price are the only company that makes this."
2,good at first...then broken irrepairable,"We got this as a gift and used for about one year. It was very clear with no static...then the monitor just kept on dying for no reason. When it was plugged in, when it was using the rechargable batteries---fisher price did nothing to help stating that the monitor was out of warranty. One would think one could get more than a year's worth of use from a monitor. Don't buy it or one like it."
2,"Good at first, disappointing later","We have had this receiver for almost 10 months, and at about 9 months every time you tried to adjust the volume a loud fuzz noise was produced on BOTH ends of the unit. So, while your little one is sleeping it might wake them up! I just went out a bought a new one today, because I can't take it anymore. Also, the problem with the volume control also made it where it only worked at the higher volume levels. The static sound would not allow you to listen to at the lower volume. And we do not live in a cramped area, we are in a normal family suburban home. Hope this helps!"
5,Great unit.,"This unit works great, I have tried 5 other different types and brands and this by far works the best.Be aware that 900 mhz is subject to interference just like any other wireless transmitter/receiver. Although the 900 mhz is less prone to this than the other 48 mhz units. This may not work for some people hence the bad reviews.Also this is a newer model, there was another model that looks just like this that was replaced in 2002. So please look at new current reviews.As this is a great unit that is extremely sensitive."
2,Not as funny as people have been saying!,"This book has been recommended in Catholic circles for some time, so I finally purchased it. I shouldn't have. I was very disappointed. I didn't even crack a smile, until the chapter on trying to pray the rosary with children. That one was hysterical! Still, it is only a few pages out of the book. I think the reason it falls flat is because it is so impersonal. You never feel involved with the family. Most stories are too vague (the children don't even have names) and focus on the setting more than the people. I know there are a lot of glowing reviews here, but you'll probably be happier with another book."
2,Did not fit properly,These tanks did not fit properly. Too big on top and too tight on the bottom?? Sent them back. Also did not like the material.
2,Very Outdated,This book doesn't have very good information for a new designer. The author's explanations of concepts are not clear. I didn't find this book helpful at all. You can find a lot of the information online for free. This book is not worth the cost.
4,Enjoyed it but it needed some structural work,"What struck me is that the authors don't tell the reader why they go into John Dee and the many others who tangled with this manuscript. From the title, one thinks it is a book about Roger Bacon and the manuscript but instead the first three quarters of the book is about scientific thought in the Middle Ages.This would be OK but the writers need to draw a line to its relevance to the Bacon/manuscript connection and they never did.So--they either need to change the title or adjust their framework.I'll read their other books, though. Their writing flows and they know how to make history entertaining.NJCher"
5,A scientific survey and examination of its lasting effects,"In 1912 one Wilfrid Voynich, a London rare book dealer, discovered a strange manuscript in a secluded Italian castle written in cipher which stymied code-breakers up to modern times. No, the Goldstones haven't broken the code: what they have done in The Friar And The Cipher: Roger Bacon And The Most Unusual Manuscript In The World is to provide a history of its possibilities and along with it, a scientific survey and examination of its lasting effects. The Goldstones use Roger Bacon, possible author of the manuscript, as a focal point for a history of the man, his times, and the evolution of code in response to an effort to keep evolving scientific pursuits secret from the church. A captivating survey emerges."
5,"If you only have time to read one book about writing, this is it!","Read the first part of this guide while you're writing your book, ideally before you begin. The second part will direct your marketing efforts. The book is a stimulating read: both practical and compelling. It offers ideas, then explains them, and finally gives examples. There were also lots of sensible recommendations for further reading. I finally realized I was spending more on phone calls to a friend, who is also a beginning writer, than the book costs. So, I shipped him a copy with the help of Amazon. We still discuss favorite parts. I have read countless books on writing. So far, this one's the best."
5,A Terrific Finish to the Series...,"I have enjoyed sharing Ashley's adventures, and I'm sorry to say goodbye now that I've finished book three which ended on a definite high note. Billerbeck's ability to deftly intertwine laugh-out-loud scenes and witty dialogue while pulling at the heart strings with a sweet love story makes for great reading."
3,No one mentioned this is a Christian book...,"I liked the theme of this book, but when I got about 20 pages into it, I realized it was a Christian book. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I would have liked to know ahead of time.There is a lot of talk about church, God and Christianity.I wasn't turned off, per se, but more annoyed this was not marketed as something the book contained."
5,A must-read for all sales people,"Whether you're a first-year rookie or a seasoned pro, Heat Up presents proven-to-work strategies for connecting with all types of prospects. It's concise, entertaining and filled with relevant examples. As I was reading, I imagined seasoned pros digesting the material and thinking, ""I've known this stuff for years, but I'm not practicing a lot of it. I'd better start."" So, for established sales professionals, this book is a terrific refresher-and provides a kick in the butt. For rookies, it's a road map to successful phone selling. If sales newcomers follow the author's advice, they'll learn how to prospect correctly from the outset, saving years of frustration."
4,Good and not so good. Probably only for die hard All/Descenents fans....,"The Descendents/ALL are among my FAVORITES in my whole collection of CDs (and I do have a TON!).But if you are just getting into the Descendents of ALL I would suggest that you look for a different album. For me, any album from the Descendents or ALL can put a smile on my face but this one is definatetly not as good as others such as ""Allroy's Revenge"" or ""I Don't Want To Grow Up"" etc....But the one thing that does make this album special is that it contains the song ""Dot"", which is one of ALL's greatest songs, in my opinion. I always go back and forth on who I prefer in ALL; Scott Reynolds, Chad Price, or Dave Smalley. This one is Scott's last. If I am in a Scott mood, then I would probably play all three albums, including this one. But again, for DIE HARD fans.peace,Kurt Isobe, Laguna Niguel, CA"
5,Hitachi Cordless Impact Wrench,This is a very useful tool on our farm. Use it almost daily. Don't know how we did without it.
5,Quality product,Bought this unit for a Mechanic friend.Great item to help a mechanic save time in the workshop.High powered unit.Highly recommended for the DIYer and the Workshop.Probably going to order one for myself as well.
5,Limited Edition Compact Disc...,"... of 2000 copies, score composed by Franz Waxman.The Disc by Varese Sarabande contains 14 Tracks, including the famous ""Blue Moon"" (composed by the great Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart).Well - its a Franz Waxman score - don't miss it!!!!"
1,Don't buy what the textbook already gives you,"The explanations of the problems in the 7th Edition textbook are accurate, as they should be, since both are by Keller. Problem is, the answer guide only gives you answers to the odd-numbered problems - answers to the same problems are in the back of the textbook this is intended to accompany!! Total ripoff.I'm glad I bought this used and only paid a few dollars."
5,Bravo!,"About three or four years ago, when I was trying to update my cd collection of Oregon, (my record albums were long gone), I noticed that several of the reviews for ""Oregon in Moscow"" were not very enthusiastic, so opted for other Oregon recordings. Then, just recently, at a local store, I saw the Moscow set on sale, and couldn't resist the bargain price. Well, after one listen, I could have kicked myself for paying any attention to those early negative reviews.The orchestral venture for Oregon's compositions was an amazingly, natural fit. It was like having heard a jazz chamber group with Eastern and Western influences for all these years, suddenly, have a symphony orchestra around them. With the orchestra, I was not only able to hear the beauty of those old sounds, but new influences, as well, like Villa Lobos and Bartok. Anyway, the result is truly memorable and one whose beauty you will want to listen to, again and again."
3,Not quite what I expected,"When I bought this, I had questions about the degrees of glory and was hoping that this would answer them through revelation, but it didn't.This book clarifies some things from the scriptures, if you need the clarification, but it also gives his own interpretation of the scriptures.One problem I have with it is that in the middle, he says some pretty racially bigottous things that are unbecoming an apostle of Christ.Is it worth the money? That is up to you, but there are many LDS books even cheaper than this one which can teach you more without making you wonder."
5,Greatly apprediated!,I enjoyed having access to this book on my Kindle. I enjoy the content and your willingness to put LDS information on Kindle. Thank you!
4,Hokey Cover - Good Old Movie,"They say you can not tell a book by its cover. The same goes for this dvd. The cover looks a bit hokey. However, I enjoyed the movie which was made during the WW2 war years."
4,An Excellent Book on Technique,"This book taught me the basics of cooking Indian food. The first few chapters alone were worth the full price of the book. Although my favorite Indian cookbook is Jaffrey's ""An Introduction to Indian Cooking"" (the spice combinations in Jaffrey's recipes are superb), Sahni does a better job of organizing and explaining the fundamental techniques. The recipes are less complex than those in Jaffrey's book, but sometimes Sahni's simplicity is a welcome change. Lastly, all recipes can be prepared with much less fat than called for, but the onions will not brown well."
4,Fast arrival,"I was really surprised to see how fast the DVD arrived. Although the price was spicy, the movie is very good and the quality of the DVD is impeccable. Moreover, I need to say that I am very glad as an Amazon client."
4,Great Book,"This book is great for science lovers, environment lovers, or good literature lovers. You'll love this easy-to-read book which teaches us humans as a whole to love and try to care for our environment. I strongly recommend you buy it!"
5,Grand Unification Theory,"Mick Turner and Will Oldham mesh perfectly on this short (~23 min) album. The music is heavily influenced by Turner, who's unique style of harmonium, loops, and noodling employed on the Tren Brothers EP really shines under Oldham's signature sing-speak. Although there is no percussion, the rhythmic wash of Turners looped strumming creates a soothing, languid flow. An excellent diversion for those waiting for a sophmore Tren Brothers album, and a nice addition to Oldham's impressive discography..."
4,The only toy baronyx out there,"Since a fossil of the real bayronyx was discovered in the early 1990s, this is the only toy version of the fish-loving dinosaur that I've found. It is fairly well detailed, with plenty of colors painted on it, and it stands up easily. My son loves to bring it in the tub as he pretends it is there to catch a yummy fish."
5,The Bomb!!!,"Wow!!The fact that this is guy is pretty much an unknown speaks volumes to our issues as a society. Sachal is great. His voice is well trained and inticing. The CD is great start to finish. I will definitely be looking for him in concert. Try it, you just might like it."
4,I like this knife,"I also got the larger 10 inch knife as well, I like both an would recommend it highly. They keep a sharp edge and are easy to clean. As an added benifit they look great in my kitchen."
5,Nice Knife!,"I don't usually like the Shun handles on there larger knives, but with the smaller ones in the line I think they actually become much more comfortable for people with larger hands. The edge retention is spot on and I can keep this knife scary sharp!"
5,My favorite book of all time!,"Even though I first read this book years ago, I always think about it as I choose the different paths in my life. The main character in this book and her three lives are so believable that they will haunt you forever! I keep searching for more books like this but it is one of a kind indeed. Don't miss it."
3,"Technically competent, yet unsatisfying","I had heard many good things about this novel. Anshaw is a fine writer and many of the descriptions of situations and feelings are well-done. However, I just never became very interested in Jesse, the ""heroine"". Part of the theme of the book is that Jesse reached her peak at the 1968 Olympics and everything after is just epilog, but I still wish the book had helped me connect with her more. The three part structure is a clever concept and I especially enjoyed the parallels between Jesse's universes in the first and second sections. Still, I never felt that Jesse was a particularly interesting or likable character. That's a big problem in a book like this where so much of the book is focused on one character."
2,A little disappointed...,I absolutely love my Hitachi Personal Massager and was thrilled to get these attachments along with it.I tried the attachments a couple of times and then just gave up on them.I'm going to eventually try them out again and see if I can get some use out of them.
2,not much here,really not much here -- just a demo game -- 10th edition starter set was better -- more cards and instructions
2,So much arrogance,"Logan, who sees himself above the petty meanness of the ACF, becomes exactly the person he said he never would. He deserves the ACF and all the crap that goes with it. This is yet another book where sketchy people are rewarded for their bad behavior, be it Logan or his various senior associates in the snake pit."
4,Average Keyboard,"This keyboard is just for your normal work to get it done. Overall, the keyboard buttons are not crispy and the mouse is too big to hold in palm."
3,"Nice setup, but mouse was broken - undisclosed refurb.?","Nice keyboard. I like the keys that open up the calculator, iTunes, Outlook, etc. However, when I ordered it through Amazon, the right mouse button did not work and the mouse has a big scratch on it. I suspect this ""new"" item is a refurb. Buyer beware. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. It's going back today."
3,Good but...,"These mints are really good, good enough I went to order more but for some reason they've gone up $4.40 from $14.44 since I ordered in late December. They are good, but not that good."
1,THIS BOOK IS TRASH AND NOT LITERATURE,"The content of the book was rediculas. The profantity shows a lack of communication skills. Lee Smith's vacabulary must be quite limited. I was required to read this book in my college English class. I know college students should be grown up and mature, but this offended me. I would rather read a book that could have taught me good moral standards than to spend my time reading a book that is of no use other than a class requirement."
3,Good start but disappointing end,"I read this book based on a newspaper article and went out right away and bought it. It had all the makings of a good, Southern novel--family quarrels, death and secrets. As I got to the end, it was hard to keep track of who was related to whom and how others fit into the story. It was almost as if they were thrown in as the story began to wind down, just to give some resolution. I hated the ending; I think Smith the cowardly way out and never really answered some of the pressing questions. I've heard that this is not Ms. Smith's best work but I would be willing to try another novel by her"
3,"Good love story, poor editing","Rebecca Cullen is 24 years old and struggles to support her two brothers and her grandfather. She is determined to do it all without asking for anyone's help. Her mother died when she was younger, and their father left them. Rourke Kilpatrick is the local district attorney with a steely determination to bring criminals to justice. Rourke happens to be working temporarily in the same building as Becky. Their first meeting is not exactly a romantic encounter. Things are not easy as Becky falls for Rourke at the same time that her brother Clay is getting in trouble with the law. Overall it was a decent love story but editorial errors spoil the smooth flow of the narrative."
4,A very good blues/rock CD.,"This CD contains a number of excellent songs. Stabbed in the Back has to be Bugs at his best, singing with conviction and feeling. Anthem for the Blues and Big D Shuffle are good examples of his ability to master rock and blues, sometimes at the same time.Bugs is a hidden treasure from the Lone Star state. His music is real and down to earth."
3,not bad,"not a bad book for the beginner bible reader. some translations are thrown out of text and uses a much more modern style of writing, good for people who cant handle very old writing styles and sentence structures. Also noticed in my imitation leather edition passages from Deurteronomy 33:23 through the entire book of Joshua is repeated in print. other than that not a bad buy, binding holds up well."
1,Not user friendly,Was not happy with the flow and did not enjoy. Deleted from my Kindle and am in search of better version.
3,"Looks Great, Reads Terribly","I love the size and the way this Bible looks (hence the 3 stars). However I HATE the ESV translation. I thought I would like it and wanted a change from the NIV version, but it turns out that the ESV sentences are worded very strangely. It's difficult to pay attention to what I am reading, and it doesn't read well out loud since the wording is so unusual. This Bible is going to be gathering dust on my bookshelf. Instead I'm going to try the New Living Translation."
4,First time to use this translation,"Our pastor is using translation now. It is a little different than what I expected, but it is fairly easy to understand."
5,A lot bluer than it looks...,"The actual color of the Bible is a lot bluer than it looks in the picture above. Nonetheless, however, it's a great size, maybe not for carrying around necessarily, but to keep at home and read from comfortably. The inside pages are very simple, having two columns and not wasting space for information not needed. It includes footnotes and maps, which are both very helpful. It just looks like a pretty journal, but then when you open it up, SURPRISE! Jesus' word! I like this Bible a lot and I can't wait to start using it!"
2,i just saw these guys,"walking around the Thousand Oaks Mall last night looking to be recognized. You kids are funny... Aaron, i'll never forget when i was working at your high school and you were a 16 year old vegan punker screaming in Insurgence. I'm not really into this stuff youre doing but best of luck to you.."
4,Great book!,"I am a busy single mother, employee and university student. I only have time for a short review but it is worth my while. I have never been ill. I am 49 and I live life as any one healthy 20 year old. Being in this condition of health could make me insensitive to individuals suffering the burden of illness.I am working on my master's thesis and have to interview 20-25 individuals confronting chronic illness/disability. This book has increased my awareness of the multiple sufferings a person confronting/living with illness goes through. Reading this book has giving me a greater insight regarding The Lonely Patient. I am now an improved interviewer. Thanks Dr. Stein. (I do not have time to edit this note; I hope it makes sense.)"
4,Perfectly OK-Fine,"Samsung SCX-4725FN Network Laser Multifunction Printer. Price was right, delivered rapidly, does everything it's supposed to. Configuring the destination for the scanned images is NOT easy. It's large, the paper-feed is a bit fiddly, and I just wish I'd gotten wireless capabilities built in. But it really is perfectly OK-Fine"
2,"Good when it works, but!!!!!","This is a great machine when it is working, however, we have had a problem with reliability. Our first machine worked around a month, then stopped cold. It did display an error code which the support person we dealt with was unfamiliar with. They exchanged the unit and about 8 days later we received a new unit. The new unit never successfully fed a sheet of paper (jammed every time), and after the usual trouble shooting with technical support, this unit was also returned. 5 days later and now we have received a third unit which after 2 days appears to be working. The support was OK, with prompt swaps of non-working machines. After the second failed machine I put in for a refund as I was concerned about future reliability of a machine receiving critical faxes, but this was denied. Hope others have more luck with this unit."
2,Not very reliable,"We've had this printer for over a year, and although it's great when it works, it often gets ""LSU"" errors, which is a problem with the laser scanning unit (basically the print engine itself). This happens so often that the printer is almost unusable. Searching online reveals that this is a common problem."
3,Scanning?,"I was happy with this all in one until I found out that if you scan a 10 page document to pdf, it will open 10 seperate pdf documents. Hence forcing you to do the work of combining all the documents into one pdf. That's annoying! Does anyone know of a setting that can be changed so that it will automatically put all the scans from a ""single"" ""mutli page"" scan into ""one"" document?Plus it doesn't scan across the network. That's annoying and it sux.The upside is that it's a laser printer. Prints fast and faxes fast and clean. No probems with Printing, Copying and faxing. Scanning is missing a few bolts."
3,Decent book on the Secret Service...for the time,"As the leading civilian authority on the Secret Service, I very modestly recommend this book. Mainly for the collector out there. Get it if you are a completist."
3,"The music is fine, but this package is pointless.",All three of the songs on this EP are on the album Breaking Things. Unless you are a rabid collector there is no reason to buy this.
3,It's a good place to start.... but....,"I actually read this book two times over a period of a week. It's a short book with some great tips, and tips that just make you say... ""duh... why didn't I think of that"". But then on the other hand, it is 95% customized towards Google. What about the other SE's? The authors spent a good portion praising PPC and Googles Adwords, which could have been condensed into a shorter chapter... leaving room for tips, tricks, and need to knows for the other SE's. On one page of the book 2 URL's are listed for Yahoo and DMOz, and that's it. No other advice was given for any other site.Don't get me wrong, for the money, and for a beginer... It is a great start. But don't stop at this book, for it is not as complete as it could be."
2,low quality,"I ordered this magazine on a $5.00 a year special and even at that low price, I thought seriously about cancelling it....but, in all fairness, I ordered it for the pictures not the articles and the picture quality is very poor."
3,More ads than Bark,I love this magazine but I am disappointed that the last half of the magazine is mostly ads. I expected more articles or pictures but still all in all it is a decent magazine about dogs.
2,Way Too Noisy,"This product works as it should though it is overly loud. Using this clipper near your head requires ear plugs to stave off impending deafness. For a product in this price range, this is an unnecessary compromise and I find the clipper almost unusable. I would not recommend this product."
1,Bad news bags,This bag ripped on our 2nd use with not much in it. I'd choose something else if you have the option.
4,for serious gamers!!!!,I give this game to my hubby on christmas...and he loved it!!!if you are a gamers this one is a must have to add to your collections.
4,Fun,"I purchased the product for my son. After he and his father put it together, he says thatit was working great."
3,"Pretty good, some scratches.","It worked perfectly and was shipped in a timely manner. There are some scratches on the screen, but most are not noticeable."
4,super,"If you're familiar with the kind of music the Butchies write already, you'll love this CD. Just good riot-inciting rock with great lyrics that fit right in. The first song ""Send Me You"" is the catchiest and rocks hard; I've listened to it at least once a day ever since I got it, which was about two weeks ago. But all the songs, the more you listen to it, the more you like it. Definately a good buy, and the music is still in the Butchies spirit. And check out their music video for ""Send Me You,"" it rocks. As for it being a shame about how they aren't widely recognized and given attention...well personally, I hope their popularity doesn't grow TOO much more than it has already...."
3,"Love the Passion, But Not Liking The Sound Too Much","There are many things that I adore about the Butchie's album ""Make Yr Life"", yet many thing I dislike. For the positives, the lyrics are AWESOME mostly because they're so les, but also because of the catchiness, the vocals are often on the brink of an orgasm which is very hott, the pace of the songs is fun and very energetic. I've listened to ""Send Me You"" Many, many times, dispite its almost commercial sound. This album would be perfect except for the aforementioned commercial sound that pops up sometimes and also the times when the vocals crack or get pitchy, which is very irritating. The best songs are definitely ""Send Me You"", ""She's So Lovely"", and ""Everything & Everywhere"""
3,passable,"I bought this album for the 2nd disc, featuring the original recordings. Precious little of this genre is available on cd. I'm satisfied, but not particularly delighted with it. The sound quality is mediocre. Apparently the source recordings are later-generation lp's, not the original 78's. Also the title is misleading, since only a few of the recordings are from the 30's. Most of the songs are from the 40's and 50's. The liner notes also leave a lot to desire, featuring short biographies of some of the singers, but virtually no information about the recordings on the disc. I'm happy with the music, but look forward to a better presentation of these recordings in the future."
4,very happy!,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the umbrella holder. Its not strong enough or large enough to hold a larger umbrella. Other than that, I love it! I go to the beach every weekend now that I can carry everything easily and also it goes over the sand very well!"
4,Great cart...except for Front wheels!,"We love the Deluxe Wonder Wheeler Beach Cart. This is the 2nd summer we use it---and we use it often! Only problem---the front wheels. (That's why I gave it 4 stars.) One came off the 3rd or 4th time we used it. We reattached the wheel but it came off again. This summer, the other 1 came off. You know what? We are using it without the front wheels. It is still a great cart. Like another reviewer said, when you get to the sand, you need to PULL it as it wont go forward as the wheels aren't thick enough. It holds a large cooler, 3 chairs, 2 beach umbellas, sand stakes, my beach bag and the food bag. We only need to make 1 trip! Gotta love it!"
4,Great product!,This worked great! I ordered it shortly before we went on vacation and it arrived it time! Was easy to put together and worked great on the beach! We could put lots of stuff on it and didn't have to carry anything but the kids.
3,Beach Cart,"Haven't had the opportunity to use it yet; however, I think it will be fine if I could only fold it up. That seems to be a problem."
2,Not great on sand,"Its very roomy and was very easy to assemble. Unfortunately, its not real good in the sand, which of course is the reason that I purchased it. The better ones have larger wheels which are necessary for this type of cart. You have to almost drag the cart through the sand to transfer the beach stuff."
2,Woefully inadequate,"I'd completed the CCNA with the help of the corresponding Sybex book, (I thought it was fantastic), so hoped the BSCI book would be much the same. I was sadly disapponited. The first 5 chapters seemed to be the exact same content as the CCNA book, and the other more complex stuff was very difficult to understand. Having read the Cisco self-study I think this book lacks a lot of content, is badly written so as to make the subject unintelligible, and the examples given are so utterly trival that I don't see how they help you understand the concepts. Do not waste your money."
2,I generally love Robert L. Forward's work but...,"I am sad to say that this was pretty bad. I couldn't finish it because the characters were so overblown and poorly written.This was one of his first books and while I HIGHLY recommend virtually everything else he's written, this one was a failure."
4,A taster,"I have to agree with the other reviewers here, this is a pretty good place to start with the Dots, although I dont actually own this disc I do know all the tunes and this is a great selection.Some may feel it lacks at least one Premonition (not sure if I can describe one accurately)the longer ,weirder soundscapes side of the band but what you do get is pretty wonderful.The danger for the obsessives amongst us (who me ?) is that after hearing this we will want ALL the Dots we can get our hands on.But if that happens you can always give this disc to a deserving friend and set them on the path too.Enjoy"
5,Roger Steffens,"""A seamless fusion of styles, merging into a coherent whole-The Process fuses a fierce pop-friendly sound with rootical reggae vibes to create an ear-pleasing, soul-satisfying mix."" Roger Steffens, The Beat."
5,THE EXCELLENCE OF THIS BOOK.,"I USED THIS BOOK FOR A CLASS I WAS TAKING AT HOLY NAMES COLLEGE IN OAKLAND, CA. IT IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO ENJOY READING. THE STRATEGIES USED IN THE BOOK CAN BE USED IN ANY GRADE LEVEL. I TEACH IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL (7-8) AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS BOOK. HOWEVER, THE PRICE, $67.00, IS PROHIBITIVE. THERE IS NO WAY I CAN AFFORD THE PRICE. TOO BAD. I LIKE THE BOOK."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"This book is a complete waste of money. The book doesn't contain ANY relevant information. The authors just goes on and on about NOTHING. They have got to be payed by the number of words, why else put irrelevant quotes on every second or third page?Do NOT buy this book!"
1,"Don't count on 10 years, I have several that failed at 3 years old","I recently bought an apartment building where several of these (model 0910) had been installed a few years ago. Last summer, the first one failed, and since then I have had 3 others fail. They were not subject to extreme temperatures or humidity. The sticker on the back of the one I have here is is dated 2009 Oct. 7 so it failed at about 3 years. I contacted Kidde through the customer service feature of their website a couple months ago but the company has not replied. This particular product is not worth buying, and based on the failure to stand behind their product, I will never buy Kidde brand products again."
2,10 years??? Mine lasted less than 5,Very disappointed. Spent the extra money so as to not have to replace batteries. But ended up getting less than half of what kidde promised.
3,Battery Life a Bit Unpredictable,"I installed 30 of these in bedrooms of apartments that I manage. I was concerned that the manufacturing date was more than a year earlier, but found that the battery was not ""activated"" until the first time the detector was inserted in the base. Two of the detectors failed in the first 6 months. I contacted Kidde and received replacements promptly. They had no explanation for my experience. I disassembled one of the detectors and was not impressed by the batteries I found.I'm at this site now because another detector has malfunctioned. The device was performing its ""end of life"" chirp - when just less than 2 years old. I'm going to get some spares to handle this and future failures since not having to change the base has some value to me.There is no information on the front of the detector that identifies that there is no battery to replace. I printed a transparent ""Sealed - No Battery to Replace"" label and afixed it to the front."
2,End-of-Life Chirp After 2 Months,I'm not impressed. During a recent renovation these were installed all over the house. This was about 2 months ago. One of them just did its end-of-life chirp thing. No way to replace batteries - just disable and throw away. What if they all start dying now?
2,Chirpped out in less than 3 years,I didn't quite get 3 years of service before it chirpped itself to death. Luckily you only need to break the seal on back to flip the switch - one way - to force battery kill and silence again.
5,Clark's White Thought is a master work,"A groundbreaking book from a living master of poetry, White Thought is an extended meditation on mortality and loss. Although Tom is not all that impressed with Lou Reed, this book resonates on a similar level as the album Magic & Loss. It is simultaneously poignant and hopeful, with tight, brilliant music playing against the capital 'M' meaning of the poems themselves. Perhaps one of the only books of poetry in the 90's that just goes ahead and says what it has to say."
5,gotta question,"which of you think this ppv was solid,well it wasnt it was an average.some people gave it a 5 and what notbut look this is just another ppvanyways i gotta gestiong,a.b . or this ppv \please i wanna know"

2,This is no where near a classic PPV.,"From all the advertising, i was expecting way better, and so were many, the barbed wire steel cage match was a joke. New Years Revolution looked like a sign that 2005 wouldn't have that many boring PPV's but i was wrong. This moved way slow, in fact the card was totally out of order, Cruiserweight match was good, pretty good match there. But everything else, Smackdown need a new creative team, because both Raw and Smackdown have seperate creative teams and Raw got the better."
5,Outstanding Action Film,"Of the more than 300 21st-century films I have seen so far, this is the best. Vivid characters, believable situations, slam-bang action, brilliant acting by the entire cast, especially Daniel Auteuil. As with Jean-Pierre Melville's masterpieces, the film treats American noir themes existentially. Engrossing for every second. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
3,Great starter Windows book,"This is a very good book for the beginning Windows 3.1 user. Lots of quick tips, info, and step-by-step instructions on Windows, the operating system, and it's included apps."

1,"Response to ""I am Me'","Listen, i DON;T WHO TOLD YA THAT, BUT THEY'RE DEAD WRONG. FIRST OFF Bret Hart can't wrestle at all and never will be able to again. second Austin and the WWE are having major issues with each other, and Austin doesn't really wanna face Hogan, so the chances of that are slim to none. As for orton vs Cena, that could happen, but it is somewhat unlikely the way the storylines are moving along."
1,Crapamania,"This is my review of the very disappointing PPV Wrestlemania 21.Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Myesterio Jr.OK match but they have had better. **Ladder Match with Christian, Edge, Shelton, Chris Benoit, Kane, JerichoPretty good match **Undertaker vs. Randy Orton *Yawn, boring.Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme *Still boringShawn Michaels vs. Kurt AngleOK match but I was sleepy from the other 2 boring matches. *1/2Piper's PitThis was horrible.Big Show vs AkebonoWhat the hell is this crap? No starsJohn Cena vs JBLI hate both. They both suck. No starsTriple H vs BatistaBatista really sucks. *Besides 2 matches this PPV was really bad and such a let down. Avoid at all costs."
1,"Dude,",I would like to tell the guy who said that I was an idiot that he doesn't know what he is talking about. Kurt has won a real life gold medal. Shawn has been doing fake wrestling his whole life. If you tried to put Shawn in a Olympic stile match he would suck. Kurt is the better wrestler. Everybody in the WWE fakes it but HBK really just can't do it. Kurt will win with the Ankle Lock and watch little HBK tap out in the middle of the ring.
2,Cheaper than pay per view,Well it was cheaper than pay per view but it I suppose since everybody already knew what happened it wasn't worth it lol.
5,WWE Wrestlemania 21,"Wrestlemania 21- April 3, 2005- Los Angeles, Ca- Raw & SD!Wrestlemania will finally be a good production made by WWE. The only thing that would bring the card down is if they had a match like Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie. Other than that it should be good.

5,Samson SAMD5 Mic Stand,"Works just like it says. Heavy with a wide base holds my Yeti Mic and Shockmount, along with my blue pop filter easily. Great purchase."
2,Crazy As a Hoot Owl,"Grady McMurtry, aka Hymanaeus Alpha, the legally recognized legitimate head of the O.T.O. after Crowley until his own death in 1985, personally told me he thought this book was a terrific laugh. Grant's own additions to Crowley's legacy are wild to say the least.On a path that is already fraught with dangers and pitfalls, further screw-loose directions are not recommended."
4,Good disks,These have worked out just fine for my purposes with nary a problem so I would recommend their use to anyone. And the price is a bonus as well.
5,It is about time!,"I am so glad that Skindred is finally getting the recognition that they deserve! This CD, ""Babylon"", is simply a solid album. It incorporates so many different musical styles from hard dropping jungle beats to some sweet heavymetal bass and guitar. Furthermore, Benji, has got to be one of the most versatile vocalists around these days. Not only are the lyrics delivered perfectley, they are hard hitting and deal with some serious issues. I for one am thrilled that more and more people are having their eyes opened by Skindred, it's about time! Now all we have to do is get them to come to Canada on tour!!"
4,"Predictable, but Fun Read","The Heartbreaker follows in the footsteps of the other books in this trilogy, the Bachelor and the Playboy. It is a good, fun read, but very predictable.In this story, Chase Chandler (the oldest brother) goes to Washington DC to visit his brother, Roman, and to get an exclusive interview with a senator's wife. He ends up meeting a beautiful woman in a bar and having a one night stand. Then finds out that he has to protect this woman from danger when they return to Yorkshire Falls, Chase's hometown. IF he can do that...he will get his exclusive interview.Of course the two end up with feelings for each other. Of course Raina Chandler plays matchmaker. Of course Chase tries hard not to fall for the girl...because he's always been so independent. However, it is a good story with a decent plot line. It ties itself up nicely with a little bow and end the trilogy well. For a fun read, I'd definitely pick this up."
5,"the abc to clinical research,an extraordinary book.",Dr.David Ginsberg guides the reader through the complex world of clinical research.The book is an excellent prime to understand the drug research industry.I was fascinated by the simplicity and yet profound way that this author teaches the wisdom that a researcher has to have in order to be successful in this science.It will inspire every reader to want to do good.
3,Lovely historical detective story,"This second installement of the Molly Murphy Mysteries follows Molly trying to start up as an investigator. She starts working as PI Paddy Riley's assistant, until he's brutally murdered. Molly can't help trying to solve the mystery...She's new to the business and this creates many funny situations and causes her some trouble along the way. Also, she's still new to New York, and her naive meetings with her contemporaries are also very funny at times.We meet again some of the characters from the last novel. It's worth reading them in the chronological order, mind you, as they follow each other logically.This is a lovely historical mystery, with lively dialogues and a heroine with spunk. However, this is not a brutal and bloody crime novel. If that's what you're looking for, you need to read something else."
5,Awesome horse,The cookie cutter is adorable. The price was good.Easy to use;the kids cut out fruit and cheese.Good for beginners and expert bakers.
4,Try Me Again...again,"A very nice cd, however if you have purchased the first one in 1995, this release contains the same content, plus an additional song. It was my first time hearing the cd ,so I really liked it, Ms.Burrell has a beautiful voice!"
3,good but needs updating,This book is a good review but there are some questions that could use some more up to date information. The answer key could use some more explination to the answers given. The questions could cover more information and with the updated info more questions could be posed. Overall the book is a good review but should not be the only one used.
5,Yes birth can be pain free (or 95% pain free!),"I didn't read this book until I was pregnant with my 3rd child. I had already had 2 unmedicated births following the Bradley method. I believe that Hypnobirthing combined with Bradley leads to the best birth experience. I labored the entire time in silence, in the ""zone"" and free of pain. The only true/intense discomfort I felt was right before pushing - when I had to adjust my position. As long as I stayed in one position, no pain! Seriously, this works. AND - to the critics, I never took birth classes, did home study only, and had 3 blissful unmedicated births. The 2nd birth was less painful than the 1st and the 3rd was truly a bliss - I was high for days....loved it."
4,Needs more meat,"This book was a great introduction to the concept of hypnosis for childbirth pain control. It was my first exposure to the idea, and it sold me on it! This book made me believe I too could do a natural unmedicated childbirth. However, even though I listened to the CD and read the book, I felt I did not have enough tools to figure out how to make it happen. I yearned for a program to follow or a training method that this book did not offer. I eventually ordered and used the HypnoBabies Home study program."
4,So Far So Good - I'm excited not fearfull of going into labor for once,"I have two children already and for the first one I was scared becuase I didn't know what to expect. For the second I was scared because I knew what to expect. I wanted to try something different that would allow me to be more in control of my birth experience for my third and final birth. I bought this book and read thru then decided I would benifit more from taking the HypnoBirthing class. I found a class in my area signed up and realized upon signing up with a HypnoBirthing instructor they automatically give you this book, along with the Rainbow Relaxation CD that is referenced thruout the book as part of your fee for taking the class (so now I have two books). The class has been great and the relaxation techniques have already improved my sleep and I am more excited then ever to give birth to my third child in July 2010 and use all the tools I have learned. I will update upon delivery my birth experience."
5,Delivered after a painless 20 minute delivery,"I took the hypnobirthing class for my first child, and then used this book and the accompanying CD on my own. I practiced the ""Rainbow Relaxation"" track upwards of 50 times. The morning I went into labour, I spent a few hours in the bathtub doing the rainbow relaxation, resting, and watching comedy on Netflix with my iPod. Then I went to bed, continuing the Rainbow relaxation, and was so relaxed that I slept between the contractions (and through many of them). My water broke, and I went into active labour. I was so relaxed and pleasantly groggy that there was no pain, and my daughter was born 20 minutes later. I can't say enough great things about this system."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"This was another case of Tolkien mania -Boring, but I had a look due toyou know who's name. That John Ronald Reuel Tolkien guy really gotme in as a kid, as he did many others. It was also a lot of what wasavailable, or what the various relatives had around for you to get yourhands on, or the library, so that is what you took a crack at."
3,"Ironic, but not his best","How will strange people react to strange beings? This is the main frame of this book. I found it easy to read, nice to understand and the story flows with some surprises. The well written pace and narrative helps, and the stereotypes included are just what you need for a smile or a thought. It takes five days to end it, if you only read at night and it is an enjoyable text before you go to sleep."
4,There's gold here along with the dross,"A mixed bag. The CD collects two earlier LPs recorded for Prestige/Moodsville; the Moodsville date (4/12/60) has Shirley Scott on organ, the Prestige date (5/1/62) Horace Parlan on piano. The Prestige session is much superior. Everything just clicks: the tunes are great, tempos vary, and the playing is inventive. There's not a single dud on the whole session, and the beautiful slow version of PLEASE SEND ME SOMEONE TO LOVE is a real standout.The earlier Moodsville session is rather lackluster. The addition of Ray Barretto's conga, usually a plus, just doesn't seem to work here. FROM THIS MOMENT ON, taken up-tempo, is the highlight on this date. So we have a so-so album paired with a great one. In my opinion, Lockjaw gives enough pleasure on this CD to make it still worth checking out."
3,Awaken Healing Light of the Tao,"This book would be of interest to those interested in the subject. It is well written but rather wordy, although it is well illustrated. A most succinct version would be more attractive."
3,Basic information,"This was not bad however, I didn't feel it was a quality investment. Mostly it consists of a support group and its members talking about what is going on in there lives as young Gay folks. I felt that ""Growing up Gay"" was a much better learning tool and a fantastic investment."
3,3-1/2 stars -- Rough start,"The Starting Line is another one of those bands that's trying to break free from the ""emo"" tag and instead lean toward more ""standard"" rock; I guess maybe it's because record companies didn't exactly know what to do with them, as each of their albums has been released on a different label (and I never even heard of them until now). Anyway, now they're on Virgin Records with Direction.The first song is the title track, which is about the least emo song on here: too bad it's not arranged very well. But there are much better songs like ""Island"", ""Hurry"" and ""I Could Be Wrong"". Still, there are times when the songs don't make much sense, like ""Birds"", the bizarre ""Way with Words"", and especially ""Somebody's Gonna Miss Us"": ""If S-I-L-Y-M-I is still all you want""? What?Even though this is the Starting Line's third album, they still have some work to do if they want to be considered seriously; maybe they'd better start with more comprehensible lyrics. B.I.F.Anthony Rupert"
5,REALLY UNDERATED GUITAR PLAYER,"What can i say, the guys got a lot of talent and in my opinion its really going to waste, but first lets talk about the album. Every song here is amazin,,,The Rapture is breath taking and Soul Finger is another fav of my mine. This album is worth any price because you cant go wrong with Mr.Lee. Its a real shame he dosent make albums anymore his talent is really going to waste and he is probably one greatest guitar players of all time. So please buy this album, you wont be disapointed..."
3,Three stars not Enough,"Maybe I am guilty of 'greater expectations'; what with three stars, Shirley and Audrey.and Lillian Hellman.Maybe the story, daring for its time,and topical for today, relied on too much melodrama.The item, the DVD, arrived promptly, in very good condition and was fair-priced."
4,Hard to find,This product is hard to find now that Estée Lauder has stopped making it. So this was a very pricy purchase and it was a gift for myself from my husband or I would have been VERY disappointed that it did not come in the original packaging.
4,Great value for the money,"This platform bed arrived in a good condition. The UPS guy carried it to the third floor himself.Easy to follow instructions, although the last step could have been moved a little earlier to avoid fitting screws up from the bottom. I was able to put it together in about an hour.I have used it only for a week now, but it looks simple and sturdy. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,Mark Ladley Delivers 'Evidence'Worth Listening To,"Mark Ladley(RIP) kicks things off with an upbeat composition of his own,'Coop's Blues'-and really shows his stuff on drums with his soloing,particularly on Thelonious Monk's 'Evidence';this cd also includes a very nice composition here-'Lost Love' by pianist Laura Caviani.The group is rounded out with John Greiner on tenor sax,Mel Rhyne on organ and David Dunn and Charlie Hoats sharing the gig on bass.In addition to the originals listed above,this cd features some very well done standards.Mark Ladley,who battled depression and died at 38,is remembered for some very upbeat music."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I read the entire book, however, I was pretty tired of the 12-step approach for addressing every problem in the world a person could have.Characters were fairly well developed, but again, they didn't have much personality, or much going on in their lives, except attending meetings."
3,Skip takes on the 12 step programs,"The debut novel in the Skip Langdon series, New Orleans Mourning, won the Edgar Award. That's a hard act to follow and Smith sure tries. Many of the good parts of the first book are still present -- Skip's wonderful observations of Southern manners first among them. Got a killer holding a hostage outside? The Police are meeting at your house for a strategy session. Of course you serve coffee and cookies -- Cream anyone?Unfortunately, the Edgar also seems to have given Smith the clout to ignore her editors and this book is easily 25% longer than necessary. The fact that the killer must be among the 12 step crowd (Codependents Anonymous) and in the six assigned to Skip is determined early. We then go through endless pages without moving the mystery forward.Bottom-line: Still a nice sense of New Orleans but slow pacing make this an optional read. Reading of New Orleans Mourning helpful but not required."
3,Not getting alot of color,"I use this daily, but am not seeing much of a difference, unfortunately. Will keep looking for the best face tanning product."
4,Fairly Happy with Product,"I have used the light version and the medium version. I believe the medium version is better than the light one on my fair skin. No orange tones for me. Just a nice looking tan. If anyone uses Bare Escentuals, I use fairly light. There is still a scent/smell, but I think it is better than the Jergens scent which I have also used."
3,"Not bad, but not great!","As an undergraduate economics student, this book served as a good reference for econometrics. While some basic information was omitted (which I would have found helpful), the book does an adequate job of laying out regression analysis, and its prerequisites, in a logical manner. The greatest sign of the value of a book, for a college student, is whether it is kept at the conclusion of a class or sold back. I kept this book, but I continue to look for an even better econometrics reference."
3,RE:CAVE DRAWING,"THE AUTHOR CLEARLY NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF EYEGLASSES.IN THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE JOHN THE BABTIST CAVE DRAWING JOHN IS CLEARLY WEARING AN ANIMAL CLOAK OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER.HE IS DEFINITELY NOT HOLDING A STAFF,AS STATED."
1,Horrible,"Item description says that it is a duvet and shams, but when I received my order there were no shams. I had to return item and am STILL waiting for it to be reshipped with shams."
2,"Coffee table literature, maybe for an dentist that specializes on Architect clients?","Not impressed with the material included, a few floor plans and drawings, though nothing exceptional."
5,Hollywood,I loved this book. Bukowski is quite an interesting character and his unique view of the motion picture industry was fasinating and extremely entertaining.
2,No é um dos melhores,"Já li alguns títulos do autor tanto de prosa como poesia e de longe esse é um dos piores.É um livro sobre o período entre o Ham on Rye e o Post Office (Misto quente e Cartas na Rua no Brasil). Basicamente fala do final de sua vida na casa dos seus pais, de parte da viagem que o autor fez pelos Estados Unidos e da vida que levou ao lado da sua primeira namorada, que o deixa no fim do livro.Enquanto isso o que acontece é basicamente ele bebe ao lado da namorada alcoólatra (que na vida real morreu disso) e pula de emprego em emprego, obviamente mal remunerados, degradantes, etc...Sem delongas, é um livro bastante chato e repetitivo. Como recentemente saiu um filme baseado no livro, como f, resolvi ler antes de me aventurar no DVD.Se vc nunca leu nada do autor, recomendo comear pelo Ham on Rye ou Mulheres, meus romances preferidos ou, se quiser um de contos, vá de Hot Water Music (Numa Fria no Brasil). Esses so geniais."
3,The perils of being a drunk,"This is a surprisingly interesting story of the authors young alter ego's travels as a young drunk. He moves back and forth across the country, finding new jobs and quitting them when they get in the way of his drinking, schmoozes women everywhere he goes, and basically adds nothing to society. Reminds me of Henry Miller's Tropic of ... books, but Bukowski doesn't come off as such a self absorbed jerk as much as someone just completely lacking ambition. Much easier to read too."
5,DISTURBING DEPRESSING GRAPHIC: I LOVED IT,"I bought Ham & Rye and Factotum in the same purchase, before I had ever read any Bukowski. READ HAM ON RYE FIRST. I happened to read them in order by complete accident, and it was a very pleasant surprise when I cracked open Factotum and found more of what I loved about Ham. Factotum is about Henry Chinaski in his high school years and beyond. He is brilliantly self defeating, much like the real life personality of his creator, Charles Bukowski. It's hard to see any hard line where Bukowski ends and Henry (aka Hank) begins. Both novels are simply wonderful, raw and engaging. Highly recommended. If you enjoy Bukowski's novels, I suggest you pick up some of his poetry as well. ""Love is a Dog From Hell"" is a trip, also very highly recommended. You'll be hooked."
3,Interesting Book,Found this book a little redundant but enjoyable. I was suprised that the ending was so abrupt and not very satisfying.
4,"Very good, but not Post Office","I absolutely loved Post Office and also enjoyed Factotum. As great as Bukowski proved himself as a poet, his prose is even better in my opinion.That said, Factotum seemed to be a bit of a watered-down version of Post Office.The main character, Henry Chinaski, bounced around jobs so much that it was sometimes hard to remember where one left off and another began. Where Chinaski in Post Office had clear needs and opposition preventing him from fulfilling those needs, Chinaski in Factotum was just kind of floating through life.Like the unforgettable scene in first book, when Chinaski argues with a superior about filling mail trays, this book also has that one incredible scene when Chinaski talks to his drinking, gambling friend who's looking for a woman. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about once you read it."
4,Good Stuff,"Every employer's ultimate nightmare Bukowski, brutally and often hilariously, describes the endless dead-end jobs he held to pay for roof, food, and booze, taking care to notice the rough poetry of faceless people on the social low-end, making a case for why (as Stendhal wrote somewhere) a proper poet should be a poor poet.In books like ""Women"" Bukowski often ends up rambling on forever on the same subjects, but in ""Post Office"" and ""Factotum"" he stays much more focused and economical. ""Factotum"" is the book that even people who can't stand Bukowski often like."
4,Typical Bukowski,"This is pretty typical Bukowski. As with most of what he wrote its supposed to be loosely based on his real life experiences. If you can get beyond his annoying habit of trying to convince you of how tough he is and exagerrating if not out and out lying about the frequency of his sexual encounters and the quality of the women involved then its a good quick read for a laugh. The best stuff in this is his humorous accounts of working various disposable menial jobs. Bukowski is very funny, a fact which seems to get lost in the shuffle by the lame hipsters who comprise the bulk of the fans of his work."
4,Power Up,"Eh, no real reason for this post...just want to know the Lyrics to Power UpAnyone know them?"
5,Great Coaching Tools,"Coach Anyone About Anything gives you an insight on how you can coach yourself on coaching someone. Within my first year after I graduated, I had an opportunity to read this book. The best investment ever made. There are some wonderful exercises which I refer to very often while preparing myself to coach anyone.The best topic I learned from this book is how to differentiate between a Coach, Manager and a Leader. It explains the fine line between how to act in each different position. I've seen many Leaders who are great at what they do however; they cannot make the difference between a Coach, Manager and a Leader."
5,Pavarotti CD,You can say nothing bad about Pavarotti's voice. A wonderful Tenor and truly the best voice.
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,My husband and I love Pavarotti. He's the best classical singer of our time. I don't have the CD glitch problem like others did. My copy goes well with both my Alexandria X-2 loudspeakers and iPod.
5,Kindle Fire - Chile,"I'm from Chile and I'm not allowed to buy music from the cloud. I have a Kindle Fire and I hope to be able to buy music soon.Saludos,Caty"
1,Not bad enough to hate. Rated D+,"Well, they tried. If you could see the credits at the begining of the movie rather than at the end yould see that it was filmed in Lousiana by a small local production company. The result is less than mediocor. Peter Jurasic does do his usual excelent job of presenting a complex charicter for all three minutes he's on screen, but everyone else's performance is somewhere around the level of a highschool play. The idea of a quantum 'something' eating the earth and being saved at the last minute by a 'rain-man' with a nuclear missel which results in a time loop is interesting, but the sub plot of a highschool romance and a complete disregard of anything like real physics, coupled with a paint by numbers script leads me to give this movie only a D+, and that + only because it wasn't bad enough to make me angry that I watched it. Better stuff elsewhere."
1,Production quality of home movie shot with Super 8 VCR tape,"Not sure if it's the worst movie ever made, but it is the worst I've ever seen. The only redeeming quality is that the acting and dialogue are so bad that it's funny but those are oscar worthy compared to the special effects, which are so bad you can't even tell what they were trying to do most of the time. If they spent more than $500 to make this movie then they wasted their money. Don't was yours."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book was made just to get some more money out of the dragonlance series, according to what everyone knows from the chronicles and legends is that when Fistandantilus was killed in the skullcap explosion his essense was givin to Raistlin, but according to this book it went into his bloodstone pendent and his skull. Plus his esessence is in a kender too, if this sounds confusing it is that is why I say to avoid this book."
2,Very poor character development,This book has good elements contained within. Ever wonder what becomes of Fistandantilus after the Legends trilogy? but unfortunatly i was still left not understanding much about this book. A lot of the main characters were underdeveloped and it just kind of left me feeling unfulfilled after it was over. I wouldnt suggest this book unless your a BIG dragonlance fan
2,Good story but definitely not Fistandantilus.,"I've read almost the entire Dragonlance Saga and I have never seen Fistandantilus portrayed as such a weak character. Compounded with the fact that he sends his essence into a kender and a bloodstone pendant... come on! Fistandantilus doesn't seem the great mage he really is. And of course, the book barely even talks about Fistandantilus, instead concentrating on the kender and historian. If you want to preserve the image of a powerful and evil mage Fistandantilus really is, do not read this book!"
2,One Six Left,Stick with One Six Right One Six Left could be Left-Out.But it does help to have a complete set!!!
2,Not really interesting,I regret that the pictures of this making of are the ones of the film. I expected some things really different but not really.
3,Don't Bother,One Six Right is an amazing movie. This movie is more of a montage created from One Six Right's scrap reels.
3,"Nice glass, not for sherry though","These glasses hold about three times as much as a normal sherry glass. They are sized for white wine, not sherry at all."
3,Franklin electronic speaking 1890 spanish/english dictonary,"Convient yes.But not as good as having a standard dictonary.The major drawback is that it can not translate idiomatic phrases neither you can hear any sound(spoken)of a word combined with another one.On hind sight,perhaps a less costlier version of this will serve the learner equally & cheaply.On the whole average(THREE STARS)."
5,"Nevermind that it is also known as ""Bikini Genie""","I first saw this movie on USA, back when the network used often risque ""B"" fodder to fill the late night time slot on Fridays and Saturdays. (Remember ""Up All Night?"") James Davies plays a nerdy teen working in an antiques store who is given three wishes by a scantily clad female genie. If I recall correctly, he desires true love but is rebuffed by a series of comedically unfit women. In the end, however, he finds happiness with his equally nerdy coworker.Given the premise, and the fact that Chuck Vincent (the director) used to be involved in porn, I am not surprised that ""Wildest Dreams"" received no Academy awards, but all the same I found the story charming and romantic in a naive way, as well as very funny. Just as in ""Nadja"" surrealist poet Andre Breton observed the wonders that abounded in deceivingly second rate plays and serials, the marvelous is a constant in this unjustly ignored production that is definitely worth a look."
2,not even close to their best,I don't even need to write much here becasue eveoflone hit the nail on the head. Sludgy is the perfect word. this album is lacking melody. I would agree that there are 3 or 4 songs that are pretty good but I am having trouble stomaching the rest. It just isn't fun music like back in the 80's and 90's. Is life this bleek? sad?!?!?!
1,Carl Japikse needs to learn proper capitalization (or higher proofreaders),"I started to read this book but was hugely distracted by Carl Japikse's need to capitalize random words in sentences.I quote from a random page that randomly I flipped to, ""There is no human Scheme so perfect, but some Inconveniences may be objected to it; Yet when the Conveniences far exceed, the Scheme is judged Operational, and fit to be executed.""Wow, that's 5 unnecessarily capitalized words in one sentence. Its endemic throughout the book. Please hire a proofreader."
4,Stuff they don't teach in history...,"This book is just what the title says. Not ALL of the writings are as rare as you think but I would say most of it is unknown on a High School level. By college a lot of this should be known by anybody who knows American History or is a fan of Benjamin Franklin. There is humor but also a message in each piece, showing Mr. Franklin's views on the subject of the press, government and how to live life. Now, why did I take away a star? Because the last chapter is not by Mr. Franklin. The last chapter is Carl Japikse using the ghost of Mr. Franklin as a mouth piece. While I agree with much of what he raves against, mostly about his view on the modern mass media, this space could have been used to hold something by Mr. Franklin. That is who the book is about, after all."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing at best. It's a book about making adults behave like children. After three or four chapters, the author's philosophy becomes tiresome at best. There are a lot of good books about how to become more creative out there. This is not one of them."
5,Best of Eminem,"If you actually take the time to listen to Sing for the Moment, it is easily Eminem's best song and one of the greatest rap songs ever. Anybody that says otherwise just doesn't understand it."
1,Plastic spray head -- don't buy it !!!!,I already had Palma Danze Faucets -- and loved them -- got this one -- looks and feels GREAT -- UNTIL you pickup the spray head - it is made if cheap plastic ... looks and feels like c**p.Mine is going back -- until they make it out of Stainless as advertised.
5,Great Story!,The Death and Return of Donna Troy is one of the best DC stories I have read. It has a pretty deep plot and I love stories dealing with the Amazonians. The book was in great condition. Great Deal.
4,Lost Numbers Puzzle,"This product is great for Lost fans. As an added bonus, there is an image hidden in glow-in-the-dark paint on the back. However, you will need the complete set of 4 puzzles to make out the entire hidden image. Regardless, this puzzle is good to pass a few hours time."
2,Daydreamer,"I think the Daydreamer had a bit of scarey.Athough it is not too attractive, it still is a funny book. In some of the chapter I do not too understant too clear, I think maybe the author want to leave some scrat to let us think about the ending."
2,helens review,"i thought that the book could of been better, but was well explained and well leveled out. i thought it went on abit too much, and could of changed parts of it to make it more better the ended was good and was realistic and very well done but it didnt reach my level of standered."
3,The book review~,I think this book is a bit boring and sometimes when I read it...I'm a bit misunderstanding. I think the main character of this book- Peter Fortune is a bit silly but he has an interesting imagination-daydream all kinds of things that we might not think about it. I think the author is quite creative to write this book because it is hard to think some crazy thoughs to write the daydreams of Peter Fortune.This is my reflection. Thank you!
2,My comments,"I think this book is extremely boring and meaningless. The boy is so silly, just like a idiot. The boy always daydreams and thinks something strange. Although I appreciate his creativity very much, he should dream something meaningful and useful. He always has some new imaginations. I think the author should write something that are mysterious and interesting so that the readers will be more interested in this book. Actually, if the author can't write the book in this way, basically the illustrater should design the cover nicely, RIGHT??These are all my opinions, let me use a sentense to conclude my review. ""The book can be a lot better!"""
3,Boring and scary!,"The book is quite ok. I think this book's picture is a little bit scary, like the second chapter ""The Doll"". the picture of the doll is very very scary! And the writer of this story discribe the doll very scary too!And I also think the first chapter of the story is very boring, and I even don't know what is it talking about! But after the first chapter, the story is more interesting!"
2,Oh! It's boring !!!!!!!!!!,"After reading this book , I almost felt asleep, because this book is too boring, when I read the first paragraph of one charpter I will know what the writter want to tell us .So I don't suggust anyone to buy or read this book, It is too boring !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,review,"Nice book, although I suspect some of the 'old' photos are not so old...the film quality is just too high, still, a great book."
3,"Wonderful voice, boring music","Peter Coyle's voice is as wonderful as ever. Unfortunately, the accompnaying music to this CD is nothing compared to ""No Sense of Sin"" and is quite boring. Believe me I wanted to like this CD as I have been a fan of Jermey and Peter for a long time. I have given it a few tries, but have to conclude that the music is disappointingly bland. I would have given the CD 1 star except Peter's voice brings it up to 3 stars. Basically, I'll listen to anything in the world if he sings with it."
2,Name Game,"Here's the deal, whenever you see the name ""Charlie"" substitute the name ""Simon""; anywhere you see the name ""Sarah"" substitute ""Portia"". This book is an identical twin of, ""The Perfect Lover"". Same book, but different names. Two people, known each other for years, secret romance where they slowly ""advance"" the seduction in a summerhouse, etc. while a bit of a mystery that puts the woman in peril is in the background. So, take your pick. The strange thing is that this later book actually takes place on the timeline prior to the earlier published Perfect Lover. So much for beach reading."
1,so disappointing!!,"generally love Stephanie Laurens - but this book was really, really boring! the two main characters are barely even one-dimensional. She likes visiting her orphanage once a week, he likes making cautious investments, they both like having sex with one another, never have anything interesting to say to one another, and except for a tedious subplot about land speculation, that's about it. They both fall in love really early on, but it takes forever for him to recognize the fact - how dramatic! Of course, it is possible that the last 25% of the book is awesome -- but it was all I could do to get through the first three quarters of it."
2,"Sorry Charlie, but you didn't cut it.","I really tried to give Charlie the benefit of the doubt but come on. How long did Charlie think he was going to have a hot time in the bed at night while he treated his new wife like dirt during the day? And the ""I'm afraid to love"" was a real turn-off. He never even seemed man enough to me to rate as a hero. At least the Cynster men could kick some serious a** so their struggles with love seemed macho. Charlie just seemed like a whining baby. Just because his father made bad decisions hadn't a thing to do with love in my book. He was just a weak man and left Althea to run the family. Sorry, Charlie, you just aren't grown up enough for me to lust after.And what was it with this book saying that Portia and Simon aren't married yet? The Perfect Lover (their book) came out FOUR years before this book. That was an editing mistake that really bothered me.I love the Cynsters but maybe this series is just tired."
3,Nice but...,"It is always a pleasure to hear Domingo sing, so there is no surprise that in an Opera composed for him, he excels. But, the opera as a whole is nice, sometimes interesting, but not great. The characters in the plot barely go through any changes. Goya is the only one that has any development during the opera, and the changes are at the beginning of it and then it stops. The music for Goya is very melodic a la Puccini, while for the other characters is a mixed of melody with a touch of atonality. Performers are very good and make the maximum of the available music and plot. The production is rather simple and for a small stage. The sound is stereo only. For those opera lovers, this is an interesting opera and production worth having and watching mostly for curiosity and support of new operas, but it has no ""WOW"" effect."
4,"Live aid, a little earlier","Some great artists, a good cause, some great songs, but unfortunately not so great performances. Leon Russell and George Harrisson are Good, Ringo and Dylan are OK at best, but still a nice document of an era that won't come back."
1,Color is very pink -- not a good fit,"Some sites show this bra (#4434) in body blush/pink as looking like nude or taupe. That is why I ordered it. Just be aware that it is very pink and they should take the name body blush out of it. It's sort bubble-gum light pink, not even a ""rosewood"" which I would have been ok with. Also, the bra does not have a good fit."
2,No Java,Do not be fooled by the title. No Java in this book. Pretty decent book for software engineering but has only about 2 pages of Java examples/code in it. If you are looking for a book on Software Engineering this may be the book for you but it is an absolute waste otherwise.
1,Terrible packaging,"The packaging on this delicate product is terrible! I was shocked to see the 1/8"" cardboard and hardly any styrofoam to protect the glass and the refrigeration unit."
1,The worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"From all the movies I ever bought( I have a ton of dvds, blu rays and 3D movies), this is the worst!!!!! It should not be out in the market.I bought it, watched for 5 minutes and I decided to return it to Amazon for recycle!I you buy it you WILL be sorry."
5,THRILL RIDE,"When I finished this book I felt the way you do when you get off a wild rollercoaster - like I'd been whipped around every which way and left with my head spinning. From page one the story gets cranking, stops only for some sly insight, then hits the gas again. This one is fun, fun, fun. If you can take some harsh stuff - and this writer holds nothing back - you'll love this book!"
3,"A fun, but imitative novel","It's not surprising to learn that Ridley has worked mostly in television and film. This book reads like it was adapted from a screenplay and is very cinematic in its style. The character development is sketchy and the plot is right out of any of the Tarantinoesque stuff that has been flooding the screens and bookshelves since Q.T. himself broke big in the early nineties. Still the book is engaging, fast-paced and quite fun to read. The ending is a bit of a disappointment: Just when everything should be coming together, it instead falls apart, and Ridley despite his gift for cleverness, offers no satisfying or witty resolution to the novel."
2,Style without substance,"The writer has panache, unfortunately the story has none. A huge disappointment! If you like stories about L.A., read Robert Crais. If you like noir, read Andrew Vachss. Ridley should stick to directing."
4,Ridley Just Keeps Getting Better,"I've been a fan of John Ridley's work since I read his first book, ""Stray Dogs."" His follow-up, ""Love is a Racket"" was even better. And now he tops himself with ""Everybody Smokes in Hell."" Anyone who lives in L.A. can tell you how hilariously, horrifically, and ultimately tragically true this book is. This guy is the real thing, with a style to kill for and vision to match."
3,Uneven,"Fast-paced, humorous, pleasantly nasty, brilliantly plotted, yet unconvincing. The characters seemed contrived and unevenly developed. One character near the end of the book, a female casino worker in Las Vegas, seemed to appear out of nowhere; I was never sure who she was or what she was doing in the book. I found myself skimming some sections of interior monologue/exposition. The street language seemed overdone. Overall, the book could have used some more editing, but I don't want to give the wrong impression with all this. The plotting was absolutely brilliant and I would recommend the book to anyone who likes black humor with their red meat crime fiction."
3,l.a. black & noire,"more of a cautionary tale than a novel. a confluence of thuggery with a one beat rap tone.survival of marginal miscreants on a steady diet of nihilism,violence,misogyny,materialism and drugs in a decaying society. nathaniel west with a ghetto blaster."
5,I WANT MORE BRICE,"Easily the most exciting character I've stumbled upon in years! In a book full of wild characters moving through an insanely funny story, Brice reigns supreme. Please, Please, Please, can we see Brice again? Soon!"
4,They are not THAT bad,"I wanted a cheap pair of binoculars to just view things at the park, search for stars etc. The 7 x 50 binoculars are usually cited as being the ideal first pair. I agree with that notion, and these Vivitars are the ideal first pair also. I am not sure why they got such bad reviews from so many other people. Mine give a good, clear view and adjust easily. I can easily see nice detail in the terrain around me and a lot of stars. There is a nice feeling rubber casing around the binoculars. They are lightweight and easy to carry. The case is merely a soft cloth dustcover, the strap is nothing extra, and the eye covers are somewhat loose fitting. But hey, what can you expect in this price range?I may get a ""better"" stronger pair of binoculars, but these are fine basic lower powered ones to just knock around with."
1,it's toy for under 10 year old,"Cheap made, cheap material, the image is too blurry. this is just a useless toy, thus the price is too high for such a junk."
2,$9.99 Canadian!,"I got 'em at Shoppers Drug Mart. Just do not hold them too close and you'll be fine, For a few bucks they are good for a car pair. So you can get the license plate of that car that hit you and ran. Or the one which took a pot-shot at you one night in LA."
1,Damaged !!,This is a piece of crap. It was broken when I opened it. Spend money on something else. This is a very very bad product.
4,I'm almost speechless,"I bought this DVD at the recommendation of an opera-loving friend. I knew nothing about it, so I found a plot synopsis on the web (there are no notes at all, just a list of sections). Well, wow. This is a powerful work...the music reminds me of Wagner, except a human Wagner, with real people and emotions, instead of gods. In fact, and this will enrage Wagnerians I suppose, I think there is more honest emotion in Act II of this opera than in the entire ring cycle. The acting is believable and the singing is fine. Anja Silja as the mother is riveting. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I think the sound recording is a bit tinny, and it's not a live performance. At the end I wish there'd been an audience cheering, because I wanted to cheer too."
3,"Cute, light, fluffy, fun.","See title. I don't have much else to say... the girls were smart and fun, the boys were nice and not afraid of silliness. It was just grand fun to read!"
4,express your enthusiasm,"I would definetly reccomend this book to other people. It's a fun book and you discover something new on each page. The humor involved will always make you want to read more. When I read this book, I felt like i could relate to the situation that the characters were in. It's mostly for girls because it's about romance; but boys may also enjoy it. Overall, I thought this was an excellent book and I would read it again."
2,Not What I Expected,"I've had the itch to buy a good horse racing game ever since I re-installed the PC version of Final Stretch. As I am into the ""empire building"" of Sim-type games, and used to PC-type ""empire building"" games, I have to say that I find Gallop Racer lacking in that department.You don't really start from rags and work your way up...you just pick any horse you like. And that goes for racing as a jockey and breeding. Don't like that at all.My criticism may be a bit unfair, and predefined because I have never liked the ""cartoonish"", ""anime-type"" presentation of PS, PS2's, and Nintendo games. So for those of you who are used to playing PlayStation and Nintendo games, this game will have no affect on you.As for me, this game just reaffirms my love for PC Sims through and through."
1,Defective,"The edge was misground. It wouldn't cut all the way down to the cutting board near the heel of the knife. The result is that the knife wouldn't chop properly--ridiculous.Also, the blade was ground unevenly on both sides--a cosmetic problem, but not cool in a high-end knife."
4,good knife,as a chef I will say shun is the best knife in the world bought this knife for my friend and she loves it
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I am an avid fan of Bertrice Small. In fact I have read 90% of her books. Year after year I look forward to her upcoming published works. Mastering Lady Lucinda is vulgar and crude and not up to her usual standard. Surely there is more than one way to describe intercourse without using the ""four letter"" word over and over. This book lacks imagination."
3,From Back Cover,"Beatrice Small - Mastering Lady LucindaThe members of the underground club, The Devil's Disciples, are prepared to give Lady Lucinda Harrington an unforgettable lesson in seduction-but it it the gentlemen, and not Lucinda, who are left begging for more.Susan Johnson - Risking It AllWhen the destitute Felicia Greenwood wins the gamble of her life with the aid of the Duke of Grafton, she never expects to receive an introduction to the delectable delights of desire.Thea Devine - The Pleasure GameWhen Regina Olney learns that longtime friend, Jeremy Gavage, is devising a scheme to thwart her plans of pursuing a notorious rake, she seeks revenge by playing a wickedly sensuous game of searing passion.Robin Schone - A Man And A WomanHoping to experience once again the intimacies shared with a man, widowed Megan Branwell engages in a charade with Connor Treffrey that will take them both on a breathless journey of indescribable pleasure."
3,Worth Reading for Devine's and Johnson's alone,"I bought this book for Schone's story, but ended up liking the other 3 better. Schone's story was okay, it was just very repetitious. I felt like I was reading the exact same story from The Lady's Tutor and her last anthology, just change the names of the characters and give the hero a different sexual problem. Speaking of which, why does she think a man has to be sexually abused by other men (gross) or sexually mutilated to be a deep hero? Again, the same old scenario rehashed. Plus I'm 25, so the hero and heroine are older than my parents! (53 and 48) (I'm sorry to keep going on and on, but I had high expectations for this book! I was hoping it would be an improvement on The Lover.)The good news is that Devine and Johnson just keep getting better and better. Devine's story was so hot that words fail me! I'd buy this book for the middle 2 stories alone."
5,We will forever be Unfinished,"After attending 2 weekend retreats with Joan Anderson and reading all 3 of her books, I truly know we will always be unfinished. This is the best of the best of books. You will not be able to put this down. I have gone back and re read so much of it. It gives us the strength to be who we are. Everyone comes into our lives for a reason and Joan Erikson coming into Joan Anderson's life was a gift. The unknown is ""just there for the taking"". Their relationship was more than a friendship, it was a true bonding."
2,A Disappointment,"I enjoyed Joan's first two books, but this one was a disappointment. I don't see that Joan Erikson really helped Joan Anderson become her own person. Instead, Anderson often seemed childlike in her relationship with Erikson, allowing Erikson's voice to be more powerful than her own. Surely Anderson is mature enough to know whether she wants to cut her hair, and doesn't need Erikson to dictate what she should wear to a business meeting! Erikson may have had some valuable words of wisdom, but a true mentor honors who you are and encourages you to become your truest self without projecting their own preferences."
3,Worth reading,"Overall, the book is worth reading. And although I appreciate the relationship and deep friendship portrayed, it does tend to go overboard and become sappy at times."
5,Rainbows,"I have been wanting this sandals FOREVER, and now that I have them, I want them in every color! So comfy and resistant to wear. I recommend Rainbows to anyone looking for a quality sandal."
5,An arousing read,A friend told me about this book and he said he thought it was something I would like. He was definitely right. The stories catch your interest and holds it. You find yourself right in the action and are glad of it. Several times I was surprised to discover who I was rooting for. I was also pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the story about Roman Britain. A few times I thought I spotted an error but when I checked the author was always right. Many times I was only disappointed that the stories had ended. I kept wanting more of the the protagonists. I hope Mr. Ironrod will oblige with more books like this.
3,Still a must-have for Vaughan fans,"I was somewhat disappointed by the short length and sound quality of this DVD. The audio is very muddled in a couple of songs, especially ""The House Is Rockin"", in which you can barely hear the keyboard. I wish we could have seen more of both performances as well. Overall it is still a great presentation, especially when you contrast Stevie Ray's intensity during the 1983 performance with the more relaxed, outgoing performance in 1989. The whole DVD is worth it just for ""Voodoo Chile"" and ""Texas Flood"" alone."
3,Wanting A Little Bit More,"Stevie Ray Vaughan was one awesome guitar player and underatted singer. The footage of the two concerts is a joy to watch. The second concert is a little better because it feature the talents of keyboardist, Reese Wynas who is a perfect foil for Stevie.However, this video should be so much longer. It clocks in at a mere 63 minutes and features three songs from one concert, six from another, the closing credits, and video clips of great guitarists with Little Wing playing in the background. All these scene changes are disruptive to the viewer. Also, more songs are needed. Nothing from the Soul to Soul record.Whereas Stevie Ray was a blue ribbon talent, I am sure there are more comprehensive concerts feature this late legend."
2,Stevie is awesome; this DVD is not,"If you're a SRV fan you'll enjoy any material you can get, however, this DVD will leave you wanting more. It's not an entire concert; it's hacked bits and pieces."
3,Not as good as El Mocambo,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good DVD. After all, its SRV live! You can't really go wrong with that. However, if you are a Guitar player (like me) the performance at El Mocambo was much better. He was into each song much more and it showcased his playing more. Voodoo Chile on this one compared to the El Mocambo aren't even close.Also, in El Mocambo there is a song where he is just sitting in a chair, eyes closed, lost in his playing. Just incredible stuff. There is nothing like that in this one. Again, this is a good DVD. But, if you are a guitar player looking to see SRV at his best, get live at El Mocambo. If you are looking for best sound and video quality, get this one."
2,Wrong songs!,"I watched the DVD and was immediately disappointed. I saw the original two performances in 1983 and 1989 (on TV of course). His second performance in 1989 was far more powerful. His rendition of Voodoo Chile was somewhat tame in the 1983 episode that you get on this DVD whereas the 1989 performance was his best ever. Even better than the El Macombo. This was not on the DVD of course. This DVD is a typical Sony ripoff. Until they give the entire 1989 performance on DVD, Live from the El Macombo is the best example of SRV's genius."
1,More lousy products!,The audio on this disk is absolutely terrible! The worst I have heard yet on a DVD. It is also just part of two different performances. Why didn't they include both complete shows from Austin City Limits?
1,bla,"why are you praising this guy so much? he was just playing the blues! anyone can do that now-a-days! i thought the dvd was boring and was another blues artist. big freakin' deal!you want some real guitar master, search for steve vai, joe satriani, yngwie malmsteen, john petrucci, tony mcalpine, etc... these are the true guitar gods!lets be real here, the dvd was crap. don't waste your money on it."
2,Poorly engineered bed rail,"This bed rail system was a disappointment. The bed rail is engineered with a snap in place bar system that is meant to lock the bed rail into a straight position; however, the side rail would not snap in place despite repeated attempts. Also, the system isn't really portable--it weighs a ton."
1,Heavy Duty is misleading,The gloves are okay for small tasks. despite the other reviews i purchased them because they claimed to be heavy duty. Some times i can not even manage to get them on without them ripping. I am searching for a different brand to use and these will more than likely just sit on a shelf until i throw them away.
4,Gloves,These are pretty good nitril gloves. They are a little thin and tear fairly easy. I use gloves all the time on my Mustang project so when these are all used up I will try for a little thicker glove.
1,What went wrong!!!,"Ed Alleyne Johnson is an incredibly talented musician. Excellent violin player. His CD ""Purple Electric Violin Concerto"" was simply amazing. The music was smooth and each note ""velvety"". This CD has shifted the focus to his wife's singing. I cannot hear Ed's violin, it was way in the back. And I don't think she can sing!!!"
5,Excellent for people wanting to practice channeling,"I read this at the same time I was being taught channeling by another channel. It was right on the money with respect to feelings, processes and concerns I had during the time I was learning to channel. I've recommended this book to many people who are just getting started, and would like to do it safely and successfully."
2,Psychic Channeling,Just didn't like the book; quit reading after one chapter as I got an eerie feeling...bad vibes. I don't plan to be a medium.
5,Amazing Book,I loved reading this book. Each time I read this book I have a feeling of peace and feeling good. It explains how to channel and makes it very doable.
2,Watch out for the Band,"I bought this watch as a present for an avid sailor. After 6 months the band started to fall apart - the large problem is that you can't get an over the counter replacement band. You have to send the watch back to timex which will take upwards of two weeks. They also do not have any other options besides the original rubber band, which I will assume will break again."
1,Outdated information,"Getting this book was a big mistake. It seems like this book was going to have a lot of information but it does not. The print is very large and there are many large empty spaces on many pages. The content is completely out-of-date. This book was first published in 1985 and most of the content is from 1985. The photos in the book are blown up jpegs stolen from web sites (hence the different photo credits on EVERY image). It still refers to servers as ""mainframes"". This book basically tells you about the different kinds of bar codes and how they are read. And THAT IS IT. There is NOTHING about software or modern hardware. There is nothing on creating a database. There is nothing about wireless technologies. My message: AVOID THIS BOOK."
4,Breaking into Bars,"The writer has a project for a systems analysis course: do a mock analysis of a particular business. A friend in wholesale diamonds, willing to cooperate, was found. He told me that he wasn't into computers but has heard that some of his colleagues use bar codes. An Amazon.com search yielded the book by Bushnell and Meyers. It is a good introduction to the topic. It uses simple language to discuss the different types of relevant technologies, encourages their employment, and lists the suppliers as well as sources for further reading. Not a bad start for me!"
5,Perfect fit,I was looking for recipe holder that wasn't a box that would take up room on my counter top and this was perfect. The retro styling makes it very neat and it comes with recipe cards and everything. That you can take the cards out and move them around and add more pages makes this very versatile. I love it!
2,Corny/Bad Writer,"I just can't focus on a book when the writing is silly. I returned this book after reading half of the first chapter because I felt like I was trapped on the bus with a 'funny' computer guy.Who knows, maybe this is a great book, but the voice I was getting as a reader in the author-reader transaction was too awkward, and I couldn't pay attention. I don't have this problem with O'Reilly books, and I have ordered one from them. We'll see."
5,Brave,"""John Patrick [U.S.] is a modern master of the genre!...This writing is what being brave is all about. It brings up the kinds of things that are usually kept so private that you think you're the only one who experiences them.""--Gay Times, London"
4,Flash Fiction: 72 Very Short Stories,This anthology is filled with compelling stories and I highly recommend it to lovers of short fiction.Fifty-One Flash Fiction Stories
4,Imagination,"Flash Fiction is a book that realy let you read from many different point of views. you can see the imagination of people and the thoughts they may have about something you may not even consider in that sense. It was fun reading this book. I really enjoyed it. It proved to be more fun than it looks. There have been book with short stores in the past which I got the chance to read, but the emotion was not expressed very much as the authors did in there stories in Flash Fiction."
4,gratos recuerdos,"EL BLURAY ESTA BIEN GRABADO,BUENA IMAGEN Y MUY BUEN SONIDO,PERO LO MAS IMPORTANTE SON LOS RECUERDOS QUE ME TRAEN CANCIONES QUE EN SU EPOCA FUERON GRANDES EXITOS"
1,roberto carlos excelente video pesimo audio,creanlo suena mejor el dvd normal que el blueray en el dvd tiene DTS y en el blueray linear pcm increible
2,BOOK LACKS SOUL,"I was looking forward to the book, but the book arrived damaged as it was shipped without proper packaging material. The book is very heavy and was disappointed with the contents of the book. I had to return the book, mainly because it was damaged. If you are looking for an informative and comprehensive book on India with nice photographs, the award-winning book India Unveiled by Robert Arnett is what I would reccommend."
3,"Jock Sturges first, not best book, does have some nice work in it","Mr. Sturges first photography book, it shows the style his fans all know and love but as a first effort has a less polished feel to it. I was surprised to see some pictures taken in Rhode Island, the later books seem to consist of France, California and Oregon with no East Coast U.S.As always with Mr. Sturges books the subject matter is mostly nude but there are several clothed photos here as well, more than will be found in later books. The style is all well done,(many very nice images), the book is certainly worth owning but doesn't seem quite the quality of the books from ""Radiant Identities"" onward."
1,NOOOOOO its a rock song playing in the background,EMINEM WHY YOU SOLD OUT COMPLETLY YOUR TRUE FANS HATE YOU NOW YOUR DAMN MEDIA HUGGING SELF YOU MAKE BARNEY THE DINOSAUR MORE ORIGINAL THEN YOU. TO ME YOUR THE NEXT VANILLA ICE. YOU KILLED THE ORIGINAL SONG. YOUR NOT ORIGINAL ANYMORE
5,absolute funniest play ever,I'm a huge Tyler Perry fan and this is just one of the 4 movies I owned that was stolen from me. I decided to order them here because of the price. Awesome deal!!!
5,""" A winter Talisman"" by Johnny Cunningham","A great mix of seasonal winter music and spoken word..... The cut, ""An Urbane Scotsman In Alaska"", while not seasonal in the strict sense, is a classic. The Scottish brogue has a great lilt to it in this collections song lyrics and spoken word. This is a great alternative to much of the seasonal schlock that floods our ears, every year."
1,pathetic,"I remember these guys from the 70s. Used to like the first two albums. Found this 2 in 1 release in used bin, and was quite pleased. Never heard of either album before, but should still be a blast from the past. Played it through that night. Awful. truely, there's not one song I'd reccomend on the whole thing. Even wimpy simpering hair bands like poison, or REO speedwagon at thier worst, made better music than this. Perhaps if you're a DIE HARD fan of this band you might like it, but anyone else, save your money."
3,Fairly Good Plant Descriptions,"This book deals with plants grown in Colonial Williamsburg. It seems to have fairly good plant descriptions, but tells you little about growing them, mostly about the plants origin. If you are a gardener and want to know how to grow these plants in your garden, you won't find much information about it or where you might be able to obtain seeds for some of these older plants. A lot of them are not currently grown today, so it would be hard to find the seeds or seedlings to get started. I purchased this book because I am planning a Cottage Garden and am interested in plants grown during that time, so for me the book is interesting."
2,"quality is OK, missing many pieces","The gasket set came complete, however, one gasket I needed, wasn't in there. It was also missing about 5 o-rings, so I had to go and source those separately. The quality of the gaskets is OK, not quite as good as the OEM gaskets. I wouldn't go with the Moose gasket kit again given my experience with this kit. I did make sure this kit fit my model, and yet it still wasn't what I would consider a ""complete"" gasket kit."
5,"This book gave me one of my greatest, most cherished memories...","Last summer I was visiting my ailing 98 year-old grandmother with my 3 year-old daughter and my father. I knew she didn't have much time and we wanted to make our last few visits memorable. I brought this book to read to her and to my little girl. I couldn't help but feel the beautiful spirit in that room as I read those words. She was very special and was preparing to return to the Master and I felt His love for us as I read. After we finished the book my little girl went to the bed and held her great-grandmother's hand, I went to hold her other. She passed on about five minutes later. This book will forever remind me of a beautiful moment with my beautiful grandmother and my beautiful baby, when we were able to be there when she returned to her Maker."
4,Great Book,"I read this book to my students at the beginning of the year. It is a wonderful book that teaches children to not 'label' one another. That we are all unique and talented. Every year, I tell my students to not use 'dots', we work as a team to help each other."
2,Not that Special,"It's a good story but I didn't like the creepy artwork. There's another companion book I got, too, but I'm sending them both back. Thought it could've been illustrated ""cuter"" for kids."
5,God is love,"This book does a tremendous job of showing us how much God, our Creator, loves us. We as humans constantly are judging each other and feeling as if we are being judged. It is great to know that God loves us no matter how others see us."
4,LOVE this story,"This is one of my favorite stories and I was happy to find it in a board book! My only complaint is that the story starts on the inside of the cover, there is no room to write a dedication to the child I gave it to. But that's okay. Love the story :)"
4,arrived quickly,"I have a new copy of this book and love the story. I wanted to give it to a child so i bought a used copy off Amazon. This book was in pretty good condition except for some black permit marker on the back, looks like a kid drew on it. other than that my order was great. inside of book was in excellent condition and i received it very quickly.. At a great price.. yes i would order again from this seller..."
2,Sort of OK..,"The basic idea is that what matters is not what anyone elsethinks about you, but what God thinks about you.Nothing wrong with that.However, what is missing, is the idea thatLove is not the same thing as Tolerance, andyou shouldn't call good what is bad, or bad what is good.I would not want a child to think that God loves them,therefore it doesn't matter what s/he does.Other books by this author I read were, Best of All, andYou are Mine, and I was very unhappy with them."
5,Best Graduation Gift,"My wife and I have been mentoring high school students for years. Every year she give this book as a graduation gift to her female students. Its simple in form but very deep and impacting in context. Great book, great message for all ages."
5,What A Warm and Wonderful Story!,I read this book last night (at the prompting of a friend who had bought it for her daughter last year) and I was very touched! What a wonderful way to tell children and adults that each and everyone of them is very special - no matter what others say about them - because in God's eyes everyone is perfect!
2,No Step by step,"The Instructor performs the kata from two viewpoints, facing you and from the side. There is no verbal description. He does not teach you the kata step by step and he does not tell you how to apply the breathing techniques in a kata that breathing technique is very important. If you want step by step instruction of the kata look another place."
1,CAUTION!!!!!!,"Do NOT buy this Cable if you're planning to buy a new click wheel ipod, they're not compatible, (use M9688LL/A cable kit instead)."
3,opera,"I purchased this for a school project. It served its purpose, I probably would not purchase this strictly for entertainment."
4,Great Book to Use When Writing an SSL app.,"If you have little or no experience with SSL, or OpenSSL, get this book. It explains the principles behind SSL, and then goes on to cover OpenSSL. The companion website opensslbook.com contains the latest examples.The only drawbacks to the book are the way that the authors cover random number generators for windows, (totally excludes the MS crypto function cryptgenrand(), in favor of the Author's own entropy collection system), and the creation of certificates could have been covered a little better. I also kept having to consult the Openssl API documentation for clarification on certain things, but overall this is a great book."
5,I LOVE THIS !!!,"I cant beleive how much the price went up, I bought this for 327 dollars, now Im really glad i bought this. i love watching movies and am very addicted to TV shows, I record my shows on my Archos and bring it with me whenever I leave the house so I can catch up on my shows if I get a chance, specialy at work during my lunch break, its a good way to wind down from my crazy work before I have to gear up and get ready to face the madness again.It is so easy to record shows, and as long as u know how to figure out the in and out video/audio cables to and from your TIVO and TV then you are good to go. You can even download ebooks on your Archos and use it like a mini Kindle, the screen and letter are just small though, but if you are into saving money then just suffer a little. I did finish the latest Harry Potter book on my Archos."
2,"Was great, now not so much","We got the Archos 504 for Christmas and it was great! It handles just like a USB, you can play videos and music. We loved it. Today, January 29, it stopped working. I looked in the book and Archos said that if the software failed, the customer was responsible for the cost of replacing it. I just hope Amazon will come through. Good luck."
4,Nelly and JT can 'Work It!',"I'm a fan of both Nelly and Justin Timberlake. Nelly appeared in *NSYNC's song 'Girlfriend' as well as the video, so when I heard the two of them were teaming up for another collaboration, I knew it would be awesome...and that it is. 'Work It' is one of those songs you can just groove to. The lyrics are great and the beat will have you moving the second you play it. JT's smooth voice-overs throughout the song add just the right amount of ""flava"" to the track. I can say nothing more but a job well done!"
1,"Error packed game, not worth the money","This game was basically converted from PS2 to PC. It is full of errors and crashes often on most PC's. :(If you want to actually play this game, get it on PS2.There is no support for this game either... Atari is aware they made a coaster for a game and will not respond to any help requests.Not for PC. Grade: F-"
3,redundant,"Though I respect Dr. Weil very much, I didn't feel that there was enough new information in this book.I expected it to more thoroughly expand on his terrific but fairly routine website info. I need more extensive discussion of health issues that concern me.I would say ""don't waste your money on this book"", because there is not much in it that isn't already on the website."
5,"Cute, Cute!",This outfit was so cute that I had to get it for my boys. It shipped really fast and the sizing was on point!
5,"Lyrics, please","Anuna is truly producing wonderful music. However, can anyone tell me where to get the lyrics for their albums? As a writer, I feel words are important. I'd appreciate any help in this matter and would gladly pay to have a lyrics sheet. But for those who just like sounds, it's astounding stuff."
5,Funny is funny!,"Here is a story that start to finish is funny. It's actually a bit funnier than ""...Sheriff"". The acting is perfect, (Harry Morgan is less loud in this one) and the humor, top notch. Want to laugh and not feel guilty? This is one of those movies. Maybe more of a guy movie, probably because of James Garner, but an enjoyable big bag of popcorn, none the less."
3,DVD movie,"I chose this DVD , because I enjoy it when I seen it for the first time.i have not watched yet , I couldn't tell you whether it works or not"
2,Western,"This movie was suggested as a real funny movie. Turned out it was kind of Stupid, if you like this kind of comedy. Not my favorite."
2,"Very Disappointing Follow-Up to ""Support Your Local Sheriff""","""Support Your Local Sheriff"" is a great James Garner comedy. ""Support Your Local Gunfighter"" is a disappointment, like so many sequels in the movie world. The ""Gunfighter"" script is as bad as the ""Sheriff"" script is good. For example, ""Gunfighter"" has nothing to match the great ""prison without bars"" gag in ""Sheriff"""
2,Not up to other Leatherman products,"I carry a Squirt P4 daily, and have just used it to death - a fine tool. I also have a Skeletool and it's as cool as it looks. But then I bought one of these Juice S2's at a big box store, and as another reviewer pointed out, its build quality is poor.Even after spending time with dry lube and trying to work them back and forth, the screwdriver bits are too tight to open without another tool. The flat screwdriver blades are so sharp that I literally cut myself on one - I guess they can't ease the edges at this price point.The scissors are also of poor quality. I did give it 2 stars, because the pliers work well, and it has a nice knife blade. But I'd recommend a Squirt instead as a better choice for daily use."
4,"Perfect, but dangerous out of the box","I have been looking for years for a multitool that has the essentials, but nothing more, at a size that you can comfortably carry in your pocket. After getting the Juice S2, I have no doubt this is the perfect one. I took it on a trip to Canada, and used it everyday - it is very functional and useful. As other posters have noted, however, the flat head screwdrivers are dangerously sharp out of the box. At first I thought they must have baby skin on their hands, but while I was opening and closing the flat heads, working in lube (yes, as others have noted, the screwdriver bits are tough to move out of the box) - I sliced my finger open. Nothing a dremmel can't fix. I rounded the edges, and again, I am very satisfied with this product."
1,"Thick in volume, thin on content.","This book appears very thick, but after a quick skim it becomes very apparent that the book is has been ""padded out"".Alot of the IOS outputs that fill the center pages are needless and unexplained. The questions are not well thought out and consume about 1/3 of the bookLaura Chappel's book from Cisco is thinner, has about twice as much information and is well structured in comparison."
3,"Easy to read, but not good enough","I bought this book 5 days before I took the exam. I thought it was a good one as many readers rated it 5 stars. I passed the exam but I found it did not help me any. I passed the test because of my experience as well as using other books. I totally agreed to one of some other comments, this book lacked of explanations of many debug and show commands. After all, it is easy to read but not good enough to help you prepare the exam."
5,THANKS!,Thank you for carrying this perfume in your inventory. I know its been around for a long time but I still LOVE it and you're the only people I have found who offer it! Thank you thank you!
1,Not 6 ft.,"The shipping was fast, but when I got the cable it was no more than 3 ft long. Seriously? Then when I screwed it in the picture was all blurry."
1,Enhanced should mean better,"I bought this thinking it might be a better version than the awful one floating around the traps. It is not the UCLA restoration. The only enhanced aspect of it is the DVD cover. Very, very disappointed."
3,"May not be the ""something for your kids to be amused with"" kind of show.","My kids were like ""really Dad"" and my wife gave me ""the look"".... perhaps in another time or place. Who knows try it yourself and see what you get."
2,"More Chit Chat, Less Action, More Boring","In this DVD adaption of the movie, the makers of the film comment on how 'Thunderbird 6' was supposed to be more on the 'chit chat' and character development side and less action. Let's face it, it's kind of hard to have character development with virtually expressionless marionettes that don't smile, frown, or walk. On 'Thunderbirds Are Go', the 60s style dialogue with the limited capabilities on the marionettes was easy to endure because there was plenty of action, explosions, and other SFX. Not the case on Thunderbird 6; what we get here is a long, around the world flight of Skyship 1 and a dull script. It does get a little interesting with the action towards the end, but not enough to pull the weight of the rest of the movie."
4,a must for thunderbirds fans,"the images and sounds are FAB! but the plot falls a bit short and the bad guys are too incompetent to sustain suspense, so it only gets 4 stars. still, a great buy for series fans. it has lots of extras as well, and though i only looked at the one on the biplane flown by alan, tintin & brains, it was fascinating."
2,Weak Kills Lame Effects,"Kill Katie Malone was so disappointing,the only bright spot was looking at Steven Colletti whom is very attractive but his acting and demeanor is more suited for a PG movie at best,you can take the boy out of Laguna Beach but!The effect's consisted of the actors throwing themselves on the ground and into walls as if a malevolent force was doing it..maybe a drop of blood and weak storyline.I say skip it,If you think this is going to scare you or gross you out ,wrong,it will only bore you to death.I saw it for free on cable and still wanted my time back. For synopsis read the one given."
2,KILL OR BE KILLED,"Here's the premise (I think?!):You go on-line and buy a ghost which shows up in a strange little box. But don't open the box or the vengeful spirit of servant girl Katie Malone will eventually kill you in truly graphic ways. Once you release Katie, you have to somehow get her back in the box and sell her to some other on-line nincompoop.This all plays out torturously slow with little thrills or terror. And don't let Dean Cain's top billing fool you...he's only in two brief scenes that last no more than five minutes.KILL KATIE MALONE has an intriguing if unbelievable plotline but its poor acting and uninspired direction sabotage the final results."
3,A subject greater than her biography,"Mother Teresa authorized this biography, but there are other books and videos that have captured her essence better. There's not much in the way of interviews with her contemporaries and her opponents in order to paint a picture of the subject. Instead, it's a very adoring and very superficial account of her life. (For instance, Eileen Egan is mentioned twice and apparently was never interviewed. Mother Teresa's niece is absent from the narrative. The Christopher Hitchens charges are alluded to, but not mentioned or addressed.) You can actually learn more about Mother Teresa and her deep, abiding love for God in other biographies or in the Petrie documentary. I read this while going back and forth into my other Mother Teresa books of prayers and found this one lacking in the one thing that Mother Teresa would have wanted: a sense of the reason why she became who she was."
5,Great insight into who this lady was,I've read this book twice and plan to read it again to be sure I get enough out of it.
1,"NOT Albania, but Yugoslavia","Mother Teresa is a Yugoslav national, not Albanian. She was born in Belgrade and Ms. Spink should check her geography a bit more carefully.To dismiss her true place of birth is just bad journalism.If Ms. Spink was of born in the USA from Irish decendants, would she be Irish?"
3,Very Thin Lizzy,"If you're into mostly grainy video that was probably produced for MTV, lots of lip synch, and jumping back and forth from early to newer and back again to older video clips and song......then this is your cup of tea. Glad to see some of it, and I'm a huge fan of the LIzzys, but most of this left me unimpressed. Too bad.......I don't know how anyone can give this 5 stars."
1,R Kelly Is Doing Too Much,"After all the charges on his head, he tries to release a laid back party CD, and then a gospel CD. NO NO NO NO NO NO.I guess he wants America to know that he believes in God, trying to make himself look innocent, but the music is so boring and repetitive. He tries so hard to remake ""Step In The Name Of Love"", but he does not. Why are you singing ""U Saved Me"" after your mess was exposed?!"
1,Robert Kelly losing it,"I'm a huge fan of Mr.Kelly, however this CD sucks. I don't like the ""pied piper"", mr. stepper, mr. weatherman stuff, saying ""happy people baby"" after every song. What the heck is this? This ain't the R&B star I used to know. He has this huge ego problem now and seems to be in love w/ himself. His ""R"" double CD and TP2 was his best work."
2,What!,"I bought this cd because it was on sale. I did not even realize he had a new cd out. I like R Kelly and all his previous music, but I did not like this double cd set. The first cd ""Happy People"" was ok lots of stepping beats and so on. All the tracks sound the same to me, the best track is the last one ""Happy People"" The second cd was gospel, I did not like it at all It was a big disappointment. Maybe he should have sung some upbeat tunes instead of all slow ones. No one should judge this man by whats going on in his personal life, he is still very talented but this is not his best work to date."
2,"Positive, but.....","I have to applaud R. Kelly for putting out a positive CD. On the other hand, there seem to be conflicts between his ""U Saved Me"" gospel-inspired CD and his other works. Aside from my personal feelings about Kelly, the CD is alright (and I mean ""alright"" with a straight face). ""Weatherman"" and ""Love Street"" are okay. If you know someone who has the CDs, cop it from them; save your money."
1,U Saved me,"As a Huge fan of R. Kelly, I found this CD disappointing. The religious theme just didn't ring true or interest me."
2,Can't use with Casio Piano!,"Granted, I'm a stupid consumer, but I assumed manufacturers would use the same signal-conventions for a simple accessory like a sustain pedal. I was wrong.I gave this product a 2-star rating only because it didn't work with my piano, but the FC4 seemed like a very nice pedal (very sturdy!). It had the opposite signal needed for my Casio CDP-100 (opposite meaning the Yamaha is 'open contacts on sustain', and the Casio wants the contacts closed on sustain).So, owners of non-Yamaha pianos beware! Confirm that your piano will work with this pedal before buying.For my Casio, I bought an M-Gear SP-2 Sustain Pedal. It's working fine, and seems to have the same look-and-feel as the Yamaha."
3,Doesn't work with my Casio keyboard,"This pedal sustains my Casio keyboard when it is not pressed and doesn't sustain when it is pressed. One of the other reviewers commented on how to possible fix this problem:""Make sure that the footswitch plug is properly connected to the SUSTAIN jack BEFORE turning on the power.""""Do not press the footswitch while turning the power on. Doing this changes the recognized polarity of the footswitch, resulting in reversed footswitch operation.""I tried both of those things as well as depressing the pedal while I turned the power on, hoping that it would reverse the footswitch operation. Nothing worked so I'm going to return the pedal. It doesn't appear to be compatible with my keyboard."
4,Happy customer,Bought as a christmas gift in conjuction with yamaha piano key board.It arrived on time and it works good and is built heavy enough to stay in position.
2,"Okay, but nothing new, nothing great.","Byler's debut is indeed impressive, as the hype indicates. However, contrary to critical consensus, Byler's voice is not all that new; in fact, I found it to be rather tired and trite, though often amusing. All in all, though, this book--oh, another thing: no way is this a novel--is better than much of the [stuff] that's published these days, but there's not one ounce of originality in any of the stories. Even the structure is borrowed: from Hemingway, no less. Byler, get real, get fresh, do something new with your newfound fame. Don't believe your own hype."
5,Wilson Hues for President!!,"In this book, Stephen Byler's debut novel, we are introduced to Wilson Hues, a rather average modern man. Through the 11 short stories told in this novel, we are witness to some of the more profound and some of the more touching events in the fictional life of Wilson Hues. Wilson is your everyday male trying to fit into a world that attempts to force the sexes into certain roles. He hangs out with an acquaintence who turns out to be a much more aggressive and unbalanced man than originally thought. He has problems fitting in with his college tennis team because he won't join in their macho woman bashing. When he attempts to avoid telling his girlfriend about his past, it comes out later to cause even more pain. Simply put, Wilson has nothing but poor luck. In the end (as a reviewer put it) you want to give him a hug and tell him everything will be just fine."
3,Disappointing,"I picked up this book on the strength of it's back-cover claims to blast religious notions of unity, selfhood, etc, but essentially this is an attempt to redefine such notions in the light of science. Peterson's attempts to hide his personal religious tendencies are not disguised. This might please a non-scientific Christian looking for some magic ammunition against scientific non-beleivers, but from an academic view the book only skims the surface of the topics it treats, as the author's primary purpose is to use quack-science to support his theist view."
2,Rip Description & Pic,These cleaners are good but the pic shows three indicating you get three but you only get one not three!
4,Strangers Among Us,"I read this book despite not being overly familiar with the details of the Franklin expedition or Inuit culture, so I am not in a position to argue whether or not the author's conclusions are valid. But I have to say that I found the author's arguments to be quite compelling and, provided that Charles Francis Hall accurately intepreted the stories that his Inuit friends told him, it would seem that survivors of the Franklin expedition managed to survive for several years by living off the land."
4,SOLID Pot Rack,"This is my second JK Adams pot rack. Aside from the brutal installation (our trusses were spaced at 21"" and 27"" rather than standard 16"" or 24"") this rack is solid and beautiful. We ended up angling the hooks to reach the bolts that we screwed in, but it has turned out to be better since angling the hooks raises the pot rack and allows for less shaking. Minus one star: the rack comes with too few hooks which are priced too high when purchased separately. The rack easily holds 4 more hooks but cost a hefty $30 to add them."
4,The author was murdered by Mussolini's orders,"I read this book, available for free reading on internet.The author was murdered, following Mussolini's orders.This book not only is 100% correct, but also concise.If you want to read a first hand, a real witness of Mussolini's first year on power, this book must be read.Today some believe that Mussolini was a regular man.He just thought that Hitler was going to win the war.Nonsense.Mussolini was a bad man.If you read this book, you will see the first chapter of fascism.Mussolini ever was a bad man and this book shows you this fact."
2,condition not discribe properly,"The vendor describe the product in very good condition and it was not in very good shape, I feel like I was deceive by they advertisement."
3,Unicorn Pictures,This book is good if you like pictures of unicorns. It was very impressionable for its poetry coupled with the pictures. The style is flowy and suits the poetry.
3,This is an average book!,I think this book is an average book. It is a good book if you are just starting to learn spanish. It is easier to understand if you have already had some experience with spanish. It is a good gift to someone about to start taking spanish.
4,Interesting History Movie,"I bought this during one of AZ.com's streaming video sales. Its a great story, a bit slow at first and somewhat confusing. In the last 20 minutes of the film it all comes together for a fantastic finale. Would not buy the disk for my collection but well worth renting!"
3,View from a professional,"As a professional mural painter, I found some of the ideas in this book to be inspiring. However much that was written in the book was useless information describing what you are seeing in the picture. This is not an instruction book. As for his artistic style, I really didn't care for it - his use of color seems rather Disney-esque. Everything is bright and vibrant without much richness and depth. While the creatures he paints look decent, his cherubs and people leave a lot to be desired.This book was usefull for me in the aspects of seeing how another artist does his layout, but if you're looking for a book to study murals and color use... study the paintings done by the real masters."
3,"Good book, but dated.","This book was probably great when it was first published. The recipes are rather bland to my taste. I love the way Leneman has given a shopping list and a week-at-a-time menu. Many of the ingredients would have been hard to find 20 years ago; smoked tofu has only just arrived in my area in the past year.This isn't a terrible book, but there are so many great vegan recipe books and blogs out there now that this wouldn't be my first choice."
3,It seemed like a good idea . . .,"I'm single, I'm vegan, the book seemed like a good fit. What I found, though, was that too many of the recipes depend on leftovers from previous days, and that overall, they require more time in the kitchen during the week than I am willing to spend. Also, this book has variations on the dreaded nut loaf (nut balls, nut rissoles), which I have learned to identify as a bad sign."
2,Not so good,"This is far from the best tasting energy drink. I don't care for the taste much at all. It is like drinking ground up aspirin with a little fruit flavor. They are expensive and you have to buy at least a case. If you can't find a place to buy just one first, I recommend passing this one up."
3,"Nice heavy weight, coating could be better","I really like the heavy weight of these pans. They stay nice and flat. The cooling grid is very handy.Tonight while scraping some burned-on sauce off a sheet with a plastic spoon, the coating came off. That was an unpleasant surprise. I did not expect the coating would be affected by plastic."
5,"Great purchase, good quality and easy to clean.","Ive been using these for about 8 months now.Like the rest of the reviews, these are great quality and a pleasure to use. I'm VERY picky about things I buy, I always pay for good quality and these do a great job. Well recommended."
4,These pans are great!,I love these pans. The cookies just slide off. The only negative thingI could say is that these pans are really heavy so if you have problemslifting they may not be for you. I really like the size of these pans.Definitely would buy again.
1,deceived by soundtrack,"That's exactly what it was, a 'sound' track, it was just background music, I wanted get the feel of the scenes through the classic rock songs of the film. Don't even hear one! It must be a copyright, legal issue. This just happened to be the 3rd film I've wanted the soundtrack for only to find no soundtrack or just background music. I think the front of the CD should state that the music is the music score or the songs actually heard in the film."
2,Pales Next to Spenser!,"As an avid fan of the genre, I began this book with high hopes that ended in disappointment. Never before have I seen such a derivative work like this. So derivative, it borders on outright plagiarism! Mr. Crais is obviously intimately familiar with the works of the venerable Robert B. Parker; however, in this case, imitation is NOT flattering at all."
2,Too quirky,"A friend had the same reaction to this novel that I had -- it's too bland, yet also too filleds with unlikeable characters, including the lead. Elvis is just too smart-mouthed. It is one of the few novels that I quit on in the middle. My friend says the (much) later novels are better, so I might try one of those to give the author another chance. But this one was a write-off for me.Yes....the later books are wonderful. My friend was right. I devour the later books as they come out."
4,This won awards and lots of nominations.,"Starting with the newer Crais novels I've grown attached to Cole and Pike very much.Because of that I'm going back and reading the earlier books to see how all this started and get the history. This one was full of humor and concern for the clients and we saw a remarkable change throughout the book. Pike played a great part. It seems everyone got hurt, but otherwise all was well over ruling the tense parts.Excellent for a first book!"
4,First book I read of Robert Crais,"I am a devoted Elvis and Joe fan. I read this book based on reviews of others. I liked the book but I LOVE LA Requiem. That is RC's best book, in my opinion. However I would encourage his fans to read this if they have not."
5,ELVIS IS GREAT IN BOOK 1,"Why have I waited so long to start so many of these mystery/detective books?? And why did I wait for the Robert Crais set? I will say to you, jump right in, don't wait, Elvis Cole is about as good as it gets. And Joe Pike is partner in the detective agency is one bad... This is the first book and I enjoyed it so much. Good story/mystery, good intro to characters, great humor, it just doesn't get any better. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the book and look forward to the next Elvis Cole mystery."
2,A Book That Is Neither Good Or Bad,"I don't understand all the hype to this. It wasn't that great. It wasn't a bad read, it was just mediocre. It was a bit boring and cliche. I don't know. I guess I feel like this because I have read the better books out there. Maybe I am trying to compare this one with the better ones. There are moments throughout the book that makes it worth the price though. There are many more books that are much better, so I would pass on this one."
1,Terrible Design,I used this tuner for about a day and a half and the little blue grippers fell off. I tried to put them back on to no avail. I tried to replicate their purpose with duct tape. No go. The thing wouldn't stay on my horn. Wish I had my money back.
3,Dont Buy Belkin Speaker Cables!,"Had to replace these after one on the original cables broke. I first contacted Belkin who has the WORST customer service! I found these replacements on Amazon, great price and shipping! DO NOT BUY BELKIN SPEAKER CABLES! They look good(and big) but they are just 14 gauage wires with REAL CHEAP pins!"
4,A compelling and entertaining read,"""Brothers and Sisters"" not only provides an insightful look at racial issues but also provides an entertaining story of love, work politics and betrayal. Bebe Moore Campbell makes some sharp observations about racial attitudes (her comment about Bosnians just off the boat receiving better treatment in shops than black Americans is right on the mark) although some of her observations are a bit repetitious (e.g. the vignette about not receiving the restaurant bill). Still, a wonderful and thoughtful book."
4,An interesting read,"I enjoyed this book for the most part, even though the main character irked me. She was a bit too snobby for my taste, and the issues of race got tiring after awhile. But overall, I really liked this book; I stayed up all night to finish it, and the ending was pretty satisfying. The book teaches one to examine what keeps people from other races from being friends. But I thought Esther took things too personally. She thought everything had to do with race. Sometimes you just have to ignore the ignorant."
3,Brothers and Sisters is an excellent book to read!,"This book tells a realistic story about the conflict of different backgrounds. Esther, a black female, and Mallory, a white, female try to become friends but the color of their skin is what makes them not close to each other because of the riot happen in L.A. I recommend this book because everyone should know and learn about what is going on in our society between two races, black and white."
2,It was not as good as I everyone said it was.,"I read the book because I had just finished another one of Campbells book and wanted to study her writing style. This book to me seemed very diffrent from ""Your Blues aint Like Mine"". It was not as good as the first book. Though still interesting it could not hold my attention exspeically chapter four where nothing much happens."
4,Racial differences,"Esther Jackson is a strikingly beautiful black woman, well educated who, by sheer hard work and determination, has forged herself a place in the upper eschelon of the banking world. She is striving to become a loans officer, knowing that she has the ability to go all the way to the top of her profession but being held back by the glass ceiling which stalls women and black women in particular. Her unlikely friend is a blonde, beautiful Valley girl who has had all the advantages of a wealthy background but lacks the one thing she craves, the love of her father. She has been trying to compensate for this lack with a series of affairs with older, successful married men, only to be rejected time and time again. Their story and the story of their friendship which struggles almost daily to overcome the differences in their cultures, is a most interesting one, with prejudices of both races coming to the fore...I dound it to be most illuminating."
4,An entertaining and insightful book,"Campbell goes beyond the slogans and prejudices to tell the story of two women - one black, one white - trying to forge a genuine friendship in the aftermath of the L.A. riots. Their different interpretations of situations and even words are depicted with compassion and a great deal of humor as they try to find common ground. Even when they clash, we can understand where each is coming from.As if navigating the waters of racial sensitivity weren't daunting enough, the characters are also faced with tough choices about career, dating, family, office politics and other ethical dilemmas that often seem to demand conflicting solutions. There are lots of other well-drawn characters, some with good intentions, some with bad and some caught up in a confusion of both. Who would have thought a book about people who work in a bank could be so suspenseful and rewarding?"
5,A jazz guitarist listens to guitar jazz,"This 3 disk set is an incredible value. The recordings are stylisticly varied and include standards, latin, bossa nova and more modern tunes as well.Both John and Bucky are in fine form and play their fingers off. It's a jazzin' good time."
4,love the book presintation was a little off,needs to be more plan and simple on inside loved the cover and dont like that it has crowley on spine of book because in a strange way the book does pseudonym.
5,"This book is by many,far misunderstood.","I have owned the Liber Legis now for nearly 6 years. Aleister crowley certainly did not write this for the idiot or the fool. For this writing holds the secrets of all existance, waiting to be expounded. The conciousness of the continuity of existence, this is the threefold book of the Law of Thelema. It is required material to the student of the thelemic arts, or to any system of magick related to Crowley, the Argentum Astrum, Golden Dawn etc....this is a must have! This is the holiest writing in the whole world!"
5,"Best price, fast shipping","One of the best prices and shipping cost on the web. Fast shipping, and quality HP products."
5,I love this hat.,No mosquitoes are going to mess with me now. muhahaha I should have ordered a larger one though but I still think it's good quality.
2,Disappointed,"I read some scary reviews about the cheaper, made in China, spring compressors. I paid $17 and change for this tool. It was the most expersive one that I saw. The first thing that I saw when I unpacked it was ""made in China"" I could have bought this tool at my local Harbor Freight store for $8. Although it worked, the two compression arms (jaws) were drifting away from each other sideways more and more as I tightened the compressing nut. Made me a bit nervous. The instructions say to use a 1/2 inch wrench to open and close the jaws. Not so. The nut actually required a 13mm metric wrench. If I had it to do over, I would have gone to Harbor Freight and saved $9."
4,Helpful,I have used this product for a couple of years now and do not like to be without it. It seems us seniors have more difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep than younger people. I take melatonin along with a mild otc sleeping pill and I sleep all night.
2,Doesn't keep me asleep,"This product makes me sleepy but my main issue is staying asleep so this product doesn't help me out much. It might be different for others, but I have a very high tolerance for certain drugs and ingredients. I tried taking two pills but that didn't help either."
5,The New Jerome Biblical Commentary,An interesting and scholarly reference for the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures which conveys an welcome and informed context for the sacred text.
1,liberal slop,The work is from a bunch of liberals. Most any other commenary surpasses it. Of note is their accusation that Luke was in error in Luke 2:1. These liberal Humanists in clerical dress are the ones in error. Don't waste ten cents on the work.
5,Surprisingly The Good Quality,Usually things like this while not a major bit of supply have a range in the quality of make. But this was a nice surprise to find out that this one was of the top quality type and when one orders these items one can only hope. I was glad to discover this.
1,Not great....,The snap fastener for the badge was always coming unsnapped and didn't really have the holding power necessary to keep the badge attached. My badge was always falling off and getting lost. I eventually had to stop using the product.
1,this is not replacement keyboard for Inspiron 8600,"my bad for not seeing comment that connector not included. removing the old connector (to reuse) is almost impossible without instruction. spoke to Jerry at Sunvalleytek who issued RMA for return. following day Jerry advises that his boss, Juanita said they won't RMA as webpage states connector not included. either way keyboard isn't replacement assembly if connector isn't available/reusable/with dissassembly instruction."
2,dont purchase not worth the money,"I purchesed this product and returned it back. The bike trailer not comfortable for kids at all. The worst thing of it is the bar from the jogger folds underneath the seat were the child is sitting, so when you hit a bump they bounce on a bar. So not to comforable! Found another bike trailer jogger at costco the Xterra Excursion for $150 much better and has a suspension."
5,Very well constructed,This has been a great knife so far. Love the options for carrying and it is tough. It's fairly heavy but I haven't minded.
3,Good solid knife with so so sheath and straps.,"Great Gerber quality knife. Holds an edge and is very sharp. Sheath seems to made out of cheap plastic and straps are even cheaper. Think Vietnam or China for the straps. Has some rubber type grip style lines on the coyote tan straps. The color is also not the same as many other coyote tan items. If you are buying this for military use, be sure that your gear looks the same color or is authorized. Many USMC units have bought these for deploying personnel. Add some parachute cord to the handle and the knife is made even better. Can be lashed to a stick for a speak and the back end of the knife is great for pounding tent stakes or breaking glass."
2,Are you kidding Gerber?,"This knife is no longer made of Sandvik steel as advertised! Instead you now get a 420HC blend - essentially the same found in cheap Dollar Store knives....If you're looking for a backpacking/camping knife suitable for making feather sticks/bushcraft this knife is not it. With the blade being so thick, serrated, and made of such cheap steel, it's almost impossible to get long, consistent, curling, feather sticks that are thin enough to take a magnesium spark.This knife is essentially a sharpened crowbar. It is more suitable for prying open metal containers and bashing out car windows on a battlefield than curling feather sticks and gutting trout on the trail."
4,Good textbook for web design advice,"I bought this book as the textbook to my ""Internet Commerce"" class for my MBA. We had to review and critique business websites, and this book provides a lot of guidance - checklists, must-haves, etc.It would be good for anyone who is studying, but also for anyone who wants to get a reference guide for their own website.JIM"
3,"Way too expensive, but a good product.","I just ordered the blue last week at thirty-four dollars and this weeks it has increased in price by over fifteen dollars!! What is that about??? These things are already expensive enough. I do like it and plan to use it for saving my child's school work and since I can't find anything else even comparable to this I am buying 3 more for my other children's school work. Obviously, NOT in blue because I refuse to pay FIFTY dollars for this thing. I would think 15 bucks is an appropriate price. If you can find something comparable, I would not spend so much money on these. I just haven't been able to find anything else. Other similar products with snaps on the sides do not stay snapped and you don't have to worry about that with this item. You just can't stack them as they are not strong enough."
3,"Nice Garden feature, but....","This bridge is nothing more than a nice garden feature. For the price I think that it is a very good product, and provides exacly what I was looking for to help boost the back yard garden decor. The build quality is a little more suspect. The first unit came with one of the side beams cracked right in the center. Perhaps in shipping, but unlikely. The replacement bridge came and where the posts attach to the side, the cedar walking slats were not cut short like the other locations and I had to cut them flush with the side of the bridge. I am handy, so this was easy to do with my coping saw, but if this was an all thumbs application, someone would be returning for a second time and requesting a third."
1,Not worth the money at any price,"I cleaned out my bookshelf and came across this booklet. I was astonished at how poorly it was written and how little information is actually provided. The booklet is extremely confusing and used very specialized slang terminology which would be unfamiliar to a novice or even intermediate horse person. It also provides no actual guidance on how to break and train any horse, despite its title. The booklet is over 30 years old, and it advocates some very old fashioned and cruel methods for ""breaking"" a horse. I consider myself a knowledgeable horse person, and I found almost nothing of use in this booklet. I would only purchase it if I wanted a very small window into poor horse practices and poor writing."
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT !,"I don't get it. The movie had this song playing twice , once during the movie and the second time at the end credits , and it was such a fantastic foot tapping single , and these guys din't include it in the soundtrack. What a bummer !. Really. I bought this album in anticipation of that song , but nope it wasn't there. I dont even know what the name of that song is , but it was soooooo damn catchy. I wonder if amazon will take the cd back and give me a refund. hmmm other than that it's an ok."
3,look elsewhere,"the gyp! the horror! the song that everybody loves isn't included -- the hook is ""the most loneliest day of my life"" and the title of the song is ""lonely boy"" by system of a down. the rest of the songs are so-so, except for ""don't make me wait"" by this world fair. the movie isn't exactly something you want to relive, so unless you were REALLY jamming to the soundtrack, pass on this and buy ""lonely boy"" on itunes."
2,"Move along, nothing to see here...","Closing in on ten years old, this album is sounding dated. You might consider shopping around for a better mix. Compilations are always a mixed bag, and this is no exception -- when I picked this up in '95, I only enjoyed a few of the funkier tracks. The rest were a bit repetitious and didn't find the groove I was looking for. Today, there's maybe one that I still enjoy."
1,Selling the Way...,"The book could be subtitled ""Look at Me, I'm a Zen Rebel"". It's annoying and tedious. Not suprising when someone who's job it is to make you believe you need stuff you don't tries to sell you on his enlightenment. Better to try ""Triumph of the Sparrow: Zen Poems of Shinkichi Takahashi""."
1,Should be titled transforming your life with raw fluff.,"I have recently starting eating a raw food ""vegan"" diet. Have lost lots of Lbs. and am always searching out more information how to live this new foodstyle. It is a foodstyle for me, not a lifestyle. I don't believe that I am saving the world or altering my cosmic consciousness. If you do, then you may enjoy this video, but there is little information(perhaps no information is more accurate)about doing the raw foodstyle. There is a lot of testimony about how great the world is when you eat raw food. I am really happy for what Philip has accomplished, but this is really kind of a ""religious"" new age experience talk and if that appeals to you then this may be a good video for you. But, if you are looking for real world, pragmatic information about living ""vegan"", then skip this one."
1,Review of Transforming your life with Raw Food,"Dont waste your time, this movie is horrible, its just a video of the guy on the cover telling his storyat a small gathering. You can spend your money on way better self help videos."
5,Incredible pocket resource,I cannot imagine practicing without this book in my lab coat. Indispensible information. Allows you to solidly build a case before approaching the physician. Great reference tables and information for solid clinical decision making.
2,Total failure for me too,"I have chinch bugs eating my St Augustine floratam grass (Ft Myers, Fl). I used that product to prevent them, and treat them with no success at all. I used a professional grade spreader to distribute the product evenly on my yard (2 pounds per 1000 sqf).I still have chinch bugs. I am switching to another product such as TALSTAR.Chinch bugs are known to be very resistant to most pesticides used even DDT."
5,"Comforting, old-timey projects! Good for snowy days!","As in all Tasha Tudor's books, the illustrations are stunning. Clear instructions make projects look possible!"
2,"54"" divider, no crate","I was confused by the pic and now i have this 54"" divider, with no crate to go with it, AWESOME! :("
5,The Best Wilderness Survival Knife,"I love the outdoors and practice wilderness survival on a regular basis. The Gerber LMF is the best knife i've found. I've tried 9 or 10 different brand names and this knife wins every time. This full tang, drop point, serrated blade is high quality and feels substantial in your hand. It's balanced nicely and is great In the fire, chopping wood, or smashing glass. This blade does it all. The muted colors are great for camo, and is compatible with any MOLLE system which fits nicely on any ruck or IBA. The sheath is well made with a built in sharper, and it also comes with a strap cutter (or at least it's supposed to, mine didn't). Even without the strap cutter this knife warrants 5 starsThe Best Survival Knife."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"this ""camera"" is a total waist of time and money DO NOT PURCHASE!! #1 it has terrable resolution #2 scraches easy and ""paint"" chips right off. #3 battery life sucks it lasts 15 or 20 minutes, if your lucky, with one AAA battery. take my advice, please!!"
1,POOR,"If there was a 0 stars I would have chose that. I am very, very disappointed with this item. I would have returned had it been worth it!!!! They included no packing slip to even be able to return it. It was a waste of my time to purchase and to open the package when it arrived. I will never buy anything again. Maybe even from amazon!!"
1,where can i get a cd-rom,My daughter recently got an innovage mini digital camera from a friend but without the software disc. Where can I get the software disc?Thanks
2,it's okay..,"i bought this camera, spur of the moment, i thought it was very cute..but i couldn't see the back of it through the packaging.It's nice..it takes 'ok' pictures..but i used it once. and that was it.it is pretty boring."
1,Useless camera,"Im so interested to buy this innovage digital camera.This camera is so useful,cheap and convenient.I bought this small digital camera last week.I took some pictures and download into my computer. It worked. When I download and transfer the pics the 2nd time,the camera didnt work anymore. Today, I returned this camera to the store.I recommend that You DONT buy this camera. If you want to take good pictures, buy the expensive camera brands like sony or canon. These camera brands are expensive.But it has high resolution, memory and megapixel."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,While inexpensive...it becomes an irrelavent point when it simply does not work.I purchased 2 for my daughters as stocking stuffers and we have tried repeatedly through all of the trouble shooting to get them to work with no success.
5,must have,Wonderful mat for my daughters room. Now that we have moved I removed all the letters from their blocks for the mat and use them to teach her the alphabet. MUST HAVE!
2,This has Lemon in it!!!,To whom it may concern. Please be advised that this product has Lemon in it and smells like plastic. You really can't smell the Chamomile...
1,Not a receiver tube cover!,"This is not a receiver tube cover! This item is receiver plug cover, I ordered as a receiver tube cover and discovered the error when item was shipped. This item slides on and covers your light plug box."
4,"The last one??? Oh, NO!!!","I read most of this series and enjoyed them all. Robin Vaughan is a delightful character, engaging and very human, and Carolyn Banks's descriptions of the horses' behaviour ring very true to anyone who knows even a little about horses. If this truly is the last in the series, it's a shame -- there are very few horse books for grownups, and I'd hate to lose this series."
2,Dissappointing,"This was a disappointment, after reading Death by Dressage. So much time was taken up by the narrator rambling down tracks that lead no where. This was a thin book to begin with, but the entire story could have been told in one chapter. I was really disappointed in this book and would not recommend it for others."
3,a good kit,I bought helicoils because they are good quality. I really like the fact that the kit includes everything you need for an install except a drill bit and wrench. The photo shows an installation tool that has a handle but the one that shipped was a straight piece of metal. A little disappointed.
3,dreary and boring,"I love some of McKillip's books, but this isn't one of them. Some I have read many times; I was unable to get up the interest to finish this one. Some cool parts but mostly boring."
4,A fantasy hiding behind a real world,"McKillip's language is dreamy. It leaves a wisp of an impression, makes you long to find out what it implies, how the story ends. The dialogues are riddles that are like warm sunlight bathing you early in the morning. Solsitice wood is different from the other books that I have read of hers in that, it is set in our real world - something we can all identify with. Sylvia and Tyler and the very human and vulnerable Iris. The characters are all endearing and I read the story cover to cover in one day - just couldnt put it down. Her magic is stronger in that it is set in real mundane world and her characters are people we can identify with readily. A must read - though Riddle Master trilogy still remains my favourite."
4,Enjoyed this album,I saw a documentary on PBS about Carla Bruni and liked her voice and decided to order this album. I have enjoyed listening to her as she brings a little bit of Paris into my living room.
4,The First Lady of France,Ms. Sarkozy has an enchanting voice; smooth and cheerful. Even the sad songs sound happy!
5,Carla Bruni,I had never heard of this artist before. I listened to the album briefly and fell in love with it. I love it that it's acoustic.
5,Happily Surprized,"Heard this CD for the first time yesterday in a shop. Had to stop the saleswoman to find out who was the enchanting singer. Very pleasantly surprized to discover that it was the first lady of France and that she indeed has talent. Her songs have that distant, breezy quality that is so very French - an undertone that says, ""I love this, but don't take me over seriously.""I had to go right out and buy it. Putting in this CD, it is instantly four in the afternoon on a Saturday in springtime, lovely."
1,"Warm, but only when new","When I first got these socks, I loved them. I wore them around the house to keep my feet warm, they were warm, stayed up, and didn't itch. What's not to like. I thought I finally found a pair of socks that I really liked.Now I'll never order another pair. I washed the socks once, both heels have holes in them. Also, they seem to lose some of their heat holding ability after their washed. They don't seem as warm. You would think with so many things going for these socks, that they'd put a little extra attention to the heal area. If you think it's me, I've had many other socks that I've worn for years, and they still don't have holes in the heel.If you don't mind wearing the socks once and throwing them away, I'd buy these, if not, find another brand."
1,Got a hole in them Literally on the first day of wear,"Wow, a hole where the big toe is within hours of wearing them? Not worth it. A real shame because they were keeping feet warm until they proved to be of such poor quality."
3,warm socks,These are warm and comfortable.My only complaint is that they are not very durable.The heels wore out in just one season.
1,BEWARE!! BAIT AND SWITCH!!,"I can't review this knife because I didn't receive it from Amazon. They sent me the ""Henckel's International Forged Pro"" version, not the ""Henckels Pro S"" they advertise!The Forged Pro, Model # 10227-181 is lightweight and made in China. The real thing is model number 31120-183, made in Germany.Amazon didn't acknowledge that they made a mistake, therefore I am returning the wrong knife and buying the right one elsewhere.I am not the only one who has been duped -- read the reviews and be careful!"
3,"Earbuds are great, the remote...","The earbuds work fine and are a great replacement for your damaged or lost set. The remote works and does what it should, but it would be helpful if there were a menu button so you can change from one downloaded CD to another. As it is now, you can only change between songs on the downloaded CD you are listening to with the remote, and when you want to get to another CD, you have to pick up the iPod and do it from there."
2,Outdated and not well written,"Prospective purchasers should be aware that this book was first published in 1982 and is thus very dated. Modern readers may not much be interested in Uri Geller, Doug Henning, or alleged UFO sightings that were barely news thirty years ago. Even were the book more current, I doubt I would have read much more than the 100 or so pages I struggled through. Mr Randi is a little full of himself and his sarcastic tone and attempts at witticisms got old quite quickly. The book suggests that the author himself is investigating and debunking various frauds and fallacies but instead he just addresses certain topics (the Bermuda Triangle, for example) and then just quotes from the research of others. Very poor."
1,Sorry James,"While I am a long-time fan of James Randi, this book was tedious (at best). Unfortunately the author goes on and on ad infinitum about subjects that really don't hold the readers interest. While it is very demonstrative of factual evidence, the chapters drag on as though the reader needs to be convinced and then reconvinced of the evidence. Each chapter seemed devoted to proving the obvious frauds (over and over) to the point where I was exclaiming ""Alright...I get it...now let's get on with it!"""
3,Just okay,"I wasn't thrilled with this book. I know it's a compilation of articles published individually, but they didn't hold together well as a whole.I've packed my books away for a move, so i can't tell you exacty what it is, but seem to remember the same phrase in nearly EVERY piece and almost the same exact paragraph over and over. I got sick of it after a while. Perhaps my focus on hold 'em biases me, though. Overall, Mr. Malmuth knows much more than i do about playing poker in a casino and i respect his ideas for that at the very least."
2,"2 and a half, really","Sorry to say this makes two disappointing ones in a row for the otherwise terrific Roddy Doyle.Here he essentially transcribes and edits his parents' memoirs. I couldn't help thinking what a great present this book is for his family. By the same token, this oral history doesn't contain a story that will knock the reader out. This criticism comes in spite of the facts that I can't help liking his parents and it was presented coherently. Predictably, the author's family background pales significantly to his characters'. That I should have counted on.Alternately, Kevin Kearns' often hilarious oral history series on pre-WWII inner-Dublin is definitely worthwhile."
4,Macro-history,"Anyone attempting a systematic study of Spanish Colonialism, and in particular in the Americas, would do well in reading this macro-history.Macro-history is chronologically expansive, an over-view, tripping through centuries to culminate around thematic matrixes, for those of us who've never finished reading one (admittedly me). Paul Johnson's Birth of the Modern is another good example of macro-history, though I have only referenced the same.Reading macro-histories, cover to cover, does give one a birds-eye view that allows you to think widely, laterally, before jumping headlong into profound ideas. Refreshingly satisfying was Truxillo's By the Sword and the Cross. It will serve very aptly for my Menéndez project."
1,Not for automotive use,Not for automotive use especially when it comes to removing crankshaft pulley/hamonic balancer on automobiles. What a waste. Can it be used on a bicycle?
5,from the trenches,"This is simply the best introduction to musical set theory in print, and one of the most pedagogically sound theory texts available for any topic. Straus writes exceedingly well, and his organization and pacing are excellent. This is not ""watered-down Allen Forte,"" it is a humane spin on rather abstract musical concepts in language musicians can understand. Forte's and Perle's works are invaluable to the discipline, but their books are almost unreadable.Straus's revised edition expands the repertoire only minimally (more could be done here), but the new exercises (particularly the composition sections) are an excellent addition. An average undergraduate class can make it through the text in a single semester with plenty of time left -- about four or five weeks -- to cover additional repertoire and topics.Dr. O"
4,Good introduction to 20th Century Theory,"This book is an excellent primer for the basics of twelve-tone and atonal theory. The book's biggest strength is its pedagogical approach and clarity of difficult concepts. One can attempt to learn atonal theory through Allen Forte's book (and many did), but much of his book is theoretical, not practical, causing difficulty in distilling the main topics. Fortunately Straus's book has been revised, so I hope the repertoire has been expanded a bit, to move beyond the canon composers (Bartok, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, etc). In short, if you're looking to understand the musical materials behind atonal music, this book is a fine place to start."
3,What's the deal?,I just bought this DVD @ Costco for $8.99. How do you justify tacking on an extra $4 that doesn't even include shipping & handling?Better luck on the next sale.
5,I think that this book is very good!,"Crown Duel is a very exciting and imaginative. It contains adventure, romance, trust, hope, and dispair... with a little bit of gold and greed. I enjoyed this book immensely."
3,good but not great,"I was actually dissappointed by this book. Having read and loved all of Tamora Pierce's Alanna series, I thought I would love this book. Another story of a woman in a man's place. An actual heroine fighting against all the odds. Unfortunately it wasn't as fun as it seemed. I couldn't get into the characters. They didn't seem real to me. While I can see Alanna and all her friends walking down the street, and me talking to them, I can't picture Mel at all. She is trapped in the world of the book, and didn't become alive for me. While I liked the potential for the plot, it was not as fully developed as it could have been. It just didn't come alive for me, and I coudl always put the book down, even at the so called climax of the book. I didn't really care what happened to the characters. I think you could enjoy this book, but I would wait to get it in paper back, as I feel silly having jumped and bought it in hardcover."
5,I can't wait for the next....,I am hooked!!! I have read all of Ms. Smith's novels and find that this one is the best. The writing takes you away and never brings you back. I can't wait until the next one is out.
5,I desire for more,"I was captivated from the beginning of the story and it kept my desire for more even after the story ended. It was beautifully written.Smith's story telling skill has hit an all-time high. I highly recommend this book!The story of Meliara begins in her old worn castle. The descriptions are so well done that I can place myself it the place and almost smell the scent being described.I was a bit disappointed at the end, perhaps it was because I wanted it to go on, perhaps I was disappointed at how it ended; I haven't quite decided since I just finished it last night.This story has changed my writing style (:"
1,Awful,This book was so bad that I actually keep it on the shelf so that I wont forget the author's name or the writing style. Nothing seemed coherent in this novel and the dialogue was awful.
5,Quite moving,The songs are so wonderful they take you away. The music on this album is so visual it would really be amazing in a movie. A Ridley Scott movie!
1,Duralex NOT durable!,"I bought these for use by my kids, since I wanted to get away from using plastic cups. We have a 2 year old, who sometimes drops things on the floor, so as soon as we got the glasses, we put one on the table and tipped it over the edge to see if it broke when it hit the floor. We wanted to test these glasses before our child used them. Sure enough, the glass shattered when it hit the floor. Broke into a million little pieces. I am so disappointed and can't let my kids use these glasses."
5,A must read for the Manson enthusiast,"I have read almost all of the books concerning the Tate-Labianca murders. And I have to say the Adam Gorightly's book is the most thought provoking I have read to date. He covers all aspects of the crime, from Manson's childhood up through the crimes. Gorightly then takes the story to the next level, bringing up conspiracy theories that you hope are not true. Unfortunately, I feel some are quite accurate. The connections made between Manson and other criminals from his era are quite interesting.To meet the characters involved in the story read ""Helter Skelter"" and ""The Family."" For some thought provoking insight into the story read ""THe Shadow over Santa Susana."" This is a must read."
3,a little out there.....,"Over all this book is pretty good I thought. It starts at the beginning and tells of how the family started and where they lived at different times and stuff they did, including the Tate/LaBianca murders. I found it very interesting all the different people that they met or ran around with at times. Some interesting stories there. I was a little turned off by conspiracy theories. Things about the C.I.A., magic, and satanism, etc. Personally I just do not buy that they were all that into that stuff or that it was any big reason for the murders. When you read any of the actual killers books or Paul Watkins book they do not really mention any of that kind of stuff. Like I said before it is a good book and interesting but I think there are better books out there with proven facts. gaardtj"
1,A Public Service Warning,My Friend Stretch Armstrong gave me this book and I was lost - I then called the author who seems to be joing about most of it. Scary waste of time
4,Not bad,"A very good effort, although it falls short of ""Manson File"" in the respect that it doesn't delve quite so deeply into Manson as a person rather than just a case number.However it is quite refreshing that this book was able to ignore the preconceived notion of Manson and his family as a group of braindead, primarily satanic, drug abusing hippie fascists."
1,bad design and plastic material,"the suction mount's adjustable angles maybe only fit some cars' windshields but would also unfit for other cars'. i've tried and tried to put it on 2 of my cars, but no matter how i tried, the screen of the c330 would only face downward. i've unscrewed the two screws and tried to reverse the position of the upper holding part, but it just won't do. the only way to make this stupid suction mount is to attach some 3m double-side stick strips on the suction cup and glue it on the dashboard. but by doing so, the whole mount simply became so high like palm tree grow out of the dashboard. believe me, i've tried every angle to suck it on the windshield but it just not right."
1,read within 3 minutes,"all that was said can be found on the first page or home page of many cleaning services. Nothing new, nothing that someone with common sence wouldn't already know about."
2,awful,Hmm. A album full of every genre of music there ever was. The only tracks I enjoy are finally and another one. I forget the title.
4,"Aw, hell...","Aw, hell, you can intellectualize it all you want, but the bottom line here is: Fergie is HOT, and this disk ROCKS! All the rest is just chin-wagging intellectual hogwash, just put on the disk and dance!"
3,2 Track Pony,Get it if you love the tracks that are out. Not much more than what you've already heard will come out of this CD.
3,weird sound,I bought this cd and there was a sound on song ten that sounded like the cd was scratched so I bought another cd and it had the same sound.
2,I guess all songs must be about love...or money?,"I'm sorry...but although the song ""glamorous"" is fine and dandy..does it not sound a bit alongst the lines of Gwen Stefani's ""Luxurious""?I guess this is why i always prefered Indie music- the lyrics might not always make sense to the listener and perhaps it might come down to a bunch of odd sounds but at least it's not the same stuff over and over.... But i guess that will change as well...PS: not a kid...just don't feel like signing in...."
2,Fergie's first album EXPLODES on the music scene - and right into the dumpster,"I really wanted this CD cuz I love Fergie's singles. So I bought it. I listened to it. I hated half the tracks. Then slowly, i started hating all of them except her singles. So really it's not worth buying the album, you might as well download the singles. She has talent, but her voice sounds bad in every song except the singles! I give it 2 stars, one cuz she has talent and one cuz the singles are good. That's it. On the upside, the CD makes a GREAT frisbee for my dog :]don't buy this - save urself 18 dollars"
3,It's a Fergalicious Deluxxxe,"Fergie ""The Dutchess Deluxe Edition"" 20081. Fergalicious (5 Stars)2. Clumsy (4 Stars)3. All That I Got (4 Stars)4. London Bridge (5 Stars)5. Pedestal (5 Stars)6. Voodoo Doll (4 Stars)7. Glamorous (5 Stars)8. Velvet (3 Stars)9. Big Girls Don't Cry (5 Stars)10. Mary Jane Shoes (2 Stars)11. Losing My Ground (4 Stars)12. Finally (3 Stars)13. Barracuda (4 Stars)14. Party People (4 Stars)15. Clumsy (Collipark Remix) (5 Stars)16. Labels or Love (5 Stars)Here you have it! The Deluxxxe Edition is here. Though it isn't new, it's still popular throughout time. Many websites say that people only buy her original album instead of this deluxe edition because this version has the less-liked music that people don't want. I've gotta tell you guys that I've bought this album with disappointment that many people have had. If I were you, I wouldn't buy this and if I were you, I'd just download ""Party People"" online and be done with it."
3,Good party music,"I believe this CD is great to listen to if you want to be put in a great mood. I have fun dancing and singing along but I would warn buyers not to buy this for younger listeners because some the lyrics are risque. I also warn buyers that this is not a CD you buy for content value since Fergie's singing skills and lyrics are not the best, it is just a CD with good beats to dance to."
1,since britney...Fergie is the new Scorge of the musical world!,"Meet the new scorge of the musical world. Crappy music that is. Anyone who listens to decent music will find the song's on this album pointless and horrid.. espessially the overplayed whiney b*tch tune ""Big girl's don't cry"" Anyone would cry if they were forced to listen to such garbage!!! AVOID like black plague!"
1,Disappointing!!!!!!,"Disappointing!!!!!!I wonder if Fergie has any say in if a re-release of her 1st debut album is necessary or not. She probably does, i mean she isn't recording new songs for her health. Anyways artist these days really ruin things with their re-releases. It is such a double dip effort. She could have just released the 4 songs as an EP or recorded a whole new album. It has been 2 years since the Dutchess was released so maybe it was time 4 a new album. I am so disappointed by this. The funny thing is i don't know 1 person who owns the Fergie CD. So was it that big of a success in terms of album sales that it garners a re-release with extra tracks? Most likely not and if that's the case why not just release a new album. Only get this if you haven't already picked up the 1st release.I can't believe Beyonce & Justin did this as well. Only Mariah's re-release was worth it because it came with a DVD. Don't re-release unless your gonna offer something spectacular."
2,What a surprise...,"Okay, so I admit to being a bit naive when it comes to buying music. I saw the explicit lyrics warning but couldn't figure out why it was there, I'd heard the CD and it seemed okay to me. I looked through all the reviews, no one said there was a ""clean"" version. Well, now I have a CD that I can't really listen to with kids around and will probably have to list it on eBay to get rid of it.When there are 2 versions of a CD (explicit vs. clean) it should be listed somewhere that there are 2. I like the CD. The music is upbeat and Fergie has a terrific voice but unless I'm by myself there is no way I can play this with a carfull of kids."
3,Dutchess,"While the dance tunes are catchy and fun, the slower songs don't match too well with Fergie's voice."
3,GREAT VOICE but...,"...she doesnt have the strongest tracks on her solo debut album. Fergie really does have an amazing voice that music lovers can relate to but she is so busy rapping & doing strange things with her voice on certain tracks that it can get annoying and i just like it when she is being herself & actually singing like on ""Big Girls Dont Cry"". But her voice is asked to do different things by the producer. Overall i brought the album despite the lead sinle not being the best. But i did find a few hidden gems in this solo debut. I would really like to see Fergie work with someone else besides Will.I.Am. I am sure other producers would make Fergie an even better artist then she currently. Like Gwen Stefani's 2nd album this really is an acquired taste if your gonna state that you love every track. Overall i really like her as an artist & look forward to her next solo album."
2,What?,I bought this for some teenage girls and thought that I might enjoy it too. Boy was I wrong. They don't really even like it and neither do I. There are only a couple of songs on the CD that are good. I should have just bought the singles.
1,PATHETIC!!,"This album is sooo boring! Track 1 and ""London Bridge"" were the only good songs, not saying that they're good, I mean, you can just listen to those at the internet. Tracks 2 and 5 are the ones that I never wnat to listen to again, so annoying! DON'T GET THIS!! I can't believe people are being fooled by MTV to get this CD again! Track 11 sounded like hip-hop mixed with pop rock, and the closing song was sooo boring! I skiped like more than half of this song! I think, the fact that Fergie's on solo is one GIANT mistake!"
4,My mom loved it!!,I got this perfume for my Mom (she's 51) as a Mother's Day gift and she absolutely loved it...have since gotten her the lotion/perfume/bath set for her birthday. Would definitely recommend it and it's cheaper than buying it in Spain!!
4,A classic in tragic horror,"I have a fetish for classic novels and have read just about everything from Pride and Prejudice to The Three Musketeers to Brom Stoker's Dracula, so naturally when I found a copy of Frankenstein at Barnes and Noble I bought it and was not disapointed. Written in that wonderfully poetic and intelectual style of the old masters of liturature it is a tale of Ambition, forbidden practices, horror, madness, anguish, and retribution. If you are the kind of person who expects a classic horror film type story full of gore and violence then you will be in for a disapointment. The real focus of the story is within the mind of good Doctor Frankenstien himself (who was actually quite young) and the monster he created. Also, if you only like happy endings, this book is not for you. If not, this is a great book only dampened by the fact that it is not longer. Fans of Dracula will love this story and thank God for the 'Little Ice Age' that brought this book into being."
3,It is a good book and many have read it and you should but..,"I don't think I would read it again. The text is flowery and hard to take in all the time. She [mary shelly] had an amazing way of capturing feelings... It has symbolism of Fruedism, Marxism, feminism and more...It represents all the horrrors of life and society."
4,THE KUBY DIMENSION,"The ""kuby Immunology"" textbook is valuable for a number of reasons, but the two most prominent ones are: its broad content, and its simplistic outlook. Of course, the authors of this book had beginners in mind when they planned for it, yet, it has got what it takes to arouse the curiosities of experienced learners. I like the moderate details that most of the chapters parade, and the illustrative figures were colourfully done. Each topic consists of an array of smooth-flowing information, which are buttressed by supportive charts and diagrams. Even the otherwise complex immunochemistry topics were dissected in details, and without pain. This textbook will encourage any immuno-phobic beginner, while at the same time provide lifelines for those in need of revision. The only thing that I will say against it is that its price is much higher than that of other comparable texts, (like the ""Roitt's Essential Immunology"")."
5,Possibly my favorite CD,What else can I say? The emotionally potent instumental style and the wrenching intensity of the vocals easily overcome any weakness in the lyrical content. This is one album you will listen to again and again. I can't recommend it enough.
4,Till they beat this One,"I'm probably to old to review this one!I'm Past 40; the first time I heard ""This __it Town"" from Live on radio, there! was something I've heard ""before"". This is their debut {I think) and the best album since ""ten"" from those Seattle boys, what was their name? Sorry! But I can still come home at any time of the day and enjoying this album all the way through. Live is a Long Song!"
2,short and simple,"This album is not worth buying compared to any other albums that were made near the same time. it has 2 good songs lighting strikes and selling the drama. Definatly do not buy, pick up some pearl jam or even candlebox, just basically anything is better. should actully be 1 star."
2,Disappointed So Far,"Extremely disappointed with this purchase so far. I bought it for my son's first birthday party. Set up in the backyard, it looks great. Watching toddlers play on it, shows its flaws. The bottom base is extremely flimsy. The upper platform is just as flimsy. No more than two toddlers should be on top or else the platform will bow. I realize it is a plastic playset. I just expected it to be stronger than it is. The directions were a bit confusing at times. Please note that Step 20 calls for bolt KK. This bolt is not long enough and you will have to go to a home improvement store and buy a longer one."
5,great customer service and product!!!,"I just received this off the shelf, off the hook album in perfect condition. I am glad that I added it to the Mathers collection! Thank you!"
1,Dated material. Believes bluffing a lot is good.,"Since I am a professional poker player, I actually hope that lots of players read this book and take its advice.In the introduction, the author starts off by saying:""I played for years in a weekly game in a university town"".This book shows it. Doubtful if he has ever played in Vegas or any other large cardroom for significant money. He actually recommends bluffing frequently. Hope he manages to sit in my game some time...All the examples are for Stud or Stud hi/lo split. The latest book in his bibliography is 1975 and the earliest is from 1940.Fortunately, I did not buy this book but checked it out from the library and skimmed through it in about 30 minutes. This book is a waste of time and money."
2,"Sorry, didn't buy from Amazon","It's not awful. Then again it is not particularly ""learned"". This is Crackerjacks, urban legend, ""doggie"" myth stuff. This author is hardly a serious scientist. I don't care how many letters she has after her name."
5,smooth shooter,"This is great for the price, picked it up for my wife an she loves it . I gave quit a bit for mine at the local bow shop an mine don't feel as good as the strap this strap has , great price"
5,Lovely,"Silvana Licursi, an Arb'resh (Italo-Albanian) singer from the town Portocannone (Purtkanuni) in Campobasso province, has given the world a great gift in recording these traditional Arb'resh selections. My only complaint is that the American packaging only provides the English translation of the lyrics, not the original Albanian.."
1,This CD is not,"Sorry , but this CD is nothing but a joke . Why can't people just listen to rock instead of pop ? Who cares if Ricky Martin was in Menudo . This boy band just insn't quite right for this blowy pop CD ."
1,Bad. Very Very Bad.,"This band and others like them, represent the worst of the 80's and the worst of music overall. Like junk food, this is junk music, and it doesn't even taste good. You've been warned."
3,Bought the Rio 900--then returned it,"Nice look, great control layout and quite good sound. However, it was a little to heavy for use during workouts, memory expansions are very expensive and I opted for the Rio S35 which is smaller, has a built in FM tuner and takes regular batteries so when the power goes out you can pop in a fresh battery."
1,Why?,"Why would anyone buy this outdated thing when Apple's iPod, with 5 GB (or 10 or 20) could be had for not very much more? Plus you get FireWire to boot!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought one and had to return in because of display problems, volume toggle switch problems, and file corruption issues. I was sent another one. Guess what? I still had the same issues. The hardware is not reliable and the devices ""freezes"" frequently. The only way to get it working is by removing the battery. Please heed my advice and buy from another manufacturer."
2,dont,These lights do not look anything like the picture. Where the light fixture actually mounts the the wall mount bracket feels flimsy. One good hurricane and it'll be broke
5,A serious guide to the whole shebang!,Very thorough and well rounded guide to electronic marketing. I like the way it treats the internet as just one of the tools to utilize and should be a required read for anyone who thinks that building a company through the internet is a simple step by step process of plug - in systems and methods. The internet is only one tool and she shows that to grow a company using electronic marketing is usually a very detailed process. I like that she has so many experts giving their first - hand knowledge. The tone is professional and thorough. Required reading if you are getting into this field for business reasons and understand that knowing your field is essential to starting a new business
5,Little Caesar CD,It arrived in a very short time after I ordered the CD. It was a Birthday gift for a friend.I looked all over & couldn't find it anywhere until i tryed Amazon. My friend is Very happy with the CD.
5,excellent yoga mat,"I've used this mat everyday for what must be three years now, and it's still in excellent condition.Everything a yoga mat needs to be - light, non-slip, and DURABLE!"
1,So Sad to See Cuba Gooding in this TERRIBLE Movie,"I'm a big Cuba Gooding fan and was sorry to see he'd accepted a role in this terrible movie... He's obviously dropped his standards to an all time low. This movie was filmed the majority of the time in a strip club, with several side shows of people doing the deed (couples, threesomes, in the bathroom & anywhere else they can find). Oh, and lets not forget the Virgin Mary that is INSIDE the CHURCH weeping and the members think it's a miracle from God... actually it's because she's full of cocaine! Then the Priest (Christian Slater) agrees to participate in a plot to kill the drug dealers, & allows it to take place INSIDE the CHURCH!!! There's a big shootout scene where the priest is actually chasing the bad guys between the pews, shooting & killing them. I feel the description of the movie is VERY misleading... while there's a LITTLE of the ""story"" described in the plot, it leaves out all the JUNK that takes place the MAJORITY of the time."
2,Be Still my mind,"This is one of those fantasy books that leaves you wondering,at the end, why you wasted your time. Sure, it may have beenmarginally interesting in the reading (the last quarter, anyway), butit leaves you with a feeling of ""so what?"". There are nocharacters you can really cheer for. Roddy is essentially a moron andthe rest are patheticly shallow. Where others found characterdevelopment, I found a story that didn't know its start and suredidn't know where it was going. I won't stand in line for any sequelbecause, frankly, I don't care what happens to the characters. Bottomline: Fast, ...read if you are looking for something to fill yourtime. END"
1,There are so many better books to read,"Written in first person (hard to do). The main character is pathetic (who cares?). What's with all the homosexual garbage? I could care less about young men spanking each other. This book was a waste of time and Feintuch is permanently off my list. I have read thousands of books and this was one of the worst. When I finally finished it, much to my dismay, it was not the end and more is to follow. Not for me! This book gives fantasy a black eye."
1,Not fun,"The Still is the first fantasy book I've read in a long time. For me, the book went very slow. Not enough action.However, the thing that irked me the most was the main character Rodrigo. I hated him. I almost threw the book to the floor because he was so annoying.To worn those about the plot, it isn't about wars and battles and magic. This book is simply about some princeling trying to secure votes for his kingship. Very boring indeed. When the plot seems to go toward an interesting and action packed story the book ends. Maybe I'll find part II better if it ever comes out."
1,This is probably the last David Feintuch book I'll read!,"Well, the Seafort Saga books were pretty good, though Seafort got a but irritating when he flew off the handle and when he went on about how he hurt everyone and his OATHS etc. etc.Prince Rodrigo is about 10 times worse in that department, plus he doesn't really do anything heroic until the last quarter of the book. If I'd known what was between about page 75 and 250 I'd have just skipped it (Just a VERY spoilt teenage winging/complaining/being a complete A**hole!) - I nearly threw the book in the garbage! The last hundred or so pages were OK, but the ending just kind of trails off to a vague sort of ?now he's started... maybe he'll prevail? thing! Presumably there's a sequel where something might happen?I read a lot of sience fiction and fantasy, and this is NOT enjoyable. So to really enjoy it, I think you'd have to be a massochist!Frankly I don't care what happens in the sequel!"
3,"Pass the cane, time for another 15 year old to flog !","The HOPE Saga, starts with similar scenes. The author sure has a whipping fettish which adds nothing to the plot. In The Still, this hero too, grows up eventually to save and run the kingdom. I was disappointed that the yarn was thin and a little trite. I was spoiled, the Seaforth Sagas set a high standard. If you want a Fantasy setting and the fight for the true crown, The Still will do. The sexual involvement with the older male teen was a crutch for a weak plot, as in most books; Feintuch is capable of better work."
5,This is a wonderful book!!,"First of all, I'm a girl posting this review. I was in junior high when I first picked up this book and I haven't put it down. Kel is a spledid character and, in my opinion, the most believable in the Tortall series. She's quiet, thoughtful, energetic, and the only main character in the four series who doesn't have magic. In her stories, Kel represents the ordinary girl trying to accomplish something extraordinary. This one doesn't have the big adventure aspect to it, but make no mistake. With a strong cast of characters, friend and foe, this story is great. Each of the main supporting characters, such as Neal, Roald, Joren, and Wyldon, feel like real people and have a great depth about them. People of all ages trying to fit in with whatever will be able to relate to Kel and her struggles."
4,Sticker with no glue,"It is what it is, a static sticker using no glue. It is convenient to put on and take off"
3,An obvious mistake,"Mr. Maltin's review obviously refers to the film starring Leonardo di Caprio ""Romeo + Juliet"" and not to Mr. Nureyev's production of the celebrated ballet to Prokofiev's music.This production, staged in Italy is very similar to the one mr. Nureyev staged for the Paris Opera and should not be confused with MacMillan`s version for the Royal ballet."
3,gotta love those vikings,I love viking stories and this would have made a great one except that it could have used a bit more detail to give the characters more depth. The best part is the cover because he has a tattoo which very few romance cover models have!
3,"A few choice cuts, otherwise un-inspiring.","Very disappointing album. Given the quality of the single ""Fire up the Shoesaw,"" I had anticipated an album surpassing possibly even the great Fatboy Slim. A thoroughly average album, good to have on in the background. Worth the thirteen bucks."
2,Too cheesy,i don't know how anyone can think this album is as good as Pyromania or Hysteria. There are only about 2 good songs on the whole thing (Demolition Man and Promises) The rest of the songs blow. The lyrics are really weak and cliched. Been done a 1000 times before
3,Two steps back vs moving forward,"When I bought 'SLANG', I was at first wondering what happened to the Lep that I knew & loved ?! But after listening to the album a few times, it grew on me significantly. I took my hat off to the guys for having the guts to make such a departure from their formulaic pop-rock style.SO when 'EUPHORIA' came out, I went and bought it straight away. Unfortunately, it wasn't musical evolution I heard...it was a band in regression. Lep are much better than this album. All I can think is that the record company forced them back into the same ol same ol that sold so many albums in years gone by. Problem is...those were years gone by. I just wish they carry on experimenting and growing 'cos these guys have got talent. next time, don't sell yourselves short boys."
3,Euphoria leaves you High&Dry wanting something Retro-Active,"Don't get me wrong. This is a good CD, but it's not DL's best. Since losing Steve Clark and the ""Mutt"" Lange (full time) factor DL's sound has lost it's guitar edge and style. Not to mention that most of DL's biggest hits were written/arranged by Lange and Clark. Euphoria is missing that ""catch"" guitar hook at the begining of each song that previous albums had. Trust me, if you take any other DL CD (before ""Slang"") and use your ""intro scan"" you'll know every DL song just by the guitar intro. What tracks stand out on the new CD: 2,6,10,12&13 with tracks 1 & 8 getting honorable mention. This is hard to say since I've been a fan since 1981, but the new songs don't have the same ""punch"" that DL used to have. Where guitar riffs made you clench your fist like Joe Elliot's in the ""Rock of Ages"" video. Will it take another 4yrs until the next DL CD to find out if they really gets retro active. I'll just wait and see."
2,This is Def Leppard-Lite!,"Listening to the opening track, Demolition Man, I had high hopes for ""Euphoria"". However, my hopes were dashed after listening to one sappy ballad after another. The few real rockers like 21st Century Sha La La Girl and Back In Your Face keep this from being a total disaster. Those hoping for a revival of the Leppards of ""Pyromania"" and ""Hysteria"" will be sorely disappointed. The loss of Steve Clark has left a void from which they will apparently never recover. If you like Def Leppard-Lite, you'll love this CD. If you want to rock as with the Def Leppard of old, save your money."
2,FROM METAL TO BALLADS....,"DEF LEPPARD is a sad example of sell out... I can't even imagine that Vivian CAmpbell once recorded two amazing metal albuns with Dio, back in 1983 and 1984.... Now, he plays sugary and annoying ballads in Def Leppard.Leppard itself was a metal / hard rock band full of energy, a long time ago, back in England. Then, they slowly softened their sound until becoming so watery and shallow like Backstreet Boys and Hanson...EUPHORIA will bring them no new fans..."
1,BULIMIA!,"After listening to this sad travesty of an album I'm overwhelmed by the urge to retch and purge myself of the awful experience. It's a shame the Leps lack other marketable job skills, and are thus forced to remain in the music industry long after they have anything appealing to contribute. It's all been downhill for these guys since Steve Clark died--or should that be 'over the hill'? After listening to their latest attempt, I'm keenly embarrassed for them, since they apparently lack the good sense to be embarrassed for themselves. Rather than buy this CD, consider sending a contribution to the Def Lep retirement fund. It'll put us all out of our misery that much sooner."
5,Def Leppard reclaims it's title as pop-metal kings,"Def Leppard has done it again. Euphoria is the album which the fans have been waiting for. Euphoria is packed full of the energy which created the sound of Def Leppard. This album has a good mixture of old Hysteria sound, but has a touch of new direction such as the song ""All Night"". With songs such as Demolition Man, Promises, and Paper Sun, this album is definatly on its way to being a smashing success as it's previous counterparts of Hysteria, Pyromania, and Adrenalize. I strongly recommend this album."
3,A return to the 80s,"If you're a Def Leppard fan you'll not be disapointed with this record but it sounds like Adrenalize and has a few good songs that will catch you up, like 21 century sha la la la girl or Kings of Oblivion, and has a beautyful ballad called ""Goodbye"" the rest are just songs, obviously with the Def Leppard mark. It's a step back in the band carreer, a return to the 80s when they're in the end of the millenium. The worst of this is that the drums sounds like Hysteria.What happened to Rick's improvement with accoustic drums?! Of course Slang sounds more actual and it's a really step forward. Not bad at all but it's not a must have (like Adrenalize)."
5,Def Leppard still rocks our world!!!!!!!,"This album is by far the return of what I still feel is the best rock band for all others to be judged by. Def Leppard will always be the best for one reason, They Kick A--. Always have, always will. Joe and the boys should be especially proud of this album. From Demolition Man to Kings of Oblivion, Rock never sounded so good. Such a fresh sound, while still staying true to their roots. Rock and Roll is back!!!!! From the first track to the last I can honestly say that this is their best work to date. I felt like my ears opened again, after being closed for so long. Music these days seems to have lost all the flavor of yesteryear when Def Leppard ruled the charts. Likewise with this record I believe that there is some hope that maybe someday music will be something other than the music of the nineties. Buy this record, any TRUE FAN will love this record as much as I already do. {PEACE)"
2,Please bring back Mutt Lange,"Def Leppard needs their old producer back, badly. I bought this album when it came out and thought it was ok, but looking back on it, it's not very good. The production is WAY polished, even for these guys. No evidence of any dirty rock sound here, just clean clean clean..come on guys, throw some feeling in the mix, this thing sounds like it was performed and produced by a robot. it's not a terrible record, in fact if it was some new band rather than Def Lep, I'd think it was pretty damned good. But I can't even recall one song on this album..they've kind of gone in one ear, out the other. I don't think I've played this cd since last year, in fact it looks prime for selling to disc-go-round maybe. Die hard Lep fans will hate this review, but admit it guys, this is like listening to a Lep cover band or something. N'Sync sounds rawer than the songs on Euphoria. I'm sure they'll eventually put out another great record but Euphoria sure as hell isn't it."
3,A breath of fresh air but definitely not another Hysteria,"Def Leppard have produced an album that is a conciliatory exercise, alternating between the alt-funk of ""Slang"" and the 80s glam-rock ""Hysteria"" and ""Pyromania."" Sometimes it works; ""Paper Sun"" ""Kings of Oblivion"" and ""Promises"" stand out from the rest. Those that crave riffy, widdle-crazed speed-metal a la ""High and Dry"" will also not be disappointed - they will adore ""Demolition Man."" On the other hand ""It's Only Love"" and ""All Night"" are a dire, tasteless, dreary waste of space; pop-funk in the Prince mould is NOT what Leppard are good at!!On the whole this is a welcome break from the alternative sounds so prevalent in today's Hard Rock scene but if you are old enough to remember ""Hysteria"" (or have a copy) this is vastly inferior."
5,Def Lep Back In The Thick of Things in Euphoria !,One hot cd !! I picked it up the morning it was released and still have not stopped listening 4 days later ! Promises was the first cut I heard 4 weeks before Euphoria was released . It blew my socks off !!! The musuicanship on this Cd brings back memorys of Hysteria but with a softer edge on it . There was a couple of songs that I thought were garbage but the rest of the CD is Solid .Glad to see them back in the thick of it again
3,3 1/2 stars is my rating...,"I give this 3 1/2 stars...It's no Pyromania, for sure, but...they seem to be returning to form on this one a bit...from the opening ""Photograph""-esque opening to ""Promises"", the old school harmonized chorus to ""All Night"", and their instrumental piece, Def seem to be getting closer to the traditional Leppard sound. My only complaint are the 2 hip hop tracks and the real idiotic third track ""I'm Back"".......but I do like this album. Not as good as Pyromania, but hey...what is?"
2,Disappointing,"Despite its' name, this novel is predictable and too long. This is the first Case novel I have read but he has a habit of telegraphing his next move and gives hints which allowed me to figure this out halfway through. It might have been a little better if he developed his characters fully. Adrienne is especially dry and I found it hard to believe how she could be so businesslike in dealing with the death of her sister then witnessing the brutal murder of her friend. The ending was anticlimactic and not very satisfying."
4,Good like the Genesis Code,I've read almost all of Case's works and have like about half of them. I did like this one. You are very curious for 3/4ths of the book because you don't understand why some things are happening to the characters. But it all gets flushed out in the end. So far Genesis code is my favorite Case book and this would be number two.
2,Very average book,"This is a horrible book and took me forever to read, so unfortunately I've probably forgotten a lot of the reasons why I didn't like it. The beginning shows promise, with the kidnapping and mystery surgery on Lou McBride. Then Nicco Cope for no apparent reason assasinates a terminally ill old man. Both are obviously being manipulated by an evil organization.But then the next 400 pages or so switch gears and follow the plight of Dr. Jeffery Duran, Nicco's pshychologist, and Adrienne, her sister. Duran has also been affected by this evil organization, and the reader knows it from the beginning. But it takes 400 pages for Jeffery and Addrienne to figure out. Then in the last few pages or so, Case tells us what the ""Syndrome"" is all about, then throws in some action in the climax.Case's novels are getting progressivley worse. It'll be awhile before I try his new one."
1,The is a parady of the truth,"This movie was a joke, it isn't even close to what happen there? I was downtown when this happen and the protesters were not so ""quoate"" peaceful they were violent. I was attacked for not wanting to be involved in there stupid protest. I feel for the cops that day."
4,Great Book,Great book. Good series-will buy the rest of them. Hope to order several more in the next few weeks or less.
2,"Sturdy, But Inconvenient Case","This case came with my iPod, and so I tried it out for the first few weeks. I'm not a big fan for two reasons:1) If the case turns upside down (e.g. its on your belt and you bend over), the iPod falls out.2) You can't push the buttons while it's in the case. True, you can pull it up out the unopened top of the case and push the buttons, but I'm the kind of person who likes to jump around songs and albums. I prefer cases that have fronts that you can see the buttons through and push them through. Perhaps those types aren't as protective, but they work better for me."
2,Beware of gravity....,"This is a great case, unless you turn it upside down. It's a sleeve, and doesn't have a latch or snap at the top. This may not seem like much of a problem, but then I didn't expect to be turning it upside down. Accidentally. Five feet above a tile floor. (Okay, so Apple replaced my iPod after that one. But still, it was unpleasant.)The belt clip will only take limited abuse (as will any product). Mine broke last weekend while I was carrying too much luggage on vacation. A shoulder bag pushed too hard against the belt clip, and snapped it off.This product works well, but if your life is at all adventurous, try another product."
5,oem oil filter,"good filter, never have to buy another filter again, worth the few minutes to clean and no waste"
4,Increased power,"I bought the filter mainly to increase gas mileage on my 2002 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab but did not really notice a whole lot by the computer. I have not been on a highway trip yet since the filter was installed though. Most of the time you will not see a significant difference in your gas mileage unless you buy the whole intake system for $200 plus, but for $38 on Amazon with free shipping this product is worth the money.There was a noticeable mid-range power gain after the filter was installed."
2,Slow and boring,"I LOVE Scott Hamilton. The reason I love to watch Scott is because he is so full of energy and skates fun-to-watch programs. I was so disappointed in this DVD. I did not know who Michael Feinstein was, MOST of the music was very slow. If you like slow music, you will enjoy this dvd. But if you like high energy skating, you will be dissappointed."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"The DVD would not play on my DVD player but only on my computer. In addition, you can tell it was spliced because of the poor video playback. I would not recommend this DVD."
1,Not the best Animals songs collection!,Worse music I've ever heard it isn't really the original Animals band members performing on here just Eric Burdon himself. Don't get this CD it sucks i'll have to agree with other amazon customer reviewers terrible and awful sound of music not even close to their sixties classics they use to do for sure!
1,You Get What You Pay For! And I Didn't Pay A Lot.,"What a deal! The Best of EBATA for a mere pittance! But wait a minute, something's going on here. This music won't unlock the key to my memory. That's alright, I've still got my return label -- look out now! This does not meet my expectations. I was expecting the original recordings. No way to know unless you read the fine print that this is a re-do of the major hits, complete with a 90s electronics and occasional disco beat. Someone under 30 may not know the difference, but then someone under 30 isn't going to buy this music. I am generous with the 1-star rating only because you don't have a 0-star rating."
3,Not the Saga I know.,"Sounds very eighties pop in the worst way, definitely not prog-rock. Tell your ears to get ready to hear what sounds like ""Rough Trade"", a Canadian band from the eighties. Recommend their early stuff and absolutely get their latest ""House of Cards"""
2,When things went sour...,Saga turned into a stripped down pop band on this one. This CD just plain stinks along with Pain and Pleasure. I love this band but this one along with Pain and Displeasure are horrible. Stay away from these! I guess these are for completists only. I refuse to own this one. I had it on cassette back in the distant 80s and I sold it to a Richard Simmons lover.
5,Your Wildest Dreams,"This is a great CD. Not a bad song in the lot. Years later I listen to it regularly. Great songwriting and even better playing and singing. If you're disappointed in this, go back to playing with blocks in the sandbox...."
3,Three good songs on it..rest medicore,This cd has three good songs on it which are the first three tracks..especially don't put out the fire and only time will tell. The rest of the cd is pretty medicore..way too watered down..trying to be comercial in the worst way.
5,LOVE it!,"I have been using this cleanser for over 2 years now, and I love it! It takes only a tiny amount to clean my face. It smells great and I know that I am using something that is safe for my body - no parabens, or other harmful chemicals."
4,Awesome espionage and war battle scenes!,"If you like Buchan's 39 Steps, you'll enjoy Dick Haynay's next adventure. The first part of this story focuses on espionage throughout Scotland and beyond. I thought the story was wrapping up but it simply switched gears, going into overdrive as the reader is plunged into World War I, battling the Germans forces in France.I have thus far only read two of his works but I look forward to reading more of John Buchan!"
3,Book in fair condition,"The shipment of this book was timely. The book had several pages loose, but I was able to fix that."
1,This book wuz sorry,I think this book was horrible it didnt make any sense to me I thought the people from Peru were greedy and not thankful for anything they recieved form the anthropologists I think they just wanted them to stay in the in their area because they thought that they would bring them gifts and bow down to them just because they were from the states. I thought these people were disguisting and sick how can you have a husband and still have bofriends the only time that I felt any remorse for these people is when Cami died....... I think this book is not for readers that are interested in fictional stories.
1,ewwwwwwwwwww,"this book was too graphic for people of our young ageit talked about PERSONAL things and it was really gross.but we read it anyways because were very mature young ladies, amber and me, and besides the icky details, we liked it"
2,Lets say that if I didn't have to read it book..I WOULDN'T!,I wouldn't say this book is awful..it just wasn't interesting. I would't have wasted my time on it if I didn't have to. I don't think it had any point to it. I am a book reader and I wouldn't say this is my favorite book..It didn't end the best and it didn't really make much sense...but if you like books that talk about teen-agers having sex and getting married at a young age and having a lot of boyfriends while their husband is working..then this is your kind of book!
2,Not worthwhile,"Russell Oberlin had a beautiful voice when I heard him in the 1950s and 1960s. Unfortunately, this recording is too lacking in vitality for me to be able to recommend it. I's overly refined, rather effete, and, frankly, boring."
3,good planner wuth limitations,"Sunday's schedule would have been helpful. The binding system makes it difficult to insert a placer. Small pockets for notes and cards would have also been useful, But it is small and lightweight."
3,Well written but edged me into a yawn.,"The characters were well written and from the way everything else was described, I could just *feel* being in the Allfair; smelling the scents, watching the Footloose in awe as they paraded through the grounds; I love the characters or I hate them, which is a good thing, mind you. I especially like Saro Vingo (and I loathe Tanto to death), but halfway through the whole circus I just--got bored. And then I just knew what would happen to them towards the end of the book. Katla was alright; feisty, strong, sharp-tongued, yadda, yadda. I've seen too many of such women in fantasy. I like my women strong, but I'm tired of the mountain climbers and sword-weilders. Something new, please. ::scratches tummy:: It's possible that I'll still get the second book; it has good reviews, and it's not like I hated this one. I just thought it was too darn predictable, that's all."
1,Obviously book 1,"Katla is an interesting character, but she is one of the few that didn't plod along. The book is slow then picks up speed until several cliff hangers that won't be resolved until you plunk down another [price]. The situations the characters are left in seems more like the season ender on TV than in a well written book.Save your money, wait for the paperback or check it out of the library then buy someone that writes really good books."
1,Excellent premise - Disgusting execution!,"This trilogy has a great premise, as well as excellent character development. Unfortunately, it also has chapters and chapters of irrelevancy, needless yet constant gratuitous rapes, graffic female genitalia mutilation, and every descriptive vulgar word the English language has to offer. Most offensive is the ending: a goddess who, prior to dispatching the villian, sees fit to reward him with a parting hand-job! Some other reviewers found none of this offensive, and, therefore, perhaps you won't either. If you must read this trilogy, skip every three or four pages. You'll be doing yourself a favor and you won't miss much. Under no circumstances allow your children near it!"
4,First of three engrossing reads,"I am a Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan, and I really enjoyed reading this trilogy. There are a lot of characters to follow in the trilogy, which can be difficult to follow at times, especially in this first book. I think this is a worth-while read, though, because the story is interesting and the author ties everything together well. There are many instances of violence with graphic, sometimes gory detail throughout the book. If that type of thing bothers you, then I wouldn't read the book.Overall, this book was hard to put down, and I went straight out and bought the other 2 books of the trilogy to read."
2,Fair,"My title for this review basically states on how I feel about this game. If I can beat a game within 24 hours and not really remember the story then I'm definately not giving it a good review. The game play is too much like Devil May Cry. I must say the cutscenes were good, but that's it. I bought this the day it came out and also beat it the day it came out. If you like repeative, easy games than this is for you."
2,Kind of dissapointed,"I am not a huge game buff by any means, but I know what I like. I like adventure role-playing games where there is an itellectual challange at some point. This game doesn't seem to offer that. Its more of a run around-smash-the-buttons type game. There is no exploration. No substanace. I'm glad I didn't pay too much for it, it's too bad though, I was really looking forward to getting into another really cool game. Too bad for me."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzeder,"Zeder is a huge snore-fest. The beginning starts off promisingly enough but it fails to deliver the goods. There isn't a scary moment in this entire film and why it's not for sale for those under 18 is beyond me. I probably had an edited copy. There is little to no gore, bad bad BAD acting and the soundtrack. That soundtrack, yikes! I wasn't expecting a Fulci-ish bloodfest but I was at least expecting to be entertained. Watch it only if you're having trouble sleeping. It took me three days to watch the entire film from beginning to end because I kept falling asleep. Ugh!"
3,Polar Heart rate monitor,"The system works fine. The problem comes when you have to change batteries. Not just a matter of switching, the watch has to be sent to the company. This so called service has a double price. An abnormal high fee for a simple battery change and you don't have a watch for two weeks."
3,"Nice, but...","It is good because it is really well made, good materials, very good quality and has nice tools as well.But the small screwdrivers requires something else to pull them out, because my nails do not seem to have enough force for that. This does not happens on my Victorinox, where everything is smooth and every tool can be pulled out effortlessly.In my opinion, this is very good compare to other regular stuff, but it is not as good compared to a Victorinox."
3,Leatherman CS4,"Quite small, but heavier compared to swiss folding knife(of course without pliers). Knife has good combination of tools. Front part of pliers needs to be little grinded (first tooth is much higher than the others), because there is a small hole thick as sheet of paper(with jaws put together) , so you haven't got full grip and same pressure. Half of handle which has cork screw is bit thicker than the other, so it feels strange in hand if used as knife. Material used for saw is quite thin, so its end part is too flexible to sides and you can't close it with one hand because it is always crashing to awl. Same the bottle opener is always crashing to cork screw. Wire cutter has also more material in sides of cutting surface which is causing double resistance if you are using pliers. I was expecting more from that renowned brand."
3,"Light weight tool, light weight jobs; not for the thirsty","Overall not a terrible tool as long as you keep it in perspective. Taking down a 70' dawn redwood, single-handing around the globe on a 100' yacht, whittling a totem pole ... this won't cut it. Need to trim a quarter inch leech line, tighten a non-life critical screw, break a slightly stuck wing nut, prune a half-inch branch ... this could save a trek to the toolroom & earn its modest price.The corkscrew is the only dead end: even with the handy can opener/lever (a neat idea in theory) it's barely long/strong enough to remove the corks I've tried. On a straight pull attempt the too-small handle bites your hand; if you can use the lever (which embeds the screw only about half of an already too short length) the lever skews, threatens to deform & possibly twist the whole tool. Either bring a certified corkscrew or opt for a screw cap & leave that 1811 Chateau D'Yquem for another day."
3,Not the perfect one,"I purchased my rampante last week and tested it for twice so far. I have to say I am kind of dissapointed because I thought these were the perfect soccer shoes for me. The truth is the shoes are a little bit too narrow, and there is no improvment in shooting compared to cheaper shoes. I used to have lotto primato before and the shooting accurecy is same in reebok rampante. However reebok rampante's heel comfort is way advance than lotto primato, or other cheaper shoes. Nonetheless if you don't wanna pay $200 for a puma or adidas predator mania, reebok might be the second choice for you."
4,This is Rough,"Racehoss is well written and easy to read. The story is tough, rough, ugly - but it is real. Life in some of our communities is very harsh, and equally bad in prison. I heard the author interviewed some years ago. You could not make this stuff up. There is a fortunate ending."
5,Drop ceiling projector mount,Product as desribed. Fits appropriately in drop ceiling space. Multiple mounting options. Good buy for money. Promptly shipped on time.
4,Great for little hands,"We love these brushes for water-painting the sidewalk and painting in the bathtub. My almost-two-year-old can easily grip and stroke with these. But I know he will outgrow them soon, as they are very fat and blunt and it is impossible to paint any details with them. The brushes also stain, but for a toddler I guess that doesn't matter, since they mix all the paints together anyway."
5,Unique and wonderful,"There have been many photography books about the earth; what makes this book special is not only that many of the photos show places, objects, and people that are rarely photographed, but also that the composition of all of the photos shows places, objects, and people as you've never seen before. I also found the references annoying at first, but without the references it is easier to lose yourself in the beautiful photographs. It is a book your grandchildren will marvel at decades from now."
5,Amazing aerial pictures,"This book has the most amazing aerial pictures I have ever seen. I have been following Mr. Arthus-Bertrand's work for some time now, and he has taken astonishing aerial pictures from all over the world. This book is simply his masterpiece.I was so eager to get hold of this book, I couldn't wait for it to be translated into English - I had to buy it in French !"
4,Loved it!,"I am a huge fan of Arthurian books, this one was told by Guinevere and well written. I'm on the third book of this trilogy & very sad to see it end. Will be looking forward to any other books by Persia Wooley!!"
5,Beyond the Sea is a very entertaining soundtrack,"Beyond the Sea is an excellent soundtrack. I didn't know that Kevin Spacey could sing so well. He croons the songs of Bobby Darin so well, I thought I was listening to the man himself. This CD put me in such a good mood. I can't wait to see the movie now. My favorite track is Mack The Knife which was a hit for Bobby Darin in 1959. I also loved the song Beyond The Sea. It is one of those classic songs I always hear at dances and parties. I love the sincerity in Kevin Spacey's voice on the track Simple Song of Freedom. Dream Lover is another standout track that I recognized on this CD. It is a very romantic song and one of Bobby Darin's biggest hits. Beyond the Sea is a very entertaining soundtrack."
3,"Some interesing, low-budget tricks","My background is in engineering photography (high-speed events), but I want to learn more about studio photography for marketing and demonstration. I purchased this at the same time I purchasedLight: Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic Lightingand Softbox lighting Techniques. This one was in the middle of the pack: not as good as Light:Science and Magic, but much more useful than Softbox. This book had some low-budget, low-tech, but fairly high concept techniques for tackling a variety of subjects. Unfortunately, I was looking for a more abstract approach than this."
4,Worth repeating,"Jeffrey Foucault is new to me. His sound on this disc catches at my heart and ear from start to finish. With a mix of folk, blues and country music, these songs have a brooding theme of travel but the bigger theme is one this indepentant music listener resonates with. I learned that Ghost Repeaters are empty radio stations that play demographically profiled playlists to wide sections of America. Echoes of American market culture from thousands of miles away are invading our airways the way epidemic sameness, bigbox stores, and faux news cycles through every state. The songs on Ghost Repeater reveal a story of love and uncertainty. Foucault's words reflect the poles of ""one part love and one part grief"" (#6) capturing his recent marriage and his delight in that to the heartache he feels looking at our country. Treat yourself well and listen to these songs"
4,Incredible Musician -- DO NOT MISS!,"I don't usually care to share my opinions, but I have to break my normal silence and rave about this musician. I'll agree with a previous reviewer that the album ""Ghost Repeater"" is a little more polished than his earlier two albums, and that it makes for a slightly weaker finished product. But this young musician is absolutely astonishing. His lyrics are beautiful and thought provoking, and his haunting music gets you in the ears and in the gut. I don't know what genre you'd consider his work -- Folk? Blues? Bluegrass? Americana? Country? Forget genres -- this album, and all of Jeffrey Foucault's previous works, are must-haves for anyone who enjoys truly American music."
5,Great show!!!,"Not only is it a great show, but hilarious how he introduces his crew. Adding more words because its required of me to add more. That's all I'm done."
3,Latch,"The latch on top the printer will only release one side! You have to jiggle the top, push and pull but it will come open. To fix this, tie a string around release lever and leave the string hanging out. The next time the top will not open, push the button and pull on the string. I know...... what a jury rig!! but it works."
1,Stay Away!!!!,"This is a terrible printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it since the install(which was easy. The print quality is marginal, the paper jams every day! I have tried 6 different paper types all the same result. The toner over spray or what ever the canister is under the front panel that is supposed to catch it leaks. The thing is noisy and poor quality. SATAY AWAY! I have an HP 4700 that is expensive but amazing, a Lexmark(noisy but great) and slew of B&W various models. NO other unit has caused so much trouble."
1,Just plain junk - bargain printer - sub-par support,"Bought it new 3 months ago, it wrapped paper around one of the rollers, (an internal roller you cannot access), Samsung has put me around and around in circles for 2 weeks over a warranty repair. So, into the junk pile it goes - let the buyer beware, you get what you pay for! And the thing is, they don't even care if people never buy their products again. Too bad they couldn't just stand behind their warranty....."
5,Beautiful - I just want to pet it,"I was in a kitchen store looking at these mixers, deciding which one I wanted and what color I liked. Their price was $299.00 before tax, so I got on the Amazon app and bought it for a steal with no tax or shipping fees. You can't beat a good bargain. As for the product itself, it is beautiful and works like a charm. It does what you expect it would do, and is easy to clean and assemble/disassemble. Do read the instruction booklet that comes along with it and look at the recipes that they feature as well as the tips and hints that they give for making bread, etc."
5,Love KitchenAid,I have always wanted a KitchenAid mixer and I am very happy with this one. I believe this mixer is better than the other brands and would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever considered getting one.
5,fabulous find,"The machine is top drawer. The only problem with the delivery is that it came in clear plastic so anyone could see what it was. I believe it should at least be covered in brown paper. Other than that, the item is in perfect shape and was the best price I could find by at least $25, thanks to the amazon $25 coupon... free shipping and no tax, I believe.... awesome!"
5,Kitchenaid Stand Mixer,I love this product. I have never owned such a nice mixer. It does so many things with the attachments it makes working in the kitchen fun!!!!
1,Used sold as new,"Just signed up for Amazon Prime and am extremely disappointed with the mixer sold and shipped to us as a new item. The box had visible dents on the bottom corner and along the top. I was concerned that it had been dropped. I purchased the item for my daughter as a Christmas gift so when she opened it, I told her to examine it closely for damage. The packaging appeared to have protected the mixer from direct damage but there were marks on the Artisan band, a mark in the mixer bowl and what appeared to be dried batter all along the top of the mixing wisk. My daughter remarked it appeared used and I had to agree. Was also missing the splash guard. We now have to ship it back and my daughter is without a gift."
4,"Wo, Dude!","Wo, Dude! This game is where it's at, Man! Like, it has the MoJo, bigtime. It's like a cool jive catfish with megathrills and gonzo action. It's the big enchilada, baby!! Don't blow a chance to add this funkadelic action to your arsenal. Tubular! And, by the way, its graphicular, too.If, perchance, you have the opportunity to avail yourself of this fine product, I believe you will relish the experience. The fine folks at Capcom have really outdone themselves in striving to make this product a dazzling tour de force for the senses. Simply exquisite.Percy ""Rapdaddy"" Thornquist, Jr."
5,First rate read!,"Murder and mayhem flow in the fresh, crisp waters of Alaska. CROW IN STOLEN COLORS is filled with noteworthy characters, Alaskan atmosphere and native life. The author generously included a map of the islands and waterways.Liza, a widow, has moved to Alaska to forget her painful past. She runs her own freight and book service to road less villages and has a new man in her life. When Liza finds James, a young boy, in the middle of a river she becomes protective of him. When she realizes James is a witness to a murder, Liza seeks out Lieutenant Howard. Together they try to solve the mystery and keep James out of the murders hands; what a job it turns out to be!Whew, there is enough suspense and close calls to turn a person blue. Marcia Simpson keeps her readers on their toes with this on the move mystery. The clues are passed out sufficiently then solved one by one; definitely a first-rate read.Brenda @ MyShelf.Com"
5,An Unbeatable Debut,"This is a splendid book, and for a first novel, equally marvelous. It'sdistinguished first of all by its setting, the mysterious Alaska Panhandle.The protagonist, Liza Romero, has found refuge from her past in Wrangell, arough and ready town, which survives, as do all in the area, by fishing orlogging.A Tlingit boy named James washes up from a rocky shoal and finds safety inher boat, bringing with him dangers that begin to threaten her life. Theauthor portrays only too realistically the perils of sailing in those frigidwaters. The heart of the novel is a fight for an endangered culture, whichbuilds to a fearful fight at a mountain top. Along with the other eccentriccharacters in the tiny town, Liza must ask herself questions which defineher new life...if she dares to answer."
5,Lovely silky feel works for me!,I am very happy with my silk pillow case. It has prevented the awful sleep lines and creases. I will now proceed to order more. . .
4,Sisterchicks in Gondolas,"Sisterchicks in Gondolas by Robin Jones Gunn is the story of sister-in-laws Jenna and Sue. An old contact asks Jenna to come to Venice, Italy to cook for a small retreat group and as an added bonus she gets to bring a friend. Jenna immediately thinks of her sister-in-law Sue who (a) could use a break from a rough couple of years and (b) can actually cook. Despite different personalities and approaches to travel, these sisters of the heart lean on each other while God does an amazing work in each of their lives.While I am not new to books by Robin Jones Gunn, this was my first Sisterchicks novel. It was charming and a lot of fun to read. It is just a good reminder that no matter what your stage in life is, God isn't done with us and has plans to use us if we let Him. Overall, a good afternoon read.Thanks to Multnomah Publishing for providing me a free copy of this book to review in exchange for my honest opinion. I was not required to write a favorable a review."
2,OK...Give ME somthing more!,"One word ""Croatoan."" If you watch the tv show Supernatural you will know...but if you haven't ...or have not learned it in school...ur lost...just give us something! srry bad movie"
3,I Existed...What?,"Okay, I didn't get this movie at all. There was a lot of nothing going on in this movie with no plot. I'm still left wandering if the vanished died, were raptured, or in a parallel space in time..."
2,More T.V. than movie,"This is intersting idea that never lifts off. I never feel for the actors to give me much insterest for the movie. Although each individual does a great job in delivering, there no organzation. The movie in short is about 5people coming 2gether 2survive a(shadow man thing) world were if the light go out on ya, you'er gone. Nothing left but a clump of clothes. After 25mins I didn't care who lived and just let it play in the background as I folded|put away laundry. THIS is O. K. 4a free download, but DONT pay nothing. I recomend Night of the Comit an 80's flick with near same story better pictured. ;-)"
3,Zombie Movie Without the Zombies,"Director Brad Anderson is a less-is-more kind of guy. His best film, the low-budget horror film ""Session 9"", got by on the creepy atmosphere of an abandoned mental hospital with a few nasty shocks thrown in at the end. ""Vanishing on 7th Street"" is like that, except without the shocks. Instead of a single deserted building you have the mysteriously deserted streets of Detroit. Instead of monsters that prey on characters who wander off into the dark, you have characters preyed on by the dark itself. The post-apocalyptic setting and general refusal to make sense is reminiscent of ""Pulse"", but even that movie had a killer hitch-stepped ghost. For a while the abstractness is compelling and the cinematography (as you'd expect from a movie that makes lighting literally a matter of life and death) is great, but ultimately ""Vanishing on 7th Street"" disappears in a puff of its own vagueness."
3,Unsatisfying,It has a great premise with the promise that it could've been something specialbut it just simply does not deliver.The characters don't ask why this is happeningor come up with a survival plan.Satisfy your curiosity when Vanishing on 7th Street comes to red box for a dollar in a few months.
2,I paid 11 dollars for 4 actors and some shadow puppets.,"The pacing was off, the execution nonsensical, and the material was not at all engaging. At no point in the film did I feel for any of the characters - as much as I love John Leguizamo, this was just boring.Pro: it occupied me for a little over an hour."
5,Great durable product,"I thought I ordered a cheap-o plastic fireman hat for my son, but this is a hard, durable product. Well worth the minimal price for this! 100% guarantee this product!!"
2,Too small!,"I agree with a previous reviewer. It did not fit my 18 month old's head. Granted, he has a rather big head, but as one of the previous reviewers stated, it won't fit a 3 yr old with a head circumference in the 50th percentile range (which is where my kid's head is if you went across the growth chart). I bought it because it said it was for kids 3 and up, so I thought it would fit my son's head. Oh well. The search continues. In terms of durability, it seems rather sturdy and heavy, so I'd imagine it would last quite a while. It's made out of hard plastic."
1,JCIT's Quantum Leap,"Although the overall approach is reasonable, it has not been invented by Constanza. It is my opinion that this is just ""new"" marketing of an old good idea.As for the book itself -- is primitively written, fails to explore notions that need exploring and, at the same time, wastes pages explaining simplest things, including even formulas (something like ""... quantity would be 120 times 17 times 2 divided by 7.5..."" -- you got the picture).Overall, very dissatisfied with the book."
4,every breath by nils lofgren,very good music...I am and have always been surprised by why Nils has not had larger commercial acclaim than he has had...he is very talented and his music is better than 75% of what is being played on radio or tv
5,Pleasing & Fulfilling,"It's truely a shame that YA fantasy authors aren't reconized as one of the pack. Court Duel is one of the few best, funnest, and fufilling sequels I have ever read. So many shocks and laughing came from this book- wondering who the admirer was, if Shevraeth Marquise was worth the time- Court duel and Crown duel (prequal) connected together perfectly, what was not finished in the first book was finished in the second. You finish the book, wishing there would be another story about Meliara, but also thanking the author for making everything that should have happened to the characters, happen."
2,Not what was advertised,I ordered this book because it was described as in 'Used-Very Good' condition. When I received it there was a crack down the binding and it was an ex-library copy which was not mentioned in the description. Not satisfied with the product at all.
5,Buy This book,"This is just one of those rare specially creative fantasies with an unpredictable plot. I just loved the characters, the scenes, and the action (did I mention the tad bit of romance?) Well, all in all, Buy this book! You won't regret it!"
5,Emotional SPIRALING STORY,"Reading ""Court Duel"" was an incredible experience. While I was made aware of the premise by the person who recommended the book, I was anticipating the focus to be entirely on Meliara (like in the first). I was not prepared for the emotional spiraling of the Marquise of Shevreath/Vidanric, and many times found that I had to stop reading after a few pages to fully process what was happening with and to him. One of the few fantasy novels to elicit from me such a reaction. A truly breathtaking gem."
3,"More comfortable, less audible","Nothing wrong with these in many uses, they are much more comfortable than the ""security"" headsets we went with, but you struggled once the ambient noise increased. The mikes worked great."
1,A worthless improvement,"While Midland did make improvements in their AVPH4 headsets as vs. the AVPH3 with regards to the wiring being much simpler; the earpiece of the AVPH4 is absolutely worthless. Midland considers this to be an ""in-the-ear"" design, but the truth of the matter is that there is not a snowballs chance in hell that this earpiece will ever fit into any human's ear. Not sure what they used for a model of a human ear to design this earpiece around/in, but it does not work. Wish that I could figure out how to reach Midland and ask them to consider re-working the design to something that might actually work. Don't waste your money on the AVPH4 Headset, it is unusable."
5,The Best of the Mega Man,All past Megaman games have been games of jumping and shooting right. In this new game you as Lan can move around and collect battle chips to make your netnabbe the best of the best.
3,Preservatives...,"I really thought I had the answer to my Whole30 multivitamin conundrum here... Unfortunately, the product does contain a preservative: Potassium benzoate. I haven't read up on this particular preservative yet, but obviously it won't work for Whole30."
4,Cheese Slicer,I like the looks of the product. The handle is a little wobbly but it works just fine. They also sent a second wire - which is nice as a back=up.
4,Race-apalooza,"Auto Modellista is a fun racing game. It has realistic handling and great music. ANd the cel shading adds another awesome aspect to this game. It has a showcase of awesome real life cars, som you would only dream of owning. But you can race with right here. A definete must have. Race On!"
4,not bad,"Ignore the previous review. This game was not suppose to look real. the reason it looks like it was drawn out of a comic book was because it uses cell shading much like Zelda and Viewtiful Joe. Most racing games are realistic looking ,this one is not. If you don't mind the style, this is a solid game with many cars including models from Toyota, Honda etc besides the usual powerhouses. I recommend this game if you are tired of Nascar and F-1 cars. Some of these cars u can basically see on the street."
1,Not Worth 40$,Look The Only Reason I give this game a 1 is because I can't give it a zero. Seriously This Game Is so Horrible that even my local garbage man wouldn't take it. I've Got to say Capcom keep with the comics that way you wont get sued. If you have ever played Zelda for the gamecube you probly are used to the graphics but Capcom goes to a whole new world. I was a little annoyed by how it seemed like it was takeing some of the tracks from GT3. If you still want to find this game look 4 the racooon thing in the toilet isle.
2,Hardly impressive,"Only a leftist could have a book published in 2002 asking why no one knew of the horrific events which took place during the Russian Communist era. Apparently for such a literary person Amis never bothered to pick up even one book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn or other critics of the Soviet Union. Plenty of people were quite aware of the atrocities occurring in the Soviet Union *as they were occurring* and it was common knowledge in the 1950s in the West of the pogroms, jailings and killings. Read some Solzhenitsyn if you want a true study of the mindset that created the horrors of Russian communism."
1,Don't Know . . .,"Although it's been over a month since ordering the product, I am yet to receive it. Till I do, I can't say anything about the product."
2,It's an OK game,"Overall, it is a pretty good game. I thought the car graphics sucked, though. The steering and braking system also SUCKED...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!"
2,LIMITED APPLICATION FOR GENUINE SRA VICTIMS,"Although the book is well written and obviously well researched, this does not override the fact that the author(s) is very negative towards the memories of SRA victims, and encourages therapists to consider the majority of SRA memories as ""imaginary"" or ""enhanced"". Sad reflection on psychological counselling for victims."
1,an alternator that doesn't fit....,"Well, it LOOKED pretty and was sold as an alternator that was a fit for a 1982 corvette - not even close. It was about a full inch too small.oh yeah - and made in china! Please!"
2,"Love the tool, but it doesn't last.","I love the tool -- being able to open packages easily, strip wires, tighten screws, and open bottles is handy. This tool has exactly the right mix of blades and built-in scissors for my purposes.I've owned several tools like this over the last 12 years, and each one I've owned has worn out faster than the last. I've only had this knife 8 months, and the scissors are dull and barely work anymore, and there's a lot of play throughout the rest of the knife. It doesn't look like I can reasonably disassemble the knife to sharpen the scissor-blades (they're hinged by a rivet), or tighten up the play. Maybe if I learn some more machinist-skills, I'll be able to do it.Anyway, I wish I could find a knife exactly like this that would last for years -- or a knife like this one where I could disassemble it and service/replace parts that are worn out."
5,Really good - Buenisimo,"This is the best diccionary i have. I still use it and i bought it more than 3 years ago.Very good.Hasta hoy para mi, el mejor diccionario que tengo. Aun lo uso y eso que lo compre hace mas de tres años.Muy bueno."
3,Its Ok.,"Not that great, to me. It mences rather than chop into dice. But if it doesn't matter to you, then, it does that well. It not percise enough for me."
1,Badly underpowered,"I had an older model (20+ years older). The plastic attachment for the blade broke, so I decided to get a new Mini-Prep and replace the old one.Even using it at its highest speed, this one is so grossly underpowered that it can't even make a simple mayonnaise.Too bad, because it looks really cool."
2,Litte dissapointed after the first use,"This is my very first mini processor, i was so excited to get it for making baby puree. Its a good size for that purpose,small enough i can leave it on the counter top. However, i am disappointed after my first try. I put baby carrot and broccoli in it, used on HI as recommended, many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly, i can still see quite big chuck in it. I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before, and the texture turn out perfect, just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
5,Fantastic,"I Purchased this Small Food Processor to Not only be able to Chop Nuts and Veggies, But also to Chop Meat, Yes Meat. We tried 2 Other Smaller Units and when you would put Chopped Steak in them--the Blades would Jam.This Unit allows me to Take Steak--Cut it into Chunk Size Pieces and Puree it, For my Dog.The Motor Rocks--and there is no where else to Look for a Quality Smaller Food Processor. Lets Face it, Cuisinart Actually Invented the Food Processor."
1,"It's A Joke, Right?","Can't chop anything well. [Tried onions, tomatoes, celery, olives, nuts, and many other items.] Tried 2, 4, and 8-oz loads. Tried 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half ""as is"".I think it could ""mix"" 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler, blender, and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
3,"Good Product, Didn't Satisfy My Needs Though","I purchased the product in order to grind up veggies into small kibble for my dog. I needed them to be about 1/4-1/2 inch thick but the processor was only able to create shredded pieces. The final product was way too fine for my dog and thus I was unable to use the product for what I intended. However, the processor has a powerful motor and dual sided blades which would certainly aid in the kitchen when making salsa or something similar. Its truly easy to clean and very simple to use."
3,Adequate,No complaints about this bowl. The small size is fine for our needs but we don't prepare large or fancy meals very often. I bought a replacement bowl for my DLC-1SS because the bowl became really dingy and filthy-looking after using it to grind some allspice. The texture of the spice acted like sandpaper and scarred the inside surface and it looks dirty all of the time.
4,Very Good Processor,"Very good for the size and price. Sometimes a couple of larger pieces are left, but it usually works really well!"
2,Not man enough for the job,"I purchased this to replace an older model and thought I was getting a similar item but this is much more lightweight. So - not a replacement but I'll still review it objectively. It is inexpensive so it's components reflect the price point: lighter and flimsier. The base is not heavy and feels somewhat unstable. The bowl is difficult to line up and click into place, the blades's anchor is light cheap plastic and if I let it run for even an extremely short amount of time (say, to chop a few nuts) it starts overheating and a burning smell ensues. I would say that it's only use would be for extremely light chopping jobs or perhaps making mayonaise or salad dressings. That's not enough utility for me, so I will replace with a more expensive model that I hope will last like my original 20+year-old one which I've bequeathed to my son."
4,I bought a 2nd,"I love this little guy - so much so in fact, that I bought a 2nd one to replace the 1st one I bought after it started smoking when I ran peanuts through it to make homemade peanut butter (which was delicious). The 1st one was $3.00 from a garage sale so I was not shocked when it broke down. I will advise everyone that this is not a large food processor but if you're looking for something that will not take up space in your kitchen, the DLC-1BHC Mini-Prep is your guy!"
4,Watch Out!,"Watch out because the blades are sharp! Removing the blades and cleaning them is challenging and must be done very carefully to avoid getting cut fingers. As far as how well the Mini-Prep works on food I can say it is good and quick. I gave it four stars rather than five stars because of the design of the blade's ring which twists on and off of the removable post. It requires some amount of pressure to twist it off and on, but the edge of the blade is right where you need to handle the plastic nub on the ring to do so."
1,A flimsy piece of junk,"This ""mini processor"" looks nice, but doesn't work worth a darn: Most food gets plaster against the side of the container, and what gets stuck under the blades gets ground to a pulp. Add to that, the flimsy plastic ring that holds the two cutting blades cracks after a couple of uses, and Cuisinart wants $12 to replace it... half the price of another processor. Better to spend the money on another brand that will last."
1,Does not work,This processor does not work. This was a replacement for a Krupps processor and I only used it 3 times. I had to buy a Phillips to replace it.
4,Cusinart Mini Prep Processer,"I really should have read the title for this food processor a bit more carefully! It says ""mini"" and it is mini. It works great, looks swell, but it does not have the capacity I needed. Solely my fault for not really perusing the title more carefully."
1,hate it,"it does not do the job at all. I've bought it for preparing my baby's first food, but it does not pure even soft steamed carrot, leaves big chunks and I have to check very carefully and pick them up. just hate it!"
3,mislead by ad...,"nice product, but not what i thought it was. the description lead me to believe it was a food processor, not a food chopper. i was looking for a processor with changing blades for more uses. guess this one goes out as a christmas gift."
5,Very good food processor,"Bought this for my Mother who had her version from about 8-9 years ago finally die out. It looks almost identical (other than some minor cosmetical changes over the years) to her previous version.Judging from her original version, if it lasts at last as that, she'll be thrilled. Great little food processor."
4,Good value,Small and easy to use. I used it many times over the holiday season and it hasn't let me down yet. The only downside is that fingerprints show up very easily
5,2 year old grand daughter loves her baby,"We gave our Grand Daughter who turned 2 in September the doll ""Little Mommy: Child's first doll. She loves it, she pushes it around in the stroller we bought her. She hugs it and feeds it's bottle. She even sleeps with it sometimes."
4,Pretty good trash can,"This is a great item, does everything it says it does. The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because I purchased this for under the sink and not for out on the floor. The infrared senses the bottom of the sink and the lid remains open and will not close, which defeats the purpose of having a lid. Perhaps it was my lack of research but anyways it looks great and works great."
3,Pretty advanced stuff,"My rating is meaningless. I'm not ready to read this book. Why are you not offering ""The Songs of Milerepa"" or ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"" or a conprehensive collection of Sutras?"
2,Carolina Letdown,"CC was the first book of the WW (or Holt) series I skipped through. Book focuses on secondary story lines and skips the major players.If you are a fan of Sam Brentwood or Janessa Holt this MAY hold your interest. Toby, Tim and Hank Blake have minor parts.Just finished re-reading WW after a 20 year lag. Enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Found first book of The Holts to be one of the best thus far. Oklahoma Pride maintained the standard. Trust next book will get back on track."
1,Don't buy this item!,"I bought this item and it broke - literally the metal cracked and it cannot be used any longer. Not only that, the equipment overheats when used. You learn this quickly after you've burned yourself!!!If there was a way to return this - I would!!"
1,Worked for less than six months... beware,"Bought this to replace a similar mini-stair stepper I'd had for a few years. Worked fine at first. Got increasingly noisier over time, but these products usually do squeak and groan from friction. Thing finally broke today... cheap construction: although the little hydraulic shocks seem fine (they heat up on all models), tension is produced by a big plastic flywheel held in place by a metallic cable/cord (about 1' long, it forms a U over the flywheel producing tautness and tension, allowing a step to go up as you put your foot and weight down on the other step) eventually, this cord simply gives way... the wound metal of the cord snaps to the point where it loudly snaps apart with a loud pop. From the looks of it, it cannot be fixed and is now nothing more than junk.This product is not worth the price."
1,Not Recommended!,"This is the 1st mini stepper I've had, the calculator part never worked and there were no instructions so I should've returned it right away, but it worked otherwise, so I kept it. It made noise off and on and after only 14 months the cable just snapped and there are no replacement parts! I do not recommend buying this product!!!"
3,"Good reading, but not enough...","Sybex material is smooth and easy to read, with examples, and somewhat simple language. To me it wasn't informative enough. I belive those who are in the business of learning complex technologies, i.e. Cisco routing and switching, ought to indulge on tons of technical information. As many of the reviewers have stressed here, Cisco Press does it best; it's that simple. There is more detail all over the place, although some might find it a bit more difficult to read at first due to the strength of the topic, but if you are persistent enough and are digesting any of this information, you will be fine. Do yourself a favor, do not take any shortcuts, invest a few more bucks in quality material and go from there. Cisco Press does it best. Afterall, it's their own technology. :)"
1,Magellan is a rip off,"Magellan is a rip off; we bought the unit and didn't realize the only way to get any decent maps is to pay over $100 for the software to download the topographical maps. (The nearest street it shows us with the default maps is over 2 miles away and an interstate; the intervening space is just blank screen).These are the USGS maps that were paid for with taxpayer money, but Magellan requires you to buy its software; another hidden charge to consider when you buy ANY of their products."
5,Great new twist to megaman,I have played this game before and am getting it to own. Let me start by stating that this title does play as a side scroller with tons of power ups and upgrades and truckloads of possibilities especially for weapons creations. There are so many secrets and different routes through this game and I found it to be a very fun and challenging game. However MEGAMAN X COMMAND MISSION TOTALLY SUCKS. The only thing missing from network transmission is being able to play a new game as Zero. I have always preferred him over megaman since X4
3,Transmit this!,"This game seemed cool as soon as i checked the movies and screenshots, but now it seems almost impossible 2 beat the first level!!! Its been a day long since i rented this game, and i havent even beaten Fireman! Plus they should have translated the language 2 english. You cant go anywhere anyways in the beggining(except the stupid store). I highly recomend you just rent it for awhile. U better b a Mega man fan 2 like it."
4,Cool but with a few flaws,"awesome graphics but teeth clenchingly hard, it takes forever to beat the first level, the battlechip system is just not made for side-scrollers! the insane level of difficulty makes it a challenge for experts even! but it's still fun, I recommend renting it, (Ya gotta be a fan of Megaman or you'll hate it!)"
5,"A Great game, huh. (Ha ha Higsby)","I have played and beaten all three Battle Networks. They were great with an awsome, easy to pick up battle system, chips, a great story and full customization of MegaMan. Transmission is different though. Fans of the original sidescrollin' MegaMan will be able to relate to the left to right get-to-the-end-of-the-screen kind of thing. While Battle Network fans will lap up the story, characters etc. To be a true fan of this game you must love sidescrolling and RPg's. I LOVE battle network because it has all the great aspects of an RPG. Transmission is just strange. I miss controlling Lan and have to read sub-titles from Japanise dialog. Overall I liked this game and if it is hard then big whoop. Thats the point of a video game dummy."
4,Super,"This is a great mega man game. The beginning can be hard, but then you get the hang of it. The battle chips are alsome. The bosses get harder and harder. The graphics are great. The game play is great to. I really recomend this game to everyone who is a mega man fan."
1,Even hardcore fans are turned away,"Even the most hardcore MegaMan fans find themselves going, huh? I guess the game is based on the MegaMan TV show. I would just like to say this game sucks. It really does. Every so often you get a limited amout of weapons from the kid that owns you or something. (Since when is MegaMan owned by a kid, and not created by Dr. Light?) You go through the first level (the only one you can go on) fighting robots and eventually run out of weapons. (Sometimes the kid doesn't even give you any real attack weapons) After you use them, you lose them until you ""sign out"" it took me three days to beat the first ""boss"".I don't know what the creators were thinking when they made this game... It is a big turn down for hardcore fans.I don't mind a challenging game, but this game has a stupid plot, and a harder control. I would NOT recommend it...I gave up on it and returned it to the store I rented it from. I suggest you do the same, or not rent it/buy it at all."
1,stupid,"This game is a disgrace to the mega man name. It's horrible plain and simple. Ugly, too hard, stupid idea overall. Forget this and get X7 for PS2. much better."
3,It's an Interview with Trent and a couple other members.,"Only recommended to more hardcore fans. The quality of recording is terrible and it's hard to hear what they're saying. The first interview sounds as if it was conducted on a payphone in the middle of a shopping mall. The second is in the middle of a park or similar. I don't know if there was a third or even fourth because I didn't have the time or patience to listen to the whole thing. Which leads me to another point, it's all one track and there is no way to seek to each interview, just holding down the fast forward button for about 5 minutes to get back to where you left off.In conclusion, this is really only for people who love to suckle each and every one of Trents words like milk from their mother's teat."
5,"Exceptional, insightful and highly valued.",I have found this book to be a treasure that I'll enjoy for years to come. The photographs are windows into the artist's soul. I can gaze at a page for a very long time. I feel like I have my own photo-art gallery sitting on my table. I think it is a very personal undertaking and am very thankful that the author/artist decided to share this with us. I'm so glad that you had this available.
3,One subjective impression,"Annie's work is well known, and deeply respected for very good reason. The book is extremely well printed, with great detail and texture! To be completely honest, my family found some of the photos to be a bit graphic, and well... the book might have reached a wider audience if some other selections had been made for inclusion in the book."
3,Barker Street Regulars,"Barker Street was my first Ann Conant purchase and a disappointment. If you aren't a Sherlock Holmes fan, don't start your interest in Conant books here!"
4,Works great,"The only issue I have with it is that the plastic adapter you use for tightening feels chintzy. It works, but you feel like you're going to break it before you have it tight enough."
1,Aarghh...,Boom! This is one of the only enjoyable things about this game. The backround never seems to change and the gameplay never changes. Each room (there are 15 a stage) seems identical to the one before it. Unless you really enjoy slowmoving games- ignore this one.
2,good and bad,this game was great at first but turned bad! after doing the same exact thing for 1 maybe 2 hours it gets pretty boring.nothing seems to change threw the entire game.this game is only good if your planning on playing it from time to time.
2,Completely out-classed by Ninja Gaiden,"Average port of a PS2 game, this one was dead before it hit the shelf. Just like True Crime: Streets of LA came out at the same time as the vastly superior Grand Theft Auto made the jump to Xbox, Tenchu shows up practically the same day as Ninja Gaiden. NG has better controls, more addictive game-play, and graphics that make Tenchu look like a Playstation One game.Tenchu's been out less than a month and already they're discounting the price, but don't waste your money. It's like kissing your sister. Spend the extra money and get one of the best games ever seen on Xbox - and this isn't it.(No I don't work for Team Ninja!)"
5,The Race,The Race: Life's Greatest LessonWonderful little book. Makes a great gift. Very touching poem of life lessons.
4,Great Job,"Debbie Anderson does an incredible job with this book. The artwork is great, very vivid pictures and bright colors that capture the attention of any young child.The message of the book is great also. Anderson applies simple truths from the Bible that encourage the application of God's word to young hearts. Bible refrences on every page. Very well written in a way that engages children and teaches big truths.Drawbacks are that the book is a bit pricey for a childrens book, and it is not very long."
3,Lack of Picyures,"I did not really like this book because it did not have many pictures to demonstrate what was being explained.Other then that, it had a lot of good ideas about sorting clothes, making a list of cloths that work well with other clothes on the list."
1,Leatherman Juce Purple,"I have owned several Leaherman tools. ALL were superb, GREAT quality. However the Juce Purple is he worse piece of garbage I have seen outside of junk made in China! Leatherman has had to replace the can opener (for example) four times as it breaks, bends, etc. Yet most of their cheaper models work quite well and are sturdy. The Juce has design flaws, plain and simple. I wonder where it is made? China? Heck, China maks some good quality items. Maybe Pakistan... My favorite is the WAVE. I have really abused it and NOTHING breaks or bends."
3,review from I hate to iron,"I bought the steamer in hopes of ironing less. I am a nurse and my uniforms just need touch ups usually. I was very happy with my steamer at first. I had the steamer less than a year and the telescoping metal pole broke. I am still waiting for a replacement at $20. The poles are back-ordered so obviously lots of them break. I also noticed when I was done with the steamer and emptied the water there was some water residue left in the machine. I first got a washcloth to soak it up and the water was still very hot. I have yet to find a way to empty the old water in the machine. I think it is an o.k. steamer, certainly not a professional or commercial grade."
4,The Girl Who Heard Dragons,I enjoyed this story and the links to connect other parts in the story of Pern/
4,Wow... Vetti Is Twisted.,"Besides the recap episode which serves as mostly a waste it would seem, this volume did a fabulous job of resparking my interest in the story and characters. While audiences may not find themselves rushing out to purchase and view the next volume, there is more than enough here to create a healthy level of curiosity towards what Michel plans to do next and what Vetti has up his sleeve as well. If you've been on the fence about this series in the past, this may be the volume that tips you one way or the other."
4,"Wild Harvest - good, but incomplete","Have used this book for over 15 years. It's strengths are its detailed descriptions of ebible plants and the excellent color photos shown. Its weakness lies in its failure to mention and show numerous common edibles that appear in other similar texts. All in all, though, a good reference handbook"
2,More of pamphlet than a book,The book has nice pictures and good descriptions but it's so short (less than 90 pages including bibliography) that it leaves a lot of stuff out. It pays to shop around as some retailers on Amazon are selling it for much more than its listed price of $9.95.
3,Please note: this is a transfer from the vhs,It is not a digital remaster. It is also available much cheaper from the Warner Brothers online store.
4,Great for kids!!!,"My little sister got Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure as a birthday present. The game wasn't that great for me, but a blast for her. This game is almost exactly like the Tony Hawk series, except you skate as created kids or disney characters through bright colourful worlds. Tricks are very similar, multiplayer is exactly the same with Horse, Trick Challenge, and King of the Hill matches, and there is the same do missions for people to unlock levels and clothing as in Tony Hawk, also.Pros: Controls are very easy to learn, there is a good soundtrack,you can play as your favourite disney chacters in their worlds,takes a while to beat.Cons:The graphics could use some work, too easy for experienced gamers, corny, you can only create kids, strangely addictive, no xbox live.In conclusion, Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure is a very easy game, a bore for more experieced gamers, but a great game for kids and the family."
3,mixed feelings,"The dancing on this video is amazing, however, when the four dancers are talking, they never made it clear who it was that was talking. The two dancers who appeared younger could barely get in a few words. Althought their discussions were unclear the dancing is definately worth watching."
5,best ballerinas of all times,"i just would like to purchase this video due the ballerinas dancing in it , i saw on tv. years ago is unbelievable"
1,very disappointing,"When the plastic jar of my trusty Hamilton Beach blender cracked, I decided to buy a nicer blender, i.e., one with a glass jar, more powerful motor, etc. I went to the store and looked at the selection of Kitchen Aid, Cuisinart, Osterizer and Hamilton Beach models. After taking the jars apart and comparing features, I decided on this Kitchen Aid model. There is no doubt that the blender is composed of high-quality materials. The problem is that it doesn't do as good of a job as my old $30 Hamilton Beach blender. I could blend fruit smoothies with my Hamilton Beach, and NEVER find chunks of fruit in the bottom; with the Kitchen Aid, I find myself pouring the chunky concoction back into the jar for more work. For a blender this expensive, I shouldn't have to blend my smoothie for five minutes in order to ensure that I'm not chewing fruit chunks. Buy a Hamilton Beach and save your money."
1,Misleading... does not completely cover Professional 600 Mixer,"Purchased 6 quart mixer with this cover and it does not completely cover the mixer. I think it's a stupid design myself, the bottom of the cover stops 2 inches above the base of the mixer. It's like a medium shirt on an xtra large body. Looks stupid on your counter have the bottom of the mixer and bowl showing. The dimensions of the Pro 600 series mixer is 16.5 inches tall and the cover is 14.5 inches tall. However, it is well made and looks nice on the toaster. If you don't mind this cover not completely covering your Pro 600 mixer, buy it."
4,Quality Product,"The quality and color of this product are fine. It would be nice if it was a tad taller. Usually, we like to display the KitchenAid mixer anyhow."
3,Cover for 6 QT KitchenAid Mixer,"The cover is real thick and makes a good cover for the 6 QT KitchenAid Mixer. The only problem I see with the Cover is it is a little short as to the cover to the counter it sets on. I think it could be a little deeper to cover the bottom tray where the pan sets on all the way down to the counter. Product Info KitchenAid KMCC1KB Stand Mixer Cloth Cover, Khaki with Black Trim"
3,KMCC1WH Cloth Cover,"Nicely made, however it is too small for the KitchenAid 600 Series 6 Quart Stand Mixer that I bought. I imagine it fits nicely on the smaller one. Probably my fault because I did not remember the numbers for the series of Mixer that I bought. I kind of order this after the fact."
5,STand mixer cover,This cover was well worth the money. I have a blue stand mixer which doesn't match anything in my kitchen. Instead of purchasing a new mixer I went for the cover instead. It was a good choice. The color matches my cabinets and it looks very nice on the counter.
3,Does not fit 6-Quart Mixers,This item does not fit the 6-quart mixer. Would be fine for smaller mixers.
4,Cloth cover for Kitchaid mixer,Even though is is a well made and attractive product it does not fit the new 600 kitchenaid model very well. The bowl part with handle extends therefore I struggle to get the cover over it and even then it will not go all the way down to fully cover the machine.
3,Does what it's suppose to,well sewn and exactly what you expect when you open the packaging. I wish it had a place to put the wish attachment when not in use (maybe a pocket on one of the ends? If you put it in the pockets that exist it puffs out a whole lot. Would also have been nice for it to have a hook on the top so I can hang it up on a kitchen hook when I am using the mixer instead of it sitting in a pile. I couldn't find a cover that had the exact features I wanted so I settled for this one and it will be just fine. Made of nice heavy material.
5,Love This Cover - Should Have Purchased It a Long Time Ago!!,"I was excited to receive this cover for my KitchenAid Stand Mixer. It is well made and very cushiony and sits right down completely over the mixer, thus protecting it from dust and all other kitchen hazards!! (smile). It took some time before I did purchase the cover ... wasn't sure if it was good quality ... boy, I was pleasantly surprised. Hope it stands up just the same once it's been laundered. Now that will truly be the 'real test'. If it's not a good outcome, I'll certainly be back with a new review of the item. However, for the moment, I'm quite impressed with this cover and wish that I had made the purchase sooner.Would recommend for everyone who owns a KitchenAid Stand Mixer to get on board and make the purchase ... you won't regret it!!"
4,KitchenAid Mixer Cover,"The mixer cover is great! I especially love the pocket as it is large enough to keep the information on the mixer and any receipies that I am working on. While the material is durable, I would have preferred a smoother cloth."
5,Excellent!!,"This fit my KitchenAid stand up mixer. I have the smallest size, I think it's the 4.5 quart one. It does have extra room so I believe it would also fit the bigger stand up mixers."
5,bio,great book has exactly asame info as the latest edition. book was in great condition.the book came super fast and i was able to have it for class when i needed it.
5,Viewitful Game,"An excellent cel shaded game, with controls to match. The game never gets tiring and is easy to pick up, but hard to put down. Definately a requirment in the library of Gamecube owners."
