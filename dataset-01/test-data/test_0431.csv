1,This is nuts!,"Even the Bush administration, as horrible as it is, could not recruit enough secretive insiders (all of whom have kept their mouths shut or been murdered) to engineer and carry out the kind of self-inflicted 9/11 terrorist attack Mr. Griffin claims. A conspiracy of this magnitude - carried out by Americans against 3000+ other Americans - is just not credible. Mr. Griffin may be a superstar in philosophy, but he goes way, way over the deep end in this book. Thw New Pearl Harbor badly fails the smell test. Save your money for other books like The Assassins Gate and The Next Attack."
5,911 truth,"For factual information about Sept. 11 that you will never find in the corporate owned mainstream media, this is a great start."
5,Surprisingly good,"Bought this and was somewhat skeptical about the quality of sound because I bought some other IPOD speakers that sounded awful. This is really a good system, surprisingly loud with good fidelity. Batteries last a long time. It stands up by itself and is very portable. I downloaded a lot of Podcasts and was not able to get the time to listen to them on my Mac. I downloaded them and played them on these speakers, so now I am caught up. It does not charge the IPod, however, and does not have an AC jack."
5,awesome product,"This product is lightweight and a great value for its price. I was hesitant to spend a lot of money on a stereo for my ipod nano because I was not going to use it that often, but it really is an awesome product. It is small, so I was unsure whether or not the sound volume was going to be enough, but it definitely is! I love this product, and how compact it is! It runs on 3 AA batteries, but is included with the purchase! Highly recommended!"
1,Senseless Propaganda,This is a sad attempt at fame by shock value. This author was clearly an uneducated bigot trying to get famous from a bold title and fallacious arguments. This book overlooks obvious facts. Also note the author just so happened to marry a Turkish woman.Better off reading something enlightening like Dr. Seuss instead.
4,Someone who made an effort to get more details.,"When I got this book I was open minded in waiting to hear the possibilities that may be expressed. I read the late Samuel Weens research and how he went abroad to get the details. Rest his soul he did his best to tell it like he saw it. I was sorry to hear that he did not get access to some documentation from Armenian sources due to denial of his request. Read this book if your looking for detailed information simply written. I know most Armenians will find it hard to take, but finding the truth is not always easy."
5,At last there are some people caring for the Truth,A well written book with ample references and based mostly on Armenian sources disproving their reliability.Excellent scientific approach of a former judge of Arkansas who passed away one year ago.
4,Love this but,"There's no way Will would let Nell go out to the barn by herself. And I wish that the author were more adept in weaving in the first story to the first or that she would assume we've read the first. All the ""backfill"" is a little irritating. That being said, I'm addicted and am currently reading No. 3. I am glad they've been listed in order."
2,Nell Sweeney can be improved,The writing on these books could be improved. Grammar and typos are rampant. This is only the 2nd one which is an improvement over the 1st one; so perhaps the 3rd would be better than the 2nd. One can only hope. Story line is not that bad.
3,not bad,Not as good as the first of the series. Too much time spent on innermost feelings - action suffers. A good plot.Miss Sweeney's liberty to move around considering the time and place.
5,The guy who taught Amon Tobin how to make drum & bass tunes,"Released in 1996 by a label making a kamekaze dive into oblivion, Telharmonium presented itself to an uncaring public without any real promotion and no proper distribution. Consequently it sank without trace.Resonator was the first artist released on Ninebar and as such suffered from the labels lack of experience and over abundant enthusiasm. Packed with unusual samples, lavish strings, dub bass and proglike guitars this sits somewhere between Red Snapper and DJ Shadow and is as good as either. Whilst the album has been long deleted, tracks from it can be downloaded free of charge on Resonator's myspace page. www.myspace.com/resonatorukAnd yes, he did teach Amon Tobin drum & bass. The track Cruzer on Cujo's Adventures in Foam, was drum programmed by Resonator who also engineered most of the album."
2,Not Commercial,"I ordered these for my wife thinking I was getting commercial grade products. The thing that stands out the most in the accompaning booklet was the phrase""not for commercial use"". The non-stick capabilities are great but these are thin cookie sheets that sell for a couple of dollars... We have real commercial heavy cookware and this does not compare at all. We were very disappointed."
2,burnt cookies,"The nonstick finish is fantastic, but I burn cookies each time. I had tried several recipes, turning down the temperature in the oven and baking for 2/3 the time. Still they burn. I am quite disappointed as they were not cheap. I dragged out my mother's very old cooking sheets out of the garage and will start using them again so we can have cookies that bake correctly."
4,Good fun and a close view of history.,"This book reads quickly and easily. It gives a view of some of the dramatic events of of the war of 1812, seen through the eyes of Dolly Madison. The reader feels present in history, partaking of life in Washington D.C. in the early days of the war, through the confusion and terror of the burning of Washington. The characters are fun and varied, with historical figures fleshed out as ""real people"" and making decision important in American history. I felt like I was there with them."
2,How not to conduct a manned mission....,"This is suppose to be fiction based on science fact. The CGI and visuals are stunning and mostly realistic. This is about a manned mission to tour the planets on board the Pegasus. The story has them first going to Venus and conducting a manned landing there and running into problems. Going to Mars, to Jupiter and it's moons, Saturn and finally to a comet. With each visit, there was a near fatal, and foreseeable catastrophe. This is a clever campaign against manned missions and leans more favorable to robot missions. The robots that were sent had no problems. I had issues with the astronauts in that they didn't do what they were told and making a solo landing on Io alone was totally unthinkable. I love the visuals but the story was invalid from the get go."
3,good but not great,"Given Fred Rogers' gift for phrasing difficult lessons in ways accessible to children, I had high hopes for this book. It's good, but it's not great. Maybe I'm just being picky, but I think ""BM"" doesn't roll off the tongue well, and ""defecate"" would have been better to pair with ""urinate"". It's certainly not treacly or cutesy, so that's a big plus. Overall, I say buy, but not with the unequivocal enthusiasm I'd anticipated."
1,"MR. ROGERS, HOW COULD YOU?","Not nearly up to the level we'd expect from Mr. Rogers. The pictures are dated and unattractive and the text is boring and uninformative. Don't be fooled by the September 1997 date--this book is a reprint of a slim volume originally published years ago, and seems old-fashioned to today's children. It looks like a cheap imitation of Alison Mack's delightful and effective TOILET LEARNING: THE PICTURE BOOK TECHNIQUE FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS, using tacky photos instead of Mack's cute drawings, and leaving out the all-important section that gives guidance to parents. Mr. Rogers' book is just the thing for parents who want to save a few dollars at their children's expense."
5,To the point and well written.,Some have reviewed Going to the Potty by Fred Rogers as outdated.Yes---the pictures were taken years ago but who cares. The pictures are discrete yet very informative and neither I nor my child cares what clothes the people are wearing. The information is still up to date---going to the potty hasn't changed over the years has it? I highly recommend this book. It does not contain any silly characters or make potty training into a story but a reality of real people using the potty. Good job Mr. Rogers!
4,Excellent story with hidden twists,"I loved this movie! The real-ness of the storyline and the passion that Billy had for his art and his subject (Gabriel) made this movie even more realistic. I will say the ending was not what I wanted, and it left me with several questions, but all in all -- I really enjoyed the movie and would see it again."
3,All The Songs Need to be full length,"Good DVD Loved the Preformances. Ecept there is one probem only about 75% of them are in full-length form. So for this reason this tape gets 3 starrs. I've seen many people consider this video a documintary, well I think this DVD is more about the music I mean don't get me wrong there is a great deal of documintary information on the Band, it's just that well on this DVD there seems to be more muscic rather than documintation. I Also like how the director of this film videoized some of the live preformances.By Ted Kissel"
4,Interesting DVD,"The quality of this video is not great. It is obviously clips of home video put together, but the content is irreplacable."
3,entertaining but the cd's are confusing,"This would have been a 5 star had the books been each on an individual cd instead of starting wherever the last story ended. My children still love the stories, it just makes it a little difficult for the one operating the cd's."
3,Magic Tree House Collection: Books 1-8,"My boys love listening to Magic Tree House cd's as they go to sleep and had two cd's from Wendy's kids meals. I purchased these and they are happy that they have them. I however, wish that each book was on it's own cd. The eight books are on 5 cd's. So one book stops and the new one begins. The books and the cd's series are awesome, They have adventure and also education stories.Thank you,"
1,Name tracks is not ok,"Dear:This isn't possible. I believe after years disappointments with customers (view 1 star) I think thats problem solved..BUT NO. I received new products and the track names are not equal to the contents of the readings. Only two of the 10 CDs are right!. I bought 9-16 audiobooks too. Please, I want to return the CDs, but obviously these are already open.Thanks"
1,Magic Tree House,The CD is scratched and stops mid through some chapters!! I purchased this as NEW not used and am really disappointed. I bought this for my son and he is dissapointed.
4,Pups and Kids,"We have a new puppy, so this was intended to help our granddaughter learn how to treat a pup."
1,One Blatant Illustration Ruins This Book,"This otherwise nice story on the ever-popular theme of a family finding a pet is marred by one blatant, jarring element of the illustrations. Throughout most of the action in the book, the father is wearing a t-shirt that clearly shows a large, lit cigarette, which could be tobacco or marijuana, I'm not sure. The illustration is vivid and visible on several pages. WHY? I am all for depicting realistic people and settings, but when there are so many excellent children's books, why choose this irresponsibly illustrated book?"
3,A few good tracks.,"This is for the most part, no too great. There is 2 outstanding tracks [misty & autumn leaves], but the rest are just to ""60's"" for me. I bought this album expecting a killer jazz record, but in all reality it is a lot like Montgomery's ""A day in the life"" album. A great jazz player, playing 60's pop, or jazz songs in the style of 60's pop. If you are looking for a Roberts album, I'd go with Dirty & Funky. Satin Doll on there is out of this world."
1,"No battery life, volume needs to be higher.","Although there is no interference at all, I would not buy this product again. It is not worth the price as the battery life is about 2 hours and it needs to stay on the stand charging to use it at all. The volume on this is way too low and there isn't anything you can do about it."
2,"Good product, be aware of radiation.","This product works great, but that comes at a price of potential health risks. The level of EMF/EMR radiation coming from this phone on DECT sinal levels is substantial.Potential health effects can occur. I wouldn't recommend it for this reason alone. This is like putting a high powered mobile phone mast next to your babies body."
5,Pricey...but worth it!!,"I really like this moniter. I hesitated to spend the money; but after many sleepless nights due to the static interference of my previous moniter;...I splurged. This moniter is quiet and doesn't pick up all the background noise that other moniter's do. I previously had a Fisher Price. My other son has a room right next to the baby and with the other moniter I could hear his TV, etc. Now I only hear the baby. I like the feature that I can talk to the baby from my handset. When I hear him I can assure him I'm on my way."
2,charger fails and display fails,"Not too happy for the price versus performance. We have had this monitor for 17 months and of course everything began to fail after warranties expire. It works great until then. My guess is very poor manufacturing processes of the electronics. That is why you see so many good reports and a smaller amount of these bad ones. Basically you take a risk of falling into the 30% of folks getting defective units with failures occurring after a years time. All said it would be a great unit if the charger would still charge the unit and the LCD display didn't have multiple segments gone, a real guessing game to what the temperature is : )"
2,Work on the cradle please!,"I am just one of those lucky ones like other users, the cradle just own charge up... when we got the monitor.. it has 1 bar of the battery.. but after 16 hrs of charging..(which was instructed) it went from 1 bar to 0 bar.. man.. Philips.. please do soemthing about it. The recepiton is crystal clear but hey.. if the charging cradle doesn't work.. everything else won't mean anything any more! Good luck to others new born parents."
5,Amazing!,"My elderly mom has home health care workers who stay with her every night. They went through 2 years of having to listen to all kinds of static and I felt terrible for them. Although the price on this is high, it is WELL WORTH the cost to assure a good night's sleep. When my mom calls them her voice is crystal clear. My mother is paranoid (dementia) that the monitor will quit working and they won't hear her so i am, today, buying a SECOND one so there can be two hooked up in the same room to assure her."
4,Perfect for Halloween!,We enjoyed broadcasting the tunes thru our mp3 player on Halloween night. THe trick or treaters and their parents really enjoyed the music
2,Misssing Master,"If ""Imitation is the deepest form of flattery"" this film should be praised to the heavens. The viewer can almost see the meetings that took place prior to its creation...""What would 'he' have done?...How would 'he' have filmed this?...."" The ""he"", of course, is the master Krzysztof Kieslowski. In the end imitation remains imitation. The acting is O.K., but one feels the actors are indeed ""acting"", which is very troubling. The ""nurse"" (?) who offers the very expensive magic bullet for Stuhr's mother was particularly bad. Not a film I could recommend."
3,Not so stealthy,"When I bought a new graphics card and added some RAM, I also asked the salesperson (bought this at a reasonably high end custom PC parts store) for the quietest fan they had since I was hoping to have the PC running in the same room as I watch TV, play games, listen to music, etc. Unfortunately, when I got the system home and fired it up, there was a distinct hum. I was very disappointed, since I was hoping for a near silent PC. I'm now looking up reviews online for better fans. Basically threw away about $60 with 3 fans."
4,"The late, great Ray Kane - slack key ambassador to the world","Of the half dozen or more great slack key guitar (kiho'alu) players who ""talk story"" in this documentary, the late Ray Kane is featured. This is not an instructive, how-to-play slack key video. Rather, it tells the story of the role slack key guitar has played in resurrecting the Hawaiian culture and its many beautiful songs (meles) and hula dances. As you listen to the nahe nahe (sweet & easy) sounds, the Aloha will well-up inside you, revealing more about Hawaii than you'll ever discover during a week in a resort hotel. Mahalo, Susan Friedman for putting this together. Aloha."
3,Rigid steel rods?,"The product description claims, ""Deluxe model contains a rigid steel rod at top and bottom and rings for easy mounting."" What you actually get are pliable plastic 'rods'. The product description blatently misrepresents the product. Shameful!"
4,Excellant customer service,"When I first received the map, I was disappointed to see that it somehow had been shipped without its mounts. I emailed the company and received a reply almost immediately. Not only was my concern addressed, but I received a new map with an upgraded mount priority mail just in time to give as planned. The map itself is a great size, with countries and locations distinct and easy to read. They took a situation that began poorly and made it great!"
3,Nice watch but doesn't work.,Nice watch but when I received it it wasn't working. May be the battery - shouldn't be shipped out with dead batteries. This was a gift in which I gave to the recipient and then had to take back because it wasn't working.
4,east storage for 4x6s,These books are a clever way to store 4x6 photos. The 3 books hold lots of pictures and the set takes up little space. Looks nice on the shelf with other book sets like them for our archive.
5,xvision's for life!,"this is my favorite pair of sunglasses and you can't beat the price. i had a problem from thrashing a pair and the company really took care of me and fixed my shades no questions asked. unbelievable in this day and age of ripoffs, rebates and hassles."
4,Exactly what she was looking for,"My daugter wanted a loofah with a handle to use in the shower at college. This is exactly what she was looking for. It was well made, but it was shipped kind of funny, it didn't really fit in the box it was sent in but it was not damaged in any way."
4,Short and Sweet,This is an excellent book for those who want a snappy and accurate summary review of the book's reception and the associated films'impact.Enables a synoptic overview and a gives an indication of the cultural climate at the time of the book's writing and the films being first distributed.
2,If your a real fan - you have compiled it already,"This little ""book"" is not worth the money payed for it. If you are a big fan of crusade, you probably have compiled this list by yourself. If you are not a fan, you better wait for a real guidebook like those published about Babylon 5."
1,Faulty 12 GB Store n Go Product,"Update and Edit 5/24/07: Although there was a problem with the Store n Go that I purchased from Amazon, Verbatim Technical Support promptly replaced the faulty drive and the new one seems to work well. I would (if I could) raise my rating to 3 stars.Watch Out! There is a fundamental flaw in the 12GB Store n Gos that are now being shipped. (See previous review) I received mine on 5/11/07. I was excited to try this 12GB flash drive, but it doesn't work and freezes my computers. I know how to use USB drives and flash drives--I have several. Moreover, I have Ceedo installed on some of my drives. They all work. The 12GB Verbatim Store n Go does not work.After recognizing ""New Hardware,"" I get a message to the effect that the USB device has a problem and will not work correctly.Too bad. It looked as if it could have been a good product."
1,Arnold Should Take His Name off this Product,"I ordered Black, I got Green, I ordered a Medium and the shirt says Medium but it is not. It is a Large, hard to tell.Very poor quality, fit & design. I gave it one star only because there is nothing lower."
3,Confused by the high ratings?!,"Well, even though I'd not heard of Bethenny prior to this workout, the reviews seemed to convince me to purchase the workout. I wasn't impressed with this workout. The arm section was probably the most intense for me, it was 10 minutes. The 40 minute yoga workout was fairly easy. It could of been relaxing except Bethenny made comments throughout which were unnecessary & annoying. During the yoga workout, Bethenny's form was unimpressive. Again, I didn't now anything about her before this, so maybe those that enjoy this workout also appreciate Bethenny's personality.Kristin McGee, the instructor, was pleasant. She did a nice job explaining form throughout the workout. I would recommend this workout for beginner to intermediate exercisers. If you know and like Bethenny, are at a beginner/intermediate fitness level then it's for you =) Otherwise, I'd skip this one."
4,Good Yoga Workout With Bonus Strength Training,"This is a nice introduction to Yoga. Bethenny emphasizes that this is the type of exercise that she really does and is calmly encouraging. She works with Kristin McGee, who is a solid, non intimidating instructor. I like the banter between the two and the emphasis on modifying if necessary. There is about 40 minutes of yoga, a 10 minute strength training section focused on the arms, and a 5 minute bonus ""booty blast."" With the weights, Bethenny again emphasizes that this is what she really does and it is a good workout without being too crazy. I've used the weight section separately--it's a nice add on to a cardio workout if you also want to do a little toning. Overall, I like this DVD. Bethenny and Krisin present a workout that is good exercise, but that doesn't feel impossible to get through."
3,User Review,I like the yoga instructor. Bethenny talks too much during the yoga portion. I enjoy the arm exercises - I do them even without the video.
3,Fine--if you like Bethenny!,"I'll agree with what some other reviewers said: the yoga portion is not for someone who's never done yoga before, but if you're much more than a beginner you'll get bored fast. You are expected to have a lot of basic knowledge about the poses because explanation isn't given (and when the teacher is explaining, Bethenny is typically interrupting her with a goofy remark, which are funny if you like her but I was even getting annoyed! Like shut up, Bethenny, and let's get on with the workout!). The other thing that's different with this video is that they don't go into any of the spiritual aspects of a yoga practice. It's done much more as a type of workout for fitness rather than mental benefits. For me personally, that's missing half of the point of yoga but if you're turned off by that part, you might like it.Complaints aside, it's a decent workout. It's quick & efficient, and hard enough for the basics, but not super challenging."
4,I love this video!,"It's the perfect combination of yoga, weights, and squats - one hour gets in a full body workout, I love it!"
4,Enjoyable,"I really enjoy this DVD. It is a very easy to follow yoga dvd, with a 5 minute ""Booty Blast"" and a 10 minute strength training segment. You certainly will sweat during this workout and you will be sore the next day. My only complaint is that is might be too easy, and a after a few times doing it is becomes a little boring. I still love it for those days when I don't feel like challenging myself to much, plus I love Bethenny and the humor she adds to the workout."
2,Great Baking pan But...............,"I have to agree with the other review about those corners. I just made a cake and am having fits trying to clean the corners. I thought a q-tip might help and it did a little bit but its too big for the corner. I will soak it a little longer and think of something else. If I could unfold the thing there wouldnt be a problem. As it is, I am going to look into the Hoffritz brand instead."
4,"Infectious, Need to read more about the Time Warp Trio","This is the second of Time Warp Trio adventures which my daughter (8 years old) and I have read. Again, we laughed and were intrigued to follow the adventure. Again, the illustrations were humorous and imaginative! Best of all the end of the story was a creative twist which had us look at each other and question what was said and what did it mean."
2,Hissing Head Squisher,"These headphones are uncomfortable to me, they are sprung too tightly, with no adjustment. The noise cancelling does appear to work, but I wanted to use them to attenuate the noise from adjoining cubicle dwellers. It does this effectively if you turn up the volume, but so do regular ear-bud headphones. The hiss with the noise cancelling turned on is not something that you could stand without some high volume music to go along with it. I haven't taken a plane ride with them, so I'm not sure how they would fare in that application. Also, it uses 1 AA battery, not 2 AAA."
2,Nice idea with mediocre execution,"I bought these headphones after briefly trying a friend's pair. The price was low, but so is the comfort level. They sit a little too tight on my ears, so I don't keep them on for more than 30-60 minutes at a time. Also, the fabric covering the speakers wears out and rips off over time. My friend's pair eventually snapped in half (though he is a heavy headphone user).Also, the headphones block out low frequency noises pretty well (especially on an airplane), but I can still perfectly understand what people are saying. Part of my intention with these headphones was to block out people-noise so I can better concentrate at work."
4,good but not excellent,this book is very good. it has many things that are accuarte and things that arent. the charts are kind of hard to understand but it was totally worth what i paid for it.
3,Purchase after watching the original series,"Through some miracle all of the original voice actors are reassembled for a reboot of the Berserk anime. While the overall execution and polish of this is much better than the original series, the character development and sense of atmosphere are not there in this. The original music composer is back but that violent, tragic, and beautiful feeling is just not there. A must have for die hard Berserk fans but I would strongly recommend watching the original series first."
2,NOT DURABLE AT ALL,The roller for the track broke with in a few days the felt came off of it. We can't get the pen to even open. The tracks have to be perfect for Thomas to follow.
4,toot toot,"Aquadoodles are a big hit around my house and this one is the favorite.My 4 year old son adores all things Thomas and he's had a great deal of fun drawing and having Thomas following all his doodles.He liked it so much I even bought him the Sir Topham Hat that goes with it.Cute toy,enjoy!"
2,Mission bench,"Well, to tell you the truth, I've received the bench twice and had to send it back twice, because it was damaged both times. I am now awaiting the third try. I actually bought this as a christmas gift for my sister and she has yet to see it put together, I think that's really sad."
2,Nonstick?,I bought this pan only to use for angel food cakes because it said non stick. Well it sticks and because the bottom doesn't come out like a traditional pan it makes it very hard to get the cake out. I have to line it with parchment paper. It is heavy duty and bakes well but I wouldn't call it nonstick.
5,"fast, easy and cheap","Fine, so this is not the best stuff on earth. I do think it is good enough in a practical sense.The pan does not heat up as fast as some of the top-of-the-line calphalon or all-clad stuff. However, it is pretty good compares to other similar productsIf one uses the proper utensil and cleaning method, the non-stick surface shouldn't be a problem. Clean up is pretty easy.It may not be as heavy or bullets proof as some other pans, but I tend to think of it as an advantage. Personally, I don't feel like grabbing a 10 LB weight-lifting piece of steel every time I want to cook an egg. I hate wrestling with a heavy pan in the kitchen sink just to get it clean.The heat up is fast, the clean up is easy, it's easy to handle, and the price is cheap. For your day-to-day cooking task, this pan is plenty."
2,Look elsewhere for a better value,"Having owned a set of Pots & Pans for 5 years I can say confidently that your money would be better spent on the Anolon Pro 8"" frying pan, which has superior non-stick, is heavier gauge and generally costs the same. The primary difference is that the Calphalon has a rounded interior while the Anolon has straight edges (if that's a concern, I'd recommend looking at Cuisinart or even higher-quality Calphalon). Cleanup of this pan is anything but easy and the non-stick started wearing off almost immediately. And as for the dimples on the bottom of the pan... they make for an interesting pattern on your food but I see no other value to them (other than to trap food)."
1,Don't order this product!,"The color cartridge was so light that it was very visible. The black ink printed out about 25 pages. It printed on additional pages, but you could only read 3-5 words on each pages. So a lot of paper was wasted, I could not use. I will NEVER order this product again. I don't have money to throw away and with this product I feel that I threw it away. I sacrifice to pay for the ink that I desperately needed; to print off documents for my husband's veterans information. The only things I got for my money was anger and maybe 2 documents which left me without the other required documentations. Not happy! Not happy at all."
5,Always a reliable ink,Have used this ink for many years and plan to use it for many more. Have made excellent photo prints with these 2 colors.
1,The product is NOT the same as before.,"I've used this product for several years and really believed in it. I just received my order today, and IMMEDIATELY knew something was wrong. The consistency was thinner, and the flavor was way off. I checked the label, and it no longer states 70% Elderberry juice when reconstituted. Now it has the long list of ingredients, with Elderberry as the FOURTH. Additionally, the recommended serving size is now TWO tablespoons rather than one. Talk about Bait and Switch!! I'll use up this order and then I'm DONE with Natural Sources unless they switch back to the pure concentrate that I've been using the last few years. WARNING to anyone reading the other reviews, the product is not as advertised, and is now an unknown, watered-down product."
5,This album is a treasure.,"As a classical music fan for over 50 years, I know a great collection of music when I hear it. This album is one of the best I have EVER heard. Whether you are new to classical music or an old fart like me, I strongly encourage you to listen to this collection. Unlike the above review, I do not find it at all sleep-inducing, but rather so beautiful that one can only sit there in the darkness (the best way to listen to music) and be transfixed by its loveliness. The French are wonderful composers (although I didn't know that Ottorino Respighi was French!). Buy this album!"
3,Ehh.,"unless you love stragiety (spelling?) i'd pass. old world graphics, etc.. i really never completed game because this genre(spelling!) is not my forte (accente gue?)."
4,Enertaining RTS,"Played the demo, game looks to have good potential. Like the idea of not mining but capturing territory with resources to increase your funds. The mouse controls were a little sluggish in the demo hope this will be ironed out on the complete version. The graphics were excellent and the terrain does make a difference when attacking and defending. If you like to tank rush then your in trouble this is not C & C. You will have to use your surroundings to good effect. This one is on my must have list."
2,Soaper Fruit Cocktail - for the birds?,"I purchased this for my two parrots. After noticing they were not eating all of the treat - I tried some of the dried fruits and nuts. Everything I tried had a strong taste of soap. I understand now why the birds were not overly excited about their new treats. In checking the ingredients (looking for palmolive...) I notice BHA preservative, a known carcinogen. I do not recommend this product."
2,Pretty boring,"I am a patient reader and don't need a lot to keep my attention. Unfortunately, this book just didn't cut it. I would disagree with those who said the characters were well developed. Although each character had a memorable quirk, the author seemed to focus on quantity vs. quality... I kept waiting for the book to get better and it never did! With so many books out there, I'd recommend taking a rain check on this one."
5,this CD changed my LIFE!!!,"this was the first ever residents album i ever heard. i had a dream about clowns and circus music being played at clubs. and my friend told me about these dudes and said...""hey, you like freak show music, check out the residents"" so i did, and they were the band of my dreams! although they dont play circus music and dress like clowns, they are very close though. i was 15 years old when i first heard these fools. im 20 now, and this stuff got me totally into obscure avant garde junk. so if you like Harry Partch, just imagine harry partch playing music in 2003, but instead these guys were doing it in 1972. hmm, i wonder if you get the idea. this album is the best album i have ever bought and it continued to be till this day."
3,Y'all betta recognize...,"MC White in da houze! I am the king of mixing, and the rap master of disaster. Check out my customer image (will get uploaded later tonight) so check back, and get ready to mix with the master!MC White said: IN DA HOUZE!!!!!"
2,It's the Quran,"Reading the Quran is quite a shocker sometimes. Especially if you come to it with basic assumptions of peace and the equality of mankind. There are, non the less, some great stories and lessons in the Quran, I will not deny it, although most of them are also in the Torah and the Bible first (which are themselves shockers to first time readers sometimes! though, I'd say less so) And as the Muslims claim, there are some amazing things in there that are seemingly 'before their time' though the educated person knows that much of the sciences and maths like Algebra an Chemistry have their origins with the Arabs who were quite scientific in older days around the time of the compiling of the Quran from its various sources. I do encourage curious people to read it, for we should not be totally ingnorant. Though just alittle bit more reading and you'll find it (the Quran) is not so Holy as the Muslims would have you believe."
4,A Fair and Good Interperatation,"I deem that this translation is indeed a good interpretation of the Qur'an, which does not contradict the original arabic Qur'an, be it in wordings or literary devices. As all translations, there are minor mistakes which do not shake the integrity of the original arabic text, most of them are in choice of words. A practical interpretation. The author seems to employ all primary meanings of several terminologies."
5,Great,"TV shows dont get any better than this.I now have 1,2,3,4 series and the standard is the same all the way through, Fantastic entertainment.The actors are all first class, the stories are all interesting, the overall look of each episode is outstanding.Anyone that likes this type of show would not be dissapointed."
5,Incredible results - the best griddle ever!,"This griddle is truly amazing. You can cook 12 small or 6 large pancakes at a time, or scramble 18 eggs. The deep edges keep everything where it should be, and the little gully around the side contains any butter while you're cooking your pancakes. We have a solid surface cooktop, and it works just fine, but I think it would do much better on a gas stove. The bottom is somewhat concave, which means it doesn't have continuous contact with the surface and takes a bit longer to heat up. But once it gets going, watch out! Cleans up like a dream. I could even see cooking burgers or fried ham on it."
4,slightly disappointed,"Yes it works great, and you can fit lots of food on it. BUT - it didn't work so great on my ceramic cooktop, because of the way mine is configured. I could only fit the griddle on the biggest heating element and the smallest. Still, although it took a long time to heat up before I could pour the batter, it did a good job with the only fault being that it never did heat up the outer edges of the griddle where the small element didn't reach. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
2,Lost in translation,"I always loved and remembered Bill's infrequent TV appearances. He had that anti-establishment Carlin vibe, but this film spends too much time on the negative and destructive elements of his life. The abbreviated comedy bits included in this film are a poor representation of his humor especially when the film touts him as a legend. Bill was a true talent, this film just doesn't do him justice. Not including his edited Letterman appearance in its entirety was a major omission on the filmmaker's part. Very Disappointing!!!"
5,There were 5 Seasons,"For all of you that are wondering, there were 5 seasons of Soul Food on Showtime. The DVD'S were released with Season 4 being combined with Season 3 and the Final Season. I hope this helps!!!"
5,A season forgotten!!,I love soul food!!! I think that season four's release was skipped. Please release season four. It just wouldn't be the same with out the whole set.
5,Perfect fit,Great quality. Easy to install. This is a brand you can trust with their craftsmanship and not have to worry about junk arriving at your doorstep
3,worth the money,"I received this as a gift for my 2 year old daughter for her birthday. I hesitated from the reviews on giving it to her. As a mom of three small kids this is a great toy becasue she can play it alone, she can use both sides and its no mess. Anything that has no lights, music and involves creative thinking, imaginiation and quiet play is a blessing. The pen does run out of water and could have been bigger but the toy holds up well. I think worth the money."
1,Horrible product!,"This is an absolutely HORRIBLE toy. I bought it for my 2 girls for Christmas and they both HATED it. The first time the toddler got on it, she fell off immediately and got hurt. She tried again later while I guarded her, and again, off she went. My older daughter (3) couldn't make it bounce, roll or do anything exciting and got off it immediately never to get back on. As well as boring, I think it is incredibly unsafe ... the ""handle"" is not really a handle and therefore there is nothing substantial to hold onto. Don't be lured in by sweet childhood memories of yesteryear. They took a good product and totally DESTROYED it. Buyer beware ... don't put your child's safety in jeoperdy!"
1,Not Great!,"This little worm didn't work well for my special needs son. He freaked out when I put him on it. The saddle-style seat with built in hand grip is ackward to say the least. It is so low and the plastic is not smooth, so my child didn't want to hold on. He basically threw himself backwards when I put him on this. I am glad I was holding onto him the entire time. I sold it on craigslist. It just didn't seem safe. Also, my child's feet barely touched the ground with this and he is 32"" tall. No good! There isn't even a way to make it bounce. You have to have 100lbs pushing down on it to get it to move!"
4,Ok toy,"I never saw the original version of this toy, but I picked this one up cheap on Amazon. My 2 yr old likes it ok. It does not steer or have handles so it seems harder to ride. She just pushes it around with her feet so far. She has not figured out the bouncing part yet. For the price I paid I think it will be fine. I will still get her anothr one that she can ""drive"" with turning wheels & something to hold onto."
5,Terrific,"They are larger than I expected with a lovely vanilla scented candle supplied that fills the entire vessel, versus one that you just pop in. I'm delighted with them! However, it may be challenging to find appropriately sized replacement candles when the originals are finished."
4,A Cautionary Tale......,"A good movie for young people to see because of the vast differences in the penal systems (US vs. Thailand). Once you are in a jail in a primitive country, you have no rights and the fact that you are a US citizen is not respected, nor do you receive any special treatment. Conditions were appalling and I don't know how people survive in such a facility.I thought the ending was heartwrenching and I wondered if this movie was based on a true story?"
1,Corny,Am I wrong or this movie is an insult to the king/gov of Thailand ? What's wrong with you people ? In any case it's really corny ! :D
1,apparently not for everyone,"I got this for free, and was excited because of all the five star reviews, but realized halfway through that the characters were causing me real anxiety through their stupid behavior. The female lead is basically an all-forgiving doormat and the male lead is...such a jackass! I have read a million romance novels where the characters spend a bunch of time denying their true feelings, but Noah did and said so many unlikeable things that I really hoped Elle would find someone else to appreciate her. Also, once she gives up on him and goes forward with her life by enrolling in a university, Noah STALKS her. Basically he is either being a jerk, or being a creep. I did not enjoy this story at all."
3,Pat's Book Review,"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.Since this book was the second in the Seaswept series, I purchased and read the first book (Tides of Love) before reading this one. I consider myself a very mature reader. I've always been an avid reader. I found both of these books to be very adolescent. I read these types of books when I was in my early teens.Even though this novel satisfies all areas of a supposedly great book: comedy, suspense, and romance, I found there was little to no actual story, or the story was just too simple.I did like the way the characters from Book 1 and Book 2 related and interacted to each other. The heroine, Savannah in Book 2 is a reformer for women's rights. The hero, Zack is the town constable and a widower with a small boy. The chemistry between the two is quite powerful from the first moment they meet. Neither wants a serious relationship, but they both want the same thing, and that's the rest of the story!"
2,Poor quality,"This watch is of poor quality. The band is full of sharp edges, and couple of the links were stuck together on mine. (they would not flex) The bezel is susposed to turn, but it might require a channel lock pliers to do it. Over all, this watch has the quality and feel of a $30.00-$40.00 time piece."
2,dr.,"Although the book features the similar content to the large hardcover books, this book is difficult to read and poorly bound, falling apart within several days."
3,Christmas fun,The Four seasons do a good job with anything they sing and their Christmas album is the Four Seasons. If you are a fan you will like it.
3,Christmas with The Four Seasons,"If you like Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, and you like Christmas music, you will like this album. There are three medleys that are interesting and they do a good job on Carol of the Bells. I enjoyed it, but it won't take the place of other albums I like better. It will give you a different listening experience on some familiar songs."
2,my least favorite of Lester's books,"While I am generally a huge fan of HL/LM books, this one I found a little too abrasive/foul for a young audience (my kids are 5 and 2). I would not recommend this one for young kids, but would steer you instead to other HL/LM books that we absolutely loved (and I would rate 5 stars):TACKY THE PENGUIN (Good stuff)LISTEN BUDDY (Great)A PORCUPINE NAMED FLUFFY (Funny)SCORE ONE FOR THE SLOTHS (Fun)"
3,"Nice to have, but...","I grew up watching Shakespeare The Animated Tales on Discovery Kids Latin America... back when it was for kids and not babies.Anyway, it's nice to get to see it again, and some of the animation is pretty cool (e.g. Hamlet episode). I also have a predilection for the stop motion episodes.Despite the decent digital transfer of the video, the sound is poor. I have to watch the discs on the highest volume possible, and even then it's hard to listen to it in parts.Also, the $70+ price tag is a turn-off, when even 13-episode series range from $20-35."
4,"Lovely, lively intro to Shakespeare","this set is a wonderful bridge for the younger set who may struggle slogging thru the language but who really want to understand what's going on in all these cool Shakespeare plays. It captures so much of the essence of the plays, thru the magic of Russian puppeteers (world's best, back in the day) and animators. when you couple it with the Royal Shakespeare Company troupe for the voicing, it's truly a winner. Agree that the sound transfer is less than optimal, but overall, it's the very very best kind of meaningful introduction to Shakespeare that this old English major could ever have wished for her daughter--"
2,HIt and Miss--mostly miss,"Many of these animated tales are laughable and are certain to make kids dread the Bard. While fans of animation might marvel at some technical achievements, it much like film buffs marveling at the technical achievements of Birth of a Nation--impressive, but practically unwatchable.Hamlet falls into this category--although easily the greatest [except perhaps Lear] of Shakespeare's tragedies, it is reduced here to dreary animation that looks like something one might create for Adobe Flash.Despite desperately wanting this to be a highly recommended series, I have to say you're better spending your money elsewhere."
5,Perfect addition to Christmas spode!,"I bought this set for my toddler to use when we pull out the Christmas spode. Just as I had hoped, she LOVES it! If you have kids, regardless of whether or not you have the Spode Christmas dishes, this is a must have for the holiday season!"
4,"A Welcome ""Welcoming"" Book",Very helpful and many ideas on how to make your church more friendly to guests. I recommend it.
2,Pastor,"I have little time to write reviews but even less time to read books that repeat the same info over and over. A 10 page pamphlet could have easily shared the usable information. If you are into reading a ""look what Granger does"" this is the book for you. My suggestion to the author is to stick to his project and leave communication to those who are really gifted. No ""WOW"" in this read!"
1,Dissatisfied,In the original advert I was supposed to receive a bonus camera with each set I purchased .......I NEVER received any After repeated letters and complaints to your sales department I have no answer and now you ask me if I am Satisfied. NO I am not SATISFIED. Send me my 4 bonus cameras and we will be quits
2,"Not a ""large"" size","I must have had a XXXXXL cat box before, because this is not very big as a ""Large"". My cat can barely fit in it and I have to clean it out twice a day, because it is so small. I would NOT recommend this cat box, unless you have a kitten and will need to graduate up to a bigger box."
2,Not big enough for an adult cat.,"I really should have read the reviews for this before I bought it. It's really really small. No way an adult cat would fit in this. I'm sending mine back.It's hard to give it a bad review because it's essentially as described. But I find it difficult to understand how anyone could really find this useful. As stated in a previous review only a kitten would fit in this. Kittens grow up and get big enough to no longer fit into this. So if you're thinking ""hey, this is small, my kitten would into it,"" think about what happens when your kitten grows up. You'll need a new catbox."
1,Good for a kitten,"This box is way to small, only good for a kitten. Also, as the other review states, the box is difficult to snap together. I can not be bothered to wast so much time trying to snap and unsnap this box to change litter. I would not recommend."
1,The stinkiest litter box ever,"I wish Amazon accepted a rating of zero stars, because this is the worst litter box I've ever owned. How complicated can making a decent litter box be? The fatal problem with the two Petmate large hooded litter pans that I own is that the top rim of the litter pans are not fully covered by the hood. Therefore, cat urine constantly makes it way into the seams between the hood and the pan, and the boxes reek to high heaven even with regular scooping. Don't they test drive these things?"
3,"one for you, one for your kid!","Han in the set is awful. I gave the abomination to my buddies daughter to go with that equally wretched chewee doll from the same line (she's 3or 4, what does she care). The e11 blaster was kinda fun, it shots a rocket, it's real oversized tho.BUT there's also HAN IN CARBONITE! And that's pretty awesome, especially for under $200 in 1/6th scale! the sculpt is pretty good with the exception of some size 21 shoes sticking out. The control panels (to be accurate) should be pronounced from the the sides too. I do wish it lit up but whatever, it's inexpensive so I really don't see that as a issue.Also it looks great behind the trilogy boba fett!"
1,Don't Buy...,"I have owned 30 or so of these clamps. 2 to 3 years ago they worked just fine on an 1 1/2"" pipe. I think they switched Chinese manufactrers and the new are crap. Once they are tightened down all the way around the pipe, they are still loose and swing freely around the pipe. I can't have this. If you are a DJ, get these clamps from Odessey(like the DJ cases). They make great ones! Good luck."
5,"Great clamp, but watch for the wingnuts","This is an excellent clamp that allows you to attach a variety of lighting equipment to your truss or t-bar, without leaving any marks like other types of clamps. I personally use it for my Odyssey LTP8PRO crank tripod and it fits perfectly. It also fits tubes 2"" tubes fine.Watch out though. If you are attaching a light that uses a narrow L-plate attachment, for example the Chauvet Colorstrip, you will find that the wingnuts on the clamp are too big and will not turn because the plate gets in the way. Meaning you cannot attach your light! But no problem...Simple solution: Go to any home improvement store and get a pair of black 10mm nuts, and voila...you're all set! Remember, TEN MILLIMETERS. Shouldn't cost you more than a buck.Other than that, this product should work flawlessly with your truss. So dang inexpensive too."
2,Oregon Lighthouses,I wasn't completely satisifed with this DVD. I felt it could have oferred more Scenery of the Oregon Coastline.
4,Dinner Classics The Japanese Album,"This album is calming and relaxing, it also helps create good background music. Is was deliverd in excellent condition and most expetiently. Thank you Dave J."
2,Softener for the ears...,"I am not satisfied with this version of traditional Japanese music at all. In my opinion traditional Japanese music is much more impressive and intense when played on original Japanese instruments. The best example is ""Sakura, sakura"", one of the most famous Japanese songs. When it is played on Koto and Shakuhachi (Japanese flute) instead of transverse flute it has a different feel and much better quality of expression.The whole CD is like a softener for an audience which might not be used to a non western sound. At the same time it will get a wrong idea about what Japanese music is and will miss its real quality."
4,Good Traditional Japanese music,This is one of my favorite Japanese albums. If you're into traditional Japanese music this is a CD that you should have. I lost the one that I originally had and I finally bought another one. I couldn't beat the price and I think that this album is great.This is a must have CD if you're into this kind of music or just enjoy a broad spectrum of music.
4,Exquisite japanese ambiance,"This music creates an exquisite japanese ambiance. No wonder: Jean Pierre Rampal, Yo Yo Ma and Isaac Stern: All my musical wishes during my japanese diners are fulfilled."
5,Excellent Family Movie,"Engaging actors, amusing, purposeful story. I will watch it again and share it with friends and family.I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies that are people driven. There are no high speed car chases or explosions. There is a mildly self-deprecating re-take on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with excellent dialogue and superb actors."
3,Interesting projects,Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story.
2,RFID Toys,This book was disappointing I was looking for better information on using RFID around the home. However there are some projects some might be interested in.
2,Bubble drives me crazy,"Nine times out of ten I get a bubble in the water level indicator when I pour in the water. I intend to take back this coffeemaker. I expected much better from a quality company like Krups. I must admit that the flavor of the coffee is very good and the coffeemaker brews fast. Unfortunately, however, I would give this coffeemaker a low rating because of the annoying bubble."
1,Dissapointed doesn't describe it,"We bought this unit a couple of weeks ago expecting a product that would make good coffee.It does not make good coffee. The coffee comes out too strong but lacking in robust flavor. How do they do this? I'm not sure; I use the same coffee from the same grinder with the same water in my Braun Flavor Select and get excellent coffee - full flavor and good extraction. I tried using more beans but just got stronger coffee without more flavor. I also messed with the 'small pot' control and got slightly improved coffee but still nothing like what I expect.Functionally the unit has some problems, as well. It is difficult to empty the carafe completely; the little rubber feet come out when I slide the thing across the counter and the level indicator is hard to see.Poor use of money, materials and energy."
1,Doesn't work in my PS2. Ripped off?,"I got this a few days after christmas for my girlfriend. It won't read in my PS2. It keeps saying ""please enter a Playstation or Playstation 2 format disc"". I'm sad I can't play this game with my girlfriend."
2,Pretty lame.,"Well, I borrowed this from my cousin and I loved it. So I bought it. The reason it was so fun is because it was easy. In the end it gets pretty frustrating with hard-to-move controls. So I had to stop before I broke my console from anger. I woudn't recommend it.ScoreGraphics 7.8Gameplay 6.9Overall 7.4"
4,My opinon,"This game is pretty good. The graphincs and music are really cool. I've really enjoyed this game, but some plot movers get boring quickly with the same stuff over but other than that it's totally cool."
4,Solid Gospel Intro,"This CD is a very solid intro to gospel recorded in the ""Golden Age"" - 1940's and 1950's. The recording quality is uneven, but the performances are outstanding. Many of gospel's most famous groups are represented - The Soul Stirrers, Majalia Jackson, The Staple Singers and many more. Jackson is represented by ""How I Got Over,"" her biggest hit on Apollo Records before she was signed by Columbia (and her style subdued to suit the mass-market) ""Jesus, I'll Never Forget"" highlights the incredible harmonizing of the Soul Stirrers, with R.H. Harris as lead vocalist. (Harris, of course, was later replaced by Sam Cooke who would go on to fame as a solo pop and soul artist) If nothing else, buy the disc for the live version of ""Walk Around Heaven All Day"" by the Caravans - Albertina Walker's voice is absolutely unworldly. Overall, this is a great introduction to a wide variety of groups and styles."
3,Too Fast,"This item does rewind video tapes - but @ about 100mph, I think it does it too fast. It hits the end so hard, I think it is loosening the end (I guess I should say the beginning) of the tape. It is wrecking, and will eventually wreck all of my tapes."
3,"great music, mediocre audio quality","Wilson Pickett deserves better. This was issued in the early 90s and since then standards for remastering of vintage R&B/soul/and rock have improved .... Worth getting in terms of the music, 2 discs packed with one great soul track after another .... but the sound quality lacks punch .... I am hoping that someone goes back to the Atlantic studio vaults and remasters this stuff to bring out the full wickedness of Wicked Wilson Pickett!!!"
1,Not worth the time...,"Some of the others have said this already, but here's my summary. There's no real plot, it's simply a few weeks in the life of a freelance author. Events happen that have no importance (for instance the car crash) to the story. The ending is worthless. My overall reaction is that I wasted several hours reading this when I could have been reading something interesting and/or fun. I guess it's true - you can't judge it by the cover!"
3,TERRIBLE Ending,"I loved the book but HATED the ending. The terrible, terrible ending demoted this book from a probable 4 1/2 stars to 3. It completely undid all of the good thoughts I had toward the book, in a single page. The author should be ashamed of himself. I am a writer myself and not even a ""professional"" one, but even I know that this is NOT the way to end a book. For about 10 minutes after I ""finished"" reading it, I kept looking at the binding to see if the copy I had was missing pages -- surely it had to be, I thought. When I finally realized it wasn't, I then assumed there was a sequel novel, so I scoured the book jacket for some mention of one. There was none. Then I came online to find out what was going on and saw that this ending was indeed intentional. What a rip-off!"
1,Incoherent blatherings,"SURVEILLANCE (2006) is nothing of the kind... it is nonsensical unrelated blatherings. What is supposed to be near-future fiction about what could happen if government nosiness is allowed to run amok - turns out to be just another ""Global Warming"" scare tactic book... I suppose the author just put it out to appease his liberal buddies with oneupmanship in several ""doom and gloom"" categories. Anyone who believes that in the next few years, Seattle will need to outlaw watering the grass, or there will be no more snowfall in Washington state mountains because of ""climate change"", is a ""few bricks short of a full load""... the text reminds me of the hour-long ramblings of a high school English teacher I was forced to endure in the 70's... only worse."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for a 6 week European trip so we (my two sons shared our rooms on the trip) had an alarm, a clock and a way to ""cover up"" the sound of my husband's snoring and the street noises. It was easy to pack. We tried to plug it in to the converter and it didn't run. Luckily, we had brought 4 new AAA batteries, but by the end of the first night, the new batteries had been sucked dry of their power. The clock was barely visible, too. The light would not work unless there was full battery so the purchase was pretty much worthless."
4,"While Elvis was busy making 'Clambake', the movie . . .","Jerry Lee lives up to his ego on this one. Sounds great, rocks hard. A fantastic live album from a wonderfully awful person.I'm rounding down from 4 and three-quarters stars."
5,Finally! Water that tastes like water should.,"I can't stand water! Not any bottled water, and I've tried all the locally available bottled water. I get my fluids via tea (hot and cold) as well as fruits. That's it! Until I tried Smartwater. I can easily drink half of a sport bottle in a minute. This water tastes great -- or should I say it doesn't taste? There is no chemical, mineral, taste at all. It is smooth and refreshing. For the first time in my life, I drink water and enjoy it!"
5,"Loved it, Loved it, Love it!","Great Jazz, poetry, and spoken word. A diverse group of artists are included in this boxed set. It is a window to another time that suspiciously looks similar to our own. I cherish this collection. I don't know how I survived without it. Highly recommend!"
4,Pretty absorbative...,"These pads can take quite a bit of leaking. They are not going to handle a ton of liquid, but it should save your bra for a little while until you can feed or pump. The seams are occasionally noticeable through your bra, especially right out of the dryer. This is easily fixed by stretching it back into the original shape and though wear."
4,Brief Christian defence of some tenets of capitalism,"In this short book, Grudem consistently defends some of the tenets of capitalism such as private property, profit, and competition. He methodically looks at each of these to demonstrate that like all of God's gifts they are good, and rather than being just as morally neutral or an evil (to be tolerated as a necessary evil, or to be fought against), they should be used to glorify God; he also shows how like all of God's gifts they are subject to perversion by sinful choices.Grudem bases his arguments on a handful of scriptural principles, and demonstrates that these tools of capitalism are effective techniques to achieve those principles."
2,Not as much as I had hoped for,"I'm facinated by business and marrying the Kingdom of God to the topic of business really captured my attention. I couldn't wait to read the book. Each chapter was dissapointing with few, new thoughts. I think college students and those new to business may find this useful but those who have already spent much time in business or considering how business and the glory of God go together may not find much new to chew on here. I believe the author is a professor and not a businessman--which may be why he didn't deliver as much as I had hoped."
3,Eh.,"The game was okay. Just a simple cheap puzzle game. Considering I got it for less than 2 bucks, I'd say I got my money's worth out of it."
4,"Excellent, but the Busch Quartet is still the best","For a stereo recording, do get this excellent performance by the Julliard Quartet, which is the best available of Nos. 12 & 13. But if you want the best performance of No.14 (and No.15) then you must hear the Busch Quartet (ASIN: B000000WP9). Criticised by their detractors as lacking in warmth, the energy of their Scherzo makes the Julliard Quartet seem pedestrian."
3,Preparation for speaking in church,"Not a very easy to read book, partly because the paper quality is awful. Couldn't really get to read it, as I was put off by the whole presentation. Perhaps unfair to comment further."
4,Works Fine,This unit does exactly what it says it will do - no surprises. Follow the directions and it will serve you well. The connectors hold the wires securely - making for a fairly easy connection. Plus it comes with little stickers that allow you to label each button to easily identify where each speaker pair goes. The ONLY downside is that these identifiers have really tiny type - making them very hard to read in a poorly lit area - hence only a 4-star rating.
1,worst coffee maker i ever had,"I bought this product in J&R yesterday and returned it today. The coffee tray failed to close after grinding the coffee every single time. If it wasn't the collar that stopped it from closing than it was the spring that lacked the strength to close it. The coffee comes out too weak, even if i grind 10 cups for 6 cups of water. The filter #4 that they suggest we use with the machine doesn't fit fully even if i fold it like they suggest i do. Overall it is the worst possible design and whoever designed it needs to be shot.The coffee is too weak even after i grind 10 cups worth of coffee for 6 cups of water. And it uses more coffee than my other Krups Burr grinder and coffee maker used to use."
2,Capresso 455 Fails to Impress,"Not impressed and wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I was excited to find a programable machine with a burr grinder, but the faulty bean feed system negates the feature. My first few pots ended up too weak to drink. It's gotten better, but still not dependable. I find it only works properly if I poke the beans (to aid in feeding) while grinding, which makes the Auto feature unusable. Also, settings are not calibrated to my tastes. To make what I consider ""strong"" coffee, I have to grind enough beans for a 10-cup pot, but only put 7-8 cups of water in the reservoir. Finally, the programming settings are complicated and unwieldy, and I find myself still getting very frustrated with the machine, even though I've been using it for a few weeks now. Trust me, PASS on this one. For that price, you deserve better."
1,Very disappointing,"This is a mediocre coffeemaker, especially for the price. The coffee is not tasty. It is inconsistent. No matter what the setting it sometimes brews strong and sometimes weak, and sometimes just right. It is never hot unless I pour it immediately. it is lukewarm at best if even 15 minutes go by. I am unhappy with it and will never buy a Capresso product again"
2,disappointed,"I have no problem operating this coffee maker, and I definitely like how easy it is to make coffee without having to grind it myself.However, bottom line, our old cheap coffee maker made better coffee. We experimented alot with the grind settings, many different types of coffee (exp gourmet, cheap brands, mild, medium, bold and extra bold, until we finally have a pattern we can live with. It is still not as good as the old coffee maker made....The coffee is warm, but not hot. I'm not talking McDonald's sue frenzy hot, but normal coffee hot. It stays warm longer, and doesn't get that burned flavor the old coffeemaker could get, but freshly made, it is not hot enough.My husband and I love good coffee and are both incredibly disappointed at paying this hefty price for this lackluster coffee. The convenience is nice, but definitely not worth it."
2,"A bad grinder, a great brewer!!!","There is a design flaw in the grinder of this machine. The intake valve is not steep enough, so about a quarter of the time, no beans drop into the grinder. This means that if you are not watching the machine and checking that the beans drop (say if you have programed it for the morning) you may wake up to a nice freshly brewed cup of flavorless hot water.In addition, even at the darkest setting, the coffee is pretty weak, so you have to use less water if you like strong coffee. This isn't a problem if you only want a few cups, but if you want to fill the carafe, the coffee will be weak.The coffee brewing is great, when these obstacles are overcome."
2,Mixed bag review,"This machine, although it has some great sounding features and works ok for brewing an ok cup of coffee, doesn't seem to be the one you want if you're a real coffee connoisseur and are brewing top notch coffee varieties. The various feautres of selecting brew strength as well as ground size don't seem to make much difference in the flavor/strength of the cup. In all fairness to the manufacturer, the machine I received quickly became defective so there is a chance that it was not brewing with the correct water temperature from the get go and I just didnt notice it until the heating unit began brewing luke warm coffee (within the first week). I returned the machine and ended up getting a different brand just because I had this sneaking suspicion that over the long haul it just wasnt going to be the right coffee maker for me."
1,Read the instructions first!,"Be warned: When you get these in the mail, the instructions say to rinse your breasts with warm water each and every time before and after breastfeeding/applying these gel pads. With a newborn breastfeeding up to 12 times a day, that's a lot of extra steps! I stopped using them after one day."
2,Easy,"Before, I had just connected the ends of both wires together, taped the positive and negative connections separately, then taped them all together to prevent from touching each other. I was looking for something a little bit more ""professional-looking"". Although these splice connectors are easier to connect, the sheer bulkiness is a big drawback. Add to the fact that you must use two (one for +, one for -) and you got yourself two pretty big boxes hanging from your speaker wires. Oh yea, another thing. Once you clamp that middle piece down, it goes flush with the rest of the body so reusing these aren't an option. It gets an extra star just for ease of use. Otherwise look elsewhere if you're trying to connect speaker wires."
4,A great study tool,"A great read for those new to the Jehovah's Witnesses and their governing body, the Watchtower. The book examines the Watchtower's flawed history, doctrines, and New World Translation.It also gives useful tips and verses to use when talking with a Witness. Not reccomended if you already own Mr.Ankerburg's ""Facts On"" book, because much of the same information is presented here. However this book is more current, and has a little more info than the ""Facts On"" book. I use this book for study quite often, and anyone wanting to know more about the JW's will not be dissapointed."
2,2 and 1/2 stars really...,"i'm not jw. the info here's solid and in agreement with other guides. the overall presentation's winded,confusing and irritating."
5,A ++,"I have had this camcorder for about 2 months now, Its amazing! The first I noticed when I opened the box was the size. It is SMALL! Can fit in a pocket and great for anyone on the go...great for traveling, superb picture quality. I bought mine for [price]...Brand new, factory sealed, never before used or opened. USA version, not grey market or international, and not refurbished. Came with a 1 year factory warrenty from Sony."
5,A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE PAST FROM FRIEND TO FRIEND,WHEN YOU FINSH THIS BOOK. MR DUNNE WILL BE A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND
2,Sell the ranch already!,"Back Cover description: Count Dante Galvan was ruthless. Though is broke Daisy's heart to hand over control of her family's horse farm to him, she had no alternative-she was in Dante's debt up to her ears!Part of the deal included Daisy relocating to Dante's ranch in Argentina. Daisy knew she was far too ordinary to ever become the count's wife. But could she resist Dante's demands that she repay her dues in his bed?Dante's character is OK, but I really didn't care for Daisy's. This is one of those female leads that rub you the wrong way just about every time she opens her mouth. Daisy's family owes a lot of money to Dante. I don't recall him demanding she repay him in bed, they just wind up there. She has a problem with her dad; Dante has a problem with his sister. This is the first Jane Porter book I've read. I'll try another to see if this is typical of her writing."
1,Just dissatisfied,Very disappointed with the stretches I thought it would be something different but same stretches nothing new . Don't waste your money or time. Tom Lavery
2,Started badly...and then went downhill,"As someone who has a genuine interest in flexibility and stretching, I was disappointed with this book. From the beginning there was too much non-science in the book. When it got to his example of 'healing my appendix by stretching' that was too much for me and I had to put the book down. If anyone is after a real stretching book, without all the mumbo-jumbo and metaphysical hogwash of this one, I would recommend ""relax into stretch"" by Tatsouline or even ""stretching"" by Anderson, although the latter is a little too simplistic."
1,Dangerous Claptrap,This book is dangerous to your health. It contains a lot of incorrect information. DO NOT do the exercises in this book unless you want to injure yourself.
5,life changing.,"Bob's work is revolutionary. Not only is the stretching changing my body, but it is helping me take charge of my mood and state of mind. I cannot recommend him enough."
4,"An incredible reference, but NOT for beginners.","If you have the basics of actionscript down, this book is great. I use it at least once a week for quick reference and code examples. They leave enough margin on the sides of the pages to include your own notes, and the INDEX is awesome.If you are interested in learning actionscript or are a flash person who mainly creates timeline-based SWFs, DO NOT buy this book. My suggestion would be to head over to kirupa.com and learn from the tutorials. Once you've got the hang of it then pick up this book. It fills in a lot of gaps and answers a lot of questions."
3,Geek squad alert,"Not a book to use if you are casually familiar with Action Scripting, or have only used Action Script in 5 or MX. Almost all examples are functions or object oriented programming, without a layman's definition of what either is. Good reference if you know of a human being or online chat that can explain things to you. Once I become more expert at scripting, this will probably be a good reference book, but by that time we'll have Flash 9 or 10, and all will be moot.Good reference/learning tool if you lock yourself away in a remote cabin and eat sleep and breath Flash for 4 days."
3,It's certainly a learning experience/challenge,"I've just opened the book for the first time to try to get a handle on XML and ActionScript by coding the examples on page 698. The comments attached to the code don't tell the real story of what is actually returned from the XML object/variables (my own trace commands displaying what each variable contained were more accurate) and there are a number of coding errors that I had to work out myself. It taught me something, sure, but I shouldn't have to be correcting the code along the way. It wasted time I didn't have."
2,Liberal rendition of Florida election returns,"Fantasy Hollywood movie with some bright spots. Tom Wilkinson and Bob Balaban were outstanding in their roles. Kevin Spacey was awful in his performance, too wimpy. Laura Dern over acted in this movie, go back to acting school Laura."
5,a must see political film,"Powerful and surprisingly intense, this movie recalls the 2000 election fiasco. Everyone is perfectly cast, but no one is more right for the role than Kevin Spacey. If you only watch one political movie in your life - this should be that movie."
2,Does not capture the real excitment of the day,In a sense this was the most important US Presidential Election of many decades because it launched George Bush the younger onto the world stage and resulted in two wars that crippled America. The real result of the election was never known although data collected after Bush was crowned suggest that Gore actually won. The problem was the voting machines in Florida. Whether Gore would have done better than Bush after 9/11 as Commander in Chief is also unknown although it's not difficult to speculate. The US Supreme Court ordered the recount to stop and this has to go down in history as a monumental mistake. Instead the recount should have been taken over by an independent agency.The movie is some sort of description of these events. It is not well written and there is scope for a much better treatment of the whole sequence of events. Any writers out there looking for a project?
1,Trembling Before G-d is a piece of cr-p,"Are you kidding me with this? Based on the number of awards this film had won, my interest was piqued (despite the fact that the clip that Amazon features, shows only the introductory titles.) There are a few poignant moments, but I felt that most of the people whose lives were chronicled were annoying and uninteresting. This film may be more meaningful to gay and lesbian Jews, but I found it to be uninteresting, uninspired and unremarkable in every way."
1,Rings are too small,"Not very good, rings are too small and will not stretch. Painful to wear and take off!"
5,Favorite book of one of my favorite authors,"A great science fiction book whether you're a young person or an adult. One of the best things about Hoover's books is her ability to pull a reader into the story. We don't need descriptions of the city and why things are as they are because the kids don't know any of that; the reader discovers details about the world in the book as the kids discover them. While I like most of the books by this author that I've read (I haven't been able to get all of them at our local library), I think this one and Children of Morrow are best at demonstrating that can't-put-it-down quality."
5,Testimonies,"The Two-Minute Warning title was a bit misleading for me (I thought it was something completely different), but I must say that as I began to read the book I was amazed at how wonderful the testimonies were that Pastor Hagee wrote about. The testimonies were powerful and thought provoking. I would recommend this book to all believers for it is a reminder to those of us who have lived for the Lord for a long time, and it is inspiring to those of us who are just beginning to trust the Lord. A good read!"
3,This C.D. is PHAT!!!,I love this C.D.N2DEEP is hott!They be down with my homie Jason(Bullet)they know who he is.
1,Ugh,"Unlike the similarly-themed (we won't say cookie cutter) _Lady of Hay_, in this one the historical sections of the book do not save the boring modern sections. Isobel, Countess of Fife fulfilled her family's destiny and crowned Robert the Bruce King of Scotland. For that, she was captured by the English and forced to spend years living in a cage. But I think having her life history exploited in this book is an even worse crime."
3,It's good...lots of synthetic sounding songs...,"""The Disco Years, Volume 5: Must Be The Music"" is a good album, with a selection of very rhythmic songs, but some of them shouldn't even be on this album, considering that disco lasted from the early 70's to about 1981-82. Take for instance, Nu Shooz's ""I Can't Wait"", released in 1986, and also Wish's version of ""Touch Me (All Night Long)"", released in 1984, but both of them are part of the best songs on this album. We also have the fitting disco of Diana Ross and Heatwave, but some of the other artists I never heard of before (Secret Weapon, High Fashion, Wish, Edwin Starr). This 5th album in ""The Disco Years"" series stands well with it's predecessors and is an enjoyable album for anyone who loves disco or 80's music."
3,Problem,"Man, this cd is good but it is edited. Why would they edit this cd? That is a real downfall to this cd, in my opinion"
5,Pure inspiration,"There's no shortage of movies to numb out to, but if you're anything like me you like to be educated and uplifted about some aspect of the human condition when so much of it is circling the drain. Look no further than this amazing documentary about what light can be brought to a seemingly hopeless situation if you're an artist with heart and profound compassion for his fellow brothers and sisters in Rio. The world could use a few more people like Vik Muniz. This man has vision. EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS FILM!!!"
5,Silberstang Knows the Odds,"I read Edwin Silberstang's book a long time ago and I am pleased that his analyses and ideas are still around. This man knows the math of the games and he also recommends usually good ways to play. He understands the gamblers too and knows that most of them are looking for ""action"" which is really just ""more losses.""Any gambling library should have this book.Author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"
4,All you need to know to even the score with the casino's,The smart gamble is to make the right bets that give you the best advantage possible against the house and this book breaks it down for you.
3,Ok if you like this kind of stuff like me,Good guidance on proper research methodology but lacking in being able to explain clearly and in understandable terms. Dry even for research standards.
3,useful if not perfect,"This is a helpful book; states its point then elaborates for longer than needed, but, as I said, true and useful."
4,CREATING YOUR OWN DESTINY,"THE PERFECT PITCH by Ken Rotcop is an excellent resource of information for new and seasoned writers. Pitching is EVERYTHING. Ken has the experience and the expertise to help get you where you need to be. He not only guides you through what he's learned, he gets advice from other top players in the business and tells revealing personal stories regarding pitching from other writers. Information is key in this town. This book has it. If you want to know how to give the perfect pitch, your answer is here."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have a lot of pets and I need a good can opener. I was impressed by the quality of other Cuisinart products so I spent big bucks for this opener. It worked well for several weeks but now it will not puncture the can and it takes 4-5 trys to get the opener to catch the can and make a complete circle. I realize I open several hundred cans a week, but I expected better quality from Cuisinart. I tried sharpening the cutter but this did not help."
4,Beware,"I bought this item from butterflyphoto with no shipping. Item that was sent is refurbished with a 90 day warranty instead of 3 years. I love the can opener, but am angry because I paid for a new item not a refubrished. And they will not answer emails. The can opener is great."
1,Super Dissapointed,"Had this Item for less than 6 Months and it doesn't work properly any longer. It was especially bothersome during the pre-holiday cooking. First it didn't shut off automatically as advertised, then it became dificult to start and lastly now it wont shut off once stated.Rick from Yonkers, NY."
1,Perhaps for teenagers,"Purchased this as ""best"" can opener made for my 80 year old mother so she would not have to use manual. She complained that she could not get the cans aligned. After telling her that I was sure it must be her technique, my wife and I reproduced her results. We each found it very difficult to figure out how to align the can (Yes, I read the instructions, probably 6 times) so it will actually operate. May try sideopener style next.Not recommended for adults."
1,Great can opener for a little while,"The high price paid for this can opener is not worth it. The thing worked great for about 10 months. Now, it pierces cans and then drops them a second or two later onto the counter. Yes, it looks great. No, it doesn't do what it was made for."
1,"Don't buy, bad product, Bad warranty",Worked for only 2 weeks. Terrible warranty. You must pay postage to send back for warranty service and include a $10 check.
2,"Looks neat, and fun to watch, but ....","The Budum 3000 is a ""coffee hog,"" using almost twice as much coffee (even ground finely) as other models. I found the resulting coffee quality not significantly better.It is a ""cleaning headache."" The shape of the carafe makes it difficult to clean, and to have to remove the coffee ground container before you can even have a cup of coffee was annoying.If you're looking for a good cup of coffee with minimal inconvenience, look elsewhere."
3,beautiful and silly,"I own it, actually is the second one that I got, I used to like it so much, but both got broken after six month of use.Bodum, silly thing, does not have any assistance, so the only thing to do is to buy another one. I won't do it! to me two coffe machine broken is too much, I'll change product hoping I'll find a useful one!"
2,Poor Electrical Connection,"After 2 months of use -- the electrical connection from the pot to the base works intermittently, but if I hold the pot firmly to the base then it works -- which I don't feel like doing for every pot of coffee. Was advise by Bodum's customer service to return the unit to the corporate office --"
3,Another high-priced coffee maker bites the dust,"I love good coffee...and the Santos 3000 makes good coffee. It is also a really cool design and a good conversation piece to boot. Granted it lasted longer than the ridiculous grind & brew Krups I bought the year before (3 month life span, then off to the dump); but alas, after a year and a half it too has bitten the dust. The pot has been leaking for some time (not replaceable) and it's quite messy. The discoloration of the plastic on both pieces is almost immediate--and after a time even the specialized cleaner that I've been using doesn't clean it. Planned obsolescence aside, it just seems a $100 coffee maker shouldn't have to be purchased this often. Heavy sigh: off to look for yet another model."
2,Uses Twice as Much Coffee as a French Press,"See other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning. Cool design, but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press. I only used this coffee maker 3 times, and reverted to the press."
2,Weird Science,"The only thing to really like about Bodum 3000 is watching it make the coffee, which is interesting about three times and then the experience is all downhill from there.First of all, this ""coffee maker"" should come with a year supply of coffee because you are going to need a ton of it. It takes about three times as much to get the same taste of good strong coffee and you end up with four cups less then the original amount of water you put in. Oh and when it is time to dump it, you have three times as much to dump and about three times as much work because it is a bit of hassle as well.Finally it is not dishwasher safe, in this day and age of good dishwashers and busy schedules I no longer support anything that is not dishwasher safe and intended to be used daily. I could live with the filter not being dishwasher safe but the whole thing, not o.k."
4,I like to watch...,"When watching a coffee maker brew becomes part of ""Breakfast Theater"" you know there's something special happening.That is 'clearly' the case with the Bodum 3000-10USAA Electric Santos. Making coffee with this machine is a little like viewing those cut-away drawings of intricate automobile engines: while the exact process is not always understood the view is mesmerizing. I've had requests from dinner guests to tell them when I'm brewing coffee so that they could see 'it' in action.And what of the quality of the brew? For me it's flawless. I have an attitude about coffee and a reputation too. I often mix my own blends of beans and grind my own too. This means that the machine has an obligation: Perform or Be Gone.The reason for 4, not 5 stars: Cleaning. Coffee oils seem to love the plastic parts and nylon filter of this showpiece. I'm considering making the obligation to 'clean-up-after' the 'admission fee' for allowing my guests see Amazing Science At Work."
1,I GIVE UP!,"ARGHH! I'm on my 3rd replacement that Bodum sent me. Everything goes wrong with this machine, which is hard to use, hard to clean and breaks down if you use it more than a few times a week! Now it doesn't keep the coffee hot enough after it sits for more than 5 minutes and turns off and on. This coffee maker has given me so many problems that I wouldn't be surprised if it burns down my house next."
4,Great Season on laughs,I like the show. I bought the second season not as funny as the third season. This season is worth the moolah!
4,"While nice to have the extra set, I don't get any more milk","I bought these to see if bigger horns helped me get more milk. They do not. The inserts are a joke--totally useless and annoying. The larger horns are convenient for when my regular ones are dirty, but are no more or less comfortable and I get the same amount of milk, if not a little less."
3,"Decent overview of changing the role of a CFO, nothing more","CFOs should become more involved in choosing projects and start to help their co-workers in product development, etc. use financial tools to make decisions. There, I just told you the guts of the book. The rest of it lacks detail for something written by an accounting firm.This book might be useful to a young person who is trying to decide whether they want a career in finance or not. Because it is trying to discuss how good companies will use their CFOs in the future. Or for that matter, someone just starting out in finance to see what types of jobs are out there."
5,Very Cute,"This book is adorable and well written and well illustrated. I guess that singers/songwriters carry over their writing skills to the pages, because I know Gloria writes some of her own music and it's another form of story telling. Therefore this book is great and being a mother herself, I guess she knew exactly the kind of stories young children love to hear. I have read this to a little cousin of mine and he was enthralled the whole way through. Noelle is a cute little character (that is actually one of her real dogs) and it tells a story of all these things that happen to her very interestingly. The real message is really about the dog having a hard time fitting in and it's a metaphor for kids feeling left out and not included and different. My cousin also loved all the colors and pictures. This is a great book that I really recommend parents to read to their kids (and enjoy yourself too)."
4,Love the idea,"Great coffeemaker for being on the go and not having to clean out a pot when you are done. I wish that the markings on the inside were a little clearer to see when only using it for one cup and that other cups would fit, but otherwise, I love this machine."
4,Great Value,So far this has been a great little coffee maker. We wanted something easy that we could just grab and go from and this is it. The coffee stays hot in the cups and it's easy to make one cup or two.
4,Convenience and price,"For the ""on the go"" one to two person household, this coffee maker makes sense. I like that there's no carafe to clean and I can choose my own coffee, unlike the pods needed for Keurig-like coffeemakers. The brew is good unlike the 4-cup coffeemakers where the coffee is either too weak or the taste is burnt because I've added to much grounds to compensate for the weak taste. The price is very reasonable too. This product was difficult to find in stores, so I was very pleased to find it @ amazon.com."
2,Filter gets clogged,I had the one mug brewer by another company for years and the power button finally went. They did not make it anymore so I tried this one. All of the water does not siphon through the filter and when I remove the mug it just keeps dripping and makes a mess. So I have to dump the filter when its piping hot which is not great.
4,love machine- can't get my coffee to traste the same,we love this machine- it uses less coffee- we make 1 mug and decide into 2 cups- then if we want more make another- uses only 3 tbls. of coffee- BUT-- I cannot get coffee to taste as good as old dripper into carafe- not sure why - have tried lots of tricks- but coffee still not tasting good
1,Tastes like Plastic,"I returned this coffeemaker after three weeks, because it made coffee that tasted like plastic. I followed all of the instructions, but could not get rid of the plastic taste. I even tried using ceramic cups for the coffee, but that did not work either. I love the concept, but this implementation leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Cuisinart Two-to-Go Coffeemaker,"While I am satisfied with the product, Amazon's shipping via USPS left much to be desired. I was informed to expect it within 6-7 days, and when it didn't arrive, I called twice three days apart and both Amazon and the postal service couldn't locate it. I was given the choice of cancelling the order and re-ordering it (which was out of stock and would take three more weeks), or simply receive a refund. It finally arrived after 10 days-it only traveled about 150 miles to get here!?"
1,Only worked twice,"I received this as a gift and LOVED it -- for 2 days. The third time I tried to use it, the Power light didn't come on and I noticed that the ""on"" button was stuck in the depressed position. I tried plugging it in to different outlets with no luck. I tried to get the power button unstuck, and that didn't work either."
3,good and bad,"I love the idea. It's great, I'll make the 2 cups, drink one at home and take one to work.One major problem though. The holder that holds the coffee filter only has 2 tiny holes for the water to pass through. If so much as one little coffee ground gets stuck in the hole, the filter overflows and you have a coffee explosion. I've had my machine for a year and it happens about every other month. HUGE MESS. Other than the every other month explosion, it's a great machine."
2,Low Quality Mugs,"The coffee brewer works as advertised and does the job. However, the mugs are of very low quality. Within a few weeks of using the mugs, they had broken from their plastic mounts within the housing and made the mugs useless. I cannot recommend based on this."
3,It does the job,"this radio does the job for the price, the bluetooth works great, but iam giving it 3 stars bcuz the sound of the player is a bit poor, and the radio reception is very poor. But again for the price its great and it does the job."
5,Bluetooth work great !! love these cheap decks,I have had many dual audio decks in my vehicles over the years..never had one fail on me... they are nice and cheap with normal functions and get the job done on a budget .. this unit adds Bluetooth for music and phone calls!!
4,Good Deal.,"Nice receiver, pulls in FM stations exceptionally well. Bought to replace Ford OEM radio that kept losing track of FM where I live, and scan unable to lock in on anything. This Dual locks in on piles of stations I didn't even know were there.No discernable change in sound quality over the original OEM radio. (Of course the limitation is the speakers in my vehicle anyway )The Bluetooth DNLA is also terrific, and auto-syncs to my phone almost instantly. Since I keep my MP3 libaray on my phone, all my music is also automatically just there on the car radio, so I haven't even bothered with the USB or CD on this Dual. The kids have used the aux input for their iPod nano's, and like it.Although some reviewers have complained, I do not find the blue lighting bothersome or too bright at all. Button layout is acceptable, and buttons have nice tactile feedback.Pretty happy with this radio, and all at a pretty cheap price."
5,Great deal!,"Easy, basic install. Has all the features it claims to have, nothing more, nothing less. I use it with my iPhone all the time. Great buy at under $60."
5,Dual XDMA,Great stereo. Great price.... Bluetooth function stinks.... microphone is marketed for visor but it only fits on a shirt! Use double sided tape to mount
5,Does exactly what it.claims to do,I installed in my son's mustang. If I had bought the plug adapters instead of using wire nuts it would have been a 10 minute job. Works great for what he uses it for which is playing music from his phone either with the Bluetooth stream or the aux jack. Great stereo for the price.
4,great,"I'm a huge Avalon fan and I'm so glad that I took a chance and got this cd. The lyrics are wonderful, their deep and its obvious that Avalon is very talented.Just give it a listen and you'll see what I mean. My favorite song is ""only for the weak"" and ""In not of."" Their voices blend in complete harmony. I'm so glad that I got this cd."
5,This has to be one of the best worship CD's of all time,I've loved Avalon ever since I first heard them in 1996. This has to be their best CD. It has so many good worship songs. It also has songs that people who don't like Christian music could listen to and love. This is the most awesome CD in my collection.
2,"Wow, it was cool",This album impressed me. I had to give it at least 2 stars. I loved it. It inspired me to walk with God closer.
5,Fresh sounds for a rising group,"Avalon has done it. They have captured the heart of contemporary Christian music in this album. It will make you dance as well as cry. With the wide variety of music and lyrics, there is something for everyone in this album. Get it today- you won't regret it!"
4,Great little Map for Key West-other keys just a bit.,"This is a great little map for Key West. Its compact size allows you to carry it with ease in pocket or purse. I wouldn't purchase it as a map for the rest of the Keys, though, as it concentrates mostly on Key West.If you're going to Key West, I have no problem recommending purchase of this map."
2,Textbook,Two words. Wordy and confusing. This book could be edited down to pamphlet size and still get it's point across. Not very well organized and this book is really a series of quotes strung together with conjunctions. Recommended for insomniacs.
4,No complaints here,"Classical Aerosmith tracks top to bottom. There's nothing new on this album, which is a very good thing. Worth the purchase."
5,Greatest Hits : 1973-1980,"This is a brilliant compilation spanning the first 7 years of Aerosmith's career. There's only ten tracks, but you could play this CD all the way through with ease. Check it out."
3,Solid CD,It may not be the best CD collection of music around but it definately a Cd to add to your collection so you could have some good music to listen to with your buddies or listen to in the car while on a long car trip.
4,Clasico de clásicos!!,Aerosmith es de lo mejor... Esta recopilación trae lo mejor de la primera etapa de esta banda.
2,If there's nothing better....,"This is definitely not a bad collection, but there are so many better ones out there, that this should not be your first choice. The song Sweet Emotion has been completely destroyed on this album. the entire bass intro has been cut out, and the song starts about an entire minute into it. There really is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The song starts at a terrible place too. It sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song, then just stuck it on the cd that way. Again, not a terrible compilation, but definitely not a good first choice."
2,"GeoSafari mineral collection, not what I expected!","I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. It was on his wish list. I was ok with buying rocks, but when I recieved them the box was very small. I will be sending this back, very disappointed! Now, I have to find something else for him. I don't recommend this!"
3,Untold Stories from Columbine,"As I watched this video, I began to realize how drawn-out this whole Columbine martyr thing has been. Don't get me wrong, it's a tragedy what happened to this young girl, but enough already. The first part is basically Rachel Scott's father addressing a church congregation, talking about his daughter and the alleged premonitions that pointed to her death and to the other Christian victims' deaths at Columbine. The rest of the video is her funeral, which is very poignant and probably the better part of the video, because it's about her life and not all the hoopla and stories surrounding her death. You will have a hard time keeping your eyes dry during her funeral. Overall it's just more Christian propaganda stemming from Columbine. Other than that I can say that it was watchable and some could find inspiration in the story of Rachel Scott's life and how she chose to live it."
3,Good questions that have been asked in other books,"Personally I gained little from this book because I have seen these questions in other books. However, if you are new to self help, these questions could be quite helpful."
1,Heavily Edited,"They cut out & edited down alot of the nude scenes on here which ruin the movie since lets face it, that's what we watch these movies for. Catch it on Showtime or Cinemax when you can under it's other name (Vipers)."
4,Great product,"This is a great gift item because you get a lot for the relatively inexpensive price. The brushed stainless steel is lovely and has a good feel to it. It adds a high end look to the kitchen, especially since stainless is such a popular look for upscale kitchens. My favorite piece is the pasta utensil."
2,Beware - If it seems too good to be true...,"I can confirm that the cartridges shipped with this photo value pack have a fraction of the ink capacity of normal cartridges. While there is nothing at all that indicates this in any of HP's marketing materials (bad HP) it becomes clear when you install them. The ink level gauges on the printer show much smaller bars for these than the regular cartridges - and indeed they do run out very quickly compared to normal cartridges.Face it - HP is all about making very large profit margins from selling ink, and they aren't dumb. If you want to buy an ink combo pack of full cartridges you can search amazon for HEWLETT PACKARD 02 COMBO PACK - you will find this listed as of today at $60 and not that much of a discount vs. buying single cartridges."
1,Feel like I have been ripped off by HP,"I thought I was getting a great deal by buying the ""HP Custom 02 Value Pack"" (6 cartridges with 150 sheets photo paper), until I noticed that the Staples price for the ""HP 02 Color Combo Pack"" (5 cartridges without black cartridge or photo paper) was significantly higher than the Value Pack! Go figure! For this equation to work, there must be a lot less ink in the Value Pack! I just wish that HP would disclose the facts. Makes me feel like I got ripped off.***Update***My suspicions have been confirmed! When I use these cartridges, I have discovered that the printer cartridge ""ink level bar"" only goes up part way. But when using one of the HP Color Combo ink catridges, the ""ink level bar"" goes up all the way and shows as full. Buy the HP 02 Color Combo Pack instead!"
1,HP Sneakily Confirms Less Ink in these cartridges,"Here is my chat exchange with HP today....the truncated part of my message asked clearly if the ink in the paper-combo pack was less than the ink in the separate packages.Myra: Welcome to HP Total Care for All-in-One products. My name is Myra. How may I assist you today ?Albert Karel: Hello. This 6180 is my 4th HP printer. As you can see, I am a good customer. In the Staples store I went to purchase ink. I saw two ways: 1) the combination pack with 4x6 paper, and b) the color combo pack plus a separate black cartridge. It seemed that the combination pack was a good value. Staples assured me that the amount of ink was the same as in the second option. I purchased it. Now I read that HP puts much less ink in the same cartridges and that by buying the combination 1 packa ...(truncated)Myra: I understand your concern.Myra: Staples had assured some thing which is not correct."
3,"As advertised, but misleading","OK, so I am sure you probably get 24 cent photos using this ink and paper. Great. But, what's misleading is that these cartridges contain less ink then if you buy them separately. We print alot of color, but not many 4x6 photos. I seem to be replacing color cartridges often (but not the black). I'm going to try buying the individual cartridges and using Staple's recycling program to get them at a cheaper price."
1,Too Good to be True!,"We own an old Photosmart C6280; had it for years. Until recently, we were buying this combo pack from Staples. I compared this ""w/ black and paper"" pack to the ""color only"" combo pack and could never find anything to justify why the ""color only"" pack was double the price. After years, we just started piling up photo paper. This past time, I went and bought just the color combo pack, because I was so sick of photo paper; I didn't care if I was going to pay nearly double. To my horror, I came to realize that this value pack only gives you half the volume of ink. HALF! It really should say that on the package. I feel so deceived!Unless you WANT photo paper, don't bother with this value pack!"
4,Simple Alarm Clock,You don't have to read though the insturction before you can operate the alarm clock. It's easy to set the alarm time with the front bezel. A little night light turns on while you push the snooze button to allow you to see the time in the dark. The radio has decent reception and acceptable sound clarity (like an old AM radio). The only minus is that it is very difficult to distinquish if the the alarm is turned on by the yellow green color indicator (not an lit indicator). You can tell if the alarm is on or off by knowing the position of the switch at night.
4,Fairly Good,"This is the only CD of the Brahms violin sonatas that I own. I have learned to enjoy the violin sonatas with this CD, but I do think that they could be performed better. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it does seem that Barenboim is somewhat timid in his approach. The violin sound is somewhat thin too. The tempos might be a problem with some, though I can't compare them with other recordings. However, these performances are enjoyable, and the CD is not expensive. This CD was recorded live in 1989. The sound quality is fairly good. There is applause at the beginning of the first track, as well as after the last movement of every sonata. This is not a bad CD, but it is probably not the best choice.Violin Sonata No. 1 in G Major1st Mov. - 10:082nd Mov. - 7:243rd Mov. - 8:04Violin Sonata No. 2 in A Major1st Mov. - 7:442nd Mov. - 6:083rd Mov. - 4:59Violin Sonata No. 3 in D Minor1st Mov. - 7:222nd Mov. - 4:383rd Mov. - 3:014th Mov. - 5:45"
2,BORDERLINE BRAHMS AT BEST,"If you can get past Perlman's swooning, vibrato-immersed violin playing, the rather thin sound of this live recording (which, by the way, is noted nowhere in the liner notes, on the CD, or on the back of the jewel box), and the intrusive applause, then, well, you might enjoy these performances. Perhaps not. Of course, since these ARE live performances, a certain latitude must be given; however, that said, I still find this Brahms wanting... too often. If anything, Barenboim pulls more interesting detail from this music than does Perlman, whose closely-miked violin tends to constantly overshadow his partner's piano. These artists try admirably, but there are simply too many moments of sloppy, stilted ensemble work, too much ""pointing,"" and an overall sense that an imbalance exists in more than just the recording itself.[Running time: 65:50]"
3,The acoustics sabotage the performances.,The acoustic of this recording is very dry and distant. Perlman's tone in much better appreciated in his recording with Ashkenazy. Baremboim and Ashkenazy are both excellent pianists. It is nice to compare the recordings but I would go for the recording of Perlman with Ashkenazy.
4,Good buy,"12pt sockets are tough to find in 1/4"" drive, and these are as good, if not better as any made out there."
3,Bought for humid enviroment,"I bought this for a humid cage 75% to 90% humidity. It worked great for about a month or so. My plants grew great in it. Had a four layer system and would mist daily. It started molding. Had to completely re-do my cage. Good bedding, just not for what I needed."
1,P.O.S,"I bought this for my boa and it ended up giving her scale rot thus leading to her death. I strongly recommend NOT buying this P.O.S substrate, and yeah it looks very good but a dead reptile does not.."
1,Returned this the next day,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon, I got it from the place that pets go 'cause there's one that's next to my work. I soaked the first brick for over 2 hours with no change whatsoever. 'Nuff said. I returned it the next day--and it still hadn't changed from its original brick form! So far, my favorite coconut fiber bedding product is the All Living Things (the home brand) from the other large pet chain--it's SMART to shop there! ; Save your money--and your time--go with the cheaper stuff that actually does what it's supposed to!"
5,Awesome,This product is by far my favorite of all the beddings i have tried for my many animals. It's cheap and high quality also i would suggest buying off of amazon simply because its much cheaper then buying it from a pet store.
4,"Author, so I'm biased!","I wrote this in 1997, and have since moved to Roswell NM and continued researching. I look at this book as my ""good freshman effort"" although my views have grown a bit since then (not changed, just grown!). Visit AlienStranger.com for my complete works on this subject (many sites) and WHILE THEY LAST I have found half a box of copies of this book that were never sold - see AlienResistance.org to obtain a copy.Guy Malone"
4,Eyeopener!,"So real and well researched. I have had encounters, and now the picture is clear. Pele,the goddess of the volcano here and her crew are working with these flying saucers. Ive been saying this and people think Im nuts. How this author plainly explains the big picture, is perfect timing for the near future. Read and be aware....please..."
5,Great Voice!!!,I had the pleasure of hearing this young lady in San Francisco with her great band. Have since purchased their CD and think it is the greatest. Love the smooth sound.
4,karen wants an orange cat but her fam picks out a black cat.,"karen's cat boo boo is getting old and her fam wants to get a younger kitten to brighten up boo boo. karen wants to get an orange cat and name him Pumpkin. but her family picks out a black one. karen does not like the black kitten at first, but at the end of this story karen and the black cat(pumpkin) became real close in love."
4,Stax '07,"I seem to recall having a 45 of ""Soul Finger"" on the Volt label when I was about 4 years old. I still think it's a great song. The Bar Kays were similar to Booker T & The MGs, in fact Booker himself wrote the liner notes. This is great Stax/Volt instrumental music from the 60s. I just wish the sound quality was louder."
5,He's great,"Just recently I was lucky enough to discover Mr. Vaughan. I read him at least once every 3 books as my busy reading schedual allows. This particular book "" The Brave and the Lonely"" is a book you can read over and over again and still enjoy. Max Inman apache8b1@hotmail.com"
4,"Some real gems here, hidden no more","Forgotten album tracks from Dionne Warwick's Scepter output in the 1960's, fashioned by songmeisters Burt Bacharach and Hal David with just as much care as her singles--many of which are hidden hits in their own right. Naturally, us vinyl die-hards will complain about the usual omissions, but for a B-sides package, you can't go wrong with ""Hidden Gems"". Stand-outs: the gently popping ""I Smiled Yesterday"", the dramatic ""Let Me Be Lonely"", the wisftful ""Unlucky"", and the herky-jerky rock/R&B fusion of ""You Can Have Him""(which Dionne herself hated)."
5,Loving The Art,"This book does not disappoint. Artistically, it is fabulous. You can't find books like this anymore. It is beautifully illustrated. Recommended to anyone who spends time with small children. They will love it!"
1,Not worth watching,"A straight-laced businessman gets blackmailed by a woman he commits adultery with. His boss and co-worker tries to help him out of this situation (that the co-worker got him in).I got this film to watch because the businessman is from Detroit (my hometown). The best scene to me was when the two co-workers beat an accomplice with a bag of...whatever and one says ""Welcome to Detroit"". Yes, the movie is that bad. Skip this one."
4,A good read,"This is one of those historical romances based on a romance and the investigation of a smuggling ring. The H and h are thrown together accidentally and after a fiery start where they really dislike each other, they begin to fall in love whilst the H is investing a traitor working with the smugglers. The story flowed and I didn't feel the need to skim over the smuggling plot as it wasn't too boring. The h wasn't too annoying despite the fact that she was a spinster, independent and against marrying. The H was funny because he was macho and not keen on marriage either as he'd been hurt in the past. Once again his past hurt wasn't a big deal and didn't spoil the romance.The first part of the book was very entertaining with quite a few laugh out loud moments. The second part focussed on solving the traitor problem and the developing romance. I enjoyed the secondary characters too.All in all in was a good read for a lazy Autumn weekend."
2,"Well written, but a borrowed plot","Candance Camp writes well. I especially like her characters, which are vivid and not the same from book to book. I was really disappointed in this one, however, because large chunks of the plot are borrowed wholesale from Georgetter Heyer's The Unknown Ajax. Although Camp is good, Heyer is great. If you want to read a *really* good yarn about that includes a young man over his head in a local smuggling ring, try The Unknown Ajax."
5,A Perfect Starting Point for OO,"This is one of my top tech books, and I've passed along / recommended it more than once. Keep in mind that title: ""Learning"". This will not carry you end-to-end through C#, nor will it be the all-encompassing reference for the C# programmer who wants to keep up to speed. Instead, the audience is the new programmer, or the procedural programmer new to OO. When I think back to my first introduction to OO (a Java 1.0 boot-camp-styled course that made my brain spin in its casing), I wish I'd had this book: it's nicely paced, it begins at the beginning, and it gets you on your feet in regards to knowing how to program in the language.Note that this review is for this edition of the book, but newer editions have since been released. I still recommend the book, and its approach, to anyone new to OO in general or C# in particular. Get started here, then dig deeper with the Bible-sized tomes if you need."
3,Not as good as I expected...,"I've read the high reviews for this book that's why I bought one, but eventually got disappointed with the lack of depth on explanations esp.regarding OOP. I suggest that beginners get a different learning reference. Jeffrey Suddeth's book is compact yet organized and topics are well-explained, but you must supplement that with other books as well.My experience is, you won't learn so many things in just one book, you need 2 or 3 while learning. I have yet to review Andrew Troelsen's book which is forthcoming. If you happen to find one that explains in detail the important topics like generics, collections, events and delegates and OOP, please help others by posting your review. Thanks"
1,Code Broken,The only eseeence of this book is to be able to make the code work and learn from it. I spent hours configuring it and still cannot compile the code. There are errors everywhere. Author has given many steps to configuring the code and database and it is more complicated than it should be. I have downloaded many large examples in past and made them to work in short time. In this case it is never ending. I am still trying but am pretty sure I will not be able to run this application without wasting days which defeats the purpose. In my opinion download free samples from asp.net and other sources. This buy is waste of money and more importantly waste of time.
4,Amazing watch for the money,"This watch is amazing and I have had several people ask me about my new ""Rolex Daytona Cosmograph""!!The style and quality cannot be beat for the price and the watch works like a charm. The jeweler who resized the band commented on it and she treated me like a man who had just purchased a $10,000 watch...she gushed over the watch and took her time putting it on and testing the fit several times till it was just right...One of the pins in the band backed out a couple times because the split design was not creating the friction to keep it in place. I fixed it myself by spreading the halves of the pin apart and reinserting...all good now, but that is the only thing I would call a quality defect.The design of the day and date dials look beautiful, but are nearly impossible to read at a glance.If you want the attention that comes with wearing a watch that appears to have cost many thousands of dollars for what you would pay for a nice dinner...this is your watch."
5,More frightening than fiction,"This is not only a great read, it's a frightening one! Fifteen years ago, Robert Graysmith also wrote about the Zodiac killer, but in a very different way. He gave us the details -- the story of Zodiac's crimes, along with his own speculation about a few suspects. Kelleher and Van Nuys have worked this killer from the inside-out, taking us through his mind by using the killer's words. It's hard to imagine anything more real than this. What makes the book even stronger is that it is exceptionally well written. It's in the ""can't put it down"" category.Highly recommended!"
4,A masterstroke of gonzo-wartime journalism.,"Robert's gem is a rare look at a horrific world that most of us have only glimpsed behind the muted green lens of night vision camera work. Instead of the usual talking heads who have been regulated to a rooftop to photograph anti-aircraft fire, we are privy to some of the cruel and ridiculous inner workings of Iraq. Combining humor with raw fact, Roberts is also adept at giving names, and personalities to a people who usually end up as faceless statistics. Next time though, sombody better get this guy a flack vest."
2,eh,"So, My boyfriend had a radio similiar to this one, but it was smaller. so the buttons on his stopped working,so I bought him this one; the radio came quick, there was nothing wrong with the seller, but the radio kind of sucks.I read reviews before purchasing it, but now I'm just waiting to return it after only like 3 days. He has a mitsubishi lancer,and his radio tilts a little bit upwards, so the face plate that comes down, doesn't go down very far so you can'tsee the screen at all. the buttons are kind of cheap and it's hard to read the numbers 1-6 because they decided to putthem all together like a square, and put stuff like 1s 2s 3s 4f and stuff like that so you can't read them very well.also, I'm not sure if it's because he hooked it up wrong, but since putting the radio in, the sound of the radio fadesfrom loud to quiet, then loud again a lot. so overall, did not like. but that might not be the same for everybody."
4,"Quite funny, ended quietly",I haven't read a Wambaugh in over a decade so thought I would give him a return read.The writing reminds me a lot of Carl Hiaasen which is a huge compliment but lacked the bite of the Floridian. Found the book to be entertaining and had some twists in it that I enjoyed just that it ended very quietly with no conclusion for some of the characters.Not his greatest (try The New Centurions or The Choir Boys) but I enjoyed it.
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Recommended by my uncleWhat impressed me: I really liked the story itself. The premise of harbor detectives, the sailing world, and the tone of the dialogue. The mystery was well done and surprising too.What disappointed me: A little too ""hard-boiled"" for my taste. Got that rough, tough guy feel that always alienates me from being able to connect with the detectives in this type of mystery.Recommended: Not especially. I like my detectives more endearing."
1,A waste of time and money,"This volume was recommended to me as an excellent read, full of wit and wordplay. It is not. It is instead an annoyingly self-concious little book, full of excessively cute asides from the author and poor attempts at wordplay that would not amuse anyone over the age of ten. Most annoying is the attempt to parrot the metaphorical style Douglas Hofsteader used so brilliantly in his ""Goedel, Escher and Bach"". Having spent close to $20 on this volume, I forced myself to read a third of the way through it before tossing it aside"
3,Great wordplay but not a great plot,i loved this book for one reason..the words. Noon is an expert at wordplay and it is evident in this..he is able to make words more energetic and amusing and smooth as well then any other author i have ever read. The thing this book lacks is the plot i thought it was a little week. It might just be me though i only read this cause i am such a big fan of Noon and although i enjoyed reading it i didnt like the whole Alice in wonderland bit. All in all though i recomend it but read some of his other books if you really want a feel for Noon's writing capabilities
4,Taste is good,Great taste.Had other ingredents not just black seed and honey as I thought. The taste was realy good but I would not have bought this at the price I did knowing the ingredents. Again the taste was great just not what I expected
2,Gould should stick with Bach,"Glenn Gould's rendition of these great works are, to say the least, unconventional. He never liked Mozart and I don't think he was really interested in Beethoven either. His rediculously fast tempos in the ""Pathetique"" and the ""Moonlight"" sonatas, for example, makes me feel like he wanted to get this recording over with quick because he had a hot date or something and his humming in some of these pieces gives me the feeling that he was bored. If you want a good recording of the beethoven piano sonatas this one isn't it. Try Alfred Brendel, Wilhelm Kempff, Daniel Barenboim, or get Jeno Jando's recording with Naxos for a great deal. I must give Glenn Gould some credit, though. his recording of Beethoven's 5th Symphony, transcribed for piano by Franz Liszt, is actually really good."
3,Gross Income factor X100,"This is an old book but all the principles described still apply to today's market. The one item that caught my attention was the formula he used to recognized a potential investment. If you were to purchased a rental property and the rental income is $985 per month than you should pay no more than $98,500 for this investement( $985 X 100 )."
3,Good sound,"Would be nice if you could retract the cord without having to unplug from the player, but all else is good."
3,Not grippy = disappointing,"Our Oneida cutting board does not grip the counter, and slides all over the place when we use it. Maybe it's warped? Very disappointing and a little dangerous when you're wielding a sharp knife! And I have to say that the handles, which seemed like a great feature at first, really aren't necessary when there are raised rubber edges that are easy to grab. Cut-out handles on both sides takes away some valuable cutting board space. We'll be replacing ours with another brand."
5,Used it for a month so far so good,Fitted into the dishwasher. Cuts well. What more can a homemaker ask? I'll try to update my review as I use it overtime.

4,Spenco Rx Ball of Foot,"I bought these inserts because I have problems with the ball of my feet and it's only my right side. Unusual because you don't need to tape these down to the shoe insole. They are placed inside the shoe and you slide your feet into the shoe and it stays in place. I haven't used them in my running shoe since I have a taped down one in the shoe. I used them on my walking shoe but removed them after I noticed that when I am walking, the ball of my right feet doesn't hurt. It's only when I run. Too bad the company doesn't sell only one side. It would be cheaper."
3,"Stays put, but awkward","Spenco make great products. I put these in my shoes and although they stayed in place, the ball of my foot didn't really feel all that great after wearing these with some high-heeled shoes. I'd suggest the full or 3/4 foot product, if possible, for extra cushion. These are okay, but not great. :)"
3,Sony vaio a regular laptop !,"Weights a lot.Does`t heat except on bed.Comes with a lot of programs, mayority are 30 day trials.Cero cables,only with one aol cd, and one manual.The computer freezed only once.Has norton antivirus 2003 and it sucks.There is a $100 rebate for this laptop on internet and i have never seen the refund.Problem detection with fellowes usb mouse.Hard drive is 37.26gb says win xp.No floopy!!!Ati videocard(64mb of vid memory,can be hacked to get 128mb). Battery doesn`t last more than one hour.Has a hidden partition with the installation programs.It takes some time to load.I tried to buy a better battery, but this laptop does`t exist anywhere, no one has heard of this laptop, can`t find the brand of it`s internal components or serial numbers.Almost impossible to buy parts for this laptop.So take good care of it.The only good thing: it comes with one game and real player basic."
3,"For what it is, its not too bad","I bought this refurbished for $800 usd. It has yet to die on me. The quality is good. It does get hot after some use, so I usually use a Targus cool pad. Does the trick. I have had to wipe the HD memory (due to a virus, stupid me) and got an all-driver install disc off of ebay. It did the trick. It is not a game machine but it can do justice to the older games. I can play City of Heroes on this laptop, but the graphics suck. It's great for surfing the net, doing word processing, watching dvd's, and playing not too complicated games. The battery life is fairly horrible. I haven't been able to get more then 1.25 hours out of it, usually less if you are using the WiFi (I bought a separate card). For what the computer is, its adequate. I wouldn't pay more than $800 for it. But its okay."
1,"Terrible computer, Terrible service",go here to see the full storyhttp://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/5449/?o=920there is a class action suit in the making.
2,Lacks plot and depth,"This book was highly rated so I got it. I was disappointed in the fact it was a short read first of all. Secondly, the plot is truly lacking when you never really experience any true paranormal romance. There is no interaction in this book that spells L O V E. The encounters between the leading female and the paranormal male just do not exist. Thirdly, the ending was horrible. The book left me asking why did I get this and where is the actual book I bought? This is more like a short story."
5,Netter's anatomy flash cards,"Excellent product, one of the best ways to learn anatomy. However, it was supposed to come with STUDENT CONSULT online access PIN code but this was missing and took a while to get it from Publishers"
4,great flashcards,"great flashcards. nice way to review pictures from netter's atlas when you are on the road. not comprehensive (not all the plates/structures included) but includes a pretty decent selection from the netter's atlas. also, the online student consult makes it easy to study flash cards when you want to use just your computer to study."
3,Semi-Magical,"Everyone raves about this massager and I agree that it has great power. However, it is quite noisy and heats up very quickly. Thinking about buying the attachments to see if that helps because the head is way to bulky for reaching precise spots.Great for body massages, but so far not too impressed for intimate use :/"
2,"""Vibrate-less""","It works, but the vibration isn't nearly as strong as one I purchased years ago. I wonder about the glowing reviews."
3,Jackhammer hummer,"Okay, so I originally got this Hitachi as a sex toy. It FAILED! The vibrations were like a massive earthquake..or bodyquake I guess. Also the original head (I haven't tried the head replacements) is really firm and has a texture; so it adds pain to my sensitive lady bits. HOWEVER, the Hitachi is very promising as a back massager (figure that, it does what it was made for). But it is still a little too powerful for my legs and tickles my butt, I can only comfortably use it on my back. The texture is still uncomfortable but adding oil to the skin fixes this problem. The Hitachi is nice for a couple; my husband and I take turns using it on each other. Other down side, it is fairly loud and large and only has two settings - Earthquake or Apocalypse."
2,worst money spent,"Purchased as a personal massager but this thing is huge. Head is very large and whole unit is over a foot long and too heavy. Might work OK with a partner but difficult to use alone. I achieve a quicker, better orgasm with a $6 pocket rocket. Save your money!"
4,Very nice.,"I have enjoyed this product. The high is a little too intense for my pleasure, but the low speed hits the spot just right. It is exactly what I wanted to replace my well loved former massager."
1,Quality has gone down...last two lasted less than six months,"My first lasted three years and I replaced it only because the cord went out. After this I bought one that lasted a little over a year and in the last year I've bought two...each one failing in less time than the last. I don't use it heavily nor has my usage changed over this time. When I've turned them on the motor runs and you hear loud clanging but there is no motion. Considering that each one of these suckers costs half a grand, they aren't the cheapest things to replace and in this economy I can't afford to do so anymore. If they were still producing the quality product that they did a few years ago I would recommend it. As it is, I'd recommend that you spend your money on something built to last."
5,Title,This is a good product. Very strong massage action to sooth tense muscles. I would highly recommend it. It arrived on time and in good condition.
5,Good for what ails you,Exactly what everyone woman needs in her bedstand table. Could possibly be mistaken for muscle massager but do not be fooled! It is good for what ails you
1,Don't order--Not in stock,"Don't order from this company. They claim to have this item in stock and can ship on schedule, but they don't and blame the manufacturer. Avoid."
1,If you are looking for the best for your money,"I just got my New ""Flex Targeted Massager"" by Brookstone. Only took a couple of days to receive. The other people that are giving reviews here have NEVER had one of THESE units!!! It's electric, so Never wears down, got 4 different speeds & WILL DELIEVER!!! I'm SO happy I listened to Other peoples reviews before I bought. You CAN'T go wrong with this one.One thing to keep in mind when buying this unit is that it is electric, but does have an Extra Long cord. Also heavier then I thought, but that was Quickly overcome!! It's Solid, Not a cheapy. It WILL get to those places that have been neglected, For Sure!! Really Can't say enough...Happy shopping ~pen n ink"
5,The Best,"Don't waste your money on anything else!!! This is the best ""massager"" out there, my wife loves it. If you don't have one your missing out."
5,"Lasted 2 1/2 years of heavy use, power cord finally broke and shocked me","After 2 1/2 years of heavy use, the power cord finally came loose from the base, shocking me unexpectedly in the armpit :(. I am surprised it lasted as long as it did though - it outlasted all my other things, and it got a fair amount of abuse, including being pulled by the power cord and or tossed around more than once. Bought another one immediately, and I will be more careful with the power cord this time :D."
4,Wickedly Powerful,This could use a lower setting for warming up. Best for use during the act as opposed to before. Extremely effective and guaranteed to get some good screams!
3,"Great for sore muscles, much to intense for anything else","When the Magic Wand arrived I was surprised at how large it was. It looks like a giant microphone. I tried it on my neck and shoulders, and it actually felt great. Most massagers aren't strong enough to really help, but this one was. Having said that, it was much too strong to use on any other area of the body, if you know what I mean. The vibration was irritating to the skin, and much too intense to hold in one spot for longer than a few seconds. Also, if you put it on the tip of your nose while it's on, it will make you sneeze."
3,"Heavy, loud and akward, but gets the job done!","This product is heavy, heavier than what I anticipated. Also its as loud as a lawnmower. ( Okay, maybe not that loud!) It looks like something directly out of the 70's and 80's which, let's face it: it is. It is akward to use because of its weight and length. I thought that it would be fun to use with my boyfriend but he looks at it like it some sort of leftover spaceshuttle debris. It is very intense which I thought that I would really like, but after awhile the sensitive areas, well they just start to go numb. Don't get me wrong, it does do the job, just not in a very sexy, or quiet way!"
5,Great all around!,"I have to admit, I'm really happy with this purchase. At first with the box it seemed a little old like the design hasn't been changed in some time. But don't let that bother you as it was simply amazing!First off, it helps with tough knots. Not a bad massager really at all. I used it on my shoulders and upper back and a few random spots after working out or long days.Secondly, it's great for what we all know you others do with it! My girlfriend loved it. Very powerful which is a must! It drives her mad! (in a good way of course!)The best part are the attachments. I'd check out the trinity attachment for the g-spot.Worth what you are paying and some!Only downside is a short cord which isn't that bad."
2,Gets TOO hot!!!!,"I am on a medication that numbs my nerves, which is good for nerve pain but makes orgasm almost impossible. This wand can work sometimes, but often gets WAY TOO HOT before I can orgasm. Keep in mind, it takes me a long time because of my medication. If I did not take this medicine, I'm sure I could finish within 10 to 15 minutes, before it gets too hot. I have actually burned my skin with this thing! If you orgasm easily, this is awesome, but if it takes a while, find something else. I will say that with the attachments and my lover's assistance, I can reach orgasm very quickly...sadly, my lover isn't always there. Really, don't buy this if it takes you a while, it gets EXTREMELY HOT. The score of 2 stars is stricly for me and my situation...it just isn't what I hoped."
2,sad and disappointed,The old version of this product had a much higher speed and vibration...also this product was guaranteed to be shipped free of charge I would like for the UPS charge to be refunded to my credit card... Thanx Kane
1,Poorly Engineered,Quite simply...metal parts and soft pliable plastic do not mix. The quick mount for attachments to the head is interfaced with metal parts. This tears formed upon first use. Seek other alternatives and save the cost of the experience.
1,Waste of time,"Waste of time only the smallest attachment worked at all for me all the rest of them just fell off. One isn't even an attachments it's the thing you attach the attachments to. That is pointless by itself. FYI the hetachi is way too powerful for most women its okay with extra $30 speed control. It's an actually massager, its heavy duty and huge. Just FYI if you want to spend the 80$"
4,Very good buy - Very strong vibration,"I purchased a cheap one until this one arrived and the other one was not strong enough. This one is definitely a great buy for the money - so strong, I often use the lower vibration level."
3,Sweet Valley Sports!,"Twins Jessica and Elizabeth are interested in playing basketball,but when they start up a girls team,the boys are less than impressed,and act like a girls team is no big deal.So when the boys diss the girl's matches,the girls' cheerleading team refuses to cheer at the boys games,until the boys realize that they need the cheerleaaders.The girl's promise to cheer,only one condition.Look at the cover..can you guess what it is?!(giggle)"
5,It works,It keeps my new rug from moving around on the tiled entryway. Since that is it's purpose I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,non--slip,The ultra stop non-slip rug pad works. This pad will hold everything in place when you slide on the carpet. I say a good buy.
4,A good overview,"I've owned every one of Lee's albums for going on 30 years now - even the HORRIBLE ""Space and First Takes"" album. His first 5 were great - each in it's own way. No two were the same, and reflected the attitude that Lee had at the moment. sometimes he wanted to craft a song, sometimes he just laid 'em down.I also picked up this collection before the individual albums became available (now I have them, too). While it doesn't have all of my favorites, it does have a lot of them. If you want to hear the development of a decent writer, great keyboardist and vocalist, this would be a good choice.Give it a listen and trip back to the late 60's."
1,Deeply flawed grinder not worth the hassle,"This grinder is a piece of junk. Stainless exterior looks nice, but the rest is chintzy-feeling plastic. While grinding, makes an unappealing uneven noise. Worse, even when the hopper is mostly full, sometimes the beans stop falling through and the motor goes into a high whine. You have to bang the side to jostle beans to fall back into the chute, and by that time, you aren't ending up with your usual amount of grounds. Finally, the grounds fall not only into the cheap plastic container, but all over the exterior of it too! This means ground coffee gets all over your counter, no matter what. Every single time you remove the container of ground coffee, it strews some on your counter. Adding insult to injury, my motor broke after only four months. But I haven't gotten around to dealing with trying to get warranty service yet, since I am not really sure I even want this junky thing anymore. Don't buy it!"
1,"Clogs, Clogs, Clogs!!!","Pros: Looks great on countertop. Grinds evenly. Creates wonderful aroma.Cons: Tremendous static, grinds go everywhere (& I live in high humidity climate). Clogs, Clogs, Clogs!!! When it's not completely clogging, it semi-clogs during a grind and over-revs. LOUD-wakes up the entire house. Customer Service staff is snooty."
2,Terrible picture quality! Where's the screen?,"For around $60, you can get a much better camera that's at least 2 MP. Add $40 more and you can get a 3 MP with 3.5"" TFT 240x320 screen. This is NOT worth the money."
4,An interesting turn from his paintings of flowers,"I must say I thought the ""figure"" was charming. But what interested me most was the rich use of color and texture and the details. The text helps the reader understand what (s)he is seeing. I had hoped for more paintings and accompanying text in the book (a larger book)."
2,Good idea- bad implementation,"When I picked up this book, I had no programming experience at all. Now 3 years later, I have successfully learned C and VBScript.Feeling confident, I picked this book up again in the hopes that I could learn C++ before I had to take C++ in the fall at school (University of Michigan).I don't reccomend this at all.The author commits 2 mortal sins. The first is that he doesn't take the time to explain key programming concepts in depth. This could be a huge source of confusion to a newbie.The second is that he doesn't comment the book's code and there are frequent errors which left me wondering what I was coding. I dropped this book after the 7th chapter. Save yourself a headache and money and avoid this like the bubonic plague."
3,2 Old 2 B Relevant,"Murphy's ""Out of the Fog"" was published in 1995 -- that's 11 years behind the times! While he might include some informative and interesting stuff here, ADD/ADHD research is piling up with new insights and implications for personal and social-political use.The very best new work out there, as of 2006, is Thomas E. Brown's ""Attention Deficit Disorder: The Unfocused Mind in Children and Adults."" Brown, a psychiatry prof at Yale's School of Medicine and the associate director of the Yale Clinic for Attention and Related Disorders, hasn't written a self-help guide here; instead, he's crafted the best overview of current thinking about ADD. He answers doubters -- and, refreshingly, discusses why a number of doubts about the very existence of ADD exist.If you really want to know about ADD, this is the book."
2,not very helpful,"This had a lot of basic information on ADD, but it wasnt very interesting. It didn't offer a lot of practical help either. Most of what was in it I already knew. I don't recommend this book."
5,Unusual true stories about ships,"I really enjoyed the author's unique stories of similar, but extraordinary sea experiences. The unusual tales of over 200 ships are grouped under 20 separate chapters. There are tales of mystery ships, mutinies, animal antics, piracy, phenomena of the unknown and more in these highly readable short stories. I was given this book by a colleague only to find that I am captivated by a world about which I knew nothing."
1,A Waste of Money!,I love to hear bagpipes....am a BIG fan. This was a BIG disappointment! Save your money.
4,Vibratex Rabbit Dancer Vibrator,"this itme is very good to massage your head, face and neck, highly recommend for an office worker or anyone who sits in front of a computer a lot. so actually it is a very good gentle massager....but for other purposes (especially as the ""vibrator"" one is looking for), it's less effective."
2,"SAME OLD, SAME OLD","I had high hopes for this one, but...what can I say, it just didn't measure up. I have nothing truly against this book, but I felt as if I was re-reading McKenna's previous books. The plot was a little different, but not by much. I also felt as if the problems that the couple's history revealed were resolved much too quickly, as usual. I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this book wholeheartedly. It isn't a bad read,in fact, it's entertaining. But, it's just not a keeper in my opinion."
1,TALK ABOUT REPETATIVE!,"THE UNTAMED HUNTER IS THE FOURTH BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT THE HUNTER BROTHERS IN THE MORGAN'S MERCENARIES SERIES. IT WAS ALSO JUST ANOTHER REPEAT OF THE OTHER THREE BOOKS. BLACK DAWN IS UP TO SOMETHING AND A HUNTER BROTHER COMES TO THE RESCUE WITH THE HELP OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. THE ONLY DIFFERENT THING WAS THE PUBLISHER LINE, DESIRE. THANK GOODNESS THERE AREN'T ANY HUNTER BROTHERS LEFT OR WE'D BE GETTING ANOTHER RERUN!LINDSAY, I DO LIKE SOME OF YOUR WORK, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. FIND SOMETHING NEW TO WRITE ABOUT. PLEASE!"
5,Quality at a reasonable price,"After struggling with a cheap Radio Shack analog multimeter, I bit the bullet and purchased this Fluke for working on guitar amplifiers. What a world of difference! A good user's manual accompanies the product and it is very intuitive to use. It's given me new confidence in taking measurements as I work. Sturdy rotary dial with positive detents. A tool to keep for life."
1,Leaks very badly,"This hose leaked a lot once I hooked it up. I thought it was me, so I had a man hook it up thinking I did something wrong, and it still leaked. We tried hooking it up multiple times, but no matter what we did it would spray out where we connected it to the spicket. Realized it was not worth the money I paid for it because the hose is not a good quality and the one I currently have is better, so boxed it up and returned it."
5,"Very beautiful watch, very accurate and precise.","Note: I bought this watch at a Kohl's store. However, I felt it would be useful to leave a review on Amazon.)When I first saw this watch behind the glass display shelf, it really grabbed my attention. I knew it was the watch for me when I put it on my wrist. The dial and the face on this watch is absolutely, stunningly, beautiful. It has a 10-second timer, 1-minute timer, and a 30-minute timer. The genuine leather band is very comfortable, easy to put on and take off, and is adjustable to fit any wrist. The black leather with white stitching is also very nice looking. However, my favorite part of this watch is that it's made entirely of stainless-steel, very durable. I also love the design of the dial itself. Also, the crown is very comfortable to use when setting the date and time. The watch hands glow in the dark too. I am proud to say that this is the most beautiful watch i've ever owned. I am very pleased with it."
2,Too heavy,"Generally I am a huge fan of Wenger watches - I like their fine design and their reliability, but this one is too heavy. It is just uncomfortable to wear. Check out the TerraGraphs - much more comfortable to wear."
3,Well... interesting,"this is an interesting one. I received the wrong book in my order, oddly enough a book I'd been looking for and had forgotten the name. I received Love Enough For Two by Cynthia Rutledge, I can't wait to read it but now need to reorder Love Comes Home which I will because it looks wonderful."
1,Cliches in motion,"--Barechested man wearing a tie walks across the stage with generically loud 'latino' muzak in the background-""Wow, how original. Hey a tie and no shirt!"" If this is your response to such a scene then this film may be for you. It depends on whether you mind watching people dance on dimly lit stages or enveloped by mists or obscured by some guy singing into a microphone a song that is musical only in the sense that there is a blaring orchestra in the background. If you are looking for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers look someplace else. If you are looking for the opportunity to watch 20 people disco dancing at the same time to disco music you will enjoy the performances who share the dance floors at the same time and successfully avoid banging into each other."
1,Extremely poor interface,"I had a Garmin Ique 3600 Palm OS PDA GPS which unfortunately decided to stop working with the car cradle before our move to CA. I bought this Sony GPS as a replacement. The Garmin had a much better interface. The Sony interface is extremely poor and takes an excessive amount of time to find things. For example, if you want to look for a certain store you have to search by city, not by nearest one (unless you have a GPS feed, which hinders you before you leave your house). Also, the map data is suspect as it lead me to the wrong location a couple of times. The only thing I like about it over my Garmin is it acquires the GPS signal much faster. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone. Stick to a company which just does GPS and mapping such as Garmin or Magellan. Whomever Sony subcontracted to do the software for this device is obviously new to car navgiation."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!,"This has been the most boring anime ever. For action lovers:Alot of talk no action, For sexy lovers: Not on this anime, For gore/blood/cursing/ lovers: nope, not NOIR. Do not recommend this crappy anime."
1,trouble from the start,"From the beginning I had connection issues with the hardware and software - my system hanging on me for no good reason. On a couple of occasions I had to reformat the player, but found that even that was difficult to do (worked on WinXP but not on Win2k). Maybe used it 10-15 times total over the past year because it's been so difficult.So tonight I decided enough was enough - I downloaded the latest driver and firmware and installed (or tried to). The thing hung (once again) in the middle of installation and now is completely dead. No light goes on, no device recognition on my computer... just dead. And conveniently, of course, 3 weeks after the warranty expired.Creative Labs just lost a long-time customer."
2,flimsy,"I have this player for a couple of months now, and also at first I liked it, now when I compare it with my old MD player I see it's not as goodI guess it's main problem is rather poor design:- It takes a while to steer to a directory / folder using the scroll wheel. You have to constantly check your progress on the LCD Try to do it while jogging - you're garanteed to bump into someting.- Speaking of the LCD, the plastic cover over it have cracked within two months. I didn't drop or misused the player but of course wasn't able to convince the Creative warranty service to replace it. Again, my previous player was much sturdier.- Because of the way the on/off button is located it happened many times that the player would turn on while in my purse, draining the battery. Also, if you try to remove the USB unit from the player unit you end up turning the player on.Summary - buy something sturdier if you plan to use your player every day"
4,"Poodles and Ostriches and Sheep, Oh My.","Ostrich was a charming book. VJ and Ev, best friends with totally opposite views and energy levels, are such delightful characters. They play off one another in a way that lets the reader get to know them thoroughly. Sabine and Magda, husband and wife, interact in a truely remarkable and heart-warming way, giving and taking, balancing stubbornness with love. Their three daughters, especially Rosa, are well-drawn and vital characters. And the Colonel, he's a very funny piece of work. Put these interesting characters, and their relationships, into a mix of animals including donkeys, poodles, sheep, and a hair-raising baby ostrich and you'll find as much delight as I did. Michael Thomas has a winner here."
4,A good little hygrometer,I use the word little because it is small maybe 2 inches in diameter but it seems to work as well is another one I have although I have no idea how to adjust it as there were no instruction shipped with the hygrometer. All in all it is plus or -3% and that works for me.
1,It is the wrong item.,"The item pictured is a small hygrometer for a humidor.I ordered the 2.25"" Western Humidor, also a white faced hygrometer with a dial, but clearly bigger than the small hygrometer.I filled out the return form and sent the small hygrometer back to you.You sent me the small hygrometer back."
3,Seems to work fine.,"I have never calibrated this against a hygrometer that a scientist would use, but I did buy two, and they both read the same level when placed in the same humidor. Although that does not proove that the reading is correct, it does say that relative to each other they match. For me, for the price they work just fine and I have no complaints."
1,Don't buy for a larger Humidor!,"So after several positive reviews, I ordered this as a replacement one for my 250 stick humidor. It arrived fairly quick, I pulled it out of the box to see this little hygrometer that is way too small to use a replacement for my humidor. Had the proper dimensions been listed on the page (the photos make it look larger than it really is) I would have known that it would not work. No point in returning it since I am already out the shipping. I guess I might try to use it in my travel humidor. Disappointed to say the least."
1,junk,broken. will only move about 5% points in any direction...tried a few different ways to calibrate. not even worth shipping back to amazon for a refund...just count it as a loss.
1,Poorly manufactured,"Hello. This item is very poorly manufactured, when it got home the glass was broken, do not buy this item if you don't want waste your money"
4,Good to have!,"Im glad I bought this, the buttons are large and light up so you know what lights are on and off, there is a slight delay tho when you turn on the switch but besides that this is a great little power switcher for anyone that has a good light collection, but doesn't really want to spend a ton of money buying a DMX controller. All in all a great buy and really cheep!"
5,Works Great - Excellent Price,"I got this to control my computer modem, router, and internet phone. I got tired of unplugging them to reset them. This works great, all the plugs fit and this was by far the least expensive set of switches i could find."
1,Overpriced,"Cheaply made, can by better at Walmart for 1/2 price. Shipping cost was way too high. Should have sent parcel post."
3,They melt...,"I enjoyed these tools for quite some time. And then one day I notice that the plastic/rubber coatings started to melt and the metal began showing. Based on the price your not really buying top quality, but I wouldn't expect to start finding little bits of melted rubber/plastic in my food. Granted they aren't big chunks, but it still isn't very appetizing. I spent a little extra money and bought the Calphlon tools and they're ten times the tools these are. My advice, spend a little extra for the good stuff and not settle for these."
2,Defective lot or what?,"We got one of these for our 2 year old. She can't put the people on it either! We returned the first one because the trapese didn't stay up. Now the second one is the same way :(Not impressed with this one. I love the A to Z zoo, buy that one instead!"
3,Not suitable for age listed,"My daughter received this for her first birthday and it has caused several injuries to her. The item is large with 2 hinged sections and when she tries to carry it by the built in-handle, she trips and falls on it. It seems like the edges are too sharp and I find the metal tight rope wire too hazardous for her. The item doesn't weigh much, it's just too bulky and awkward for a child that young. She is now 16 months old and I finally put it away for when she's at least 2. I'm sure once she's older this will be a fine toy for her."
1,Very poor durability,I bought this battery in October 2008. By June 2009 it would only hold a charge for 10 minutes.Do Not Buy.
5,it works,It works with my Dell Inspiron 9300. bought this in 2007 and it still works.not much else to say about a battery.
2,Bose FS-1 Bookshelf Speaker Floor Stands,"They're easy to assemble; however, the screws kept getting stripped as I was anchoring the plates and one of the screws got stuck so tight, I couldn't get the screw all the way down flat on the plate. Speakers look nice on the stands, but the quality is not that great for the price."
1,thanks for nothing and a no star rating if possible,"I would just like to thank amazon for providing absolutely no content information for this DVD. for all I know it could be filled with ""Coach"" reruns. would it kill them to provide a track listing? I mean this is a U.S. release and not some German import. the link they suggest for ""more information on this product"" is useless. needless to say, amazon has made it way too much work to buy this product from them. Perhaps Boarders.com may be more informative."
4,takes some getting used to,"I was a little intimidated by the curve, but find that I like the attachment more than using the wand without it. It took some getting used to and some practice :-) getting the right angle to hit just the right spot, but I am happy with the purchase. Not too hard, and not too soft."
4,It works,Being new to the Magic Wand it took some practice and a dimmer switch to get a setting I liked. Now it does the job.
3,Great idea,"Works so-so, but it really needs to be more rigid. I expected it to be solid, but it is actually hallow inside and if you have any kind of muscle tone there, it just bends instead of applying pressure where it needs to."
4,Barron's French Grammar,"If you are looking to learn the technical aspect of French, then this book is for you. I bought the Italian version and I have a better understanding of sentence structure after reading through it."
5,Reusable Bedpads,I use these for my pet Yorkie and they are PERFECT. They are nice and large and super absorbent.
1,Shrinking Bed Pads,"These items are thinner than similar ones I've had in the past. They seemed good enough at first tho, so I kept them. I washed them and once washed however, they completely shrunk quite drastically. They also are so thin, so they curl up on all the ends and no longer lay flat. They are just for the floor where I house my aging dog for when he has an accident, so they will be good enough for this purpose I hope. He has not peed on them yet, so I can't comment on the absorbency level. Hopefully nothing goes through.UPDATEA few months later he has peed on them several times. They are lousy. You don't get a puddle on the other side, but you do get dampness bleeding through. Not worth the money. Tried to return them once I saw they didn't work as planned, but the company refused a refund. Yes, I was past the 30 day period, but still. Stand behind your product regardless, especially if someone says they hadn't used them yet."
5,Amazing for my little leaker!,I'm a nurse and we use these in hospitals so I could have kicked myself for not buying one sooner. I have a toddler who is not quite night trained and leaks through his pull up so the sheets and mattress get wet. This product is a lifesaver. It truly keeps all the bed linens dry and clean. I am going to purchase a couple of more so I can rotate them. These are great for anyone that has kids or an adult with an incontinence issue.
3,Really -- is this as good as it gets?,"My child was wetting every night and I was using this product.It didn't stop his bedwetting (another product did), but this is an expensive solution that is temporary. It kept the urine smell out, but I really think it is overpriced."
4,Great Product,"These are a great product, perfect for toddlers learning not to wet their beds.However, you should try not to put them in the dryer too often.They start to curl after too many repeated drying sessions.But COMPLETELY washer machine compatible."
3,It's ok,"I got this for my 2,5 year old, but he is not a calm sleeper and the pad is always ""moving"" with my son throughout the whole bed; also when being washed takes wayyyy to long for it to dry"
4,Works great,Had purchased a similar product before but this was larger. The flaps really do keep it in place. I only needed one flap so cut off one and put it on my older pat and now that works better too! Never have an accident with this product.
5,Excellent product!,"I purchased three of these as puppy pads for two dachshunds. They are wonderful and I only had to change one time per day vs disposable pads that needed to be change two or more times per day. These pads do not leak and have endured well after numerous machine washings. Environmentally friendly in that they are reusable. Cost very affordable with free shipping. If I ever wear these out, I will buy more!"
3,Not what was advertised,I ordered the Blue- Max Bed pads however this is not what i recieved I recieved the Inva Care Bed Pads. They are a cheaper made product. I ordered them for my son who still occasionally has bed wetting problems. I've been in the nursing field for over 10 yrs and I know the difference between cheaper made products and the good ones which is the whole reason I ordered the Blue- Max ones. Shipping was ok however I never did recieve exact tracking information for the order. Will probably not do business with this seller again. I feel if you are going to advertise something then that is exactly what you should be shipping to your customers.
3,Works ok and washes up nice but hard to keep in place in a full size bed,Works well but hard to keep in place in a full size bed. Tried to pin down the corners but during movement in sleep the safety pins come open.
3,Not as expected,"These are a little larger than I expected-GOODThese are not as soft and clothy as expected-OKAYThese sort of shift more-NOT GOODThese have not been wet, yet-PRICELESS"
3,It works well but...,It slides all over the place. The bottom is slippery type plastic so if they move a lot in there sleep it doesn't stay under them. You can probably fix it with some tape I guess. I'm not saying it flys around either. Just that the 3 times we had a accident they missed some of it because they had moved it enough in their sleep. These would be better for sound sleepers or perhaps get a really huge one.Though the pee that hits it. Definitely will NOT go through and it's dry by morning so they don't get a rash. It also washes very well.I'd give it a five star if they had some type of anything really to prevent it from sliding around like a slip in slide.
4,It was about time!,I should have bought this a while back. And then I would have avoided changing sheets every night for my toddler.
4,Great for the money!,"This was a great buy. The pads are nice. Just remember they only soak 800ml. So not for heavy bedwetters. They are just the right size. My daughter doesn't like the bigger ones, they are too hot at night she says. These are perfect. We got 3 and are getting a few more. They are blue and white not white on white like the company said. Fast delivery."
5,Large and substantial for great coverage and bed protection,Mom is not bariatric but these were a good size and very glad I ordered them. They cover over the edges of a twin mattress and from shoulder to ankles to really protect a good area. Thicker and a little stiffer than some of the others too so stay in place and absorb well. Don't shrink or ball up in hot water and drier. Have used other sizes before and they needed velcro or 2-3 pads before did the job and stayed in place.
5,GReat,Sturdy hard plastic. Great product. Mounted to a milk crate with zip ties.You can also use rod tubes individualy if you don't need center bracket.
1,Be aware that this is not the HC 16,"As one poster said, I agree this is not an authentic HC 16 filter. I went up to my attic and looked at my filter, and sure enough this is white on both sides of the filter. The authentic HC 16 will be darker because it actually contains it contains Carbon Charcoal to filter the odors.AMAZON, please consider looking into this as I believe this item listed by this retailer is misleading. Thank you."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I had a similar problem as a previous reviewer: my rechargeable battery petered out a few DAYS after the warranty ran out. Luckily, after a ridiculous dance with customer service, they sent me another one. Within a year, the new one would not hold a charge either.The pictures are really not very good - they're actually worse than my camera phone! The camera on its own holds very few pictures (like, 28 or something), and the flash is a cartridge-type thing that snaps on the camera. Only the camera fits in the case, so you have to find something to do with the flash.Unlike the previous reviewer, my camera did NOT cost $30 - it was more when I purchased it - but even at $30, it is not a good buy. If your kid wants a camera, buy them a kiddie digicam. If you're looking for something inexpensive, surely there are better choices out there!"
3,Not bad..,"Not bad, but not great either. It's a decent product, but better exist. I highly doubt if I would ever buy this again."
3,i wanted to love it,"really, i wanted to, but i just couldn't. when my baby q was stolen off my porch i didn't even shed a tear. here's why. because of the vents on the side, this grill does not work well for slow coooking bbq. for grilling its fine. however if you are the kind of bbq cook that likes to slow cook pork shoulders or brisket (you know, bbq), this is not the grill for you. if you are a griller, its sufficient. so, 3 stars for me. for you it might be 5the goodthe grill marks meat beautifully.it stinks of high quality.so, so, so easy to use.the badjust doesn't work that well for bbq due to excessive ventingthe uglygoes through gas canisters quickly, so you gotta buy the adapter to use bulk tanks.people can easily walk off with it, so you gotta lock it up or bring it in."
1,You can't buy the propane bottles,"I went to Home Depot, Lowes and Walmart. They do not carry the 14.1 Oz propane bottles for this grill. Why did Weber design a grill if the propane bottles are so hard to find? Very frustrating!Now I have to buy the adapter for the larger bottles. I may as well have purchased a full sized grill."
5,Dont lisen to negative.,This grill is the best ever. It is not to heavy but it is big. The food cooks evenly. The stand is sturdy and the drip pans are another plus. My only complaint which does not really count is the size of the propane tankes. They are small but last enough for me. But they are so cheap that thats even another plus.
4,"Good, but","I found this book good for my exam revisions. All the practise questions were useful as well. The format of this book is excellent, and Exam tips and traps are very helpful. And the section where they reverse-engineer several practise questions is excellent, as it show how the tests are made, and what the commonly used ""confusers"" are.However, I must add a "", but"". The book misses some of the things you must know for the exam. Even worse are the errors in this book. There are several errors that should have been spotted by the author and the technical advisors.I like the format of this book, but it does miss out on some things, and there are errors in the book. A good alternative to this book is the Sybex ""MCSE exam notes"" series."
1,"Great idea: but no instructions, so completely useless.","We live in the UK, and sent this construction toy to our 5 year old grandson in New York as it claimed to allow 40 different modesl to be built: like the Meccano system of the 1940's. They have just called to say how disappointing it is as there are no instructions included, and it is really quite complex. What a let down, and we dont know how to get the instructions either. [...]Or perhaps this product isnt meant to have instructions!Very disappointed grandparents and grandson."
2,Good for Quoting,"The book is an excellent source for quoting. I love to send small bits of it around the office, to make me look wiese.Besides from this, it contains only old software wisdom. Nothing new and no added value. So, if you read several books about software development, you will allready know the contents of this one."
4,"Must-read, but take it with a grain of salf","Author does a very good job at debunking common myths of software development, especially those most popular with people not involved in development process directly. However, his attitude towards opponents and lack of objectivity in the fact base render his account somewhat less persuasive than it, in my opinion, could be. I would still recommend this book to any project manager of customer willing to improve their understanding of software development. There are not too many books that do a decent job at it and are short enough."
5,quality product,The quality of the hat was better than expected and the quick shiping was quick and tracking was much appreciated. Jim
5,Best Cocoa to use,Dutch Process is the best Cocoa powder to use in any form of baking or if you just want a killer hot chocolate.
4,"dark, rich, excellent","I bought this because I can't find any cocoa other than Hershey's or something sugar-laden--in Los Angeles, mind you.As soon as I opened the package, I was in heaven. It's just got an amazing aroma.And I've only used it to make hot cocoa, but it's terrific."
1,Disappointing!,"I thought this would have been a great toy for my 4 year old son, who loves to build things, but because of poor construction, it's difficult to use. The threads on the blocks are so tight, that it's hard, even for me, to screw the screws in. The screwdriver chipped almost immediately, because of the force required to turn the screws, and another screw snapped inside a block because we were unable to turn it without using a low of force."
5,Easy but Varied,You have five different programs to pick from. None are the traditional floor style ab routine. Gives you newer moves and impliments pilates and sqeezes in there.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"After completing the entire program, I felt like it wasn't enough. Although some segments, such as the 6 pack, were good I didn't feel challenged."
2,Alot of core work,"Five workouts that are more core work (so it wont just be your abs burning) with only one workout that is more crunches than anything else. I guess it's just me, but I really didn't like this instructor - spastic body jesters and her mouth is smiling but her eyes aren't."
2,average video,This video was okay and I liked the 10 minute idea but unfortunatly it started off with some very difficult exercises that only the best fit people could do. So skip them right??? Yeah then feel guilty every time you start the cd and have to go to the next set. Getting fit is in the mind as well as the body and that's not the best way to try and get fit by starting out feeling like you're inadequate.
2,Not what I expected,"Concept is good, but execution is weak. For someone who is not use to following a video I need instructors to slow down and explain what is about to happen or demo first. These 10 Min Solutions don't do that. Makes it hard to enjoy and use."
4,Segments,Always enjoy 10 minute segment exercises because you can fit them in your schedule / easy to follow instructions /Use it on my alternating days I don't go to the Gym
5,Ouch (but a good ouch),"I had two babies within 2 years so even sans baby weight my abs pretty much waved the white flag of surrender. I decided to buy this DVD to add to my arsenal of nap time workouts to do when we can't go for a run with the stroller (excuses include: its too hot, it is raining, and it is a day ending in ""y""). Since Amazon included a 2 day rental until the actual DVD came, I decided to do a couple of segments to dip my big toe in. Alas, this workout became addicting and I managed to work my way through all 5 workouts at once. The good news is that I definitely feel like I've worked out stomach muscles that I haven't seen this side of 2009, the bad news is that I may have to have my husband help me tie my running shoes tomorrow morning because I'm going to be epic amounts of sore. I really enjoyed the instructor even though I definitely have ab jealousy. The 10 Minute solutions are always great to fit in to a schedule around kids and I'm glad I bought this one as well."
5,Great Ab workout,"Just got this video and tried it for the first time. I really like that the workouts were in 10 minute segments. You can do one, two, etc. In all there are 5 workouts on the video. I will try to post a follow up review in a few weeks to update how effective the workout was in flattening my abs!"
1,Boring book that tries too hard,"This book tried too hard to emulate the humor and pathos of ""The House Of God"". Unfortunately it has neither. I rarely put down a book before I finish it but this was one I could not complete. Boring"
5,"More Hilarity at ""Mount Misery""","""Mount Misery"" was a facility to which unruly spouses and progeny might be constrained pending divorce or other life shaping proceedings. All too true, and, after all these years, I finally figured out that Schlomo was Freud's middle name."
1,diappointed,"I purchased 2 of these for my kids.I thought the price was reasonable and that my kids could keep their money and special items in them.But,the lock on one of them doesn't work and on the other one,the latch broke.I thought about returning them but,between time and money,I decided against it.I guess,maybe the price was too reasonable.You get what you pay for."
5,Best one from Author,"This book is still the best one from the author. It does something no other book has done in yes. It creates a mystery leave the reader wanting more. Since I've read this book, no other story line (involving time travel) exist. I'll happily read more books that involve time travel or a period piece with a black women and white man. But they are rare. This book sets the stage that I was hope others would follow. No such luck."
5,Fun learning experience for preschoolers!,"I bought this game for my almost 4 year old daughter that is just starting to learn her letters. After playing just a few games, she was recognizing letters that she didn't know before. Even my 11 year old son enjoyed playing and teaching his sister her ABCs. They both enjoyed yelling out ""BINGO"" when their cards were full. No need for a ""winner"" (Losing can be particularly devasting to my preschooler)...we just kept pulling the alphabet cards, so everyone could win! Fun and educational."
1,Moving Up?,"UNFORTUNATELY I bought this book on a whim. The subject matter AND the book jacket reminded me of the mill village that I lived in as a child in North Carolina. Both of my parents' families were textile mill workers during (and after) the Great Depression. I found the prose to be poorly crafted and the book to be poorly edited--if it was edited at all. If you are looking for the experience of living in a mill village, this book is not going to invoke that feeling. It will only leave you feeling frustrated."
1,"Poor Product, Poor Support","I experienced two significant flaws in this product, (1) the background noise with the backlight, and (2) most importantly, the unit keeps shutting down as soon as I try to turn it on. The first problem was annoying, but controllable by never using the backlight, but the second means I have an unusable mp3 player. I bought this in January 2005 and by October my money was effectively wasted, with Amazon unwilling to deal with this problem and Creative only suggesting downloads (which didn't work) or sending the product back (with onerous conditions, ie having to pay US$30 just to have them look at their own unit). I would not buy another Creative unit, nor recommend it to anyone else. Extremely disappointed."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this one after buying my wife the 512MB version. Both of ours started having problems. We've reformatted them twice already and mine has started shutting off whenever I try to record from FM. They are terrible ar killing batteries. A brand new Duracell will only last a week with listening for 2-3 hours a day and it drains the battery in 2 weeks even when it has been turned off and inactive. I use mine mainly now as a portable storage device to keep computer files on it, an expensive price to pay for a flash drive."
4,Nice Compact Unit easy to use.....,"I bought the MuVo N200 1GB unit and I love it. The sound is excellent and the size is even better. It is easy to use and holds about 265 songs. I have not had any problems at all and use it constantly. I also highly recommend buying the Sony Fontopia ear plugs. They make a huge difference.The only negative is that I wish it had higher volume. I use it when I ride on my motorcycle and it can be hard to hear, but that is my problem.Overall, I highly recommend!"
3,You Get What You Pay For,"Fair price for this fire retardant box. You get what you pay for. No problem with the lock but there are several dents on the side and on the corners. Buyer beware. This dents are from the factory and not from Amazon. These boxes are tossed and banged around at the assembly line. I'm afraid if I return it to Amazon, I will get another one that is also dented, perhaps worse, so I decided to keep it. If you don't mind the blemishes, it is fully functional at a fair price."
1,Better ones out there,"This map has pocketable size going for it, but that's about it.There are 2 sides to it: One has the greater LA area, but isn't really detailed enough to be useful for navigating anywhere other than city to city (only major highways are marked). The other side has a detail of downtown - but who roams around downtown LA?I think the ""Popout"" one is better, and equally pocketable."
4,Good radio,"My husband uses it to hook his portable MP3/CD player to. The sond is really good, although the radio part is weak and does not stay on the station well enough to listen to it for long before the occasional static gets to you. Luckily his CD player holds up to 400+ songs, so he does not use the radio often. But it's generally a nice little piece of equipment."
2,Ok,"Fit with standard equipment, did not have to modify dash on resto project so it did the job overall ok product"
3,Good for the price,Nice looking product. Easy to use. Vrey good price. Easy to install. Nothing better for a few dollars.
5,Micky Can Put Me to Sleep Anytime!,"I love this CD. I play it in my car when I want to relax and chill while driving. It really shows what a huge Beatles fan Micky is and his versions of their songs are wonderful. I especially love Beautiful Boy. My favorite song on the CD is St Judy's Comet. I had never heard it before and I just think it's a precious song. Micky's performance on the CD is excellent. I can't wait to play it and sing the songs for my grandchildren. (When I ever have any) Thanks for a great CD, Micky. I'm still a huge fan since 1966."
4,good file case,came as promised and is just what i needed..would order from this vendor again.have put it to use and it is perfect.
1,Key bent on initial turn! DO NOT BUY!,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. The 1st turn of the key bent it and jammed inside the lock. Upon inspection of the 2nd key, it was already bent! Spend a few more dollars and get something that works and isn't made from a desk."
5,Great Fun!,"My daughter loves this toy! She spends hours making designs and animals out of clay. Also, clean up is a snap with included wooden case!"
3,Okay!,I love the tools in this set but feel there was not enough playdoh included. My granddaughter had fun with toys but was looking for playdoh to roll.
5,love it.,Love this set! Whenever I break out the playdough this set HAS to come out too. My only complaint would be that on the handheld roller the dolly that holds the roller to the handle has fallen off a few times super glue has fixed that issue so it is no longer a issue.
4,very fun,"My 2 and 5 year old both enjoy this toy. We use homemade dough with it. We used to only have 1 roller, that the kids would fight over, so having 3 in this set is great! The blocks are fun too!"
4,Its all gud,"This was one of the Christmas gift for my 4 yrs old and he loves it. Good quality, decent price and delivery as promised. He is happy and so are we."
1,poorly made,"I just got this set a week ago and the roller is already broken. It is very poorly made and I would not recommend it. I would like to return it, but since it is broken I don't think I will be able to."
2,"love melissa and doug, disappointed with this product.","I'm sorry to report that this is a terrible set of playdough toys. one of the wooden stamping blocks broke within five minutes of my son playing normally with it. The dough was horrible but I didn't care about that. The rollers are not long enough to be of any use, the ""cutter"" is too chunky to cut, and the wooden stampers just get things stuck in them and since they are wood you can't really wash them. The rubber stampers are fun though. Needless to say, we were really disappointed."
4,like this,"These are well made, but you have to work at it to get the rolling pin imprints in the dough. My five year old lost interest quickly, but my older one liked it."
5,Great value !,"Once again, a Melissa and DOug toy that is really good value for money. SOme reviewers say the dough is no good. I don't know if the manufacturers have taken notice but I found it to be fine. A little soft if anything which can easily be remedied by leaving it out of the tubs for a while. My just two yr old loves it all and has plenty more exploring to do."
5,Game Cook Book,Have already used receipes from this book. It is everthing that I was expecting and the meals have turned out delicious!
2,Not worth it,"Seriously, invest in a backpack from LL Bean, which at least has a lifetime guarantee. This ""Ergonomic Backpack"" has straps that constantly twist and are impossible to straighten out, making it extremely uncomfortable and therefore, not-so ergonomic. Also, the zippers break pretty easily. I regret this purchase."
1,Current Picture is erroneous,"Picture is erroneous. it is not a picture of notebook memory, its too big. its a picture of desktop memory, hopefully amazon will correct the error"
2,PNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR 333 MHz PC2700 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory...,"Item: PNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR 333 MHz PC2700 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory...Did not work on my computer. Was installed by a professional computer service, but my PC Desk Top did not accept this memory."
4,It worked fine,"Although my HP notebook has both ""inside"" and ""outside"" SDRAM slots, I installed this DIMM myself. It fired right up and since installation (early January 2011), it's worked fine. Competitive price with ""used"" street item I looked for. Be sure you are looking for notebook RAM and not desktop RAM."
5,"good product, but Caveat Emptor....","Product is excellent. But Amazon has mis-labelled their stock (Desktop version has been labelled with Notebook code number). So order by phone and demand that Amazon guarantee to send MN1024, NOT MD1024. Amazon put their stock label OVER PNY's, so the only way to tell is by the picture on the front of the packaging - a Desktop or a Notebook image. Hopefully they will correct this before long."
5,"Fast shipping, product as described","I debated whether it was worth spending any money on my 10 year old win xp laptop that had 512 megs of ram. Adding the 1 GB stick, bringing the total to 1.256GB gave the laptop new life! No longer does the hard drive grind away for minutes when you open and close apps. If all you do is browse the web, and check email on a old slow laptop, this ram will extend the life of your computer for years."
2,Didn't work for my Dell Inspiron 8600,"I purchased 2 of 1 GB PNY DDR RAM to upgrade my Dell Inspiron 8600 personal laptop. One of them was good but when another I added laptop was not booting. Finally I figured out it is defective one. Thanks to Amazon wonderful customer service, got replacement next day itself. So far working fine now but surprised to get such defective item even though it is brand new one."
2,Not What I Thought,I liked the straight-forward writing style of the author but felt the title was misleading. It went downhill fast when the author states that if you want to make money you have to move to a few parts of the country where he thinks the antiques are. I don't know about you but I can't pack up and move to upstate New York or the rural area of Maine. (He stated there are no good antiques in the South since Sherman burned it down). This is basically a overview of the antiques business and how things are run. I don't agree with some of his list of things to buy and not to buy. It's an okay book and you can gleam a few gems out of it but I don't think you are going to double your money just by reading this book.
4,A Good Selection for Kids Who Like to Build,"Although he likes being able to build things and make motorized models with this kit, my 12yo son says he wishes this kit were more challenging. So far, he has made the dragster and motorcycle. He says he would recommend this kit to other kids."
4,Just Fun to Read,"I'm not as analytical as some (most?) when I read. I just start at the beginning, enjoy the trip (or not) and usually am surprised near the end. So my opinion may not carry as much weight.But I liked it. Of course he could have simplified it! It's as much character study as action story. But I enjoyed the characters, and how they got in each others way. The humor reminded me of Carl Hiasen (sp), Tim Dorsey or Tom Holt; twisted.I've since read several of his others and enjoyed them too."
3,Ok but no lust lizard,"Maybe this is my fault. I read lust lizard and then this one. I didn't like this one nearly as much as lust lizard. The characters were good. The story was interesting. But, something was missing. It just didn't keep me wanting more or wishing the story had continued. Instead I was kind of happy when it was over so that I could move on. Please don't get me wrong. It is good. But, after reading lust lizard I think I was expecting too much. During the reading of lust lizard I would openly laugh, but practical demonkeeping tried to be funny but never quiet hit it."
3,pretty good,"After reading Lamb I picked up some more of Moore's work- Lust Lizard and Practical Demonkeeping. Lust Lizard was the better of the two, very funny throughout. Practical demonkeeping was pretty good also."
3,Coin Tube sorter a passable solution,"I bought this a couple years ago and have used it a number of times. It is definitely better then counting by hand, and it actually goes fairly quickly. The accuracy of these are probably +/- 2 coins. This is not necessarily the fault of the tubes, but the fact that coins can vary in size with gunk, being bent, or being worn down. For the most the bank will recount it and make the adjustment, for which I don't know why they just don't take coins in the first place, and there is no way I'm paying the 8% for Coinstar to do it.Some coin wrappers work better than others, the product does not come with its own, but your bank should provide you with some.All in all, it speeds up the process, and is has enough accuracy to be a viable solution."
1,Innacurate counts on dimes and pennies,"As others have noted the variation in thicknesses amongst dimes and pennies makes it impossible to get a consistently accurate count by the height of a coin stack in one of these tubes. Believe me, I tried several strategies. It always seemed to be accurate for nickels and almost always for quarters. Unfortunately that's not accurate enough for the bank. After several tries with the coin tubes, and verifying the total by manually counting, I realized this tool was incapable of counting the value of coins in a jar.You can still use it to wrap coins in wrappers, but since many banks don't take them that way and will unpack them and recount them if they do, there's not really any purpose I can think of that is served by these plastic tubes."
5,"Excellent, well-put together, not too dumbed down or techie","Just loved this book. It covered everything, as in everything. If your knowledge or project is highly specialized, there may be parts you zip through, but this is an excellent read either cover to cover or to refer back to."
5,This book is an excellent tool to use in the classroom!,I am a fourth grade teacher and I have just completed this book. Tonight on the Titanic not only uses fantasy (treehouse going to another time) but throws a little history in with it (historical fantasy). I can't wait to begin my unit on famous ships and shipwrecks. Mary Pope Osborne also captures an element of suspense that children will love. Even I was worried that Jack and Annie would become trapped on the Titanic and never return home! This book will promote not only reading but encourage history as well. My advice to any primary educator is to become familiar with the Magic Tree House Series and use it in your daily curriculum!
3,My book report for Tonight on the Titanic,"Tonight on the Titanic vy Mary Pope Osborne.Tonight on the titanic is a very exiting book. It really is like the others but it has alot of different details and it has been a joy to read it and I hope I have a chance to read other ""magic tree house"" books and I hope they will be great.If you want to find out if annie and jack survive you will have to read this book and find out!!!"
1,Horrible!,"I bought this player for class, and it worked fine for the first two months. Then it just started acting up on me. At first I thought it was the batteries, but then I changed them and the thing still doesn't work. It can rewind and ff fine, but forget playing or recording...it only works for two seconds!"
5,"For kids that learn ""outside-the-lines""","I'm both a teacher and a parent and I must say that Pat Wyman knows kids and the learning system in this country. I know from my students in class as well as my own son that each child has a special gift they can offer. Unfortunately, schools make everyone march to the same beat. Pat Wyman does an excellent job of both describing how things are screwed up in schools and what we can do about it. If your child has his/her own way of looking at the world, you need to support it any way you can. You can learn how with this book. Do your child a favor and start learning."
1,Great Little radio,I have had this radio for about six weeks and I really like it. After really listenning to to world I got hooked and could not stop.Lots of great reception in a little package. Now that I am hooked this is my spare that I can keep in my desk at work and I have purchased the Eton E10 for home use. Shortwave is a great hobby.Ed
4,Durable and secure,This cash drawer is very smooth and very durably constructed!! It is unmatched compared to many top companies. But the plastic button wares down over time.
5,Nutraderm Therapeutic lotion,"My husband is a Dermatology PA, and has access to many products for use. This is his favorite lotion and he as been using it for 15 years. It is very difficult to find in Salt Lake and I was glad to find it through Amazon."
4,Let the playtime start,"This product was perfect and the price was a minimum $30 - $40 cheaper than in local stores (Yes, even after shipping!!). I do want to note that if your child already has a set then trying to intermix them will test your engineering degree or patience. The only thing stopping all five stars is that the elevated track corners routinely pop apart with 3-4 year old play. I also recommend that a play table be purchased and used. My child's table and set was a hit with the party guest (even the adults). I found it really was a positive builder for sharing / interactive playtime."
5,"Thomas & Friends ""Down by the Docks"" Set","I'm very pleased with this purchase. My 2-yr-old grandson is obsessed with Thomas & ""choo-choos"" and he loves this. It's durable enough for a pre-schooler with enough different items (ship, ""Cranky,"" the bridge, hills)to keep play interesting. The item was well-packed when shipped, so no problems with returns and replacements."
2,Dodge Hitch Cover,I thought this Hitch Cover was all aluminum. Disappointed that the backing for the emblem is plastic. Seems over priced for what you pay.
2,Dodge hitch cover,"I really should of payed attention to the other reviews, so listen up and pay attention. I got the same hitch cover everyone was talking about. The black and white one, ... it has a little ram emblem above the words in white ""RAM"". I believe its too late to send back for the moment since Christmas is really soon. But I will be contacing the seller as soon as I'm done writing this."
3,"Oh, the detail!!","Facts are interesting but the book moves very slowly due to the extreme detail about, not only Elvis, but everyone he ever came into contact with. He was a much more troubled soul than I had suspected. How sad. I am still trying to finish this book but am having difficulty."
2,Geared to very specific tastes!,"I bought this as a present for someone who really loves fairies... When I finally saw what I had actually sent, I was so embaressed: I thought it was pretty awful BUT I can see that there would be some people who would like it so I do not want to completely scare people from buying this. I really can't describe the book - it sort of has these very old fashioned sort of drawings of faires and you insert the pictures between the pages so the fairies sort of frame the picture. I think my problem was with the actual artwork - it's all a bit gaudy."
2,Product was DOA,I'm sure this product may function properly but the unit I received was damaged and non-functioning when I got it. Chose to get a refund over replacement. The return was simple and easy thus earning the two-star rating.
1,Not like my old Denman brush,"I purchased this brush to sadly replace my 12 year old Denman paddle brush that finally wore out. Based on the photos and description, it appeared to be the same large, Denman paddle brush that I had been using forever. Once I opened the package I knew it was cheaply made, as it was lighter weight and the handle was not as heavy. The plastic pins kept snagging my hair, again unlike my original Denman, leading me to believe it was just made differently. The telltale sign was one use with a blow dryer and almost 1/3 of the pins warped and melted to the side. I had never had this happen to my previous Denman brush or any other brush for that matter. I am actually returning this to Amazon as the quality is so poor I'm going to try and find a new paddle brush. Save your money and look elsewhere for a better quality brush."
3,Lem's Drier Side,"Though this lacks the jaunty tone of many of Lem's short stories or fictional essays, it still shares his disturbing habit of assualting your cerebrum in new and rather inventive ways. This book is sometimes as bizarre at is mundane, and this paradox is ultimately essential to the plot. But this book is enjoyed by a Lem fan, and I'm not sure that a reader unfamiliar with him will wait out the denoument..."
5,Very Pleased,"This microcassette recorder is just the right size to fit in a sportcoat inner pocket. With the external microphone jack you can clip a super sensitive mic on the pocket lip. With no auto-stop, there is no ""pop"" at the end of a tape, but you must turn the tape over to record on the other side. Operation is very easy, even in a jacket pocket, because the record button is easy to find and press, as when placing or removing a paper from the same pocket. So much for descrete recording. Fast forward or rewind is easy because of a separate slide switch. Pickup is good within 15 feet, fair beyond, with the internal and external mic provided. Selectable mic record level for close and distant recording. Specialized mics are available. Overall, a very well designed recorder for varied applications. Be aware of descrete recording laws in your state. For lectures, I recommend the GE model with auto-reverse."
3,Like a Tom Robbins novel. Except...,"lacking the wit of a Robbins novel. Lacking the charm, the clever writing, the magic, the spirituality, the sex (there was some, but it was quite machinelike), the true quirkiness. The story was, indeed, Robbinsesque. That's where the similarity ends. Sorry Mr. Moore. Good try, but you just didn't put it over."
5,A zany masterpiece!!,"Only Christopher Moore could come up with this wacky masterpiece about tropical island cultures, organ theft, airline pilots, and cargo cults. Somehow Moore, once again, creates a world that is equal parts ridiculous and believable. I don't know if any other writer could even do something like this. Its twisted in such a perfect way. I would it if Moore revisited the Shark people in a future novel. Great stuff!!"
3,"Some good, some not so good","This was my first Moore novel. I enjoyed it enough to give Moore another chance. The plot was tight and interesting and the characters were generally believable, but some of the humor was a bit forced. Still a good read."
5,Island of the Sequined Love Nun,"Delicious lunacy! An original, non-stop plot with unique, amusing characters. Lush description and attention to detail. I was hooked immediately. If you like Terry Pratchett, William Gibson, or Neal Stephenson, you'll enjoy this book."
3,"funny, but not as great as other moore books","well, shoot.christopher moore has risen to being favorite humorous fiction writer. i started with lamb, still in my list of favorite books. then i ventured into some of this other stuff (i've read fluke, the stupidest angel, you suck, and a dirty job, and loved them all).this one was funny, to be sure. and no writer out there can match moore's absolute wackiness in characters and storylines.but this one, unfortunately, was just too raunchy, over and over, for my enjoyment. maybe i'm puritanical; but it just didn't seem the raunchiness was necessary to the extent it was present.this is one of his older books; so maybe i just need to stick to newer christopher moore books."
1,just check for yourself,"Some things are controversial. Some things aren't. Some things are hard to check, some things easy. In making his case for the mystical origins of the pyramids in Giza, Mr. Heron claims that they stand at the middle of the earth, equal distance between the north cape of Norway and the southern tip of Africa. Use the distance calculator on infoplease. The northern tip of Norway is Nordkapp. The southern tip of Africa is basically L'Agulhas, South Africa. Find the distance between these two spots and Giza, Egypt (that's where the pyramids are); it takes about a minute. Nordkapp to Giza is about 2,853 miles. L'Agulhas to Giza is about 4,517 miles. Not even close. As with all things, check Mr. Heron's claims yourself."
5,Return of the giants...,"I enjoyed this book a lot....was very easy to read,very informative with lots of scriptual backing to the 'theory' of the book,and for anyone wishing to know more about Genesis 6 and how it relates to end time prophecy, a MUST! have book..."
3,A good all rounder.,"A good start to study end times, angels, nephilim, watchers etc. The writer provides good references for his opinions and is easy to understand. He delivers a persuasive argument for his opinons. My only criticism would be that he repeats himself too often and sometimes the content jumps around too much from topic to topic."
1,The Nephilim,"I was taken in by the title and description. The book seems to start out ok with pyramid facts and measurements, the usual stuff you've probably read a half dozen times. At the end of the first chapter the author asks...do the pyramids hold clues to the future?! Of course he never answers that question, instead, he moves on to the Nephilim who he believes are spirit beings of Satin. Somewhat later in the book, he returns to the Pyramid topic breifly by saying that the powerful Satin and his loyal angels built them along with other great earthly monuments.At about half way through the book, no kidding, he states that the remaining chapters were previously published in his last book with some new updates. This half of the book is his version of biblical prophecy. Save your money."
3,nephlim and the pyramid of the apocalypse,"being well versed on ufo's pyramids,fallen angels,aliens, etc. I already knew most of the things in this book.That said I did learn a lot more. There are things written in hieroglyphics that show us how these are the end times and especially how it was in the time of Noah and how we are now doing the exact same thing with genetics and experiments on creating half human half animal,,,, whatever those black projects create at Dulce and those other underground places where the aliens and humans create."
4,Raised More Questions,"I thought the book was very good. I've been interested in the details (what details there are that are credible) pertaining to Genesis 6 for a while now and Patrick Heron has provided some. I wished that Mr. Heron would have discussed more about the possibility of the existence of the Nephilim today (i.e., in this day and age). I question if there is another program by the fallen to dilute the human race again seeing as The Anointed (the one true hero in the greek sense) has all ready arrived in the flesh. The discussion about the pyramids was interesting and Mr. Heron suggests that the Holy City described in Rev. 21 is in the shape of a pyramid. Possible, ...but I prefer the interpretation of it being cubic in shape as this would make it a six (6) sided structure rather than the five (5) sided design of a pyramid. The number five (5) of course being associated with the adversary (Satan)."
1,A Christian book not a New age book!,"I was so dissapointed at this book>it's like I was listening to a sermon at a church. If you believe every word in the bible, you may enjoy it. Pleople should not forget that the bible was written by men not god. The words, stories and meaning might had been changed over the years."
5,"great book the truth that was needed to be told ,5 stars","truth is stranger than fiction, not to be missed."
2,it exists. kindle edition uk,Ok first off I'm almost positive Sir Terry Pratchett would like it better if he was getting his money for this book any way it was distributed. But it seems that the one place I can find this book in kindle edition is amazon's Uk store. Now this would be fine if I could download it from there. But for some reason you can't. I'm sure it has to do with the publisher's here in America making sure their coffers are kept full. But seriously if I can by a book from the Uk site I think a kindle version should work as well. But baring that if another country's site has it maybe just maybe the main site should as well? Just a thought.

4,Overall a good product,I ordered two of these and it does exactly what it is supposed to do as detailed in the written description.
3,Too wordy and lengthy content to focus the points well,"Even if it is taken as the popular textbook for MPC, I'd rather read the another one: ""Introduction to the materials management"" by Arnold and Chapman. I can not easily catch the points and feel muddled after reading long sections and words in this book. However, the examples and case studies here are worthy to have a big picture for those who are new in this field."
1,Bad book,"Terrible text from cover to cover. Entire book is too wordy, complex and overall confusing to get any points across to the reader. Needed it for a class and had to get tutoring because this book is a complete mess. I am usually a good student when it comes to learning out of the book but this text makes even the most simple concepts seem like doctorate student only knowledge. Avoid at all costs."
3,Great for Beginners,"This book is great for the Beginner Beader to learn the names and shapes of beads. As an Advanced Beader I was disappointed, assuming this directory would include more information, including history of particular beads, qualities of the stones and where they come from, where certain beads originate from. Perhaps a ""must-have"" for Beginners, but somewhat redundant for the Advanced Beader."
2,Very bland book,"I was very disappointed with the book. It is a VERY shallow view on many historical scientists. Frankly the book did nothing to me, it is so broad you will forget about it twenty minutes later. The biographical aspects mixed with the scientific contribution of that particular person amounts to virtually no information due to its brevity.It was a bit amusing to see the author trying to compact string theory in one paragraph with no math, but what is the point really? At this level of detail you will not learn anything.I can't imagine to what audience this book was written."
3,Not a bad Bond movie,"Not a bad Bond movie, but I miss Roger Moore. See ""Casino Royale"", with Craig, before you see this one. They go together. Not your father's James Bond."
1,This movie is terrible,"AV quality is great, but the content is terrible. Don't waste your money. Don't buy it, rent it."
1,They wrecked it,They simply wrecked the Bond personality when they chose Craig to play the part. Craig tries to play the tough guy and it is just pathetic. Bond should have the personality of the previous actors that have played him such as class and that hint of humour.
2,Not for an ipad,The reason I'm rating this 2 stars is because it doesn't really work well for the iPad. I bought the hd version thinking I would get a crisp beautiful display but it's just a widescreen standard visual. It does give you a list of of tablets that support hd but but it's not very clear.
1,Huge Let Down,"From an objective point of view it was an ok action movie.From a Bond fan POV, where the hell was Bond? About all that I recognized was another stupid homage with a gal in oil and the now usual Bond as an outcast.Oh yeah, the second disc was a complete waste. I LOVE special features and I could not even finish it.Craig is still a good actor but let him actually play Bond for Gods sake."
1,I've never been so bored watching a Bond movie!,"My family and I were looking forward to this Bond movie after enjoying Casino Royale so much. What a let down! The girl, though attractive, was boring. The plot was dumb and worst of all the movie flip-flopped too much. When the credits rolled and the song played I told my husband that even the song was awful!Interesing to see the reviews on this one all over the place! I could not recommend this one to any of my friends or family, ugh!"
2,imbarrassing to james bond,this is then i stopped watching the new James bonds. what was wrong with the original James Bond way. do not waste your time.
5,J. Durant Review,I received my movie in the order it was instructed and it worked perfectly. I got it in the mail fast.
3,Good action!!!,"This movie was all about action, action, action. I wish there James Bond would have had an epiphany right about now where he realizes the major flaws of his heart. But it was good."
4,Perfect but for two things...,"The first of the two things are the fights are getting a tad...unrealistic. I felt sorry for the car in the first scene and the hotel in the last part of the movie. Also, Agent Fields. Check out her first name in the credits. But enough of that. The rest of the movie is perfect and why? Because Daniel Craig is the best James Bond up to date.His manner of speech, his walk, the style of his fighting. He is a mean SOB, who plans to survive and will do anything to kill you. He is not nice and he isn't fair, and he rarely uses a pun or cracks a bad joke when somebody dies. He IS still the 007 from the books and as long as they allow him to stay that way I will continue to watch the films when they come out in the theater and will continue to buy the DVDs when they are released.The DVD has the trailers and the music video, but the movie is the reason to buy it. Used or new, get it."
3,Good movie but not up to par with casino royale,It was good and closer to a 31/2 star review and well it was enjoyable was a disappointment after seeing casino royale
3,Good Bond flick,good movie; I liked it better than when I first saw it since I'd just watched Casino Royale and the action in this movie picks up right after that movie.
1,So So Bad,Just trust me and don't watch it. This is the worst of Bond and I have seen them all. Sad is the only word to describe it. The last movie was so good and the new one looks good too. What happened?
3,"Good Settings and Camera Work, but the Rest of It ........?","The dialogue is especially hard to understand, much of it being delivered in clipped dialectic English. The action scenes are fairly ridiculous at times, i.e. who knew human beings could fight like that? And the ending is supposed to be a scene with Bond making love to a fair lady, not having a depressed conversation with his boss!"
1,Not What I Expected,"About 45 minutes into this film I realized that this was not about cute dancing penguins and chimney sweeps. Yowza, was that a surprise or what?!About that time my wife came downstairs and said, ""Why the **** are you eating ice cream directly from the container again?""So I called her over and said, ""Hey, come here. Do you see any dancing penguins in this?""She then told me that I was an idiot and that the movie I was expecting was ""Mary Poppins.""So then where's Bruce Willis?This was totally not what I expected."
1,Forces you to watch advertisements,When you buy a movie it is not acceptable to not be able to skip other content like trailers for other moviesDo not buy this version.
2,It just doesn`t work very well,The new version of James Bond just doesn`t work very well. And this one didn`t even have much of a plot.The older Bond films didn`t try to be too serious. A larger than life hero with plenty of action and liberally laced with humor were just fun to watch.The last 2 Bond films have lost that. They try to be taken seriously and the new Bond is not exactly a likable character. You find yourself not really caring if the bad guys manage to kill him off or not.The last 2 Bond films are just not fun.
3,Good but not great,"The first Daniel Craig, Bond film is better. If you are a Bond fan, I recommend Solace, as Daniel Craig, in my opinion, is the closest to the Sean Connery Bond! Hoping the next one surpasses the second."
3,Ian Fleming would probably have liked Daniel Craig . . .,"as the embodiment of his creation. However, I'm not so certain that he'd be thrilled with some of the ongoing adventures penned and produced by others that have crossed from the sublime well into the ridiculous. Great escape viewing but there was about as much believable action here as in the Marvel Comics films of today. Perhaps the Brocolli family can enlist Stan Lee for their next adventure."
3,It was okay.,"This installment of the James Bond series of movies was not as good as previous versions. Not awful, but not great."
3,Where's the dialogue? It felt like maybe 10 minutes worth of talking,"They cut out too many scenes to explain wtf was going on. they just cut and jump. Then, somehow bond becomes superman and breaks off a steel door handle. COME ON. The director was horrible, bad angles, etc.Casino Royale was amazing. This was just stuff blowing up with ZERO story.It got better later into the movie, that's the only reason why I give it 3 stars. I still like Daniel Craig as Bond - but I think the writer was horrible (the script is probably 20 pages long) and the director sucked - making the movie okay, at best."
3,Fair to Midland - 3 1/2 Stars,"Got all the Bond movies. I am a sucker for the franchise. I also like Daniel Craig and the new approach that they are doing with these films. This is the follow on story to ""Casino Royale"" and a lot of folks do not like it at all, but I do. It really isn't all that bad. I think its reputation suffers at bit because ""Casino"" was so damn good - which is the best Bond movie, or certainly in the top three best Bond movies. It's always tough to follow an act like that. If you like Bond then you will probably enjoy it and forget it. Pick it up cheap from one of the resellers."
2,Disappointing,"Quantem of SolaceWay too much action,- not enough clever dialogue or twists & turns in the plotAdded to which it was shipped from the States so instead of costing me $23:95 It cost me $34:95!! so if you are continuing this ---- That is why I cancelled My ""membership""M , Green"
2,Bond at his worst,I own all bond films and Quantum Solace starts out great but the action does not seem to go through the film all the way. Quantum Solace I give it a 2.0 - 2.5 out of five star review since the start is great but the end is terible. So if you are a James Bond fan at least watch it once in case Characters from Quantum Solace that you may have not seen are in the next James Bond film. I Hope the next James Bond film turns out better than Quantum Solace and hope you find this helpful from a James Bond fan!
2,They get more and more confusing with each new film.,"I'll give it this: the Blu-Ray presentation of this film is beautiful to look at and listen to. But the movie itself? I'm having a problem with the last couple Bond flicks: with each subsequent movie, they become more and more difficult to understand or make sense of. This one left me completely in the dark. By the end of this film, I still didn't understand who the bad guy was or what he had done, or why, I couldn't make heads or tails of the bad guy's ultimate goal, who was working for who, or why anything was happening at all. I think in trying to make a thinking-man's action movie, the Bond franchise has gone over the top and now makes movies that it takes a phd in quantum physics to understand. I'm done. No more bond."
3,On bond...,"I like the angry vengeful Bond portrayed in this movie. It's not as good as its predecessor Casino Royale or its successor Skyfall, but it's worth catching on TV."
3,"7,000 cuts ruin daniel craigs next outing","Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean. But, whomever edited this movie, ought to be tarred and feathered! I think theyre over 7,000 cuts in this movie. I think it completely ruins the action, and storyline.MTV + Asian cinema super fast edits, to make up for lousy choreography.I find it just about unwatchable because of this.Lets hope they wont make the same mistake again with the next outing."
2,Action sequences are too jerky and hard to follow,"I was very dissappointed by this movie due to the action sequences being extremely jerky and impossible to follow. The effects may have been great, but you wouldn't know it because the camera appears to be hand held and jerked all over the place to the extent that you can not figure out what is happening. All it does is convey movement and make you nauseous."
2,Settle down John Woo,"What ever happened to allowing an actor to build his/her character within a scene ? The world's microscopic attention span has affected director's and editor's to an alarmingly annoying level. I got dizzy in the first five minutes, Vertigo in the second five minutes, and was vomiting blood by the ending credits.At least the chicks are hot.Hugs,Kenny"
2,Not Bond,"This movie is ok as action movies go, but he is not Bond. We've been through alot of Bonds & I have my faves but this guy isn't a Bond at all. I had to keep reminding myself that I was watching a Bond flick."
4,Bond is one of my favorite series.,"Good quality on the video. Of the bond series it was in no way a favorite. In fact, it was a little to violent for my taste and needed more story."
4,Bond continues to be Super,i watched this one on Amazon since i missed it at the theaters. Great to get ready for the new bond film in November.
3,Meh,"While the acting might have been good, I found myself vastly underwhelmed with the plot itself. Other Bond films have had far more nefarious schemes with fascinating villains, but this one was rather lackluster. The plot to steal some water in one country, it simply did not impress me. If you're a die-hard Bond fan, you may want to watch this, but for a casual viewer like myself, I found this rather boring. The title didn't even make any sense to me."
1,Worst Bond movie ever,"No reason to belabor these comments - if you enjoyed the Connery/Bond movies, you will find this to be a deeply and excruciatingly painful degradation of the Ian Fleming novels. I will not watch or purchase another Bond movie with Craig in the lead role - for my money, he is almost the perfect ""anti-Bond"" - no culture, no sophistication, a deadly dull ""tough guy"" and totally politically correct - what a bore!!!"
2,Time For Bond to Retire,"The problem with QoS is that the villain is about as threatening as a Care Bear, and rather than getting his hands on nuclear missiles, he's attempting to corner 60% of the Bolivian water market. This would be weak enough if it affected somewhere in the US, but Bolivia? In an issue that would barely raise an eyebrow at the UN, Britain obviously decides to send its number one spy to fix the problem.In between a chain of over-the-top action sequences there's an InstantMix plot of no consequence. The plot points are TV-grade: in one 'pivotal' scene, Bond overhears the villain's master plans while hiding behind a fence. This is as much for the audience's benefit as for Bond's, in case we missed the over-signaled evil plan while being confused about the movie's title. Out-Bonded by True Lies and mercilessly parodied in Austin Powers, I think Bond's time may be over. It's really a shame since Casino Royale wasn't a good reboot of the franchise."
2,Only OK,We downloaded Quantum of Solace to watch over the holiday. I hadn't watched a James Bond movie for a while. I must say that this movie paled in comparison to the Sean Connery versions. The suave debonair Mr. Bond was part of the allure of the original shows. Quite lacking with the new Mr Bond.
3,Good but not superb like all Bond movies should be!,"Fast paced (too fast, frenetic?) Bond movie, with the usual mix of action, car chases, hard but never repelling violence and tremendous explosions. Call me nostalgic, but I preferred the more deliberate pace of Connery and Moore. In this movie I often found myself having to make an effort to follow the action. It looked more like a film preview, where they try to pack everything is a 2-minute extract, or a Music TV show.Acting is very good all around, and this is the major strength of the movie. The flying scenes are superb if a bit too incredible. Bond's witty humour comes out regularly, as usual, and Craig is almost as good as Connery.The BD contains interesting bonus scenes and backstage material."
1,poor action montage spoils it,"The action scenes had a strobe-light effect, so rapid was the cutting. It was so bad that this movie needs to be redone to reach its full potential. It's almost not even watchable."
1,Moonraker was better than this :(,From making a Bond movie in the top 5 best ever to making the worst Bond film ever. Poor Daniel Craig still does a good job but the plot sucks. The man with a Golden Gun and Moonraker look like pure genius next to this disaster.
4,A darker shade of James Bond,"What happens when the cool, calm James Bond goes on a kiling spree without permission from his Majesty's Secret Service? Well, you get to see a darker side to the trained professional who begins to travel down the road as an assassin out of control. As always, fasten your seat belt for on-the-edge-of-your-seat action with the 007 agent who is out for revenge!"
1,Absoluet dreck,"I went into this hoping to see some of the Roger & Me goodness, instead I got the bowling for columbine badness; the inept, heavy handed obvious fiction passed as fact.Don't waste your time, boring and poorly done fiction."
1,Remember when documentaries were worth something??,"Seriously, I really wish this guy would stop making these ""documentaries"". Roger and Me was brilliant, but since then it's been all about his agenda, they should be called ""propaganda-mentaries"" since all he edits so much of his material to make it fit his point.Films like this make me want to be a ""slacker"" because it shows just how much crap is going on. If a documentary film maker can't even make a documentary correctly the what's the point."
1,POOR!,"How could anyone in their right mind pay to see this. They should stop the sale of this dvd immediately! This movie makes no sense. These kids are running around in circles in this cave, Eddie Furlong is screeching at his friends. The lights in the cave flicker and go out in one scene, and it's complete darkness, at other times there is still light and shadows. When the girl gets cut in half, she is obviously buried in the dirt as you can see the ground moving. Another character, Wes gets sucked into the ground and comes out on the level below. He goes from wearing a backpack, to no backpack, and then it is back on again. Very poor acting and dialogue, as well as not so special effects.Don't waste your time, not even a good film to watch and make fun of, it's just that bad."
2,Almost sad,"I was almost sad for Edward Furlong in this film. He has really gone down hill. If you like ""B"" movies then this one is O.K."
1,"Not even in the ""so bad it's funny"" category.","If this had made it into the ""so bad it's funny"" category, I might've given it 2 stars. But no such luck.Like probably a lot of people, I saw this movie because I'm a fan of one of the cast, Amber Benson. Thank god for the quick turn-around of Netflix or I would've been mad about paying to see this instead of just highly disappointed. I can't speak for the rest of the cast, but I know Amber Benson is capable of much better than this. The so-called plot gave the cast nothing to work with, the direction stank, the sets were so obviously cheap, and the ""special effects"" were the lamest of the lame.I once heard Amber Benson spoke of one of her other films, Taboo, and told people not to pay to see it because it was so bad. If she said that about Taboo, I can't even imagine what she would say about Intermedio."
5,A Great Read,"I loved this book. It is thorough, well organized, and thoughtfully researched. The author is passionate but technical. He had a vision, pursued that vision, and accomplished what he set out to do."
2,Single glove,"I didn't check the item closely enough to notice that the package only contains 1 glove - not a pair - which was disappointing to me. However, it would have cost me more money to return it, so I kept it. The material is somewhat flimsy and the material does not cover enough of the fingers for me. I would have preferred the glove to come up to the first knuckle or above."
2,"Beware, backing comes unglued","I completely agree with one of the other reviews. This is an expensive mat when you see that that the backing comes unglued. Our mat also is now warped. Yes, the kids do not know what the problem is, but they do realize that all of their cars do not run on the mat properly. This would be better if not a felt top, but rather an actual woven carpet with design. We barely used this carpet when the ungluing happened. Find a different product."
3,pleased,"i got this product because thats all my daughter wanted for her bday. when she got it of course she was excited, she loves it! me being the mom it gets annoying and it is loud! so from my daughters side great product from the mothers side annoying, but a good toy :)"
2,This is terrible,"Han Bennick is an impressive free jazz drummer. His best work has been with saxophonist, Peter Brotzmann.But something has gone radically wrong on this recording. He is accompanied by an instrumentalist, who makes the glaring mistake of trying to sing. He cannot, and I could not bear it. Sans singing, this CD might be worth it, given Bennik's talents. But the other guy just ruins it."
4,Anything with Jack Lemmon is worthwhile!,"I have always loved this movie, Jack Lemmon is at his comic best, but it needs to be re-released in a wide-screen format. A lot of this Cinemascope presentation is lost in the current pan and scan version."
3,"love you guys, but this could be better","I've been a Saliva fan ever since the first time I heard ""Your Disease"" back in the day. It just took me a while to get past the disgusting name and admit it. I've seen them live and as you could imagine, they were incredible. This new album is ok, but I think they could do so much better. Most of the songs are good, but nothing here is as catchy as the aforementioned ""Your Disease"", or ""Always"", ""Rest in Pieces"", etc.God bless you guys!!"
2,Copycats should be their name,Every song on this CD sounds as though these guys sat down and listened to other bands and then tweeked the tune a little. The second song on the CD sounds like Animals from Nickelback. If you know who Galactic Cowboys are then you'll recognize Ladies And Gentlemen etc... The best song might be Blacksheep but every song on here got copyed from someone.
3,Some good and some bad,"Not bad, but make sure you skip track 7 ""Twister"". Probably the worst thing I've ever heard from a rock band. I also didn't care for track 8 ""Black Sheep"". I kept reading reviews saying that it was good, but it was an easy rip off of a nickleback song that wasn't even that good of a song to begin with in my opinion.I also read reviews saying that this album isn't very good cause it's not all hard rock, but I still think this album is a lot better than their last album ""Survival of the Sickest"" which was repetative and boring."
3,fun toy,"We've had this toy for over a year now. My son loves the noises the steering wheel makes and loves that the truck picks up the shapes. However, he likes to push it sometimes and he likes to ride it. In order to move the seat from 'push' to 'sit' mode, it takes an adult (with two coordinated hands!) to change it. I have found this to be the most frustrating part of this toy. There should be a way to change settings without having to push two buttons and pull at the same time. In addition, it would help if there were some sort of braking mechanism. Other than that, my son - now 19 months old - absolutely loves it!"
4,nice toy,This was purchased for my son for his first birthday. He loves it and so does his older brother and sister. He has not rode on the toy yet because he is to little. He can use it as a push toy just fine. It doesnt tip over or flip when he goes to pull up on it. He likes the steering wheel and I like the fact I can take it off and bring it with us if we want. The only thing I would change is to make the seat like more like a shape sorter. Where the shapes fall through the seat not just sit on top of it. Other then that I am very pleased with it and plan on getting him the crane for Christmas to go with it. I wish Tonka still made these items so the would be available in the stores.
3,Has some issues,"After reading the reviews for this toy on Amazon my wife and I bought it for our 11mo old son. Once we assembled it and he started playing problems started popping up. It seems durable, but time will tell.Pros- Durable, low costCons- The seat cant be removed by a small child, even I had trouble pressing in on the pins to remove it.The frame of the truck sits so low that it get caught on the carpet making it hard to push.The engine noise gets irritating after awhile"
3,Nice book - but too pricey for what you get!,"I would have liked to rate this book far higher than three stars - but when comparing value to content - the book doesn't cut it. Softcover, OK paper and absolutely no illustrations, save the cover - it's simply not worth $35.00 ($37.49 with shipping and handling). Comparing it to Beveridge and Hall's book which was self-published - at $18.95 (on sale now for $16.95) the book seems even steeper in price.The author says that the book ""Art of Titanic"" by Marschall is ""pricey"" - compared to the price of this book for what you get the Marschall book is a bargain!The author did a great job of compiling all the sources, and it's a good source book for books, films and the like. I just have reservations concerning the price.Ray"
3,Unworthwhile package,"The game came late and one of the disks was broken, I proceeded to throw it out because I realized the titles I wanted are all included in Command and Conquer first Decade which was a much more economical and you didn't have to change compatibility settings to run it."
3,Disappointed,"I wish I could say this is a good book, because I truly like and admire Arthur Laurents-- his work, his intelligence, his integrity. But ""Original Story By"" is unevenly written. Some paragraphs are so poorly put together they require rereading and even then the author's meaning remains obscure. The book is full of interesting gossip-- almost too much... however rather little is revealed about the author himself. What I liked best was the description of how stage productions and motion pictures are creatively formed-- how they can be so easily sabotaged by an unsympathetic director, self-centered actors, profit motivated changes and cuts. Under these circumstances, it's truly amazing and rare when everything can come together and result in great theatre and film."
2,Fascinating career-- Thrown together memoir- what a shame...,"Quite an amazing disappointment. Reads like a barely edited transcript-- awkward, inconsistent, clumsy and flat. Rambling and often incoherent.For American Theatre students- one extra star for the West Side Story/Gypsy chapter."
4,"Professionally packaged, slightly on small size, medium durability","Title says it all. Overall I have and will purchase these again.Packaging - Professional and nice with green plastic sleeve with brand clearly marked.Size - Seems slightly on the small side but still fit fine. I wear a men's size 8.5 which is squarely in the middle of the stated range for this insert but there was still a little room for the insole to move around insides my shoes. I purchased 4 of these and put them in 4 different sneakers and it was a similar experience in 3 of the 4 so I don't think it was just the shoe.Durability - Medium. I have had my oldest insert for more than a month and while it is holding up, I have noticed a decline in the cushioning effect."
3,"Okay to soften the sole, not support the arch.","If all you want is a softer bottom to your shoe, these may work well, but they will not add support to your arch."
2,Not a great product,"I had high hopes after seeing some very positive reviews mixed in with the negatives. I purchased these insoles before heading to Orlando, FL because I knew I was going to be doing a lot of walking and my old running shoes needed a boost. They felt great at first, but by the end of the day I had a hard time walking because my heels hurt so much! Unfortunately, I can't recommend this product."
2,SAme thing again!,"THis is the same!There are three lip gloss makers!All are bad,but there is one that is small.You can carry it anywhere.There is a other one that looks just like,but itdoes not say refill,but it's the same the.THey have small packs of refills.Buy that one."
3,Okay I guess,Nice colors but our daughter never seemed to think they were very comfortable compared to other shoes she wears. She typically wanted these off her feet after a short time. I think it may be due to the fact that they have tread INSIDE the shoe as well as on the bottom of the shoe. Very odd concept.
5,Very good,Very good value for money and a lot of fun with up and down tracks. Good quality and fully applicable with brio.
3,Gentle read.,"By today's standards this is not a gripping book. However, it is a good, gentle read.The ending is quite easily anticipated, but it was a nice, quiet read."
2,Not really 4 inches...,"So the earring is nice and all, but DEFINITELY NOT 4 inches. Mine is 2.5"" long, which is MUCH smaller than I expected and what I needed. Is it pretty? Sure. Will I wear it? Probably not as it's not as dramatic as I expected. That 1.5"" that's missing makes a HUGE difference on the look you're going for. Quality is good, but really disappointed as I was going after a long earring, not your regular, you can buy anywhere length. Check back, as I'm posting a picture of it on top of a ruler."
5,Awsome,Great music. Who wouldn't love this collection by Zappa and the Mothers. I think I got this with Amazon points.
2,Uncomfortable and too pointy,"These sandals looked great in the box, but as soon as I put them on I could tell they were too pointy, looking like they were big on me. As to comfort, forget it!! These sandals actually CUT my feet, the pretty stones are great in theory, but the manufacturer didn't execute the idea well. I wore these once and gave them away."
3,Unfinished teaching of Hermetics.,"Yes, you can find ""different Hermetics"" in this book. Author also make Kabbalah system look clear for me. His techniques based on imagination (including imaginary temple, ""giant"" of five element etc). Unfortunately, you can find only level 1-5 techniques. You must wait his next book about level 6-10. Business trick ? Maybe. You can buy his CD and other equipment for Hermetic. Author give us his website."
2,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter...,She didn't like it very much because some of the songs are cut off.
3,Too bulky and not really portable,I am returning to work now and find that this pump is too bulky and difficult to use at work. It has too many connections and tend to be wobbly and cords tangle easily.However as a stationary in home use pump it is excellent and very comfortable.
5,Philips Avent Isis iQ Duo twin elec. pump,This is my favorite. I used the hospital grade Medela and the manuel Avent. This pump really worked the best for me. I liked being able to hold the suction until the milk stopped coming. It was quite and smoothe. It was easy to work. Yes all the pumps have to be put together it didnt take long to do and I just kept it in the bag ready to go. I would recommend this pump to anyone. If I do have another child I will get this pump again!
4,Time enough for love,"This made for ""abc"" family movie is better than most Hallmark productions. It is actually form Crawfish Productions, LLC which should give you a clue to its content.An anthropologist Pax (Barry Watson) discovers money and a book on forbidden love in and old ship. He is intrigued to find out about this forbidden subject. So with the help of his mentor and friend Bob (Fred Willard) he goes back in time to inquire the meaning of love and other mysteries form the book's author Elizabeth Barrett (Sara Rue.)Will he find the answers?Will Elizabeth find a few answers of her own?Will we find a few answers in the process?"
5,Iguana Bible,I have had my Green Iguana for 17 years. This book has been my Iguana Bible. I refer to it for everything including the design for a custom habitat. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering buying an Iguana or already has one.
5,Appreciation,"First of all I would like to compliment you on your prompt service and for the first time ""What you say is what you get!"". I have done various purchases from outside of South Africa and for the very first time I have received the product on time and intact. I could not believe my eyes when I went to the post office on the date promised 11 January 2012 and lo and behold the slip for the book was there. I salute you for excellent service thank you very much. I wish I could say the same for other businesses. The product (the book) was for my son for christmas and he has complimented you on a easy reading, easy learning product. Please convey our thanks to all the people concerned with this purchase and delivery. I really will contact you again should the need arise.Once again Thanks. May you be blessed in your business and in the New Year!Maggie Smit"
4,A nice follow-up,"It took too long for America to come out with a Greatest Hits volume 2, but Rhino finally did it in 1991. This is a collection of later hits, album cuts, plus five songs not available on any other America album. Some songs were produced by legendary Beatles producer George Martin. Contains the hits Today's The Day, You Can Do Magic, The Border, and Right Before Your Eyes. Other strong songs include the original version of Everyone I Meet Is From California, Cornwall Blank, and Another Try. Highly recommended."
2,Grossly overpriced low quality,"When I buy several pieces of wood for a hundred bucks I expect it to be of top quality. Unfortunately, not the case here.Tracks do not fit together tightly creating gaps and bumps that cause trains to tip over. Ascents and descents are too steep for trains with carts to stay on rails. Figures and structures are very primitive with dull prints on the sides. Would not recommend it."
1,False Advertising.,Retail price is listed as more than $90.00. Bought at Amazon 90% off sale. I received 24 cups. 24 CUPS? With a retail of $90.00 Who's fooling who here. DO NOT fall prey to this product.
1,Black Oggi Canister Set sold by Home Trends,"Purchased this set in March, and they were chipped. I phoned the owner, he sent me a prepaid Federal Express Envelope, and I shipped them back. It is May and I still have not received my refund."
5,The Path to Spiritual Growth and Service,"""Workout For The Soul"" is a rare book in that it combines teaching us how to develop ourselves with showing us how to be of service to others. Other self-development books concentrate only on the self. Chrissie Blaze shows us how in 15 minutes a day we can develop ourselves so much that we can become powerful lights in our dark world, as well as attaining great fulfilment and abilities for ourselves. It is clear that Chrissie Blaze has had access to one of the greatest Masters of all times - the knowledge and insights are extremely profound and not found elsewhere. Chrissie blends her own warmth, compassion and understanding with the metaphysical knowledge to make for a wonderful book."
5,Great bonding tool that's fun & healthy,"My kids loves this because THEY get to select the cards and twist Mama into a pretzel. It their choice and we are doing an activity TOGETHER. There are some good/simple breathing & meditation techniques in there too, aside from the poses."
4,PRODUCT RECALL -- GREAT TOY,The fire station and related items have been recalled due to possible lead paint contamination from the Chinese factory which manufactured them.
1,nexus- the jupiter incident,"I was hoping for a game as good as Homeworld. Unfortunately, this game is outdated, but most importantly really, really slow in it's plot. Oh well."
5,Havent read the book yet,"I have yet to read the book, but I have been trying to do research on my family and I am so glad to see something documented about my Moragne heritage. Thank you for this."
3,Whitecap Marine Fitting - Good,"This product was what it was promised to be as far as size, dimensions, and quality. However, the color was not white....it was black. This makes two times in a row from teh same seller that it was supposed to be white and I was shippd black. The product itself is great and I have no complaints, I was just hoping for white to match the other fittings on my boat."
1,My dog must be a super chewer . . .,". . . because this bone did not last. Within a few hours over two days, the bone was gone. Based on previous reviews by owners of aggressive chewers, I expected more than this. Sam is shelter dog, PBGV and beagle mix, and loves to chew. He's active and well-entertained by activities other than just chew bones, but this rawhide did not last; in fact, it was less durable than supermarket bones. Maybe Sam is special and needs to be a chew bone test dog?"
4,Good For A Quick Fix Of Motivation,"Art Williams is truly amazing. From a career as a high school football coach to the owner of his own insurance company Williams went from pauper to millionaire.This book is an incredible story of success in spite of tremendous odds and obstacles. Art Williams grew his insurance company, A.L. Williams (now Prime America I believe), when Prudential and other companies dominated the market.Nearly everyone was telling Art that it couldn't be done and that he was nuts. They laughed at him.Who's laughing now? Well, Prudential is still around, but Art Williams is certainly able to laugh or do whatever he wants now. Maybe you can too if you follow his lead. The first step is to get this book and read about this amazing individuals' life."
2,had some goofy songs I had never heard before. my anticipation of what it could have been was ruined when I heard it.,This cd has songs on it that I would never have thought were recorded my this group. appeantly they did. just my opinion but this is not what I anticipated would be on the cd.
3,Wrong Version of Crimson and Clover,"The original LP version of Crimson and Clover is the single lengthened to 5.5 minutes and had a ""faulty"" lower speed extra instrumental middle bit in it that had a noticeable tone change where it joins which made a really great classic record even more unique and I really liked it that way. This otherwise excellent CD has the Crimson and Clover version but it has lost a lot of its appeal to me because the tone change has been corrected.I quote from the 8 page cover booklet ""Rhino has corrected the error and we now hear the long version in its proper form for the very first time"". Please if you know of a CD that has the original (not the sanitised re release here) version please let me know by reviewing/commenting.Thanks"
5,Thomas the train acending wooden tracks,This works for Thomas the Train and Brio wooden tracks. The acending tracks are not an actual bridge as one review stated. They are however the only way for the trains to go up and down all the various bridges. My kids love them. They have made a huge railway system with their Thomas the Train and Brio tracks and accessories. It keeps them entertained for quite a while. We do help them build the tracks since they are only 2 & 3 and not engineers but helping them is half the fun!
2,Lid plastic wall and thread too weak to hold the bottle,"Perhaps a good idea, but too skimpy on execution. Lid plastic wall and thread too weak to hold the bottle with water."
2,"Stinky, but that's it...","I live on a small property of a couple of acres and occasionally in the summertime, one of the kids will leave the back door open and we'll get some flies in the house. I bought this thinking that it would attract all the flies in the house and catch them. So far, it's been sitting in a sunny window for a week and it's only caught one fly. I would say to save your money and buy a fly swatter."
3,"It's ""Louie Louie"" time!","This was the second (and last) album of various versions of ""Louie Louie"" released by Rhino Records. This time around, there is only one novelty version recorded especially for the album (thefirst volumehad three novelty versions). That would be the version sung in Russian by the fake Russian rock band Red Square. Every other version of the song was previously released, and they are more or less played seriously. It can get a bit tedious hearing the same song over and over again, which is probably why the CD limits itself to ten tracks. At least they found versions of the song played in several different styles; including pop-rock, latin jazz, girl group, surf, New Orleans jazz, British Invasion, jazz-rock and R&B.; If ""Louie Louie"" is your favorite song, you need to get this CD."
1,Save your money.,"Honestly, save your money. You can find reviews on the internet for Farscape episodes free. This book is filled with typos, (I caught at least half a dozen), the episodes are listed out of order, and, well, what made me very angry is that he completely botches a review of an episode, because he didn't seem to understand what was going on. Plus, he gives away some spoilers to what happened in the early parts of season 2 (Not that I mind spoilers, but someone who hasn't seen it yet might be upset by it.) I was very disappointed with this - in fact, I actually kind of ordered it on accident, because I thought it was something else. As a diehard insanely obsessed Scaper, I do NOT recommend this book - I say, just go read reviews off websites."
1,Poor Book,"The book has decent summaries of the episodes, but the episode critiques often are very weak. While they offer occasional insight, they frequently nitpick or resort to vulgar feminist rants. In several cases it is clear the author completely misses the point of an episode, or even the show itself. If you are a thoughtful, educated fan of the show, the book will likely really annoy you."
2,Much better stuff on line,"This book has amateur written all over it. Plot summaries often miss the point or don't know when something is tongue-in-cheek. Detsails are frequently overlooked and references to other sci-fi shows are either beside the point or were diliberately done by the producers. Critiques show immaturity of the author and his concern for the sexuality of the show affecting a 10-year-old viewer will become absurd as the adult themes of the show develop. No photos, no humour, no brains."
3,mixed bag,"High point of the disc is a rousing King Kong, which has zappa's amusing introduction. Some real fine blowing by the horn section. Then a bonkers it can't happen here, loads of 'noise' including radio transmission, very out there. These two take up most of the 40 or so minutes. Also there is a 'waltz' version of you didn't try to call me, it's good. Big leg emma is ok, then you have various covers of different tunes like baby love, hound dog, bristol stomp. Moderately enjoyable tunes. Sound quality is reasonable for a bootleg...it has better sound than freaks and motherf***ers for instance. If you've never heard Frank Zappa's music, this is not a good place to start, get an official release. But king kong and it can't happen here are treasures, making this cd worthwhile for zappa fans."
2,Bad Batch?,"Don't know if I just got a bad batch or something, but the package I received had such a strong chemical smell, and my dog seemed to like them okay at first, but then was drinking water like crazy, and puked it back up a few hours later..."
2,My dog loved the beef flavor but not the peanut butter,"These sticks don't smell like peanut butter at all, so my dog didn't like them... though she goes absolutely gaga over real peanut butter. Also these sticks are much softer than the beef flavor, which my dog likes. After begrudgingly eating a couple of these, she barfed, and has not wanted them since. If you need to buy this, go for the beef flavor!!"
4,works great!,I have used this in my classroom. My students put their finished papers in each file folder according to the subject on that folder. This makes it veryessy to find out who was still working on each assignment.
3,Would be Perfect if everything was THERE,"I ordered two of these to hold my notes, handouts, and tests from my classes after I'm finished with them. Overall, the product works the way it says that it will. The only problem I can find with it- THEY DID NOT SEND TABS for ONE of them. So I have folders that go into the container, but I have no TABS for them. Needless to say, I am very upset about this. I would have given this a five if they had included everything that was supposed to come with it. I honestly cannot even give it a four. Now I have to go out and either buy tabs for them, or buy brand new hanging folders. Either way, I have to spend more money. Be careful when ordering this. You should probably just buy separate folders to be on the safe side. Wow, more money that customers have to dish out because someone got lazy..."
4,Works... but it blew away!,"This works. I will order it again. But I will anchor it better so it doesn't blow away. I lost it in a wind storm. It smells pretty bad, but it also works in the house. I brought it indoors and set it in the bathtub when the flies were particularly obnoxious inside. Opened the (screened) window in the bathroom, and they flocked to it in there. I set it back outside after a while, when I could begin to smell it. I wouldn't keep it in the house with windows closed, however. Phew!!!"
1,Does not work,It has been sitting out for a week and the flies just sit on top of it or fly around it. Waste of money.
3,Know your fly types & seasons,"Purchased for my dog kennel, I'd read a little about varieties of flies & don't think this one was for the variety we have. Either that or by the time the Catchers came in I'd missed most of the 'season'. These didn't catch very many flies but, then .. note the aforementioned."
1,A very poor fly trap,"It was clumsy to use, very smelly and did not work well. I ended up throwing it away as it was no longer catching any flies after only a few weeks. It was promised to last for three months but it quit catching flies after only two or three weeks.The older Victor fly traps worked much better but are now unobtainable. They had a black screw on cap with a bright yellow dome shaped cover and a little black fly that perched on top and held it together. For the bottom they used a quart mason jar which was easy to fill. They were also easier to empty and start over when they did begin to smell. I wish that someone would manufacture them again."
1,Didn't work. Poor Design.,"My fly trap did not come with the white cover as pictured, so when hung outside it collects and fills with rain water. However, before or after being filled with excess rain water, it failed to catch any flies."
1,"so fragile, breaks easy and fly comes out of it if it breaks","it is using plastic cup so fragile and cheap. Much weaker than normal plastic disposable cup. I ended up throwing it away when fly comes out of the hole because it broke within few days. Buy same brand, but not disposable type (Even this one you have to throw away after it is filled with flies because bait pack is not so cheap and it is nasty to empty it out - you would see thousand of flies and may be maggots) However, the other unit by the same company works really well."
1,Doesn't work.,"The cup hanger broke after a few days of hanging in a fly infested area. The cup didn't catch a single fly and ended up in the garbage. Sad to say, I resorted to poison sprays and sticky tape."
2,Not What I Expected,This is another pop psychology book backed by little real science. The author seems to have written it more for self-therapy than for contributing anything to the scientific community. I would recommend reading a summary of the work and not wasting time with the rest of it. The only value add this brings to the table is the re-introduction of a personality disorder running rampant in modern American culture.
3,Depends on what you are seeking,"I am an adult child of a narcissistic parent. I found chapters 1 - 5 very interesting with a fascinating take on how different children within the same family can receive somewhat different abuse from a NPD parent and/or how those children respond to their individualized suffering. I found this book as helpful (but no more helpful) than the two others I had read in providing strategies to limit NPD abuse. From Chapter 6 on (roughly the last third of the book), the book was of limited use to me as it talked about having an NPD individual in an intimate love relationship or a social/professional relationship. I finished the book, but realized that for my purposes I had really finished it after Chapter 5."
4,Worth the money...so convenient.,"You cannot beat this item for the price. I live on the north side of Chicago, where seemingly ever FM station picks up some signal, and this transmitter works perfectly. I tried the stations that the ITrip Station Finder recommended for my area, and I ended up back at the default 87.9 because it comes in flawlessly. The only drawback is that it does drain the battery a little faster, but you could always pick up a cheap car charger if you have a long trip planned. The best feature is that is so small and lightweight, which makes it amazingly convenient to travel with, so much better than all the cords and plugs that are usually associated with FM transmitters."
1,Does not work with 120 GB Ipod Classic,Amazon advertises the tranmitter with the 120 GB Ipod Classic but it is not compatible.Amazon also shows it as Frequently Bought Together.The connections on top of the Ipod do not match those of the transmitter.
3,spotty,"I always used the default 87.9 MHz. Changing to and from other frequencies was too much of a hassle. 87.9 works out okay in San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area.But it really depends on how good your car radio is. I've had friends say that theirs doesn't work on theirs, but works on others."
1,Griffin I Trip,"Unfortunately it does not fit my Ipod so it is useless for my application. I think I just through it away,"
5,Saves on batteries,"Owning the Canon PowerShot S5 IS, this power wall adapter saves on the batteries, since I'm constantly reviewing and deleting pictures off my 2 GB card. I don't use the camera's battery power anymore."
5,Satisfied Customer,"Just what I needed, arrived in only a few days after the order was sent and not damaged!Two thumbs up!"
5,Can't file without it!,"When faced with a mound of papers that must be alphabetized, this is the go-to product! I used it extensively when I worked in an office and bought my own to help with filing at church. It makes the job so much easier!"
2,the accents make it almost unbearable,"I just started liking RBD's spanish music a few months ago and like a lot of those songs. This effort, however, was mostly cringe worthy. Dulce's voice, which isn't that good in Spanish, is especially horrible in english. This cd is full of translations from previous spanish singles which sounded a lot better in their original language. I do like the beat to wanna play, but that's pretty much it. The rest of the songs I'll listen to in their original state."
3,"Good, but should have purchased the later version","Have tried in vain to develop a calendar; all goes well until you try to enter text in the text box. The tutorial doesn't assist you in that navigation. Otherwise, I would have had a beautiful calendar to send to family members."
2,Brainiac Thriller,"""Anamorph"" is a brainiac thriller where the killer's cleverness vies with sheer level of brutality. Willem Dafoe stars as Stan Aubray, a cop who was burned out five years earlier with a grizzly crime and is dragged back into a current copycat killing. Or is it a copycat? Scott Speedman who was Felicity's TV love interest plays Carl Uffner, Stan's new partner. Carl isn't sure whether to trust Stan or suspect him. Clea Duvall fromZodiac (Widescreen Edition)& TV's ""Heroes"" plays Sandy Strickland, who gets caught up in the crime. Deborah Harry from the rock band Blondie had previously worked with director Henry Miller on ""I Remember You Now."" She has a cameo as a neighbor. Peter Stormare who was so impressive as the hair-triggered killer inFargo (Special Edition)plays Blair Collet. While the art analysis is interesting, the film falls short as I cared less about Stan and the victims and was mostly turned off to the brutality. Ultimately, the bang was not worth the buck. Taxi!"
1,Crash your system ASAP!!!,"***** Warning ******I just bought this software, and it had crashed my system right away after installation. Luckily I have norton goback, otherwise I am in deep trobule. It have been 2 days since I have bought this software, and getting email help from the company is very very slow. Instead of helping me, they ask where I both the product for the do no see my registration. Helllooooo of course not, because it crash my system!!! Read CNET review, they gave this produc ta bad review due to crashing!I got rip off!"
3,Standard fare,"This is the story of Shane, a popular pop singer who hates the limelight and wants out, and a secretary for the band he plays for, Submission, Rhiannon. Shane was a playboy and blackmailed Rhi into marrying him to get her into bed, but when she discovered he was a virgin, he suddenly discovers he has scruples, and pulls away. However, soon, predictably, nature takes its course and they have their way. Afterward, jealousy and predictable obstacles threaten, but everything works out. A subplot about Shane finding his roots in Asia was poorly fleshed out and hardly mentioned except as an afterthought at the end. A standard book but nice if you don't want to think."
2,Doesn't last long,"The thermometer worked for me for several months, seemed accurate, but after that it got stuck on a certain temperature and has completely stopped working."
1,It quit working!!,I am very disappointed in this thermometer. It quit working within a month of getting it. It would cost just as much to send back probably as my refund would be so it's not worth the bother!!
4,Good little thermometer,It helps to set the oven temperature correctly. I hung it on a rack and can read it easily through the oven door. Had to bend the hook a little so it holds tight to the rack and not fall down.
3,Not so sure,"I needed this to keep an eye on my oven for Christmas dinner and I can't say that I could rely on it too much. It was around the right temperature but I couldn't be sure if it was actually accurate. The hook at the top is useful, and the unit is large enough to read the numbers easily, and the price is pretty nice. Overall I wouldn't really buy this if you're looking for precision."
5,Great Product!,"Taylor has always made good products. When I got the thermometer, it had a large, very easy to see face and was packaged very well. I've already used it in my oven and it was accurate on the temp when I compared it with a digit oven thermometer."
1,Useless product,"this product is useless it repels the fly's whiles everything else attract them a cup of tea cot more fly's whilst one fly fell in it by mistake, if you ask me I would say try killing fly's with something else this product is a wast of your time and money."
4,Pretty Flip Flops,"I had to return my original order because the sandals were too small. These flip flops are made SMALL! Sending them back though was really easy and then I received my replacement pair in a timely manner. If you are ordering this item, order one size up! Otherwise though, this item is very pretty. I would definitely order from these guys again!"
1,I was trapped,It came with a broken light. To good to be true. It was not true. Where is my money? I will keep the trap and send you the fleas.
4,"Trap Great, Refills overpriced in my opinion","I appreciate the need for a flea trap. Living in Florida, bugs are everywhere. With indoor dogs and cats the number feels like it multiplies. I like the product, but I'm not sure a piece of contact paper cut to size wouldn't perform comparably. The lighted base is wonderful. Great nightlight and path provider. Heck, I've got 3 of them! =))"
2,I thought it would be better,"I bought this trap in hopes to get rid of the fleas in my house. All the trap did was trap spiders, moths and flies. I placed the trap in every room, in every corner of my house and NO fleas showed on the sticky paper."
1,"Didn't work for me, but maybe I didn't have enough fleas","My dog was having a serious flea problem and I figured it was the whole house since I could see the fleas jumping off my bed. Our house is very clean and I vacuum once a week so I was surprised to see so many fleas. I bought this trap with enthusiasm, as I really wanted to see it work. My husband laughed at me and rolled his eyes when he saw me setting it up. I put it next to the dog bed. Two weeks and not a single flea! Everyday I would check it and my husband would just laugh at me. I think I was more upset that my husband was right about it being a waste of money than it not working. But, it did make a good night light. Other than that, it didn't work. Maybe I didn't have enough fleas. Bummed."
2,Didn't Work Well,Attracted one flea due to the warmth of a small lightbulb. Then the bulb burned out.It's in the trash.
1,"Great sounding idea, not so effective","The idea seems logical and very attractive. But after 3 weeks it has trapped zero fleas. My cat has a flea allergy, so it doesn't take but one flea to set off her allergy. At night this is the only light except a night light in the bathroom. I'll try the suggestion to make the whole area dark except for the trap--maybe that will work.I have tried vacuuming, and the solution of vacuuming daily for 7 days seems more effective, although admittedly more work.Best think I can say about the flea trap is it makes a very effective night light."
5,I really Loved this book,"This book will have your young girls wanting to read again. You can really relate to the characters in the book and their situations. They're not running around with magic pants to make every okay. It's real, the situations are real and I just loved it. It's just long enough to make for a really good read.Every young pre-teen girl and boy should read this book and then talk to your parents about it after they read it too."
4,"David Schipper's ""Sell Out""","Well, if anyone wants to know the real truth, just ask someone who was there. David Schippers has written a hard-hitting book, which causes one to stop and consider just how far our government has slidden from greatness into almost total darkness.David names names and you will find out what you probably did not want to know. However, those who love this land and what it stands for will want to know the whole truth, however distasteful that may be.I highly recommend reading this book."
1,17 cartons of documents:,I realize now why the impeachment didn't work. They had 17 cartons of documents. Every one knows it takes 50 cartons of documents to oust a sitting prez. David came to slay the giant but he forgot his sling.
1,These authors are almost right,"Unfortunately they missed the part about the Georgia businessman who stumbled into a money laundering machine managed by Clinton and Zell Miller. The guy was kidnapped for 7 months to prevent disclosure of Worthen and United Community Banks.But what Clinton and his ""bosses"" didn't know was the amount of power a single citizen could weild when backed up by the FBI!"
3,"actually, 3 and a half stars.................","the sound quality is not so good. A couple of the songs are a bit weak, but the other ones shine. JLP, FZ, Ruth Underwod, Tom and Bruce Fowler, Ralph Humphries, George Duke, and an uncredited Ian Underwood, make for some pretty great musicians up there on stage. As far as I know, this was the only tour with this exact lineup in it, which is a shame, 'cause when they were on, they were on. Also a lot of ""experimental"" type music here, typical Zappa dissonance, and songs that were still in their infancy. Overall a good CD, but the sound quality is what gets to me."
3,"Good, but not the best.","First of all, this is not a bad reccord. In fact, is actually good. I would even give a higher note if it wasn't a Frank Zappa's record. But, as I just said, IT IS a Frank Zappa's record, and I believe there are better stuff composed by him in other records, like ""strictly genteel"", ""Grand Wazzoo"", ""Roxy & Elsewhere"", ""King Kong"", ""Hot Rats"". But maybe I'm just not ready for this record yet. Certainly,in here is some of the most complicated Zappa's work, wich take a while to be digested. A good record, though."
4,old school with a new twist!,"Musk was very big (almost too big) in the 1970's. some of it was quite nasty. The Bod Fresh blue musk is a lighter fragrance, but sticks with you through the day. I am quite sensitive to many perfumes/scents and this one is just right. Every time I wear it, I get positive compliments from women - women who usually dont say anything, even if I am wearing something really expensive and nice. Overall, I highly recommend this brand and scent!"
5,Beautiful book about a beautiful person,Kept my interest from start to finish. I always knew he was a wonderful person; this confirms it.Such determination and success at arriving at his goal.I ansiously await his new chapters in life. He is an inspiration to me. I am a senior citizen and hope to live long enough to see many chapters.May God hold him in His hands always.
1,Totally unreliable. Don't be lured by the price tag.,"Worked perfectly undisturbed in my workstation for a few months until it started failing transfers, and ultimately becoming completely unreadable. Was horrified to find out common experiences from other people online. Stay away from this item-- better yet from this manufacturer."
2,dont store valuables on this,"Both of my LaCie Big Disk Extremes have been returned to manufacturer within a year of purchase due to power issues. In each case I have lost time and valuable data (they reformat the drive after repair as stardard operating procedure). Lacie makes decent drives so this surprised me. Later models may have fixed the problem, but the LaCie Big Disk Extreme has issues."
1,"Terrible product, lid does not close right and it drips.","Spend a few extra bucks for a 'professional quality' queue bottle. I put olive oil in the first one and it dropped all over the counter, avoid at al cost."
4,It works best over rough terrain,"The other review says it is hard to pull them across the wacky track. This is true. However this wacky track works really well when you are attempting to build a track on the floor and over a rug. It is the only track that deals well with rugs or other things that make the terrain less than perfectly flat. Also I would say its well made becuase there is a steel cable connecting all the pieces.Finally this track is a very good ""problem solver"" when you can't quite get all the track to fit together putting this Wacky track down can really save the day. IMHO it is rather expensive."
3,Good movie,"This is a good movie, Elijah gives a great performance! As well as the others in this film! I recommend seeing it."
3,A Preposterous Story Redeemed by Good Acting,"Okay, the script to this movie often falls into pure absurdity, and the ending is ridiculous. However, this does not mean that Radio Flyer is bad or unwatchable, for any weakness in the script is transcended by the beautiful chemistry of Joseph Mazzello and Elijah Wood. As brothers, the two are magnetic, believable, and completely irresistible. They give the film its heart, and had any other young actors appeared in their place, the picture would have failed miserably. But to watch these two young actors at work is a truly mezmerizing experience. Wood is quite effective as the eldest brother, but Mazzello is nothing less than extraordinary in his first principal role. To this day, he remains one of Hollywood's most underated talents."
3,Ok movie,My husband wanted this movie because he watched it as a boy. The DVD arrived on time and in great condition. I was bored with the movie though.
2,I wanted so much to like it!,"A friend who works at a groovy pharmacy gave me this book and I turned to it for help when I was struggling postpartum. Unfortunately, Robin only seems to address the health of women who are already perfectly healthy. If you're looking for advice on how overcome complications or illness postpartum, this book may not help. In fact, her assertions that the stomach will return to its normal size in 6 weeks, or that new moms don't get sick because of all the love they experience for their baby made me feel bad--and my sense of self is usually pretty robust."
5,"THROWBACK THEATER: While the world had Quincy Jones, R&B kept Norman Connors on the side.","For real, this was a wonderful compilation of music from a master of the fusion of funk, R&B and jazz! I had forgotten some of these songs and the ones that I remembered still sounded as if they were created for me yesterday. Everyone loves the way that Quincy put it down, because he is a master of the music fusion thing, however, he wasn't the only one. Norman did his thing throughout his career and he did it very well, his accolades just weren't as widely known. This selections of his greatest hits will only prove that he knew his craft and mastered it to a ""T""."
4,Good,"The book's quite what you'd expect after reading the volume 1 - ""SPQR"". (And if you haven't read that book, don't even think of reading this one!) You'll meet the same old Decius Caecilius Metellus struggling with complicated intrigues in the capital of the world - Rome.This volume was a bit disappointing when I read it for the first time. (Yet, it got much better with the second try.) It's not as good as ""SPQR"", but, of course, the latter is nearly impossible to beat. But to look at the bright side, I'd like to mention that this time, Decius is not acting as stupidly as in the first volume. Besides, you might be pleasantly surprised to discover some new things about him that you wouldn't have guessed before.If you loved ""SPQR"", read this book and the following ones, too."
2,Looks great. Doesn't run great.,I bought two of the Men's Invicta's recently from Amazon. Different models but both had very similar characteristics. They look absolutely great. Very solid. They don't run great. Will lose time daily and if you take it off for more than 8-10 hours they stop. You'll end up re-setting date and time a lot with this watch. Major disappointment as my last self-winder would run for a couple days without my wearing it.
2,Pretty Disappointing,I found this cd to be a let down. I wish I had looked at this website before purchasing. I wouldn't have missed anything. I have bought earlier compilations and I was very pleased. This one left much to be desired. I found a few songs that I liked but not nearly as much as usual. I don't feel I got my money's worth. WOW should apologize to us for having us waste our money.
1,Worst CD they ever put out.,This has to be the worst gospel CD that they ever put out. The song selection is of poor choice. It seems that they just threw something together at the last minute. The songs are mostly traditional gospel but even those are not as up to par as the earlier CD. It is no where near as inspirational as 1998 CD nor did it stir my soul like the 1999 CD. It seems that they are going downhill every year. Don't waste your money.
1,Disappointing at best!,"This does not represent the great work of 2002! For at least three years I looked forward to this CD set. Now, I'm certain that I won't purchase the 2003 CD (or any future WOW CDs) on the merits of any previous compilations. What happened?Perhaps it's time another label emerged and pulled together a truly quality effort. While the songs are all excellent, they don't represent the artists' work in 2002. Or perhaps I have this wrong...maybe this is just a compilation of previous work that is just RELEASED in 2002.Not at all what I expected."
2,Flawed and consequently disappointing,"A potentially interesting and highly important book which was spoiled for me by Miller's insistence that autism is caused by cruel and unloving parents (a view contradicted by exhaustive research). This flaw seemed to cast doubt on the rest of the book, as Miller would seem to be contradicting her own principles by ignoring the testimony of high-functioning people with autism themselves who have spoken out vociferously against this view and by treating the traumatic and pointless method of ""holding therapy"" as a miracle cure.Society badly needs to wake up to the issue of child abuse (emotional as well as physical), but this cause is hindered not helped by claiming as a product of abuse one of the disorders which has been most conclusively shown to be neurological."
5,Lo mejor! (The best!),"I love a good cup of coffee. I have had pure Kona coffee, pure Colombian, Kenyan, etc. Cafe Britt is by far the best. The regular blend is beyond superb, but even the decaf is excellent. It is better than any other decaf I have ever had. It is smooth with no bite and it tastes better and costs much less than what I used to pay for Kona (over $25 per bag). I have also given this as gifts and everyone loves it."
1,DD,"With the exception of the one-Line : ""You should have stuck to Mast**8ating "" ,and one big breasted bimbo, other than that,even the hideous (they were ugly before they became monsters) strippers with no bodies and flat butts/chest would not save the movie, Just a dusk til dawn type movie but WORST."
4,colorful sound,"The sound of this recording is colorful. I especcialy like the last part of this cd. It does not really move me, but the sound is rich and colourfull. Perhaps it is the conductor, but the brass sure does its job. Evereything on this cd is like a fairy tale. What are the difference between Antar and this symphonie? It can easily be compared with shererazade. The 4 stars are earned because the music is not very original and because the symphonie and the first fairy tale do not come out right/refreshing. For sound quality this is a best buy."
3,Light scribe works some of the time,It writes cds and dvds quickly but the light scribe does not work well. It takes numerous attempts to light scribe. The last four attempts have failed. I chose this model for the light scribe feature - disappointing.
1,Not the best quality...,"Within a week this clasps on this thing broke off. It was really difficult to close anyway, but now it's broken. :/"
3,Great for keeping cigars safe.,"This works well but:1) kind of heavy2) larger and harder to store in bag than the leather cases3) the included humidor doesn't hold liquid and is not worth using.Only buy as a transport. Wish it had some storage for a cutter (sleeve or pouch) as if this is not full, the cigars roll around and can become damaged."
5,The exemplification of beautiful music,"This is one of the best if not the best instrumental movie scores ever! The only soundtrack that can equal the ""Godfather"" is ""Star Wars."" The Love Theme is a beautiful song and every time I hear it, I think of the scene in the movie where Pacino is walking in the mountains of Sicily."
5,My favorite,I loved the movie (movies) and have wanted the sound track for a long time. Now I have this CD and really like listening to it.
5,The Best Kettle Cover,An excellent cover made of heavy high quality vinyl with elastic to hold the cover on the Weber in a wind. Works perfectly.
2,I wouldn't own the grill without the cover,"Durable, fits well, protects well, looks great. I wouldn't own the grill without the cover."
5,"Weber Kettle Cover 22-1/2""",Cover has a very nice weight and a snug fit. Satisfied with the purchase.
1,Not with a Laser mouse,Doesnt work with a laser mouse. And this is the lightest one they make. The tech support was nice though. And the material is great and the product looks great.
1,SPONGEBOB HATES ME TOO!,"We had to return the SpongeBob toy also because it did say I HATE YOU! Anyone who thinks it's saying I SHAKE YOU needs to use a Q-TIP or get their hearing checked. We did not know that's what it said until we got the toy home...if we would've known that the toy said I HATE YOU, we obviously would not have bought it for our child. Unlike some parents, we care about what our children are exposed to. Also, we have no reason to sue anyone...there's too many frivilous lawsuits in America...we just won't let our kids have that toy."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!,"I had purchased this phone 1 1/2 year ago and then all of the sudden one day, they didn't work. We could get no dial tone. I called the customer service number which instructed me to do a few things ( take batteries out, unplug the main unit, etc) and nothing worked. She then concluded that the base was broken and because it was greater than one year I'd have to purchase another one for $120! I spent over $300 because We had 4 phones total and it stops working after a year!I recently bought the V-tech phone and love it so far! The quality is much better and has nicer features. I like how the name of the person calling and the number appear at the same time unlike the Siemens phone.Siemens customer serivce was not helpful and their products are not worth the money you spend for them."
2,Faulty call log feature,"The call log feature of this phone worked unpredictably. Sometimes, calls from a particular number would be logged, while other times, calls from the same caller would fail to appear in the log. Siemens recommended that I replace the base unit, which I did. This failed to correct the problem. They recommended replacing the base unit again. Instead, I just returned the whole phone system. In addition to the call log problems, the phone also often made an unusual clicking noise during telephone conversations.Amazon[.com] was extremely helpful throughout this whole process and I give Amazon[.com] five stars for their customer service. Unfortunately, I wish I could say the same for the Siemens phone."
1,Piece of junk,"Had this phone for about 2 years now and it has been nothing but trouble. I had to reboot it at least 4 times and then, finally, it just died. Avoid."
1,Poor sound quality,"This phone has lots of bells and whistles. but did not perform the basic function of a clear connection. I thought that maybe it would get better with different weather, but for two days there was a background hiss. I returned it. Would not recommend this to anyone."
1,"Ineffective, Fault-Prone Technology","I bought a Siemens Gigaset 4015 and several 4000 handsets a year ago, and have had nothing but trouble with them. They cut off phone calls in mid-conversation, and are so unreliable, I can no longer use them. I've called Siemens Technical Support multiple times, and am given useless troubleshooting tips. What's been my solution? I bought an inexpensive AT&T cordless phone from my local drugstore, and it works like a charm. The low $ AT&T phone beats the higher $$$ Siemens phones hands down. I don't buy all the excuses that try to make up for the Siemens cordless products' faults -- my AT&T cordless works like a champ in a home that has a wireless network, where I use my microwave, and where I do all the other everyday things a good phone should be able to handle."
3,Wireless netwoking problems,"Last year I purchased the Siemens 2420 model and started encountering static problems so bad I could not use the supplementary handset. The base unit still worked fine on the 2040 unit. I wanted to upgrade so last week I purchased the 4015 model. I encountered the same problem after a few days of use. I think it is the wireless network in my house but when I shut down the network the problem still exists. I personally liked the new 4015 model better than the 2420 model. The feel of the handset is better and the features are easier to configure. Since the problem still exists, I returned the phone today and i'm still looking for a solution. I may have to go back to a 900mhz unit."
2,Get Real?,"Rachael Ray's ""30-Minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy without going to extremes"" is the daytime diva's attempt to capitalize on the success of various diets- the Sonoma Diet, Bob Greene's Best Life Diet, the Hallelujah Diet,and so on. She tries to make ""healthy"" meals fit into her 30 minute format. As usual, there are weird combinations, few pictures of the completed meals, little nutritional information, and a confusing layout.For Ray,getting health means going ""low-carb."" Plenty of meat,such as in the ""no-sagna"",and limited pasta,most of it wheat (yuck!) There is an overload of cheese and meat. One can feel one's arteries clog simply by reading the recipes. It's enough to make one a vegan.When it comes to healthy cooking, I'd recommend Mark Reinfeld's cookbook for the Blossoming Lotus Cafe, Terces Engelhart's ""I am grateful"",Troth Wells' ""The World in Your Kitchen"" and the late Linda McCartney's ""On Tour."""
1,specialized ingredients add to meal prep time,"Love Rachael on tv. Bought this book for my son who is a single father. After he opened it Christmas a.m. I was disappointed to see that each meal would take a trip to the store for expensive, specialized ingredients. I think the title is misleading altho I am sure the meals would be delicious."
2,dissapointing,"I love watching Rachael on TV, and I love to say EVOO, mostly because it bothers my boyfriend when I do. However, I found this cookbook boring. I am a simple cook and don't like fish and I don't dine on swine! I go more for chicken and steak type of thing. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the book. For one it is paper back, and I like glossy colored pictures. I will remain optimistic though, and try a different cookbook of hers just because she is so likeable and the stuff seen on tv looks good. Even though she says that it is stuff you would have in your pantry, I don't (and I have a lot of stuff) I have read that she has a new publisher than what this one was with, and it have the glossy pics and a better qualiy."
2,Very Disappointed,"I did not make anything from this cookbook yet. As I flipped through the pages, nothing really made me want to make any of these dishes. I was very dissapointed for three main reasons: 1. It lists a lot of ingredients (simple, easy to find ingredients is what I need); 2. It does not list the nutritional information that most cookbooks now have; and 3. Where are the pictures?"
3,This wan't for me,I had high hopes for this cook book because I used some of her recipes downloaded from the internet and loved them. I just didn't care for these recipes and there aren't any nutrition information labels for them. I paid so little for the book that I gave it an OK rating. I might use one or two recipes out if this whole book.
3,Needs more info for low-carber,"This book has great recipes and they do seem very easy and quick. Just one complaint, as a low-carber, I need to know the number of carbs each meal has. Whether or not it is truly low-carb isn't the issue...the issue is it would be nice to knokw how many are in each dish!"
5,great book,this is a great book to have if you are looking for quick good meal. I use it on a regular basics and haven't been disappointed as yet. the recipes are very good and very simple.I also bought simple and simply delicious by sylvie rocher.I just love those 2 books
4,Sensibly Lower Carb,"Thankfully this is a sensibly lower carb, not a practically no carb book of recipes. I am not a fanatic about the low carb craze, so these dishes really hit the spot. I really like the soups, and the Italian dishes with lower carb options such as squash. Overall I like Rachaels cookbooks because of her liking for taste over pretentiousness, and ingredients I can usually find at my regular market. The presentation and readability has also improved from her previous releases, which is a big plus when you are rushing around the kitchen."
2,Rachel Ray 30 minute get real meals:eat healthy without going to extremes,"I bought this book b/c I thought it would give me some ideas how to make healthy meals easy. Wrong! A lot of the ingredients are things that I don't even know where to purchase the items (i.e Hungarian Paprika). Also, it is very ""No Carb""--so it seems very dated. She doesn't seem to worry about fat, sodium, etc--just carbs. She also has some very complicated instructions that may take her 30 minutes, but will take the average person a lot longer."
1,Miyu turned commercial,"I loathed this rendition of this beautiful series. This is a waste of time and money, the art is lazy and sloppy, the characters are totally lost in the awful dialogue. I felt like I was watching a version of pokemon, the defeated character at the end of each episode...wtf ?! Did they make this series to just sell dolls and t shirts? It is awful!!!! I bought all of them and could barely sit through these. Read the mangas and watch the original 4 episode OAV. The original 4 episodes capture the truly macabre and enigmatic nature of this work without any frills. The story is just beautiful and this dvd set is just a waste of plastic."
4,The best book available on this subject,"The book does a fantastic job of covering orchestration basics, including some great suggestions on how to combine various instruments to create various moods. It also covers numerous details on how to sell the orchestral illusion as well as possible using whatever tools you have available.Recommended"
4,An Interesting Interpretation,"This retelling of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was easy to follow and pretty true to the original novel. The art was simple but very modern and beautiful to look at. The characters were well developed, but quickly introduced. You meet all three of Dorothy's friends within the first thirty pages or so.Well done and fun to look at, this graphic novel makes a great addition to any Oz collector's book shelf."
3,"box broke quickly, products were great",The carrying case didn't hold up well at all. But the products were wonderful to have on hand and were overall a good deal for the price.
4,Heart-warming Novel,This is a definite improvement over Temperature Rising. This is a beautiful against all-odds love story. You will have a definite love-hate relationship with the characters. But you will love it anyway.
1,The Great Pretender,"Back when this piece of dreck first appeared, people were all up in arms. In the end, bankruptcy DID come--for Harry Figgie, who lost his company."
3,Expecting better,"I purchased this DVD, waiting for it for about a month, and expecting a big show of those 70's legends. Big names and excepcional songs. But when I watch the show, I feel that those great bands performed lightly with certain exceptions like John Kay & Steppewolf, and Rare Earth. The singer of Iron Butterfly was surely out of tune when singing their hit In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. I think Christopher Cross becomes too old to perform on public, except for those beautiful girls on Drums and Keyboard.This DVD could be better produced."
2,"cute, but cord way too long","These are cute and comfortable, but the cord is way longer than it needs to be to reach any gizmo you're holding, sitting next to, or have in your pocket. The cord's so long I've accidentally kneeled on it and pulled the earbuds straight out of my ears. So that's not cool.The other problem is that if you jiggle or twist the jack, the sound cuts in and out and gets all fuzzy. The earbuds that came with my mp3 player didn't do that."
1,Garbage,Please save your money as well as an ounce of garbage in our overcrowded landfills.Spend a little more and you can do alot better.I bought these for my daughter in August. In September the left channel went out. She could hear both channels if she set her unit on the desk a certain way.She was listening to it today and now both channels are out.Save your money! Don't buy these!If I could rate these -5 I would. Nice looking yes. Extremely cheap yes yes yes!
3,A good start...,"The sexual scenes in this book were VERY hot, but not enough of them. The story was good but there was something missing. I think the ""missing"" thing is just experience. Naija has great potential but this story did jump all over the place and certain things just worked out too well (perfect)to seem real.That being said... if you want a sexual story that will keep you reading then get this one. It's VERY fast reading if you don't keep reading the sexual parts! :-) I'll definately be getting her next one."
1,Too Weak. A Poor Imitation,I bought this book thinking I was getting a hot urban treat. It was just a poor marketing play on another authors words and the story wasn't urban or erotic. The characters put me to sleep for four nights before I gave up because nothing they did made me turn the pages. Why Naija or any other would steal another author's words and try to make them their own is a mystery. I had a feeling I had read something like her prologue before and my friend and I figured it out. We read this whole have you ever sequence in a real urban erotic tale and this one is a weak fake. Don't waste your money. Read Zane or somebody who actually writes using their own words and creativity. Between My Thighs was more like mop the floor and watch it dry.
5,The Show Brought Home,"This DVD is a must for not just any Sammy fan, but for anyone thats into cranking the volume and jamming to an awesome show. The Red Rocker brings it for over 2 hours on this DVD and captures the enthusiasm and energy of one of his shows. I've seen the man play live twice and have been just a few rows from front row, and Sammy puts on one helluva show! Granted, live is always going to be better than a DVD, but this is as good as it gets as far as bringing the show home! The interview on Disc 2 is great and so is the inside look at Sammy's club. Simply put, buy this DVD. 3+ hours of rock at its finest."
5,Two disc Birthbash tour.,I thought this was a great two disc set. Only one way to rock lets you see some of sammys guitar playing up close. And his I can drive 55 is always good. I think that the best way to enjoy this album is to have a stereo TV and turn it up. Lot good looking women too! His personal interview shows what a good guy he is. Not many left like Sammy....
5,Nobody does it better!,"DVD concert of the century! Nobody rocks better than Sammy. This is a must for all fans of music. The Red Rocker is timeless. Sammy's repertoire of material speaks for itself in this performance. Sorry DLR, this stuff is way out of your league!!! I loved Van Halen but the solo material is so much more passionate and real. The Waboritas are without question his best band. Vic Johnson is soooo cool. It would have been nice to see ""3 In The Middle"" included, but nevertheless this concert shreds! Non-stop entertainment, rock's greatest voice, oldest teenager, and coolest frontman. Sit back, grab some tequila, and enjoy over 2 hours of pure rock and roll bliss. You won't be disappointed. The interview disc is very enjoyable also. Cheers."
4,nice ...,these shoes r really nice and commfortable for day to day gym activities and since they look good too u can wear them anywhere wid casual clothes too
2,cheap shoes for cheap price..,"Upon receiving these shoes, I found out a little more about the shoes. My major problem with these shoes is the bottoms of the shoes have lots of dull little rubber spikes on them, so they pick up dirt, mud, and just about anything that you step in so that you have to pry it out with a stick in order to remove it. If you only use them on concrete, they would be a good shoe, i suppose, but for anything else, it's to much of a hassle unless you dont mind mud all over the floor. On the plus side they are comforable and very easy to take on and off. My advise is to spend an extra ten or twenty bucks to get a different brand."
2,Feh!,"Christgau's Record Guides used to have value, in large part because they were informative and he wrote like he actually enjoyed his reviewing job. Not this time. This time he takes the lazy way out with all of his new ratings symbols, and his writing smacks of someone who finds listening to all of this stuff beneath him. Maybe he still does get a charge from it, but you'd never be able to tell from his condescending prose. It's time for him to pack it in."
2,Alan Ladd,I enjoy looking at the acting of Alan Ladd. I was hoping this movie would be a sleeper as I recently discovered an early Ladd that transfixed me. This didn't and was boring.
1,Terrible taste to me - hope I can give them away,"Have used other Spry products and like them. This just has an awful taste to me. will bring them in to work and hope that someone else might like them. Each to his own. This was a real ""yuk"" for me."
5,Really attractive,"The mouse rug I bought is really attractive & very unusual. The mouse moves over the pad with a little more difficulty than it would with another mousepad, but it is worth it. The woven rug is a thin layer on top of a normal rubber backing, and it might wear through more quickly than a regular mousepad, but I have yet to find out. Delivery of this item was prompt & hassle free."
5,Tracks:,TRACKS: The City / Tramp and the Young Girl / One Way Sunday / The Ghetto / Song for You / Friends / Solitude.
3,"Interesting thesis, so-so execution","This book is a half-humorous argument that Elvis worship is, in many ways, very similar to organised religion - specifically Christianity. It's an interesting idea, to be sure, but the problem is that with all the other great books about Elvis' afterlife out there (I like Greil Marcus' one), once the thesis is stated the argument seems a little irrelevant. Still, what's there is well-researched and there are a few tidbits you might not find elsewhere. 'Who Did He Say That He Was?' is my favourite chapter, focusing on what Elvis himself believed about religion and his place in it.For Elvis fans, kitsch collectors, and people who want to start their own religion."
5,GREAT REFERENCE,I really love this book...perfect when you want a quick reference regarding conventions and how to use them. I bought it as a used book so it was super reasonable...
5,Couldn't be better!,"Modern Bridge ConventionsI was delighted with this purchase. A very fair price, very quick delivery, and the product, though supposedly used, was in mint condition."
3,Broke 1st day!,"Though My Grandson liked the Gear set, I was disapointed with the plastic posts on the set! How can He enjoy exploring how gears work when the posts that hold gears break off so easily? Great idea but weak parts...."
5,The Oliver Sacks segment,"Sacks comes to talk about his new book on the Island of the Colorblind. This is the island in which one out of twelve people are colorblind. The general average for mankind is one out of forty- thousand. Sacks explains that the inability to see color does not make a major difference in the lives of the islanders. He also talks about his own work in general, and about his fondness for 'islands' for closed communal worlds. His intelligence and modesty pervade the conversation. Paradoxically however his politeness and hesitation make him in person a somewhat less impressive figure than he is 'on the page'."
4,A Good Read!,"If you're in middle management or aspire to be, Lisa Haneberg's book is a must read. It is practicality incarnate. Haneberg helpfully explains specific ways to be more productive and offers techniques to help your employees become focused, fulfilled and fruitful. Her energetic book codifies the steps you should take to grow into middle management, shine and advance to upper management. Along the way, you'll learn how to improve your organization, identify trouble spots and implement changes in your corporate culture. We can envision this book as a part of a college management curriculum or of any firm's ongoing middle management development program. It's practical, lively and thorough. If you want to be sure you've got a good grip on management from the middle, read on."
2,Smell is too strong,I had to wake up in the middle of the night to rinse this off because the smell aggravated my nose. I'm now taking allergy medicine.
1,Awful Medicinal Smell,"I ordered this product to replenish supply purchased from a store about 2.5 hrs away. The product purchased from the store was wonderful, great consistency and smell. The product ordered from this site had an awful medicinal smell...almost made me gag and nothing like my original even though labeled to be the same. I was very disappointed and will not purchase again."
4,Just received the bottle.,"The ingredients appear to be all natural and great. The smell is not what I associate with a typical Cocoa Butter cream (to me it usually smells like chocolate). The smell of this lotion is what I can best describe as clean and fresh:). I personally prefer the smell of this bottle for me. It is just a personal preference though.I am giving a four instead of a five stars because the lotion doesn't soak in as well as others. That being said, I think I will continue to use this as my heavy moisturiser because the ingredients are all natural and I like the Nubian Heritage company.In a side note, I am obssessed with their Olive Butter soap. I think all of their soaps are amazing."
3,Good book for the details,"This is a good book for getting started with Machinima. It has a lot of detail on creating Machinima with Machinimation and Unreal. This will get you started with two of the popular machinima game engines and get you familiar with the basics and quite a bit of the detail work.This really is a how to book. If you just want to learn more about Machinima then look at some of the other titles before settling on this book, though it's introduction to Machinima will give you a good overview."
2,Not What I Expected,"It didn't look as nice as it did in the picture. Kind of junky looking. Hard to set, and I never could get the nature sounds to work. The volume knob was very hard to turn. Also the light was way to bright to sleep with . Very unsastisfied."
4,"Has many holes, but still worth it","Since it's the only baseball game on N64 this year, I can still recommend this game to baseball fans. But there are many, many holes. For instance, since pushing any button after the play ""ends"" automatically takes you to the next batter, it often doesn't let you tag from third on a fly ball. The slow fielders make it nearly impossible to turn a double play in the infield, as fielders stop when you throw the ball to them. Roster control is extremely difficult in season mode, since you can only make moves involving your own team, which is why Anaheim is stuck with Kent Bottenfield at center. And the outfields just seem huge. It is a fun game to play if you can look past these problems, which isn't as tough as it sounds like it would be."
1,this game looks like all star baseball 1923,very bad game i hate it very much it is very boring and the graphics looks like snes ones
3,"The more things change, the more they stay the same","Don't be fooled, this is All Star Baseball 2000 with an Legends team, a couple of new ballparks, and a ""field of dreams"" stadium. If you bought ASB 2000, just play that. The commentary is exactly the same as is the gameplay. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun, but I expected acclaim to give me a little more bang for my buck."
4,Great career retrospective,"One of the true Queens of Rock and Roll performing many of her greatest hits in full versions wth a powerful band. Her voice is prominent throughout - perhaps a little more band might have helped, but it's not an issue because she is singing well.She pays tribute to other legends such as Bessie Smith (St. Lous Blues); Esther Phillips (What A Difference A Day Made); Patti Page (Tennessee Waltz). Her workouts on her own recent Broadway-related material, also beg return spins.The band is tight and strong; background voices mixed nicely, especially on See See Rider and a lesser-discussed nugget, Play It Fair (she also recut it Brunwick in the late '60s); ad they show no signs of slowing on the rousing finale, Saved."
3,Short Vs. Long Covers,This is a good cover for the summer or for much use. In the winter there is a tendency for the cover to be blown off in high winds but it is much easier to remove from the grill. The Weber 9856 Genesis Silver B Grill Cover is a very good short cover.
1,Just As Bad As HARDCORE REVOLUTION,"The title of this review says it all. The makers of the first ECW game didn't learn from their mistakes. This is just as (bad) as Hardcore Revolution. In fact, it's basically the same (darn) game! Avoid this game like the plague!"
1,Do not buy this toy - it doesn't last long.,"We bought this toy for our daughter for Christmas but since she had a bunch of other toys, we held off giving it to her until a month later. The toy worked for 1 week and then only the red on/off light would stay lit up but it wouldn't talk or do any of the functions. We made sure the batteries were good too so it wasn't an issue with them. Way too expensive to be spending money on a toy that doesn't last. Go with the lower cost options or use colorful workbooks and save yourself the hassle."
1,Horrible Product,"I purchased this item with the intent to teach my child how to tell time, needless to say the talking part was unclear so you could not understand some of the things it says and also, it was telling us the wrong time. Even my child was disappointed with this product. Now i have to return this product and ship it back.. what a pain !"
4,"Very good collection, BUT...","...you should FIRST get ""The Legendary Modern Recordings 1948-1954"". This is ""Hook"" as he was when first came out of Detroit in 1947-48. Absolutely essential records for blues fans!"
2,Patently boring language and arguably redundant vocab,Blakie needs to learn a few new words. Patently and arguably were so over-used that I dreaded turning the pages of what is an OK story.
3,A good collection of snippets.,"I have to admit I bought this CD set mainly for Winston Churchills ""Darkest Hour"" speech,then thought ""Hey I could get all sorts of great speeches at once. All the speeches are pretty impressive and some of them are a little creepy to hear. I mean to ""HEAR"" a President talk about the ""Indians"" when they were still living on the plains and in the mountains of America is just strange.Some of the speeches are complete, however Churchills ""Darkest Hour"" was not one of them. Over all it was a great collection, but I wish that some of the speeches had not been trunkated. You might look for a CD that more accurately targets what you're looking for than trying to get a one stop shop with this set."
3,Tropic,"Sent the wrong size. I paid for the larger. Tried to rectify. Again, the wrong size. Good communication. Packaging was fine."
3,I like the creme version better,"I am a fan of NARS creme eye shadow and am a bit disappointed with the powder version. Color is fine, nice neutral, everyday color but I need to wear eyeshadow base to make it work."
2,not bad if you can't write a mechanism...,"Basically, all this book does is draw mechanisms for a whole bunch of name reactions. It doesn't really tell you all that much and only gives one example (for which the mechanism is drawn out)or each. Definately not recomended if you know how to push arrows and write a mechanism. Not at all what I was expecting."
5,Kitchen toys that aren't PINK!,"My son played at a friends house with their little girls. He had a blast with their tea set. He also loves to ""help"" in the kitchen and had stolen a number of small bowls and spoons to make pretend food in. I wanted to get him a play cooking set that included a tea set and wasn't pink. This one fists both and has a lot of great components. A pretend juicer, cookie cuters and rolling pin. Great buy."
5,Kitchen set,Bought this set for our 3 year grandson for Christmas. He loves it and plays with it all the time. Great for dramatic play! He makes his nana and mommy cups of tea and lunches which nurtures his interactive play and language developmnent.
2,Houses? Babies?? Say it isn't so.,"I can't use a domesticated Raylan. Introducing a baby is generally a jump the shark moment. Sure hope that's not the case here, but it ain't lookin' good."
5,Love Justified!,I enjoy the series Justified. Timothy Olyphant plays the part perfectly. I was so excited to get the Third Season release and look forward to Season 4.
2,defective blu rays,"I do buy a lot of DVDs thru Amazon - but I got this new blu ray (Justified Season 3) at Target. I have returned 3 copies - so far. All are defective & the menu is un-cooperative. All I can do is press play - arrows, etc., do not work & much of the text on the menu isn't viewable. My friend experienced the same thing with this blu ray.I wasn't that thrilled with this season either - as many have mentioned - extremely violent, not as funny as previous seasons & less likable characters.Will never buy another TV series in blu ray from any company."
4,Another great Season of Justified,"As usual, Justified Season 3 doesn't disappoint. Buying through Amazon was simple and the instant stream played easily. Happy happy with the purchase, but sad about waiting for season 4!"
2,Disappointed but hopeful,Let me start by saying Justified is my favorite show on TV. I was disapointed in the season premiere because it feel into the category of every other cop show on tv by being mostly set in bigger cities. TO me the thing that seperated Justified was that added element and rural feel to the show sort of like Walker Texas Ranger had at one time. I mean how many city cop shows are on today. I loved season 2 more than season 1 because the focus on the Bennetts gave that season something different that no other show has. It just seems to me that the writers are focusing more on Frankfort and LExington and not on Harlan and E ky or at least that is the feel i got from the 1st episode. Hope i AM wrong but i will be watching either way.
5,Great Series !!,I have been watching every series since it started & also watched Timothy Olyphant in the Deadwood series.I think He's a great actor. His role in both series as a Marshal is awesome!I'll be getting the entire run of series for as long as it runs :)
5,Brilliant,"It just keeps getting better. The first episode of Season 3 is a classic. So many great characters, and the dry humour is always bubbling away."
1,NOT for the Performer Grill,BEWARE - Amazon lists this cover with the Weber Performer grill. It does NOT fit the 2006 Performer and should NOT be purchased together.
1,Fine product but,"The grill cover is shown and linked with the wrong grill It didn't fit when I got it, and now I probably have to pay to return it. I ordered another cover, and it fit perfectly.The rating is for the Amazon site, not the cover. Make sure your grill matches up with cover."
1,Doesn't Fit!,I had the same problem as Richard Harvey. This cover is just too small for my Performer.
3,Weber Grill Cover,"Does the job, however, it may have been designed a little better so as not to have a water collection when it rains."
5,Weber cover FITS!,"After searching for a cover that truly fits our older one-touch Weber, and after purchasing two that came and did not fit, we finally got one. It was delivered quickly and it fits! We are delighted and thank Amazon for carrying the link that connected us to the product."
5,Good book,"I have bought many books that teaches Java and none of them work for me. They all are overloaded with not very helpful information.I like the language of this book and the way they explain things. Sometimes, I wish they give more examples but overall it's a great book especially for people who have little to medium knowledge of Java."
4,Good books to understand,this is a very good book. It gives you a very solid understanding of object oriented programming world. I have done first 5 chapters . I feel good about java.
2,Not for beginners and not for experienced programmers either,"I have programmed before, so it wasn't much of a problem, but this book didn't explain anything about basic sytax, how programming works, or even what a variable was. It was almost like the book expected that you had extensive experience in another programming language such as c++. It barley explained the idea of OO programming before diving in ""head first""At the same time, the book frustrated me. After skipping the basics it went very slowly. Basically, it acted like you knew all the basics of programming at the start and then like you were a complete beginner latter. I wish it was more fact than all this fluff. Fluff would be good for a beginners book, which we already established this isn't, and so it really serves no purpose. Over all, I am disappointed with this purchase.I would rate one star, but at the end of the book I had an idea of the basics of Java, which is what I bought it for."
2,Not that good.,"For every topic in this book, you have to go find some other source and do some more reading.Inner classes, a total of 10 lines and some funny pictures ?Yeah, thanks for helping me learn Java by making me curios what Inner Classes really are..This just goes for everything else.. Events, Listeners, Initialization...And this book omits the most important parts, but talks about MIDI for pages and pages ? Really ? MIDI ?And the book repeats itself a lot. The same text block is printed twice on the same page, and again after 3 pages..Lion images, yeah cool. The book itself: BO-RING!"
5,Great Book,I looked at a lot of java books at amazon and based on the reviews I picked this one. I was very happy with my choice. It covers a lot of material and is a very easy to read. I think based on my experiences with this book I will try other head first books.
4,Gets you started,"This book, as well as series, goes a long way to helping you learn. The concepts may not always be well enough explained. However, this is understandable is it is apparent that the collaborative authors seem to do all that they can to make the teaching and learning of the concepts fun.I would highly recommend this book to any one who is just getting started with programming. I tried to learn Java through a number of other teach myself methods. It was not until I read Head First Java that I actually got it. Since then, I have moved on to more advanced concepts and have had a lot of fun with coding. Unfortunately, most books that deal with teaching development read like someone's thesis. Bates and Sierra have provided a book that is not only a very effective teaching tool but also a whole lot of fun to read. I wish all cerebral subjects were taught this way. If you like fooling around in the library, then you will love Head First Java and the Head First series!"
1,Only for People who have NEVER programmed an OO program,"While I loved Head First Design Patterns, this book was a disappointment. From all the reviews and my experience with the HFDP book, I had high expectations.If you have ever written an OO program then this book is not for you.I know all the reviews are glowing about how fun it presents material--and it is fun--but the substance of the JAVA training is weak at best. There are many other better Java books.Move on to the next one."
4,Newbies recommended book - Stater!,"Well...this book is very perfect for those newbies who want to really gain understanding in Java. Sierra and Bates are just awesome in detailing the theory of Java. They both know how to make Java looked a little bit chilled. If my suggestion is allowed, I would really suggest them to write more codes in their book. Somehow, their theory is great, but I feel programming needs more example to foster our understanding and experience on the codes. Overall, this book is RECOMMENDED for OO Java programming."
1,not for non-programmers,"If you already know programming, or you're happy with being given vague hints of what things do rather than an organized explanation, this might a fine text for learning Java. This book throws language features at you, without following any of them up with discussion when or why you might want to use certain features. So if you don't want the book's first programs to include all of: variables, loops, method calls, and boolean values all one one page (with only sporadic re-visitations to the topic), then another text might be better for you.To its credit, this book does manage to present the material in a way unlike any other, which can appeal to certain learning styles."
4,HARD CORE BURROUGHS !!!,"This is a collection of short Burroughs pieces from various ""little mags...Burroughs' principal literary output between 1962 and 1969 appeared in these obscure places, and most of the pieces collected in The Burroughs File date from that period"". The writing drifts from being utterly petrifying to...what the hell is this? ""VERTIGO OF DEAD LANGUAGES THE PULLEY AND THE COMPASS LAGOONS OF MURDEROUS SLEEP-(THEY SHARED THE salmon)-HEAVY STICKY NIGHTS INKY CLOUDS HAUNTING SHADOWS COMPASS DRIPPING GEOMETRY"". If you're up for it it can blow your mind, but if you've never read Burroughs before LEAVE THE BUILDING NOW! And even if you have, make sure one of those books is one of the cut-up trilogy--I'd recommend Nova Express.This book also contains photocopies of pages from his scrapbooks, and a couple essays on Burroughs."
5,A classic Kinks album,"State Of Confusion reflected Ray's state of mind at the time. In the process of breaking up with Chrissie Hynder, butting heads with Dave and somewhat despondent Ray produced one of his best albums. Although not quite up to the level of the underrated Word Of Mouth, this was one of the best albums produced by the band during the latter part of their career.The last album to feature long time member Mick Avory, SOC features a tight rhythm section and some of the tighest playing the band ever put to record. Highly recommended."
2,"Two good tracks, and a bunch of Noise","If you sometimes buy CDs because of one or two good tracks, get this one to hear Come Dancing and Heart of Gold. The other tracks are pure noise, including Noise, the final track. This group is one of the many rock groups of recent years that uses volume and distortion as a substitute for quality. Please, guys, turn off the Fuzz Sound, or distortion, or whatever you call it."
4,The Kinks reinvent themselves yet again on fine album,"During the 70's the Kinks stumbled badly. With Sleepwalker and Misfits they seemed to be finding their way by reinventing themselves as an arena rock band. Ray Davies' songwriting didn't change much, just the volume and energy level.With State Of COnfusion the band catches their breath yet again and produces an album full of power and pathos. After this, with the exception of an occasional single, it was all downhill with the band producing increasingly spotty albums and dwindling sales as a result.This charm has style, charm and rocks out."
1,Faulty switch?,"Purchased one of these about 6 months ago for my legally blind, 88 year old father who lives in a retirement community. Worked like a charm for reading dinner menus, dials on the washer and dryer, etc. BUT he gave it back to me a week ago, saying the batteries needed replacement. Bought precisely the same batteries that were in it, but as soon as the battery cover is replaced, the light comes on and stays on. I cannot get the light to turn off. This leads me to believe the switch is faulty as no fiddling changes this situation. Now I'm back to Square One, looking for another portable lighted magnifying glass."
4,The Lightwedge Lighted Pocket Magnifier meets our needs.,We recommend the Magnifier. We are able to read small print and see tiny images printed in ads. The light has been used as a backup flashlight. We gave it four stars because there is no case to protect it.
2,window decal,"This product came in on timely manor, but the product is JUNK. After cleaning the window and putting it on as the directions said the heat and wind hit it, it was peeling back. Don't by this product. For the price I paid for it they should of game me a half dozen of them so it would last a yr."
3,not what I expected,"I thought this book was too basic, and didn't contain the stitch type information I was looking for. It almost seemed to pertain more to quilting stuff..."
3,"Good Watch, but Very Poor Customer Service","I've had my Invicta Lupah for 2 years, and paid for the extended 5 year warranty. It has been a good watch; nice looking and durable. In the last few months however, my screws started falling out one by one and now I only have one out of the four that I need. I tried contacting Invicta, and like others, I tried 4-5 times before getting through. They told me twice that they would ship the screws, but never did. After two months of waiting, I decided to write them a letter only to get a postcard back saying I needed to mail the watch in, at my expense, and pay $20 for them to ship it back. How frustrating??!! I don't need it serviced, I only need 3 little screws that are probably worth $.50 that never should have fallen out in the first place. If you buy an Invicta, pray that you'll never need it serviced!"
2,"Great Idea, Too Bad!","I bought this for my children for Christmas. I got it out and started playing it with them and they were all excited to play it but lost interest after they kept stepping accidentally on the ""start over"" button that is positioned right next to the number three. I covered it with my hand but they still lost their balance and hit it."
2,not updated and with a CD for win only!,"the book is useful, but it covers up to redhat 6.2. From the 7.x series many things have been changed (xinetd, kernel 2.4, iptables, directories ecc ecc). It should be necessary an update to cover the 7.1 version. What I found very disappointing is the CDROM with flash animation working ONLY in a windows environment. Don't expect to learn Linux from this book only: it's useful for the exam preparation."
2,Useless CD,"The much-vaunted CD with the electronic version of the book can be used only under Windows. The only place this is mentioned is in a README file on the CD, which can only be viewed once you have bought the book. The primary reason I got this book was for the CD and as my laptop does not run Windows, I have wasted my money. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
4,Mixed blessings but still good,"As good as most good mystery writers and better than many. By far the best female mystery writer. Women tend to write about so many things not mystery, running a bakery, selling shoes, etc. etc. V.I. is just detective. She had flaws but has a big heart that gets her in trouble. She doesn't go shopping to solve her problems, Her big problem is she is too stubborn."
3,So many mistakes,"The 3-Star rating is for the book itself, not as good as the preceding books in the series. Weak story. Weak plot. Confusing characters. However, this book wins hands down for most mistakes and typos in any document, book or otherwise, I've ever read EVER. Unacceptable. Really."
3,"OK, not great","I bought this book just for the Rome section and ripped it out to bring along. Most of the restaurants that we visited from here were just OK, not great. It still felt pretty hit or miss. Your best bet - skip books, get off the tourist track, find places that are busy with Italians eating in them and make your reservations for the next night. When we did that we were satisfied with every place we ate at."
3,Lost In The Arrangement,"Clay has such a terrific voice, I had high hopes for this CD. Clay sounds great, when you can hear him amidst one of the most disappointing and soul-deprived arrangements I've ever heard. I'm trusting his full-length CD will allow his huge talent to come through."
1,BIG TIME DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"Please save your money! Clay being compared toElvis is a big joke! The guy can sing, butit seems as if he's being made out to be morethan his is. Nice voice, but needs work. TheCD in my opinion is a waste of money."
1,Ruben Rules!,The production of the Clay singles is not up to par. Ruben's CD is MUCH better. Clay's voice is drowned out by the backup singers and music. You can barely hear him. I think they could have mixed his songs A LOT better!<P...
3,Bridge over Trouble Water pales to Simon and Garfunkles vers,"Clay is okay on Bridge, but I prefer the Simon and Garfunkle version. The harmony of the origional is so much better than Clay's.I do like this is the moment, Clay sings that much better than Bridge.Clay is improving alot since his first performance on American Idol.I know he like Ruben Studdard will just keep getting better and better.Good luck to Clay and Ruben.I recommend Clay's CD! Worth a listen! Good stuff!"
1,Chorus drowned him out,This cd was not one of Clay's best. The chorus drowned him out and in my opinion where you could hear him he oversong the songs. If you like braodway music this would be your style. Reminded me of a Disney movie.
4,"Needs more Clay, less frills","Clay Aiken emerged as a great new singer in the second season of ""American Idol."" His 2-song CD, ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""/""This Is the Night"" is ample evidence of his talent--his voice is both gentle and powerful, and he brings emotional appeal to his performances. Unfortunately, the chorus in ""Bridge"" seems to nearly drown out his beautiful voice at times, and the instrumental arrangements for that same song are too over-the-top and distracting. I would rather have heard Clay perform this classic a cappella! ""This Is the Night"" is better produced, and gives Clay a chance to shine. It's a dramatic love song that well suits him. All I can say now is bring on a full-length CD!"
5,Clay Aiken will go Farther than He Ever Imagined!,"Man...this boy can SING. I have been a fan since day 1 of AI2, when he auditioned. I was blown away immediately. This CD just confirms why his single has done so amazingly well and why his yet-to-be-named, yet-to-be-released full-length CD is #1 here. His voice is crisp, clean, and one of the best I have heard in my 32 years of life. This CD single is impressive to say the least and proves why Clay Aiken really SHOULD have won the competition."
5,This is The Night,"This is a wonderful song, sung by a most talented performer.I can't wait to buy more of Clay's CD's. He will be a huge star.He is my American Idol."
5,His voice is addictive!,"I first have to comment that as I am writing this review, I am #322...(There were only 15 reviews for Ruben's CD.)I am absolutely amazed by Clay's voice. I rarely buy singles, but as soon as I heard these songs performed on the final of American Idol, I knew that I had to have them in my collection.I'm sure that I'm not alone in hoping that Clay stays in the music business for many, MANY years...We need performers with the gift of pure talent as he clearly shows to us all!YOU'VE GOT TO BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it!"
5,America has finally spoken,"No one can play with these numbers. Congrats Clay you deserve the numger one spot. Love the songs , Love the voice, can't wait till your album comes out."
5,"Clay,Clay,Clay","I think clays single is so good this is my second review. I taped him in the finals with these two songs and played them over and over and the same with this CD. It just keeps getting better everytime I hear it. Ruben is good but his CD is good to listen to just once. Dont get me wrong, some of the songs Ruben sang that I taped I could listen to over and over but ALL the songs that Clay sings I can just keep listening to."
5,Clay Aiken's CD Single,"I thought the CD was wonderful. Clay Aiken's voice is magical and it sounds beautiful on this CD. I cannot wait for his album, because the C.D. was just a tease. I could listen to the CD all day...AND I DO!!"
5,AND THE REAL WINNER IS........,"CLAY AIKEN!!!! This record is fantastic. I love to listen to Clay's voice. I listen to this CD over and over again. The only thing I would change would be to make Bridge Over Troubled Water more like Clay's stage performance. I don't know, mabe I just love to watch Clay perform that's why I like that version better.I have already ordered 4 copies of his album when it comes out. I can hardly waite."
5,Amazing,"Without a doubt this guy is perfect. This CD just touches the surface of his talent but it is still better than what most singers put out today! His voice is a true marvel. It is so amazing that he doesn't even need music. He could sing acappella and it would blow everyone away. I would recommend this CD to anyone regardless of their musical tastes. He is that good. He was the best on AI and he should have won. Based on how good he is on this CD, he will outsell all the other AI contestants. He will prove he is the true winner."
5,Wonderful,"We will be hearing a lot of Clay Aiken in the future. A truly powerful singer with a voice that transcends anything that has been heard in many years.This is the Night is a wonderful song that showcases Clay's amazing voice. This song makes you smile, feel warm inside and makes you want to sing-along all at the same time.Everytime I hear Clay sing Bridge over Troubled Water I just melt. Yes, sometimes the choir is a little over the top, but Clay's range and voice shines through."
2,Too sappy,"Clay has a beautiful voice that truly belongs on the stage. Trying to make him into a pop star is a complete waste of time. On this CD single, he just sounds sappy and smarmy. I think he belongs in an arena where his voice is showcased, not in a recording studio. He's no Josh Groban!"
2,"A pleasant voice, I suppose.","Possibly Mr. Aiken will grow into this material and will some day and learn not to over-sing when he is dealing with a piece as beautiful and delicate as ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" however, he is not even close to being there yet. His performance is all vocal pyrotechnics with no underlying nuance. The orchestrations are so over-the-top that one suspects overcompensation on the part of the producer - as though he realized the material was beyond Mr. Aiken's talent and acted accordingly. This performance is analogous to Keanu Reeves attempting ""Hamlet"" in a filmed version. One might applaud his desire to grow as an artist while, at the same time, wish he would not have made the attempt in so public a fashion. Better, I think, that Mr. Akins should stick to the kind of bubble-gum pap he has the chops for until he is really ready to tackle something as profound as this material."
3,5 stars for Clay - 0 stars for the producers,"I loved every performance of Clay's on American Idol, but the 2 songs on this CD leave me cold. They sound as if they were rushed into production to make money as quickly as possible. On both songs the glory of Clay's voice just isn't given a chance to come across above the overdone orchestral arrangements & backup singers. Listen to Kelly Clarkson's Miss Independent, & you'll see what producers can do to showcase a fantastic voice. This CD has the sense of having been hastily cobbled into release to part Clay's rabid fans from their money. I hope the producers take more time with the album, but I have my doubts."
5,The best is yet to come!,"Clay's spirit is as strong as his voice. He seems to be someone truly dedicated to making a difference in the world. He's humble, articulate, educated and more focused on others than on himself. This is not a description of a typical 24 year old male. I know his mother is one proud lady. I feel the mix is way off on ""Bridge."" At times the music competes with Clay's voice and the voice volume varies during the song. These are technical problems and should have been corrected before the release. I feel that Clay does a great job on both songs....but I'm sure the best is yet to come. I can't wait!"
5,My American Idol,"Wow is all I can say about this CD. I agree with the others that the choir overpowered Clay on ""Bridge"" but you can still hear his wonderful voice. ""This is the night"" has to be my favorite but I can't quit playing either one of them. He truly has an amazing voice and I can't wait for his next CD to come out. I would recommend buying anything this young man sings."
5,WONDERFUL VOICE,I LOVE THE RANGE AND POWER OF HIS VOICE; IT IS SO NICE TO SEE SOMEONE LIKE CLAY DOING SO WELL. AM SO ANXIOUS FOR HIS NEW CD TO COME OUT. HE REALLY HAS CHARISMA!
5,WOW,This kid can sing. What a voice. This CD is one of the best I have heard in a long time. I can't wait to get the full Cd in August. I am glad Clay has overcome all of the talk about him not having what it takes to be an IDOL. This CD is a MUST BUY!!!
5,Clay Aiken has an absolutely beautiful voice!!,"I highly recommend this CD and am very much looking forward to the next one to be released! Clay's voice has a true and wonderful tone to it that is just beautiful ---- one of the best I've heard! He grew a lot during the American Idol II ---- achieving higher and higher goals each time he performed. These young people are very lucky to have a program like American Idol, as it would be much harder to be ""discovered"" any other way. The two songs on this CD are beautiful and showcase Clay's voice very well. He has a real talent. His pitch is perfect!!"
5,Unbelievable!!!,"We own a lot of CD's but this one absolutely has to be one of the best we have. I'm a little partial to ""This Is The Night"" but both songs on the CD are unbelievable. Words are difficult to use to describe the quality of Clay's voice. Clay can definitely sing! You owe it to yourself to get this CD.And for those who are saying get Ruben Studdard's CD INSTEAD of this one, I suggest you either listen again to the CD, or really buy the CD and listen to it rather than basing the review on something else. I would by Ruben's CD IN ADDITION to, but never instead of."
5,"It's beautiful, it's Clay, but...","Numerous folks have mentioned that the recordings on this CD sound a bit off. I think that this has more to do with the in-studio mixing than any fault of Clay's. Having heard songs from Aiken's previous CDs that he made on his own for his friends and family and which are excerpted online in many places, it's clear that Clay knows how to record properly. Like so much else with this season's American Idol, I can only think that 19 Entertainment and RCA Records must be responsible for whatever problems there are in the production quality of this CD. After all, we know very well that he has an amazing live sound which he sustained throughout the competition. Perhaps when Clay eventually has more control over his productions, we'll hear a better quality product."
5,Clay just grabs you...and doesn't let go.,"Clay is perfect as always. This guy has a voice from the heavens. He absolutely shines on this short CD, leaving you yearning for his full-length CD. Both songs are full of emotion, and Clay brings his all to both performances. When you listen to this, there is no doubt who the real ""winner"" was from American Idol, even though Clay has already grown past the confines of this title. He is a true star who will not disappoint on this CD. If you by chance have never heard him before, it will only take one listen and you will be hooked, ready to find every bit of every song you can find by Clay Aiken. Take the time to find out even more about him beyond his beautiful voice, and you will see why he is adored by fans all over the world."
1,In the words of Simon,"HORRIBLE!! I can see if you are 12 and under what the appeal might be, however this is not a CD I would recommend! It lacks orginality and Class. Mr. Aikens voice is not even powerful enough to be heard over the chior. I think America better rethink this one. (TWO THUMBS DOWN)"
1,Where's All The Power??,"I seriously cannot understand why everyone is going all gaga over him. His voice is mediocore at best and since when does shouting make your voice powerful? Whitney Houston has a powerful voice, not Clay. And no, he's not even good enough for Broadway. You need VIRBRATO for Broadway, which he has none of. Get Whitney's latest CD instead. Now that's POWER in your voice."
3,"just great""""""""""""""""""""","Love this cd,,,, can't wait for new cd to be released.. heard previews of new cd ... JUST GREAT"""""""""""""" this is the start of something wonderful... Clay Aiken's going to be really big!!!! way to go Clay!!!!!Ciao!!!!!!!"
3,Achin' for the best of Clay,"When I saw Clay during his audition, I was quite sure that he would possibly be the next winner of American Idol. I still think he should have been - his voice is legendary in a time of come-and-go idols and he stands to rise to the same place in history as Celine Dion. However, I feel the people who produced this CD were trying to replicate the same overproduced sound that Barry Manilow was known for. Like Manilow, Clay shines much brighter in his live performances. But on this CD, his voice is buried in ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" behind umpah-type orchestration and mediocre backup singers. Clay's voice shines a little brighter in ""This Is The Night,"" but again the instrumentation lacks the caliber that his voice demands in order to gain the true following he deserves. I hope his management realizes its own shallow vision before its too late. If Clay were smart, he'd ""fire"" his producers and seek out better offers..."
5,I'm just average music lover,"I'm just average music lover and I don't buy a lot music CDs. But I like Clay's voice and singing so much since he first time showed up. I'll buy whatever his music CD in the coming years. I think his magic, pure voice is a truely gift from GOD."
1,Clay needs to give it up!!,I watched American Idol 2 and have to say that the talent was much better than last seasons. That being said I think Clay Aiken should have finished 3rd in my eyes behind Kimberly Locke and Ruben. Clay has too much of a theater voice that gets really anoying after a while. I will say I was impressed at first that his voice came out of his frame but I dont think I will be buying any Clay Albums in the future. His music just doesnt appeal to me at all. I really do hope that ruben steps it up for his album and would definately love to hear a Kim Locke album as well! As for Clay.. his music just sounds [bad].
2,"Boring, average manufactured pop","Don't buy this expecting anything other than elevator music with a vocal track. It is pure manufactured bubble gum pop, and Clay's voice is on the low end of average. It gets old in a hurry. They obviously have to sculpt it extensively in the studio to attempt to pull the full dynamics from the vocals and in my opinion, they went too far. America voted, and Clay was picked second best for a reason. His voice and music just don't stand up to the test."
5,Awesome,This cd was by far one of the best I have ever heard. Clay has the most amazing voice. I would recommend this cd to everyone.
5,Talent!!!,"I really like this guy. He has a lot of talent. Clay Aiken has the voice of an angel.I'm not a fan of Simon and Garfunkel and Bridge Over Troubled Water, but Clay Aiken did them proud. Clay's voice really soars. This is the Night is so awesome and beautiful. It really showcases Clay's outstanding range. The power of his voice is right on!"
4,Idol Manipulations Continue,"I followed Clay on American Idol, and I know that he is a truly great singer. However, his producers are doing him a grave injustice. The arrangements on this first CD emphasize the music & background singers, smothering Clay's talented voice.I hope that future efforts will allow us to truly hear Clay."
2,Clay had done much better on TV!,"I love Clay's singing. His performance of Sugar Pie, Grease, Build me up buttercup, etc., on AI are so captivating, and I love to listen to those clips.Somehow, I feel the songs on the CD are rushed, and very imperfect. Clay had done better during the AI competition. I completely hate the choir in BOTW, they are so distractive and unpleasant.I have the feeling that the recording company is cheating and taking advantage of the fans.However, if you are a loyal Claymate, you should still buy it, but I am personally waiting for better songs in his CD."
4,"Great, but still can't quite do Clay justice","I'm as big a Clay fan as anyone, but I was just a tad disappointed with his first single. My complaints lie mostly with ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" The background choir really does overpower his beautiful voice, and the emotion he sang with during the live performance of this song does not carry through on the recording. However, this doesn't keep me from feeling that Clay is the best singer I've heard in a long time, and I listen to this CD every chance I get! ""This is the Night"" sounds amazing and I still get chills no matter how many times I listen to it. But I actually think his BEST song so far is ""On the Wings of Love,"" on the American Idol soundtrack. All you true Clay fans need to pick that one up too!"
4,Dodge Hitch Cover Plate,Product was shipped quickly and quite a bit less expensive than comparables.Outstanding looking face plate and very easy to install. I would have liked to have had metal attaching parts but they are plastic ;but should still last a long time; makes a great looking plate to cover ugly hole for reciever.
5,Scarily truthful,"Let me say this first... This book is brilliant. Now here's the problem...If you're not prepared for this book, you will miss the point entirely. And most people in America are not ready. Actually, they are ready, they just don't know it. Don Tjernagel covers every base as he runs around the infield of hypocrisy. Religion, sex, travel, sex, celebrities, sex, politics, and just about anything else gets covered in what is an amazingly quick read. It's scary to have an author point out flaws that you never knew you had. - and he does it without ever being judgemental. That's the most amazing thing about the book. Don attacks everyone available without ever throwing a punch. It's almost verbal aikido. No one is safe from the truth, and Don wields it like Excalibur."
1,Yuck!,"I really liked the look of this product with it's nice roomy pockets but when I removed it from the package, it reeked! A very heavy petroleum type smell. I decided to throw it in the washing machine because I could not live with that odor but it fell apart in the washer. It is now unusable and I am sorely disappointed.JCH"
4,Complete!,I always wanted this complete concert as I never got the twofer lp. Some of this is on I Sing The Body Electric and originally the twofer was released in Japan and only was available in the USA as an Import which was worth it!- kh
5,Sizzling Weather in this Report,"Recorded on January 13, 1972, at Shibuya Philharmonic Hall, an edited version of the show comprises the ""second side"" of I Sing the Body Electric. This release is the complete concert, with a clocking of 88:29.The performance is absolute dynamite, as Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Miroslav Vitous, Eric Gravatt and Dom Um Romao are delivering unbridled electricity, while hardly taking a step back for a pause. The soundscape may be amped up, but the artistry is incredible as each musician is energetically pushing himself, while demanding the same from his band mates.This is an essential recording that demonstrates what this early version of the band could deliver on stage...while paving a trail for fusion that was spectacularly unique."
3,"Soulsville, U.S.A.","I love Stax recordings and have been listening to Steve Cropper's tribute to the 5 Royales. A recall seeing a rockumentary on Stax and wanted to learn more. Soulsville, U.S.A. certainly did that. My lower rating reflects the fact that the book contains so much detail it reads like a text book (especially considering the number of footnotes). Nothwithstanding, the book is the author's labor of love, I learned a lot, and I suggest it to anyone who appreciates R&B/rock history."
1,"didn't work at all, no flies caught",We were trying to eliminate some remaining flies in our house that got in through an open fan in the window. We put these fly ribbons out for several days and no flies were caught. Seems like a complete waste of money to me.
1,Worst fly catch money can buy,"I bought close to $50 in these for my barn. Glad i bought so many because 75% of them break while you are opening them. They are so cheaply made the yellow part breaks the tape at different lengths, sometimes it left me with 2 inches of tape, sometimes 1 inch, sometimes 10 inches of tape to catch the flys. Save your money, as I thought this was a good deal but ended up being a POS."
5,Alabama's Big Velvety Teddy Bear,"From the minute I heard Ruben and from the minute he won, I knew he was going to be a big star. My friends and I did a poll at school the day of the last American Idol episode to see who they thought should win. 41 said Ruben and 5 said Clay. Way to Go Ruben! ROOOOOOOOOOBEN!"
2,Not bad but nothing specialI,"I bought this CD and Clay's. There is no comparison, in my opinion. Ruben has a good voice but his range and style is already boring to me. I hope he develops more and breaks away from the sameness of all the songs I've heard him perform. Flying Without Wings/Superstar is just so-so in my book. If I only had the money for one CD I'd definitely spend it on Bridge Over Troubled Water - Clay Aiken's"
3,Roooooben,"I have always liked Ruben's voice...his talent is incredible. However, this CD did not really appeal to me. I think he could have chosen better songs to show off his abilities. I am looking forward to his full album, but do not strongly recommend this single."
1,mediocre tracks,"Ruben Studdard has a very average, mediocre voice. Comparing the two American Idol singles, Clay's single is worth your time while Ruben's is just average. As I was listening to ""Flying WIthout Wings,"" I realized that Ruben's voice is quite raspy, hoarse, and scratchy instead of being clear and refined. I was quite disappointed overall with this purcharse and would recommend that you buy Clay's single instead of this one because at least Clay's voice is more powerful, stronger than Ruben's."
1,What's the big deal?,"I picked up a copy at the local Walgreens since it was real cheap. I wanted to see what the big deal was, and I really don't get it. Reuben Studdard does not seem to distinctive or original to me. Fly Without Wings is a strange song with annoying lyrics. It has lyrics like ""I'm flying without wings, cuz I'm your special thing"". Studdard does them no favors either. Superstar, formerly sung by Luther Vandross, is drab and boring sung by Studdard. Do yourself a favor and buy the Luther Vandross version instead."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz...........,"Frankly, this CD bored me almost to tears. He took the life and spark out of Westlife's ""Flying Without Wings""--the vocals were just, well, lazy. And ""Superstar""--a very slow tempo-ed song to begin with, then slow it down to a crawl? It was just excruciatingly painful to listen to. Not even recognizable as the old Carpenters' song. Maybe I can use it when I can't sleep!"
5,RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUBEN,Big Rub is amazing. He rocks on the cd and his album is going to unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and pick up this cd to hear the next big music superstar. 205 fo sho!
2,Slowwwwwwwwww,"Love Ruben, but VERY disappointed in his single. Superstar was so slow, I found it difficult to get through the entire song. Whoever ""helped"" him with the rendition did him a terrible disservice.Wings was so-so good.I hope the album picks up the pace (and his talent). I could never listen to 12-15 songs on one cd if they are anything like this single.The single gets two stars just for Ruben being Ruben.....it would have gotten zero stars had it been anyone else singing."
3,Good Start,"Superstar is really good. I've read the other reviews and don't understand the bashing.Flying Without Wings is pretty good.The recording quality on FWW is terrible. Sounded OK in my car but very thin on my home setup. Sounds like they put a sock over the microphone.To the people at RCA, do you listen to the final cut on normal stereos? Please mix the vocal more out front with the high end normalized without the massive comressors."
2,A little bland,"Ruben Studdard certainly has a very pleasant voice, but both of these songs are a little bland for me. Flying just doesn't move me at all. As far as Superstar goes, having owned the Carpenter's haunting rendition this sounded more like a lullaby. Just no excitment here, which is too bad for a first effort."
1,Really not worth it,"It's just my opinion but, I bought the package containing Clay and Ruben's CD and I listened to Clay's two songs first and both his performances really tugged at my heart, way too good for words. Then I listened to Ruben's two singles, and I was really dissapointed. They were two good, safe songs for him however they were so boring. On ""Superstar"" the intro with the vio;lins will leave you asleep before he even begins to sing. Like other reviewers have said there is much misplaced sincerity in his voice. ""Flying Without Wings"" really isn't much better, because Ruben's voice is weak, and tired sounding. However I believe that his live peformance which are great will leave him in the spotlight for a while."
2,So So--Clay Was Robbed,"Ruben seems to be a nice enough young man but I thought American Idol was looking for the best voice and that was definitely Clay--there is no comparison between the two as far as singing talent and presentation--I could never understand what all the fuss was about--I'm sorry, I just never saw it--he is a so, so singer and I wouldn't waste my money on his CD"
1,Embarassing,"This whole pop/american idol malarky is a joke. Entertaining to watch but then afterwards your left with the BLANDNESS of the winners releasing BLAND songs and BLAND albums with BLAND music videos. A quick cash in carbon copy of every other pop singer in the world today. It doesnt matter how good his voice is (and really I prefer Lemar by about a million x) , this is a cover of a Westlife song, that says it all....'Music' career down the pan I feel!"
2,Same ole Ruben,"Ruben has a great voice but my 2 problems are 1, he only sings slow songs. One sounds just like the next. 2, his voice lacks that special sound that makes him stand out from all of the other sultry singers you hear today. But hey, if that is the sound your looking for, then this is the cd for you!"
3,Not Bad,"It was...pretty good. A nice listen, but after a while, the songs get tiring, and I felt it lacked some of the soul felt on American Idol."
4,The Velvet Teddy Bear's debut single!,"I first want to let you all know, I am a Clay Aiken fan. Clay is my favorite, HOWEVER I also love Ruben. He is VERY talented.Ruben was one of my favorites from the begining. He has a smooth voice that just made America fall in love. Flying Without Wings is one of my favorite performances by him. He sings so beautifully on it. Superstar, however, is what dropped the score to 4 stars. I find his voice great on it, however the song is TOO slow. I always wonder when it ends.I know this doesn't explain too much, however spend the few dollars to listen to the American Idol winner. That way you can decide whether you are a Ruuuuben fan or not before spending [$$$] or more for his Debut CD. He has talent in the R & B genre, so if you are into that kind of music, give Ruben a try."
5,Flying without Wings the best!,"Ruben's voice is wonderful on both songs of Flying without wings Cd.Ruben is classically trained and his voice showed just how great it is week after week on American Idol.I know other people on Idol were sometimes flat, off key in places and even forgot words sometimes. Not Ruben, he was dead bang on each performance.I am happy to give five stars to this CD. Go Ruben,And Good luck too all the American Idol finalists."
1,No Why Ruben,Ruben Did Not Do This Song Justice. If You Are Going To Cover A Song You Better Do A Better Job Then The Origal. If You What To Hear Flying Without Wings Song Like It Should Be Check Out Westlife.
1,Ruben always sounds the same,"No matter what he sings, Ruben sounds the same whether it was on the show or off. Clay is superior to Ruben in every way, and this is proven by the following facts: Clay is beating ruben in CD sales 4 to 1. After 31 days on the billboard, Clay's CD went platinum! Ruben never made it that far.When Ruben sings it makes you feel like hes going to have a stroke right then and there. I purchased Rubens CD just to take a look at the so called winner of american idol. He may be the winner of the TV show, but in REAL life Clay is the champion."
1,Slow!!! ZZZZ!!!!,"I thought both the songs were really really dreadful!! Superstar was so slow and boring! You should really listen to it if you are an insomniac!! Ruben's version of Flying Wihthout Wings was really horrible, and I suggest listening to the Westlife version...it is much much better!"
1,totally boring,"sorry, ruben, you just can't cut it. your voice is totally boring and you have no range. try something else because you just can't sing"
2,Not Up To An American Idol Standard,"I was highly disappointed in this cd. Maybe it was just poor mixing/recording but it is boring with a capital ""B"". I like Ruben and Flying Without Wings is ""OK"" but Superstar - NOT! I was all excited about the album but now, think I will pass."
2,Flying Without Wings,"I do enjoy his voice, but comparing it to the version sung by Westlife, years ago, his is definitly subpar. Though Ruben does have an excellent voice."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought both Clay and Ruben's CDs to give them both a chance. Ruben's ""Flying Without Wings"" is a good song, but he sounds like he's exhausted and about to fall asleep while singing it. Not the emotion that he had live. I don't even know what to say about ""Superstar"". Why it is so slow and drawn out I'll never know. I can't listen to that anymore. I hate to say this, but Clay's CD is so much better. I've listened to it over and over and I'm from 205!! I feel like a traitor, but there's just such a big difference!"
3,Disappointed,I was hoping Rubens CD would be great and it wasn't. Some of the songs he sang on AI were good and many were mediocre. Unfortunately this single is not his best.
2,Not good enough for Ruuuuuuben!,Ruben has a great voice and can do great things. So then why was he given two songs that don't showcase this talent to it's full capacity? Ruben is just too good for these songs!Superstar is so slow it makes me crazy. I've never really liked any versions of this song though.Flying Without Wings isn't horrible but it's still not the kind of song that Ruben could really work with and make him own. I'm really disappointed in J Records and their handling of Ruben. Ruben can be a big star if he's given the right material and some artistic license.
2,Boring,"As a HUGE Clay Aiken fan (who IS the American Idol), I thought I'd give this a listen (didn't buy it - only listened to it!). I was very disappointed. He has a great voice, although nowhere near Clay's, but this was boring and almost put me to sleep. I only hope on his full length CD they try something new with Ruben to show off his voice. Can't recommend."
2,Better then on A.I ... but that doesnt say much.,"I listened to both Clays and Rubens singles. Rubens felt like it lasted forever! my god i prayed it would end! Flying Without wings is better on here then on American Idol...but that doesnt say much no does it? Ruben lost it. Plain and simple he lost the spark that made ruben so great. Maybe its because he forgot 205. How knows. If i were you i would get clays single. THAT it great! Much love to Both Ruben And Clay, i just wish ruben and clay fans didnt hate eachother so much! Its a shame!"
1,America's GOLDEN IDOL has feet of clay,"Extremely disappointing!!! The trouble with releasing covers is that they have to be at least as good as, if not better than the originals. This is not the case with either of these songs. Superstar is painfully slow and over embroidered (a la Mariah Carey). I liked Westlife's Wings, but this is a bloated version with no sense of direction or climax.I don't dislike Ruben's voice, but I think it is a shame that they have released two of his weakest performances as his first single rather than two of his strongest - A Whole New World & How Do You Mend A Broken Heart?It is fascinating to follow the aftermath of the TV show. Clay and Ruben both have potential, and the world is watching, but if the recent media appetite and their respective singles are a true indication of what is to follow, I predict that Clay will be a SUPERSTAR and Ruben will be a shooting star."
4,mellow fellow,Ruben's mellow soulful voice is suited for R&B songs and transcends the 2 songs on his single. I can not wait for him to release a full album of music. I think that Ruben is among many new artists who are finally bringing the music industry back from the brink of mediocrity. I highly recommend this CD.
3,Meh...,"Don't get me wrong, I think Ruben is a good singer but he vocal range is not as good as I would like it. I think that he was better then Kelly who won last year on American Idol thought."
2,"Just ""okay.""","I bought this Cd because I like to support new talent, but Studdard's voice is fairly mediocre. Instead, I'd recommend either Clay Aiken, who seems to handle a much larger range, or, for a current album, Josh Groban."
1,Whaaaaaaaaaat?,"This CD is OK. That's all. I don't see what the big deal with Ruben is. I mean He's good and he has a nice voice but I honestly don't see why he was so above all of the other contestants especially after listening to this CD. I mean I think personally that Trenyce would have been better or even either of the Kimberlys for the title of American idol after listening to this CD. First Superstar: How many times can the word Baby be in one song? Next Flying without wings: I personally don't think this is bad but it sound somewhat forced and not so smooth. all in all I think Clay's CD is 1,000,000x better."
5,A Great Great Great Voice,"Never have I heard such a powerful voice. This man has star written all over him. The way he sang Superstar brought tears to my eyes. I remember that song being sung by Karen Carpenter, and I know she is smiling in heaven right now. Flying without wings should be nominated for a grammy. It is simply beautiful. If you buy only one cd this year, this is the one to get. Can't wait to hear more from this wonderful,talented young man. God Bless You Ruben."
2,In the cabinet,I waited a week to post a review because I always love a CD when I first get it. So I bought both Ruben's and Clay's singles. Clay's is still in player. Ruben's is already in the cabinet. Guess that says it all.
3,you are the new american idol,I would'nt buy this ruben's okay but comparing him to the late barry white is nonsense now if ruben gets an orchestra like barry did then we'll talk. anyway not a bad song nothing groundbreaking he's a follower not a trendsetter.
2,I still think Clay should have won but...,"Being born in the north and raised in the south I have grown to love all kinds of music. I admittedly did not watch the first season of American Idol (with no regrets)but tuned into the second season because my friend informed me that it had much more talent then the first season. I quickly grew to love two singers (who both got in the top 12), Clay and Carmen. I was so pleased to see Clay continue to move on and disappointed when Carmen was kicked off. I never really liked Ruben as he seemed like a very fake person who won because Simon hinted that he thought Clay was gay (which I don't believe). Anyway, having listened to both of the single CD's I believe that there is only one good song on both of the CD's...that is This is the Night by Clay Aiken. Save your money...they both aren't worth it..."
2,I know it just isn't me...,"Ruben's voice does nothing for me personally. I know a lot of people are a big fan of his voice, but it really is hit or miss with him. I find his voice dull & boring, and this ""Flying without Wings"" song is very difficult to listen to without drifting off and either putting in a new CD, or changing the radio dial.I'm not going to get into the whole ""Clay should have won"" thing, because he didn't. Ruben is the American Idol, and the Idol should have put out a better first single than this. It's very poorly done."
1,Can't believe this is THE American Idol,"This single is all it takes to know that winner or not...Ruben is not an American Idol.Not only does he lack charisma, personality, and any energy at all...but his singing voice is so limited. He has a range of about 7 notes, sings off key 50% of the time, and is so monotone and boring it is painful to listen to this CD.The American people have done this young man an injustice to make him have any hope of becoming a success as a singer. Flying Without Wings is too long as it is and when you have to endure the way Ruben drags it out, it can be torture. Please don't waste your money on this CD. Buy the American Idol Season 2 Love Songs CD and hear the voices of those who should have stayed longer than Ruben."
2,"Great voice, great singing, great melody...DUMB SONG!","Ruben Studdard sound promising as a young R&B singer and the music for this song sounds good. The problem is, the song is dumb sounding. It sounds as it's trying to be poetic ""I'm Flying Without Wings"" as to say flying off of a high or imspiration but it just does not work. When you are flying without wings you are either floating for hurtling in the air.Again Studdard sounds great and hopelully will bring better stuff in the future. After all look at Kelly Clarkson with Miss Independent. Both ""In A Moment Like This"" and ""Before Your Love"" stunk.Now as for Clay Aiken....never heard anything by him. I still hear to many ""oldies but goodies"" on the radio and on everyones music systems."
1,LA music fan,"Ruben has a beautifully mellow voice; however, I was very disappointed in this single. It sorely lacks originality and lacks the punch I was expecting from a cd for the winner of an American Idol. Very disappointing."
2,The Westlife Version Is Far Better,"All of those people who said that Clay is better than Ruben is wrong. On the charts and even on amazon.com, clay's albums have been selling a lot better than rubens. I have both albums and I think that Clay's is better. Flying Without Wings was done a lot better by Westlife. Check their version out instead."
2,The wrong one won.,"After listening to Flying Without Wings, it is very obvious that the wrong one won! Ruben certainly does have talent - but does not have the kind of voice that will hold up over time. He sounds more like a Vegas lounge act in this rendition."
4,simple love for Moorcock and his worlds. This one too.,"Allot of well written and intellectual reviews here. I am a very simple man. However I have been reading Moorcock for over 25yrs. I can say some of the books many times. I avoided this series due to how off the beaten path it seemed and I am glad I did. Not because it is bad, but because its so different. It takes a while for you to get into the story but the story is at times so all over the place. This is why I do not recomend it for some one whoe is not a seasoned Moorcock reader.But that is only one perspective of course. This is such a wonderfully moorcock book and I appreciate his ability to be diverse yet stay within the multiverse theory.I was yet again sad to see the end of the book and wanted there to be another to read just as big."
5,"If you only read Elric, then read this...","The ""Eternal Champion"" series has proven to be a valuable addition to the Moorcock collection. If you never rummaged through used book stores, then you would have never read all Moorcock has to offer. In 'Dancers' you get a comedy that reads like a sit-com on LSD. As previously stated, the prose flows with wit and adds entertaining jabs at English arrogance and religious fanatics. The colorful cast of characters are kept very true thoughout the three stories. I found it immensely entertaining to try to anticipate how the cast of characters would reunite (as they always do.) I had a hard time getting started, but could not stop reading after the first story."
2,It Broke,"I ordered this for my son who is in college (storage space is an issue). It might be that he just did not take proper care of it, but it broke after a week. It may be fine for someone who is careful with their things but I would not buy it again."
1,"Poor quality, unreliable","The quality is terrible. The button only worked 10% of the time, and when the light would actually stay on, the light would flicker so much as to make it unusable.I replaced this with a Belkin Kindle Light (which I just use for standard book reading, and the build quality on the Belkin is much better, it's reliability and the brightness of the lamp is excellent."
2,worked well at first for several months..,"..but when it came time to replace the batteries, I found the screws that held the battery compartment down were too tight and had to destroy them to remove the cover. Otherwise, it worked ok."
4,The LightWedge is Pretty Good,"Overall, the LightWedge Flex Neck Reading Light is a good product.Pros:* It's built tough (doesn't seem like the neck or clip would wear out anytime soon).* It has pretty good quality components considering the price.* The light is very bright and reduces eye strain.* It's lightweight and compact.* Comes with extra batteries.Cons:* The neck is kind of short so when I use it with my textbook, I have to re-clip it to different parts of the book to get the most light. It's kind of annoying.* The on/off button, located on the opposite side of where the bulbs are, is ""buggy."" Sometimes I have to press three times in order for the light to turn on.* Not sure how long the batteries will last but I can see replacing the batteries getting to be annoying."
2,So So,"I would've given it 5 stars because the lighting was great and it clipped well, or so I thought. The clip broke the 1st 2 weeks I had it. I guess you get what you pay for. I just ended up going to the dollar store and getting one that works amazing!!!!"
4,cool light,"Perfect lightweight light to clamp on my books, I take it on the train to read by,am glad I decided to get this one.I print off puzzels and clamp the light on my clip board that I do my puzzels on. I set it near my keyboard at night when am on the computer, as I don't like alot of light and it's just enough. I clip it on my ball cap at night when am outside."
1,Piece of garbage-arrived broken,"Arrived broken, only 1 of the 2 LED lights lit up, made very little to no difference. Do not buy. Would have given 0 stars."
3,semi fair purchase,"This revier will be short. if you're like me and want to be a doctor, you spend half your life in books (not by choice) and the other half catching up on research projects and require a small portable light like this one. the light is not very bright but it gets the job done. i dropped it once and it wouldnt come on anymore. i dropped it again and now it works fine??!! well overall its acceptable, if you want a really good light pay a little more money."
2,Not great,"I just got this in the mail. It comes with batteries, which is nice, and I think it would be great if it had more than two puny lightbulbs. It doesn't give much light at all. Certainly does not ""cover the page with light."""
5,Book Reading Light,"I've bought many book reading lights, but this is absolutely the best. The flex-neck allows the light to be evenly distributed over any book size, whether its paperback or hard cover.The Lithium button cell batteries do seem to last a long time. If you buy them in bulk, it's not too expensive to replace, a much better option than the heavy rechargeable units.It's now 2010, and have not found any reason to look for anything better from a weight, battery life, and function standpoint. I now have 3 for use in multiple locations."
2,Disapointed,"I just got this today. You turn this off and on at the very top of this light, but the button doesn't always function properly. Sometimes the button will stay down (keeping the light on) but often it just pops right back up again. The item's package (not the box it was shipped in) was also open at the top, and I wonder if it had been returned by someone else as a defective item. Perhaps it just took a beating during shipment. I'm debating on whether it is worth returning or not."
2,Not as described,The light is supposed to give quality light but does not. I use this for singing to Hospice patients because their rooms are always so dark even during the day. Others in our group have reading lights and they are very bright. This one is not. Would not buy again or recommend.
3,Light not so bright,"It's a nifty idea that doesn't quite shine bright enough. I got it to use with my kennel. However, the speed at which I received it is unbelievable! Of all the lights I have tried and bought, this is the best one--just not the one!"
4,Great for camping,"Used these on a scout campout. The noise from the crickets/etc was a near 'roar' at night, put these in and you can't hear them hardly at all. I was very impressed. They are a little big for my ears, but you get used to them fast."
2,"good idea, don't like the making","bought this for my 3,5yr old daughter. she loves to dance, bounce, run and I thought she would love it. yes she would.but: the toy moves when she is playing with it. meaning it slides away under her. there is no grip on the bottom of the mat.also, the game where you have to follow the instructions is way too fast and the audio signal - when wrong - is VERY annoying.no good."
1,Not for young children,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter who loves to dance, but this mat is way too fast for a 3 year old, even the 5 and 7 year olds were struggling with it. It also does not work properly when you step on some of the pictures and within 5-10 seconds, the game is over. I would not reccommend this at all."
2,Terrible.,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not once was because there were a few moments that genuinely intrigued me scared me, but other than that, these stories are utter drivel. They are nothing but re-tellings or ""remakes"" of other classic Lovecraft stories. They also are drawn-out and boring, with ridiculous character narrative used in EVERY SINGLE STORY. I guess this book is o.k. if you've read everything else and you're still hungry for more Lovecraft, but to put it very informally and blunt- it sucks."
3,"Ersatz Lovecraft, but not without appeal","One should be warned that these stories are mostly not written by Lovecraft, but by his self-proclaimed inheritor, August Derleth. And the discerning reader will notice a difference in the depth and texture of these stories as compared to the real deal. There also is considerable repetition in the themes of these stories. However, one of the odd things about Lovecraft fans (myself included) is that imitation is not necessarily considered a bad thing--the obsessive repetition of Lovecraft's themes seems somehow a fitting homage to his helpless mortals drawn to their doom by forbidden knowledge. My recommendation is to read the real Lovecraft first. If you like it, you'll probably think this is OK too."
4,Enjoyable and convenient!,"I must disagree with the more vitriolic reviews of this edition. For one thing, it's great to have all of these stories in one place. I don't have the time or the money to hunt down all of the Arkham House pressings of these stories. Secondly, though these are clearly not quite up to the caliber of ""real"" Lovecraft stories, they are very enjoyable-certainly for someone who has all of the Lovecraft stuff. And last but not least, though his name is not printed as largely as Lovecraft's, it very clearly says, ""and August Derleth"" on the cover of the book. I'd say if you're a Lovecraft fan who has everything, this book is a fine addition to your collection. Sure, it would have been nice to have had S.T. Joshi do the annotating on this, but truthfully that's about my only complaint. As I said, very enjoyable."
4,Play Supermarket Set,The reason I purchased this item was for a play set for a primary school classroom. The children all loved playing the items and pretending to be the cashier and the customer. Each piece was very effective in the objective of the toy. I would reccomend this as a good play center.
3,Fun,Fun but was really for a younger child than stated . It was not as quality as other pieces from this collection
3,Fine album from The Kinks but....well a little weak in spots,"They had a new audience. They were selling records again. Finally, after a second long dry period The Kinks seemed to have it made. Never as popular as The Stones or The Beatles (much less The Who), they were, arguably, one of the best British Invasion bands.GTPWTW is a bit of a back step. After two three terrific albums, Ray returned with a handful of strong songs. There's nothing wrong with the record..just the feeling of been there, done that. The follow up would reestablish the band again critically and commerically."
1,Doesn't play well with mice,"I tried this mouse pad with 3 different mice; 2 optical and one laser. Sticky, jumpy, non-responsive. It looks to me like this pad was designed to be used with an old fashioned mouse with a ball. If your mouse has a ball, it should work fine, if it's optical, don't buy it. I will say however, that I returned the pad to the manufacturer and received an immediate refund with no problems, so the customer service is very good."
2,movie disaster,"The 2 stars were given for the 2 percent of the movie that isworth watching.So, this movie smells but is not a stinker...close."
3,Its okay,the book and its content is a litlle bit outdated. however it has good basics steps for stroke rehabilitation. Good resourse for the money>
4,Help with a song!,"Hello all, I'm looking for a song in the Herbie Fully Loaded movie that I can't find in the soundtrack.. it's played when Trip convinces Maggie to take a ride on his ""super"" car.. it's an electroclash/rock song with lyrics by a girl, it reminds me of Peaches..anyone could help?"
3,Checked out this and the voyager,"Its not bad but its heavy. lots of words and phrases. IT DOESNT TRANSLATE ANYTHING YOU TYPE IN. JUST INDIVIDUAL WORDS and you may have trouble with conjugated verbs. I found its competitor a bit clearer in sound prounounciation. The franklin is also a bit clumsy. The slide in and out keyboard is a bit off balance to use when its out.Its permanent rechargable battery (i couldnt find how to remove it) may be good, but if it loses charge (they should last a very long time), you cant replace it with regular AAA bateries and you may not be in a country that has 120V current. And if you have to carry a converter, whats the point. I liked the voyager better. Its lighter, at least as easy to use, a bit quicker and speaks more clearly. Of course, all I did was check out the italian."
1,no.,"This thing is over price and for the average user, useless. It is VERY cheaply made, and feels like it'll break at any moment.The buttons and functions arent intuitive and all the buttons are laid out in a confusing way. You cant input more then one word at a time. and many times it has no idea what you are looking for.The only really great thing about this translator is that it has many languages in it's database. Not just asian languages. A big plus for european countries. But because of it's lack of functionality. It's pretty useless where ever you are on this planet.another cool thing is that it talks. But the speaker sounds like crap, so you'll have to use earphones or put it up to your ear to hear it properly.save your money with this one and bring your laptop with you...(yeah, that's a dumb suggestion, but seriously, you're better off doing that then buying this thing)"
5,Easy to install and works great!,"I was able to mount my 20"" LCD in about 15 minutes using this product. It feels very secure on the wall and is easy to remove the LCD from the unit in case you need to make some adjustments. It can be tightened into place or left slightly loose so you can reposition with ease."
1,A work of pure garbage!,This must be one of the worst CLEP subject review books I have read. The course material covered is completely out-of-date and the emphasis also seems to be on mountains of this same outdated material! This book provides tons of test material that is almost completely useless! No-one will benefit by relying on this useless book for their CLEP exam!
4,Great game,"I have to say that fur fighters is one of the best games I have seen for dreamcast. It will certainly keep you going for a long time. The only reason that hinders me from giving five stars is that of the games' difficulty. It is fun, but the puzzles can be mildly frusterating at times. I highly recomend buying it however."
3,Couldn't get pass the controls,"I thought the graphics of the characters were kind of weird at first. But I ignored it and tried to get into the game.I didn't get very far before feeling like the controls were impossible to get down. For instance, there is this stage where you hit these bags of flour. Some are raised above the floor, while other sit on the floor. Trying to jump and hit the bags was difficult. There didn't seem to be a rhythm with which to jump and punch. running, jumping and punching was even more difficult. Sometimes I got it, most times I didn't. I put the game down after an hour of that (c'mon, how hard should it really be just to jump and punch a bag?).Seeing the high ratings of others puts the idea of playing back in my head. Perhaps, I'll get back to it.I gave it three stars because of the aforementioned reasons but the game did show some promise. Maybe I just stink at video games in my old age. =)"
4,Handy iPAQ accessory,This foldable keyboard is great for allowing the use of your PDA as a mini notebook. It is compact and light. I use it when I am flying. It is also great at home when I have large entries to make because it has a jack that allows for the iPAQ to run on AC instead of the battery.
5,My favorite!,I loved this book! ive read the whole series but this is my favorite. it was kinda funny how when Amy first changes no one knows whats going on. It was sad though how they did all those test and she ran away. I don't think id like it if i became 20 all in one night. but its just a storie
4,A good book,I think this was a good book. Amy can't wait for her 13th b-day but when she wakes up that day something happens to the way she looks and she misses her big b-day party because of it...
4,Brooks are all ways good..,I have put 200 miles on these all ready. I usually buy 'Beasts' even though I don't over-pronate because I really pound the pavement. These seem to be holding-out well...
3,Not for the Novice,I purchased these plans based on a rating that it was for the novice but I feel it is more for the intermediate to expert. I expected it to have a list of material that I would need but I could not find any for what kind of wood and how much. You have to read the plans and figure out what you need and how much you need. It would have been much easier if it had a schedule of materials. I am some what disappointed with this.
2,below average,"Your typical stat book written by a typical stat professor: dull, dry, and boring and geared towards other professors instead of people who might actually want to *learn* something.There are a lot of good stat books out there, but you will never find them in class. Tolerate this book if it is assigned for the class, but buy something a lot better if you really want to learn about regression."
2,Headset OK,"I bought this as a cheap replacement for the one I lost. It works well about 70% of the time. Many times it becomes difficult to hear the person on the other end. I use it with a Blackberry 8330. That could be the problem. I only use it when driving so it works almost enough for my needs. If you are a constant headset user, this is not the product for you."
1,This is just a made for TV VH1 documentary,There are no songs on this DVD. No Videos. You've already seen it 6 times on VH1. Don't assume Dolby Digital means 5.1. It's in stereo only.
1,Sony fails the test,"I have bought Sony products over the years for their high quality. This item is a very big disapointment from the start. I bought it mainly for the DVD operation which never worked. The door would not open. Took to Sony repair shop who replaced laser. Still did not work, returned to repair shop. They replaced laser again. Did not work. Now Sony is going to do something, not sure what. But after paying a high price I have no unit."
1,I won't buy Sony again.,"From the product description, this DVD/VCR combo from Sony sounded terrific. However, the DVD player did not work. The unit played VCR tapes well, but would not play DVDs. I sent the unit back for a refund. This is the second dud DVD player I purchased from Sony. I won't buy Sony products again."
4,Good DVD/VCR player.,"It's definitely better than my Onkyo dvd player. But one problem, can't seem to program my Sony Wega remote to control it."
5,It works great!,"Do not listen to the other reviewers saying it don't work well, it works great! I had no problems with it what so ever. You people are probably just bored writing down comments about it saying it don't work well. I kept my other VCR so that way I can hook it up to the new VCR I bought and make copy of videos. I was scared to buy it for a minute because I heard some bad things about it. Well, it is true that there is a small chord that won't even fit too but I have my TV close to the VCR like 1-inch to it and it works fine. The picture is great, the sound is good, and the tracking will adjust the quality for you. While I was watching my DVD's it didn't seem to skip at all. It works great as long as you take very good care of it and everything."
1,worse customer service on earth,after a series of problems with the potentiometers i finally was able to actually talk to a live person in tech support.i was told parts will be shipped under warranty to me.after 4 months of waiting and calling i finally talked to a live person again and was told im sorry sir but your hotas system is now out of warranty.they did this very same thing to a friend of mine.i sent them the money for parts and still havent received anything.its a great system when it works but it wears out too fast and its not worth the money or agrivation involved.out of 15 friends who have this system12 are broken.we are now cannablizing each others systems for parts.
5,The only HOTAS for serious Flight Simmers,"I've had my Cougar for just over a month, and it is quite a departure from the Saitek controllers I've used for the past 7 years. I've worn out 2 X-36s and an X-45 over that time. Several folks in my virtual wing have used their same Cougar for that same amount of time, so the extra expense of a Cougar over multiple disposable Saiteks is a great bargain.This HOTAS works flawlessly as long as you install/setup correctly. I suggest you visit http://cougar.frugalsworld.com/ for the updated software and proper installation and setup instructions.If you are a serious fighter sim enthusiast, click ""buy now""!PSI also bought CH Pro Pedals along with the Cougar, and they work together with no problems."
1,No good,I started having problems with this clock about six months after I bought it. The buttons stick and you have to keep pressing them to unstick them. I will be listening to the radio on it and it will just shut off. The volume dial is very touchy..You have to turn it just right or it will start blaring. I am very disappointed with this alarm clock. I have a different alarm that is almost ten years old and have never had one problem with it. I do NOT recommend this item to anyone!
5,most beautiful music,"for me, it is the most beautiful music I have ever heard! Like a meditation or prayer floating on a cloud."
5,One of the best holiday movies ever,"If you have a real dark sense of humor and love the anti-holiday movies, this movie is up your alley.There isn't anything really special about the Blu-Ray version (for those who already own Badder) but it was nice to have in a true high def sense."
4,christmassy brilliance,I enjoyed Bad santa and thought it was funny. I am really 14 but i havnt got an account so i am meant to be under 13! The skateboard bully is really nasty to the fat kid but the skateboard bully is so fit and gorgeus i focus my attention just on him really! his real name is Max Van Ville and he is a bit of a hunk.The film is good and im glad i have the dvd for obvious reasons but the film is worth watching if like me teenage girls want a bit of eye candy to admire then watch Bad santa! thats all im sayin.
2,Bad Ticket Buyer,"I was not offended at all by this movie, I do not relate Santa to religion anyway. What I was offended by, is Billy Thornton's terrible acting job. Yes, he makes a believable drunk, yet he still gives a dry performance. I still admire the man, even if he, for whatever reason, decided to star in this stinker.There are several laughs here though, mostly at the expense of a short person (I don't think saying midget is politically correct)..Good for brain numbing, mindless entertainment..and nice to see the dedication at the end of the film to the late John Ritter, who plays a role in the film. He plays it rather well I might add...."
3,bad cut,"The director 's cut contains a lot more profanity, but cuts out some of my favorite scenes. Disappointed with this selection. Should have rented Badder Santa instead or at least the original cut."
2,Not that great,Pretty crass and for no really good reason. Plus the story line drags - what's the point? Don't rent or buy this one.
1,Horrific Language.,"I know that this was very dark humor, which I could live with. However, the word F- - - ! used in all of its tenses was disgusting and I'm not a prude!"
1,Need region code next to DVD.,"Can't play DVD in Austrlia. I bought it when I was new to Amazon and I would loose money sending it back for a refund. As the page was emailed to a Australian address, I thought I would be able to play it. I have learnd the hard way. It would be good if only 'any region' Blu Ray titles could be emailed out to those in region 2."
1,"Like good, vulgar comedy? STAY AWAY from this movie....","Some people are offended by nudity, needless sexual scenes, violence, and profanity in movies. i am NOT one of those people. i do feel that needless sexual scenes are stupid and pointless, but i'm not offended by it. Bad Santa is not a good comedy. It is not a good drama. It is not a good romance. It's pretty much not a good anything. The commercials for this movie were quite funny. The movie, however, isn't. You'd think the idea of a santa gone bad would be hilarious, but all this movie does it take Thornton's character, and have him constantly, drink, wet his pants, get laid, act mean to kids, etc. Parts of it are mildy humorous, but overall, it's just dumb. Maybe you shouldn't consider my review, because i was so unimpressed by the movie that i turned it off around 3/4 of the way through. If you don't believe my, try it out. Maybe you'll like it more than i did."
1,Bad Santa,Worst movie ever. Very disappointing. Vulgar. So sorry I bought it. And so bad I don't want to resell or donate. Throwing it in the trash!
4,I laughed my ass of!!!!,"The movie is extremely funny, best christmas movie i'v ever seen, Billy Bob thornton plays a drunk, extremely lazy santa with a black midget as a sidekick, he does all the things you would never picture santa doing from beating up kids and robbing shopping malls, although he starts to get a feal for christmas when a small fat kid takes a liking to him, santa uses him by taking advantage of the kids stupidity and moves in with him and his grandmaa, in the end starts taking a liking to him and things only get funnier. This movie deliveres the whole christmas feal in the best possible way and is really quite original it gets my deffinant thumbs up, you must watch it!!!!"
5,You Ain't Gonna Sh*t Right For A Week!,"And that line right there is reason enough to see this movie. I remember when this movie came out, I wanted to see it but never got around to it. I finally saw it this past Xmas and all I can say is non-stop laughs. The unrated version only has about 10 minutes or so of extra footage, but the scene where he breaks into the rich man's house is hilarious! This movie is sooooooo wrong on so many levels! It is the perfect anti-Christmas movie. Totally un-PC. I couldn't believe some of the things in this movie. It's one of those movies one must see. It is definitely not for everyone, trust me, some people will find this movie offensive. But if you're not one of those people, see this flick. You won't be disappointed."
4,A wonderfully vile movie,"First off this is NOT in any way appropriate for kids!this ain't no feel-good Holiday Film, hoo boy! No Way!I liked this movie, but then again i have a bit of a perverse sense of humour.This flick's vile, crude, vulgar & disgusting. And it's funny. If you like seeing all of your sacred cows turn into hamburgers on the grill, this film's for you.Well I take back a small part of the feel-good Holiday Film, it *does* have a good ending.....in a way.....watch it to see."
4,awsomely funny must see!!!,this movie is gold. awsomely funny it will have u cracking up at the egde of your set. u can't get much better then this movie. it is the perfect x-mas movie. one of the funnyest movies that year. a must see for all
5,I think I sharted in my pants,"Dark, sick, Vulger, Twisted! but in a strange way it touched my heart... billy bob could only play this part this good.a Xmas must."
2,very disappointed,"I was not really that satisfied with this movie. I expected better because Bernie Mac and Billy Thornton played in this together. This has to be one,of their worst movies"
5,i loved it,this is a dark comedy but the humor is so funny you won;t even notice and you do feel sorry for willie in the end.
5,Great,"It was new as advertised, I haven't watched it yet as I am going to wait for December to watch it."
4,Holiday guilty pleasure,"Every laugh brings on the guilt, but can't help watching every year. Not for children. Wonder what happened to Herman."
1,Not happy,It had no instruct book. would not play me CD's. The radio was nothing by static. Very unhappy with the none player
3,More Jets Crap,"It's like any other sports team magnet I've ever purchased except it's a Jets magnet, thus the 3 stars. My Redskins magnets are only on the car on gamedays, had them for 2 years, and they are still great shape and I've never had one fly off the car and I live over an hour from the stadium."
3,"Great images, poorly reproduced.","Darius Kinsey's photographs are great, and this book reproduces many fascinating views of logging life, but unfortunately quality of the reproductions are disappointing."
5,video buff,great tv show have all the seasons anyone will like this show good clean entertainment recommend it for everyone in the family
1,Got a Lemon?,It started out good but after a week the rudder twist control went bonkers. Perhaps I got a lemon. I think this controller is a piece of junk look for something else.
5,outstanding joystick - best I ever used,"cons: The stick is right-handed ONLY.pros: Everything works well, even the 3d & throttleA big improvement over my old sidewinder 3d.I beat my old high scores the first day on several games."
5,top gun joystick,"i bought this way back in the day when mechwarrior 3 was released and i still use it now , incredible durrable broke ounce but it was a simple matter of sadering a wire back on .what make this joy stick diffrent and better is the fact unlike its overpriced satiek cousin that uses a spring in the joystick ( wich can make for unsmooth movment) the top gun doesnt and the adjustable resistance knob on the buttom of the joy stick is an added bonusand you can be assured ill be using this for mech warrior 5 Living legends when it comes out!"
4,pretty good product... maybe a little overpriced,"It is Leica, and a excellent camera. I compared it with my old Canon camera. Definately it has more feature and control. Lens doesn't seem to be sharp as I expected. Probably a little sharper than Canon. Generally, I am happy but I still think it is a little overpriced."
3,"She loves it, but...","""Santa"" brought this for my 2-year-old daughter in 2007, and she loved it immediately. She uses her laptop daily sitting next to me as I use mine, which was the plan. However, after about 6 months the keys became less responsive & after 7 months they did not respond at all. So, my daughter turns on her favorite toy and tells us over and over ""it's broken, fix it."" I have had no luck contacting FisherPrice. ""Santa"" will be bringing her a different brand laptop this year."
5,Love the Laughtop!,I bought this product for my niece and now for my daughter. It taught my niece how to identify her letters. My daughter is 18 months and she just likes to play with it now. She is pretty rough and it has stood the test of a toddler.
5,My Three Year Old Loves It,"It's very cute and very educational. The mouse isn't loose, so there's no chance of it getting pulled off. It is very kid friendly. My child's has been dropped and knocked and it still looks and works like brand new."
5,Great Toy!,"We bought this toy for my son's 3rd birthday. He is almost 4 now and it still gets used! He is learning letters everyday with it, and it has even helped him learn both the upper case and lower case letters. I like how it has 4 different functions, b/c even my 14 month old daughter plays with it on the music function. She loves it too. The phonics section is really the most educational at his age. When he was just turning 3 though, the letter function was best for letter recognition. The games aren't really that great, but I didn't get it for that reason anyway.Overall, it's been a great toy and very durable. The screen is a good size, it's easy to see, and the graphics are good too. I like that it has 2 levels for volume as well. It's not too loud! YEAH! I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend it to anyone who's child is still learning letters."
4,Review for Fun 2 Learn Laughtop Laptop,Seems to be made well to withstand abuse from my 2-yr-old. Nice that it has two volume levels. A great learning tool for toddlers and preschoolers. Way for them to associate letters on screen to letters on keyboard. Also teaches them how to control the mouse.
2,good toy with one little problem,"Someone got this toy for my son and he loves it and plays with it constantly. The complaint that I have is that every time the letter Q comes up, instead of the toy saying just the letter ""Q"" the toy says the sound and then the letter which come out like ""qua Q"" which sounds JUST like F**K Y*U!! the letter U comes out pretty much the same as ""UH U""My kid keeps repeating ""Qua Q"" all the time, even to strangers and I get the worst looks from people!!!I'd love to complain directly to fisher price but all they have is a phone number, no email, so I'm reluctant."
3,Enjoyable but runs out of steam towards the end,"I didn't anticipate that this would be a history book and so I wasn't disappointed that is wasn't. I enjoyed the book up through the last few chapters where, it seems to me, Unsworth lost his way. Having said that, I still enjoyed the book overall and am happy to have read it. I look forward to trying another of Unsworth's books."
3,A Sad Twisted Man But A Fascinating Premise,"I'm still in shock over the last page of Barry Unsworth's book, Losing Nelson. The premise of this ambitious book and the intricate weaving of characters are worthy of a this read, but I was very disappointed by the ending. The book started out with a depressed, compulsive and mentally debilitated character trying to save himself and ended with the same. A downer! Nelson's story was much more satisfying, personally and otherwise. The notion of heroes was dispelled - for the better! We do far better to add fuller dimensions to individuals!"
1,A waste of time!,"This game is one of the worst Sega Dreamcast games on the market today. If you buy it, your just wasting your money because there is no good levels, graphics, and the game is just terrible. So I suggest that you never buy this game."
1,You've got to be kidding,"""...chastity is doing sex in the Body of Christ."" Our reading group's monthly topic was sex. I tried to read a few parts of this book to the group. They couldn't take it, wondered which medieval convent the author came out of. This is not about real sex. It is about ways to avoid it to keep from feeling guilty. The book mixes up sinning, chastity, celibacy and sex, never clarifying, only obfuscating. Actually, even one star seems too much."
5,the best filter,"I have been using k and n forever. They keep the oil clean. I use Mobil 1 extended performance synthetic and change my oil once every 9k miles, even though mobil 1 says its good for 15k. The k and n oil filter works better than any other filters in the market. The higher price is worth the performance. Amazon sells these 5 bucks cheaper than most local stores. I drivea 2001 jeep grand cherokee 4.0 I6. Runs smoother since i switched to synthetiic. Btw, i also have a k and n air filter and the difference is significant. Great product."
5,Marvelous - how is it out of print so quickly?,"I don't think that the author is necessary conflicted between the Coleman and Goldman views of Lennon's life so much as looking from the outside, considering all possibilites without claiming to ""know"" anything. Not as good as A Hard Day's Write, true, but still a very excellent companion to Lennon's life and works."
1,Screen too dark,Even though this is a great PDA if you ever have to use it in poor lighting conditions you will strain your eyes to see anything. Basically the screen is dark so unless you are in front of a bright light you won't be able to see very much. I ended up returning mine.
2,loved it but left it,"purchased this pda from amazon (and they are FANTASTIC with service!) and was happy with it, till i had to use it at my father-in-laws home, with very poor lighting. couldn't read the screen! i'm returning it and at this point am not at all sure what i'll use to replace it. probably pen and paper for awhile!"
1,Save your money and buy a better book.,This is a poorly written book that recommends bad bets. I think you'd be better off putting your money in a slot machine than reading this.
2,Highly over-rated!,"I am a professional cake artist, and have of course heard of Sylvia Weinstock for some time. I was glad to finally have a chance to see some of her work. For someone with such a big reputation, the cakes were very disappointing. Most of the novelty-type cakes were fairly amateurish, and all the wedding cakes have the same basic design, iced smooth and smothered with gumpaste flowers. Seems like piping is definately not her skill. I expected much better quality in the flowers for someone so well known and who commands such high prices! I know many other cake artists whose flowers are much more realistic. Also, the directions were very vague and sometimes inconsistent. This is definately more of a coffee-table type picture book than a serious cake decorating book."
4,...still glad I have it,"Most of the comments are true...the author is keeping most of her secrets and does not give intructions for most of the cakes pictured. I like the book anyway because the cakes are beautiful, I admire Sylvia Weinstock as a cake decorator. Oh, before I forget...the hazelnut cake recipe is worth the price of the book, it have a very sophisticated flavor and the fillings and buttercream recipes are well detailed and delicious!!!!"
5,Artist with sugar,"Weinstock is a master, the Da Vinci of cake decorationg! Her presentations are gorgeous. The recipes included are straight-forward. Not recipes for the novice but even if you never try to make one of the cakes it is a beautiful and nicely written book. No wonder the very wealthy come to her when they want a special cake. If I could afford it I certainly would! This book is a gem."
5,The closest thing to the perfect console driving game,"This game's sole weakness, if it truly is one, is that about 98% of its functionality is locked until you begin winning races. The game includes dozens of vehicles, everything from station wagons to exotic sportscars, but there are only two that are initially playable, and these are intentionally mis-tuned. So casual gamers are likely to whine about control issues until they manage to unlock the better cars and/or the tune-up features. When you get to the Alfa Romeo or the Audi TT, you'll begin to realize that VP has, hands-down, the best driving engine ever built into a videogame, and that the game itself is a masterpiece. Great visuals, precise control and an amazing sense of speed. Perhaps the game is a bit more challenging in the early stages than it had to be, but those who persist will find the trip a rewarding one."
4,Almost Perfect,"First of all, not enough cars, and thats most of it. I gave it 4 stars couse of its handaling in cars and not enough cars. Its a good game overall."
5,Classic thrash metal for the collector,"I gave this album 5 stars because it really is a classic. Obviously it is not million-dollar production - no early 1980's metal was (not even Mettalica's ""Kill 'em all""). And it may be difficult for people to appreciate now, but at the time it was released it was an incredibly bold and assertive vision, and it truly gives an idea of the types of music that eventually formed what we now recognize as pure and classic thrash metal. Here Warrior and Ain show the seed of creative vision that eveitually led to Celtic Frost. For me, the album culminates in the heart-stopping Triumph of Death - a ""ballad"" that I still enjoy playing for the neighbors upon occasion."
3,Was It Tomorrow ? Or Will Be Yesterday ?,"Apocalyptic Raids album was the logic base were Thomas Gabriel Fisher and Martin Erick Ain had to develop the later Celtic Frost, cornerstone of Death Metal.Hellhammer were based on Black Metal very in the mood of Venom and some Motorheadesque influence, lyrics were honestly a little immature but the attitude is there at 100%.The sound is furious, lyrics kinda epic poetry, and the voice of Fischer is smashing, Ain bass is also very dense, hellhammer was the prelude something big were about to happen.HM"
3,Expensive.,"Very expensive toys. There is only one Mech per packaage and they load you down with useless tanks and infantry. I was excited when this game was first announced, but [the price] for the first Mech (in the starter set) and [the price] for each additional Mech in the boosters is outrageous. It will cost many hundreds of dollars to even think of fielding enough Mechs to play a game and you will be burdened with enormous quantitites of useless infantry and tanks in acquiring your Mech force.Also, watch out. The majority of the Mechs I've gotten seem to be Agromech, Mining Mech, Forestry Mech, and the like...not even real Mechs. The game is a major disappointment and I recommend everyone against it..."
5,Aaaaah & mmmmm!,"I heard the Claudia Quintet live once when I was visiting New York and I was completely into the music and the playing--and this CD is just as amazing! If you're into great music that has some funk, some jazz and something totally new, then definitely check this out. A lot of the music really has this way of drawing me into a beautiful intro or melody which then slowly builds, creating this irresitable tension and anticipation--and I am never disappointed when the band switches gears and grooves to some awesome rhythms and amazing solos. And the combination of instruments is totally unique! I mean, an accordion?! But it's amazing what these musicians can do...I could go on...But you should definitely hear it for yourself!"
3,WOW!,"Wow! Who new? I mean C'mon. Really now.I'll tell you what i thought of it.O wait, i haven't used it yet. OHH WELLTough luck people out there"
3,Rachael Ray 365,"I love Rachael Ray, but in this particular cookbook, the recipes are more complicated than I was hoping. Perhaps I should have bought one of her earlier cookbooks instead."
1,"Pretty face, can't cook","Yup, I said it.If you are a big fan of foods commonly found in 24-hour diners, then Ray's recipes are for you. I understand the need to make a quick and tasty meal when many of today's men and women are short on time, but resorting to using store bought chicken stock or pre-grated cheese in a bag? Just because you make it in the comfort of your own home doesn't make the meal home-cooked when most of the ingredients come pre-pocessed in a box or can. And yes, that includes pre-packaged vegetables!!! How healthy could the food possibly be when you are using peas and tomatoes already chopped up in a can??? Isn't this the kind of food served in diners???"
2,"Okay, not great","I bought this cookbook with no prior knowledge of Rachel Ray or her other cookbooks. The idea of 365 30-minute meals is appealing, but unfortunately, many of the recipes included take far more than 30 minutes if you include prep time. This is a useful cookbook for families as the yields are fairly large and it covers a variety of flavors. However, the flavors aren't always great; they are often combined in unappetizing mixtures that just don't work. The method of substituting ingredients to change up a dish is not terribly useful either. Most often, you will have to change half the recipe to get a new dish. The worst part, though, is the lack of a useful index. It's extremely difficult to find your way around the book. Just try looking for a ""chicken"" dish. If you don't know the title, chances are you won't find it fast."
3,Mom with very little time to cook,"As the mother of a one-year-old who's beginning to want to eat what Mommy and Daddy are eating (until now, too often fast food), I decided I'd better get into the habit of cooking at home. Since I work full-time, the idea of 30-minute meals had a lot of appeal. The recipes I've tried so far were delicious, but I was disappointed that, even with help in the kitchen, none of them has taken only 30 minutes to prepare--they've usually taken an hour or so. I'm not completely inexperienced in the kitchen, so I don't think it's just me being slow . . . maybe Rachel's prep is lightning fast. Also, the recipes are very gourmet, and many call for ingredients that you might not be able to find at your local grocery store. Guess I'll still have to do some more searching for true 30-minute meals (if they exist!)."
5,Rachael Ray is Awesome!,"Love most of her dinner selections. My favorite is the Pretzel Chicken. YUMMO! I think she could use a few more pictures, but maybe that's just me."
3,Its just ok.,"I was expecting more pictures. I love Rachael Ray's cooking, I think she has a better book out there."
4,Rachael Ray 365: No Repeats,"I collect cookbooks, and am glad to have this one in my collection. But it would have been so much better if a photo appeared on the facing page of each recipe so that we could see the actual results. Overall, it's a good guide for tasty and varied recipes."
4,Rachel Ray strikes again.........,"I didn't buy this cookbook for me but for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. She likes it but said that it really is a bit much and that sometimes, as much as she enjoys Rachel Ray, she gets tired of the same old, same old. I have two other Rachel Ray cookbooks so figure I have enough..."
4,4 and a half stars,"so far I have tried one recipe and it turned out well, the chicken and sweet potato curry. but some recipes require so many ingredients. for some i am lucky and have the ingredients she asks for.i suggest you pick a few recipes at a time and buy the ingredients in bulk so you don't have to go to the store everyday. i planned to make two chicken recipes and a potato salad with kielbasa. i spent 65 dollars on all the stuff for three recipes. almost a month worth of meals since i cook for two.i like this book for me but not sure if others will like it. but give it a try."
3,so so,I found this book hard to follow and the index was not very helpfull. This is her 10th book and it looks like bunch of her old recipes put together in a new book.
4,Very happy,Of course I was skeptical ordering a second hand book. But it was in excellent condition for theprice I paid. Looks brand new! I had to go thru the book 2-3 times to make sure that it was a secondhand book.No complaints! The book and recipes are good and easy!
3,365 what,I bought this book because everyone kept telling me how great Rachel Ray is. There were 365 recipes. It did appear they would be fairly quick to make. The problem was most of them were things my husband would never eat and several of them had ingredients we don't have nor could we find them when we asked in our local store. It may be good for someone else but for our meat and potato family it wasn't a hit.
3,It's okay,"After seeing Rachael Ray on ""The View,"" I got this book from our local library. I was disappointed to learn that the format of the book was extremely confusing. All the recipes were not categorized at all and in order to know what you would like to try or not, you have to read through the book from recipe 1 to recipe 366. In addition, I agree with one reviewer here that her strategy of substituting different ingredients to make a whole new dish was a bit confusing.That being said, there are a few recipes that I found in this book that seemed simple enough to try. Some of the recipes that Rachael Ray gave seems to me will definitely take more than 30 minutes unless you are a professional chef who has all the incredients ready and all preparation work done for you. I wouldn't recommend readers to purchase this book unless they think they can utilize most of her recipes."
4,Hit or Miss,"I have only cooked out of this Rachel Ray cookbook, but I must say, from my experience, her recipes are very much hit or miss. You could have an excellent meal one night and an awful one the next. I do use her cookbook alot, though, because I like to try cooking new things -- and her recipes are very creative. I have gotten some great ""staple"" dinner recipes from this book. Cooking from this book can be expensive, though, because most of her recipes require a lot of spices and herbs, etc. Overall, I think it's a pretty good book worth having on your shelf."
3,Okay book,Has alot of weird recipes that I would never try in it. If you like Rachel Ray's recipes then you would like this. I just wanted to try it and so far I think I wasted my money because I haven't cooked anything out of it.
5,Wife loved it!!!,My wife really liked this book. I got it for her for Christmas and she is ready to put the recipes to use!
4,Great recipes!,"I loved the mix of ethnic dishes - French, Indian, Spanish, etc., as well as the ease and speed of preparation for most of the receipes. My only suggestion would be to have more low-fat and vegetarian options, as so many of us are turning in that direction. On the whole though, great book!NOTE: The reviewer is the author of ""Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged."""
5,Cooking Challenged Dad,"Somewhere along the line, I decided to try my hand at cooking for my family. First, I started watching the Rachel Ray and Tyler Florence on the Food Network. Now, I'm starting to accumulate cookbooks and cooking utensils. As some have mentioned, this book isn't organized very well, but the index is good and to be honest, I enjoy browsing through the recipes to find the one I want to use.Others have complained that the recipes take more than 30 minutes. True enough, tonight I cooked Fish in a Sack. It took 45 minutes from start to sitting down for dinner. Really not that long when you think about it.My family loves the recipes and I'm finding I enjoy the process of learning to cook."
4,The best of her books,I own four or five of her books and this is the only one I really use. The recipes are really good. The only thing is that I wish she would've paired the main courses with side dishes because I'm really bad at it. Thank God my husband loves to eat :-).
2,Yaba Daba Doo!,"This book gives quite a few projects but to be quite honest most are quite hideous. I bought it originally to make hand felted flowers for my hats like the lily on the front cover. Alot of the projects I couldn't imagine anyone wearing (unless they say their child made it in kindergarten for Mother's Day like the mustard coloured, felted stone necklace - yaba daba doo!). Alot of the projects centre on having a glass lampwork bead on one end of a felt rope and then copying that bead on the other end in felted wool - it just looks stupid to me. The photos of other people's projects at the end have a couple of good ideas but that's about it. If making big, chunky lariats and necklaces with seed beads scattered over them is your thing then go for it - but quite honestly the clash of textures and scale just don't sit well with my eye."
3,Needs more instructional photos,"This book has some really nice and inspiring projects to do, but for anyone who has never worked with felting, but wants to, it is very hard to visualize the process. Step by step photos would be a big help. Otherwise, it's just frustrating."
3,Nice doll not worth 100.00,"Amazing Amanda was Christmas present for my daughter. She was very excited when she got her but she has only played with her a total of 5 times since Christmas. I didn't have any problems programming her, it only took about 10 minutes but Amanda is only supposed to recognize my daughter's voice but she will answer to anyone that talks to her. I love her facial expressions and she really does know what she wants but my daughter really doesn't find her interesting."
1,Amazing Amanda,"I have the peach version of this doll and it is annoying. I had to take my child into the bathroom where it was quiet and have her answer all the questions and she became very annoyed with that. Then the doll kept telling my daughter to say her name and when she did, the doll would say that she didn't recognize her mommy's name and would keep telling her mommy to say her name. Its very annoying and looks a bit possessed to be honest..."
1,Seriously? Voodoo?,"Ok, the members of the Matamoros cult did not practice voodoo, or any Afro-Caribbean religion. This point was made several times by the media after the trial, including in an article in US News & World Report. What the cult did practice was a made up religion heavily influenced by fictional horror movies about what the media perceives as voodoo, so way to perpetuate the cycle there, Schulze.""The power of voodoo is the power to live without conscious, totally beyond the bounds of normal human sanity""? Seriously? It sounds like something a teenager sitting around a campfire with a flashlight under his face would say.Also, Cauldron of Blood? Great title. Way to sensationalize a horrible tragedy."
1,My conversation with Fred Durst,"Me: Hey Fred, I have good news.Fred: You think my band's new album is intense metal and is awesome and you'll support us?Me: No, I just saved a buncha money on my car insurance by switching to Geico."
4,Welcome Back,"Seriously it was long awaited, if you like 3 dollar, you'll be fine... if you liked ""Nookie"" this ain't the one for you... I will close with I would buy part 2 if it ever came out just because I was impressed with this one!"
2,Why Fred?,"30 mins long is not a cd and where is ""Crack Addict"" and ""Just Drop Dead""? Also did you take apage out of WCW's playbook by calling your cd part 1 without intending to do a part 2?"
2,"Dump Fred, Find Zach.....","This album is sound musically, but Fred lacks as vocalist and song writer. He needs to rap a lot less and keep his voice toned down. Also his lyrics are garbage. That being said, Wes really has some good riffs on this album. ""The Truth"" sounds like Wes is channeling Tom Morello and I can't help thinking while I hear that song that it would be so awesome with Zach from RATM on vocals. The bass and drum work is fine and it seems the DJ has been pushed to the background more which is wrong. Incubus had it right on ""Make Yourself"" the DJ is a great tool for adding background bits and some things that cant be done on instruments, but he should never be a focal point. ""Propaganda"" is another good RATM type ripoff track. Wes really does a good job on this song of keeping it funky, but heavy.This cd would be a 3-4 star affair if they had different vocals with different lyrics. Dump Fred, find De La Rocha"
4,Heavier EP,"Let it be said that this album does not qualify as a full-length release...with 7 tracks totalling a mere 29:44, this is really more of an EP, but shows a heavier side of LB not really seen since their debut, 'Three Dollar Bill Y'All'...taken as an EP, this album does boast some strong songs, 'The Truth' is a furious rocker with the music and Fred's vocals greatly channelling Rage Against The Machine...but that being said, Wes's return does seem to have been for the better musically, as this is some of the strongest material the group has ever written, and the songs showcased here bodes well for future releases"
1,This Generation's Spinal Tap,"when my friend told me that the great Nine Inch Nails With Teeth is bundled with these Nu Metal has beens here,I almost had a heart attack.Its like fine vintage wine being sold with some cheap generic coke soda.Disgusting.NIN is the anti-Bizkit,a classic Alternative band with integrity and brains.And yes,I did listen to this garbage at a listening post in music store.This cd should be under comedy.Limp Bizkit is turning into generation y's Spinal Tap.again,its pretty pathetic that the only way Rappin' Freddie Durst can sell records these days is to hang onto Trent Reznor's coat tales."
1,"Yes, it is unquestionable.....Nu Metal is dead.","Limp Bizket was never good. Three Dollor Bill Ya'll was heavly overrated, and their second album was a joke, and I never bothered with Chocolate Star fish. Everything ablout this ablum is a joke, the riffs, the beats, and especially Freds, angsty, whiny and annoying vocals are the worst in recent music history. Another thing about this album is it's more or less a total rip off Rage (who suck as well). Everything about it, the lyrics, music (no solos, something Rage had), and even the cover art.In the end it comes down to this, Nu Metal/Rap Rock is dead, and has been for four years now. The new fad is ""Gothencore"" Metalcore bands such as Trivium and Kill Switch Engage. Perhaps if Limp want's to be popular again, they will switch to that style."
1,.....,"Fred...No wait, thats all I need to say because nobody cares anymore......And besides, Fred has been with too many guys..."
4,The Return of the Bizkit,"This CD will grow on you. The first time I listened to it, I played it on my computer and I thought it was decent. Then I listened to it in my car, and I have a good system with subwoofers. That made a big difference and the songs sound a lot better. I was impressed with their new sound, and the lyrics were a lot better. I like all 7 songs on the cd, but my favorites are The Propaganda, The Priest, The Channel. The Key would have been a very good song if it would have been longer. If Part 2 is as good or better than this..LB is back for good, and all the haters can stop hating. 4/5"
5,THIS is Limp Bizkit??,"Ok .. wow.Before I even contemplate buying a CD, I always read the reviews.The reviews for this CD generally would have pushed me away from even downloading the songs, BUT I said to myself ""Self, what have you got to lose?"" So I bought it and holy crap was I surprised.I recommend this for anyone that likes some damn good music.In my opinion neither the lyrics nor the music sound NOTHING LIKE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE.I guess people that grew up ""true"" fans were expecting another ""nookie"" cd. But oh well ... I would take this over ""nookie"" anyday."
1,Fred Worst is the worst,Anyone who listens to this mockery of metal deserves to ummmm lets see.......die. This is the type of garbage I would play for my worst enemy just to torture him even further.
3,Seriously...,"Sorry ""Steve"", but if you bought Results May Vary, and ""loved every song on the CD"", you're not a LB fan to begin with. That was not LB, it was just LB digging themselves further into the overexposure/cliche hole they started when Nookie was released. Unorganized, choppy riffs? Maybe you should stick to Def Leppard or some other hair bands with some nice long solos for you to enjoy.I honestly don't know if I can stand Fred's voice for any longer than 29 minutes, so I was glad to see how short the album is. Instrumentally, I like the aggressive simplicity of the tunes, and while I don't think I can really get into LB again, overall this was a nice effort and at least a step in the right direction. Hopefully, they'll keep looking forward to progress musically instead of financially, like they did with their last couple albums."
4,Um. Wes changed the style into Rage Against Machine,littlebit of incubus + Rage Against Machine.Where is just fun limp bizkit???
3,We Should Listen to Fred...,"And pick up the new NIN With_Teeth because it truly is an amazing album like Durst says it is. But anyways, when I first listened to the Unquestionable Truth I thought it had some catchy hooks and Wes definitely turns it up a notch on this record. If he didn't return Limp would definitely be dead! Other than that the lyrics are still not up to what I want to see on a Bizkit album but Durst does an O.K. job. It was better than what I expected with all these reviews slamming this album."
5,Bizkit's finest?,"I don't normally give any album 5 stars - but I felt so strongly about this album, I felt it deserved this score. I have been a casual fan of Limp bizkit, and would rate their stuff before this as average/in the boundary of excellent. But they have perfected their formula this time, and I love their new, darker, sound. Thanks to a change in directiona nd Wes' return, Limp Bizkit is finally back on the rails again."
1,Dissapointing,"I bought ""Results May Vary"" (the previous album) as my first Limp Bizkit album. I thought I was a new Limp Bizkit fan. I loved every song on the CD. Fred Durst sang well and the melodies were extremely creative and addicting. The guitar was amazing and the unique time changes really amazed me. As a newly found Limp fan, I bought this new EP at first sight. Well, I totally wasted my money. I can't even begin to describe how dissapointed I am in this latest release. Wes Borland is back with the band and his riffs sound so choppy and disorganized. No more melodic tones, no more singing. Fred Durst just raps his way through all the crazy out of place guitar. It sounds like they have this Rage Against the Machine influence, and it's so out of place for Limp. This album stinks...soooo bad. I'm either selling it to a used CD store, burning it, or trashing it...just as long as I don't have to listen to it or see it again. I'm officially an ex-Limp fan."
1,Dont Buy this album!!,"After listening to this album, I woundered if it took more than a day to write. The last 5 Limp Bizkit albums have been good rock/rap records with quailty music and great musical ideas. This new album is nothing but mindless dribble. The cover art, and the idea of the first track, are total rip-offs of Green Days's success of ""American Idiot."" I mean Fred has never voiced a politcial view until now.. come on bad, get your on ideas.. instead of your ripping off your peers. And the music of the rest of the album sounds like a bad Rage Against the Machine cover-band trying to write their own music. I say pass on this one and wiat for the next album, which by record sales, will show the band to go back to the orginal formula, which worked."
2,Gid Rid of Durst!,"After listening to this so-called album I have figured out what needs to happen, the guys in Limp Bizkit need to kick Durst out of his own band. Either that or pull an Alter Bridge and leave Durst and find a real metal vocalist. Musically this cd rocks harder than any of the other crap they've released, but it's RUINED by Durst's whiney rap vocals.With a good singer this band would be killer, but with Durst it sounds really pathetic.Will give props to ""The Truth"", even Durst couldn't ruin this smokin' track."
1,Limp Bizkit is over,"This cd was released with no promotion (none that Ive seen) and its been out for almost a month. This is should tell Limp that fans are over there music, getting Wes back doesnt mean anything. Durst is now a joke, and if he gets a reailty serious-well that'll never happen. Just like the second part to this cd shouldnt happen. But then again, who would know considering no one knew this album was released."
2,Loose Fred and we'll talk,"You guys gotta drop Fred if you want to be taken seriously again. The instrumentals are decent, but the vocals are God awful, effortless, monotone. I'd be pissed if my vocalist ruined all my songs like that."
1,Did not receive this book,"I waited a month for this book, sent emails regarding my order, and heard nothing back. I have filed a claim against this seller through Amazon."
3,"Well designed, but poorly made. Sorry, it's a ""cheap Sony""","It's a well designed but relatively poorly made notebook. The LCD screen is beautiful and the stereo is impressive. The design and display are totally ""Sony"". However, the external material is very cheap. The body shows a visible bending with just a little push by fingers.The one I got might also be a defect, since the battery doesn't attach well with the notebook. It makes pretty loud ""click"" sounds when I put it on my lap, or even when I walk around with it in my backpack!It's ridiculous. For a brand new notebook that cost about $1300, it's a joke. So, I sent it back the next business day.Also, the power cord is very short. I did not measure it, but it's a lot shorter than my old Dell notebook, which is just about average length."
1,"Built like Crap, False Sense of Security","Bought it to keep my 3 year old in the house. I've busted 2 of these things opening the door after forgetting to unchain this lock.There is a crap rivet that holds the head of the part that goes into the slider. I am not the Hulk, this thing wouldn't keep my grandmother out of the house if she pulled on it!"
1,Flimsy,"Wanted to get a nickel door chain, and was unable to find one in stores. Ordered this V807 Door Chain.It is very flimsy metal. Bought one about 10 years ago, also nickel colored. This one is sturdy and thechain fits well into its parking spot when it is not in use. The V807 rests in a wobbly way when parked.The older chain cost less than this one. The price remains about the same, but the quality has suffered over time."
4,An OK mp3 player - but not for this price,"The downside - the 16mb cards store next to nothing, and the coveted 64MB MultiMedia card will cost more than 2x the price of your player! Bottom line: can be gotten cheap, but expect to pay an arm and a leg for memory if you wish to olay more than 3 mp3 songs/16MB card. I would wait until Sensory Science Rave 2300 (with great cheap 40mb memory modules) drops down to reasonable price range."
3,Magellan 860T,"Once you get past the abysmal instructions on how to use it, the unit works reasonably well. I have disagreed on numerous occasions with how to get from here to there, but the instructions would have been OK for someone not familiar with the area. Unit mounts well in my cars. Volume not loud enough to use ear pieces on my motorcycles. Am trying to hook sound into the cycle sound system."
3,Ok/Good,This trail mix is pretty good but tastes really sweet. I can only eat about half a bag of the mix before feeling nauseated. You should defiantly try a single package before buying in bulk.
1,RUINED by a line!!!!,"This song could have easily been a great r&b; ballad but that possibility was ruined by this lyric: ""Tear you into little pieces, swallow you like Reces Pieces....""No matter how you slice it, this lyric does not bode well for a love song. It is not romantic and really does not convey love in my book. I won't say the song sounds cannibalistic, it just goes over like a lead balloon. The music was good, the singing was good and for the most part the lyrics were good but having to hear that dreadful line everytime I heard this song made it off limits."
5,I wish I had this book twenty years ago.,"My ""happy"" marriage was failing and I had no clue as to why. Both this book and ""The Power of a Praying Wife"" opened my eyes and truly revealed to me what I had been doing wrong for so many years. This was a book that I couldn't put down, but also at times, had a hard time reading because I felt it was leading me to take on a role that would lose myself to me. But it's a book full of biblical truth and has truly transformed me into a stronger woman who's marriage now has hope when there was none. I'm a better woman for it and feel I truly am serving God by being the kind of wife the bible teaches us to be, rather than a wife that society has created. I am a Godly wife, my family is intact and the man I love is still my husband, my marriage is blessed. This book taught me and transformed my life. I haven't lost who I am at all, I am better and much more blessed because of it."
1,Credibility is a problem.,"The trouble with this book is that the author has squandered any credibility he once had. I could see someone like Herb Greenburg writing this type of book, at least he would be taken seriously, but Cramer has been a cheerleader for the market for years and is hardly in a position to tell anyone why they got screwed."
4,A Little Bit of Cramer,"This very short book is pure Cramer. Enjoyable reading. He tells it like it is and places blame for the market collapse of the past three years. This book is really an opportunity for Cramer to complain about the past and to warn investors not to be duped again. For me the highlight is that he posts a list of his personal investments on a web site, and encourages readers to consider copying him to achievce a balanced and safer portfolio.If Cramer had added the suggestion to write covered calls (see THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS) to enable investors to have even safer stock portfolios, this book would have been more valuable"
1,Why Is He On TV? Avoid.,"Why did the SEC never investigate this guy? A book about him mentions how he supposedly would tell Maria B on CNBC little news tips and news ""sccops."" She would parrot them and he would sell on the news.He also loved Internet stocks and was pumping Martho Steward's stock after the news came out about her insider trading. The stock then tanked. Avoid this guy. Why Kudlow does a show with him is beyond me."
3,not for experts,"If you work on Wall Street, you already know everything in this book. If you don't and watch CNBC only accidentally, then buy this book. Vintage Cramer, acerbically enlightening."
2,A Thinly-Veiled Advertisement for James J. Cramer,"To learn what Cramer knows about recent swindles (now, after the fact) or what financial products Cramer ""sells"", read this book. Cramer does a great job of beating you down, then offering to be your personal savior._____________________________________________________________So this is what I had to say about Cramer a year ago, and now I'm a total Cramer junkie. His radio show (...) is the best source of timely, unbiased, practical information I have found in 20 years of investment AND IT'S FREE. Jim is right most of the time, but he also is the first to admit when he has made a mistake.Thank you, Jim, for giving me the courage to fire my broker, improve my investment performance, and save $25,000/year in fees."
3,"Candid, but too little too late.","Cramer is candid in this book, but, unfortunately, it is too little too late. It would have been a pretty good read had this book come out three years ago. At this point, however, does anyone really need to be told that Enron and World Com were companies fraught with fraud. Is anyone out there still so naieve that he/she is not aware that Wall Street is plagued with charlatans and shenanigans."
4,"Concise, To-the-Point, Straight-Talk, In Layman's Terms","If the average Joe wants to know--in layman's terms--how the Wall Street establishment FUBARed his 401(k) accounts, mutual funds, and other stock investments, this book is a must-read. It has the same good information that Levitt included in ""Take on the Street"", minus the hundreds of pages of self-promoting CYA.Cramer's wit will make your blood boil.Whether it's Jack Grubman and the Worldcom shenanigans...the Rhythm Net fiasco...the Enron fraud...Sunbeam...the list goes on, Cramer pulls no punches.When one looks at the winners and losers in Cramer's book, it turns out to be helpful:Winners: the average investorLosers: Wendy Gramm, Jack Grubman, Andy Fastow, and anyone who was in bed with them."
1,Do not buy this printer,"I bought this printer for my 85-yr-old mother to use with her iMac (OS 9.2). From the outset, there were problems. The drivers provided on the CD did not load properly, and the printer has never printed the way it should. I had to download drivers from the Canon website, which did not work either. Getting support from Canon was close to impossible and we are now going to junk a printer that ultimately printed a grand total of no more than 100 pages in its short demented life. I am not a helpless computer user, but I have never encountered so many problems with a printer. Maybe ours was a lemon, but I would not recommend this printer."
1,Warning: Print heads fail very quickly!,"The BJC 2100 uses an ink cartridge (part BC-21e) which contains the print heads, and also holds the ink tanks. According to Canon's web site, the BC-21e is supposed to last for 4000 pages, or 20 ink tank replacements. Before you buy this printer, do yourself a favor, and see user comments for the BC-21e replacement cartridge. Mine failed after about 250 pages and while it was only on the 2nd ink tank! Several others report replacing between 3-5 tanks. The cost is about $50, which approximately equals the purchase price with the mail-in rebate! Have had no trouble with Epson printers, but would not buy another Canon."
1,Couldn't be any worse,"I'll never buy another Canon printer again. I recieved this useless pile of junk as a wedding gift. It refused to print. At all. No test sheets, nothing.So I PAID to call their inane tech support to fix THEIR problem. Spent an hour on the phone. The result? I get a ""factory refurbished"" printer in exchange for my new one. As I expected, the factory refurbished unit failed shortly after the 90 day warranty expired. At least I didn't pay for this piece of rubbish."
1,Good Printers- Bad Service,"I have a BJC-3000 that has worked fine for 6 months and out of the blue has started jamming. I have had similar problems with the other BJC models.I called Canon and they first wanted me to include a copy of the receipt, so if you ever want service, save your receipt.The waranty on these printers is ""select exchange"" and not an advance exchange. They will not send you the replacement printer first, unlike other manufacturers, you have to box up your printer, send it to them and they will send you a refurbished printer. The whole process takes 3 days if you overnight the printer to them. So, if you need a printer quickly, drop your Canon in the trash and go buy an HP or Lexmark."

4,"Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man--Moody, Meditative, Magnetic","John Fahey plays this live set on an electric guitar, which became his usual instrument in his last half decade. Other reviewers have commented on the overall tempo. I too find the playing relatively slow, but in a meditative sense, not footdragging; mild syncopation here and there, never leaden, dull, or frustrating. Fahey's talents are still here, but in a different voice.Georgia Stomps, Atlanta Struts, and Other Contemporary Dance Favorites both recaptures some of the relaxed, exploratory assurance of what I cherish as Fahey's best, 1960s work, and it forges new ground without an iconoclastic attack on his creative past. Riffing on Dock Boggs indeed. Unlike some of his other late-period albums, where the experimental noise won out, I think Georgia Stomps lends itself to repeated listenings and deeper appreciations. If you want a better-than-representative example of John Fahey's later recorded works, then this one will do nicely."
5,Great splinter removal,I manage a swim and tennis club and these are the best for getting out the many splinters that kids get there. I highly recommend them especially for public places since they are each individually wrapped and you don't have to worry about breaking someone's skin with something that has been used before!
1,more like the worst of bob welch,this is in no way his best. as a fan for years these were the worst best of choices ive ever seen besides the johnny van zant collection.precious love was the only good choice. what about three hearts?here comes the night or oh jenny? lots of ballads and not the up tempo groovin tunes hes known for. two thumbs down but bob still rules.
1,Romance is only for those who enjoy self inflicted pain!,Another loser by a well known author you would expect a greatread from. Save yourself the money. Save yourself the time.Save yourself thesuffering.
5,What a score - brilliant!,"At first - I must admit - listening to the selected parts on the amazon page I was wildly disapointed because there didn`t seem to be anything melodic on it. And it didn`t sound like a Strouse score but then I got to know it better by playing it myself on the piano and I was overwhelmed by the beauty of these melodies. Don`t trust these few selections presented on amazon. No doubt, this is not ""Annie"" or ""Bye Bye Birdie"" but it is brilliant in its very own way."
3,First rate beginning that slows down,"I would actually give this novel 3 1/2 stars. The first 50 pages are commanding, making this reader think of Graham Greene on one page and Lawrence Durrell on another. However, some of the writing in the second half seems too au courant in lingo and pacing. Some jarring point of view switches and a rushed conclusion cause this strong novel to miss its initial ascent into the upper echelon.A good read nonetheless."
