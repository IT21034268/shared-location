4,A good quick yet perceptive look at PR.,"Of the several books I have perused concerning PR/publicity, I found this one to be one of the most helpful. In concise terms, Slack gives us a worthy primer of an often neglected area. In addition, the book is laid out as a workbook, to help YOU assess your organization's grasp of the subject. It was very helpful in starting a publicity plan, and the format helped make it easy to teach the concept to others.This is for the people that don't want a degree in PR, and don't want to hire someone who does. It will give you a great running start, lifting you above much of the confusion in the discipline."
3,More cheese please!,"Only the truly dedicated fan of bad 1950s SF movies will enjoy this movie. At best it's a prime drive-in cheesefest, at worst a poor social commentary.Sexist scientists go underground only to find a society of teeny-eyed, chalky colored people (they must have cornered the market on clown-white makeup) terrified of light and subsisting on mushrooms grown by abused creature-slaves. They find and fight over the only blonde (naive bimbette, of course), tick off the ""High Priest"" and instigate the uprising of the slaves. The ending is twisted and unexpected.Pure hokum fun greatly enhanced by the MSK3000 version, includes the obligatory liturgical dance number, but still good for some laughs by itself."
1,"terrible dvd, no entertainment value for adults or children","This was a truly horrid dvd. I thought it would be entertaining to watch anything Victor Borge did, because of his gentle comedic genious, but this story-reading is awful and boring for kids and adults alike. I really couldn't watch the whole thing."
1,Very poor quality,I was sent this as a gift. Nice thought as they are not cheap but I have to say the knife quality is very poor. They don't hold thier edge and unless you dry them 100% they rust overnight. A sign of very cheap far eastern rubbish. Spend your money on a proper set rather than acheaply mde gimmick. Very disapointed.
3,Clever Design that was Cheaply executed and Over-priced,I just love the design! So cute! Great gift not only for those with an ex but also for Dexter fans! Unfortunately it was poorly crafted so that the knife sheaths don't stay attached to the body. The bread knife doesn't go into its sheath cleanly The knives also don't seem like stainless steel or any sort of material that I would want to touch the food I am going to put in my mouth or serve to loved ones. Apparently they made a version 2 which costs twice as much and is made to be practically used but I don't see it listed here on Amazon at the time that I am writing this review.
1,"Great idea, terrible execution","The Ex 5-Piece Stainless-Steel Knife Set with Unique Holder, Red Looked great in the shop window in Paris, thought it was heavy fiberglass or ceramic... for 150 Euros I let it pass. Great price $69.95 on Amazon resulted in ordering one, despite reviews that warned of it's plastic flimsiness. Well it is flimsier & more cheapo hollow lightweight plastic then I could ever have imagined from looking at it. This thing couldn't possibly stand up to a month of normal use... cheap cheap cheap looking & feeling. Didn't even bother to unpack the knives before returning it. Great idea, terrible execution, if you'll pardon the expression."
4,Great idea!,"Gave it 4 stars just bc I haven't purchased it, but would love to one day. I love the idea, it'd be a great conversation starter during friend visits. I definetly don't understand why the hell people are complaining saying it promots ""violence"" lol especially sayin it promotes violence against men...who said its a man? Its a stick figure! Called ""the ex"" not ""ex boyfriend"" get over urselves people! If ur gonna complain bout a knife stand, than we all should probably get rid of all the violent games out there, violent music, violent movies, etc...jeez."
1,disappointment,"after having bought the excellent ""Gil Elvgren: All His Glamorous American Pin-Ups (Taschen Editions)"" by Charles G Martignette Dr. and Louis K. Meisel, I thought this one would be as good as that. But this time, for the first time, Taschen Editions disappointed me; it's a really cheap item, of very bad taste. I understand that there's a lot of nostalgy involved and I can understand that people who lived in those times (50's and 60's) may find something pleasant on it, probably more for the atmosphere the book can evoke in their memories than for the quality of its contents. But if you're looking for good paintings and good motives for your own paintings as it was my case, forget it. At least it wasn't expensive; and surprisingly, the Elvgren's book I mentioned before costs exactly the same at Amazon, for real good american pin up ART, instead of bad taste.1000 Pin-Up Girls (25th Anniversary Special Edtn)1000 Pin-Up Girls (25th Anniversary Special Edtn) [Paperback]"
3,Good drawings by Peter Dreben,Lot's of pictures and good drawings by Peter Dreben. The book is quite thick for a small size so it's difficult to keep it open without holding it's pages apart. My particular interest is on the drawings but the photos show an eroticism from a time long gone... Good fun. The whole is worth the relatively little price you pay for it.
5,Tattoo,Great inspiration for an upcoming tattoo. The book delivers a lot of pictures. This is great for anyone who loves pin-ups.
2,Copy of a book,"Contrary to to the description title this is not a reprint, this is a photo copy of the original book. Much of the book is hard to read due to blurred or faded letters and pictures. I can't tell you how good of a read the book is as the print quality caused me to have to quit reading it shortly after I started reading it. The blurred pictures made it impossible to follow the text in the included figures. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COPY OF A BOOK!"
2,Terrible Disappointment,"This book was a terrible disappointment. I got it because we saw him on TV and he was a lively presenter and made things look easy. Unfortunately, the book did not live up to the presentation. The photos and diagrams are so dark as to be indecipherable, especially the ones showing the brushstrokes which are the most essential information. Without being able to see and understand the diagrams, the text is not very helpful at all. Even the cover photo is much darker than depicted. Here on the computer it looks light and lively... in the reality, it looks dull and grim. I would have wanted to try another of his books, but since the photo of the cover and the actual cover are so different, I would have no confidence that the inside of another book would be any better."
2,boxed set please,"this was one of my favorite shows, then it was taken away with no warning. please please please give the true fans the boxed set, not just a few episodes."
5,Wow. Finally.,"This summer I watched the scratchy, almost-ten-years-old tapes of My-So Called Life that I made off of the reruns MTV played of it. I got sucked back in all over again, despite the fact that the tapes skipped and the audio quality was horrible. Then when I was done, I wrote in my journal, ""I really want to know who Angela Chase became. She's me- she's a whole generation of me's at 15. Would she be us at 22?""We'll never know for sure, but at least I can finally see it the way it originally aired- able to hear Jordan's song without it warbling, able to watch all the multitude of times that Angela cried, able to be sent back in time to when Rayanne's outfits were actually kind of cool.I will be the first person in line to buy this on November 19."
5,when you buy one you have to buy them all,perfect educational tools for the young....watched this growing up........so glad that it's still available for my children to watch.....awesome video
4,Birthday present for daughter...,"Came on time, in fact, on day we celebrated birthday! Teenager loves to drink hot tea and is very pleased with product.No problems to date."
3,"Good selection of songs, but poor sound quality",I was disappointed with this album. I purchased La Historia De Un Idolo vol. II and thought I would have similar listening experience but the sound quality is not very good. Save your money or purchase another album.
1,Under the Influence,Never received item. Ordered 9/15 now 10/17. Need to know if I am actually going to receive UNDER THE INFLUENCE staring Keaneau Reeves in 1986 edition.Do not want substitute.for Mountain Cove High School Library.
5,The ONE...,"All Mepps spinners are strong and effective for fishing trout in the river, if you find the right color pending conditions of the particular river you are fishing in. The ones without a tail are simpler and have actually proved more efficient at times. Mepps, for me, is by far the best -- you can find pale versions that work but I have been very loyal."
5,Painful but gripping,Casper Andreas's other films are lighthearted. This one is not. But I think maybe it's his best (so far...). Intelligent and intense.
3,"Not for the ""hopelessly romantic""","A couple of reviewers have summarized the film quite well . . . there is a lot of pure bitchiness and the level of vitrol is enough to make one's stomach churn. But the edginess of the film and the ""oh, I soooo want this to turn out well even though I know it probably won't"" feeling that grows to a climax is perfectly in tune with LIFE. It is not the FILM which gives gay life a bad name, since the film is merely a reflection of what happens all too often. The dialog isn't the greatest, but is MUCH better than that seen in a lot of the films released since the mid 1990s! I'll probably watch it again . . . in about 7 years."
1,OH DEAR ! ANOTHER CLICHED YAWN,"Here we go again. Another cliched gay film , badly written, corny and very predictable. The acting was good at least. We have seen it all before many times- boy meets boy-they fall in love then encounter the usual problems. Story gets confusing towards the end- do they still love each other? You wouldn't know by the film's confused state of emotions.One minute the hate is intense and a second later at least one character does not seem to know."
2,Unnecessarily Uncomfortable Collar,"The shirt looks fine but the wearer reports that the collar is a bit higher than those on his other tux shirts, making it unnecessarily uncomfortable. We realize the collar must be stiff but the cut could be better.Also, it's poly/cotton but can't be worn without ironing."
2,not so refreshing pop music,"I had heard so many good remarks on this band I decided to check them out. Unfortunately I was very dissapointed to find out their music is in fact very outdated. They sound like the female version of Mikel Erentxun after he left the great Duncan Dhu and started writing cheesy pop songs. For more avant-garde spanish music check out Gustavo Cerati's Bocanada. And for a great fusion of latin sounds check out Manu, Dusminguet, Macaco, Radio Tarifa, Sergent Garcia and Fabulosos Cadillacs."
5,One of the best albums ever made,"El Viaje De Copperpot is one of the best recordings ever made, its a shame that this band is not being recognized by the Grammys at all, especially when they have had such a huge impact with their songs in Spain and Mexico, Cuidate, Paris, Soledad, Dicen que Dicen, La Chica del Gorro Azul and Mariposa are some of their best songs, but La Playa has to definitely be one of the best Spanish ballads ever written, it has so emotion behind u will just want to hear it over and over again, overall a great album that will become more famous in time. Definitely worth buying, no one will regret it."
5,beautiful baby-bonding & wonderful for re-entry into the world of exercise postpartum,"you're not gonna form buns-of-steel with this video, but that's not the point. those first few weeks (and months) postpartum is a time of immense recovery. it's almost as if you have to relearn how to move in your body and this gentle dvd is perfect for that. i started using this video about 8 weeks after the birth of my first child and really wish i had started using it earlier. the music is catchy. the instructor is very sweet. you can do a 5 minute song or the whole dvd. best of all, it's wonderful and guided way to connect with your baby & your body in those early and exhausting first days. (and as a bonus it usually puts little ones to sleep). highly recommend it!"
5,How Hip Mamas Can Get Their Groove Back,"We had the great pleasure of hosting Darcy's chicken groove session at Playdate Cafe in San Anselmo. She rocked our crib and the mamas were positively glowing after their work-outs. If you're looking for a work-out to get your pre-baby body back or simply want to share the joy of creative movement with your child, your search is over. Highly recommended for any caregivers who need a little pick-me-up!"
5,Favored to win is a favorite!,"I just read Favored to Win, and wish she would make a sequel to the book. Being a horsewoman myself, I identified with all the characters and feel that I know them like an old friend. MaryAnn truly is a gifted writer and I love her books. She captures horse racing like no one else. I never wanted to put the book down! She makes you feel as if you are watching a movie in your head. I absolutly loved this book, I hope she makes a sequel for it!"
1,Needs re-design,"This thing needs a re-design. It's using last generation LEDs. They're not very bright and are un-focused. I compared this unit to a minature LED flashlight with new generation LEDs and one-tenth of the battery mass. I couldn't see how cooked my steak was with the Zelco practically sitting right on top of the meat, but the minature flashlight from 3 feet away showed that it was still rare.I'm returning this unit immediately."
3,The Ultimate Step Workout is not so ultimate,"I found this video to be very difficult for someone who is just learning step. The cues were given while the people were moving, not before they moved. That type of instruction tends to throw people off. Also, the movements were very fast and jerky. This video might be beneficial for experienced steppers, but not for beginners. Beginners might want to try one of Jane Fonda's videos. I just bought one and it is much easier to follow."
2,Not my favorite,"I consider myself to be a fairly advanced step aerobic fan and bought this tape b/c of the other reviewers' positive comments. I was dissapointed.I found Ms. Roberts cueing to be fairly inept and she uses her own idiosyncratic naming of fairly common step sequences which add to the difficulty of following along. In addition, it seemed the choreography to be repetitious and dull.However, you will get a good workout aerobically and I thought the stomach routine to be one of the best, with good instruction in proper technique."
1,SANFRANSICKO,"Rarely has a movie about a serial killer been so dull and lifeless, and so horribly written and acted. SANFRANPSYCHO showcases the absurd murders of a religious fanatic who is killing people to cleanse them. As embodied by muscular non-actor Jose Rosete, this killer is so banal and unbelievable, one can only laugh at his histrionics...especially when he has a 60 second or more scene of masturbating over the heroine's coffee mug. Joe Estevez continues to demonstrate he didn't get any acting lessons from brother Martin Sheen---he is awful as the police detective assigned to the crime. There is hardly any action in the movie, and it just plods along to its ridiculous conclusion. Avoid at all costs."
3,Bought these for the HCG Diet,"I bought these for the HCG Diet... Very similar to soda crackers. These are very thin crispy breadsticks. I opted to buy soda crackers for my next go round, not nearly as expensive."
2,DVD Let's get lost,"The DVD Chet Baker, Let's get lost, may be good however, I received the european version(region 1) so I could not view it.I didn't read the fine print.I am hoping that Amazon will alert me when the American version (region 2) becomes available."
4,Works Great - Overpriced,"We bought this for wedding photography. Looking at past review it seems there was an issue with the plastic tabs that hold the batteries. Not sure if Canon upgraded those but the tabs I have are each 6 millimeters (1/2 inch) thick and it seems it would take a lot to break one of them. The overall construction seems rather sturdy and I don't think it would break if dropped. But that's really not an issue as everything fits nicely into a padded pouch that can be strapped to your belt, or carried in a bag at your side. If you drop it (while in that pouch) from 10 feet onto concrete there would be no damage.Other than those issues everyone seems to agree on the increased recycle performance and shoot times of your speedlites because of this product. That's what it was made for, if you are reading this then buy it. It works, and it's sturdy."
3,Solar Print Kit,I guess that I did not understand this kit was not the kit the refill kit would match. Since I can not use this kit with the refill kit I am alittle disappointed. I still have to go out and purchase the plexiglass so that I could us the paper in the refill kit.
2,NO paper included,I got this kit for my grandson and he loved it so ordered one for my granddaughter. The kit had no paper in it. It was a major disappointment because of that. She was looking forward to it.
2,Could have used a thicker Cable,"Nice design, cute little lock,I wouldn't expect anything really valuable to still be there when I got back if this lock was all that was holding it on there. Could probably clip this wire with a pair of toenail clippers. Might work as a deterrent against good-natured criminals that only steal things that aren't locked at all."
1,GARBAGE,"Received to use as a bicycle lock for my son's bike. After about three months, the cable and latching end piece on it rusted, the release button would not press down anymore and the retracting mechanism would only retract half way, until you had to manually try to stuff it back in. Too much of a bother, especially for an eight year old, pure garbage. Very disappointed in the cheapness of product."
1,Causes Cancer/birth defects,On the back of the package is a small sticker that says there is material contained in this item known to cause cancer and birth defects in California...not a good idea if you want to use it with a baby and a stroller.
4,Good for traveller,the cable is long enough but I think the size is too big to carry. Thanks for fast shipping!
1,Does not work,"I bought this to lock my expensive stroller when out at museums etc. It would not lock, I could open it with a gentle tug."
4,Very handy,"I used this to lock our kayaks up when we were dropping off cars and it worked very well. The lead of the cable was small enough to go thru the current hole in the kayaks so I didn't have to drill an additional one just for the lock. There was an issue with the retraction when it got cold, 23, but when it warmed up the cable went right back in. Several members of our kayaking club have purchased these and are also very happy with them. Small enough to slip in a dry bag or your pocket."
1,be careful,"This software almost wiped out my disk on my Mac OS X completely when I ran Disk Doctor. Fortunately, it was saved by Alsoft's Diskwarrior 3.0."
2,Not worth the money,We initially purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It is very cute but very flimsy and the bar/handle would not hold the seat in a sitting position (it kept slipping). I ended up finding another doll carseat at a store and ended up giving that one to her instead. We will be returning this one.
2,Lexar JDCL1GB-231 Jumpdrive,"After only 2 weeks of having the item, the part that allows you to put the jumpdrive on your key chain broke, therefore, it is of no use to me without being able to carry it on my key chain."
2,a disappointment,"I saw Engelbert in concert for the first time earlier this year at the State Theater in Cleveland. Enge was amazing as he sang each song with relative ease BUT the major fault of the concert in Cleveland as well as the cd/dvd is that it was badly mixed. The music overpowers his awesome voice at times. At the concert in Cleveland, when he spoke between songs, the audience had to be quiet to hear what he was saying and that was still a challenge. With a voice like Engelbert's even at his age, he can still sing a beautiful song and doesn't need it hidden behind massive drums or arrangements. Compare this concert to the one from the London Palladium from a few years back and you'll hear the difference.Don't get me wrong...Engelbert can still sing but this cd is not worth paying full price."
5,from Tampa Tribune review 2/6/05,"""...HOLDING HANDS AT MIDNIGHT is quite simply a wonderfully written memory piece. Part love letter to a myriad of women, part historical/autobiograhical novel and part nostalgic ode to the cities he has encountered.""-- Tampa Tribune"
5,awesome I want to read more!,I think this book has all kinds of mystic and interesting turns and is delightful at the same time. I'm almost jealous that I didn't grow up in Louisiana and that I don't have lifelong friends living close to me. I read this book first and I'm wondering if I'm reading them in the wrong order. Are they good like that?
1,mindless drek. an embarrassment to intelligent readers.,"This was a complete waste of paper. I absolutely hated this book & am shocked that it was even published. What's more alarming is that it's a bestseller. I agree that most of the women I know who love this book are superficial & as annoying as the ""people"" in this inane book. Too many cliches & the silliest, stupidest dialogue I've ever read. Popular fiction at its worst!"
5,Surpasses 'Little Altars Everywhere'-one of the BEST!,"After reading (and loving) 'Little Altars Everywhere', I could not wait to get my hands on this one and yet I opened it afraid that it would not live up to my high expectations! I need not have feared! The Divine Secrets was even more engaging, funnier and made me cry more! I carried it with me everywhere, even picking it up to digest a paragraph when stopped at stoplights. This was one I really COULD NOT PUT DOWN!!!!"
1,GARBAGE! Why does everyone like this book?,"Well, if you loved the movie ""Steel Magnolias,"" you'll probably like this book. Personally I thought the book was maudlin, silly, poorly- written crap. (I listened to the audio version-- did not read the actual book.) The nauseatingly cutesy names of the women put me off right from the start: Vivi, Teensy, Neecy, and Caro??? The only parts I found marginally interesting were the painful parts of Vivi's life (the convent, the drug problem, etc.). I especially hated the stupid secret ceremonies out in the woods and the long, sappy passages about the ""wonder and beauty and glory of the fabulous ya-yas."" Gag!"
4,Deeply Southern. Peculiarly Louisiana.,"The plot starts out fun and frolicking- superficial, almost. Gradually, however, you will enter the dark side that is inevitable when you are writing about women in groups. Complex, funny, well-developed and so true to those of us from Louisiana and the Deep South. My only criticism-- at times a little tooooo contrived and planned. Too much emphasis on ""brand-naming"" everything. Otherwise- a rivoting read."
2,Couldn't live up to the hype,"I was skeptical when this book was chosen by my book club for its latest selection, and I tried to be fair and objective as I began reading. I have to say, though, that my initial hunch was correct. I thought it was a tremendous disappointment. The characters, including all four Ya-Yas were very superficial...I didn't find myself invested in them at all. Characters, scenes and dialogue did not ring true...they were all very labored and clicheed (here's an original character: a gay, witty costume designer), and rendered in pedestrian prose. And am I the only reader who found Teensy's morsels (or, rather morceaux) of French dialogue akin to fingernails on a blackboard? There was no emotional payoff for me, either; Sidda's reconciliation with her mother being triggered by memories of an elephant ride just didn't work, in my mind. The seeds of a good storyteller are there somewhee, I think, but in this work, Ms. Wells couldn't pull it off."
5,I found so much of myself and my friends in this book.,"I found so much of myself in this excellent book about a group of friends raised in the South. Wells portrays so much of the humor and ironies found in traditional Southern living, that I found myself screaming out loud ""That's me! That's me!"" I shared this with my mother and grandmother, and we all highly recommend, especially if you were born and raised a ""Southern belle""."
5,"The ""Divine Secrets"" are indeed divine!","The ""Divine Secrets"" are truly dvine! The ladies in Vivi's gang remind me of all the stories I've heard about my own mother's assorted group of friends, cousins, and classmates in the 1930's. Mama and her gang weren't quite as wild and crazy as Vivi, but there was the same sense of love and support of each other.There are few really good stories about women, their relationships with one another, and with their families these days. This is a really great example of telling the woman's -- the SOUTHERN woman's --- story. I can only say, ""Long live the Ya-Ya's!"
4,Yay for the Ya-Ya's,"While I don't think Rebecca Wells will win any awards for her writing, I did find the story very intriguing. I found myself jealous that I didn't have a group of special friends like the Ya-Ya's. I had trouble putting it down because I think I was as curious as Sidda to find out more about the Ya-Ya's and their many adventures. After the ""Gone With the Wind"" scene, I dug out my video of it and popped it in the VCR. I really felt for both Sidda and Vivi and the tragic circumstances of their lives. My only criticism is that Ms. Wells kind of jumps from first person to third person and I also thought that sometimes, her ""journal entries"" and descriptions of the teen Ya-Ya's just didn't sound like a young girl narrating. I fully recommend the book, though, as enjoyable reading."
3,Another Book Written For The Hollywood Screen,This seems as if R.Wells was preparing herself for a movie deal. Alot of interesting stuff but the characters were not fully developed and felt that Viv was the only one I liked or wanted to know anything about. Alot of unresolved conflicts and the ending was too easy. How come I was more sympathetic with the drunk better than the weepy whiny 40 year old girl? Sidalee where is your sense of adventure? This was the book of the month in my book club. Certainly an easy book for discussion.
2,Read Little Alters Everywhere Instead,"I had just finished Little Alters Everywhere, which encompasses the same characters, earlier in their lives, and I picked up this book expecting a lot. Little Alters was a page-turner for me, but I had to drag myself through the first half of Ya-Ya Sisterhood before finally just giving up and putting it down. Maybe it gets really good in the last half, I don't know. I just got tired of the main character wallowing in unnecessary self-pity and neuroses over her 'traumatic' childhood. Blah blah. I put it down and started reading Wicked - the Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, and was MUCH happier."
1,"oh, puh-leeze","A trashy novel by any other name...! Completely without substance, just like the confectionery sugar they put on beignets at the Cafe du Monde. I don't understand why all the raves about this book; I found it trite and cliched."
1,Potential not realized,"I was fascinated by the psychological promise in the beginning of the book. I thought we were going to see how and why Vivi changed from the girl with so much inner spark and promise to the empty soul she became. What we got was a litany of harsh outer circumstances that could destroy some, but not others. I wanted to know why they destroyed Vivi. Or did they? The sappy and totally unbelievable ending seemed to say ""nevermind."" An unsatisfying book."
1,Good study in how to be dysfunctional Southern-style .,"Siddalee<where DO they get those names?>was a self-absorbed twit, her mother was worse and the Ya-Ya's were all rich, spoiled brats who live high at the expense of everyone around them. They're to be admired ? Puh-leeze ! The maid was far more interesting, the cosmetics selling white-trash girl had more character and the rest of them were one-dimensional bores. Waste of paper by a writer who thinks she's Anne Rivers Siddons in-training but doesn't quite have it yet. And yes, I grew up in the South."
4,"I cried, thats for sure.","This book is far from the greatest I have ever read, and I am left wondering how Rebecca Wells has been named 'Author of the Year', but it is intensly heart wrenching, and contains a divine mix of both humour and sadness. I cried frequently, as well as found myself laughing at the bizarre antics of the character's friendship, and crying at the sad deaths of interesting characters. I expected a lot less of this novel, for it is not the usual style of book I enjoy, but was plesantly surprised that it was well written and almost magical in it's style. I did however find the characters self absorbant and selfish, and later on in the novel found myself less interested in their actions. This novel, like all, has faults, but is a quick and inspiring look into friendship, Southern ways, and the relationship between daughters and their mothers."
2,Disappointing,"I'm glad I'm not alone in my assessment of this disappointingly mediocre novel. While the author has her moments, I reached the conclusion that she just isn't that great a writer. She certainly lacks something in the character-development department.I'll give it this much, though, the book held my interest. There's always something intriguing about stories that gives clues in the present to what occurred in the past. But the characters just didn't hold up. The Ya-Ya's behavior, especially as children and teenagers, was too unrealistic. Well-raised Catholic southern girls of their era didn't raise hell in public, or bath naked together as teenagers.And the character of Sidda was too exasperating for words. She couldn't marry the man of her dreams because she ""didn't know what love is"". Give me a break!! And if I read one more sentence about these woman boozing it up...It's a promising story that could have been much better in other hands. The best thing about it is it's wonderful title."
1,Left a Nasty Taste In My Mouth,"Far as I can tell this book is about a bunch of shrill, overly dramatic, self pitying alcoholics. This made for a weak book. I hated Sidda, she was irritating in her every word and action. And the mother was overdone and seemed less real for it."
3,I struggled through the beginning but I the end made up for,"I will admit I was excited about this book to due to the movie coming out and I started reading it two days ago and I struggled with the beginning the characters switching and you not know if it was the main character Sidda or Vivi(Sidda's mother). I was about to put it down when I got to ""action"" of the book and after that I enjoyed the story they writer was trying to get us to. I gave it only 3 stars because the beginning was difficult to get through but the Ya-Ya's realtionship was great and loved all their interacts in the book."
1,Ya-Ya's? More like YADA-YADA-YADA!!!,"What a major disappointment. I wanted to like this book. I yearned to like this book. I tried, and tried, and tried to like this book. However, the author never convinced me that I should care about this group of cliqueish, priveleged, self-important friends. Too forced, too trite, and too cute, the story limps along, wilting under the hot Louisiana sun. The one time that the plot began to show some intensity, some passion, Vivi is too easily rescued from the evil religious school. Poor thing, she just never fit in. The promise of a personl conflict leading to character development was never realized. The whole sequence left me empty. The author lost my attention and commitment at that point, never to regain it. The Ya-Ya's aren't devine, just disfunctional. YADA-YADA-YADA, there's a whole lot of nothing going on with this book..."
5,A spectacular read dah-lin'!,"This is a book about the bonds that can tie imperfect people together and make them stronger. Vivid description and at times very funny but also very touching- especially if you've lived in the South-- or have a mother! The characters and their adventures are memorable; it's one of those books you read over and over. Far superior to ""Little Altars Everywhere"", the book this is a sequel to. Rebecca Wells obviously matured as a writer after writing Little Altars, which does not have to be read to understand this book (in fact I would say don't read it at all, just enjoy Divine Secrets). Divine Secrets is bound to be a favorite book passed from mother to daughter-- or in my case daughter to mother! Enjoy!"
4,A tribute to southern sisters,"If you are a southern woman, or know one, you'll enjoy this book. The characters and situations seemed so real to me that I wondered if it was based on reality--if the author had actually found the ""Divine Secrets"" scrapbook assembled by the ya-ya's, and researched it's beginnings. I loved the way their story was slowly revealed, developing characters who were very real, with histories that forged the choices they made. This is a very entertaining book....you'll laugh...you'll cry."
5,Wonderful Read,"I'll forego the book description, as I see that has previously been done, but suffice to say that ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-YA Sisterhood"" by Rebecca Wells is a book that will hold the reader's attention - one you can identify with, especially if you are a woman, and one that delves into the diverse relationships between women as well as mother/daughter. Can't wait to see the movie!"
3,Touching,"Pretty good book. Fun language, interesting characters, lots of warm comfy ambiance, good story. When Wells delves into armchair philosophy it gets a little trite and schmaltzy, but overall worth a read."
4,Women Friendships are Great,Highly recommend for the woman in each of us who longs for a tight knit circle of friends. I left the book with an overwhelming feeling of warmth and wished I could have been the fifth YaYa in the group!
5,Wonderful,"""Sidda is a girl again in the hot heart of Louisiana, the bayou world of Catholic saints and voodoo queens."" So begins the entertaining adventure of the Ya-Yas, the unpredictable relationship between a mother and a daughter, and the discovery of a scrapbook that tells the story of four lives. Poignant, amusing, and thoroughly engrossing, the story of the Ya-Yas had me turning pages nonstop until ""all that was left was love and wonder."""
5,"""Ya-Ya's"" is a Great Read","A friend recommended this book, because she knew I enjoy Southern Fiction. I did not recognize the author, so I did not expect the book to be any good. I was WRONG! This is Southern Literature at it's best. I didn't read the book, I lived through it. It brought me through the best and worst of the South. It reminded me of home. This book is a must read for any Southern girl. I also recommend ""Little Altars Everywhere"", but it isn't as good."
1,Feel free to throw this one away,"What a boring read, I couldn't even finsh this one. The writing was selfserving, sappy, and unbelievably cliche. What a bunch of fluff. I couldn't relate to any of these characters, especially the pathetic narrator. I can't believe Tom Robbins(he is one of my favorite authors)recommended this book."
3,It was OKAY,"I read Ya-Ya when it first came out and I must say that I wasn't all that impressed. To me it was contrived and a very typical story about relationships between women. Aslo- it was almost like Ms. Wells was telling the reader when to cry and when to laugh (not that I actually did either). What I mean is that it was like the author was saying was ""Okay- here comes a sad part now get out your hanky"". Another thing I didn't like about the book was that you could practically figure out the entire story by the 3rd chapter! There was way too much foreshadowing and too many hints to impending doom and sad events.Basically- I read the book in one sitting on the beach oneday and haven't really thought about it since. Rebecca Wells definitly had a great idea for a story- but what came out was more like a soap opera. I didn't hate the book- but I can think of many more books with similar themes that are definitly much better. Happy Reading!"
5,"A ""Must-Read"" for all Southern Women","This book is such a therapeutic, refreshing analysis of the dysfunctional family relationships, which often go hand-in-hand with living with alcoholics in the ""Bible Belt"", and the fulfilling and truer-than-blue friendships that help put them into perspective. This book will leave you laughing 'til you're crying and crying 'til you're laughing. Thank the Good Lord and Baby Jesus for Rebecca Wells!"
5,This book IS all women of the South,"Wells has captured the essence of women of the South, especially Louisiana. Coming form Louisiana, I recognized the special way of life that we have down here immediately...I love how when Sidda and Connor are coming home at the end of the novel and Sidda asks him if he had his shots and passport. I laughed so hard because Louisiana is a different country. The book touched my soul, especially the religious side of it. When Vivi was praying to God, barganing with him, I laughed because I thought of all the times that I tried to bargain with God, as if he is some blacjack dealer. I reccomend this book to anyone and everyone, especially if you are a Yankee....Now I don't want to give anything away, but you will definately be a different woman when you finish with this book. Oh yeah, have a box of tissues ready!"
2,Poor,"The Triumph and the Glory or The Pilot's Wife leave this one in the dust. I kept hoping for Ya-Ya to express something faintly interesting and it never did. Not once. I was very disappointed. When there are so many fascinating books to read like the ones I mentioned, or classics like Terms of Endearment or the Patricia Cornwell books, why waste one's time with a half-baked book like Ya Ya Sisterhood ?"
3,"Fluffy, escapist stuff","I was encouraged to read this book by my mother-in-law -- a former drunken and neglectful mother herself. I expect she found solace in the lenient portrayal of Vivi (the protag's mother). I found it pat and over-generous, but enjoyed the author's easy, escapist style. Good summer fare, I suppose, but if you've had any meaningful encounters with characters as self-centered and destructive as Vivi, you may find it offensive, or at least oversimiplified."
4,"Would Get Five Stars, If Not For Sidda","I, like others, just could not find a liking for Sidda in this book, but devoured every minute of the Ya-Yas with relish. I then read Little Altars Everywhere, which gave so much more insight into the Walker family. What I find hard to believe is that the Sidda we met in Little Altars grew up to be that whiny, wimpy characature of a character who took us through the Divine Secrets."
1,Didn't like it,"My mom liked this book & recommended it to me. I couldn't stand it. It was just too, too....oh, I don't know.... self-congratulatory, unbelievable, or something. ""Look at what a cute little book I wrote about a bunch of women with cute little Ya-Ya names"". Maybe because I'm not from the South but it seemed like the author was trying way too hard to be oh-so-clever. Didn't work for me - made me cringe. But as you can see other people liked it. Or maybe that means it was a good book because it DID invoke feelings in me (even though they were hateful feelings). No criticism of the author as a writer - I just didn't like the characters & story - a matter of preference."
1,"Overblown, Overwritten, Overperfumed","I was disappointed. This book was sloppily written. For example on page 45 Wells writes ""It was midway into cocktail hour in the state of Louisiana when the portable phone rang at Pecan Grove."" On page 47 she writes, ""How could she have forgotten it was cocktail time in Louisiana?""On page 66 Teensy says she will gule a pair of her mother's false eyelashes onto the statue of the blessed virgin. In 1937? In rural Louisiana? I don't THINK so.There's too many errors to cite here."
3,A fun read!,"This book was very enjoyable, and these women were truly entertaining! It was so interesting to hear of their backgrounds, life stories, and by the end you truly loved each of these women. They are so fun, lively, and are women who stand up for themselves and can make a good time out of everything! It brings readers back to their childhood, and allows them to remember their childhood pals and memories."
3,Sticks Like Gumbo,"This story starts off very slow; it was hard for me to get into it for the first few chapters. Once the flashbacks started about Vivi and her Ya-Ya sisters, it got better. In fact, the adventures of the Ya-Yas were more interesting than Sidda's story, which was the frame of the book. The only male characters given a lot of attention are an old boyfriend of Vivi's, Vivi's dad, and Sidda's fiancee. However, this is a woman's story, not only about a mother-daughter relationship, but some heartaches that women experience and men don't."
4,"Wild, frustrating, wonderful daughter/mother relationshipip.","From page one the reader is caught up in the estranged relationship of Vivi and her daughter. We learn of the incredible 50 year relationships of 4 women in the Ya-Ya Sisterhood in Louisiana, who would stop at nothing to protect one another from anyone or anything. Beautifully written - one of those books where you stop reading so that you never have to face the last page. One hopes that these women's lives and adventures would go on forever!"
5,awesome....... what else can I say???,"I finished this book in 36 hours....(I just happened to be looking at the clock when I began and finished this book)... That is pretty impressive for a 14 year old. I have never been so enraptured by a book to the exstent where I completely lost track of time. This is the best book I have ever read and I will probably read it over and over again. I am not from the South but nevertheless, I felt as thought I had spent my entire existance in central Louisiana. The book is elegantly written, and even for someone who does not know French at all, I could sense the ambiance which these Frech phrases provoked. I can not compare Rebacca Wells with any other author I have read because what she wrote is unparralled and readable for almost every age. Thank You Rebacca Wells!!"
5,"A great ""Womans"" book for anyone growing up in dysfunction!","This book effected me deeply. I identified with Sidda being a adult child of an alchaholic mother, and I Identifed with her mother Vivi, being a mother of 3 little ones. Rebecca Wells hits on feelings and thoughts we all have but are to ashamed to discuss. I have a group of my own Ya ya's, and have bought them each this book! Excellant job for her second time out! A must read for this summer's sun worshipers!!!"
5,"Amen, sisters!","Finally another great book about women! I cried and laughed and cried and laughed all the way through!. A ferocious look at how Motherhood can be the most challenging, demanding and oneself annihilating job on earth and how NOTHING prepares a young girl for it.....I agree with Vivi when she wonders why they never show the Virgin Mary changing diapers but always smiling angelically!....a wonderful intrusion in the world of women's friendship and its importance to keep one's sanity. I am sure every Mrs. Proper has a ""ya-ya"" story to tell, so ""a bas les masques"" and make us laugh!!"
5,Kudos to the Ya Yas,"Living far from my birthgrounds of the Mississippi River area I was charmed by Ms. Wells accurate betrayal of life in the south. The richness of female friendships, my mothers--my own, is beautifully woven into a tale of great sadness and great joy. Yes, you will cry and you will laugh deep belly fulls and when you come up for air you should help create some little ya yas be it your little girl--granddaughter--neighbors kids,etc. and may the magic of friendship live on and on. And Rebecca, thanks, for the memories....."
3,Pick this over Little Altars,"I could be wrong, but I wonder if Little Altars Everywhere was once a part of this book. Little Altars and Divine Secrets seem to be the same story. Divine Secrets is not a collection of monologue essays like Little Altars, but a complete story. Wells does a great job with the mom character. You can't help but pity her, even love her, despite her abuse and pushiness. This book finally does something with all the characters created in Little Altars."
4,For the woman at heart,"This book is a great story about female friendship and motherly love and the possible problems that may arise in both. I have a very strong relationship with my mother and few female friends, which is mostly the opposite setting of the main character of this book. Regardless, I found myself relating to many of the characters and living their lives. It is a very touching book filled with a wide range of emotions - it made me cry, a rare occasion for me while reading books. I recommend this to anyone interested in getting in touch with her feminine side. It'll make you appreciate all the women in your lives that much more."
5,Brilliant,This book reminded me of the great relationship of girlfriends and how fun it all is. It also hit home on how grown women must be responsible for their adult lives and not blame their parents for life's curve balls. Very fun to read.
3,Funniest part,I was on an airplane reading the part about the Shirley Temple look-a-like contest. I was crying I was laughing so hard. Good book. Should I read Little Alters Everywhre?
4,A pleasure to read and pass on.,"This book has become a shortcut language for my mother, my aunts, and my friends. The joy of the sisterhood is not so much in the time spent reading alone (although that's not bad, either), but in sitting around a kitchen table laughing about Pooty Pootwell and round-robin child rearing. I did not love The Divine Secrets because it is great literature. I loved it because it is great conversation."
4,A lot of fun,"I enjoyed the Ya Ya sisterhood books because they're funny and they capture an essence of Southern life that's been lost over the years. But, I didn't like the Ya-Yas. I guess Sidda reminded me too much of myself, wanting her mother's love and devotion, but still having the scars of her mother's own selfishness. I think this is still a deeply emotional, well-mapped story, which made it worth reading for me. Rebecca Wells is quite the southern story teller."
2,a total lack of subtlety,"I loved the cover of The Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya Sisterhood. The text of the novel, however, was insulting to one's intelligence. Wells consistently feels a need to explain her character's witticisms and code words thus giving potentially humorous conversations all the levi of having a joke explained (e.g. we could have all figured out that ""the Betty"" is the yaya term fo the Betty Ford Center). Furthermore, the author often uses brand names of attire to develop hercharacters--please, portray your fictional creations with more finesse! Having just read Robert Penn Warren's All the Kings Men, I am sorry to see such a marked decline in the genre of southern fiction. Carson McCullers, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and the other greatsouthern writers would be appalled, I think, by this novel which is devoid of the evocative and subtle prose which made their work so timeless and so stirring."
3,Sure to be a favorite of lovers of kooky southern women,"Oh, no, not another book about the oddities, frailties, strengths and pathologies of southern women done with great good humor and resolution! It must be the heat.Passages about the ya-yas were the most interesting, however, the author really didn't do her job. This was supposed to be about a mother AND daughter. The daughter was just the vehicle for telling the mother's story. No real understanding of how daughter came to be who she is happened (unless of course we write off all their quirks to the heat and the R.C. church!) Read something good, or take this to the beach"
1,No connection to my life.,"This book was a disappointment because so many of the women that I share and swap books with recommended it to me and it fell flat. I guess because I did not grow up with an abusive, alcoholic mother and live-in help, I could not identify it."
5,One of the best books every written about women in conflict.,"This well written book sucks you in the very beginning. Characters are real and identifiable and you will find yourself slowing down towards the end only to prolong such a satisfying read. If I could give it 10 stars, I most definitely would."
3,The Ya-Ya's are a scream but Sidda's own story is weak.,"I am much more interested in the dynamics and pasts of the Ya-Ya's than in Siddalee's story. I find her lack of ability to love Conor fully and completely kind of boring. The conflict with the mother isn't that gripping, either. Don't expect an emotional rush, and you won't be disappointed. It's a decent beach book."
1,Maybe People Don't Know Good Literature from Bad,"Wake up, America! Just because this book has a catchy cover and title doesn't mean it's worth reading. The writing is truly awful, with just a hint of what could have been thrown in. Maybe the first page was well written, but that must have been the one the author spent the most time on. And the ending! How long does it take an author to wrap things up? In Wells' case, far too long. Perhaps a better editor would have helped. For fine southern fiction, I suggest Flannery O'Connor, for starters. There are good books out there (book clubs, are you listening?) but this isn't one of them. When I was done I kicked myself for the few days I couldn't get back... And so many great books in the world..."
1,Highly overrated trash masquerading as literature,"I was greatly disappointed when I read this much-recommended novel. I found the writing to be awkward, childish, and repetitious. Few of the characters were believable, and none of them were likeable. I found it hard to believe that this kind of drivel had received so much attention."
2,Run away,"This is one of the few books that I haven't finished. I couldn't go beyond page 90 because I found it extremely dull and annoying by the superficiality of the lives of the characters. The insipid characters weren't making me care about them or the story line. Or wait, there wasn't a plot up to where I left it. Just remembering the past full of too ideal childhood memories of the ya-yas and the daughter Sidda sugar coating the neglect of the ya-yas towards the petit ya-yas. Perhaps I just couldn't get into the lives of women who just seem bent on having fun and doing absolutely nothing worthwhile with their lives. I wish I didn't sound so harsh but I have to vent when I pick up a book expecting it to be good and couldn't even finish it. I don't like leaving books unread. I have given it one more star than I wanted to because it could have gotten better if I had given it more of a chance."
3,Oh well,a southern women having a breakdown. what's new with that. All my life i was told that southern women keep everything bottled up inside themselves until they snapped. It just took this book longer to figure that out.
3,Not for amateurs,"I was not able to use this book at all. There was one trail that was stated in the book as one of the most popular trails in the park. Not only was I unable to navigate to this trail using its map, several park rangers knew nothing about the trail either. If this is your first time in the park good luck using this book."
5,great value,This battery performs much better than I expected. So far (after 2 weeks) it is just as good as the original LG battery. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of these again should I need another cell phone replacement battery.
2,Poor Quality,"This battery is no better than my old OEM battery it replaced. It lasts approximately a day and a half on standby with almost no talking. Once it gets down to about 1/2 charge, the charge will suddenly drop off and die. Do not recommend."
1,Cell phone battery,This battery is the biggest piece of electronic junk I have ever seen. The charge does not last more than a day without being used and lasts approximately 15 minutes while in use. To be on the safe side do not purchase this hunk of junk. It's not worth your money and time.
1,Unhappy with Amazon for selling defective unit!!!!!!!,"I purchased this from Amazon, arrived, used it for 1 week until the water hose came off due the heat. I wasn't very happy with the water going all over the counter and into the drawers. I called the 800 numbers, told them of the problems, they said to cut the plug with the I.D. tag, with a check for $7 and change. They sent a new one that I have been using for 3-4 weeks now and it has not broken YET!!!??? I could have purchased at the store for less than the original price plus the $7!"
1,Disappointed in WV,"This was the first thing my son went for on Christmas morning and like many others I have been reading, it ran for almost 2 hours and then just quit. I thought it was the batteries so we changed them and still nothing. My 4 year old is very disappointed and I am too!! I was ready to jump in and buy him another one from somewhere else until I read your reviews. Thanks so much for sharing your story's. How does a 4 year old understand that Santa Clause brought him a piece of junk!"
1,I managed to fix it...,"Our set worked for a total of 30 seconds on Christmas morning. Luckily, we had a plane to catch so my son couldn't dwell on it.I followed the advice of another reviewer here and glued a couple of the internal parts together (their review describes the process accurately). So far it's holding up fine. Mattel offered a voucher to purchase another Mattel product, but they couldn't guarantee when this set would be available again. My son said he wanted his Piston Cup track even though the motor wasn't working.Now it's working and he has the best of both worlds, but I'm very disappointed that Mattel would put out something so badly designed that it breaks in less than a minute. The fix was relatively easy, but be careful with the little washers that go on the gear posts...take the back off very slowly to see where they go."
1,Booster Quit,"I, like many others, bought this for my son for Christmas and imagine our disappointment when after putting it completely together we found out the booster wouldn't work. We tried multiple batteries and found it wasn't that. Appears to be a defect since many others had the same problem."
1,Skip this one,"This toy is not what we expected. The track does not stay together well, hard to click the track together, cars jump off the track easily, and it is VERY noisy.I would also avoid the radio controlled CARS race track sold in Disney Stores. Track takes a while to put together and the cars leap off the track due to high speeds. Battery life is short and the cars are hard to drive using the remotes. Radio signals often cross over or simply don't work. At $[...] + I wish I had not bought it."
1,poor,"""bug off"" is a deceiving title for a comforter that doesn't actually repel bugs. Instead, it only has pictures of bugs on it. I purchased it, and now have to return it because I thought it would repel bugs for camp."
2,Not ready for prime time,"After reading the reviews on this website I purchased Resume Maker 7.0 and installed the program on a Windows2K computer. The installation of the program is the only thing that has not given me problems. Though the program has many excellant features, getting them to work properly has been an exercise in patience. Even after getting the upgrades to V7.3 the program still constantly crashes or changes the spacing/formatting of the document I am working on. Text is dropped out of description cards with out me knowing it, spaces and/or lines are inserted at the end of description cards for no reason, and I could go on. This software has the potential to be a great program, but in my opinion it is not quite ready for prime time."
3,Pretty good,this book was good but alot of the info found in this book could be found online for free. This book comes with forms you can use to break down everything you need to do which are very useful though.
3,"Decent guide, but not the best...not even for Psych students","This is one of the better books on getting into grad school, but its not the best. For the most part, it talks about things that most students will have figured out themselves by their senior year. There are a few extra tidbits, though, so I'd recommend buying it along with the book by Mumby. There are some similarities between the two books, but Mumby's book will tell you about some things that would never occur to you. In my case, the extra insights are what made the difference when I was applying to grad school (I got into a Psychology MA program). I don't advise wasting your money on most of the other books."
3,A good introduction,"Keppie's work regarding the development of the Roman Army from the republic to the early principate does a good job of describing some of the aspects of the Roman Army: marching camp, weapons and organisation. Lacking any meaningful battle descriptions, and with somewhat long appendix section on mostly irrelevent material, nevertheless is a good introductory book for the beginner."
5,Cute but cheaper elsewhere,"These are cute, I just bought some for my 2 & 4 yr old daughters, they love to change their clothes. Definetly durable but you can pick these up off the Fisher price website for $12 and $6 for the extra outfits."
2,It works but then both stopper faucets broke :(,"Initially it was good at preserving red wine for 5-7 days, but then one stopper faucet broke, and then the second. The stop for the stopper in a thin piece of plastic. When I contacted the company they said it is not a warranty issue because it is usually due to over tightening. Well I tightened it the same every time, it just seems the plastic stop gets brittle with age and then breaks AND falls into the bottle of wine. They want $18 per for repair of each stopper and return shipment, which is not bad, but if it happens again and again? Asked if the stopper has been modified to make it more durable, and waiting for a response before deciding what to do. Will get back when I hear from them."
2,What happened to Fred when he quit dancing with Ginger?,"No wonder Fred quit making after a few like this one. I love Fred, but this is not worth re-watching. Bring back Ginger."
3,"""The Sky's the Limit""",Fred Astaire fans have been waiting for a DVD release of this film for some time now. There are some quality issues - the VCR issued under the RKO labeling remains the best until a better issue may be found.
5,For W&G Fanatics!,"This book is great for people who are obsessed with the show. The colorful (and I mean COLORFUL) pages are filled with photos, episode summaries (seasons 1 -6), cast and character bios (on minor characters as well), witty quotes and a lot of behind the scenes articles and tidbits. It makes a great coffee table book to pick up and flip through and relive the laughter."
5,"Not Kitano's usual, but it's worth it.","This is not what most Takeshi Kitano fans expect from him. If you view this with no pre-conceptions of his previous style of films, you will see that this is a piece of art."
5,Outstanding Cirque du Soleil selection!!!,"One of the better Cirque du Soleil performances. If you like their stuff, I'd adsvise buying it. And the Blu-Ray version is visually amazing. I don't have the whole 5.1 or 7.1 setup...so I can't really comment on that. But all the Blu-Rays I've watched do sound a lot crisper and clearer even with just my TV speakers!"

3,Update Needed,This sounds like a wonderful resource. Published in 1996 the readings are most likely not from the Revised Common Lectionary which means users will have to adapt the materials on Sundays when they do not match what is being read within the congregation. Perhaps a revised version is forthcoming? It could also be argued that the changes within the RCL lectionary are not so numerous that a new edition would be worth the work. Perhaps someone who already owns the work will correct me if my assumption about the book not tracking with the RCL is in error.
4,good,"I'm really enjoying the reading, it has given new insight into the psychological portion of my girls."
3,Two time award winning books,"I find this author's books to be inspiring, mind warming, breather taking, but I think that Makes Me Wanna Holler was a better book for me. I don't know if I'm am the only one who thinks this. Now, if I had to pick a favorite chapter, I would have to say ""Gangsters, Gun, and Shoot-`Em-Ups"" was the best. One thing I like about this chapter was the whole gangster mentality. Also I like this chapter because I like the movie ""The God Father"" just like Nathan and his friends in the book."
2,C- From a white guy,"McCall has a lot of perspective on racial issues. So much perspective, in fact that he understands how both whites AND blacks view each other. Whites think blacks are stupid, whites don't want to live around blacks (integration is just a pretense for giving blacks the boot)You'll get the basic idea after a couple chapters. There's no need to think for yourself when you've got someone as brilliant as McCall telling you how you think."
5,Life in Istanbul during the last years of the Ottoman Empire,"This book that was written by an American (Mrs. Frances Kazan) gives a very accurate picture of the daily life in Istanbul during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. While I was studying history at the Turkish public schools where I was born and raised, I often wondered how the daily life of the people in Turkey was during those difficult years. This book gives an account of the daily life from a Turkish woman's point of view - A Turkish Woman who was trained in a western school.I disagree with Mr. Dimostenes Yagcioglu's comments that the author's knowledge of the Turkish Culture and language being superficial. The Harem life, the coffee houses at Pera, dinner at Tokatliyan, and the lokums of Haci Bekir etc. were all described correctly."
3,Not For Me...,"Too cute, too annoying, and too similar to the UNDEAD series by MaryJanice Davidson. If you like cute, fluffy vampire reads with vain, self-centered heroines then you'll undoubtedly love this book. I won't be reading any others in the series myself."
2,Bland,"I found this story so-so. The characters and plot were bland. Lil, the main character, is very materialistic to the point of nausea. I really wanted this to be a good book but all that I cared was pushing myself to the end. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters as long as the book was over. Sorry."
3,This bites,"I was definitely a cute vampire romance, but there are better ones out there that really got my attention and had more going for them.Needless to say, I had high hopes for this book since the description was so good.Maybe the sequel will be better?"
2,boring!,"not much excitment in this book, i have read ALOT of the vampire novels and this one just did not do it for me, the story dragged and there was not much in excitment or steamy senes that most of them have. was dissapointed in this one. I recommend the Glory st Clair series instead. That one makes you laugh out loud and enjoy the hot senes."
4,Good quality gloves,"The previous reviews were pretty accurate: these gloves do indeed fit like a second skin. The leather and handiwork are good for the price, and is no more nor less than what I expected. Shipping was incredibly quick. I received the gloves over the weekend, within three days of clicking ""order"". All in all, no problems whatsoever, and I got what i expected. Would buy from again."
3,"Good, not great","I bought these at the same time as another pair. These are good gloves - the leather material has a nice feel, provides excellent grip on a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and the gloves help keep hand oils and other contaminants off the steering wheel's leather. The only thing about these gloves I don't care for is the use of velcro on the straps."
1,Broke after two weeks,"This little drive worked great for two weeks and then, suddenly, all of my files are gone. There is no physical damage to the device and it still comes up in XP but sans any files."
5,Awesome USB Drive,"I really like this USB Drive. Works well, and comes in a very cool enclosure. It is easy to use, and never had any issues with this product."
3,Overpriced Books,"This book was pretty informative, however, I was a little disappointed paying $11 bucks for something that was very small, I don't even think that there are 100 pages. Good information in a small space but I just expected more for my money."
2,Doesn't hit the goal,"This book is insufficient and inadequate: has not enough in amount or quality to satisfy its purpose.Chapter 1, ""Levels of Support"", give fair information to a beginner about the paradigm of the levels of support, and may be helpful for an individual who applies for technical support. This chapter assists to become aware of an internal structure of the organization, which provides technical support.The rest of chapters seem to be targeted not to individuals who ask for technical support but for technical support professionals. These chapters do not reach their goal. The information is incomplete and discontenting. The author would better write a better book for technical support applicants, not professionals.I would recommend ""IT Problem Management"" by Gary Walker instead of this book."
3,Designed for a specific level.,"This book was extremely successful in reviewing subject matter for daily life. This includes travel, restaurant etiquette, personal relationships, and French literature. On the other hand, it does not give a very comprehensive review of grammar. Its presentation of the subjunctive was especially lacking due to its brevity. This book is most fit for more advanced students who have a handle on the basics, but need help in focusing on interaction with the world."
3,Should have checked reviews first!,"Just purchased this and am very happy with picture quality....we have it hooked up to basic cable outlet. BUT the audio is so bad we are going to return it. We do not want to add speakers as the purchase was for a kitchen counter and to save space. Too bad, we liked everything about this tv except the sound"
4,Beautifully descriptive - even of the outhouse!,"I'm in a small book group and was a bit wary of choosing this due to the title - I didn't want another morbid, dysfuntional story. Though this is about various dysfunctional families - it's funny. I think we could all see someone we know in many of these characters perhaps even ourselves. A quick read - you always want to find out what happens next - I love that in a book."
3,Lake Makes The Film Fun,"This is a fairly humorous story with decent special effects, especially considering it was made over 40 years ago. The key ingredient for success in this film was Veronica Lake. She's known more for her peekaboo blonde locks and for starring with Alan Ladd in several hit film noir movies, but Lake was a good comedienne, too.Susan Hayward does well playing a snotty woman and Cecil Kellaway always plays an interesting character. Frederic March plays opposite Lake and I wish I hadn't read Lake's biography in which she explains how much she hated March. In made the love scenes lose a lot of impact when I learned how ""forced"" those scenes were.Oh, well. It's still a nice, lightweight comedy, nothing special but entertaining for the most part.....but it helps to be a fan of Lake, which I am. I'm surprised this movie still isn't availabe on DVD, at least here in Region 1."
3,Picture shows two shocks,"Make sure you know that it shows two shocks but it says ""shock"" not shocks....Other than that shipping is fast,,"
5,best game,"i play this game for hours. don't open it if you don't have a lot of time to invest. you can play it without having lots of time, but then you won't experience the cool parts as much"
5,Awsome game!!!!,I love this game i mean you get to run your own bussiness and fire people and their are awsome new stuff for your sims and I would tottaly recamend this game to anyone well exept people under 13 because their not suposed to play it because its rated teen.
4,"I like the versatility of this holster, and it gets a lot use.","This is my daily holster, and use it for a Ruger LCR that sits under my left arm or ITWB on the right hip. The small is a little snug having a 32"" waist, and will get a medium if I replace it. The large Velcro patch leaves plenty of room for adjustment. For me when wearing it around the rib cage, I'm only using about 1.5"" of about 4"" of Velcro. So for me the Medium would have been a better fit. After 9-10 months of just about daily wear, I'm use to it. After the holster breaks in to your gun, it holds it very securely. Most of the time I forget it's even there. I'll typically wear from 10-14 hours a day. Sure, after 14 hours I'm ready to take it off but I'm ready for the boots to go as well."
4,Good price,It was a good price and exactly what it was described to be. The only part I don't love is that it is made out of jersey material and you can see through it when the sun is shinning however that is what was described.
3,Atmospheric and creepy ghost/possession story,"The story begins interesting enough with the young couple, Sandy and David on their way to a vacation ski house in the snowy mountain community of Owlsfane. They are to spend a relaxing week of skiing and enjoying themselves before Christmas. Upon arriving at the ski house, they are excited and can't wait to try the slopes and maybe if they're lucky they will see the famous ghost that is said to inhabit the house that is across the street from where they are staying. Sandy and David decide to break into the house at midnight and do some exploring. It doesn't go as planned and Sandy soon finds herself at odds with the forces of the house and must fight the possession that threatens her body and mind. This book is way tooooo long. Like the other reviewer said, it could stand to be trimmed about 100 pages or more. Other than the fact that it is long and sometimes silly, it is a decent read and at times very creepy!!!"
1,never was a great unit,This unit worked well enough out of the box but eventually began freezing and skipping. Unplugging and resetting the unit worked a few times but now all it does is show red-yellow and blue scrambled blotches with some excellent sound in the background. I have several Dennon products and it is a good brand but this is an expensive black brick.And trying to get service on the unit is like trying to buy a ticket on plane with the last name of Jihad..
3,Buy This Video If You Wanna Fall Asleep!,"Who came up with this video. Obviously Brit had nothing to do with this video. they showed her friends that she talks about in interviews which is kind off cool, but other than that it put me to sleep. I didnt hear britney talk once. I liked the pictures but thats about it. Wait for a video that brit makes, not some cheezy interviewer looking for big bucks!"
3,Almost open,3 1/2Calderazzo's cooking is fairly impressive on the piano player's debut. Impressive enough to provide numerous fiery lines and elevated transitions that keep things inspired (helped no doubt by fantastic sax work-Jerry Bergonzi is in the mix as well) but generic enough to keep several overall compositions predictably pretty.
3,A bit disappointed,"One of the bottles leaks, and I didn't realize it until I was soaked half way through my run. In 30 degree weather, being wet from the middle back all the way down the back of my legs is unpleasant. In every other way, though, it has been great. It doesn't slip, the storage bags are the perfect size for my IDs, keys, and gels."
1,US version is edited severely,Visually amazing but this version is severely truncated. 80 minutes? Just unacceptable for something like this.Seek out the Asian versions for the full experience -- I'm sure there is a cheap Hong Kong version of the DVD out there as well as the various higher priced Japanese DVDs.
2,Gawd Awful,"In a nutshell--don't waste your precious time. There's plenty of interesting imagery in this movie but little else. More like watching a very long video game. The film goes from super fast anime style action with editing so rapid that you can't even be sure of what you are seeing(complete with speed lines flowing from the fast moving characters) to long meaningless speeches where characters face off verbally in cavernous rooms. There are robot armies that look as though they were borrowed from the George Pal Puppetoon screwball armies. The symbol used by the one faction calling themselves ""neo-sapiens"" is a cross between a swastika and a 45 RPM record spindle adapter. The one army uses Nazi style helmets and uniforms. There's a touch of Jesus and the three wise men imagery tossed in, as well. It's a hodge podge of images combined to trigger various emotions within you but when you actually examine the story, you realize there's nothing to examine but a collection of interesting pictures."
5,great anime basem movie,"this movie has great visuals, great actors, and a terrific story. it's more of an action romance than a action film.. which is great! if you love Japanese movies than this film is just for you."
1,NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!,"Despite what the distributor's say, don't be fooled. This is NOT the director's cut of Casshern, it's a sanitized version with twenty-four minutes cut out of the film. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Stayed up all night to finish it,"I read this book in one sitting, which would've been fine if I didn't have to sleep! I've read other books by Deborah Smith, and although I liked Blue Willow, it isn't my favorite one. (So far I like 'Stone Flower Garden' and 'When Venus Fell' the most, maybe because I read them first.) There's only one reason I didn't give Blue Willow 5 stars: it was too long for me. There were great characters with lots of depth, but towards the last few chapters I felt like it was dragging and I only stayed up late to finish it because I just wanted it to finally end! All of Smith's books I've read are wonderful romantic reads, with lots of meat to them. I enjoy her books a lot, and usually don't want them to end after I've finished, but I do have to take breaks in between because they all have a common theme: star-crossed lovers who meet as children."
2,not that great...,I was disappointed. It did not turn out what I expected. I would be cautious. Perhaps listening to some samples is a good idea.
4,I liked this movie.,This movie was suspenseful and alot of W T F. Good movie for your average college student types.. This movie is not for the arrogant high society types like (the 1 to 2 star reviewers) where they expect a oscar award winning acting & SGI in a low budget film... LOL
2,"Home made movie, poor copy of Paranormal Activity...","With budget no more than $1000 (for the camera(s) cost plus the laptop) everybody can make a movie like this. Bad sound effects, bad actors, even a ""typo"" on ending text, almost identical ""scenario"" with Paranormal Activity. If you've seen Paranormal Activity and movies like it, then you don't need this at all. The only thing that you might like is the house and it's decoration, nothing more to add."
4,Pretty good!,I get that it's a knock off of Paranormal Activity - but it was still pretty good and kept my interest. I love these pretend-reality-show horror movies and this one stood up a lot better than some of the ones I've seen where a bunch of stupid college students just run around a haunted hospital for a day and then get killed.
3,Apples and Oranges,"Everyone can agree that it is a clone of Paranormal Activity but this one DOES NOT rely entirely on loud noises and dropping cookware from the ceiling. Unlike its counterpart there actually IS a plot and a plausible explanation for the events (I'm not saying its the greatest one but then again it's not the crap Activity wants you to believe either)So here it is, apples and oranges meaning both movies have their own ideas however this one is probably a more down to earth lower budget version but its certainly worth a look since most horror aficionados looking for a scare don't really care which actors are in them or the quality of their performance. Though cameras pushed at pivotal moments may be hokey, so are screams from the darkness and bodies flying at the camera."
4,"Rugged, relaxed and dressy if flipflops were dressy","This pair of flipflops looks good and is very well-made. Note that they seem a little small for their size - I wear US size 11, ordered a UK size 10 (the equivalent according to Amazon's conversion tables), and found them too small for me. (Aren't flipflops supposed to be worn oversized anyway?) So you might want to get a bigger size and avoid that pitfall.The main minus point of these is that they're heavy and not too flexible - not quite the light foam flipflops that I prefer. But they look good, so what the heck..."
3,Historical Maps Yes!,"Disappointingly few maps of anything other than the late war (most of the maps are 1943-1945). Some of the maps are in such fine detail that even with a magnifying glass it would be tough to see or read all the detail. Still this book has some wonderful treasures in it. Highlights for me are the French maps showing how little they knew of what Germany was sending against them and the one map of Bulgaria. Even though I would have liked a lot more maps on other aspects of the war, most every WWII student is likely to find at least several of the maps to be very interesting. For less than $5 this is a great reference."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!,"As a fan of Reboot I was thrilled that I might see the entire collection. Although DVD's are sold as Volumes they only contain a few episodes. Not near enough to enjoy the true richness of the series. When I purchased ALL 4 volumes some even purported to be ""seasons"" I expected to get just that. Not 4 selected epsiodes from each year. I would have GLADLY paid more to actually get what I wanted...this was only a teaser DVD..."
1,grip for 30d,does not fit snugly onto camera. Seems loose.only one locking screw top attach to the camerafeels like its going to fall off
5,If you are a singer -- you MUST get this book!,This book is well worth the money! The techniques and vocalises Ms. Alba supplies on her CD and actual lesson excerpts on the DVD are invaluable for singers and teachers alike. Truly a must have for the singer's library.
4,Small but good,"I like this style of salad spinner. When I ordered it, though, I didn't realize that it is as small as it is. It would be adequate for one person who doesn't chow down on salad all day. I recomend the product if you don't have much salad to spin."
1,Shameful packaging!,"The product is wonderful. However, over 80% of the product was destroyed as the packaging was insufficient and this most of the toasts broke. out of 10 boxes perhaps 2 were unbroken. DO NOT BUYGrille French Crisp Toast, 10.58-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)"
5,Starbucks will go out of business,"This espresso/moka pot is outrageously awesome! Here's a nice tip for those of you who have wood stoves: Get the stove up to 400, prepare the pot as prescribed in the directions (which have some funny English translations), and set on the wood stove top. I just made a pot in 12 minutes. Also, if you're a latte person like me, head over and buy the aerolatte hand held milk frother/foamer. These two items combined will put Starbucks out of business. The cost of them together is roughly the same as 15 fancy coffees from Starbucks ... this is a no brainer for cappuccino, espresso, and coffee drinkers. I currently use the Starbucks espresso blend but am going to try all kinds of things."
1,Loved it but it broke,"Why did this product lose it's handle when I tried to open it? I had it only 33 daysbefore it broke. And Amazon has offered no option for returning broken merchandise after 30days it turns out. I'm pretty upset with Amazon. I already have an smaller Bialetti so Ireally like the coffee it makes, but I think the 12 cup is just too big to perform well.[ASIN:B000FDL588 Bialetti Moka Express 12-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker]]Update: Thank you Amazon--you did refund most of the cost. I'm out only $14 for this purchase.I'll remain a customer. Dare I try the next smaller Bialetti--the 9 cup?"
3,"Makes good coffee, but Brikka is best","There is no denying that this pot makes some darn good coffee. I like it better than most drip and french press. However having tried the Brikka prior to this, it is the winner hands down. I was under the impression that the Moka Express would taste the same as Brikka just with less crema. I was wrong, the Brikka simply produces a better brew. I'm convinced it has something to do with the patented valve system, exclusive to the Brikka, which pressurizes the brew as it bubbles up into the main chamber."
4,Bialetti Moka Express,Makes excellent coffee much better than automatic drip. Just wish it came in a larger size. Very well made. Would recommend.
1,First Lemon From Bialetti (12-Cup Version),"We have 3-cup and 6-cup versions of this great coffee maker and decided it is time to move to a larger version for big dinners. We tried low, med, high heat settings. We also tried fine, medium, and coarse grinds. With no luck, the coffee maker was unable to make the steam go through the grounds and into the top of coffee maker. Really wanted to like this but perhaps we received a lemon. Beware is all."
2,Not as classic as stated,"Although ""original"" it is suprisingly cheap. I thought the product from Italy had more refinement. It is an alloy with crude edging, nicks and a poor engraving of the logo and signature. I don't dispute that it is simple to use but perhaps it would be better if made of stainless steel (and I don't mean from India)."
5,Best Cup of Coffee Ever!,"We got this just after Christmas, and it is absolutely the best cup of coffee that we have had since we were in Italy. I can't stand to drink drip coffee anymore. There are several things to keep in mind for the best results. (1) Use good filtered or spring water (2) Use a finely ground good coffee, such as Illy (3) pack it just slightly in the filter (4) Don't try to rush it by turning the heat up too high (5) NEVER put it in the dish washer.We have been using the organic espresso blend from Whole Foods, and it is almost as good as the Illy. All in all, this is easier and faster than most coffee makers and gives us a nice two servings of espresso in the morning. Add a little milk if you like, but it's also great straight out of the pot."
4,Beautiful...,"I ran across this book entirely by accident. While scanning the shelf for yet another author, the title caught my eye, and being a Russian language undergraduate and traveler; I decided to take the book home to find out more these ""russian fantasies"". When at home, I randomly opened the book and landed straight on the story Birobidzhan and decided that was were I would start and within a few lines, I was totally in love. Mr. Kalfus has a writing style that instantly transports his readers into the same realm of his characters. Not only could I envision Israel and Larissa dancing, but I could also hear that insistent jazz unwinding from its record. It's been a long time since I've been memorized by an author, albeit a male author and I must say that the story Birobidzhan is enough for me to say this book is wonderful."
1,ostarozhno!,"this is the most absurd collection of short stories i have ever encountered, and i don't mean in the danill kharms sort of way. in order for any of these stories to be believable, the author must do one of two things: either make them reasonable, or get the reader to suspend disbelief. kalfus does neither of these. he obviously has pretentions, but he winds up strictly pretentious. living in Moscow for four years obviously made him want to write the great russian novel, which is an absurd notion to begin with, and he tries so hard, too hard in fact that the product is nothing more than parody. his characters are obvious, his devices are silly, and his prose is choppy. if you want to read something about russia, do not look here (it might not be a bad idea to get a russian author, or at least a non-russian author who actually understands russian culture, language, tradition, etc.). about the only thing russian about his characters are their names. this is just plain bad."
4,I Think I'm Right,"I don't actually own this package of music but I have heard it. If it's the original tunes. I remember the serious sounding (though actually comical) ""The Bird is the Word"" (whichever tune that is here) in a cheapie sci-fi flick called, ""The Crawling Hand"" (a detached hand strangles people). I remember the Trashmen doing effective cover(s) in the early- to mid-1960s of some of the Rivingtons music. I remember the Rivingtons at a concert in Arizona as recently as the early 90s. I know that there are some people who consider the Rivingtons as essential in the history of ""rock"" (?). I'm willing to give them their due. But I don't think an extended package of their work (which I assume is why it's so pricey) is warranted. I don't know now why that ""Bird is the Word"" thing was sung so seriously like a deep-in-love tune. Oh, well."
3,"Quality seems great, but too small...","I bought this to remove tie rod ends on my '06 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but it's too small to fit on the tie rod ends or either ball joint. Might work better on a smaller vehicle. The description tells you the spread but nothing else so it was hard to judge whether or not they would work, got my answer though.."
3,My opinion,Product took almost a week to arrive. Box was extremely beaten up on arrival and someone had added tape to it to secure the paper.I wasn't impressed..
1,What were they thinking?,"Who knew you had to read reviews for paper? I was quite surprised when I opened the box to find that the paper was stacked higher than the box bottom leaving all of the top sheets to become crushed. The bottom sheets also must be removed carefully so as not to wrinkle the sides as you use up the paper because the bottom is too big also. They really should title this ""first draft"" paper or something like that. No one wants to receive crumpled up letters. Even worse, this was only a $1 or $2 cheaper than 5 reams at my paper store. Shame on you HP."
5,"Great paper, great price",If you do a lot of printing then you'll appreciate the bulk quantity of paper at a decent price. I was happy with my purchase.
3,HP Office Quickpack Paper,Paper is good quality for general use. Poor packaging. Box arrived damaged and about 200 sheets of paper were wrinkled and could not be used in printer.
2,Meh...,"Thought this was the last book and I bought it, terribly excited and surprised at the lack of hype. It's actually just a diary, so if you have a child interested in the series, it's definitely something they'd enjoy. Otherwise...meh (shrugs shoulders)."
2,someone's high school term paper?,"Not worth the money! It is 106 pages, large type-face, with lots of pages taken up with chapter titles, sayings, quotes. If the extraneous stuff was removed and the type-face was at a normal size, this would be a 30 page pamphlet. It reads like someone took most things from other people's term papers. Very superficial."
2,A true Skeptic's Review of a weak argument,"I bought this book after meeting Tarpley in person and being completely intrigued by him. Let me say this first: I'm very much leaning towards believing that 911 was an inside job, but Tarpley's book, from a purely intellectual level, leaves a lot to be hoped for. His book is riddled with non-sequitors and false analogies. Don't get me wrong, I'm on his side. But not with a weak minded argument like the (might I add) cheap looking book he has here."
1,Communist writing at its best,"If you decide to waste your money on this tripe, you will enjoy Webster Tarpley's thoroughly communist version of history."
1,Spanish version is better,My daughter was not interested in the english version. The spanish version is not only teaching her spanish but I am learning as well :)
2,neem oil,"works great on dogs, the patch of hair is growing back on my keeshound but it smells horrible and it's tough to get them to eat it."
4,An enjoyable history of Fermat's theorem.,"This book engrossed me so much that I couldn't put it down. As a non-mathematician, I enjoyed the history of Fermat's Theorem more than the accounting of the actual proof. This is a keeper."
2,The still untold story of the Fermat's Last Theorem,"The author missed a real opportunity to introduce the complex world of mathematics to the general public. Using the mechanism of reviewing how this riddle was finally solved, the author could have provided an interesting lesson in mathematics and a history of its greatest contributors. However, what is presented in ""Fermat's Last Theorem : Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem"" is little more than an outline, and it left this reader wanting for a whole lot more. Not only is the technical treatment overly simple, but the personalities involved are shallow to the point that no interest is generated. In reality the author fails to unlock any secrets. I recommend future readers wait until the movie comes out"
3,A quick read mathematical history of Fermat's Last Theorem,"I had this book sitting around the house for more than a year before picking it up yesterday. Once started, I could hardly put it down and finished it today. This is an entertaining read for the person more interested in mathematical history than a true mathematician (but what mathematician reads or writes about the history of mathematics anyway?) I might challenge one or two historical references, but the anecdotes about ancient mathematicians represent the true charm of this book. A quick, easy, enjoyable read."
4,An Introductory Book,"While I did enjoy this book, I believe that it only serves as an introductory preface to the theorem. It does present all of the main ideas, but it fails to provide a network with which to tie them all together. When used with another book, such as Fermats Enigma by Simon Singh, many of the ideas come together so that the reader can see where Andrew Wiles proof came from and how it works. I would recommend this book for those who have very little knowledge of the theorem and would like to know a general outline."
4,"A very enjoyable, light read for amateur mathematicians.","I very much enjoyed the way that the author brought details of the history of mathematics into the story of the final proving of Fermat's Last Theorem. I enjoyed the intrigue and the suspense. I especially enjoyed the little tidbits, such as the story of happenings when the Pythagoreans discovered irrational numbers. If my teachers back in junior high school had shared such interesting sidelights of history, I am sure that I would have come to appreciate math at a much earlier age. I bought copies of this book as Christmas presents for those of my friends who enjoy trivia of the world of mathematics."
4,Brandeis: Champion of the individual in his or her natural context,"This is the classic biography of Justice Brandeis, who despite his elite social setting, never lost touch with the fundamental human need for justice that begins with the protection of individual rights as found in a human scale of meaningful life. This meant that the overall human enterprise must respect and sustain life at its face to face level in every walk of life, and that we jeopardize our collective well-being in our being seduced by institutions that in their enlargement reduce us to anonymous membership in the herd. Despite questions about his, at times, contradictory judicial methods, and his quirky admiration for time studies in industry, his intentions remained true and consistent and need to be reexamined in this age of freedom crushing institutional scale."
1,Bad quality - don't make the mistake of purchasing,"The brass work and glass tube are nice enough, but the thermometer is cheap and inaccurate. After separating several times, it failed completely less than 2 years after purchase."
4,Looks great!,Bought this as a gift for someone and the style is great! It has a very antique feel to it that will adds nice touch to a brick house with a lush garden.
2,Criterion premium,"""Fiend"" was one of my favorite movies as a kid though I can now see that it is mostly boring, but with a pretty big payoff (for back then) of muck oozing brain monsters at the end.I am writing this though as a complaint about Criterion securing the rights to films and then jacking up the price to $35. Given that other studios are producing DVD prints just as clean as Criterion is and charging - at most - $19, I can never bring myself to pay Criterion prices. All the more unfortunate for me as they have a # of titles that I would like to own.To the reviewer that said ""no one does it like Criterion"", quality-wise, that is flat out wrong, price-wise, entirely true.And a price tag of $35 on a movie like ""Fiend"" is truly absurd."
4,It's paper - what do you expect? :),"You'd think the US would be up with the play on international standards and that you'd be able to find A4 paper reasonably easily. Not so. But still, with lots of horribly over-priced options out there, this one was only mildly silly on price (I could have imported it for the same price, but it would have taken a lot longer) and it arrived very quickly."
3,"It's available, but not great","It is very difficult to obtain A4 paper, and this is about the only I found. but the quality is poor and the paper is very thin. It jams the printer and makes it take in multiple pages. What should have been a simple printing job took forever, but if you're the only choice....."
5,A4 FTW!,"Wait, Amazon sells A4 paper at a reasonable price?! Epic win!This paper is nice quality 96 bright, similar to US Letter paper you'd get for a similar price and considerably nicer than the $3-4 bargain stuff. Considering how hard it is to find A4 in the US, this paper is a steal if you have any use for A4, or even just to annoy people by having documents that don't fit in the stack.The other reviewer who mentioned the extortionate prices others get for A4 is right--I understand paying a couple dollars more because it's non-standard, but most places that sell A4 in the US charge a fortune for it. Thanks, Amazon!"
1,WAITING FOR A BOX SET,"Who would want the first episode but not the entireseason? Other studios have figured out that TV showsshould be released in season box sets. Come on Universal,get your act together! I would be first in line for seasonbox sets of any of the Law & Order series, but will not buythis release. I hope other fans will send Universal Studiosa message buy not buying it and letting them know why."
4,always great,"always great, always great, always great, always great, always great, always great....isn't that enough said already? always great....what else do you need to know?????"
5,BEST FAMILY FILM YET,"This is a wonderful film for the entire family. A well told tale of Mark Twain's beloved book. It has all the big sets that only MGM could do, and the costumes set the perfect tune for this family epic.Two young boys gorwing up along the Missippissi River in the days of riverboats and minstrels. Young viewers will be entranced as they watch Tom and Huck Finn ponder what to do next after they wittness the murder of the town's doctor at the graveyard.This is a film that will be watched again and again. FIVE STARS !"
2,Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer DVD ~ Fred Stack,I do not recommend this movie. Of all the non-animated Tom Sawyer movies that I've seen this one's the worst. (The 1938 movie was the best.) The acting (both visual & audio) should have been better. I was disapointed with some of what was left out of the story -even though this is quite a legnthy movie. Some of the background music sounds Europian. And now the clincher: I suspect that this movie was dubbed into English from Russian from the 1981 Soviet Union TV movie: Priklyucheniya Toma Sojera i Geklberri Finna. The names of the director & lead actor were also translated. Stanislav Govorukhin became Stan Govorkin. FYODOR STUKOV became FRED STACK. Is this really so. If it is then I feel that it is dishonest not to disclose this movie's origin.
2,Mark Twains Tom Sawyer,Unsatisfactory production. Dialog was not performed well and was poorly dubbed. The story remains excellent but was produced badly.
1,Rolling Lawn Aerator,This product is as worthless as teats on a boar hog. It will not do the job it's advertised to do. Keep your money and use it for a steak dinner.Rolling Lawn Aerator
2,Core Aeration Is Better Than Spike Aeration,"I have not used this product, but spike aerators do not do what a lawn requires. Core aeration is a far superior method of aerating. Hire a local lawn maintenance company to do the job for you, or rent the machine and do it yourself."
4,A Little Surprised,"We were a little surprised that it came with no handle. Once we located a handle, it was wonderful to use."
3,Needs weight,"This product is ok, It will not work unless the ground is wet & soft. All it needs is a little more weight so it can penatrate into the ground."
1,NO WAY TO AERATE!,"THIS AERATOR MIGHT BE VERY EFFECTIVE, IF, & WHEN I AM ABLE TO ASSEMBLE IT. THE DESIGN REQUIRES THE INSERTION OF6 BARS WHICH MUST BE INSERTED INTO BOTH WHEELS ALL AT THE SAME TIME. THIS EFFORT COULD BRING A GROWN MAN TO HISKNEES."
1,Crashed after 14 months,"Just two months after the warranty expired this thing died. Thank goodness it was only for backup, but I won't waste money with this company again."
1,"Drive used a couple dozen times, now dead","I can't believe this thing died on me already. My first dead drive since the '90s. OK, so it's over a year old. But I've only used it maybe once a month. It sat on my desk in all that time, no moving, no bumping, no jarring, just nice and comfy. I kept the maintenance records for all my cars on there. Everything, going back 10 years, and I'm a real car nut with 5 vehicles and $$$thousands spent just on parts. Now that history is all gone...gas fill-ups, odometer readings, fluid changes, repairs, expense records, etc.Read the reviews. Lots of dead examples out there. Stay away from Fantom. I know I will."
1,Pathetic product,"Hi,As rightly mentioned by many people in their reviews, this hunk of junk dies after few uses!Its perhaps due to low quality external casing!The one that I received have WD 500 GB HDD & it is working fine if I plug it in another computer as a slave hard disk - but it wont work (rather wont even spin) in the casing!The casing is the culprit & not the HDD.-Rajat"
5,wonderful dvd series,"Over the summer at my church, the bible study group I am in did Crazy Love and I loved it!!!!! We read the book along with the dvd. This series is very powerful!! It has changed my life so much!!! If you want to get closer to God and change your life for the better I highly recommend this bible study dvd and book. I am so much happier now than I was before Crazy Love!"
2,"Crazy Love is wonderful, but...","Crazy Love is a wonderful book; relevant and challenging to today's Christian. However this Resource DVD is not what I hoped it would be. I have been studying Crazy Love with my 20 yr old son (who is in Iraq currently) and his fiancé. We read a chapter per week and I come up with questions for us to answer that will challenge us on what we learned. I was hoping the resource would be something that Francis Chan could give me extra help with for challenging questions. That is not the case. I would have preferred a study guide book with chapter questions, but this DVD is just a camera following him around during the day as he talks about the chapters, sort of, and I may only get ONE thought provoking question out of each chapter. It was not worth the money. Sorry Francis. But I would totally recommend the book... just not the DVD."
3,Just a costume tail...,"We used this for a home-made Mickey Mouse costume and it worked okay, but I think it would be more suitable as a cat tail because of the furriness and thickness. There is a loop at the end so that it can be held on with a belt, but since my kid's costume had no belt, I sewed the loop directly onto the costume. The tail is wired to hold a shape, which is good, except that it makes the tail so heavy that it caused the costume to sag in the rear end. Overall an okay product, nothing really good or bad to say about it."
4,Captivating and engrossing,"I really liked it -- but it's not for everyone.Imagine the difference between a French movie about ants, and a Hollywood movie about ants. This is the French version -- meandering, doesn't follow a clear narrative, revels in the details, the humans are a bit ""weird"" about their motivations, and there are no world-conquering ants the size of VW bugs out to eat us.Instead, it takes a more realistic approach -- and I think, altogether more satisfying one. By the end, I was quite spellbound by the possibilities it had raised, and cannot wait to read the sequels (which someone below said were out in French, but not translated yet).Basically, if you're at all interested in science and how things in Nature work, you'll love this book. If not -- well, go rent the old 1954 Warner Bros. movie THEM! about world-conquering ants the size of VW Bugs."
5,It's totally awesome and it's just the beginning,"This book is wonderful. After reading this book, Bernard Werber became my favorite author. Who would have thought ants could be so interesting ? A lot of readers think human characters are not as good written as ants, that's probably true for that book but not for the following one, which is, I think, the best one. However I'm sure most of the readers tried to build 4 equilateral triangles out of 6 matches... Being french, I read the Trilogy (as well as his other books) and as several people said : the end is really the beginning. To conclude, I met Bernard Werber several times and he's as much interesting as his books."
4,I'll never use raid again,This author could write any genre he wants. He definitely researched his topic. Bernard Werber has a gift of keeping the reader in the dark without allowing him or her to lose their way. I found the translation weak at times but the story was so good I did not mind. A casual observer would try to compare this Watership Down. In that Novel the animals talk. In Empire of the Ants they communicate but like ants not humans. Werber even pays homage to ant researcher and author E.O. Wilson. The scientist's name in the story is Edmund Wells. An excellent read with lots of information along the journey.
1,Very disappointing,"Very thin on plot; the great mystery turns out to not so great in the end. Ant and human characters are weakly developed. Either skip this book altogether or borrow it from the library; don't waste money on it! Better: read Watership Down or Plague Dogs, instead."
2,"A good idea, better without people.","Empire of the Ants is a fascinating view of these social insects. By showing the ants' alien thought process in a context that the average reader can understand, Werber has created an incredibly vivid portrait of the world under our feet. The problem lies with the human characters that interact with the ants, leading to an anticlimax that takes away from the ""Empire's"" own struggles. Allowing humans to be supporting characters in this genre(Watership Down) may be helpful but they should not actively participate. It takes away from the world that was created and lessens it."
3,good for beginner,"I have a few detailed books, but none show complete start to finish setup. This is a low quality made video, but will walk you through an entire setup from start to finish. I would reccommend this product!"
3,"More, please!","I gave this DVD 3 stars because I have seen this episode - it is terrific. However, I will not be shelling out [money] for 1 episode... I'll be saving it to put it towards the purchase of the entire 1st season on DVD, when and if that is released! Gimme a break, Universal!"
3,Not as great as the review state,"I had some Elegance seat covers that were very good about 10 years ago. That's how long they lasted! Full velour front and back, and many straps with metal hooks to keep them tight to the cushion springs. These Fairfield covers come with TWO PLASTIC hooks which can't possibly keep them tight. The only velour is on the seating surface. The rest is a stretchy polyester that is not unlike pantyhose. I just can't see these lasting more than a year. Yeah, the price is low but I would gladly pay double for some full coverage like my old seat covers."
2,Can't Disguise Lack of Ideas Behind Technical Wizardry,"The opener ""Blood & Tears"" is a moving, brilliant piece of music altering between delicate Indian vocals and Steve's masterful chops and - extraordinary enough - restrained play. ""I'll Be Around"" catches some of the atmosphere of ""Sex&Religion"" album. It has a pleasant tune but would be performed better by a guy like Devin Townsend on vocals instead of Steve. The rest of the tracks is stuffed with futile gimmicks making it a boasting demontration in musical craftmanship ending in itself. Vai becomes a slave of his own musical talent. Playing at least a dozen different chords in two seconds is no proof for making good rock music. Sorry, Stevie, try again once more. I know you can do MUCH better."
1,zappa clone,"I loved Passion & Warfare, it didn't leave my CD player for months! I feel Steve left his great gtr playing at home for this one, and was content on recording noises & dumb lyrics, I was so disapointed! Pass this one by unless you liked Frank Zappa's music (yuk! )"
1,Mas de lo mismo. Todo sigue igual,"Nuevo cd de Steve, ¿seguro que nuevo? ¿o tan solo su propio plagio de Fire Garden? Este hombre ya no tiene ideas. Las mismas escalas, los mismos arpegios, los mismos efectos. En definitiva, mas de lo mismo. Atras quedaron los tiempos del Passion and Warfare, una pena. Ya no aporta nada, que hay del fresco Steve Vai, de sus tiempos con David Lee Roth. Demasiado mayor supongo. La voz es horrible ¿por que demonios canta el? ¿acaso no tiene dinero para pagar un buen vocalista? Y tampoco los musicos, por favor, mete un buen bateria,un buen bajista y un buen teclista en todo el disco, tu limitate a tocar la guitarra, que es lo que sabes hacer. A ver si el proximo es mejor, porque es tu ultima oportunidad"
1,"This c.d., like his others lacks punch","In general, I can tell you that I like how Steve Vai plays the guitar. He learned from Joe, what else can you say...The only thing is that Steve Vai fails to show what he can really do on his c.d.s. I hope that he will take a lesson from his mentor and finally put out a c.d. with a great song on every track."
5,I've come to expect so much from Vai and he always delivers!,This is truly an amazing CD. If you're into guitar you'll love it. If you're not into guitar you'll still absolutely love this CD. Buy It Now!!! Every song is just awesome! Mind blowing guitar. Incomparable musicianship and arrangement. I can't describe how great this CD really is!
2,"A turn for the worse, Steve!","I am a long-standing Steve Vai fan but I too, like Matthew from PA, have a ""Love/Hate"" relationship with his music. OK,OK...we all know of Steve's technical wizardry! However, compositionally, The Ultra Zone doesn't even come close to what Passion and Fire gave us. Sorry Steve...this one's a miss, but hey, I'll keep waiting for the best that's yet to come!"
3,"does not make you a king of crown molding, but it helps","Crown molding is confusing, this set up helped though my angles still didn't meet up...but I was so close. I'll blame it on the miter saw."
5,Makes Crown Easier,"I was reluctant to use this as I figured how hard can it be. I am hear to tell you that this product has made cutting crown much easier. I have never done it before and I tried cutting crown without it but in the matter of 1 hour I had 2 corners done and they are as close to perfect as you can get. I will have to do a little ""patch work"" but minimal compared to what I was looking at without it. The only problem I have is the fact that I have a 10"" Compound Miter Saw and this product reduces the cutting capacity so the largest molding I can do is about 3 5/8"". For larger crown I am going to have to buy a new Miter Saw (darn) and use this tool to do the holding. I recommend this product to anyone that has limited experience cutting crown as well as those who need to do a lot."
5,Intense and nailbiting,"This is an excellent thriller about ""the dark side of fame"". It's also about the many different ways in which famous people are 'seen' by those who come into contact with them: through TV, press, public relations, and through our own confused attitudes. Through a clever, subtly twisting plot, it explores the difference - the fine line - between romantic passion and the kind of pathological obsession displayed by certain kinds of stalker. The message it leaves you with is disturbing, but strangely convincing. It sure as hell isn't Mary Higgins Clarke (strictly for kids). But it will hold your attention."
1,Where's the Skating?,"Gee, for a book supposedly about a skater, there sure isn't much skating in it. In fact there isn't any. As for the skating community being upset over issues being raised... What issues? Where? If the book spent any time talking about eating disorders, the harsh life a skater has, skating injuries, the dangers of skating without a helmet, skaters with drug problems, skaters sexually abused by their coaches (all very real and important issues that I would welcome in a book), I must have missed it. Did the author write another secret book that exposed problems in the figure skating world? This book was about a celebrity (who incidently was a skater in another life) being stalked. And if you've read one book about a celebrity stalker, you've read them all. This one wasn't even a particulary well-written one."
1,Memory modules,"These memory modules were only usable in Sony computers and of no use to me. The seller has agreed to accept their return for a refund but I will still be out the shipping cost, approximately $30. A better description of the suitability of the memory modules is required."
3,Poor fit for Ipod 30GB,"My problem with this case is that it doesn't fit my 30GB Ipod Photo. The opening for the screen is too small, so I have to strain to see the left border. It is also too fat, front to back. There must be a quarter of an inch space between the back of the Ipod, and the back of the case. I trimmed down the foam insert that came with the case and managed to cram it down in there, but it is still a sloppy fit. I have no issue with the belt clip, because I have no use for it."
3,El cheapo verson of d-link 900AP,"This is basically d-link 900AP but in:a) much uglier and bulkier caseb) with no external and no internal antenna connectors, pigtailantennas are ugly soldered to the boardc) the power supply is much heavier and bulkierI haven't tested it's range in comparison to d-link 900AP yet, though.Since you can get d-link 900AP for a couple of bucks more - I would go with 900AP."
5,pardonnez-moi! je ne suis trompé!,"'Faut que je dise que ce CD est super! J'ÉCOUTE France D'amour depuis son premier album, et elle a grandit beaucoup avec sa musique. Je recommande ce Cd à tous! Elle a enregistré 3 chansons de nouvelles pour ce disque, et les autres sont ses meilleures. Si vous aimez France, ce cd vous donnerez une sommaire ce toute sa carrière dans preque une heure! Great CD, its a Greatest HITS cd, three new songs, and i recommand it to all"
5,"Petrucciani's 'Playground""","Michel Petrucciani had a prolific output during his short life, and on several different labels, I believe. When I want to hear something funky, this is one of the discs I reach for. While I find it an unusual release for Blue Note-always thought they were more about ""straight ahead""-it showcases a pianist on top of his game! Had heard this years ago and had forgotten about this particular release, but not about him! Everything I've heard from Michel is always played with feeling and virtuosity, but this album jams! It's obvious he was having fun and the other musicians complement this outing. Some may dismiss this as so much ""smooth jazz"";(I'm not concerned about labels, I like what I like!) if it is, it's got kick! If you like to bop your head and pat your foot, get this disc!"
5,Pleased,"Both my husband and I are pleased with this attractive motion-activated light. It has a lens shield one can position on a portion of the sensor to block a desired area, for example, the seating area on our porch, which is exactly what we wanted. Not only do I like its simple lines, but I also like how it does not look like a utilitarian motion-activated light. Plus, it was shipped promptly."
2,WORKS SOMETIMES,"We've had this light in our front entry for about a year and a half and we are very dissatisfied with it.It's a good-looking entry fixture but it only turns on intermittently. About half the time, it works beautifully. About the half the time, we stand in front of the door, waving our arms repeatedly before it finally decides to detect the motion.No...we would not recommend it and we would not buy it again."
4,Nice light,Very nice light and great for those who work late. Now I can see to unlock the house without leaving the porch light on all evening.
1,Doesn't work as advertised.,"I don't understand how this fixture works, sometimes it works with motion and other times it works like dawn to dusk. I would have returned it but i tossed all the packaging."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"We purchased 21 of these. 20 out of the lot are defective. The Lightning ""Jump Drives"" have a rubber/plastic molding that holds the front and back of the jump drive together. The cap is built the same way. Upon removing the drives from the package, and removing the caps, most of them cracked and parts of the plastic fell off. We contacted Lexar (brush up on your Indian language skills before calling) and did not get anywhere with them..... I would NOT recommend buying from Lexar. We returned the products to PC Mall, and exchanged them for SanDisk Cruzer Titaniums. MUCH BETTER!"
1,Lexar dropped the ball,"This is my third lexar jumpdrive, I have the original purple USB 1.1, a 512mb secure, and now the 1GB lightning. I expected great quality as before, with a metal case, you expect durability, but this unit falls short. The size is great and I got it at a great price, however now 4 months after purchase the cap will not stay on, it pops off all the time, I have had to crawl half way under my car twice to get it. I have always been impressed with Lexar, but this item falls far short compared to other units they have made. I would suggest saving your money."
3,Disappointed,"After reading all the great reviews here I decided to buy this DVD. One of the reviewers said it is better than the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over DVD. That's basically what made me decide to buy it.I find that the first 2 songs and the last half hour of the concert are pretty good. The hour in between though seems kind of slow. So I rate it 3/5. I think if you know Spanish that would help since it is all sung in Spanish. However I don't, so I can only comment on the music itself, not on the lyrics. Also note there are no subtitles. Subtitles would have helped me."
4,Excellent mix of Science fiction and religion,An abyss of light is very good book. Any Science Fiction reader with an interest in Religous philosphies should read this book. A Great opposition between God(Epgael) and The Mashiah(Milcom). Rachel and her people must decide who is real while Jerimiel is trying to save Gament Civilization from a horrible Extiction. Very well written. I didn't get bored for a moment.
1,Uuuuugh....,"At first I was quite thrilled about getting this album, but I soon discovered that the lyrics and the ideals of the band support a strong white-supremist point of view that is stronly Neo-Nazi. Just read their lyrics and you can see what I am talking about. Even worse, their music is very poor and uneventful. Just another band thrying to follow some trendy scene. Don't waste your time on talentless blackmetal like this. Try Ulver or Mysticum instead."
2,"good looks, little performance","I love the look of the Dale Jr. scanner and headset. I hate the scanner itself. I took the scanner to the Bristol Race last weekend. I could not pick up the local race frequency. I could only tune in to a few drivers. Most of all, general reception was horrible. This item should have never been sponsored by NASCAR or their drivers. You can get a great scanner, with great reception at radioshack for $99.99. NASCAR should have just sold the headsets, without the scanner."
2,Not a good product,I purchased these for my husband and he was very disappointed. The ear pieces kept falling out of his ears. I would not recommend this product.
1,Horrible scanner!,I had this scanner at the track this past weekend and was very disappointed!! You couldn't make out what was said by the driver/crew and I had the volume all the way up. The radio station the race was on didn't even come in clear. May be a problem with the antenna?
3,Bought for a single song,I ran across this CD and the one song of hers I knew along with a good price made me buy it. Slip and slide.
1,Fox Lorber releases yet another substandard DVD,This is an amusing film with many cameos from well-known French film stars. Unfortunately Fox Lorber continues in their tradition of releasing substandard DVDs. The transfer is horribly blurry and the subtitles are burned into the print and not removable. Order at your own risk.
3,difficulty to see in the evening or early AM,"works as advertized and under bright light works well, outside temp sensor works well with the unit upstairs and sensor downstairs outside wall. Only gripe is when little dar, very difficult to see the lettering..."
4,As advertised,"No complaints. Clock and internal displays work great, outside temp is probably a couple of degrees off depending on where the sun is coming from but for the price who can complain. It looks great if you are into contemporary decor and it is accurate."
4,Great produce,I've bought one of these clocks before and knew I would like this one as much as I did the other ones I've bought.
4,very nice product clear and very precise with both temps,"Very clear and precise with both temps and time, thought it would be a little larger than it really is though"
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this clock and it worked well for about 4 months. Now, it just does what it wants - when it wants - even though I changed the battery .It's in the same location as always, so I can't figure out what is wrong, somethimes the date doesn't show up, or, all of a sudden the time changes, different things at different times. I really liked it at first, but think I'll spend a little more money for something that is more reliable (hopefully)"
2,NOT WORTH IT,After repeated attempts and multiple locations the clock was unable to (1) receive the WWVB signal and (2) display the correct outside temperature. Don't waste your time and money buy another product.
5,weather clock,"This La Crosse Weather Clock w/remote temperature is one amazing item,once it is set-up it give you a very acurate review of the outside and inside temp. as well the moon status and date and time..."
1,i would give it a negative star rating if i could,"while the idea is excellent, the technology is faulty. i followed the instructions exactly. the time set itself and so did the temperature - only thing, the temperature sensor was defective.at one point, i had both the indoor and outdoor sensors about 1 yard away from each other and the temperature reading was over 1 degree different! overall the temperature reading was 5 degrees off, when compared to two ""traditional"" thermometers.when i called cs they gave me these silly instructions to follow to ""reset"" the unit (press the reset button 25 times at 1 second intervals, c'mon) then i finally got an honest cs person who said the unit was defective. i have a feeling this company won't be around for too long."
4,Does the job,I love it; especially since it has the phases of the moon on it. It does differ by 3 degrees by both what my thermostat says and the news/weather channel says it is outside. But it's close and I can't complain. It updated itself during daylight savings which was fun.
3,At least it looks good,"This is my fourth La Crosse product experience, and I'd assess the company as I cut or two above a toy maker. You get what you pay for. Each of the other purchases -- two clocks and a weather station -- each had flaws in operation and endurance. This clock I was compelled to set manually after it failed to set itself at a location where another atomic clock received the signal. Perhaps, now, it finally is receiving the signal, but since I initially set the time percisely, far be it for me to know for certain. Still it is a handsome clock. Too bad it lacks a button to force it to search immediately for the time-setting signal, as does my other non-La Crosse clock."
1,OUTDOOR SENSOR DOES NOT WORK,"I bought this item as a gift for the outdoor temperature feature. The item looks great, but it ends up being just an expensive clock because the temperature sensor does not work! After reading other reviews it seems like other people had this problem after it rained. What good is an outdoor sensor if it stops working after raining? This is my first time giving a 1 star rating for any product I've purchased on Amazon. WASTE OF MONEY."
3,The Clock works fine. Setting it up is kind of ridiculous.,"The clock is fine, the moon phase mode is awesome. It's very easy to read, and the temperature device for indoor is very accurate. However, the setting up the external sensor to sense the outdoor temperature is very annoying. If you don't do the steps in the most precise order ever, then you have to take out all the batteries, and wait 15 minutes before you can even attempt to reset it. At least the alarm is worth it."
1,Drains Batteries,"I had a little trouble initially getting the outdoor temp. to display. But eventually got it to work. However, not even a week after setting it up, the low sensor battery display is showing and I am not getting an outside temp. Now I didn't use any cheap batteries either. I used Energizer, which have always lasted very long for every other use. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't want to replace batteries every week just to get the temp. from my room. The reason I bought this was for the outdoor temp. so therefore, I wasted my money,"
2,Good concept but... Unreliable,"This review is after owning the clock for 2 years. I preferred this since it was matching my furniture. Even after following all the instructions, it would not show outdoor temperature. Then I decided to return it and get another one. The new clock started working perfectly. Atomic clock showing different moon phases, indoor and outdoor phases. unfortunately it lasted only for 3 months and then stopped showing outdoor temperature. after 1 yr of use, the clock was not Atomic anymore and stopped working. tried changing batteries multiple times with no success. Not recommended.Pros: slick designgood conceptCons: defective outdoor sensorUnreliable"
1,can't speak to this product,"I use Lacrosse in my home, this was to be a gift. It came with some ceramic flower pots. Non of tthe objects were packed securely the pots were broken and bouncing around with the clock, so it goes back as well.I don't know right now whether the seller's shipped I think they came from the ware house, so pay attention to who is shipping you packages this is the crazy time of year."
3,"It has a lot of features, but display is hard to see.","I like the clock in general and it does all it's suppose to do, but I find the display difficult to see clearly unless you are directly in front of it. Viewing it from just a little angle makes it bad. Oregon Scientific displays work much better."
2,Out door temperature doesn't work!,The outdoor temperature does not work. This was a gift and the receiving party has tried many batteries and move the sensor to different locations. Still does not function. The clock works just fine. How can this problem be resolved? A new temperature sensor would be accetable. Shirley Taylor
4,NEW FORMULA Greenies,"I had used Greenies for my dogs a few years ago and was concerned about them being a choking or swallowing (whole) hazard.I was just at my Vet's today and she said she didn't USE TO recommend Greenies, but the company changed the formula and now she does.The NEW formula breaks into bits as the dog chews, and is also more digestible. If the dog happened to swallow the whole Greenie, it WOULD dissolve in the stomach just fine.HOWEVER, as my Vet cautioned, get the RIGHT SIZE Greenie for your dog, so that if doggie does swallow it, it won't present a blockage risk.My only complaint with this product is that they don't last long, as my little guy gobbles it up frantically..."
4,Good add on,"I got this cage to add onto my other two hamster cages. I have a crittertrail two and a crittertrail outlook. The cage is too small to be a dwarf hamster's only home, but it is a great add-on. If the cage will be put in a bedroom you will need to take out the wheel because it is really loud. I reccomend the silent spinner by super pet or the fly wheel by habitrail. Overall a good cage."
2,Not a lot of flava,"I agree with Ay from New Jersey. I, too, am a huge fan of Tarkan, and was looking forward to this album. For me it turned out to be a bit of a bust. Here and there we get glimpses of his Turkish genius, but for the most part, ""Come Closer"" sounds like every other R&B Lite album out there. I was expecting a much more creative blend of East and West. It is unfortunate that the Pussycat Dolls' ""Buttons"" has more impact than much of the material on this album. It almost seems as if Tarkan were writing music to cater to ""American"" tastes, rather than writing from the heart. If this is the case, then Tarkan, be true to yourself. Your fans love your creativity."
5,"tarkan is simple amazing, karlla maravilla, el salvador....","i been tarkans fun since 1999 too like other people and i was waitig for this album for so long, if you are planning to buy it , buy it dont mis the chance to learn a/b turkish music and culture and dont miss those sounds that transport you to turkey...my song is ORORUM SANNA i love it, come closer its just a masterpiece , HE IS AMAZING.....KARLLA"
3,Word of warning: On Demand version has no subtitles,"The ""free preview"" doesn't give a clear indication, so I didn't find out until after renting it that the On Demand version of this film doesn't seem to have subtitles. However, from the little bit I watched I could tell that if either 1) I knew Spanish or 2) the film was subtitled, I'd probably enjoy it. So for that reason I gave this item 3 stars, meant to indicate a neutral opinion."
4,Fun for little ones,Cute puzzle for little boys. Large pieces are great for 2 year olds! Very durable toy. Melissa and Doug brand is the best.
4,Almost as good as EyeQ,"Like the title says, almost as good as EyeQ - but at one tenth the price - great value!!!"
2,Flimsy and dented,I am very disappointed in this product. The metal is very flimsy and itarrived with several dents in the sides. I certainly expected higherquality from a manufacturer like Bodum.
2,Cheap from beginning to the end,"This infuser is cheaply made. It is that simple. When I received the product, it was clear to me that this thing was a flawed product. First, this infuser was shipped to me without proper casing and indeed I noticed some bumps which weren't too bad however they were certainly noticeable in close inspection.Second, if you look closely at how they melded this stainless steel infuser, you will see why I say this was cheaply made. It was just amateurishly done even I can do better.Third, they put some kind of stick at the bottom of the infuser and frankly, I spent 20 minutes trying to get it off completely. And of course I ended up with very scratched infuser bottom. I don't know what kind of glue it was but it stuck to infuser bottom and simply refused to scrape off.I would recommend future buyers to stay away from this product. I know I will never buy product from Bodum in the future for sure."
2,"Ugly orange light, not bright enough","I was surprised how orange the light it from this night light. It was not at all what I was expecting. It also barely throws any light! It is much less light than my old incandescent. Also, it's very wasteful because my bathroom doesn't have windows, so it's almost always on. There is no timer override or anything to shut it off manually.Also, the plug is useless, because when you plug something into it's really hard to get in and out, and you have to remove the night light from the socket anyway."
3,LED saves on electricity,Purchased this item for a very small vanity area so that I wouldn't cover up one of the few plugs in the area. It does work well for that and I like the fact that it has automatic off and on. The LED lights are not really as bright has I hoped for and brighter light would make it a perfect product.
1,Hitachi stinks,"I have this tv and after 3 years it needed a bulb replacement so they gave me the number of their distributor, i ORDERED IT FOR 159.00 then in 5 days got the part but the cover would not go back on so I called and was told I was given a generic bulb because Hitachi stopped making the part and there had been 3 others who had ordered this and had the same problem. It would of been nice if they would of explained all of this when I ordered the part not after waiting and spending so much time trying to get it to work. No to mention it only being three years old and they stopped making parts for it!!!!!!!!! I called them and they could care less!!! Customer service is not good!!!Now I have a big T.v after three years to just throw out!!!!!!!!!!! How green is that? Not to mention it was not cheap!!"
3,Some Fine Tuning,"This armband fulfills its purpose as long as you don't want to change the volume or music. It is a little hard to initially put the ipod in the case, but once you get it in there it is pretty snug. The plastic case on the outside does make it hard to adjust the music."
2,Running out of steam...,"I've been following PSB for two decades now, and I'm convinced they've run out of steam. The last few albums have been extremely spotty, and this one even more so. Sure, there's always a terrific single or two. And the remixes on the bonus disc are thumpy in all the right places. But they seem incapable of pulling off an entire album of arresting and memorable moments. Nothing here begs for repeated listens, and that is what ultimately flaws this collection. Even the assistance of producer Trevor Horn doesn't inspire. From the simply humdrum to the absolutely excrutiating, ""Fundamental"" is the sound of the Boys who have very little left to offer."
5,Like a fine wine,"Yes, the PSB are like a fine wine that just gets better with age. After being disappointed with ""Release"" I was a little leary about this new offering, but my fears were dismissed as soon as I popped the disc in. ""Fundamental"" in my oppinion is one of their best cd's to date. It does remind me of the days of ""Very"". It contains the perfect blend of uptempo pop and classic slower tracks. You can't go wrong with this cd. Buy it today and you will be glad you did!"
1,Quit working,"A week after owning this enclosure, the hard drive started clicking on and off and windows would not recognize the drive. After troubleshooting, I found the problem to be with the power connection to the drive. The hard drive works fine in another sata enclosure. Don't waste your money."
2,Heat problems,"Made for bad DVR enclosure. The external ATA connection is nice, but heat problems kept bouncing the drive making it useless for anything you need 100% uptime for. Provided you can get your files over to it without choking, could make a passable backup drive."
4,Heard them in concert,"I've never heard of these guys before, but i saw them in concert with Pat Benetar and i was really impressed. they have a great sound and you can definitely get into it. they are great on stage as well as on CD. i recommend this band as something new and if you are tired of all the bubble gum ""rock"" - these guys will remind you of what real music sounds like."
1,F*****g C**p,"Well I admit it - I own every original Millie J CD/Lp ever released. This is one I have listened too maybe 4 or 5 times. It remains a f*****g stinker.Sorry Millie you tell it like it is - hell why not me. Listen to your last album release ""Not for church folk"". That is class, m***** f*****g class. As great as the most underrated of your vast repartee funny song fest ""back to the s**t""Keep on raping Millie JTony"
5,Guitar melodies from an other planet!!,Have you thought Steve couldn't get any further?Here's the proof!The Song Melissa's Garden is the most harmonic thing I've ever heard...It really blasts you away!The two other songs are amazing as well.I am afraid of what Steve will do in the next ten years...
2,Stopped Working After a Year,"As mentioned by others - works really well and can be set up to play all region disks - but mine stopped working after about a year - disks spin in player, but are not recognized. Only cost me $36 - so no real complaints; you get what you pay for."
2,Cyberhome went bankrupt,"Please note that it is no longer possible to get ANY customer support, warranty coverage nor even downloadable manuals or upgrades. Purchasing a Cyberhome model of any kind is a poor proposition, owing to their high rate of failure, and, oh, that detail about their being out of business. Try it yourself: [...]"
3,Plays everything but won't last long,"We've had several of this DVD player, all breaking down within less then a year. It's true that it plays everything, including all region codes and it is small - that's why we kept replacing it with the same model. But all we owned had similar problems: after a while it stopped reacting to buttons (one never opened the DVD slot any more), or played the DVDs ""broken up"". So now I'm lookiing for a new model that can do the same but wont' need to be replaced all the time."
2,Severely inferior to the Oz books,"This book is a real let down after reading all the Oz Books. It doesn't have anywhere near the sparkle and pop of Baum's other series and seems much more like a list of what-could-be sightings than a worthwhile story. That's truly a shame because I was hoping to ""keep the magic alive"" (as it were) for my young children after finishing all the Oz books.The story line is simple - Trot and Cap'n Bill (both migrated to Oz after a few more books) are temporarily transformed into a mermaid & merman for undersea adventures. They get captured by an evil wizard and eventually freed. The drawback is that the sea offers less of a chance for Oz's remarkable imagination since he has to work with observable items and make them seem fantastical. He just doesn't have as much room to work with as he does in Oz, which offers boundless opportunities for his near-endless imagination.Maybe a Baum completist would enjoy this more, but it wasn't for me."
2,A Moronic Sappy Waste of Time. This Book is a Fluke.,"Even if you are a certified Baum fan, like me, don't bother reading this book. It has no plot, no interesting characters, and in fact no rising action or climax to speak of. Nothing important happens until 3/4 of the way into it, and the rest is sappy bilge. Skip directly to the sequal, Sky Island, which is much, much better."
5,Adventure shared with your best friend,This book was written establishing relationships between a curious girl and a family friend. They set off on a day trip that becomes a journey of good and evil. There are surprises of all types. New friends are made throughout the ocean and some lost contacts are found. I do recommend this book. I do see an element of the Wizard of the underwater OZ.
2,A dance routine,Good music. It will take some time and more space than I have to work with for this routine. I just make my own moves and imagine that I have other people exercising with me. Before I learn one step he has already launched into another.
3,Alfred Publishing didn't do so well...,"First, compared to the old DCI vids, the video transfer looks a bit washed out like an old Honeymooners episode. Secondly, and probably most importantly, a lot of sound has been lost. Perfect example, in Peart's solo, the high-hat and ride are completely muted. Overall, a very muffled sounding DVD. Believe me, I've tried this DVD through several different entertainment systems with the same results. So don't expect an enhanced sound. Quite the opposite. However, and finally, due to the convenience of DVD navagation, and of course some of the finest performances by some of the greatest drummers, I would still add this DVD to any music collection."
5,Cool book!,"Danielle is a wealthy girl living with her parents on a plantation near New Orleans. Danielle is engaged to quiet Paul, who offers her a comfortable life. But when she is captured by pirates, Danielle meets Geoffory Laffiete, and falls in love with him as well. Which man will win Danielle's heart?"
5,Buy it it's GREAT,"After waiting so long to get my hands on a copy of this cd I was not dissappointed, it really is super, everyone should have one for those sad days and for the happy days BUY IT"
5,The Best CD of the Year,"This CD came out near the end of 2005 and was by far the best CD of the year. My girlfriend who ""hates"" Neil Diamond usually only likes of the present was blown away by this CD as well.If you are thinking BIG Neil songs from the 70s or 80s, you will be in for a surprise. This CD is soulful and simple. It is profound and insightful."
4,good old fashioned hero,"I love the Sharpe series. Good old fashioned hero, lots of sly fun and enough romance to keep a woman (ME) watching inspite of the war theme. Honor and loyalty abound. Try this one but really consider watching the entire series."
5,sharpe's challenge dvd movie,"Good movie,good service. It added to my collection of the Sharpe series.Thank you.marilyn poole"
4,Sharpe's resurrection - Sharpe's Challenge,"this video follows in the grand tradition of the Sharpe's series but in order to make the ageing of the lads more plausible, an earlier book in the series was manipulated to put Sharpie back in the field - his latest wife dispensed with in a sentence. Although Sean Bean can still fit into his rifleman's uniform, the boys are getting a bit long in the tooth. All of us Sharpaholics can only regret that the BBC was not prescient enough to make a dozen more episodes before killing off the Chosen Men at Waterloo. I watched an older, wiser Sharpe and and older Harper and realized that I was older too. I think this will be the last time Sharpe and Harper march."
3,Sharps Challenge DVD,Disapointing.The novels were much better. There seemed to be huge chunks missing.
5,One of Dostoyevskys Best,This novel shows why this writer is considered one the worlds greatest. It is highly entertaining and thought provoking. Read It.
2,Nice Frame - Hard to Stand Up,These frames are nice to look at but the frame stand that holds the picture up stretches so far to the back of the frame that it takes a lot of room in depth to stand up. The frames are very nice to look at but the backs are not convenient and take up too much space.
5,Cool dragon,"This is a very fierce, detailed, good looking dragon. He is great for battling other dragons, two at a time, and knights."
1,Now and Zen has the worst customer service Period !,"All the negative reviews are correct. Now and Zen provides the worst experience I've had with customer service in over 5 years. What could have been an excellent product is really just junk. Yes they look nice but as alarm clocks they are horrible. But even if you are getting them for just looks if you ever have a problem with them, you will most likely end up with pure frustration. There staff and training is pathetic. Don't waste your breath and find another alternative for better waking."
1,Poor reliability and customer service,"We own a Now and Zen product that stopped working just out of warranty. I've tried to contact now and Zen by e-mail and by phone to purchase replacement parts. I didn't want anything for free, but never got a reply. I also called and left messages but got no reply.Finally, I e-mailed them with a question as if I were a new customer wanting to buy. When I received a reply, I asked about replacement parts. They never replied."
2,"MOVIE FALLS FLAT...and Yes, I am a man and ""got it.""","Wow, I have to disagree with the majority of the reviewers of this sorry excuse for entertainment. I thought that story was full of potential: a beautiful woman proving she can manipulate a man, particularly a vulnerable man. There was no doubt that an attractive woman is capable of such actions, and there are plenty of men more than willing to be taken advantage of. What I waited over one hour for was to try to understand why would a woman want to make these changes. The explanation at the end did not seem believable at all. I was more than a little disappointed! At least the movie I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES (also about a beautiful and controlling woman) made some sense even though it was a sleazy movie."
2,Just plain dumb...shock value isn't always a good goal,"No synopsis needed. The movie aims to shock, and it doesn't even do that well. If it was meant to open the mind then it didn't achieve that goal either."
3,"Well, I'd do what Evelyn said too!","Actually, I found this to be rather pointed. An MFA student (Evelyn) who reminded me of many pomo chicks I have known, decides to see how completely she can get a guy (Adam) to change for her- from his image to his friends. This was as drastic as it was because he had no idea they didn't have a real relationship and that she was doing everything she was doing in order to document it and then put it on display- but really it was just illustrating the nature of many relationships hyperbolically. The actress made a really good sociopath.. woooo. And c'mon, the guy did look better later- but his ""before"" photo was like one of those from a magazine makeover where they mess up their hair first and put them against a paste-colored background so Evelyn kinda cheated"
4,Totally Twisted,"This movie, to put it bluntly, was mean, sadistic, and beyond twisted. It showed how you appearance can change so much about you, how much some people would do for their lovers.Now, I didn't really like the movie. I thought it was horrible how much that girl put that boy through for the sake of ""art."" But in the same sense, I think everyone should see it.This movie really made me think about many things. It made me think of myself, my actions, things that I had done all in the sake of ""love,"" all in the sake for being deemed attractive.For the sake of art, see this movie. It will make you think."
2,"MOVIE FALLS FLAT...and Yes, I am a man and ""got it.""","Wow, I have to disagree with the majority of the reviewers of this sorry excuse for entertainment.

3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. Only the first half of the book deals specifically with the law of Moses and its relation to Christ. While doing so, I often thought Poythress was finding symbolism where none existed.The second half of the book deal with modern society. That is, how does the Law of Moses affect us today? How should it affect our 21st century laws? He also includes a critique of modern prisons (which he rightly sees as complete failures), a critique of theonomy and a lengthy discussion of what Jesus meant with he said he came to fulfill the law.This book is good but not great. If you are looking for an easy introduction this is a good place to start."
3,"Lots of information, but hard to read","This book was recommended by a bible study friend's husband. While it contains a huge amount of information, the writing style is very hard for me to get into. I have not gotten even half way through the book, unfortunately, because I find myself slogging through following the author and wishing he would take out the excessive wordiness and get more to the point. Topics are made into excruciating long chapters, where I think they could be written about in a much less lengthy manner while still conveying the information that the author wanted to get across. I find myself struggling to understand exactly what it is the author was trying to convey within so many words, i.e. where he is trying to go with the subject. I consider myself able to read scholarly books and subjects, but this book feels like reading War and Peace."
1,"Maybe Prada, but it's not necessarily Quality","I bought this for a gift. Well...she didn't like it and Amazon's return policy didn't allow me to return it. Go figure. I'm stuck with an $80 piece of cheap feeling nylon that my wife doesn't like. Basically, it doesn't feel like a quality bag, though the picture looks nice."
3,i was pleased,its a cute bag. but it is a little smaller than I expected. I think it's less of a day to day bag and more for going out at night as you cant put very much into it. All in all I'm a satisfied.
3,Great when I was a kid,"When I was a kid I loved reading this book. I've read it three times, and each time it gets worse. Now, it's just so so. It's got serious plot problems at the very end. Up until then it's great, mysterious, intriguing, but the author seems to have gotten lazy by the final chapter."
2,junk for the price,"I bought one of these for work it. It worked great for afew monthes till the ball started to get afew slices in it. Then one day it exploded on my desk while squeezing it I had to clean it up and the colored gooe inside staind my desk alittle. I order 2 more and had to baby them and make sure my finger nailes and any thing eles dident slice in to it after afew monthes of squeezing and trying to be carefully while doing it they still got slices in them. I supper glued the spot and still use them now and then at home, but I'm waiting for them to do it agin. I emailed the company about it but as you would gusse no reply"
4,Not as good as Lynch but still....,"Buddy Boy is a good movie. I have just seen it for the first time after a long wait. I bought this movie because there were many references to David Lynch works, and I have to admit it's quite obvious. But it not a bad thing. Hanlon is clearly not as talented as Lynch, but still, the plot is quite good. The ending tho, is just plain confusion.If you like strange movies you'll probably like this one."
2,"Sorry, but Extreme did it better","Did you ever hear the saying, three's a crowd?? Well, that's what these guys are, the crowd. Chilli Peppers and Extreme already had a monopoly on this type of music, and sadly these guys don't come close to their caliber of band.One positive from this album is the song, I Do You. It's actually not a bad song, but sadly the rest of the album left alot to be desired. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this album, unless you are a big funk-metal fan from late 80's or early 90's."
1,Um....Yea.......Um..............................................,"Ok......when I first saw Lazy Town I thought that it was one of the dumbest shows ever. And this DVD proves it. The story is that Sporticus is taking a break as being a super hero, and the bezarre pink-haired Stephine becomes ""Sporti-stephine"". Ah, that neame kills me. I hate Lazy Town and always will. The songs and dances are corney. The characters are corney, and the acting is corney."
2,Cheaply made. Not worth the price.,This film was cheaply made using Apple's movie software. It is not easy to recognize what parts of the film to use. It only seems to outline from Wright's _Black Boy_. It does not provide any new information.
3,Worth having but..,If one were to choose between this Vol. and the Elite books on the same subject then Elite should be your choice. Too much material is crammed into this book resulting in merely glossing over the subject. Color plates are adequate and nothing special.
5,Destined to Charm,"Destined is an amazing contemporary adventure colored with magic and sprinkled with irish folklore. Ms. Madigan has a wonderful eye for detail and creates believable magical worlds in the here-and-now. Into all this, she tosses great dialogue, hot sex, and a hero to die for. If you like men with rowdy red hair, incredible sex appeal, and GREAT comebacks, try Destined by Dawn Madigan"
1,"not impressed, won't even cut through one layer of parchment paper.","This is the biggest waste of money. I was hoping to cut through 3 layers of melted together wax paper for a project I am doing. I was shocked to find that this piece of garbage won't even cut a clean circle through one piece of regular lined paper or parchment paper. It just squishes the paper and cuts 3/4 of the circle and then rips the rest of the page trying to get it out. It jams ever second cut and broke before I even got it out of the package (the flimsy plastic handle). This is a piece of JUNK don't waste your money. Will be contacting their customer service reps, nice lifetime warranty."
1,"Really? $6.97, I bought it for $1 at the local family dollar","I had thought to get this for my next trip. I did find it at the local family dollar for $1 plus local tax. No matter how much your local tax is, it isn't $5.97 on a $1 item. You can find these all over the place. Don't buy it here, buy it local."
2,Doesn't deliver what it was desiged for,"I bought one based on the praises here. However, when I received the product, the rubber doesn't lay flat, one part is a bit rippled. This causes the water to leak down the drain hole, thus defeats the purpose of having a drain stopper. It was supposed to stop the water from leaking down the drain, right? In my case, the product does not deliver."
4,works well,"You can't beat the price, and it works well, stops the water and is easy to clean. We soak it in bleach water after awhile to keep it clean. Our last one lasted for years."
3,The good part is at the end,"Skim the introduction. Page through the many biographical sketches, most of which seem to be mainly gee-whiz material detailing the great accomplishments of each prodigy at early ages, but providing few insights into what, really, makes them tick. Turn to the back.The essay by Bejun Mehta, discussing his own development, gives us precisely what's missing from so much of the literature on musically-gifted children: a first-person account by a prodigy, that goes beyond the surface and explains, clearly and simply, what it's like to be one. Read it. Show it to your friends."
4,maybe Heavy-Duty (?),"Buyer beware! The description at Amazon says ""Heavy-Duty"". However, the package from Rubbermaid does not say Heavy-Duty, and the gloves feel like they are made of normal thickness material.Review update after 3 months use: They are holding up well and I now plan to order 2 more pair. Changing my review from 1 star to 4."
5,Out of Print Book,"I was so fortunate to be able to find a copy of this definitive book about Wagner. It arrived ahead of schedule and looks like it is brand new, I will certainly do business with this seller again. Amazon always finds reliable partners!"
3,PC connection issue rears it's ugly head,"I've had this camera for 2 years now and for the price it has done alright. Recently though, just as someone had mentioned in an earlier review, it stopped connecting to my PC via the firewire. I plugged in a friends JVC and it worked fine, so I know it's not the computer or the cable. Its past warranty obviously... I don't think I'll pay to have it fixed. I just wish this would have lasted longer. Time for a better one - this time made in America !"
3,Not as good as it should be,"Pros: Really good zoom (sorta)Cons: When you zoom in, it looses pixels; No extra features; can't connect to PC or MAC without buying the driver from panasonicOverall - wish i hadn't bought it! Over priced!"
1,more hot air than hot sex,"This book is too much classificatory with Victoria being a pedant, demonstrating her use of high level vocabulary. Very boring format. I do agree that she is a sexy sexpert for sure."
4,"nice product, but strange size","The products (I ordered 2) arrived on the last day of the range of days given for delivery. I was just glad to have it in time to give for a gift. We set about putting the corks in together - both trivets were in good shape and exactly the same size. The problem is that the corks do not fit as they look in the picture. We will have to cut corks in half horizontally so that there isn't a big gap on one side of the trivit. It's hard to explain, it's just turning out to be a little more difficult than I thought it would be and won't look as ""clean"" as the picture, but all in all, I'm excited."
3,More Telling than Action,"The Joe Gunther mysteries is one of my favorite series when it comes to police procedural books. This novel, in particular, was not my favorite. I think the author was engrossed in telling us what he had researched and in working with the Montreal police and not in giving an action novel as he usually does. I like the way Mayor describes the scenery and towns and actions. A person can see where the characters are and have a sense of the places. I will definitely read another Joe Gunther book."
5,Good read,"Thank you Archer Mayor for the Joe Gunther Series, I love this character and the others that continue in the series."
2,Disappointing.,"Have enjoyed the series, until now. This book was not good - Gunther's hometown Brattleboro finds itself in the middle of an Asian gang takeover. The close knit community will not talk to the police and any ability to stop the violence seems remote. Some inquiries to other departments finds an increase in Asian gang activity across the state.Joe and Les Spinney (from a previous book) become US Marshalls forming a task force of federal, state and local jurisdictions. But the book doesn't work - on any level. The writing is frustratingly dull, the characters are hard to keep track of and no one would care about them. The story is just not interesting.I finished the book because I find the series interesting and did not want to miss any bridge material to the next installment. If the series continues this way, I will not continue."
3,HDTV/Flat Screen Issue,"I'm a huge Buffy & Angel fan, but for those of you with HDTV's or flat screen's, be warned. The picture quality of the DVDs are pretty bad. First, you definitely need to view the episodes in the 4:3 format; 16:9 isn't an option because it looks awful. Even in the 4:3 format, some scenes are fuzzy. Like I said, I'm a huge fan of the series, but watching the DVDs isn't as enjoyable due to the picture quality."
1,Equally as bad as Kim Possible.,"I hate this show, and I can't believe it has gotten so many five star reviews. These must be abused children who all have brain damage living in the same house or something and kill vampires and demons. Leave that for GOOD hero shows. Buffy is just a teen wh*re who is put in the shoes of a superhero and does it horribly. Every character on this show is sarcastic and annoying and they're all the same, plus they all fight the same corny way, even the mindless zombies in that one episode. Anyone who likes this pathetic show should be slain."
3,"A Buffy Beginning: The First, But the Best is Yet to Come","I have this Dvd and yes, I think it's really good. But...it's not the best season. In this season they are really introducing you to Buffy. Coming out that she's the Slayer in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" where they let some of her frends find out. The first season lets you know from the start she doesn't just fight vampires, but there are witch's, demons, etc. that it also revolves around. It also shows that this show is like no other. It's not all about fighting and destroying evil. It's about her as a teen. She's growing up too. Dealing with crushs, friends, tests, and parents are part of her life too, just like ours. This season is great but if you really want to step into Buffy and love it, get the Complete Second Season. There is a lot of stuff there that is just great and you will discover that too."
2,Is this as good as it gets?,"Being very late to the DVD game, I wanted to be choosy about my first purchases. I wanted to repay the ""Buffy"" crew for years of great TV, and made Season One my first DVD(s).The show was broadcast on a grainy UHF station, and I thought I would be thrilled by the qualiity picture. Well, I was stunned alright.I now miss that grainy picture I was used to. At least the ""fuzz"" moves with the characters. On this DVD it just lingers there, distracting me, slightly, from the action.And the shadows are a little cartoonish looking.Unless I read very convincing reviews praising the picture quality of later seasons' DVD's, I'll wait a few years to buy any more of this series, when digital transfer technology has improved. I assume ""Angel"" DVD's will be similar.From now on, I'll only read professional reviews, like Sound & Vision magazine."
4,"Teenage Girl, High School Student, Vampire Slayer","Buffy Summers is a teenager reeling from her reecent expulsion from her L.A. High School. She wants to start over with a new life at her new school in Sunnydale, California. However, she quickly falls into her old ways as a Vampire Slayer. One girl in all the world, chosen to fight demons, vampires, and the forces of darkness. With an ensemble, and relatively undiscovered cast, including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Brendan, Allyson Hannigan, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, and Anthony Stewart Head. The first season of the critically acclaimed show includes the episodes:1. Welcome to the Hellmouth2. The Hrvest3. The Witch4. Teacher's Pet5. Neer Kill a Boy on the First Date6. The Pack7. Angel8. I Robot, You Jane9. Puppet Show10. Nightmares11. Out of Mind out of Sight12. Prophecy Girl"
5,Buffy the Vampire slayer - Rocks,"I am a die hard Buffy fan, loved the DVDs, got to watch them from the start to the final season, what a blast. All Buffy fans would want to owen all the DVDs, they are great"
5,Great way to catch up and understand,This DVD set is a great way to catch up. If you are like me and came in the middle of the season then this will really help you keep all the characters strait. I look forward to the complete second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in June and any other DVD sets.
5,Heaven!,"The sound! The clarity! After waiting so (excrutiatingly) long for the DVD set of Season 1 to come to the US, my patience has been rewarded, and I'm in absolute heaven. True (as another reviewer has commented), there are some spots that are grainier than we've come to expect from DVD quality, but nothing that is bothersome or would inhibit anyone's enjoyment of the episodes. Most people probably wouldn't even notice it. Also, Joss' commentaries for ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" are not to be missed. I only wish there were commentary for all of the episodes. I can't recommend the DVD set highly enough for any Buffy fan(atic). Can't wait for Season 2!"
4,Good Begining To A Great Series,"Buffy is the greatest televison series ever. Joss Whedon wanted to create an icon and a universe that existed in our minds, and he has succeded. The first season is a good introduction to the characters as a whole, but it only contains a few key episodes. ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" are the standouts. The set is weak on extra features. Also the poor packaging leads to discs floating around in the sleaves, causing scratches (Fox Video please take note and fix). Altogether, this is a must have far all Buffy fans."
2,Worst Buffy season,"If you're new to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, don't mind this season. It has a lot of unconnected and unnecessary monster-of-the-week episodes that you just want them to end. A lot of people think BtVS is a horrible show after watching this season. Only important episodes are, Welcome to the Hellmouth, The Harvest, Angel and Prophecy Girl. Also, Witch introduces the character Amy and I Robot... You Jane introduces Jenny so you need to watch them to. But know that, this series is a lot better than this. 5.5/10."
5,Late blooming buffy fan,"I just discovered how great the Buffy series is this past year. Having seen, and hated, the original movie, I decided the television series must be just another teen soap. That was until my husband came down with the flu, and we watched it in reruns while he recuperated. What a great series! The dvd has all kinds of interviews and extras, and it's kind of fun to hear insights into the characters, but the episodes are why we buy. The dialogue is incredible and the action is ""Butt-kicking"" (my son's phrase). There is a bit of teen soap, especially when dealing with Angel and Buffy's relationship, but it is well balanced with the monsters, action and comedy. I think the first season is the best, but the rest of the seasons are also great."
2,Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Season 1,"The TV show itself is amazing...and I was quite excited to buy the first season. Only to find out that ""Very Good"" quality actually means pretty beat up box set and that ""All three discs of season one"" means you will be getting disc two and two copies of disc three..meaning no disc one. Luckily I was refunded...and they were very courtesy and I received my money back very quickly."
3,So-so start.,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete First Season is a short season but the characters and storylines were less than impressive. Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting was too Valley Girl in the first season but I also think it was on purpose, the later seasons Buffy is much more compassionate and real. Season 2 and 3 are the best seasons. Buffy was a good show while it lasted, aww the memories!"
4,Uncommon Slices of American Pie,"Whether he's hobnobbing with country music's biggest stars, eavesdropping on a private conversation at a seedy Belizean motel, riding shotgun with a tell-it-like-it-is trucker, or delineating his own personal trials and tribulations, Michael Perry possesses the uncanny ability to transform everyday occurrences into uncommon slices of American pie. In Off Main Street, Perry waves his journalistic wand over rural America and metamorphoses the ordinary into the extraordinary. Portraying people who might very well be my neighbor or yours, Off Main Street beats with a small-town pulse that radiates with relatability.My only gripe with this book is that Perry tries too hard to wield his literary chops and, in so doing, distance himself (readability-wise) from those very same common folk from which he draws his inspiration."
5,American Life,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends OFF MAIN STREET, Michael Perry's (of POPULATION 485 fame) second treasury of Americana: equal parts about the people he meets, the places he sees, the history he's known & the adventures he went on with truckers, Rolling Thunder, into a prison, about Greyhound buses, on country music Sara Evans' tour, a talk about Elvis, a meeting with the legendary music man, Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, junk mail from the KKK, & much more.Open OFF MAIN STREET & the stories pour forth about the weird & the hardworking, the killers & the singers, & just plain all-American -- from his Wisconsin home town, his book tour, his writing assignments, & his wanderings.OFF MAIN STREET is a duffle bag of pungent tales, very well written, & a great gift for your homesick friends."
4,Excellent book with very poor quality binding.,"I'm a Bible school student and had this text as one of two for a Bible Study Teaching Methods class. The book is an excellent resource for learning some basic methods of Bible study you can do on your own and then teach others to do as well.The only complaint I have about this book is the binding (hence the 4 stars). It is so poor that the spine cracked and pages were falling out before I finished reading the 2nd chapter. I'm going to contact the publisher and see if they will send me another book. Until then, I'll have to use lots of tape to keep the pages in place!Other than this, the book is excellent and would be a great addition to any Christian's library, but especially if you are a teacher of the Bible."
2,Too Pricey In Comparison,"I ordered this item from Amazon and then found it for nearly half the price through another vendor. If you're thinking about purchasing this particular wine bar, research your prices in wine accesory catalogs beforehand. This is certainly not the best deal out there."
3,Book Helpful - Map almost USELESS!,"I found most of the info helpful, but felt the section on luaus should have at least suggested two others, instead of just the Old Lahaina Luau, which I feel has become too much of a production, instead of a beautiful feast to share! I have been to Maui 6 times, and everytime have found several new & surprising sights, sounds, meals, & wonderful, helpful people. The map should have more detailed street info, especially around Kihei & Lahaina. Might help prevent accidents. I found the Paradise Family Guide on Maui & Lanai by Dona Early & Christie Stilson much more informative and realistic, especially re: to $$ and cents!"
3,Good product - ridiculous price,"Not as good as the very high end engery drinks, but when you buy it at Target for about $1.20 each (in the 12 pack), its a suitable on the run protien drink. That and a cliff bar gives you 27 grams of protien -and way to many carbs and grams of fat unfortunately.I'm not sure who has to actually buy this stuff at $3 per bottle from Amazon/Nestle, but I do feel bad for them.Amazon - make this $1.50 - $1.75 each and the convenience factor might drive me to buy it here.If you want a truely healthy protien shake at about $2 per unit, do a search on 20/20 (pro club). Fibre, Protien, low carbs, low fat, vitamins, etc."
3,"Warmer than plain LED, but still a slightly dingy color cast","On balance, I'm glad to change out the old incandescent bulbs for LEDs: less wasteful, tougher, cooler. But even the 'warm light' version still has that slightly greeny-grey cast - it's especially noticeable when you can see the bright lively light of ordinary bulbs in the same room. I'm hoping that the manufacturers still think it's worth trying to get closer to the look of incandescents. I'll certainly swap these for a brand that does."
4,Good add on for IPOD,Am satisfied with product. Only problem is that the detachable belt clip broke. I'm not sure if it was a defect or my fault. In any case the company is sending me a free replacement clip.AMAZON offered the best overall price (taking no tax and free shipping into account).
2,Craptastical Features,"Well, the skin it's self fits my 60GB iPod Photo with some maneuvering but will likely never come off without some plastic surgery! I like how it appears to be durable. You cannot use the wheel while the cover is on, you have to flip the thick plastic cover down in order to use the wheel. It's not secured very well and I constaltly find it loose in my backpack off of the skin. The screen cover is the same thick hard plastic so be sure to not get anything under it or there will be some major scratches on your screen. Cannot use the docking station with the skin on and there isn't a way to fold the bottom of the skin away so that I can. Overall I like the skin it's self but the plastic cover for the wheel is annoying and the one for the screen seems cheap and there is no protection from the plastic it's self scratching your screen."
1,st helens 30 anniversary adition,i bought st helens 30th anniv.dvd an did not like how they put this dvd thepicture is not clear it is not in widescreen it should be on blueray why do movie componies do this to good movies hope they put st.helens on blueray in widescreen do it right next time. dont buy st helens keep your money wait for blureay.
2,"works, but not as expected.","I purchased this to replace the trailing arm bushings on 1998 CR-V. The video on you tube said 15 minutes. It was more like 4 hours. What they don't tell you is the pusher is not long enough to the cr-v, so I had to make a make shift extra spacer to finish the job. The first side I made the mistake of removing the tool before inserting the extra spacer and putting in the new bushing. This tool will bend your trailing arm enough that the tool will not go on the same trailing arm bushing very easily at all. Once knowing this it went better on the other side. It did still save time over taking the whole thing off, despite having to remove a top control arm that was not indicated in any instructions."
5,Great seat for kids as they grow,"My son is a big 3-1/2 year old...this seat is enough of a low profile (especially compared to the Britax we have in our bigger car) that he can still get in and get comfortable in our small sedan when he sits behind me. He loves wearing the grown-up seatbelt and being able to undo it when we're getting out of the car when he's allowed. The seat is lightweight, comfortable, and affordable. A definite must-buy!"
1,Disappointment,"The Beginner's Guide provides a very simplistic, rudimentaryintroduction to stock options in the first third of this book, whilethe remaining two thirds is mostly the author's promotion of their web site. In this part of the book, proprietary indicators are introduced for stock chart reading. However, to get the complete significance of these proprietary indicators, one must pay a fee for access to the member's section of the author's web site. This is a very expensive ""guide"" compared to other books. Buyer beware, you have be informed. In my opinion, this book is a big disappointment, or more cynically, nothing more than a promotion (that you pay for) for the author's web site."
5,Very Helpful,"As a beginning options trader, this book helped clarify alot of the mysteries and eliminate alot of fears associated with options. With the help of the book's examples and clear explanations, I have been successfully choosing options that make me money. The web site has also greatly helped because of all the additional tools found in one internet location. The Beginner's Guide was a great find by itself, but the web site definitely has added benefit. A great book for beginning investors."
5,Heartwarming story with beautiful artwork,"This is a very charming holiday story piggybacking on the Santa Claus myth. Artwork is very colorful, and both the story line and the artwork will keep a child's attention."
5,This book was so good it gave me chills,"A moving (fictional)life history of the two most importantpeople in the known galaxy, and their war with each otherContains great leadership ideas. I'm going to recomend thisbook be placed on the US Marine Corps reading listJason C. WaughSgt USMCp.s. if you read only one chapter, read capter 11, it gaveme chills"
3,taking time to grow on me,"I got this cd recently and it's taking a little time to grow on me, much like 'Til Tuesday did. I like the two hit singles and had a quick listen to the cd in the shop and thought it sounded good, full bodied and a bit on the sad/pensive side like I like. I found upon listening it through though that it has, scattered throughout, dated, cheesy synths, like 'Til Tuesday (which I now enjoy after getting used to the sound). I'll liken their sound to the slower, sadder side of the Cars, and quite 80's city-ish, which may have been serious then, but sounds a bit funny now to modern ears. It's however a nice, mild chunk of music that keeps a similar feel throughout, except one track which is a bit annoying. It's not very stand out-ish, or attention grabbing, but it doesn't have to be."
3,The title said it all.,"The title states all that you need to know. There are a few really good 80's hits that we remember, but the rest sound pretty much the same."
3,"Great comedy, but.....","One of the best comedies on TV. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it is going to the GOD/Jesus jokes a little to soon. How is it that there are many religon's out there, but they only make fun of the Christians? It really bothers me! Stay away from GOD/Jesus there has to be more in this world to make fun of or joke around with.Also, be very carefull this is the same guy who makes Family Guy and sells in Volumes NOT seasons. Look on Amazon and you will see you are not getting all the episodes!"
1,how long will it work?,"The product worked somewhat as advertised at first but work rarely now. I charged the light as intructed and mounted. I had problems with the testing but it seemed to work so I left it now I don't think I can do anything except trash it. The warranty is 30 days from the manufacturer. I'm waiting to hear from them but don't expect much... I would not buy this. I also agree the light is pretty dim, but if in a dark secluded area it would be OK, only if it worked....."
3,Too Accademic,"I was looking for a leisurely read of Celtic mythology. Instead this book is really more of an academic discourse. I think Sjoestedt spends too much time talking about all the possibilities and ambiguities in our knowledge of Celtic mythology, which is great for an academic book, but terribly dull for a leisurely read :/"
5,worth every penny,"This show is incredible. I am a huge Sean Bean fan which I why I started watching this series. This season blew me out of the water. From the acting to the directing to the lanscape and costumes, this show nails it. This collector's edition version makes owning this truly monumental."
3,Wonky discs?,I don't know whats up with these discs.... I ordered it and it takes them a long long long time to play. I tested them on other players and its not just my player.. Returned and asked for new discs and they have the same problems.
5,A Great Story,This was a fast-paced story and I enjoyed it very much. It was hard to watch only one episode at a time as I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The quality of the blu-ray was excellent.
5,I love this show!,"Although I am not that big of a fan of medieval type of films or tv shows, I simply fell in love with this series. The first episode was ok, and was a bit too complex for me at first. A few days later, I gave it another try, and I couldn't stop watching after that. I really got involved with the characters, especially, and the story as well. It's like a roller coaster ride, it plays so well with your emotions.This is not your conventional TV show where you kinda know what is going to happen next. This show keeps you on your toes, and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Also the attention to the detail of the costumes, scenery, and even plot really makes this show into something special.If I could recommend any show in the world, I would recommend anyone to watch this."
1,An adolescent's wet dream.,"I watched the first 3 episodes of season 1, looking forward to finding a new, quality series to become engrossed in. I loved Lord of the Rings as well as other good fantasy and science fiction. I just could find nothing about this series worth watching. It's a bunch of dysfunctional royal families, with stereotypical overbearing kings, conniving queens and evil princes, vying for power and willing to do anything to get it. I see no love, no compassion, no spirituality whatsoever; darkness after darkness upon darkness is just plain boring and unimaginative. I also found the sexuality to be totally and completely presented from an adolescent male's perspective; again, boring and unimaginative (not to mention demeaning and objectifying toward women)."
4,nothing wrong with the DVD,"The Box was a messand falling apart, but it did not effect the DVD. I am in the process of viewing.I was happy overall."
5,Amazing,"Amazing amazing amazingA great show worth watching. I guess my patience has paid off. Did I mention that this show is amazing?I am not going to write a lengthy review, seeing that there is already a 1000 reviews for Game of Thrones.I definitely recommend this series. I loved Lord of the Rings a lot of and it kind of reminds me of LOTR.Yes, there are a lot of characters and it may be hard to follow but do not let that discourage you. Re watch the episodes again or have discussions with your friends or some people that have read or are reading the novel and that will definitely help shed some insight if you are feeling confused and over whelmed with the many characters.10/10.Series exceeded my expectations!"
2,Not worth the hype,"I kept hearing about this show and the hype behind it. I saw the trailer and it looked good.I purchased the season and after watching 5 episodes I was left wondering who is behind the hype? I kept falling asleep during the episodes. The main story is ""okay"" but each episode there is always a scene of a ""wise person"" telling the kids some story about... I have no clue what the heck the 10min stories were about, I kept falling asleep, lol.Seems like this show is for kids 18+ (twilight with gore scenes). If you liked the latest twilight ""pregnant"" movie, then you will love this show. But if you were bored out of your mind watching mr./mrs. Pregnant chit chat, then I would skip this show."
1,Unintelligent and Dishonest,Like to root for the underdog? Like to root for the good guy? Well allow me to save you the trouble- the good guy and the underdog loses every single time. Evil prevails- constantly and unrealistically. If that's the kind of stuff your into go for it. The choices the characters make are so unrealistic and stupid it's hard to feel sympathy for them. Eddard for example tells something to his enemy prior to the King and knowingly waits until the King (his strongest ally) is dead to do anything about it. Very frustrating to watch- don't waste your time.
3,"Good series, but missing scenes?","I have seen the series as it aired on HBO, and watched it 3 times (going on the 4th with the DVD release) on TIVO. I am not arguing the series is bad or full of filth or the like, I mean the books were more descriptive then the show was.However, I am disappointed it seems that some scenes were removed from the DVD release. Now granted this could be due to me remembering when things happened, but one example, the assassin at Winterfell, I could have sworn that happen in episode 2 but I didn't see it on the DVD release."
3,Disappointed,I was so excited to receive this in the mail yesterday but once my husband and I started to watch the second disc it started skipping about 25 minutes into episode 3. After trying to clean our blu-ray player and trying to play it in our PS3 we discovered there was a small crack in the disc. It seems to be a manufacturing defect not damaged in shipping and the packaging was very sturdy. After inspecting the rest of the discs we found that disc 4 and 5 also had the same defect. We will be returning to Amazon and hoping the next set we receive does not have this problem. If not for this problem we would rate this a 5 out of 5.
5,Bought as a gift for someone,Bought this for my father for his birthday and didn't realize it was a downloadable series. Thought it was the actual DVDs I could gift him. No biggie I was able to have him log in and watch it on his computer when he was away from home or his DVD player.
5,Ridiculous,"Everything about this show is superb. Acting, special effects, plot, cinematography. This may be one of the greatest TV dramas of all time."
4,Very good!,I read all of the books that are quite extensive. The series does a good job of summarizing the story in the writings.
2,Great show if they would take out the pornography!,"HBO does it again! They have created a terrific story and then ruined it with pornography. This time they even included naked children and a 10 year old (don't know the exact age) nursing (with her complete breast exposed).Just like they ruined Tudors, the same can be said of this series as well (even more so!).HBO WAKE UP!!!!"
3,Faulty Product,"I love Game of Thrones, and I was really excited to purchase it, but I was sad when the first disk didn't read on my computer. I had to figure out some other way to watch the first two episodes. The rest worked fine, but I wish the manufacturers had checked before distributing the DVDs."
4,Love the TV show,"The quality of this series is clear. I think the box and cover were a little much but that's me. Overall, its pretty good. 8/10"
1,Classic first season mistake,Never kill off the actor that is the only reason people watch the show in the first place in the first season. Same reason Jericho and countless others were canceled. Stupid decision.
3,Good,"This is a decent series, but it does not do the books justice. I watched it because I loved the books and heard so many rave reviews about the series. As usual, the books were way better, but the series is enjoyable none the less"
2,"Review: Game Of Thrones, First Season",I purchased this DVD based on the highly favorable reviews. I wish I could be as favorable in my review. The story is very slow moving and drawn out to the point of near boredom. The sound quality is poor with the many low volume personal conversations requiring higher volume to be understood which yields uncomfortable level for most scenes. The all very British language is often difficult to understand.
3,I'm 50/50 on it.,"I think it got better in the season finale. Definitely will keep your attention. It looks like it will get a little more ""Dungeons and Dragons"" type in season 2."
4,Pretty good,I read the first book before I watched the first season. I will say that I was glad to watch because the books can become very overwhelming and full of sooooo much information. It was nice to see it on screen to fill in some of the gaps!
2,Good content bad physical media,"I, like others, have had issues with the media not working properly. I have the DVD release and have now had episode 7 on disc 4 about 10 minutes from the end episode cause all 4 different DVD players to skip over part of the episode. I even got a replacement disk and EXACTLY the same issue occurred. HBO should stop wasting so much money on packaging and make a product that actually works."
5,Great Series - Blu-ray Quality is Amazing!,This series is only made better by the high audio and video quality of blu-ray. If you enjoyed the series on TV then this is a must buy. Highly recommended!
1,Would be great if I could watch it...,"As many others have stated, this review does not reflect the series but rather the media it comes on. I was able to watch the first three episodes before the discs stopped loading on any of my bluray players. I updated the software on each (Sony, Denon, computer) to no avail.Just printed the return label...I understand this is an ongoing problem with many Bluray discs-- the anti-piracy coding prevents them from playing at all. Way to go Sony..."
5,Amazing,"Absolutely incredible story, loved the books and the tv series did not disappoint! Would recommend this series to anyone, having read the books or not!"
1,This is a porn flick!,"Thirty years ago this would have been sold as a porn movie. I watched the entire series. Wow, what a mistake it was buying this PORN FLICK. Had I know I never would have bought it. There are 20 to 25 porn scenes in season one. Yes, frontal nude shots of men and woman. Yes, numerous copulation scenes. Fornication, prostirution, men with men in an intimate scene. Woman with woman. Discusions of adults with children. Good lord, why is this not rated X. Had I known it was a porn flick I would not have bought it."
1,It would have been so nice....,"...if I actually could have watched this series! Unfortunately it was impossible as the completely idiotic programming of the disks prevented any attempts to get them to work! The first disk briefly came to life after waiting for some 10 minutes, since then even that disk doesn't load anymore. I have a multi-region player with up-to-date firmware which so far was able to cope with all other disks I have!Even my new laptop gave up, so back the DVD's go!"
1,Poorly Made Product,"Theses blu ray discs will not play, and they freeze my blu ray player. I returned to Amazon and received a replacement. The result was the same. I will be returning this yet again for a refund. Disappointed because I was looking forward to watching this show in hi def. Yes, my player is new, and updated to latest firmware."
3,Does not work well in Toshiba Blu-ray Player BDX1200,"The Blu-ray discs take about one minute to load after inserting them in my Toshiba BDX1200KU Blu-ray player. During this time, nothing is displayed on screen and the Blu-ray player takes no input other than EJECT or STOP. This made me think the discs would not play at all, and my Blu-ray player does not have any firmware upgrades, so that was a discouraging experience. I was lucky to have just left the discs in for a while, trying to press any button other than EJECT or STOP, when I discovered that waiting a full minute was all I needed to do to get the discs to play. This is a significant inconvenience, but I am happy I can view the content now, at least. I give this Blu-ray set 3 out of 5 for the inconvenience and initial frustration.Supplemental info: They will not play at all in my computer's Blu-ray drive, an LG BH10LS30, even after the latest manufacturer firmware update."
2,Boring & pointless with no real story content,Boring story to watch unless you just want to see endless breasts and overly violent gore. Both of which would not be so bad if the story was really interesting. I found it hard to stay awake after the first 20 minutes.
1,Unnecessary nudity and violence.,"While the pilot was mildly interesting, it felt like it was written by comic book guy from the Simpsons. The women were disposable and the men had all the fun. My advice? Pick up any novel ny Phillip K. dick or go watch venture bros. Your I.Q. Won't suffer for it."
1,KEEPS FREEZING,"On 2nd set of BD and they just won't play. Amazon was great with sending a replacement but the new set is just like the 1st, it doesn't work. My Blu Ray player works fine with all of my other movies, but I can't get past 25 min. on the 1st disk of this series without it freezing, jeking and then totally stopping. I've updated my player, reconnected it all and now I think it's just the coding in the Game of Thrones."
5,GAME OF THRONES SEASON 1,Wonderful can not wait until season 2 arrives. Our son sent this to us knowing we would like this it is on the same line as Lord of the Rings.
1,Too graphic,"I read the game of thrones book and really loved it. However there is way too much nudity in the HBO series for me to watch it in good conscience. There was even more nudity than was described in the book! Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to watching this series.... The nudity is not just from the back either. I watched one episode and that was enough. :( In my opinion, Game of Thrones is not appropriate for Christian viewers or people who hold to old-fashioned notions of propriety! Wish they could release a version minus the nudity!"
2,Why all of the gay scenes?,"~~~ W A R N I N G ~~~ If you find gay sex scenes repulsive and unnatural, do not watch this series unless you are prepared to fast forward through several scenes. The books do not have these scenes so if you are a fan of the books, you may not like the changes."
5,Incredibly intriguing!,"Once you begin watching, you'll be hooked and before you know it...you're staying up way too late to watch ""just one more to see what happens"" - love it! I recommend ordering some coffee, you'll need it for the next morning before you start your day - but it'll be worth it, get through the day.... Gotta get back to the tv to watch another episode!! Enjoy!"
3,Unbreakable if the water isn't too hot,"Mine is actually starting to melt a little. The bottom is getting little bubbles. It's leaning to one side as the base slowly caves in. Still, I think it will last as long as any glass press I've ever owned, the price is good, and for an office coffee press where the hot water on the water cooler (not a kettle right off the flame) is the hottest water it will be exposed to it's perfect."
3,Buyer Beware!,"The press is great and if you are person who drops dishes while washing them or is clumsy, you will want to get this press due to it's ""unbreakable"" nature.However, if you use the press on a daily basis with really hot water, it will develop cracks in the bottom and begin to leak. I guess based on the review written back in August of 2004, Bodum got flooded with requests for replacements. Now they have changed their policy and they do not warrant the beaker against cracks, nor do they replace it for free. The website does not even sell the polycarbonate ""unbreakable"" beaker and when I called the NY store, they said they only had one left in stock. I had to pay an additional $11 to get the new beaker (although they did wave the shipping cost).If you're going to use the press everyday, or with very hot water, you may as well get the glass and just be careful. Otherwise be prepared to buy a whole new press (which at this price isn't so bad but certainly a pain)."
1,Agrees with Buyer Beware warning,"I had the same experience as an earlier reviewer in that the press cracked and leaked. We asked Bodum for a replacement to this ""unbreakable"" coffee press, but they declined stating that the term ""unbreakable"" is meant as a marketing gimmic, and that we weren't meant to think the beaker would not break even under normal use. We never dropped the press. Also, the plunger itself was difficult to press, especially compared with other Bodum models and different brands."
5,The best of the best,"I use this press everyday, and have had no problems at all. The only way that someone could damage their press is to:use metal objects (like spoons) to steer the mixUse water that is too hot (I have a $10 coffee maker that's used for tea, but I also use the hot water from it).Some people put theirs in the microwave. Not a good idea...true you can do it, but it does cause long term damage.I've been using the same press for over 2 years, it's only now that I need to buy a new one because I want one for work."
3,May be unbreakable but it is crackable.,"After extensive use, but no boiling water, a series of cracks in the shape of a star has formed on the base, through which seeps enough coffee to form a puddle and to irritate me. So I have just ordered the Pinzon to give the competition a try."
4,Great,Ok I used this thing for a year on and off and it works fine. I don't know what you people are talking about. Just be careful with the thing and don't break it. I never wash it in the dishwasher so maybe that's what cracks it? Take care of it and it will take care of you.I live to serve my master and his name is Coffee.--Certified Coffee Addict
4,Perfect for my needs,The coffee sucks where I work. It's free but I just can't stand it. I stayed at a hotel that used the French press and it came to me I could use one at work. I didn't want to buy an electric coffee maker and have it at my cube and break some sort of safety code or something. Now I drink my choice of coffee every morning and it only takes my around 5 minutes to make it.I see other reviews saying the thing broke on them. Spend another $12.
2,nothing exciting.........,"Well, one third of the book was written about his childhood, his junior life experience in high school and university which are .... nothing but common growing up experience to every one. Writing style is nothing exciting to write about.... 2 stars..."
4,Worth a close look,"I've owned the 18 volt Dewalt circular saw for 5 years now. It's been a workhorse and seems to have plenty of life left in it. Cordless convenience, no need for AC nearby, etc., etc. - it's addicting if you build much at all. But the 24 volt saw is a huge step up. I got a chance to play with one at a manufacturor's demo show. The 24 volt model is a huge improvement over the 18 volt. This baby goes through dimensional lumber with ease. Blade pinch doesn't bother it nearly as much as it does the 18 volt model. The 6 extra volts is probably part of the advantage, but I bet the extra cutting teeth matter even more. This is an expensive tool, so if you're not going to use it fairly often, say once or twice a month, you might want to stick with an AC saw. Batteries for these tools seem to survive better with regular use."
5,Melissa and Doug Wooden Puzzle,This was bought for my granddaughter. She loves sea creatures and the chunky pieces makes it easy for her to use her imagination outside the puzzle board. They make wonderful children's toys!!
2,Not As Pictured & Poor Quality,"Although Amazon shipped this much quicker than I expected, it is not what was pictured nor what Melissa & Doug used to sale. I have a number of Melissa & Doug puzzles that are painted on ALL sides. The older puzzles are made of real wood and feel much nicer than this pressed board crap. They are also cut to the image where the newer puzzles are mere outlines, haphazardly thrown together. I would have promptly returned this puzzle, but my 19 month old son really loves puzzles and saw this and the other 2 puzzles as they were coming out of the box. I cannot believe that these cost the same amount or more than the other puzzles we own, yet they are of such an inferior quality that I cannot believe the are trying to pawn it off as the same thing they used to sale. Shame on you Melissa & Doug."
1,Have not received product!,I ordered this product in early October and received a notice about ten days later that it was delayed but have heard nothing since and it is now late November.
5,The man who listens to horses,I found this book very useful. It agrees with everything that I felt anyway as I wanted the horse to do it because it had a choice not because it did not. I feel that to get the best from your horse this has to come from trust and respect.I am new to training horses but having two green yearlings a colt and a filly I tried this out and have found them to be a lot calmer and a lot less stressed. Trying to do this in a field was not as easy as trying to do this in a round pen as there is to many distractions. But I feel I have much more of a bond with them and understand them better.I am really pleased that I read this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves horses rather than wanting to control them by force.
4,A very entertaining and inspiring life story,"I don't raise horses but have always loved these animals. This book was a gift from a friend who knew I had read ""The Horse Whisperer"" and she thought this book might interest me. As I read this book, I became to admire this man for his courage and tenacity; he did it his way and it worked! If you raise horses, this is a great book - a gentle way to ""break"" your horses is discussed."
4,The Man Who Listens To Horses,"Monty Roberts' story, as told in this book, is a challenging examination of some of the values of our society. Racism, child abuse, domestic violence, mistreatment of animals, perception of mental health conditions are just some of the issues we are given an opportunity to ponder. A great insight into the world of the horse and a frank look at the underbelly of our own."
4,"Peaceful, enjoyable reading","A wonderful book about horses, horse training, human relations, the nature of a soul, kindness & more. Its the real-life story of Month Roberts, a horse whisperer, or communicator who had mastered the art of inter-species communication - with horses. His voice gently guides the listener through his life experiences some of which were quite brutal. But this gently man's personal life journey will leave with a feeling of wonder."
1,"Tedious, egocentric, major disappointment!","Bought this book with enthusiasm, but quickly found myself forcing myself to keep reading it because it was tedious, dry, and incredibly self-serving and egocentric. Would never recommend it to a friend, and would never read another one of his books based on my experience with this book."
1,"Is killing a tame bear ""Something to be proud of""?","Although I previously loved their music, I will boycott it from now on. For those of you not in the know, I'm referring to the 2007 conviction of Troy Gentry for killing a tame bear in a cage. Please don't buy their music!"
5,Montgomery Gentry something to be proud of,I bought Montgomery Gentry greatest hits after being told about them from friends in USA and hearing a couple of tracksThis CD was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be and now a valued item of my collection
4,entertaining,"My 2 month old son really likes the bumper. He looks at the images with interest and sometimes smiles and ""talks"" when he sees them. I also use the diaper stacker, the quilt and the sheet. The images on the sheet look good but are too small to be attractive to the baby at this point. I could live without the dust ruffle and I'm not using the valance. I did buy the mobile from this collection and am happy with it. Overall, this product is entertaining, useful and survives the machine wash well. However, it is expensive - the price also seems to have gone up from when I bought it. I wish I was able to buy each item in the package separately. Also, I wish the material composition and the sizes of the bedding were listed on the site. Luckily, everything fit our crib. The fitted sheet is all cotton. The quilt is a cotton blend (feels ok). Anyway, I'm satisfied and wouldn't trade the sea-life images for another pattern."
1,this is not toledo,all i wanted to comment on was the fact that the creators of this film seemed to do absolutly no visiting of toledo. whereever it was that they shot this movie looks nothing like toledo and nothing referenced or shown in the film is in toledo not even the skyline shown in the film. i mean couldnt they just shoot the film in toledo for crying outloud or atleast try to learn about the city before trying to represent it on film. the movie itself was horrible too but with a great cast. i just was so upset as a toledo filmmaker myself that they would disrespect my city so much by ignoring it and using the name in its film.
1,Mouth-Breathing,"Now THIS is a real stinker of a movie. Everyone involved in this mess should be ashamed of themselves. And where did they find this cast? I've never seen such a pitiful collection of mouth-breathers assembled in one movie before. Poor Christopher Walken. Hopefully, this was a lucrative payday for this has-been. What a waste of talent!One last comment.....is it just me or, does the female romantic lead (I believe her name is Christine Taylor) have the ugliest hands in show business? UGH!...she should wear gloves."
3,Angel,The idea of the book is great but the pictures of the grandparents are more like great-grandparents. I don't even know any grandparents with grey fixed hair. The concept is great but the pictures need to be updated.
2,Not so much,"My daughter nor my husband liked this book. I thought the pictures were pretty, but that doesn't do any good if my daughter doesn't like it."
2,no text,"This book has no text, which may be okay for older kids who can put words to the pictures, but not for my 2 year old son."
2,A slow start,"This was a very slow and disappointing start, to what I was hoping would be a good trilogy. The only thing that kept me going was hoping that all the setup would eventually end the the later books might better. The only reason I was interested in that is because of my love for the story of the elves of Krynn.The writing in this book was subpar. The characters were shallow and the points of view that kept shifting from one paragraph to the next was diconcerting. Even the well established characters such as Gilthas and Kerianseray did not absorb me as they have in previous books. Not to mention the nomads and khurs, who were abominably boring.The ending started to pick up some pace but since I never really cared for most of the characters I felt it was too little to late. However, I'll keep reading because I want to see what happens to the elves of Krynn."
4,Good book!,I am currently reading the second in this trilogy which is even better but this was certainly a good beginning with characters that were well developed.
4,good story,"I liked this story of the Elves and their search for a new homeland. the story was engrossing and I truely felt for their plight. Can't wait until the next one comes out. May not be the best out there but is definitely worth reading.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
4,I wonder what Grace made of this?,"This book is like a real-life version of Moby Dick, minus the white whale. Mr Murphy seems torn between wanting to protect his new bride (Grace) from the gorier aspects of the voyage and providing the reader with an objective record.The book is best at the beginning when everything is new and exciting. Towards the end there are more lists and I began to skip pages. It was worth reading though, and proof, were it needed, that whaling is a gruesome activity which we would be better off without."
1,Content may be fine but it's poorly written and hard to read,"I've just started reading this book for a university course and though I've only finished one chapter, I have to say that the writing is so poor that I would not recommend this book to anyone. I find myself continually having to re-read sentences because they are oddly worded. The omission of serial commas and the lack of semicolons in many lists containing the word ""and"" merely add to the confusion. There are many HCI books out there, so save yourself a headache and find one that's well written."
4,awsome!!!,"I've met Kingsta before.I'm not kiding.I've met him before because my friends dad works for him.This guy is great.If u have'nt heared his music,then you need to listen to it.It is awsome!"
5,dessert glass,"I run a bed and breakfast and wanted a dish to serve fresh fruit. it's the perfect size for that and suited my purpose to a T. the base is stable enough that you aren't afraid it will fall, it's solid enough to reduce breakage. (Yes, one broke already when it fell, but what can you expect)"
3,Mixed experience,"One of these came shattered, but Amazon refunded my money so no complaints there. I believe the problem was whoever packed them at the store they came from (not Amazon or UPS). The dishes are very pretty, but I'm nervous about using them because they seem a bit fragile. They are bigger than they appear in the picture, I wanted them on the smaller side to feed my kitties in, they hold in excess of 3/4 of a cup. I've never been afraid of dish before!"
3,Unimpressive,"I was excited when the cd finally came! I was listening to the first track and was impressed, greatly! Then I went to the next track. It was like the first one. All the songs sound the same. Sure, I like a couple songs, but the others are really just one big song cut into different pieces, given different titles, and then placed on different spots in the cd, and then called different songs. It is too REPETITIVE!"
1,too noisy,"I liked it's appearance and worked well so far, but it makes unpleasant noise when it heats up.not happy with noisy when i use it."
1,non-functional thermostat - on 2 different units,"As others have mentioned, the temperature control on our first unit was non-functional. The pan heated to the correct temperature, but then turned off and stayed off, as the pan cooled down to nearly room temperature. Eventually it turned back on, but the erratic temperature would make cooking impossible. Being an optimist, I exchanged the pan (thanks, Amazon, for such great customer service!) for an identical one. And when I say identical, I really mean it, because it had the exact same behavior - the thermostat comes on, the pan heats to what seems the right temp, and then turns off until the pan is well below the boiling point of water. Useless. So regretfully I returned the second unit - I say regretfully because in other aspects (appearence, size, sturdiness) it's a nice pan. I might add that the second unit was also very noisy for a device with no moving parts - making a loud hum, something like a bad neon light, when it was heating."
5,Great Fryer!,"I bought this to replace a nearly 20 year old unit my parents owned. If this lasts half as long it will have been well worth the cost. Plus, I'll probably inheirit it! It is very well made and the price via Amazon was very competitive."
5,Mobile Cooking,"At first, when it hummed, I thought loser. Then for some reason that sound dissipated and the skillet got really good and hot.It's mobile and I can take stinky frying outside then come back in a finish in the kitchen.But the style, depth, even heat, weight, coating and such, are top notch Cuisinart as you would expect. I love my cooktop but sometimes I want something that minds itself, has no flame and can keep the meal warm when we eat outside.And, this bad boy cleans up in a jif."
5,"High End, Even Cooking Skillet",Very Happy with this Appliance. Nice for cooking when you don't want to use the stove or if you have multiple items cooking at the same time.
4,"Wow, can you say big???????",This electric skillet is the biggest I have seen thus far. I have given it four stars because I cannot seem to get it to simmer on it's lowest setting. I have however found better results when I have a lot of liquid while stewing.All in all I would recommend this product to anyone and have purchased it as a wedding gift. Definately a much needed household appliance!
3,Cuisinart CSK-150 Electric Skillet,"I purchased the Cuisinart CSK-150 to replace a less expensive brand that literally fell apart after years of faithful service. I loved the look of the new Cuisinart skillet and its large non-stick cooking surface. HOWEVER, when the unit was plugged in and heating it emitted a high pitched whine and you could feel a slight vibration. I thought I must have a defective unit and returned the skillet to Amazon for a replacement. The return was a breeze and the replacement arrived quickly. HOWEVER, when I turned on the new unit it also whined and vibrated during the heating phase. I called Cuisinart technical services and they confirmed that the whine and vibration are simply a part of the unit's characteristics and are associated with the electric probe that is inserted into the skillet's body and are no way harmful to its operation. I have not decided whether or not I will keep the unit. Love the look, love the cooking results, but hate the sound."
1,WAS NOT SAME AS PICTuRE,I did not at all receive what was in the picture. I got a hook with two prongs on it...nothing close to something that can hold as many ties as it claims. Totally a rip off and not the same as advertised...stay away.
4,WOrks well and is compact,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the rungs are very close. It makes it harder to put the ties on so you can actually see them. Good buy, solid, sturdy, will support a full load of ties and/or belts"
4,great product,"I have purchased this before and have not found anything better than this. I have tried more expensive and cheaper, this is the one."
5,Unbelievable,"I did not think I would ever find this product again, but you saved my day. I just love the way it looks on my face, polished, refined, unmade up. I have never received anything that fast either. Good job, Amazon."
1,I'd give fewer stars if I could,"This thing is junk. Not hot enough. I think a little kid could drink my coffee, that's how cold it gets. NEEDS MORE POWER!!!"
5,Digimon Rulez!,Digimon is sorta like Pokemon but with only two thing in common. There's monsters and they evolve. Digimon is a cool animé as it is more likely that it could actually happen (Though it won't) and it's like in Pokemon if you hurt your hurt for two seconds then you fine but in digimon if your hurt you might need some help. (If you've ever seen the episode with the pyramid in it you'll understand.)
1,Facts and fiction merge to create beautiful looking garbage.,The illustrations in this book are wonderful. But the facts are missing. The author needs to research the subject before writing about it. I bought the book for my children and ended up throwing it in the trash can.
4,Breadshop's Granola,"Breadshop's Raspberry 'n Cream Granola is the best breakfast treat going. Not only is it a healthy food, but it's a delicious way to start the day. We travel quite a bit, and I can't always find a store that stocks it. That's what led me to Amazon.com; not only do they have it, but the service is great and I save money, too.Breadshop's has a full line of similar granolas, no matter what your taste. Mine happens to be the Raspberry 'n Cream. But there's more Breadshop's Granola to try. Check out their selection. (save me some Raspberry 'n Cream)."
4,A Good Goblin Score,"For the Luigi Cozzi sci/fi-horror flick Contamination, Goblin (Fabio Pignatelli/bass, Agostino Marangolo/drums, Roberto Puleo/guitar, and Maurizio Guarini/keyboards) composed a very atmospheric soundtrack. It's a fine score with Connexion and Withy being standout tracks. The bonus tracks (especially the Contamination two part suites) are pretty nifty, too. One caveat is that four tracks from the Buio Omega cd (Bikini Island, Pillage, Rush, and Quiet Drops) are repeated on this soundtrack (this was the way it was originally released in Italy; the Buio Omega soundtrack was unreleased for a couple of decades). The liner notes are pretty skimpy, too but these are minor quibbles. While not as strong a score as Suspiria or Zombi, it still delivers the goods."
5,My New Favorite...,"I bought this CD and let me tell you, she's bumped some favorites out of rotation. This woman can really sing. Fantastic voice, full of feeling, emotion. She's true and real! Great investment of my dollars. I've been trying to take her out of the CD player, but I can't. It's been a minute since that has happened. You just want to listen to her over and over again. I've turned on a few people to Rhonda Thomas and they are thanking me profusely. She steps out to center stage as a lead singer and I hope she never returns to the background again. Simply Awesome!"
3,Scrapaholics alert!,"She has great ideas, however I've seen most of them before through the company Creative Memories (which I really prefer- simple, classic, not cluttered, and your pictures are the main thing on the page- not decoration)."
1,Oh come on!!!,"Why do people automatically call crapfests like this ""only for true horror fans"" and such drivel. I've been a horror fan for years and years and know when a low budget movie is good and when one is crap. This...is CRAP! All us REAL horror fans rue the day they made digital camcorders and neato graphic art programs so easy to use and affordable, because now we have too many self proclaimed film makers crapping up the video stores. My children make better stories up with their homemade sock puppets. Stop luring us in with cool cover art, nifty taglines, then torturing us with stinko productions!!!!"
4,need a sound track please please please,please release a soundtrack to this movie the movie was very good i never heard about the movie and i live in boston where most of it was filmed and never heard about it who know i could of been a extra or something thanks alot a-pix enterainment
1,"Disappointimg, inside the beltway account of 96 election","Ok - so 1996 wasn't the most exciting presidential election ever, but this book fails to pick up on any interest that may be drawn from it. Focussing on those candidates who were well known in Washington, Woodward manages to miss any chance to discuss the surge and collapse of the Forbes campaign, give no adequate discussion of Perot and runs out of steam by the time his account reaches the party conventions. For an overseas reader, there is no insight into why Clinton was able to keep the Dole-Kemp campaign in his pocket for the whole of 95-96, nor any structure to Woodward's approach beyond chronology. Ultimately, this reader was forced to draw the conclusion that Woodward had got himself a contract to write the book, but was insufficiently interested in the material to do more than retype his notebooks."
2,Falls flat,"Rodney Dangerfield's MY FIVE WIVES falls flat about halfway into the film. Until that point, Rodney keeps it moving with his ever-sharp one-liners. Despite looking and sounding his 78 years of age when he made MY FIVE WIVES, time had not robbed the great funnyman of his gift.MY FIVE WIVES loses steam as it stumbles to a conclusion. Instead of keeping Dangerfield and his jokes the center of attention, the film concentrates on its ""plot,"" which concerns a land swindle and organized crime. Despite a supporting cast including comedians John Byner and Andrew Dice Clay, there's not enough funny stuff going on when Rodney's not on screen.In one MY FIVE WIVES scene, Dangerfield and the five young women he's married wear thong bathing suits. I'll give Rodney credit for doing a semi-nude scene at his age. Come to think of it, two of his wives don't look so hot from behind in those swimsuits, either, and they can't blame age."
4,"Very good up to IBM360, Great Bibliograpy, Highly Readable","This book focuses on early machines up to the development of the IBM 360. It covers both the technology and the personalities involved. It contains startling facts such as the Z4 (a mechanical computer) could reorder instructions to improve speed (circa 1948). It outline some of the most brilliant work in computer science. I wish it had more technical detail, however it does have an extensive bibliography. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in a deep understanding of computers. and where they are going."
5,Grapefruit Explosion!,Straight to you from Jamaica mon! This stuff is addictive. If you've ever been to Jamaica you'll know exactly what i'm talking about. Forget the ganja give me the TING! :D The product from this supplier is nice and fresh. I've bought from them a couple of times and the quality is superb. I still had a couple of bottles in the fridge that I bought a year ago and just opened one a month ago and it was still very tasty.
1,Dissapointed,"One DVD would not play..the second DVD played for 10 minutes and quit!! The problem is..who has the time to wrap them up and send them back? Even if I wanted to do that they came from 2 different independent sellers, I did not keep track of who they are..more research would probably give me the answer to this but this should not have happened, not 2 out of 2."
1,I dont like chesterton,If you like chesterton then you will like this book. If you dont like G.K. then you will dislike this book. He writes in an uneasy to read manner. Its as if Im reading a different language. No one speaks or writes like this
3,"If you can spend $90, you should buy something else.","I quite agree with the reviewers from Minneapolis, Denver, Stockton and Thessaloniki. True, Ahlfors was THE book on complex analysis (better known as ""theory of functions"" then) some thirty to forty years ago. But I can see no point in using it as a textbook now. As there are many good treatments on the subject today, it is high time we waved a farewell to this book. I recommend Cartan's book published by Dover since it is available for only twelve dollars."
2,pedgogically worthless,"I'm not sure why the other reviews are so positive. The book is very thorough and rigorous I'm sure, but the explanations are terrible. Everyone I've talked to in my class agrees that it's extremely difficult to learn from if you don't already know complex analysis, bbecause the definitions and order of treatment are very unintuitive. Example: residue at a is defined as the number R that makes f-R/(z-a) the derivative of a single-valued analytic function in 0<|z-a|<delta; why didn't he even mention that it's the coefficient of 1/(z-a) in the Taylor expansion? And he didn't even give any examples of specific residues. I ended up using a mathematical methods for physics book; it was the only way I could develop any kind of intuition for the subject."
3,"Not thick enough, not like picture","I ordered the french vanilla, which in picture looks very white. It arrived promptly, good job. However, the color is much more beigh-french-vanilla than in the picture - I can't wear this color. Also, this is a very thin scarf, not appropriate for the cold winter like I intended it to. I thought 2-ply should be thicker.Otherwise it comes with all certificates, just not good for my purpose. I returned it."
2,Not user friendly for lefties,"I purchased this game for my son. Once he was off to bed I decided to play it myself. Well, I discovered that it was not user friendly for us lefties. What I mean is most lefties would hold the joystick with their left hand but if you do that then you cant use the fire button because its on the upper left corner. I was really dissapointed. Of course the games dont compare to our PS2 or Gamecube but they arent supposed to. The games are similar to Atari games. But back to what I was saying,if you are a lefty you may not want to purchase this game. I tried turning the game around making the fire button easy to reach but that didnt work either.Like I stated earlier the games seem fun but they obviously did not have left handed people in mind when they made this game because they didnt put the fire button in a easy to reach place for a lefty."
3,it's not THAT great..,"I bought this and frankly, I wish i didn't. I guess it's okay for people who don't have a PS2 or anything, but it's kinda cheap. There are no cool graphics in the games and but they're not ENTIRELY boring. i can see how you can get hooked on them, but i would recommend that you just buy a Spongebob video game"
3,Great Game To Play But Broke Easily,My daughter really liked to play this game but after about a month of having it Spongebob's nose broke off. Now she plays it holding it in place constantly.
1,"Too small, but good concept","My kids absolutely adore the LeapPad. Hence, we have lots and lots of books and cartridges. The backpack only holds a fraction of them (four sets, as designed). We've essentially given up keeping the LeapPad itself in the backpack and use it solely to store the books/cartridges. It's a great product, but doesn't deliver as well as the LeapPad itself as it's just too small."
3,you get what you pay for,"New to the LeapPad craze, I ordered the backpack along with a LeapPad product, falling for the $5.99 special offer. The bag is much bigger than the LeapPad, which swims around inside, and the mini velcro tabs intended to keep the flap closed don't inspire much trust. We haven't actually used it yet for carrying, mainly for these reasons. But I suppose it's useful for a place to store the LeapPad and books, if not to actually carry them around."
3,better for travel,"this is a great item for use with travel. instead of me throwing a few cartridges into the bottom of my purse, they can be placed in the back pack. in this way my son can change the story every few minutes and he won't have to interupt me! This isn't great for storing the complete system in the house though, it only has room for 4 cartrides and my son already has more than 4, so still have to go thru the trouble of picking out the books before you go."
3,A Fair Start,"Sometimes a teacher identifies with and helps a child whose symptoms trigger that identification. Ms. Freud calls the ""sometimes"" too big a risk, and recommends that teachers be psychoanalyzed."
1,Panasonic PV-GS12 DVC camcorder,"I have been very disappointed by this digital camcoder. The movie picture quality was poor, worse than my old 8mm camcoder. I could not determine the still picture quality because the USB cable was not include, although it was supposed to be included. Advertisements stated it was easy to download to your PC, but there is no software included and none is available (as far as I can determine). Panasonic has been of no help, not even acknowledging a problem. Avoid this camcoder, I was not able to return the camera because I opened the box, and I can not get any help from Panasonic."
2,First MiniDV and very unimpressed,"Puchased this from Circut City at an open box buy of $330. Let me just say do your research on review sites and only pick the best rated ones. Video quality is very grainy. Indoors with the LED light is very choppy and takes forever to auto-focus in. The zoom is great for reaching out and touching someone. That's the only reason I gave it two stars. I wouldn't say I'd stay away from Panasonic's. But if I was to purchase one, it would probably be there 3 MegaPixel one."
4,Great Toaster!!!,The only reason I bought this is because I visited my sister over the Holiday Season and she had one and I liked it. I liked it even more after I bought it. Nice toaster!!!
1,Disapointed,same problem as D. Rowan - the first time used the 'carriage lever would not lock down`. Maybe a bunch of badly made production; others i see had no problems...shame sending back will spend the extra bucks on a Dualit!!
3,Sort of helpful,"I purchased this to help me with my math skills. The first time around I failed the Math portion by 3 points, tried to study from this again and finally passed. Now they're doing away with the Praxis exam, but it might be good for helping to brush up on basic reading, writing and math skills."
5,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!,"I read this book in a couple of days, because I could just barely break the stronghold my hands had to the covers to take care of my everyday living (eat, sleep, work, etc.). It's hard to believe that this is Colin Channer's (or as I like refer to him, Literary Maestro's) first novel. He writes with the maturity of an accomplished litterateur. He eloquently paints the pages of this book as (I imagine)Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa. He has a poetic license and is not afraid to use it. This book will take you on an emotional rollercoaster, but it's well worth the ride! My advice to anyone young in age or at heart: READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST TWICE!"
4,Waiting in Vain no more,I was totally wrapped up in this book! The thoughts and emotions of these characters keep me wanting to read more. I became a part of their lives and never wanted the book to end.
5,"Exhilarating, provocative, and educational","I've just finished reading Mr. Channer's book, ""Waiting in Vain,"" and I loved every page! It is funny, inspirational, uplifting, and informative. The characters seem to come-to-life in this story, and I believe, his prospective on love is right on target. If you're looking for fun and excitement, in a book, this one is a ""must."" Colin has even inspired me to make arrangements to visit Jamaica soon!"
5,Men do fall in love the same way women do!,"This is a passionate novel from a male point of view about love, trust, deception and respect within relationships. It will completely captivate you from the first to the last page. Men and women alike should read this book because it shows the romantic and sensitive sides of the man and what is even more refreshing and surprising is that the novel is composed by a man. This book depicts that men desire love and can give love in return."
5,Believable modern day love story with a strong social voice,"A modern love story written in poetic language that touches most present day social issues and yet remains very entertaining. Channers use of language is riveting, inspiring, and touches the soul deeply. An excellent book to add to a modern fiction collection.A must read for those romantics with a strong social conscience who yet want to remain grounded in reality.Excellent writing. Channer is a genius at creating believable but inspiring images."
5,Magnificent,"Never have I read a book so touching and life changing. I have been profoundly affected. Mr Channer has managed somehow to reach into the depths of his characters souls and make them so real that I now find myself looking and thinking that I too deserve a ""Fire"" After all Sylvia seems to be not only myself ,but several of my friends as well.I felt truly honored as a West Indian to find a novel that for once shows that we are a fiercely artistic,intelligent,well travelled and multi-faceted people. I have read this book Three times and each time I read every single word,page and Chapter.This book will Entertain and Educate......I went out and bought John Updikes ""Brasil"" and Rita Doves ""Through the Ivory Gates"" because of this book....what more can I say???I am breathless with anticipation for Mr Channers next Novel. Please don't keep me ""Waiting in Vain"""
4,brilliant concept!,"Love it, so does the baby. I just would have loved the stationary part to be a little heavier because it shakes when she starts running around it. Nonetheless, excellent product and a brilliant idea."
3,A nice addition,"This is a pretty good buy. It's very different from most activity centers because it doesn't bounce at all and I think that variety is important. The keyboard on it is great. The other toys aren't very interactive. Make sure when you put in the teething toys that you like the order they're in- once in they are REALLY hard to take out. My son is 7 1/2 months (he's a little under the average in height) and he still can't touch the floor all the way to properly move around in it. So don't be surprised if you put this together and discover you can't use it for awhile. What he is able to do so far he seems to enjoy, and I see a lot of great potential in it. If I had to choose between his excersaucer or this, I would definitely choose the excersaucer but I do think this is a great addition if you have the space."
5,My son loves this!,"I have a 8 month old and he can play on this for 30 mins to 1 hr! He's been playing this for almost 1 month now and still have not gotten bored with it. Everytime I put him in, he would start playing with all the toys right away. Is so cute to see him going round and round on this thing. This really is one of the best toys I've bought."
3,It's good,"This is a very nice product, however I think I got it too late. My son was 8 months old and even though he plays in it sometimes he rather be crawling around the house. When he does want to get in he runs around and around and loves to dance to the music, however he does not last more than 10 minutes in it. I had a friend whose son loved it and could be in it for longer stretches. I think I should have gotten it when he was younger."
1,missing screws,my bright starts tropical fun around we go activity station arrived WITHOUT screws. I am going to buy screws at the hardware store or return it.
5,Excellent Product,"This product is excellent. My son simply loves this play center. As a 3 mos old, he was comfortable playing in it. He is nearly 36 mos and still loves to play in it. Every Family I gave this product as a gift says it is their baby's favorite."
3,Much Better Than Nothing,"A film made in 1992 cannot revise itself. Obviously, it is not up-to-date, but with countries as old as these three, does that matter much? This is a travelog! Plus, since there are no other films on these nations, this will do nicely."
2,Dated and superficial though has some good photography,"An all too brief and cursory look at 3 different countries. The photography is nice, especially in Lithuania, which occupies about half the film. The viewer learns very little about the various peoples and cultures however."
5,Tanners Leather Oil,"I have been using Tanners Oil for more then 30 years. It's the bomb for leather care. Easy to apply and deep penetrating, well absorbed and long lasting. Keeps leather soft and pliable and is a savior for dry leather. Doesn't leave as greasy a feeling as pure neatsfoot oil."
5,The Restaurant Manager's Handbook,This book is very helpful in learning how to Manage a restaurant properly. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to improve their Management Style.
1,PARABEN Disappointment,"Zero Stars!With all of those natural and safe ingredients, Komenuka Bijin blew it when they added the very unsafe and unhealthy chemical preservative paraben.Disappointed beyond belief!"
2,Doesn't Clean Well,"I bought Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Powder. It is a powder cleanser that lightly suds up when you apply water. I got about three cleansings out of each packet. So the price is not a bad deal. I liked the scent and it seemed to be free of many chemicals. However, I noticed that it was not a good enough cleanser to remove makeup. So if you decide to buy this product you will need to use a toner if you want to make sure your skin is really clean. I used this product for 2.5 weeks, with the Komenuka Bijin Facial lotion. The results: The cleanser did not clean well enough to remove makeup and the lotion was so moisture rich that in the 2.5 weeks of using these products together made my skin break out all over. I am discontinueing use of both products. I would only recommend this product to people with dry or normal skin that never breaks out."
3,Not remarkable,"This stuff didn't do anything extraordinary for me, and certainly did nothing to justify the high price. It foams up and washes off easily but I broke out while using it. Either I was having a reaction from the ingredients or it did a poor job of cleansing(my guess is the latter). The only thing I really liked about it is its portability. This product is mediocre at best and there are much better cleansers."
1,Disappointed,"I did not find this product helpful. It didn't hold a charge, or maybe it was not what I was looking for because I thought it was a real battery."
2,same but not quite,although this battery did fit into the battery slot in my casio camera it is a very tight fit and therefore very difficult to get out of the coamera. It works but you need nails or other gripping toolto remove from the camera
1,Buyer BEWARE!!! Extreme DRM!,"Don't trust this CD or any CD from Sony BMG! They have included malicious ""rootkit"" spyware on a large number of their music CDs -- It could break your computer!!!"
2,Cover Rating R - Book itself PG,"Feel like the book is misleading - I'd rate the book cover as ""R"" - leading me to think it is an adult police-parannormal-romance, but the book itself is more of a PG read. Romance feels rushed - ""villian"" pretty evident from beginning - almost a Harlequin Romance kind of book. Not that there's anything wrong with that ....."
1,Don't buy this book,"A horrible piece of junk. I bought this book at a Goodwill store for .25 and after reading five pages of it, I wanted to go demand my money back. I can honestly say that this is the worst book that I have ever read. I hope this author doesn't quit her day job!!"
1,Trite,"I found this to be VERY uninspired and unoriginal. It was very vague, broad-reaching, lacking good research or support; not well thought out or put together. This was a total waste of my time and money. I highly recommend you watch Age of Deceit: Fallen Angels and the New World Order. THAT video is worth your time and money."
2,Not bad,"I bought this ring to replace one I lost, I was very excited to find one so similar. Unfortunately, the metal of the frog's leg seems to be more pliant than my old one because it lifts up with normal wear. As it lifts up, it is more likely to catch on items and people. It is difficult to wear this ring as often as I would like."
1,Unreadable,"I'm an avid hunter who tries to keep all sides of the issue in perspective. I picked this book up several years ago in an effort to perhaps broaden my knowledge. I have yet to be able, with multiple tries, to break past the first 50 pages as I find the text unreadable, wandering, and unfocused. Each time I try to ""re-read"" the book I tell myself that it will get better, just give it a try. It doesn't."
3,Finally!!!,"I was horribly disappointed with the initial release of this landmark series on DVD. Video transfer quality at best, and the butchering of the soundtrack, with the noted elimination of the hits that lent a superb atmosphere to the series, replaced instead with cheesy background noise.While I'm pleased that in this second release they've included the second and third seasons, the transfer is not as good as it should be, and the original soundtrack is still missing.I apologize in my earlier review that I indicated the original soundtrack was in, but this is sadly not the case.I'm still awaiting the release that this epic series deserves."
1,Budget-conscious Anchor Bay,"To say that Anchor Bay ""missed an opportunity"" is an understatement. Tv shows on dvd allow the consumer to fully immerse themself in a show with the episodes, commentary and extra supplements. I couldn't believe the price they're charging for this box set considering that all it has is the episodes in crummy mono with picture quality that doesnt even look like dvd half the time. Grainy and soft. I read on a dvd talk forum that the next Tv series Anchor Bay is tackling is the classic sledgehammer and if they do the same thing to that that they did here I actually will consider not buying it!"
5,Underrated series with an amazing cast,"This series only ran for two seasons and, in my opinion, was underrated. Good ensemble series with very recognizable guest stars."
4,Deanna O'Hara,"Up In Central Park is my favorite Deanna Durbin film. Deanna is in an all grown up plot and is in a role that is completely different to anything she's done. ""Oh Say Can You See"" is one of the catchiest songs she's ever done. An added plus is that the beautiful Deanna looks like the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara."
2,Maltin was right,"For once, movie critic Leonard Maltin was on target when he called this black and white musical from 1948 disappointing. It is, in the extreme. Durbin is getting a bit too heavy to place innocent young girls any more. (This is among her last films.) Vincent Price is a parody of himself playing Boss Tweed (who in reality weighed 325). The dance sequences are alarmingly cheap and uninspired. And the music is just plain bad. The film was based on a play, and some of the music was omitted. Why? In short, Universal has done it again: a very mediocre film that wastes the great talents of Deanna Durbin and Dick Haymes."
3,Fun for a while,"Perhaps it's my inner child's lacking attention span, but I found the Buddha board to be a relatively boring addition to my room.More fun for the occasional guest who asks about it."
5,this was a gift,"I have seen this in the past, so thought it would be a good gift for my nephew who has some disabilities. I hope he enjoys it as much as I would."
5,Great to extend the life of the bed,"I love these covers. I bought two of them for my two large dog beds, they fit great. I've washed and dried them several times. They will extend the life of my SSS dog beds. My dogs are diggers and they hold up well and wash great. They are cooler I think then the original cover for the bed. Dogs like them and the cat sleeps on them too. I'd love to see them in more colors."
3,Computers for starters,An easy guide for starters who can't stand the idea of reading.A complementary video or book is however needed to fully maximise the use of Windows 98.Might be rather difficult to fully comprehend for those computer illiterates seeking to learn fully on windows 98
5,Dragon's Fire,"As always, a very nice book. The focus this time is on the shunned and the watch weyers. Nice second book to Dragon's kin. Several of the characters return and several other rich characters are added. A must read if you like fantasy books,"
2,Deconstruction for Beginners,"I bought this book in order to gain a better understanding of Deconstructive theory. I was open to the comic book format which is quite fun, and the illustrator,Joe Lee,captures the feel of underground comics. I didn't enjoy the pornographic nature of the writing. Jim Powell's explanations for deconstructive theory are at times entrenched in direct references to sexual acts and male and female genitalia. I'm not a fan of porn, and most people who are interested in deconstructive theory are probably not either.Despite the fact that the writer's lewd and carnally juicy explanations are helpful in understanding deconstruction,I didn't enjoy reading it. After a sincere effort at gleaning the information I was looking for, I threw this book in the trash."
5,An excellent text of relevant content,"This text does an excellent job of introducing the reader to relevant material with regard to the study of environmental science. The chapters feature current real-life events in an extension format that allows for open-ended discussion and direct application of the content. The text does a great job explaining the role of socioeconomic factors as contributors to global environmental degredation. It can make one consider and question the logic and ethics behind much of what is done by government, industry, and the individual."
4,these tweebs are rally good,"i haven't had this much fun listening to a record since The Black Watch's ""Jiggery-Pokery"" or ""The Hypnotizing Sea"" (see Amazon!). what would happen if the Lilys stopped being haunted by my bloody valentine, or if the magnetic fields took steroids? if the beatles had been homosexual--and started dating 10CC...If Olivia Tremor control had ever learned how to write a straight-up SONG.Of Montreal would happen.""Albee"" and ""the party's crashing"" are celebratory anthems for the pansexual millenium. i HATED this record the first time i auditioned it--that's what often happens with the records i come to love. these tweebs are rally good. and fun. and literary in a less-than-pretentious way. they use KEYBOARDS. i loathe keyboards; only NEW ORDER are allowed to use them! 4 stars cause 5 is reserved for works on a par with...the nonpareil...like ""magical mystery tour."" buy this used and freak out on dance-twee."
3,God's Child,The story was great. Christopher Moore should have gone more into detail with the story because a lot of people can relate to the events and situations that take place in the story.
1,"Great glass cleaner, but not anti-fog","I work in a cold storage facility and am continually entering and leaving the 32 degree zone. My glasses fog up every time. I have used this as directed, but it does not work. It is a great glass cleaner, but that's about it."
1,NO!! Don't pay for this... do not even listen to it!,"Nauseating. How on Earth can anyone believe, after listening to those so-called Calipso-Caribbean puke-inducing songs like those on these CD that Norman actually wrote that masterpiece called ""James Bond Theme""? If I met him in the street, the kindest thing I'd do to him would be spitting in his face. The only consolation John Barry could have for Norman's robbery is that at least he (Barry) doesn't have his name attached to this disgusting, nightmarish frisbee."
1,This camera is a bucket of bolts,"I have a Panasonic camcorder, PV-GS15, five months short of being two years old. Now it is broke and does not work. However before it died, the screen kept turning blue with a message to hit the reset button. Doing so provided no positive results. I telephoned Panasonic and questioned the reason for this reset button, and their technical support could not offer an explanation. I noticed all Panasonic camcorders have this annoying reset button, while other manufacturers do not have this defect of an option. I suggest buying your camcorder from anyone but Panasonic."
2,Revealing what?,"The concept of the book is to reveal the errors of Islam, and the author manages to this to a certain degree. Unfortunately he also reveals his own flat-tyre Protestant theology! Comparing words in the two religion's main Scriptures is indeed important and interesting, but the author falls into the ""Bible-bashing-mode"" so typical of many protestants. He does not know and does not quote any of the Church Fathers' interpretation of crucial passages, and therefore he fails to make his case agains Islam and its literal understanding of spiritual life. It is a pity, because the author is well-intentioned and enthusiastic. But he talks too much about himself and his friends being ""spirit-filled"", and he never manages to get beneath the surface of the Christian Theological arguments against Islam. 2 stars for trying to do it anyway. Read instead St. John of Damascus' ""Writings"" in the CUA series."
4,Excellent Resource for Christians,This book is an excellent resource written by an Arabic-speaking Christian. He provides lots of great informatin on the history of Islam and the Quran and the full & real meanings of many Arabic words.The format of the book is a little difficult to follow and the organization of materials could be better. But the great wealth of information that is provided makes up for it.
3,"These are basics, but far too simplistic","There is no doubt that this book teaches you basics of how racing charts are interpreted. This book has talked about pacing, fractional time and key race etc. I believe it may be good for starters.I am however a little bit disappointed after reading this book. As a verteran horse racing fans I hope to find out more from this book before I buy this book. May be my expectation was too high at that time. If you have already read many books about horse handicapping, I recommend you miss this book."
5,Back To The Old Days!!!,"At the age of 37, I love the new gaming of today. But it is always great to go back and play the games of yesteryear when pinball machines ruled. Williams Pinball game is perfect mock-up of the old style machines. Great detail."
5,Great little game!,"I've recently discovered this title for the PSP, impulse purchased on a whim.The gameplay has a great feel to it, which at least seems realistic to the tables presented (which are actual pinball machines). The gameplay is easy to dive into, perfect for a handheld, but it's also good enough to continue playing for protracted periods. I think the number of tables gives plenty of variety, too.Every now and then, it's obvious the physics are not simulated accurately, but rather are predictable. That's not a big deal to me. Gameplay skill matters in these games.There are a couple of non-pinball games, such as the Xoltan fortune teller, which are worth a few minutes of amusement.For the dollar, even as a new game it's a great value for PSP gamers. It never feels like a cheap game, which is how I've felt about 90% of video games in this genre."
4,informative bp tale,"book was well written, easy for lay person to follow, insightfull and for the most part inspiring"
4,information,"When selecting these products from a page and the page gives you an option to see a larger picture, it would help if that picture gave you a better insite to what the product is capable of doing. I like the lable factory but it is not very easy to navagiate."
2,Disappointing book by and about a great artist,"I wish I could be enthusiastic about this book. Nicolai Gedda is truly one of the greatest singers of the century. But in this memoir he comes off as petulant and unpleasant. He spends too much time dwelling on past trangressions, inconveniences and problems and not enough on his career and the music. I welcome his honesty about his family background, but am disturbed at the way his parents are portrayed.Unfortunately the book is not redeemed by either the writing style nor the fragmented nature of the narrative.Better than some recent singer biographies (Sutherland et. al.) but still disappointing. This is a side of Gedda I wish I didn't know."
2,A bit of a dissapointment,"The premise of the story seemed interesting, but it was written in a way that reminded me of books required for my high school Lit classes. So if you liked your Lit class books, you might like this one, especially since there seems to be an abundance of imagery in it.The characters didn't seem to have much personality and the conversations were rather dull. I like getting into the heads of the characters, reading about what they're thinking and what makes them tick. After reading about 1/4 of the book I started skipping around to find more interesting character interaction - I didn't find many.If you keep in mind that this book was written decades ago, you'll find that it's a groundbreaking book. My aversion to ""classic literature"" may have tainted my experience, so keep this in mind when deciding whether or not you want to read it. It wasn't bad, I was just dissapointed, that's all."
5,Awsome Book Ever!!!!,"Once I started reading it, I cannot resist put down the book. Until I finished reading the book and felt relieve, because Therese finally able to live with Carol as what she wished the first time she met her at the Department Store. I recommend this book to whoever likes lesbian story."
2,"MISSING TRACKS, BAD RECREATION OF ""BOND77""","This soundtrack has a lot of tracks that are missing from the movie. There is a great one where music starts near the end of the movie after Stromberg says: ""Observe Mr. Bond. The instruments of armaggeddon."" Also the Bond 77 theme has been re-maked terribly. It isn't like the one in the movie. And that track is why I wanted to get this soundtrack in the first place. Track number 5, an instrumental version of The Spy Who Loved Me did not appear in the movie. And all the Egypt tracks are just plain boring in my opinion. Minus 3 stars for the missing tracks and bad tracks, but plus 2 for the vocal of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, Ride To Atlantis, and The Tanker."
2,James Bond Re-Recorded,"Of all the James Bond soundtracks issued, this is on the bottom of my list. I am not saying that the score heard in the film was bad. I am saying that this is not the score I heard in the film. I am not sure what it is. It is reminiscent of soundtracks issued during the 1950s where composers rearranged their film scores for commercial record albums.Composer, Marvin Hamlisch recorded the music in the film very well and seemed to be quite intuitive on what was required for different scenes. I believe that composers writing a Bond score are given great liberty to call upon previous musical cues from earlier entries in the series and write them into the score. It is very possible that Hamlisch was permitted to include only his original compositions for this album."
2,You Only Live Once: The Third of the Non-Barry Bonds,"""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977) attempted to harden Roger Moore's image as 007, and again a change in music was used to help refocus the image of James Bond. Broadway wizard Marvin Hamlisch was brought in, again primarily to produce a hit title. Carole Bayer Sager wrote the lyrics, Hamlisch the music and Carly Simon performed what became one of that year's hit songs and one of the best title songs of the Bond series. Alas, the score by Hamlisch left much to be desired. Marvin Hamlisch was not new to the craft of film scoring. After all he had done well with ""The Sting"" and ""The Way We Were."" But, at best, his efforts in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" were trendy parodies of John Barry motifs. Note especially what happened in the pre-title, ""Bond '77"" (compare it with Barry's theme for ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and even the pre-title music for ""A View to a Kill"")."
1,It died in 6 months,This toaster worked for 6 months. A small plastic piece which holds the lever down broke making it inoperable. It was impossible to repair.
4,Blondie for Victory,One of the best in the series. Fun for whole family. Good old fasioned humor at its best.
3,Syleena Needs To Stop Trying To Be The Next Mariah!!!,"I liked her previous two albums but this album definitly shows that she is not happy with her status in the music industry. She obviously tried to go for the whole ""I'm hot, so you should buy my album"" since not many people have heard of Syleena Johnson besides drom ""All Falls Down"" from Kanye West. Despite her new sex appeal thing she got going on, some of her songs are worthy enough for me to listen to, such as:The Flesh - Hot intro, love the beat 4/5Hypnotic - O.K. single, not as good as her previous singles 3/5He Makes Me Say - Better than hypnotic, just a little, 3.5/5Special Occasion - We're getting better! 4/5More - There we go! Really nice ballad w/Anthony Hamilton, 5/5Phone Sex - HOTTTTT SONG w/Twista, 5/5Another Relationship - ITS ALL DOWN HILL FROM HERE! It's sooo painful to hear her try the go high at the ending, but it has a catchy beat and I like the first minute, 2/5The Flesh (Outro) - HOT BEAT 4/5"
1,"Boring, Bland and BAD!","I first heard the song: ""Hypnotic"" months ago and I LOVE that song. It is a bumper through and through. However, this CD is a DUD through and through. Boring collaborators (Common, Anthony Hamilton) yawn. It is one sappy mess from the beginning to the end. NO beats....almost jazzy. Just boring. I am so disappointed. Just purchase ""Hypnotic"" from iTunes if you have not already. This CD is BAD!"
3,Look at my Flesh!,"Isnt it funny how blatantly sexual popular music has become? Im waiting for the next album called, ""Im naked, look at me!""Now I'm all for expression of sexual desire, as long as its artistic and tasteful. Anyone with a fair to nice body can put on a bikini and draw the eyes of any pre-pubescent male. I'm not saying this isnt bad musically. I havnt heard the album. All Im asking is when metaphor and subtely went away."
4,Don't miss any dialog,"I did like this movie, but you really need to pay attention to the dialog. Some of the accents can be hard to understand and with all the story twists, you need every line to follow along. I missed the first 5 minutes and ended up stopping it and going back to the beginning to catch it all. I will probably watch this again."
1,Tons of Potential but Disappoints,"I agree with the other reviewers. This film had all the potential in the world: great cast, incredible story, lots of atmosphere to tap into. But, in the end, it was truly disappointing. I love James Lee Burke - he's an American Treasure and this book rocked. But, the movie disappointed me. Can't recommend it."
4,Great movie!,"The story line is less traditional than your cop-goes-bad movies. Burke has a great storyline, and Jones and Goodman do really nice work. The backdrop of south Louisiana is wonderful, to boot."
3,A worthy effort,"I can only agree with much that has already been said: This film is beautifully cast, respectful of its place (and shot on the sites of the novel), atmospheric, and leisurely. It is remarkably faithful to the original novel, yet, because that novel is so interior and so complete, the movie version can't deliver the punch the book did. (I don't think the framing narrative helped.) The ghosts who are the protectors of the life Dave grew up in show only a little of the vigor they have in the novel; the very last scene of the film, a scene that made chills run down my spine in the novel, has no punch because there's been no setup for it.Really, a very worthy and enjoyable effort, but it does fall short."
2,Almost turned it off.,Had a difficult time sitting thru this entire movie. Moved very slowly and there won't be any Academy Awards for the acting.
2,Criminally bad,"Knowing James Lee B.'s amazing writing and the character David Robicheaux he created - this movie is so bad, it's criminal. To consider the money they had for this movie and the caliber of cast, such as Tommy Lee Jones to play Robicheaux it's absolutely a ginormous shame! It was directed by an old Canadian dude near 70 who clearly did NOT get J.L.B.'s writing, tone and feel of Louisiana, the dark underbelly, the southern Gothic dark tale at all. I wonder if he even read any of his books..."
2,Not so great!,This movie didn't make much sense. Slow moving. Still don't know why the guy killed all those girls. Two hours of my life I won't get back. Don't waste your time!
3,Tommy Lee Jones,"I watched this movie because Tommy Lee stared and it was filmed in southwest Louisiana. The movie was just OK. Acting was fairly good, story line was a step below."
3,Uneven but interesting,"I'm a huge Tommy Lee Jones fan but feel he was miscast in the role of Dave Robicheaux. Check out ""Heaven's Prisoners"" where Alec Baldwin plays Robicheaux the way James Lee Burke wrote of him."
1,Worst Movie EVER!,SOFA KING WE TODD ID. The most disconnected plot and wasted film. Can't beleive Tommy let this get to the theater.
3,Plot and story line can be confusing,Lots of action. Hard to understand the Civil War general's appearance. Stereotyped characters throughout.Story line could have been more coherent. I still liked it.
4,TLJ Tough Guy,Violence not suspended TLJ dishes out a fair amount of brutality but it is in keeping with the lowlife types that deserve it!
4,Tommy Lee Jones IS Dave Robicheaux,"Why didn't someone think of this sooner? Tommy is perfect to play New Iberia's finest and he delivers a sensational performance, perfectly capturing the character's Louisiana lilt. Others roles are just as well cast. Steenburgen is a terrific fit for Dave's wife. Fans of the books will see all the settings of the novels nicely realized as well, in a production that teams with local flavor and features a top-notch score. The picture does meander a bit and like the book the sub-plot with the spoiled Hollywood star doesn't work all that well, even though he's played by Peter Saarsgard.Not sure why this went straight to video as it's very solid- a must for James Lee Burke fans. I'll definitely check it out if Tommy does another."
4,Good movie,Entertaining. Tommy is a good actor and usually plays in good movies. This movie had good suspense and plenty of action.
5,Dave Robicheaux in film,"If you are a fan of Dave Robicheaux, you will like this film. Tommy Lee Jones is an excellant choice to play the lead. The film follows James Lee Burke's book closely but there are a few digressions. If you are not already a fan of Dave Robicheaux, this could get you started on the path. Buddy Guy's appearances and music, unfortunately, are too short and too far in between, the only disappointing thing about the movie."
4,Great batteries! Great Value!,Needed some extra batteries for my Kodak camera and these fit the bill quite nicely at a substantially lower price point than the Kodak batteries. They seem to work well and hold up over time. For the price I was more than satisfied.
4,My First Fantasy Book,"I first read this book back when I was in high school (year isn't important), and I fell in love with Poul Andersen instantly. The story is a bit sad, as it's about the end of the sea kingdom, but it's a good sort of sadness. I think it really spoke to me because it was about the ending of one thing, but the beginning of another, and that's what graduating high school is about as well. Definitely a good story for someon in a transition period."
1,No thanks,"My local library had a copy of this so I thought I'd check it out, why not I thought. This is one steaming pile of worthlessness. It wasn't even worth it, and it was free! Upon further researching the album it turns out it's a bunch of b-sides and covers to get out of a record contract. If that doesn't scare you away from this then I don't know what will."
3,"Okay read, but not fabulous","I got caught by this series because I liked another series by Hambly. I liked the first book of this series, but after the first one the other two weren't quite so thrilling. I read them all to find out what happens, and it wasn't painful, just reading to know. If you like Hambly's other stuff this would be a nice read, just expect there to be some unexplained or even hard-to-believe elements even within the fantasy world she's created."
4,Nice film.,"I purchased this not even knowing much about it. I am a big fan of Russell Crowe and have found most of his films, whether the film itself is good or not, he brings a certain life and charisma to each of his roles. This is one of his earlier films and certainly bears worth seeing. He won a best actor award for the role as well. You will have to view it with a certain appreciation and an open mind. The opening scene may shock you just alittle but it also expresses the carefreeness of his character, East Driscoll,so I can see how it was necessary to the storyline. I enjoyed the film very much...while it doesn't compare to some of his later films is nonetheless a delightful earlier film although, don't read if you haven't seen, it ends quite sadly. Crowe is wonderful as usual and it is neat to see some of his earlier work before he became such a big star. It is definitely worth a look-see. the acting is also superb."
4,"Great Movie, but heartbreaker!!","This is an excellent movie. All the actors do a superb job.Set in the late 1890's or early 1900's in Australian horse and cattle country, the story unfolds through the eyes of a young, crippled boy. His hero is East (they pronounce it ""Ace"") acted by Russell Crowe. East is a horse breaker (wrangler??)and owns a string of well-bred horses. The young wife of an elderly, wealthy Australian(English) land- owner wishes to breed a mare with one of East's stallions. From this a romance ensues. Charlotte Rampling is the upper class English wife, who falls, temporarily, for the illiterate East. Russell is superb riding his horses........... and one tremendously romantic scene has him galloping up to Charlotte as she rides, he sweeps her off her horse and they ride off laughing!!This is close to a 5 star movie!!"
4,Very Good Film,"First I must saw that Russell Crowe MAKES any movie that he takes on and he becomes the charactor, making the movie not only believable, but real. In this film Russell takes on the role of a man who is everything in the eyes of a young boy and also in the eyes of a married woman. I feel like I can relate to this story. As a young boy growing up with no older brothers I longed for the companionship of men like East, and now that I'm older, married and may be having a kid on the way I realize that it's only because of my best friends like Larry, Joe, Walter and Bill that I am the person I am. Other than the fact that the filming is kinda rough I think the film is perfect."
4,Russell does his usual great job.,"I am glad I bought this DVD. Being a fan of Russell's for 2 years now I had only seen a cut version on a cable channel. Not the best thing ever put to film, but it good. Did not need the nudity."
2,Overpriced because of name and look.,"I love Bodum, good stuff made by skilled tradespeople, but this kettle was stamped out in some factory in China. The lid falls off, the handle swivles and was way over priced. I was very dissapointed with this kettle, get an OXO, they have whistles and the lid won't come off and burn you."
2,Mastered from vinyl?????,"Listen carefully to the first song, ""Buy Me A Million Dollars,"" and I'm pretty sure you can hear the surface noise of a needle on vinyl. Which you can also hear, almost as clearly, on many of the other songs. The label credits say ""Tape transfers by Barry Piacente and Peter Dyer,"" and maybe Mr. Piacente or Mr. Dyer will read this review. Or maybe Bruce Baxter or Danny Beard can answer this question: Was this record mastered from vinyl? Or is there another reason for the distracting crackles?Love Tractor were a terrific band. But their longtime label, DB Recs, hasn't done much to honor or sustain the band's music."
3,Absolutely no concealment,"Holds my Colt Defender well, built well, rides at 4 O'clock nicely but there is absolutely no concealing even a compact 1911 with this holster."
2,Overpriced and difficult to erase,"I agree with other reviewers who said that the tags are difficult to erase and overpriced. There must be cheaper, one-use tags out there that would be more suitable."
4,wine tags,"I like these tags and they work well on my wine bottles. I do wish that there had been a grease pen provided with them since they are meant to be reused. Other than that, I am happy with them."
4,Wine closet organization,"Finally! I have organized our wine closet! Having these easily attachable labels along with a purchase of dry-erase pens in 4 colors did the trick. I put the year on the top of the label and the winery and varietal on bottom. I labeled the whites in green pen, the pinot noirs in blue, the reds in red and our favorite wine-maker in black (to match his label :) Not only does the closet look amazing when you open the door, but it's easy to find that special bottle of wine!"
1,Book is a photocopy of original,"Photocopy of original and copies are much smaller than page they are printed on. I don't consider this book a very good ""reprint"". It is a waste of paper. Save your money. Content is good, but a poor copy. Don't recommend"
4,Great book. Valuable resource. Subjective.,"I really enjoyed the book and learned alot about different religions but the author is very subjective. He seems sympathetic to certain very unorthodox religions and at times has a ""judge not"" attitude toward those that would differ with his opinions.Over all the book is very good!"
2,I don't think this book is a good guide book for drawing.,"the pictures are very exotic,it doesn,t tell how to draw women's faces and body motion,the illustration is not good."
5,This Book Explains So Much!,"As a long term certified user of Myers Briggs (worldwide, and in many organizational settings), I know its brilliance and its limitations. Pat Wyman's extraordinary research - and her system for integrating the MBTI, the Enneagram, and Inner Child work - both fills in the blanks and answers questions about the limitations of any single ""typing"" model. If you know the MBTI, you'll understand that, for example, five ENFP's may seem similar but have individual characteristics that make them quite different, too. By using Pat's system, we can clearly understand at a profound level the differences between an ENFP/Enneagram 2, ENFP/Enneagram 7, ENFP/Enneagram 8, and ENFP/Enneagram 3. This is amazing work that has informed my professional life and, most important, given me new insights into myself."
4,Readable history,"This is a good book for those of us who remember only slightly the history of the American Revolution from high school or college. It's highly readable, informative and, if you're an American, even inspirational. It's history that has been made enjoyable to read."
2,1957's view of life under the ocean in the 21st Century.,"The one thing that The Deep Range may have going for it, now that it is far past its pulp science-fiction hype, is that it was probaly part of the inspiration for many of today's techo-thriller writers.Many writers probably read this novel and said ""I can write better than this"". I have to agree with them. The Deep Range was best read when it was new, and part of the pulp craze. It is now not withstanding the test of time."
1,Disappointing Awful Movie,"Looking at the box leads one to beleive that Bruce Willis has a major part in the movie, the few minutes he is in the movie don't help this slow boring movie plod along. I can not beleive Bruce Willis would do a movie this bad. It went straight to DVD, with a major star like Bruce Willis in it, just says it all, a really bad movie."
2,"Wow, so Bruce Willis is THAT desperate?","I was turned off at first by the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a try, for Willis' sake.Boy, was that awful!"
1,wow this sucked,"So happy I only rented this garbage, only wish I could striken it from my memory. This has gotten to be about the worst movie I have seen this year. I would only watch this again if someone put a gun to my head."
2,"WIERD WAY TO WORK OUT, BUT NOT TOO BAD","I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR THIS TYPE OF WORKOUT, BUT IT WASN'T TOTALLY UNBEARABLE. THE GIRLS ARE FUN AND SPUNKY, BUT AFTER A FEW TIMES THIS ROUTINE REALLY WORE ON ME."
2,Not a satisfying workout.....,"There's only one video I like in this boxed set and that is the slim down.The music is a little boring and so are the twins, wish they introduce more moves.I do like the voice over. I actually sweat with the slim down video but the other one{fat burning} I didn't bother doing it after one workout. If you want a good workout get The sensous workout with Shamira and The Goddess workout."
2,Not my kind of book.,"My brother was diagnosed with cancer for two years and our entire family suffered from the event. When I saw this book I thought surely I would be able to connect to it. It was not what I thought it would be. It was very slow and I lost interest in it from the very beginning. I finished the book, but was very disappointed. Not a recommendation I would make."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable album that should have been a big hit....,"I have just begun listening to Anne Murray again after a long absence, and I would have to agree with the previous reviewer by saying that this is a very good album. The album was produced by Jerry Crutchfield, who was Tanya Tucker's long-time producer, and the production values are tight, solid and top-notch. There really isn't a bad song on the whole album. ""I Can See Arkansas,"" which was the album's primary single, is quickly becoming a favorite, and is reported to be a personal favorite of Anne's. ""You Sure Know How To Make A Memory"" is a lovely song about enduring matrimonial love, and I've long been a fan of ""Some Days It Rains All Night Long,"" previously recorded by Terri Gibbs. A very good album; buy it if you have even a remote interest in Anne's music."
5,gotor grip,this tool works pretty well. I was able to remove old bolts I could not otherwise remove with traditional sockets
1,Not Good,"I was so disappointed, it would not budge my slightly rusted screw, even with repeated spraying of loosing product. In fact, it would not even grip a perfectly proportioned screw..not a good buy."
1,POS,"The ""Gator Grip"" broke first time out. The pins inside the socket did not spring back into place. The idea behind the socket is sound, but the quality is lacking. I could not and would not recommend this product."
5,Works Great,I got this set for my father who loves it. It forms perfectly to the stuff that he needs it to. One item he says he's not going to give up easily.
5,One of those albums....,This is one of those albums that you need to have in your collection. Probably the best CD i've heard in a while. Can't wait to see these guys live in October!
1,Is it possible to digress artistically?,"Bummer, dude. These songs sound like pale rip-offs of ""Brian Jonestown Massacre."" Why listen to this album when you can hear the real thing elsewhere? Black Rebel Motorcycle Club sounds like Charlatans UK without the Hammond organ, or the talent and songwriting ability. Only buy this album if you find it in the discount bin for $0.99. It's easily forgettable."
2,2 and a half stars,"""Howl"" comes so close to being good. They capture a real authentic ""backporch"" sound, with great production. The lyrics are passable, the singing isn't too obnoxiously affected. But there just aren't any good songs on here.It's like when you meet someone who dresses well, seems to share some common interests, and can make small talk like a champ. But then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting, and just sort of suck all around. Well, it's the musical equivalent of that.They set a great vibe for beer drinking, sitting on the porch, etc. Just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel. But nice as they sound, whales don't write good music and niether do the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.Alot of people see music's primary function as providing a nice background. I'm sure they'll be pretty happy with this cd. Also, a lot of people are lifeless zombies with no souls."
5,Five Stars Plus!,"BRMC is one of the great newer voices out there.I don't know about you, but one of my favorite things is to hear a band evolve and to follow that evolution.If you wanna' hear the same album over and over again...just play the old ones.This is where they are now - deal with it - and be happy they're not just cashing the checks and phoning in their songs (like so very many bands do)...get with the program or be left behind."
5,What's wrong wit you guys?,"How can any brmc fan not love this album?!? The songs are pure brmc. It might take a few listens to hear it, but it's worth the effort. Try it in headphones. Reminds me a lot more of Love & Rockets than their previous releases. And that's a good thing, IMO.These albums don't come along often. And when they do, make sure you relish that sensation of hearing a classic for the first time."
1,Please Don't Buy!,Everyone please stand up for your rights - DO NOT BUY THIS COPY PROTECTED NONSENSE.
2,PRETTY MUCH [NOT WORTH IT],"Spy Smasher & King of the Rocket Men are NOT included in this box. What else you get besides what is shown is a Documentary about serials (my favorite part due to it informing me of other serials) and Radar Men From The Moon. Plus you are only given a few seleected episodes to watch. Like the beginning, a bit more, then the end. Saddly the best part is the documentary. I recommend purchasing these seperately, but it isn't all that bad a deal if you just want a quick get to know in regards to serials."
5,Jazz time travel,"As the applause reveals (you can almost count the pairs of hands clapping by ear) and the sleeve notes confirm, there weren't many people at the Village Vanguard on that now famous afternoon and evening. Today, how many people must wish they were there. This superb box set is the next best thing."
5,This is incredible!,"This has become one of my favorite jazz recordings. I never heard the original vinyl, but, even if there was extensive processing and restoration, here, you won't believe the quality of this recording. Kudos to the original engineers. With that out of the way, Bill Evans is impeccable, and I'd never heard of Scott LaFaro (on bass), but he really rocks here. I could (and do) listen to this set over and over again.Six stars!"
4,Great for Pre Readers,"This is a great book for people with the Leap pad and are looking for a book that is for younger kids. My daughter is 3 and she is able to follow alot of the concepts with this book. Each page is dedicated to one letter and there are lots of pictures to touch with the pen that make music and stories. I recommend this book for younger kids who are learning the alphebet. Very colorful pages with lots of easily reconizable picutes.(frogs, ice cream, apples)"
4,KITCHEN STAPLE,"I don't know what everyone is expecting. Who cooks from just one book? These recipes are terrific for anyone looking for some simple but tasty LOW carb meals, not NO Carb meals. The recipes call for lots of vegetables--spinach, broccoli, leeks, cucumbers, peppers, mushroooms, cauliflower.... What I like best about the Heller's program is that I can eat a variety of foods and don't obsess over calories. I would've like some nutritional info though."
2,"Same old, same old","I was eagerly anticipating this latest publication by the Hellers. After reading through it I must say I am quite disappointed. The vast majority of the ""recipes"" are extremely simplistic and could have been thought up by almost anyone. I was really expecting some NEWER and innovative recipes. This book is a good starter for anyone who doesn't have any low carb cookbooks at all. If you are a newbie to the low carb way of life then this book is for you. If, on the other hand, you have been on any low carb program for any length of time, you are probably familiar with most of these types of recipes and I'm sorry to say that what's in this ""new"" cookbook is more of the same old, same old. The Hellers are great people and thier programs are fantastic, it's just too bad their recipes are not."
5,Great History.,"You hear often of how much Hollywood pays for screenplays and adaptations of popular work, but it seems that many times they overlook the most obvious source of magnificent drama which is history. With Fire and Sword was shown in Chicago back in 1999 and I always regretted missing it. Fortunately, I was able to catch the quick moving period piece the other day. The battles between the Poles and the Cossacks were riveting and spurred me to do a little research about author Henryk Sienkiewicz. As always, however, I loved seeing the beauty of the winged hussars charge into battle--a sight artfully recreated in With Fire and Sword. One's interest is piqued every time a horseman makes an appearance. It's hard not to root for the Ruthenians, and the love story makes the need for their victory all the more compelling. Overall, this is definitely a needed changeup for the mainstream viewer who has grown tired of Hollywood's schlock. I highly recommend it."
2,Falls Flatter than a 2D Object,"I am a big fan of Dan Ablan's previous Lightwave books. He is a great instructor and very talented 3D professional. So I purchased ""Lightwave 8 Killer Tips"" hoping to learn new things specific to version 8...Disappointingly, this book falls flatter than a 2D object. Nearly all of the tips mentioned are ""old news"" to anyone with a basic understanding of older versions of Lightwave. Only about five percent of the material in this book has anything to do with features specific to version 8.I wouldn't be as upset if the book were titled ""Lightwave Killer Tips, Including A Handful For Version 8"". That's because I wouldn't have bought it.I can only recommend this book to rank beginners who don't know many Lightwave operational tips in general. So the book is not a complete stinker. But it's not worth $39 either."
1,to bad they dont have negative stars,This game is awful I have more then what is called for for system requirements and It wont load its worthless its almost as bad as lockon but at least with lock on i get a scrambled image of whats going on this game wont even load up and you email the tech people and get no reply what so ever get strike fighters its fun with decent graphics and game play dont waste your money on this waste of a rom
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are a fan of F18 Korea or K18 PSF this game is a disappointment. It contains a few bugs that completely spoil the game. The HARM missiles are useless on the medium and hard levels, they (the HARMs) fly of course and never hit the SAM sites. In the middle of the game sometimes my joystick just quits working. Also the city of Baghdad contains no building, or Baghdad International airport. I sent an e-mail to Xicat interactive and they never responded. I even downloaded the latest patch for this game and it did not correct these issues. Xicat sent this product to the market without good QA. Don't buy this game unless a new patch comes out to correct the problems."
3,What? please not again!!!,As with many books writen by Virginia Andrews this book follows the life and love of Ruby when her world is turned upside down. The story follows the same basic formulae of all her books. Heroine (as all the stories are about girls) falls in love with someone she shouldn't and has to give him up. In the mean time the heroine is made pregnant and the question of will she survive the blows that fate will give her. Will she see the man she loves again or will he walk out her life? The endings are nearly all the same and predictable. Left open for another just as simple sequel.
1,VC Andrews DID NOT Write this BOOK!,"VC Andrews died YEARS ago yet somehow more books are written each year by ""her."" The publisher continues to ""write"" books for her! This is crazy!"
4,Depressing,"This book is by far the best in the Landry series. I couldn't put it down. The one thing that bothered me though was that I was feeling depressed through the whole thing. Even people doomed to hell have good days once in a while. One bad thing after another kept Ruby down. First Beau diserting her, then Paul pressuring her to live with him and have sex with him, then Gisella and Buea coming back, and Gisella getting sick. IT seems all is happy aftet that, but you just know somethings going to ruin it. The only complaint I have of the whole series is the depressing atmospher and Ruby's lack of backbone. Other wise, this book and this series are the best I've ever read."
3,Army wives,"When their officer husbands are posted to Northern Ireland, Kate, Emma and Laura band together to keep their sanity and their independence. Emma is the experienced army wife, wise in the ways and protocol of wives of more junior officers deferring to the more senior wives. Kate is the new girl, newly married and totally unaware of the way she may be offending the old school and perhaps even slowing her husband's chances of promotion. Laura is the wild one, married to a pompous prig of a man who is a bully and a self promoter. She hates him so much that she deliberately baits him by flaunting her considerable sexuality. The inevitable happens in such an explosive atmosphere when a soldier is murdered and the blame could be laid at the door of many. It's a better read than one might expect from the cover, with the murder mystery running through it."
3,E.M.I Legends of Rock n' Roll Series,"After having heard Del Shannons' ""Runaway"" many times over the decades I found the Ver. 67 of this song to be a painfully ( dare I say excruciatingly) slow ballad style of this song. It sounded like a 45 rpm record played at 33 1/3. The original played for 2'20"" while this version plays for 3'30"". But if your looking for some 'hits' not found on other compilations this could be for you."
1,Will somebody please shoot me and put me out of my misery?,"How did John find time to put out 3 albums of this stuff? Not to mention the assorted bonus tracks this record company ""kindly"" added.Too bad Paul at the time didn't compose a tune in tribute of this bizarre union called ""Beatle Nightmare""."
1,Wait...JOHN LENNON recorded this album?,"This must be some kind of sick joke! John Lennnon was brilliant with the Beatles, but he leaves and puts out THIS? Sure, he was known for the more offbeat songs (Norweigan Wood, Tomorrow Never Knows, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, I am the Walrus, Strawberry Fields Forever) but THIS cannot even be CONSIDERED MUSIC! Twenty-four minutes of wailing followed by twenty-two minutes of screaming ""John!"" and ""Yoko!"" over and over again...could be the worst album ever. John was a brilliant mind, that's for sure, but this is just overkill."
2,WEDDING ALBUM,"Do you want to know why I used to like this album? Answer: When it was on vinyl it came in a nice box (approximately 12"" x 12"" x 1"") and had a lot of paper goodies inside. Musically, that was and still is another question. What is the point of issuing this on CD?"
3,the worst of (the really great) veena & neena tapes,"I really love the Veena and Neena Bellydance Fitness for Beginner tapes. They're the only workout tapes that I really enjoy doing, and that don't make me feel like an out of shape loser.That said, I don't really enjoy this particular tape all that much. I find the moves to be too repetitive and not ""bellydance"" enough. If you want a workout that is more challenging than the ""basic moves"" tape, but still retains the general feel, I suggest the ""slim down"" tape. It still gets you sweating, but has more variety and flow."
3,The college cookbook,some ideas for meals. Needs some update. On the whole the recipes were simple and within a college student's resources.
2,contrarian view,"As a long-time fan of Cole Porter, I found this recording a mishmash of vocalists promoting their own singing style and mangling the purity of the composer's work. What was done to ""Begin the Beguine"" is beyond description."
5,"The ""Light Bulb"" Went Off!","I've always wondered why my relationships failed to meet my expectations? The ""light bulb went on"" after reading ""The Givers and the Takers."" An easy read, the book provides the reader with thirty defining traits for the two personality types. After studying them, I learned to recognize the traits and apply the remedies suggested in the book to improve my relationships. If you want clarity in your relationships this is the book for you. I highly recommend it."
4,the best!,"This is by far the best set of pots and pans I've ever had. I like how evenly they heat, that they're not so heavy, they are super easy to clean, and I personally like the color of the handles. Just avoid using metal cooking tools on them."
5,Really Nice Cookware Set,"I waited 40+ years to buy a new cookware set - giving daughter my old one. I wanted a non stick set with substance. This set has it all. Good variety of size pans and skillets. The clean up is a breeze. There are a few additional pieces I would like to add and fortunately they are available - no more mismatched sets. The set is a very good value. I do like Rachael Ray, but I would have bought this set without her name on it."
1,RACHEL RAYS ANODIZED POTS AND PANS.,"I BOUGHT M/S RAY'S ANODIZED POTS AND PANS FOR MY WIFE AND I WISH I WOULD BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND.WHEN WE WASH AND DRY THEM THE OUTSIDE COATING COMES OFF THEN WE HAVE WASH OUR HANDS.IF I HAVEGONE TO K-MART AND BOUGHT A CHEAP SET I WOULD BE WAY AHEAD.IF YOU WANT PIECE IN THE FAMILY,DON'TBUY THIS PRODUCT."
5,THE BEST SET YOU WILL EVER BUY,THE PAN SIZES ARE GREAT AND I WOULDN'T TRADE IT IN FOR ANYTHING ELSE EVER!!!
5,Best cook pots ever,"I bought the same cook set a couple of years ago but had to leave it behind at my last house hold. I immidiatly replaced it with the same set as those are the best pots that I have ever bought. The pots are heavier than the average non-stick cook ware and therefore sit well on the stove, ensuring evenly distributed heat.The pot sizes are great for the average house hold. The lids don't have vents which would be nice. Some people complain about dirty handles. I never had the problem. I learned though that one really needs to pay attention to not cook on high settings with non-stick cook ware. I ruined both frying pans of my first set by doing so and now dilligently keep the heat to medium-high. These cook pots transfer the heat so well that no dish should need to be cooked on high. Great Product."
5,Awesome Pans,"I have had these pans now for almost three years and they still look brand new. I don't use metal cooking tools with them, but these pans wash easy, and food don't stick on them. When the time does come that I need to purchase new pots and pans I will more than likely purchase a set of these again. You can not go wrong with these. Plus the price on Amazon is great. Great product for a great price."
4,Good Value on Cookware,"Very nice cookware. Lighter weight than some anodized, but very adequate. Good value."
5,LOVE IT,Great set of pans/pots - everything slides right off of them. Clean up is a breeze. Great price!
5,Very happy!!!,"I love my new pots and pans. The only thing I wasn't completely happy with was that the skillets were a bit small. Other than that, I love the products themselves."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Seems quite on the low-end. Cute, if you are into orange handles. Doesn't really go with most decor. The exterior is not dishwasher safe. The sizes are too small. I'm not a single college student in my first apt. I am trying to cook for a family. The lids are too bulky. Difficult to store. The bottoms are not thick or with any efficient heat distributing construction. I returned them."
4,Just a bunch of pots and pans.,"Not much to say, bought these as a gift because my stepdaughter wanted them for some reason. Just a bunch of orange cookware, look fine to me."
5,Just bought these today!!,"Although I've only cooked with one of the pans, I'm already impressed!! They are very well made. Call me crazy but I'm sure the raviolis were boiling more 'evenly' than usual. I'm really looking forward to breaking these in. Buyer's tip: shop around.. I bought mine at Kohls for over $50 less!"
2,Lids Rust,"I was very excited to get my Rachael Ray cookware but now wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. The cookware is great, the handles feel nice and the food heats and cooks evenly. My problem is with the lids. The metal rusts where it meets the glass. I noticed the first spot of rust within the first month of using the cookware and now six months later each lid has at least a spot of rust. Some lids have extensive rust. Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed and will not buy her brand ever again."
2,Just ok,"Pros: The pans look nice and the handles grip well. They will not last.Cons: After just 1 year, food sticks, even spaghetti boiling in the pot. The coating is flaking off around the edge of the pans. I use them for camping now.I love Rachael Ray products, but not her cookware. This may be apples to oranges, but Calphalon Unison is a much better choice. They cost more, but if you cook a lot of gourmet food at home, you'll really appreciate them! Just buy one at a time like I did."
5,They are GREAT!,"I absolutely love this set! So easy to clean, cooks evenly and I have yet to see them stain. The skillet isn't that big however she does offer a bigger one and I am definitely going to get it. Using these makes me excited to cook in the kitchen."
1,Worst cookware set,"For the price paid and all the hype for Rachel Ray cookware, I can say I am very disappointed. The coating on the outside is coming off--leaving black smudges on my hands. The cookware set did not hold up for even a year. Sad to say that beyond the cookware, all other pieces are not up to the expectation I held for this line."
1,Glass lid explodes!!!,Beware of glass lids! I was cooking free beans with one of the smaller Lids and it blew the glass top causing small glass pieces to go flying all over my kitchen!!
3,on the fence about this item,"though I love cooking with this set, the smallest of the pots and the big saucepan is starting to peel off on the outside. I do not put this set in the dishwasher, always wash by hand and toweldry quick but the two specific items is looking terrible for some reason, almost like it might be coroding or something..the big pot especially and other items work great though, I love this set..well some of it anyway"
5,Best buy for a great set of pots.,We have only had these pots for a few weeks and they are the best. They cook quickly and are very easy to clean. Plus amazon sold them for the best price.
5,Very goood buy!,"I bought this set about a month ago. The hard anodized cookware makes for even cooking. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is serious about cooking. The product is not made of thin material but is very sturdy. One warning though, the handles are porous so make sure to wipe up any spill and do not soak in dirty water (this is just the colored part of the handle). The handles do not get warm when cooking."
1,Not Seasoning this is a paste,Not a seasoning it is a paste though I was buying jerk seasoning.Product arrive within ample time but if not what I expected.
5,An awesome record!,"I didn't realize this CD was rare -- I've had my copy for a long time (can't even remember where or when I bought it). Anyway, this is a great live recording. The balance is spot on -- very close to a studio recording in my opinion. The Four Freshman's harmonizing is very tight. When June, the Freshman and the band all join in for the final four pieces it's truly magical. If you are Kenton aficionado and haven't heard this recording you will truly enjoy it."
4,oh nostalgia...,"was VERY happy i found this here, i am a huge fan of tmnt and this was a great purchase for me.."
3,not low impact,This video is a good work out and will get you moving but for someone with knee problems watch out. The first part with basic moves is good but the fat burning cardio has a lot of jumping. This part is not only very hard on your knees but you do the same move for almost 5 minutes straight. I am in good shape but had very minor knee surgery 7 months ago. My hasn't given me any problems for at least two months untill I tryed to do this video.
2,Not much fat burning,This was not what I was imagining. I thought this DVD was going to really get me moving and burning fat. Instead it was so basic with learning simple movements that I become extremely bored with the DVD.
2,Thoughts on the twins,"Wow, this is by far the worst dvd I own. Aerobically-its a good workout but you have to suffer through long repetitive movements that get boring FAST. Plus you have no shoes on so make sure the padding under your carpet is new to avoid injury. And, I never felt like I was even close to belly dancing. The extra dance segments that feature the twins dancing made me feel that this video was more about their self promotion than me getting into shape. Pass this one up or give it to your man for his personal enjoyment-thats about all its worth."
4,"Fun, good workout!","I really enjoyed this video, I even purchased a hipscarf so I'd feel more ""authentic"" while working out. It was a fun way to learn a few bellydance moves and get a decent workout in the process."
2,"Love the Basic Moves, Hate the Fat Burning","I really like the Basic Moves section. It's not an aerobic workout, but definitely strengthening. And it's a great way to learn some of the 'basic moves' that they use in their other DVDs.However, I did not like the fat burning portion. I was bored to tears. It's a lot of bouncing, no hip or belly work at all. Fitness for Beginners: Slim Down is a much better (though still not perfect) option for an aerobic exercise [see my review for that DVD]."
5,Good Workout for a Beginner,"I disagree with the people who say this workout doesn't teach you to dance -- a lot of what I've learned from just this video I've used while dancing. The two times I've gone dancing, in fact, people have turned and cheered me on when they saw I was shaking my hips like there was no tomorrow.But it probably is a poor video if you're looking to create dances out of what you learn here. It's an EXCELLENT video, though, if you want something unusual and fun to add to your workout routine, which is why it's called the Bellydance Fitness WORKOUT.If you don't have a lot of money, go with this video first. If you're out of shape (like me), it WILL get your heartrate up and stretch your limbs. Then when you get to a point where you're able, go for one of the other three.I recommend it for a workout. There are moves in here that make a woman feel sensuous and sexy, even if she doesn't have Neena or Veena's body :)"
5,this book is yummy!,"I adored reading this book! True, it isn't earth-shattering philosophy; and if you want deep meanings, you're out of luck. If you want a fun bit of fluff, however, STATELY PURSUITS is positively delightful. The book is full of humour and quirky supporting characters;and I love the two leads, Hetty and Connor (especially Connor!). All in all, STATELY PURSUITS is a wonderful comedy!"
1,"Great start, but petered out in to a dull and rambling book.","I was looking forward to this book because it sounded so humorous and cozy--and, indeed the first half of the book was excellent. It started to bog down in the middle, most unfortunately, and I was only able to skim the last half. This is the first book I've read by this author, but even the entertaining first half of the book won't motivate me to read another."
5,Healthier and tastier than white pasta,"This is a staple in this house, my man loves it. Many times I just sprinkle Parmesan cheese on it and it makes a meal for me or I stir fry some veggies and use that for extra nutrients."
4,Good history,I was disappointed that the story does not even mention the Britten effort from New Zealand on one of the most innovative machines ever built it also leaves out the crash that took the life of Mark Farmer. It is as if the team from NZ did not even exist.
3,"Mediocre, unfortunately","It's mostly the same style as Formulas Fatal to the Flesh. However, the music simply isn't as good as even that album. The first song is pretty good, the rest are average."
3,...Not too good,"If this were just any no name death metal band's album that didn't have an incredible history behind them this album might be acceptable. But this album is a let down in every aspect and is nowhere near as good as classics like ALTARS OF MADNESS or BLESSED ARE THE SICK. Some of the songs on this album are good like ""Summoning Redemption"", ""He Who Sleeps"", ""Opening of the Gates"", ""Secured Limitations"" and ""I"". But then songs like ""Ageless, still I am"" and ""To the victor the spoils"" are simply unlistenable. Also the vocals on this album really are poor I think they need a new vocalist. Also the production doesnt seem right. If the production was better and the vocals were done right than this album could have been great. But it is only mediocre and is only for the die-hard Morbid Angel fan."
3,"Morbid Sludge, Homogenous Ooze-Metal.","Sludgy grinding rhythms. More melodic guitar solos than on any Morbid Angel album next to ""Blessed Are The Sick"". ""Gateways"" is my least favorite Morbid Angel album. Songs are homogonous, and generic sounding. This album is closer to a Cannibal Corpse record. The tour for this album was intense, as their success finally led them into arenas with Pantera. Overall, a consistent effort. A very different direction from the band's second through fourth albums. Not as memorable as ""Formulas Fatal To The Flesh"". Nice arrangements."
5,An underappreciated masterpiece,"Morbid Angel's Gateways To Annihilation is an under-rated masterpiece in my opinion...this album does not make them a ""sell out""...a sell out to me is someone who COMPLETELY changes their style and sound for more money...in my opinion,Morbid Angel did not do that...they still have awesome guitar solos,Pete's drumming is still as amazing as ever,his double bass work on ""Opening Of The Gates"" sounds like it was played by some demonic cygborg drummer...Steve Tucker's vokills are higher-pitched than David's,but he does an amazing job,and his bass playing seems to be as good as if not better than David's,(when you can even hear either of them)...This cd has some amazing atmosphere too,it takes me on a twisted ride thru the cosmos...the artwork is worth mentoning too,it fits the music perfectly...this cd should be enjoyed in a dark room with headphones,it is really worth the time to listen to this masterpiece,highly recommmended!!! 13 stars out of 5!"
2,Bombastic &Boring,"Gateways..was a big disappointmet!!Although i must have played it a hundred times i couldn't get into the songs!The tracks are boring and without signifcance,and the new bombastic style doesn't fit Morbid Angel at all!Also is Tucker no real replacement for Vincent,that's bad enough,but normally the good songwriting would help to forget the loss of Vincent,but here is everything ruinend from pathetic and ""majestic"" parts! You can't find one song here that could touch one from ""Blessed...."" or ""Covenant""!The tracks simply don't get you by the balls,they lack the ""dionysic"" energy from the classic Morbid Angel-masterpieces!Gateways blows,sad but true!"
4,Surprised people don't like this album.,"I just assumed this would be considered a classic Morbid Angel album, I'm surprised to find a lot of people don't like it. I'm glad they try new things, I like the slower pace."
4,Not for a Dell M90,"The laptop enclosure will definately NOT fit a Dell M90 17"" laptop when new, maybe when the bag has aged and stretched or something. No matter, my Dell M90 fits into the main section so I'll use that instead, it does mean the back is an inch or two thicker than it needs to be...Overall fit and finish seems very good the padding makes the bag quite comfortable. I'm headed to Las Vegas tomorrow with this bag, will see how it does."
3,"Nice bag for 15"" laptop","This is a nice bag if you have a 15"" laptop, but mine is bigger and this bag didn't come close to fitting. I can't imagine that it fits ""most"" 17"" laptops. In fact, I can't imagine that it fits any 17"" laptops. Even ""slim"" ones. The laptop enclosure is accessed via a side zipper and there's no room for error."
2,I was surprised,"I knew when the product said O'jays, I would love it; however, I was totally dissappointed. I did not think O'jays would put a second rate product on the market for Christmas. I will listen before I purchase a product solely on name, forthgoing."
2,"Not an Academy Award winner, but was thought provoking.","I was impressed with Dorothy's converstion experience and her commitment to the poor. However, the film could have used better editing, especially when it moved forward in Dorothy's life. Scenes were too chopped up."
5,The Power of Service,"I watched this video with a group of high youth, the response was amazing. Many expressed openly their concerns of the poor and their compassion was evidant. Social Justice is a ministry that usually gets attention during the holidays - we can change that. I recommend this video to all teachers working with youth - help shift the focus from materialism."
1,This is a scary book.,"I couldn't help but notice that most of the positive reviews came from Tennessee folks. To non-resident fans who just want to gain insight into her coaching methods, this woman seems brutal and degrading to her players and obsessed with basketball to an unhealthy degree. With her success, it frightens me that coaches of younger girls will emulate her style and make life miserable for developing young talent. The book is certainly revealing, well written in a folksy way, but unsettling."
5,A Master of Success--A Must Read!!!!,"Of course, I could not just read one of Pat Summitt's books, I had to read all three. Pat has a plain, matter-of-fact and in-your-face style that is refreshing. If you can not find the mountain of success to climb, Pat will bring the mountain to you. She forces you to look at her definite dozen and find the areas where you know you could most likely improve. And without fail, she will lay down the gauntlet challenging you. She makes you believe that success is within everyone's reach, if you would just work at it. I have made some adjustments myself, since I have started a part-time home based business. I have read a number of books on success. ""Reach for the Summit"" is by far the clearest, simplest and most inspiring that I have read. GREAT WORK PAT!"
5,Live sound use as a db25 modular snake,"Recently I bought this item to use it as a modular snake (100ft). A friend bought a HEAR Technologies monitor system. So I tough lets use this cable an try it out since the ""proper"" cables are way more expensive. I had success, everything works properly. I didn't had any noise or distortion. The cable seems thiner than the ""proper"" cables so I am not putting so much stress on it. I believe that if I take good care of it, is going to last. If not I can buy another one and still save some money.Now I have a new project for it and I am planing to get another one. Now that I can control the monitor mix with an iPod/iPhone/iPad in my Presonus StudioLive I will buy a 6 ch Headphone amp and use this cable again as a modular snake to save some returns in the snake and have 6 aux mixers on stage."
4,Great insight,"The book gives wonderful insight as to how one can quickly and easily learn any language using the methods in the book. It is a little outdated and does not include online resources to aid in language learning adventures, nor does it include any software references such as Living Language or Rosetta Stone (the book still mentions cassette tapes as a valuable learning resource, which they are, its just that cassette tapes are not mainstream anymore) The book would be more useful if it included references of more up to date media available to help in learning languages."
5,polyglottal,"Excellent, conversational, makes language seem easy and fun, with dedication of course. I've used several of his suggestions to accelerate my familiarity with a couple new languages."
1,Didn't teach me anything,I didn't read anything in this book that would help me learn a foreign language. One third of the book is about the author's biography and his interest in foreign languages. It was a real disappointment.
3,"The deflector works, but the filter cannot be attached.",The deflector works great. I am no longer paying to air condition my windows. The air flows nicely into the room.The down side - there is no way to attach the dust filter.
2,Arrived broken,"I ordered five of these deflectors for my air/heat floor vents. They work well deflecting the heat/air and the magnet is sufficient to hold them in place. However, the plastic is very delicate and two of the five deflectors I ordered arrived broken. Also, they were packaged in very flimsy boxes. Rather than pay shipping to return, I had to tape them together. It works that way but is not very attractive. I'm very disappointed"
2,"Dreadful, but there's little else out there...","Sadly, what could have been a good book turns up very poor. First of all, did anyone EDIT the book? I can't even count the mistakes in the book, especially the absolute murdering of names and places. Parts of the book were written as if the target audience was comprised of 5th graders; elsewhere it was a family tree mess. And worse, parts of the book were misleading and apologistic. Wikipedia did a better job here."
5,Great bible cover,The cover was a great deal!Good material and quality workmanship.I only wish this particular dealer had this item in more colors.
1,UNUSABLE,"Unusable is truly the only way I can describe this product. I have never been so disappointed in any one product before. It has an overpowering mildew smell, that is just not subsiding even after it has been airing out in the laundry room for 3 weeks."
1,Horrible!,They sent the wrong size and never answered any of the many emails I sent. Don't get taken like I did.
4,A Romantic Set Of Stories You Won't Want To Miss!!!,"To Tame a Viking is a book that includes two different stories about one family, a brother and a sister. The stories are romantic and fanciful and set in Scotland, Ireland, and Iceland.These were fast paced stories that were fun to read and entertaining. The chemistry and romance between the main characters Silke and Steel in ""Lord Steele"" was wonderful as was the romance between Aragon and Thora in ""Lady Thunder."" Ms. Burbank is a great author, and she gives attention to details that help place you in the time period that she is writing about. I look forward to reading more of her stories in the future!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The cover and summary made me rent this...such a waste of $1.99, its not worth that. I wouldn't even watch this again if it was free it was so bad."
4,Works like a charm,Easy to install and looks good on my white garage walls. It covered up all the old scrap marks too!
4,Nice product,"We had just the problem shown in the picture. You need to be real careful to mount the bumper at exactly the right place on the wall. But once you do it should end your problem of banging the door on the garage wall. It also blends in well, unlike some products. The same car probably needs to always be parked on the left side, because the location you install it needs to be different for each car."
3,Kinda small and no cushion,"It supposed to protect your vehicle but the material it very hard with very little give, and it's not very long requiring you to order several of them. Might be okay to protect your drywall but I believe it's to hard to protect your vehicle door."
3,It's okay,"Table was too small, and It had a few small defects. Because they were visible I had to return it."
3,Choose another Bob Movie- Too much arguing and yodeling,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves anything to do with Bob the Builder. The new characters Bennie and Zoomer are great and my son likes the Zoomer toy. This movie is really too long and negative for a child his age. It is a full length movie rather than several short episodes like the other Bob the Builder DVD's. Scoop spends most of the movie arguing with or criticizing the other machines. Here are a few examples of the dialogue -- -- ""We're here to work not to have fun,"" ""You're just a show off,"" ""You need to stop being such a know it all,"" etc. I believe they are trying to introduce the concept of teamwork, but I think it is introducing way too much corporate culture at such a young age. The yodeling may be very annoying for most as well. I would buy ""Dig, Lift and Haul"" instead of this movie."
4,What fun!,"I bought this toy for my two-year-old daughter, because she (we) has so much fun with her other Neurosmith toys. She was a bit young at the time, but likes it more now, a year later. We enjoy dancing around the living room-- even her one-year-old sister gets into the act! You do have to play with the sensitivity, but it's easy if you just follow the directions. I'm sad Neurosmith toys are going away... They help our kids become more musical, they're durable and attractive, they're versatile, and the sounds the toys make are NOT annoying! The best part: these days, you can get some good deals!"
1,Didn't know about the volume switch,Unfortunately I didn't know about the volume switch in the battery compartment. The music was so inaudible I ended up giving my 4 year old son's away. I don't think he spent more than two minutes playing with this toy. Be sure to check the volume feature out before purchasing or as soon as possible after purchasing so you have time to return this toy!
1,Don't know how it got high reviews,"We adjusted the sensitivity, didn't do much. My 2 yr old daughter prompted some sounds when she wacked the buttons. The reviews make this sound like a wonderful engaging toy. After the first 14 seconds of investigation my daughter turned to other things. I tried to return but Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days and I ordered it earlier as a gift and didn't bother opening it before that. Now I'm stuck with it, wasted my money, especially after spending money for additional cartridges, as well."
4,Reasonably priced good product,This is a great PDA and GPS receiver in one. I have been using this for 3 weeks and I love it. The only problem is that it requires a soft reset atleast twice a week (pda crashes). It provides routing and voice prompts. It does provide optimal routing 75% of the time. Overall good product.
4,Choose this as a reliable text or source book.,"Susan Au's history of ballet & modern dance is intelligent and authoritative. Where other narrative treatments often choose details seemingly randomly, Susan Au builds the narrative from the details she proffers. Nor does she lapse into odd anecdotes often found in other narrative treatments. This book corrects some errors that have been perpetuated in earlier encyclopedic volumes. I wish she had included a short section on antiquity, as I believe that some of the inspiration for and concepts in ""classical"" ballet and in early modern dance derive from the rediscovery of antiquity -- but this is just quibbling. If you are going to teach 19th and 20th century Western dance history, this is a reliable way to go."
4,Correction in progress,"CELEBRATIONS LIGHTING 34070-73 HALLOWEEN WINDOW DRAPE LIGHTS 50 LIGHT SETThe product was pictured and advertised with 36"" length but what was in the boxes was only 18"" long. It took several tries but a manager finally got involved and agreed to pay for the shipping to return the product. It seems the factory simply put the wrong product in the box. I am waiting for a full refund but they have assured me it will happen as soon as they receive the defective lights."
5,Another good book for SolidWorks,This the second of two good books that I have purchased from Planchard and Planchard in the past two months. I enjoy their step-by-step learning approach. They use graphic window screen shots and tool icons to help you in difficult design areas. They have you made real parts and assemblies. The book is easy to follow with the bold command logic. I would recommend this book to anyone new to SolidWorks
2,too big,"the only one problem for me,was the the boxers was too big for me,but by the other side everithing was o.k."
4,Mens Boxer Briefs,"These briefs are very nice and good quality, the price was also good. They are also more comfortable then many of the other brands I have tried in the past."
3,Happy cust.,"They came fast and I thought they looked great but washed once and stiching came out .... I want a replacement or refund on this item.. I ordered for my son and husband the pack I bought hubby didnt fall apart yetAMAZON has great customer service they replaced the defective pack right away.. Would buy again, I beleive this was just a defect in manufacturing."
4,Fun hack and slasher for the PS3,"I picked this game up used from Amazon.com... cost me all of $15 or so after shipping. It was more than worth it. Game play is fun, with lots of combos you can execute and the graphics/sound are good. The only downsides would be lack of good voice acting, and the storyline is only adequate. I guess you could compare this to something along the lines of the Diablo series. Pick up a weapon, and massacre! I'm not sure how much replay this game would have, but it's certainly worth a play-through or two..."
4,"Must have for the ""Hack n' Slash"" fan!","This game is sorely under-rated. You can run up to an enemy, take his sword out of his hands, chop his head off with it, and then throw it at another enemy's face....AWESOME. This game has decent graphics, the music is great, and the blood....yes...the blood. I love this game and if you like chopping hordes of enemies into mince meat, then you'll love it too.Occasionally there are a few glitches and bugs, but every game has em', and sometimes they can be funny(i.e. Enemy corpses going noodle all over the place xD).I was a bit disappointed to see that there was no multiplayer or some kind of ""Challenge Mode"", But over-all, this is a solid game and I recommend it to any action fan."
3,it's ok but it does its job,"The arrow rest on my bow wilted away, so I decided to go cheap and buy this since I plan on getting a new bow next year. The self-adhesive works pretty well, if you look close at the picture you'll see the metal piece the arrow rests on. that actually pivots. in the package it has an extra self-adhesive pad, and 2 extra little sleeves that go over the metal piece."
3,"A Hero, regardless...","I'm glad Mr. Weckstein wrote down his WWII memoirs. I wish that more veterans would follow his lead. There is much to learn about human nature & the privilege given to glimpse into the private hell of wartime active duty is a sacred trust. However, Mr. Weckstein's needed an experienced writer to make his story more palatable. He uses one recurring dream-sequence where he imagines his German counterpart which goes on & on... & on. I would have appreciated more reality about his comrades. To be sure, Mr. Weckstein is a hero with a story that must be told. However, there are better 1st person WWII narratives."
4,Story of an ordinary guy's exraordinary experiences in WW2,This is an incredibly exciting story of a average young man who goes through unbelievable war time situations and comes out of them unscathed. He describes his accomplishments with humlity that makes this book very readable. He is responsible for the preservation of one of the world's architectural treasures. This took great courage and he explains it vividly. I strongly recommend this book if you want a down-to-earth explaination of what the infantry went through in WWII
4,Good for younger families and the recipes are delish,I've subscribed to Canadian Living for almost 20 years after reading a copy while visiting Canada. The magazine offers plenty of parenting tips (great for young families) and lots of delicious recipes.
1,AWFUL!!!!,"I was born in Kuala Lumpur and planning a trip there later this year. I bought this movie to help my boyfriend understand where I'm from since he will be going as well and I wanted him to get a taste of what he'll see when he goes to KL. This movie spends about 5 minutes total on Kuala Lumpur. He visits the obvious landmarks (the biggest buildings you can see) but doesn't tell you how to get around, hidden jems, where to shop, etc... He doesn't even explain the different parts of town like Chinatown or Indian town. He proceeds to go to the island of Borneo and play in the water. The title of this DVD is Kuala Lumpur, not Kuala Lumpur and all Borneo. Also, his interview with some guy at Putrajaya was awful. He pretty much repeated what was said on the back of the dvd case."
3,Garden Mattock handle,"The pictures on site made this appear exactly like the handle that had been broken. But, instead of being round where the handle fits into the head, this product was rectangular. We simply cannot use it! Waste of money."
1,Can you judge a book by its cover?,"As a USAFA grad and AF pilot, I would like to point out that the cover photo is of a Tornado. A jet that is not in the US inventory, nor has ever been. I would recommend going to the Academy website for error free information."
3,Easy Read,"This book was easy to read. I didn't enjoy it as much as other Catherine Cookson novels, it wasn't as descriptive."
4,Good,"All I have to say is this is good, dark, inspiring music. But I'm a fan of metal so it's not something I'd wanna listen to all the time."
5,love this game just as mutch as the first,"this game is twice as long as the first and twice as funny, you dont have to completly start all over when get killed in a mission like the first, there is so mutch to do and is so cool to be based in the 60s,this game is just great and the conversation paths are endless were u get to choose what crypto says to people, there were some changes in this game that took some getting used to but it all works out."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big Doors fan & collector and was very disappointed with this documentary. In fact, there was very little I liked about it, other than perhaps the nice quality of the HWY clips and some others. There's virtually nothing new in the ""rare"" clips used, which the director was hyped as given ""access to the Doors archives"".The narrative was laughable at times and missed so much. As mentioned in another review, there were so many other people that should have interviewed for this film, who could have offered some real insight into the band and their activities at the time.Rating: 2/5"
4,Doors Docs & Depp,"When You're Strange / A film about The Doors / A film by Tom Dicillo / Narrated by Johnny Depp: This is not a concert film. This is not a `rarities' junk drawer. This is a well made documentary about The Doors (Well, actually, it's about Jim being IN The Doors). As a documentary, it is very good. No, it doesn't break any new ground. There's not that much new ground left! It does its job of presenting the story and it does it VERY well. It is like listening to an old Doors album, you know the material, but it's still a treat to experience it again. Johnny Depp does the narration. He does it very well. Depp has done this kind of thing before, previously working on the film ""The Source"" about the Beat Generation poets, so he handles the job as expected. If you're a Doors fan, you'll get this film. If you're curious about The Doors, this is the film to see. If you don't like the Doors, you're not reading this review. As a documentary, I like it, so it gets four stars."
2,Have you seen The Doors movie? Don't need to waste time on this one.,"I base this review on the fact that I've seen Oliver Stone'sThe Doors (Special Edition).This movie adds basically nothing relevant to the former movie. Yes it has some very good quality original footage (at least previously unseen to me) and great Doors songs excerpts.However this is meant to be a biographical documentary yet it fails to provide a detailed biography.In fact I'll take it a step further: Oliver Stone's The Doors movie has more biographical data than this documentary. It lacks for instance detail on Pam (Morrison's lifetime girlfriend) and several relevant experiences which shaped Morrison.Bottom line: If you're a serious Doors fan and are in the mood of listening to your fave Doors songs while watching something on the screen, then you could get this documentary. Otherwise don't bother!"
2,Impossible Pump,"Unfortunately the pump that came with this product does not work. It is a tube that you are supposed to pump into the small hole in this huge ball. The mat was acceptable,but I wont be able to do all the exercises I wanted to without the ball"
2,The ole Karmal aint what it use to be,"Don't know if I received old boxes or if the ingredients have somehow changed but this use to be an absolute, to die for candy choice of mine but I was disappointed in the 2 boxes I bought. The taste/consistency doesn't seem the same, not as rich in flavor. However, still ok good, but wouldn't bother ordering anymore... lost some of its original WOW somehow."
1,look elsewhere,"First off, the reason I bought the book is because it's required text for a Maya class I'm taking and the instructors decided on this book before it's release - big mistake! This book is loaded with inaccurate, vague or mislabeled information and the DVD isn't much better, in one of the DVD tutorials the instructor stops and backtracks several times because his ""script"" is off. Please save yourself the complete frustration if you are learning Maya, and look elsewhere for something more helpful."
5,They were having fun,"I got this book as a gift but flipped through the pages before wrapping it. The gift recipient is a big fan of Dave Draper and Arnold and all the rest and just LOVED it. A lotta fun to read. Great pics, too."
4,Blacks Law Dictionary,I bought the book to get a view of how the legal system sees us. Was surprised at some of the definitions.
3,"Perfect for children, not adults","Would be nice to be able to tell whether such books are intended for the the understanding of children, so that we could make the right choice. This would be a great gift for a child."
3,"Cute, but only that","This romantic comedy that is a remake of My Best Friend's Wedding (Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz) is cute, but fails to entertain you, except for the songs and the humour in the racy song 'Sharara Sharara'. Only see this if you are really bored or want a rather dry taste to Bollywood."
5,What a Fabulous Book!,"Clan Ground is a fabulous book, and is worth taking time to read. I enjoyed it a ton, and if you like to read books about animals, this is a wonderful choice!"
1,Lectors guide to Biblical Pronunciations,"Very displeased...Never got book, have told them many times, they suggested I go to the post office, I did and no luck. Still haven't gotten the book. Was told that a new one would be sent... again no luck!"
3,"OK, but not their best",I bought this one to add to my Angel collection and I liked it for awhile but then I got sick of it. The lyrics didn't make any sense at all with all that Esu Zaza-Absu or something or other. If you're a true fan of Morbid Angel go ahead and buy it but don't get it if you want to hear them for the first time.
3,Great percussion and boring guitar solos,"The first five tracks of this album are absolutely awesome. There is a wicked flow between the whirlwind drums of Pete Sandoval, who definately reaches the heights of previous works, and the deep felt guitar play. But after ""Disturbance in the Great Slumber"" Trey's guitar seems to be the focus of the album, and that is a shame. Listening to tracks like ""Covenant of Death"" and ""Umalamari"" one wonders how Sandoval accepts playing such boring drums! It seems, all in all, that Morbid Angel has travelled from being an integrated collective band to fulfilling the solo ambitions of Trey Azagthoth.By the way: Being a student of Near Eastern Archaeology, one can't help feeling that Trey's use of Mesopotamian mythology is quite ridiculous."
1,Not the revised 1957 edition,Beware of nonstandard editions of this classic. The 1957 revised edition lists Hille & Phillips as co-authors and runs to over 800 pages.
4,Bill is Right on about Bush!!!,Not Bills Best but still hilarious and so on target about Bush! I would agree...he is brutally honest and politically up front! Worth owning! You won't be sorry and you'll get your money's worth in laughter.
5,Hysterical,I love Bill Maher and this stand up was one of his best yet!Makes you think and laugh at the same time.
5,Truly outstanding mystery,"This is clearly a cut above, coincidently read in the year that the inventor of fractal mathematics, Benoit Mandelbrot, died. Fractals are well explained in passing but it is by no means necessary to understand them in order to enjoy this superb mystery. The exposition is first rate, and alluding to such things as the Group W bench adds spice for those of us who recognize the references (which sometimes I didn't). Best of all -- and the most important characteristic of a good whodunit -- the clues are there to figure out the culprit's identity and one kicks oneself for having failed to do so."
5,Great Read!,"I want to start out saying I got this book free in a promotion, so I didn't have to pay for it. However, I LOVED it, so I have ordered his next book which I did pay for!The character is great, flawed, and more real than many of the main characters in this genre. It made it really interesting and fun. They mystery was great, I didn't have it figured out, and the premise was new and different. All in all, a fun, interesting and great book. Welcome to the mystery genre Mr. Cohen, I look forward to many more reading experiences with Pepper Keane."
3,If they gave Bruce Bill's Role and Bill Bruce's role the movie would have been much better.,"This movie would have been much better with Bruce Campbell in the lead and Bill Campbell playing the smaller role. Bill didn't impress me in this movie, and I normally like his films. Bruce has little time on film in this one, but his was enjoyable as always to watch."
1,This product is not built to last,I've seen similar reviews on this product....that the top heating element fails within about a year's time. This is a design flaw. I've also heard that there is no way to get a replacement part.I would not recommend this product unless you want a toaster oven that only lasts about a year.
2,Not my favorite glasses,"These glasses fit very close to the eyes, so I was always feeling my eyelashes hit them. They are very dark, so much so that I was getting glare in the inside making it hard to see. While I admit I am hard on my glasses, these scraped off the mirrored surface (right where my eyes hit) very quickly.Were not to expensive, but I don't think these made it more that two months for me."
2,1950s Fashion Sourcebook,I was disappointed with the poor illustrations in this book. They didn't do justice to the fashions of that wonderful decade.
3,Not His Best!,"Whether you like this or not will largely depend upon what your expectations are from TC. For me, I like TC's blues music with a touch of soul, bordering on James Brown. My expectations were met with the Grammy award winning Right as Rain. But this is not it and for me the CD is merely all right. On this disc Castro leans towards the sixty's R&B music and the songs bring to mind the Temptations and the Supremes rather than Muddy Waters or John Lee Hooker. Like Jonny Lang on his latest release, Castro tries to spread out to a broader group and, in my opinion, falls a little short. Castro is best seen live and maybe in that setting can do these songs some justice. Some times it is best just to stick to the formula and fan base that got you there. Castro is a little off the path."
2,Quite A Disappointment,"With all due respect to the previous reviewer, when he stated, ""If you are a Tommy Castro fan, You'll love this cd.."" Im sorry to say, i Did Not like this cd at all...Sure there are a couple of songs, that are really good, but this Blindpig effort has way too many cooks in the stew...To diminish Tommy's guitar and powerful vocals is a mistake. The supporting musicians, and singers are all very great artists in their own..but to me it only dilluted the talents of Randy McDonald, and Chris Sandoval, and the ""Known Castro Signature Sound""...I was lucky, my girlfriend preordered this cd, and i received a personal autographed copy by Tommy, which was so cool. But, you know what..? After 15 years of non stop touring, and 300 dates a year, Tommy deserves to put out what he desires..I only hope the next Blindpig Tommy Castro cd takes us all back to his killer hip shaking rock and soul sound...!!"
3,"Fun, but not that great","I got these for laughs, mainly, and that is what they are for. The shot glass is thick and melts quickly. I forgot one on the table after ""putting it down"" and it melted, obviously.The disappointment stems from the shape of the glass you consistently get. We've managed one set of decent ones and a number of crooked and awkwardly shaped figures. Now, we do it by layers. I 1/3 of an inch at a time.It's a fun party item and a good gift, but you can live without it easily and save the $7."
2,Not nearly as cool as they seem.,"I was really stoked about these, and bought four trays to make enough for a party. However, apparently it wasn't taken into account that water expands as it freezes, so ALL of the 48 glasses that I made ended up with a ""bulge"" where the silicone rubber expanded into the glass, preventing them from even holding a full shot. Also, due to this same issue, the ""bottom"" of the glass had to then be melted down manually to make the glasses able to stand upright. If you want something that's kinda corny and fun for a one-time deal, and don't mind spending the money, go for it. If you intend to use these regularly at parties or in your home bar, I'd recommend a pass. Go with something that's maybe a little more sturdy to create the shape."
5,Pretty Cool,"I bought two of these. One was a secret santa gift and the other for personal use. For the one I gifted, he sent me pictures of the final product and they looked great. He took some of those pixie stix and mixed it with the water which made colorful glasses that seemed to melt slower than the water-only ones. For me, I made some out of orange juice which were used for vodka shots and later dropped in a glass with vodka in it. Don't expect to take more than a couple back to back shots with this because they melt rather quickly. What seems to work best is taking the shot and using the glass as ice for your next drink. Enjoy."
3,As stated a million times already. A good novelty.,"Pros:-Works great as a shot glass and you can make many of them for a more entertaining evening.-Plenty of room between the bottom of the ice glass and the bottom of the inside liquid to prevent leakage.Cons:-Good only for a couple of shots-Can't really set them down anywhere because they'll get the surfaces wet. Careful where you guests leave em.-When opening the box initially, this thing STUNK with chemicals. Even after rinsing several times, smell didn't go away. I suggest making the shot glasses and popping them out after no more than 24 hours in the freezer. Just pop em out and flip em upside down in the freezer so no dust get's in.Other items:-They are kinda hard to pop out each one out but that's not really something big enough to be a con unless your making 100's of these."
4,Jagermeister companion,"Took a couple tries to produce nice molds (get them bubbles out before freezing!), but well worth the effort. Makes for a memorable BBQ when you show up with a bottle of Jager and a dozen ice glasses!"
4,Makes a cool shot glass for parties,Used these a my party & it was a instant hit! Def should buy these. Just wish there was more then 4
3,Beckham: My World - Damaged cover,Item shipped with other items and book cover was damaged - did not care for this at all but I see it happening more and more - book wasn't even protected in any way from the boxed dvd sets (3) - so picture the damage that was done - will think twice in future.
2,meh.,I miss chocolate fragrance. I can't believe they discontinued it. Didn't like pink sugar. too strong.Will not buy again.
5,LOVE FOR LAMPLIGHTER'S!!!,we recently discovered lamplighter books and are slowly growing our collection. it is a small book that dads read to their daughters and print a little message inside to his daughter. this is one that you get for each daughter
4,An unusually good movie,Maybe the only flaw with the movie is its title and cover. Viewers may expect a snappy comedic romp rather than the personal odyssey film that it is. Maybe that explains the negative reviews. I agree whole-heartedly with the two four-star reviews written below.
1,Disppointing quality,"I won't go into the story, plot or anything like that. There are plenty of those around. My review is specifially for the Blu-Ray product itself. In a word, it sucks. This is nothing more than a VHS copy in Blu-Ray format. Whoever made this put in little effort, and this is clearly not a ""remastering"" in any sense of the word. The video quality is as grainy as a VHS copy.The special features include a segment from a British series called The Electric Theater Show, which discussed the making of, Who Dares Wins.The movie itself is fine, just don't expect stunning (or if your'e using HD as your benchmark ... good) quality."
2,The Man Who Mistook His Wife for A Hat. Lost in Translation,"I was extremely disappointed that the audio was not read by Dr. Sacks himself. I have an old recording on an old cassette with him reading and it was so much better. If there is a dvd of his own voice reading, I would buy it in a New York minute!Something was lost in having an American accent doing an Englishman's performance. You asked for a comment. I hope it helped."
3,a bit disappointing...,"This book definitely had a fascinating collection of anecdotes but at the end of each story, I felt I was left hanging."
3,"Go back to Rescuing Babies, Yoshi","When I first got this game, I thought it was great and couldn't put it down. As I got further, I felt that this game was just too repetitive. The control scheme is creative, but hard to get the hang of. At the beginning of the game, the missions are a piece of cake. At the end however, they get difficult and frusturating. I think Yoshi is better at rescuing babies than bringing happiness back to the world. I understand how some people will like this game a lot, but i would try it out somehow before you buy it so you won't be disappointed with game. At the beginning this game is a blast, but like many Yoshi games it turns into bore. Yoshi Topsy-Turvy has a lot of room for improvement."
3,it was okay,"First I would like to say that I do like Sylvia's book and stuff. And I always loved Sylvia's sprit guide Francine. But what upset me in this book was the fact that it was really hard to relate to Francine. She barely mentioned herself. I was hoping that she would talk about her incarnation and use that as examples and stuff, but she didn't mention it once. I just thought it was also boring and hard to relate to. I thought it could have been a lot better."
5,Conversations with the Other Side,"If you are tuned into your insticts(Soul) and listen to it, then read this book and you will know in your Soul, it's the truth!"
1,not worth the time,"I have read many of the Metaphysical authors books, and have to say this is the first time I felt like the info wasn't legit. Of course, some books will resonate with some people, others with other people, but I truly felt that this was all just not valid. There were too many inconsistancies with other authors, and with my own beliefs.Wondering whether it was just me, I looked to see who recommended the book on the back jacket etc, and didn't see any one I was familiar with."
2,Qui est l'auteur ??,"Je ne suis pas une très ancienne ""fan"" de Mme Browne, je n'ai lu que 2 autres de ses livres. J'ai été surprise de réaliser que le texte avait été ""dicté"" mais j'aurais d y penser peut-tre. Il y a quelques bonnes idées pour les méditations. La description du ""ciel"" semble tre du déjà vu...ou bien est-ce ma perception..Je ne crois pas continuer avec cette auteur."
4,Conversations with the other side,"Very insightful. A strong hearted individual finds it inspiring, but a weak heart person finds it overwhelming. It eases the curiosity on the other side as we try to make sense on this side of the physical world."
2,Conversations with the other side,"As a ""fan"" of Sylvia Browne's teachings I always look forward to her books. Though alot of information is repetitive from book to book, I've always walked away with something new. This book, however, though comforting and lovely, is more than repetitive. Told by Franince, it bears the exact same information as Life on the Other side and The Other side and back. Sorry to disappoint, but old ""fans"" if you've read the other books I mentioned, then you've read this one. For new fans, it is a must, compact knowledge in a paper back about this life and the after."
2,Sylvia Brown really does believe in reincarnation...,"for her books, too! She continues to use the same information over and over but just slaps a different title on it and, WHAM!, she has a new book. I used to love Sylvia Brown's works but now I'm getting a bit cynical about it. Is there nothing else to know? Is that all there is? Is there nothing new she can add? I've found paragraphs and even whole chapters in later books that have been reused word for word from an earlier book. When I've bought a new book hoping for new information and find entire chapters ripped off from a book I already own, I feel cheated, swindled and robbed. Also, all of her books get pumped out so fast and furious that I wonder about the care and quality of the information that went into them. I rate this as two stars because I feel the information is valuable. It's just too bad that old fans don't get anything new from it."
1,The authors,"Hmmm, I guess Francine, Sylvia's familiar spirit wants some of the credit, Sylvia is taking up most of the spotlight and the dollar bills.....Ever see her webpage $700 just for a reading, well I guess you can say that Francine has her soul and that is priceless and for Sylvia just take out your Mastercard. Sylvia, how much does Montel Williams pay you to do his show and why not any follow ups on the ""Readings"" you give people?This book should be called 'Conversations With the Other Side with the Demon World by Francine' because this is where the information is coming from.It saddens me to see people giving her such props and glory...People can be so blind and gullable....Seek the Lord He is the truth."
5,"Intelligence, wisdom, beauty","Zbigniew Herbert (died 1998) is counted among the finest poets of 20th century Poland, on a par with Szymborska and Milosz, world-famous Nobel Prize winners. This book of essays is a record of his journeys in France, Italy and the Netherlands: from the rock-paintings of Lascaux, through the medieval architecture of the great cathedrals, to the quiet consummate perfection of the Flemmish Masters. The rich meditation on art and life is your reward for joining the eccentric and humane poet with his 19th century Baedekker guide."
3,Very opiniated book,"I didnt feel comfortable with author's personality present in every sentence - I found a lot of times he finds examples to support his point of view and ommits the dociments that prove him wrong. I tried to read this book keeping it in mind and make my own judgements ( cause the book is full of them - some right, some wrong) But the last two chapters on USSR and Russians abroad were brilliant."
2,Beware of battery life!!!!,"Don't buy tool, batteries last for only one year. I purchased this tool one year ago from amazon along with a makita thats working and charging just fine. I now have a Milwaukee drill and saw that are paper weights!!!"
4,David Lynn Jones,Excellent CD. David Lynn Jones is one of the more vesrsitle singers around. I don't understand why he isn't better known.
2,Henna bottle,This item is very tiny. And hard to work with. The bottle is so narrow its incredibly difficult to get the henna in the bottle. Also its even more difficult to squeeze the henna out of the bottle because of how narrow the tube is. And with shipping and everything this is going to cost you 12 dollars for a small bottle. Its better to buy the henna tubes instead of bottles. Dont buy this its A Rip OFF!!
5,Loved it!,Bought this for my teenage daughter - she really enjoyed it! She would like to get the other seasons soon
5,Pretty little liars DVD,My DVD came in the mail very quickly and was wrapped with care. It was exactly what I was looking for
1,Faulty Disk,"This is the first time since I have been an Amazon member, that I have received a bad product. I ordered this season, brand new still in the shrink wrap, for my sister for Christmas and when she began watching it, she found that one of the disks would skip and refused to bring up the menu. She was forced to skip several episodes due to this."
5,Pretty Little Liars DVD,very satisfied with this product. came exactly as described and in a timely fashion. ordered as like new and it came with the plastic still on it
4,Excellent Mystery/Suspense Show!,"I just finished watching the first season of PLL and I am hooked! The show follows four high school girls who are being haunted by a mysterious person, ""A."" A year before the show starts, their best friend Alison disappeared suddenly and is presumed dead. Though the girls drift apart the following summer, they are reunited when they start receiving threatening texts and messages from ""A."" He or she seems to know every secret about Alison and the girls, though it's unclear what ""A"" wants. While they deal with that central mystery, the girls also struggle with family and relationship issues. My only caveat was that though the girls seem pretty intelligent, sometimes they behave in really idiotic ways when the threat of ""A"" is nearby. For example, they don't lock their doors or tell the police when they're being threatened. That seemed a little unrealistic to me. But I am looking forward to watching the second season to see if they reveal who the mysterious ""A"" is!"
1,Great Show...Horrible Video Quality,"Warning: Buy the HD episodes! Don't waste your money on these ones. I can't believe Amazon charges $1.99 for these horrible quality videos! Other than that, the show is great :) But you'll enjoy it much better in HD."
4,"I'm probably not their target audience, but...","I was instantly addicted to this teen soap melodrama. I'll start off by saying that I have not read the books. That being said, this show is not ""amazing"" or ""incredible"". It is what it is & it doesn't take itself too seriously. What this show is is pure fun. Suspenseful, addicting, my guilty pleasure. While this show might not be everybody's cup of coffee, this show will please those who are fond of the (young) mystery genre. Some content might raise a few parents' eye brows, but let's be honest, it was never meant for ""family friendly viewing""."
3,ROSEMARY'S BABY WITH A TWIST,THIS CREEPY MELLODRAMA STARS BARBARA EDEN AS A WOMAN WHO IS PREGNANT BUT HER HUSBAND WHO HAD A VASECTOMY COULFN'T POSSIBLYBE THE FATHER THEREFORE WHO IS? WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAYTHINK ROSEMARY'S BABY MEETS ALIEN
5,obscure but amazing Romero film,"This is probably one of George Romero's lesser known films, but I think it's one of his best(he has also said it's one of his favorites). It's about a young man who may or may not be a vampire, and his struggle to find a place for himself....To say more would spoil the movie,which I won't do. I recommend tracking down Anchor Bay's 1999 release, which contains the original full-screen format of the film AND a John Amplas commentary. The 2004 Lion's Gate release is an artificially created widescreen(which actually removes more of the image), and no longer contains the Amplas commentary. Romero completists like me will probably just end up buying both versions. ;)"
5,THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER,"George A. Romero's Martin is without a doubt in my opinion the BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! It stars John Amplas (in his first film) as Martin. He is a vampire, but not like the kind you see in the movies, he uses a razor blade to slit women's wrists and drink their blood. I don't want to get into to much of the film but I strongly suggest you get this film! And for all you fans of MARTIN that haven't gotten the Collector's Edition or HAVE it, I have to tell you something.... It doesn't say this on the box, but if you wait after the film itself is over about 30 seconds or so, there is a theatrical trailer!!! If you hadn't already know that and you see it please e-mail me and let me know."
2,"Disappointment, I'm afraid...","Not such an interesting movie after all, and not a very good transfer to DVD. Sure, the subject gets an intelligent treatment, but it's definitely not scary, and not a movie to watch twice. I was deeply disappointed, especially because of the huge amount of [positive comments]."
3,Ouch!,"I like this brush because it doesn't have that plastic plate that some brushes have. Unfortunately, the bristles are crazy stiff! After many uses on my feet (the only skin tough enough to handle this brush) it's still very firm. The base is cracking already as well, which is a drag."
3,Body brush,This brush is harder than I wanted.Good for dry body but I wanted a softer bristle for full body washing.
3,GOOD FOR KIDS,"WE HAVE SEEN MARK LOWRY IN PERSON 2 TIMES AND HE HAS MATURED ,THESE EARLIER WORKS ARE GOOD FOR THE KIDS."
1,Burned,"We never even plugged it in. We bought the heater for a bathroom, but when we read the manual it stated very clearly that it is not suitable for use in a bathroom. So, we returned it at our expense & received a refund, less a 10% restocking fee. We lost about 25% of our money. The real cause of the problem was lack of info in the online product description. We would not buy any product made by this company again. Also, the vendor was very difficult to deal with, but evently agreed to let us return the heater."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I am a big Lorenzo Lamas fan.. but this is a bomb.... I could not watch it anymore... Lamas with a Russian accent.. funny to say the least..Pathetic acting, and the movie looks like it cost $20 to make.Avoid this one!"
4,Let Freedom Ring,"An interesting blend of stock footage and filmed, this is the fascinating true story of the Cincinnati art director who defied everyone and everything to show the controversial photography of Maplethorpe. As a person who was living in Cincinnati at the time of the trial's conclusion, I must say this film did capture the essence of the city's reaction. A Jeckyl/Hyde town, Cincinnati is staunchly conservitive during it's sheriff Simon Leis ruled days; but turns into ""Sin""-cinatti at night, a liberal artistic town. These two sides clashed vehemently over the Maplethorpe issue, in fact, it is still a hot topic, 10 years later. The film is an important one in that it reminds us that we must continue to uphold our freedoms and rights, especially the freedom of expression. We all have a right to our own art, and we all have a right to chose what to view; we do not have a right to dictate to others what is and is not art or a viable expression. That is what this film is about."
5,"So easy to follow, even I didn't get lost.","I'm geographically challenged so I was a little nervous about using these guides, but I got them as a present before my trip so I knew I had to try at least one. Well, I have many wonderful memories of my week in Paris, but the best ones came on the (four) walks I did have a chance to take. They made it easy for me to have unforgettable experiences."
3,good book/not really a killer/could be of great help though,"***Most tips in this book are OK, but not by any means 'killer'.I found some great tips, but I also found lots of common sense and not so useful advices - wondering why were they called 'tips' after all.***The guy is funny and the reading is really entertaining,... but is that really what people should expect from a collection of 'killer tips'?***I think the book could be more efficient, and less `blah blah blah ha ha ha wasn't this funny?' would help with that.***It would be nice if the author would cut to the chase and in LESS words and MORE advices (tips), make this book a real killer, and a real must-have on the shelf of any Maya artist.***Last, but not least, this book can actually be of great help to some...:)"
1,A Hole In The World Review,"This was a rather short book but not very exciting. It was a long time before you actually figured out the reason for Paul being sent to the farm, which made it very hard to grab my attention and keep me interested. The book did have a good message to the story of the power of your words and integrity, however it did seem to go into some things that did not appear to deal with the story in many ways. If you read it with a group that does not think alike, it can become a controversial book with some of the topics. If you have the opportunity, chose another book to read. I only gave it a one star because you were forced to rate it, personally out of five stars I would give it a zero."
3,"Focus, Vince. Focus!","I have to chime in and agree with what most people are saying here. When he sticks to the point of the book, which is that the Supreme Court erred when it let the Paula Jones lawsuit proceed while President Clinton was still in office, this book is excellent. However, Mr. Bugliosi wants us to believe that this is merely an example of a whole society that's gone ""insane"" (using rap music, Ivan Lendl, and navel piercing in support of his argument). Hello? Is there an editor in the house? Bugliosi or his editor or someone should have made him stick with the Court's decision and left the rantings to letters to the editors. Fortunately, the book's not that long so it's a quick read. I'd recommend skipping the first section, though, which is just an irrelevant screed."
4,Interesting,"Good book, makes you think of how ridiculous things are in the states with regard to litigation. One wonders if this case interrupted Clinton s presidency enough to distract him from perhaps eliminating the master mind of 9/11 -> namely osama bin laden, since he did have a chance to assasinate him at one point."
4,mildly interesting,"I didn't find this as enthralling as some other reviewers did, but it still had some nice little words of Torah. The early part of the book was most interesting; Kugel explains that while we think of God as very abstract and very far away, the Bible sometimes shows him suddenly appearing in human form as an angel, going out of its way to blur the distinction between God and other beings. By contrast, later texts tend to more sharply distinguish God and angels from each other and from beings with bodies.Kugel also explains that while moderns think of man searching for God, the Bible shows God in search of Man (to use R. Heschel's phrase) - often without any indication that the human being contacted has sought such contact. (Though many Midrashim try to show otherwise, indicating some discontent with the idea of unsought prophecy).As Kugel points out, ""As the biblical period goes on, God becomes bigger and more remote (p. 61). . . ungraspably big and far off (p. 63). What changed?"
5,This book is awesome!,"I love, love, love this book. Little crafts and ideas for each season of the year. Such a great resource. It has really helped me make the transition into a more waldorf/natural lifestyle especially when it comes to holidays. I especially love the Christmas/advent celebration ideas. So wonderful. If you are going to buy one craft book, make this the one!"
1,Kid's book,"This book was a waste of time, it just talked about basic dog behavior, with simple language. No detail whatsoever on how to train or specific tricks to teach your dog. The book's title should be ""Rottweiler Children Stories."""
2,Dry and Disappointing,"I've read all of HJ's fiction, his Notebooks, Prefaces, Letters, travel writing and a shelf of biographies and I'm finding this book lifeless and ""studied."" It does not animate HJ, but makes him a waxwork--I found the (fairly) recent biography of HJ in relation to Fenimore and Minnie far livelier and better written. It's being hyped to the stars, but does not live up to the hype, and if you read the long NYTBR review carefully, the reviewer there isn't wild about it either, noting its mechanical quality and its anachronistic view of HJ."
3,"not as good as Lodge's ""Author, Author""","This novel (and it IS a novel, though it focuses on the life of Henry James) has some good moments, perhaps even a lot of good moments. However, it lacks unity, and Toibin stoops to triteness in his handling of the ending. I recommend, instead (or in addition), reading David Lodge's novel, ""Author, Author,"" which oddly enough is another fictionalized biography of James published at about the same time."
2,Not the best,"I will not order these again. I was hoping they would be good but the colored one is so faded, not bright , very faded."
1,These don't work!!,"1 black ink cartridge worked for a short time on my Canon MP460 printer, the other did not. Both color did not work either."
1,Not happy with color quality,"I read the reviews and felt it was worth a try. I will not purchase again. The black was fine but the color looks terrible. I had purchased 2 black and 2 color. The first color cartridge I tried would not print green very well. Colors looked more yellow than green. After using that cartridge for a while (it lasted about 1/2 as long as cannon cartridges), I replaced it with the second color cartridge. That one would not print green or blue at all. I suggest that if you want color, either spend the extra money and buy from cannon or try another replacement cartridge company."
2,Not so happy,"I received two Color and two black well my printer wouldn't except the first color one but it did on the second one and I haven 't tried the black yet but I 'm not to happy with the ""good deal "" I got."
5,Excellent service,I had a problem with one of the cartridges and the vendor was very responsive and resolved my issue quickly.I will definitely do business with this vendor again
1,Ink Cartridges CL-41 & PG-40,I have used this product before and they were find. This pair however were very poor. Washed out colors and are empty already after very little printing. I would not recommend this product nor would I purchase them again.
1,Terrible,Do not buy them. They will not work in your printer. I have spent many hours of research on how to reset the printer and nothing works. Worst money ever spent.
2,Do you have bad knees & hips? This DVD is PERFECT!,"I recently started Weight Watchers and thought buying a workout DVD would be a good thing to do since I'm a junior in college and barely have time to go to the gym. I'm 5'9 290lbs so I didn't want to start anything too extreme. I was not pleased with this DVD only because it doesn't challenge me. Although the DVD says LOW IMPACT, its too low for me. This is a DVD for people who are like 500lbs and have never worked out before or people who have back, hip, or knee problems. This DVD is PERFECT for you. If you're looking for something more intense, this DVD is NOT for you."
4,Fact Correction,"To correct a previous review: THE BIG TIME was originally published in 1961. CABARET was first produced in 1966. While the book may be about time travel, it's unlikely that Leiber actually ENGAGED in time travel in order to rip off the plot of a musical in order to write it."
3,Kindle Formatting Issues,"I'm not going to review the book as a book; I'm going to look at the issues with the version being given away for the Kindle. There are some formatting issues which get in the way of enjoying the book.First, the quote at the beginning of the book is chopped off at the right hand margin. On my Kindle, fourth font size, it reads as follows""You can't know there's a ware on--fSnakes coil and Spiders weave to keep yoknowing it's being fought over your lidead body!If you go to the smallest font size, it goes down to two lines, but still the right margin is truncated. My guess is that the quote has a negative margin setting.No Table of ContentsThe Five Way Control doesn't let you skip from one section to another since there are no sections defined in the bar at the bottom of the screen.It doesn't take all that long to do a halfway decent job of formatting a book. Since this is the only Kindle version available for this book, it would be nice if someone had taken the hour to do so."
3,Nice Holster!,"In my opinion it is slightly over priced and it wraps the pistol rather tight..... I have left my Glock 19 in it for 2 weeks now hoping it would for the holster and wouldn't be uch a tight fit... so far it seems to be breaking in well. However, you may get some holster wear if your not careful! Also, my glock is top heavy in this holster... it seems to bounce on my leg, I am assuming I need to purchase the strap to use with the holster to keep everything in place. i don't understand why they wouldn't just include it with the holster!"
3,Sending it back,"Read reviews and saw the you tube reviews. Thought it would be great, but it slips. Really sticks out also. 19 fits in the holster though."
4,Industry leader,"The whole line of Kreg pocket hole screws is excellent. I've used off-brands and they don't compare. The only downside in this particular size, is that a 1-inch screw is used to attach a plywood side to a dadoed face frame, and it only comes in a pan head. If it were a washer head like the coarse thread screws, it would be less likely to draw through ""soft spots"" in the plywood and poking out the front of your face frame."
4,Good book!,"The literature used in statistics' courses has long been dominated by either too advanced books, or too simple ones.Estadistica Matematicas Con Aplicaciones is in between.Who is this book for? First of all, it is essential reading for undergraduate students who wish to understand some practical techniques in statistics and their mathematical concepts.Second, it is essential reading for practitioners who carry on statistical analysis and may want to have different mathematical and statistical tools available."
1,Poorly made show,"We had never watched this show when it originally aired, but since we enjoyed the Bob Newhart Show so much, we thought we'd give it a try. Mistake. Ugh. Poorly acted. It is videotaped instead of filmed. Poorly written. Need I go on? Maybe it got better as time went on, but we weren't willing to give it a chance. We gave this away."
5,"Great, Classic Humor","For anyone that can appreciate Bob Newhart's style of humor, Newhart is a wonderful show. The first season has some different characters than the later seasons have, i.e. Leslie VanderKellen, as the inn's housekeeper, and Kirk DeVane, who runs the cafe next door. George Utley, as the resident handyman, is a pretty strong character right from the beginning. Larry and the two Darryls appear in a few episodes; thankfully, they'll appear more prominently in later seasons. There seems to be great chemistry between Bob Newhart, Mary Frann (Joanna), and Tom Poston (George) in these early episodes. My only complaint is that I wish the other seasons were also on DVD! In the meantime, it is fun to see how things began in the Vermont inn, with some interesting characters."
3,Engaging humorous characters well developed,"Sometimes I feel like I need to escape from the frenetic pace of life in the 21st century, and this helps me achieve that escape. This is not Citizen Kane. The humor is simple but genuine, the characters are nonthreatening, and the plots are sometimes predictable, but this is still a great time capsule to a much simpler time in our lives. I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially since I grew up in a tiny town full of characters as well. This is (or was) what the real America is like."
5,olé Pistoulet!,"I searched for dinnerware everywhere for two months before selecting Pistoulet as my pattern. I was confident of its quality being it's made by Pfaltzgraff. But mainly I was delighted by the fun patterns and different colors used in all the pieces. Most of them tie together color-wise one way or another. (There are a few pieces that don't really match, but they still look good with the other pieces.) The edge shape of the dinner and dessert plates are very pretty and classy. The coffee mugs are just the perfect size and look totally adorable on the small Saucer/Dessert Plates.I am thrilled with the huge assortment of unique Pistoulet accessories and have so many favorites. Pfaltzgraff representatives have assured me that as this is one of their most popular patterns, pieces should be available for some time to come."
2,"Several dented, leaking cans made for a messy package.",I ordered this because I was having dental surgery and had to have a liquid diet. I used this producy years ago when I had braces for 3 years and eating was messy and complicated. I particulary liked the taste and that it came in a metal can that could be well chilled.Now the product comes in a cardboard sided container that crushes easily in the post. The taste is now cloying and coats your mouth. Awful. Won' buy again.
2,Quite disappointed,"I love Ratatouille and was very excited to play this game. When I first played it I found it fun, but after about 3 times of playing this game I found it quite boring. When preparing meals its such a repetitive process and a bit long too. I find after preparing 1 meal I can't prepare a second as I've gotten handache. On the plus side, I find the animation cute, especially when blowing into the microphone."
3,good but more Basic than i thought,"First I was dissapointed that it didn't have Captions for the Hearing impaired , or subtitles in other languages.Also it was nice but too basic. I thought it would cover the recycling processes.Good for schools students, because it's short (~15 mins) and it covers how to of each class of materials and some extra good advice."
3,"Somewhat Dated, but Rather Comprehensive","This book remains perhaps the most comprehensive overview of the peoples of the Indonesian archipelago to this date. Also included are the peoples of Madagascar and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.The major ethnic groups of each region are described separately.Unfortunately it is now a bit dated, but until a more up to date work is written on the topic, this book remains a very valuable source of information."
4,Reminder,"Since I seem to have lost my memory, as well as my mind, I needed this so I wouldn't have to use a note pad that I always seem to lose! It work well but I wish it had volume so I could turn it up a bit. Seems I'm losing my hearing, too!!"
2,Not necessary,"Did you know that most cell phones now contain a ""recorder"" feature? You probably don't need this cheap little gadget - just learn to use all the features of your cell phone. We have so many electronic devices in our life now that we can't really use! :-) Check it out before you buy another one."
2,Not So Happy,"I mainly bought this for my husband who always forgets where he parked his car in the parking garage at work. I tried using mine and had it on my key chain in my pocket. The voice recorder is ""okay"" but crackly and weak. Also, the button was being pushed in my pocket and I could hear myself speaking in my pocket. Finally, the thing fell off my key chain and I gave up on it. It's in my drawer at home. Maybe it would be better to carry it inside a purse; but to me that would be a lot of trouble to retrieve each time."
4,good for short term memory loss!,"I bought these for my Dad who is 86 and sometimes can't remember what he went into a room for. Only tapes one message at a time, but can be understood easily."
3,Weak entry in the series,"The mysterious arsenic poisoning of detective Stan Shepard has his coworkers and friends worried--especially since most of them now know that his wife, Celia, had a first husband who died of the same thing.The book lacks a decent plot and characterization. Allie and Mark, central to the first book, are afterthoughts here. Aunt Aggie, while charming in the first book, now is a vengeful shrew. Guessing the killer isn't hard and it feels as though Blackstock phoned this one in. Here's hoping the next entry in the series is stronger."
4,A REALISTIC VIEW OF FOREIGN ADOPTION,"I had always wondered what it was really like to adopt a child from a foreign country, let alone have a child in my 40's after never doing so. This book tells so much more than a feature article in a newspaper or magazine -- it literally chronicles one couple's experience in a down-to-earth, realistic fashion -- from making the life-changing decision to welcome a child into their world, going all the way to China to adopt their new daughter sight-unseen, and then making a life and new routine when they return home. For most people, this is not second nature. The story is told in a funny, sometimes irreverent, but always heartwarming way -- the love like no other of having a child.The book is easy to read, and has great pictures to help tell the story. I recommend for anyone considering adoption and their families."
5,Can not get enough of this album - it blew me away!,"When I picked this album up, and put it in the CD player driving home, I listened to the first track ""Dust"" like 3 or 4 times before continuing on through the rest of the album, which is actually a full length album at over 44 minutes with only 5 tracks. I listen to both Fugazi and John Frusciante's works - I'm a huge fan of both - but this album is different then anything any of these collective artists have released. This project is deep, it rocks, all of the tracks are strong - If you're a fan of good rock music that inspires you to crank up your volume - buy this album. I hope to see these artists collaborate on future projects."
4,Not the typical Bob,"My 3 1/2 year old likes this show, however he's a little put off by the ""real life"" segments that are in each episode - they don't belong on a Bob the Builder show according to him! At first he didn't want to watch those parts (which is funny because he loves real life construction DVDs we have), but now he does ask for this show and watches it. I think we'll stick with the traditional ones though for his enjoyment."
5,"Best Zombie series around, period.","I have read more Zombie books than I should admit too, but I keep coming back to this one. I almost always prefer books to comics or graphic novels, but this series has me hooked. The characters are rich, the situations novel and the art work is superb. These are worth every penny, and I a person who watches every penny. These are much better than the TV show. I suggest you buy them all, because you won't want to stop once you start."
5,Its the Walking Dead!,"Great comic, great TV show, great video game, Great universe! Its the Walking Dead! You can't go wrong and won't be dissapointed. The softcover is alot more durable then most books, and it took alot of usage from me to damage it. The content you will have rate but I love it!"
2,Outdated book,"Well, it's a good book, sound advice, but it's gone. Here's why: the book has a model, it's based on the stock market performing well in the long term. Let me quote chapter 2: ""Start early and invest regularly."" Sure, all the Wall Street guys would love that. Give us all your money so we can play it all like blackjack. Look at Dow Jones, 10 years ago it was 10.6k, now it's up by 22%, worse than the inflation. So: ""Start early and invest regularly"" does not work anymore. All the calculations in the book are done assuming 8% average growth of your investment. Wrong! Does not happen anymore, forget investing in Wall Street. Get the money and spend them with care, that's it. New rule!"
5,Vanguard and John Bogle should be proud,"The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing is a straight forward, concise and no nonsense guide with a simple message...costs matter!It's a good read on everything from avoiding and managing debt, to how to manage an inheritance and all things in between. Great job and kudos to the three authors who come across loud and clear as a SINGLE VOICE..LynnC"
5,Well rounded and informative,"I considered myself somewhere between beginner and intermediate in terms of investing knowledge before reading this book. I feel it does a good job of highlighting most of the major investment principles and vehicles available and manages to get detailed without being too drawn out. It goes well beyond the typical cliches of 'max out your employer matched 401K' or 'fund a Roth IRA'. I found the areas of portfolio allocation and portfolio tax efficiency most beneficial to me. This book isn't going to help you get rich quick, but I feel it will help you increase your wealth and investing knowledge for the long haul."
2,There Goes Peter Rabbit!,"In this board book, Peter Rabbit scurries by his forest friends with nary a word or glance to deliver his valentine. The lesson here: it's OK to be rude to your friends.Keeneye has always believed there should be a law against imitating Beatrix Potter and (true to form) this effort is a D- with the illustration featuring starchy-looking Jemima Puddleduck the least awkward.The book is a tad too big for a wee hands but the tot will find a way to open and close the book a million times to hear Peter's brief recorded message on the last page.All in all, a well-intended endeavour but (parents and guardians) ... proceed with caution! Start the tot with the real thing!"
1,wrong dvd,"I ordered Walk Away Pounds Muscle Mile One and received The Walk Diet. The packaging is correct and shows that it is Muscle Mile One, but when I play it there is the Walk Diet and the reason I know this is because I have that VHS tape."
2,Facts About Luther,The content of this book is good. It is a subject that i have a lot of interest in. However it is almost impossible to read due to the method that it was scanned into the reader.
1,Not at all what I expected,"I returned this book.I was trying to find a peanut allergy book to give to the children in my daughter's class, to help them (and their parents) better understand why she needs to be so careful about peanut butter, etc. I didn't like this book for two reasons: 1. It has pictures of the elephant turning red and choking, and 2. It says things someting like the elephant's classmates felt sorry for Allie because she couldn't have peanuts. I think there are much better books out there for the purpose of educating others, one of which is out of print and I'm just heartbroken about that. It is the perfect book, ""The Peanut Pickle"". Unfortunately, the only ones I can find are online and whomever is selling them is asking upwards of $160.00. Shamefull."
4,"Complete Crap--but as such, as entertaining as a Mexican Wrestling Movie","I saw Cop Rock back in the day, and I can tell you it sucked. The only way to enjoy this cocaine-fueled idiocy is to recognize it's horribleness and revel in it (though I don't think it rises to the level of a Santo or Godzilla movie). The concept was bold, if very odd, and the creativity it took to come up with the idea of combining police drama and goofy pop-opera should be commended. Or, rather, being able to actually get a network to air it should be.But the songs! Oh god, the songs really, really, really sucked. Really. Sucked.To be honest, there were really only two songs in the entire series--the ""fast one"" and the ""slow one,"" with slightly different lyrics each time. Crappy, generic ""rock"" tunes with insipid lyrics. Fans of the Broadway musical ""Jekyl and Hyde"" would even cringe.All in all, the show was crap. But it was extremely weird, unique crap you never saw the likes of before, and will never see again."
4,Before it's time,"This was a great show, definitely before it's time. It featured gritty performances that were interlaced with fun. The show wanted the audience to not take it so seriously--it's TV, for gawd's sake!Trio showed this, but somehow managed to miss 3 episodes, which makes it difficult to tape. Hopefully, it will be released on DVD."
4,Ironically Kimbotean-- Boyd gets infatuated with his own ideas,"It seems when Boyd opens a new door he slams all other doors closed. Such a big deal is made of Boyd's conversion from ""Shadean"" to ""Kinbotean."" This means that Boyd doesn't acknowledge the obvious, i.e. the poem ""Pale Fire,"" by the fictional Shade, is ""bad."" Maybe he thinks it is too carefully composed to be called bad, but parts are undeniably(and purposefully) ugly. The fictional commentator Kinbote is equipped to recognize its ugliness, and that adds a comic element to the text, and entirely different interpretations that Boyd refuses to see. I was glad to read from Boyd all sorts of details that I could never figure out on my own. But its so frustrating that Boyd can't seem to see the ""big picture!"""
2,good but not for me,"This is a touching book, it gives a good picture about a young woman who was a great student and a wonderful person, who falls into a dark world of drug abuse and depression. She gets AIDS and soon dies. The mother, who wrote the book tells the story in a very moving way. There were a few parts that I couldn't beleve but overall I thought it was very realistic. I didn't love the book though, Its just not the kind of book I read, I was forced to read it for a class. At frist I thought it would be terrable but soon I started feeling sarrow for the people in the story. Its not a bad book its just not for me."
3,This book tells of the tragic death of a mentally ill child.,Does our society allow people with Alzheimer's disease to roam the streets working out their own problems? Do we finance constant visits to therapists so they can get to the root of their disorders? Why do we do that with younger people when they too are suffering from a brain based illness. I found this book so frustrating. Why wasn't this woman allowed to care for her sick daughter as she would have been allowed to care for an elderly parent? Because of our insane laws about the mentally ill this charming child became a drug addict and finally died of AIDS. The author is a wonderful mother. She did everthing our society would allow her to do. It wasn't enough.
1,Don't buy this iron,"I don't recommend this iron at all. I've had it for several months now and I just really hate it at this point. I'm heading out to replace it as soon as I am done writing this review.1. it has very awkward shape and is very heavy2. the steam buttom fell of about a week into me owning it3. it does leak a lot when you have it on the steam settingThe retractable cord is neat and it does heat up nicely and is able to do its job when its stops leaking and I can keep the steam button from falling off. But overall, I wouldn't suggest buying it AT ALL."
4,FUN LITTLE STICKER BOOK FOR KIDS,Remember Colorforms back in the 60's and 70's? If you're a parent now you probably played with them back then and now your kids can too. This sticker book isn't really a sticker book but rather vinyl clings just like those old Colorforms sets. The book features various scenes from the Madagascar film that your kids can use the various character clings to create their own scenes however they want. Since they are vinyl they are removeable for use over and over again. Perfect for pre-schoolers. We have not seen the movie as of yet but this book was given to my three year old recently and he really enjoys it. If your little ones love animals they are sure to love it too.
1,"""Without prejudice"" Very disappointing","""Without prejudice"" I bought this DVD hoping it would be of help to recommend to my reflexology students, alas, I found it to be no better than a foot massage, poor technique overall! It joins a growing list of similarly disappointing DVD's / videos on the subject (I have over 200 books alone on reflexology)Anthony Larkinhttp://homepage.eircom.net/~footman"
1,Do not buy,Falls over constantly. Fustrating for everyone. Only good thing is the sleeping bag that comes with it.
3,New Age Post-Punk,"Like Eve 6? Like Vertical Horizon? Like Third Eye Blind?I thought so, which is why you're at this page.If you heard NEW AGE GIRL from the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack and thought this would be a GREAT album with alot of similiar songs, you were wrong. There are no similar songs and that is the best Track on the CD. Regardless, this Album is good. Listenable few tracks like Perfect Family, Your Love is Killing me, and Marguerite, but after that the album goes flat untill Sentimental Crap which is a great song. But then flat again, boring and stale. About Five Songs out of 11 are good. Sure, 5 songs is alot, but that means there's 6 songs that arent. more bad then good.Which is why this gets a 3. Listen the Samples, if you like it, buy it. It's so ridiculously cheap."
5,i have the cassette,this is one of the best soundtracks ever but its missing one song dint know the title i am a serious music cillector music is me and i happen to coma across the cassette brand new my favorite song everybody get lose i would love to see vanilla ice in public cant believe its been fifteen years so if anyboby wants a copy ley me know
5,Highly Recommended,"Absolutely the best book I have read on this subject! Couldn't recommend it more! This is my favorite bridal shower gift, as it is a helpful tool for getting started learning about the sexual relationship and is a great resource for years into exploring the gift of sex in marriage. Doesn't hide anything, comes complete with illustrations and celebrates a proper respect for the body and sexual intimacy."
4,The best Christian sex book out there!,"The best Christian sex book out there written by a licensed psychologist/Christian sex therapist. This book is written for the mutual benefit of both wife and husband. It takes a very comprehensive and holistic approach, includes the spiritual elements as well as practical techniques and everything you can think of and some things you might not have even thought of. I highly recommend this to every married couple and to the engaged couple -- about one month before their wedding."
2,A relentless assault on the attention span,"Peter Pan is a timeless story for children of all ages, but this movie drags out each scene beyond the limits of our ability to sit quietly without fidgeting. The (actual) children that watched it with me were filled with a sense of wonder (as in ""I wonder when this scene is going to end""). The continued state of ""peril"" for the child actors in this story makes the whole scenario work better as a cartoon (cannonballs? sharp swords? drowning? arrows? plummeting from great heights?). It is surprising that some other reviewers think that the most dangerous thing this film will teach kids is how to ""mouth"" kiss. Also, the same actor plays both Capt. Hook and Wendy's father. Is there a single kids' film that doesn't feature this tired Oedipal angle?"
3,Hold onto your DVD copy!,"The picture and sound upgrade on this Blu Ray are noticable. But, there is not a single extra or special feature on this one. All the deleted scenes and ""Making of"" features on the SD DVD are gone. So, if you buy this PETER PAN, you'd better hang onto your SD DVD."
5,I do believe in fairies!,"I found this movie to be enchanting and dark all at the same time.There is much beauty in the scenery and the emotions in the characters.I find this movie to be extremely enchanting, however it does have it's tense moments, so I don't recommend it for children under 7 years of age; or any child that is prone to nightmares.Peter Pan has always been a wonderful story, and I love to see different interpretations, and this one stands right up there with Disney's cartoon version."
3,A Good Movie That Got Annoying.,"I love the story of Peter Pan and was excited to see this thing in theaters. I was disappointed, but not overly so. I loved the actor that played Peter Pan, but I found his yelling when he was flying or fighting a bit much and annoying. I loved the young beautiful girl who played Wendy, but her teeth were...interesting to say the least. It was so obvious they were fake. What was wrong with her natural ones?All in all, the movie *is* fun to watch. I'm sure the young kids may like it. :)"
5,Loved it!!!!!!,"Gee, I cried like a baby!At age 19, it was SO good to remember old Peter Pan. I just watched it, and I remember now that as a child I used to play with my mind, imagining that Peter didn't had to leave Wendy and that they lived ""hapilly ever after"" like in the stories that Wendy told Peter (""They end all in a kiss.."").Really, the BEST movie of Peter Pan EVER! Buy it! I'm doing it. The Fairy dance escene es absolutly marvelous!!"
5,One of the BEST family movies,"I took my girls to see this at the theatere, and I had no idea that I would enjoy it so much!! I've been counting down the days until the DVD was released. This movie was worth watching again and again!!"
5,The Feel Good Fantasy of the Millennium,"I can't stop watching this movie! Everything about it is visually stunning and entertaining. The story and acting warm the heart. There is a child in everyone one of us that does not grow up. This movie will bring it out in you. Fabulous! Fabulous! Fabulous! Fabulous! Fabulous! C'mon now mate, be a child again......"
4,"Time to treat yourself, and take a trip with Peter Pan","I saw Peter Pan when i was a little boy, and it stirred my imagination soomuch that i dreamed that i was actually flying with Peter.No movie could ever match what i saw and from that day i would not viewany new Peter Pan movie....till nowI have seen this Peter Pan movie, and it keeps up with the old and evenbetter cause its live action. Peter is great, the captain is still meanand dark as he should be. Can be viewed multiple time.."
5,Peter Pan,"I love this movie! It rocks! If you have not seen this movie you are so not cool. This movie is so cool, my friends were sitting there saying my name and I tuned them out because I was intreasted in this moive. With all the money I spent on going to the movies I could of bought the DVD. I saw it in theaters 3 times! And Jeremy Sumpter is so hot! Fhew. And Rachel-HurtWood is so pretty. I am so jelous. Well I'll shut up now so don't forget go buy that movie/dvd cause if you dont you will regreat it. Love ya Jeremy Sumpter!"
3,Results not delivered,"The test was easy enough to set up and use. But, after sending back the test and not hearing anything for a month I did a little searching and found [...]My results were never mailed or emailed back, but the above website allowed me to find me results. I had really high radon levels in my basement and it's just kind of annoying that the company never sent me the results as advertised."
1,only for short tests,"This product does not conduct long tests. If you expose the test for more than 96 hours it is ruined, the results invalid. For long tests Consumer Reports recommends Accustar Alpha Track Test Kit AT 100, also available from Amazon."
5,dejavu,Went online and entered my address. Got back results in 2 weeks. Looks like online entry really speeds up the results.
5,"Wow, really quick results","I mailed my radon test kit in on Tuesday, using priority mail. Today is Friday and I already got my results. Great service! Also, I found the radon levels in my family room were below normal, so I'm happy about that."
3,Works... but you have to call them for results,"While the product appears to have worked correctly and I got my results, I had to call them a few times to get someone who would give me the information for me to access them. They were supposed to email me this information, but after a month or so had passed I called them and finally got ahold of someone who gave me the information I needed to look it up online.Very unprofessional, but if you don't mind doing that everything else seems okay."
2,Never received results,"Like many others, I never received my results after months. Was able to log in on the website and see the results there. To my surprise the report claimed they received my test a whole month after it was mailed so it was invalid. I emailed the lab and they said this was emailed to me when it occurred and it probably went to my spam folder. They also said they can't be responsible for the USPS but they would send another kit free of charge.Assuming the test actually works as advertised and you still want to do it - I suggest the following... I would return the sample via Priority Mail and log in to check the results at the website (save the TEST # to refer to!). Do not wait for notification of results and do not mail it via USPS First Class. If you do these things you are probably ok. Others seem satisfied otherwise.There are likely better options though out there - just not at this price point."
3,Read if you are in NJ,"I guess it isn't First Alert's fault....BUT......The product description says ALL LAB FEES INCLUDED, however, once I ordered it and opened the box, there is a note inside that says NJ residence must submit a $10 state of NJ processing fee or no test results will be released. Now maybe that isn't First Alert's fault but it would be nice if that information were disclosed a) in the product description b) on the outside of the package.I returned it for a refund. I may still have to pay the NJ fee no matter which test I buy but I would like to know that up front."
2,Not as described,It was clearly stated in the description that the lab fee was included--NOT! There is an additional fee of $10 that I must send with the test. Not happy about that!
1,No report on test,Never recieved a report on the test. Called and did not get any help. Not sure if I have anything to worry about.
5,Great! Impressive Service!,"Can't compliment this company more. I ran the kit from from Friday afternoon - Sunday afternoon (48 hr). Sent to lab via USPS Next Day for $18 on Monday morning. Lab received the kit at noon Tuesday and I got an email with results by 5pm Tuesday (same day!). I did pay the $10 rush fee. For $42 all in this is really a great way to go, our inspector quoted $150 to run a test but since the house has a mitigation system we did this for peace of mind. Results were good."
3,amazon sent me the greatest hits,the picture is not what you will recive its the greatest hits i hate the greatest hits i wanted the one in the photo very misleading and disapointed
3,"Fun Game, but Full of Glitches","Smackdown VS Raw 2008 is a step down from 2007 even though it has the ECW brand in it. The problem with most wrestling games is that they are not challenging enough. A six-year-old can through it in an hour. There should be more storylines! Don't get me wrong, the game is fun to play, but it is very easy to play."
1,Lasted only 2 months...,"Bought this before xmas 2007 for my wife, worked fine for a while, then it died. When it comes to MP3 software, I have little faith, the iRiver H10 that I own occassionally freezes while the computer interface is problematic. This Sandisk product bypasses a computer interface, which is good, but the thing died with no response. The computer detects it via the UBS, but the thing itself can't be turn on.The only consolation is that tech support is friendly and helpful, and provided some instructions to bring it back online, now I'll try to resuscitated the little gadget."
2,"Fair product, but quite glitchy.","This MP3 player has fair sound, but the equalizier option is useless. The product is also glitchy. I had to use the ""reset"" button right away because it stopped working."
1,Horrible Product!,I've hated this thing since I first got it a month ago!First it was the horrible user interface - the controls are just retarded; there was no thought put into this design.It's also very glitchy - sometimes it just won't turn off and sometime one press on the volume sends it all the way to maximum and you have to try to turn it off to reset it.I have never dropped it or had it exposed to any moisture - it's just poorly designed. Sansa/Sandisk will never get a cent out of me ever again!
2,sandisk,The product is ok but it came with no directions which has made it difficult to use. I wanted to use the recorder but half the time I cannot figure it out and when I do it is by accident.
1,Doesn't charge,I have a macbook. I couldn't get it to charge on the macbook so I bought a usb charger. I have just had the thing charging all night and no power. I've had the sansa a few weeks.
1,Looks Nice - Doesn't Work,"I would advise caution when dealing with BEKIWO. They shipped my wife the 1GB SansaExpress that arrived just in time for Christmas. Exactly what I wanted, and I couldn't wait to enjoy some music. Unfortunately, I am still waiting for that experience. After charging the unit for 4 hours on my desktop I was amazed that it would play music for about 5-7 seconds before it shut down. I have reset the unit again and again and the result is always the same, an ""auto shutdown"". Unfortunately once BEKIWO has your money you will never hear from them again. My first clue was the e-mail address they used to respond to our inquiry: 49jq6qddzphfgc8@marketplace.amazon.com. I have notified SanDisk that the unitis defective and hopefully they will honor thier warranty."
4,Works great for the price!,I really like this...except that it doesn't stay paused where I stop. I really hated this as I'd have to find where I left off in my audio book each time. Finally I found that if I turn it off completely it will stay where I paused it.Very easy to use.
1,Cheaply made and fragile,"Very cheaply constructed and fragile. Will break with only minimum use and Sandisk will not honor their warranty. I had mine 4 days and it never played a note. Four days of arguing with tech support and RMA and the result was ""Too bad for you. Guess you own a broken MP3 player."" Same thing happened with an M240 I purchased a month previous. Save your dollars and purchase a different brand."
2,No power No music,My girlfriend purchased the Sandisk this for me for Christmas. I was excited and loaded the entire space used for about a month then couldn't get it to charge on anyone's computer try mine hers and others no go.I will spend a little more money and get something that won't break in a month. I had one that worked with Triple A batteries but only 128 MB buts its still ticking.Not a very good product very disappointed. Not sure I will purchase another of this brand.
2,Not worth the hassle,"This is my first mp3 player so wasn't sure what to expect. For the first day I was happy with how easy it was to use... then the problems began; radio presets don't work, battery doesn't stay charged very long,radio recpetion's not great, has mysteriously turned off by itself a couple of times. I'm taking it back to the store and will try to find something more reliable."
2,great at first,"I purchased the sansa less than a month ago and was really happy with the value. For its price, it really is a great player. But it only lasted a month. Then it just stopped turning on/charging. I should be able to exchange it, but still, this was very disappointing. When it did work, it worked relatively well, but there were some noticeable software errors, such as songs repeating despite being on shuffle and some songs simply not playing or showing up in the library."
1,NOT for audiobooks,"this may be great for music but if you listen to audiobooks, don't even think about it! doesn't reliably resume (return to previous point) and fast forward takes forever, especially if you're trying to get through hours of already heard ""pages"" to wherever you left off."
2,"god, this is STUPID!!!!!!!!!","i don't mean ALL THE STUPID THINGS I DO HAVE ABSOULETY NO REFLECTION ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU, JESSE'S LYRICS ARE KINDA CORNY! IS HE GAY? I WOULD MUCH RATER HEAR MY CRUSH GAGE SING! bY THE WAY TODAY(NOVEMBER 8,2005) GAGE SAT RIGHT BESIDE ME AT LUNCH. OH YEAH TO THE CD YALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD GET UR SHINE ON!!

I'M SICJ OF FUSSING WITH U BLONDE HEADED GIRLS WHO PRAISE AND BREATH AND LIVE AND WORSIP JESSE. THAT'S ALL I GOTTA SAY!!!!!!!!"
3,Okay the lyrics are very very good but...,"The Good Life's Tim Kasher has some very original, inventive lyrics in the sarcastically(I hope) titled ""Album Of The Year."" And the words are delivered with a pure sincerity and raw emotion that you just don't see much anymore.So it sounds like it should be a good album right.Not so fast. Even with all that on his side, he can't really seem to write a song with a decent melody. The replay value of this album is very low. The songs are mostly slow, stumbling, acoustic arrangements about what else, rellationships. Now don't get me wrong, I love acoustic music. I love it. But this. This just bored the pants off of me.On the bright side, the liner notes can be used as a neat little calendar.(I'm serious)Standout tracks are ""Notes In His Pockets"" and ""Album Of The year""Fans of Bright Eyes or maybe Paul Westerberg may enjoy this album."
4,Great Product,"I opened the package and completely expected what I ordered. For whatever reason some of the ink was coming out and got on my hand, but I wiped it off put in the machine and it has worked perfectly. No problems whatsoever since. Other than that the product was an incredible bargain and I could really care less about the ink on my hand. A little ink is better than paying [...] bucks more at a retail store."
1,Wrong Size suggested for Printer I purchased,"I bought the Brother MFC 490 printer in March 2009, that has been great wireless for our laptop as well, but when I purchased the Printer, this set of Ink Cartridges was suggested as an add on, the price was right, but I ASSUMED that the suggested cartridges would be capatible with the Printer I was currently buying, well 6 months later I finally need to use these add on cartridges only to find out that they dont fit!!! Lesson learned, never assume that the Amazon add ons are capatible to whatever you are buying, never will do another add on purchase again."
2,Problem second time around,"I thought this Ink Set was great with my first purchase. Everything worked well. It was sent and received promptly, and the cartriges worked well. On my second purchase however, I've had a problem with one of the cartriges and am waiting to see what happens with the complaint sent to Eforcity."
5,Great!,So far this is great... very good price... it arrived in good time and it prints well... at least on standard documents... I haven't printed on photo paper...
5,Works great with Brother MFC-440CN,The price is great and the cartridges work perfectly in my Brother MFC-440CN multi function printer. I don't know how long the cartridges will last but at this price I couldn't go wrong.
5,Save some money,These are so much cheaper than what I was paying before and I think they have actually lasted longer than the brother ones.
1,this product fried my ipaq,"I got the unit in a timely manner. However, when I put in four fresh AA batteries and plugged it into my ipaq h3850 and turned on the battery unit and the PDA, the PDA screen flickered briefly, then died. After that, the PDA would no longer turn on, even when plugged into the AC adapter. The ipaq h3850 requires 5 volts of power. The Gomadic unit supplies 6 volts (four AA batteries is 4 x 1.5 volts = 6 volts). Supposedly, the Gomadic unit regulates voltage, but if it doesn't, that would explain why my ipaq died. The construction of the battery pack is also somewhat flimsy -- cheap plastic. Overall, I am very disappointed in this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. I want my money back (and more than that, I want a working ipaq, but this is rather unlikely)."
3,Classic collaboration yields one memorable track,"The story of this ""Cult"" album is well-known. I'm glad to finally own it. I do have the orginal 45rpm of Sour Milk Sea.My review title says it all - about the song mentioned in paragraph one. A terrific George Harrison composition on its' own, given more cache as a vehicle for a roughcut bar rocker, Jackie Lomax. I assume prototypal equalizers were used to get him on key - can't do much with a limited range and flat dynamics.This album/CD would have possibly succeeded, originally, if Apple had simply put out a groovy E.P. on J.L. Four songs - Sour Milk Sea, The Eagle Laughs At You, How The Web Was Woven (a fine beat ballad also done by Elvis, as a 1970s B-side), and.....I guess...Thumbin' A Ride."
4,This was such a cute story!,"I was actually surprised at how much I like this book. The characters were not shallow, but were easy to like, even the secondary characters were enjoyable. It makes me want to check out the other books in the series."
5,Excellent for my intended purpose for small milling machine tray.,"S&K; #700 17-1/2"" Galvanized Drip PanI bought this to catch misting coolent from a small milling machine (HF47158) which it does fine. It's not going to catch flood cooling but does fine with the mist cooling. If you are going to use flood cooling, you are going to have to have an enclosure for the whole mill to keep it contained. The misting coolent dosen't drip that much off of the mill when running so this does a great job. Not the intended purpose but works fine for this application!"
3,I've seen better,"I read this book and it wasn't what I expected. It tells you all this crazy stuff you have to do before starting any magic and its just not true. I was also expecting more spells, but there were hardly any in this book. There are better books to read that would teach you more about magic than this book does. I gave ""good magic"" three stars, because I have to admit the sections on the definitions of each herb and crystals are accurate and gives plenty of expenation on each one. With these two sections alone would be two different books, so I like that this author has put them in and is so imformative. Over all its a good book to read, but I would not add it to your library, I've seen better."
5,The Best Book for Learning Beginning Magic - With Pictures !,The pictures are what sold me. These are not hand drawn pictures but photos showing you the meaning of magical practices. You see in photos examples of what is being taught. What a concept. Seeing what you are being taught. Buy this book.
4,A good beginner's guide to practical magic fundamentals,"This book introduced me to the world of Magic and witchcraft. It was a good overview of the various techniques and tools for witchcraft. The book is empowering for the beginning practicioner because it teaches that power emanates from within, and not simply through empty ritual practice. The rituals are treated more as focusing and meditation tools than simple ""spells."" I would have liked more discussion on theoretical existential matters (such as our place in the universe, how the universe actually works, etc.), but overall the book is comfortable and easy to follow."
1,don't waste your time or money,I received the train today for my 14 month old. I am returning it tomorrow. The tent is very flimsy and is not stable. It falls over easily whenever my son starts to crawl into it. Very disappointing. Not the quality that you would expect for a childs toy. I purchased it based on the reviews of others. It should have the rating of a 1 not a 4.
1,Disappointed,"My grandson loves Thomas the tank, so I thought this would be great for my house. He already has has a pop up teepee and a tent at his house. Because it has no floor in it, it flips over easily if he hits his head on the lower section. He is only 16 months old, so the lower section is pretty low. It is very difficult to take down and takes up a lot of space. I never did get it back in it's storage sack. Hopefully, we will have more success with it in the summer when it can be used outside."
4,Thomas the Train Tent - A-OK,"I ordered this - it shipped in proper time - my grandson loved it. If it lasts 2 weeks, 2 months or 2 years - it was worth it to hear his reaction to it coming out of the box. My daughter gave it a shake and it popped into place. I recommend this tent - the little ones enjoy it. I would purchase it again for others."
2,DID NOT HAS INDICATED!,"The equipment is a lot ruim fica always along Appearance as of massing , the handbook as of directives did not explains corretamente the way to bend for it to he may be afresh placed at the handbag , and also did not esplica how to use um conduit as of iron than it is to he came loose. DID NOT Has indicated! DID NOT Is fond of!"
5,Nice rainy day deversion...,"I bought this for my three year old nephew. It is very cute and easy to set-up. It makes a great ""fort"" anywhere. He really enjoys it and even shares it with his older brother. I would recommend this product. The only drawnback is you have to give the ""this can break so be careful speech"" before rough playing. : )"
3,Keeps them busy for a while,This product is just a tent that they can play in. My nephew really liked it and he is only 2. It fold into a little bag so it doesn't take too much space when it's not being used. I would advise to use it only on carpet floors.
4,Fun toy!,"This is a fun toy... My daughter is a Thomas fan & she loves this. She plays with it for hours at a time. It could be a little more stable, but these kind of toys never are!"
5,Clive's disturbed mind,"Here is the most hyped addition to the Tortured Souls 2 toy line from McFarlane Toys. Behold a jesus-like, crucified body with gas mask and altar of sacrifice. Sweet! Barker's mind is just twisted. I love this toy line. here's hoping for a TS3!!!!"
2,Does NOT keep coffee hot,"I am so disappointed with this purchase!! I have a number of co-workers who highly recommended the Contigo Autoseal mugs...claiming that they really were spill proof and kept coffee hot for a couple of hours (even in Minnesota...smile). I finally went for it and bought this set of two mugs. Even though the price was right, it was a waste of money. My husband and I both used the mugs for coffee and we both had the same experience...the coffee that was HOT when poured into the mug was lukewarm within 20 minutes. The box claims that the mug will keep beverages hot up to an hour and cold for four. That's so false!(I will say that I liked the size/feel of the mug, and it did seem to be spill proof.)"
2,Cold coffee,Seal works great no spillsBut drink your coffe fast it's cold after about 30 minutes and only holds 12 oz
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"This book is filled with short stories that are very attention grabbing and full of ""being a kid"" action. The stories teach important lessons incorporating some of the values students have lost. Brian's book is very easy to read and with its intended design, the stories are condensed so to keep the attention of the reader. I believe the reading level is approximately middle school level. It is a wonderful teaching tool and the kids just love it. This can be read orally or individually. Thank you Brian for giving us such a valuable teaching tool!"
2,Hard to put together,The mat itself is nice and strong. But to put the edges on is a night mare. The last one we owned was much better
3,Directions are not complete.,"The material of the plastic sheet is adequate, but I am dubious about how well it will stand up to winter use. The directions for assembly are not adequate, The ""how to assemble the edges are simply not detailed enough and it is very easy to not place the lock edges to close to the edge making it easy for them to slip off. The delivery time was several days slower than promised."
5,the beloved Drina series,"Drina returns from her glorious Italian vacation ready to work hard, and dance at the Dominick. Unfortunately, things don't turn out the way she wants them to, as she falls and hurts herself, meaning she has to stop dancing for a while. However, she gets offered a part in a play, and spends her time acting, which is something she enjoys. As soon as her injury heals, she's dancing again, and not only that, she gets a very special role dancing with the Dominick. I love this book, as I love all the 11 books in this series. Ms. Estoril writes wonderful stories, and makes Drina seem real. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves dance."
4,Good Product,Used 2 pair of these brkts to install a 60 inch glass shelf. Worked as advertized. Do be sure to order for appropriate thickness of shelving - especially if glass. Use glass at upper end of thickness specified for brkts or you may see some sagging.
2,weighing tickoo and toogood,"i have both beginner books tickoo's and toogood'ssure tickoo's book is more expensive than toogood's but it's worth every penny.Put it this way. toogood just brushes through every subject and tells you to ""experiment, play, etc"". sure i would experiment, but its' frustrating when you dont know your way around (beginner). i dont have time to spend hours ""exploring"" either.tickoo spoon-feeds you everything, and can be used easily as a reference guide in case you forget something. try doing that with toogood. you have to dig through his unnecesarily philosophical language. it gets even worse since the book is not arranged step-by-step like a self-teaching book should be.sure toogood might be a pro at using proe, but knowing is one thing and teaching is another. tickoo has 1/4 of a century teaching experience under his belt (or so i read)dont cheapen out on this one guys/gals."
2,Thoroughly Disappointing,As an atheist who studies the Bible I am disappointed in this book.The Bias McKinsey holds is palpable to anyone with any knowledge of the Bible at all.He stretches the truth of possibilties and takes far too much for granted as well as seeks to commit the cardinal sin of debating biblical errancy..he takes too much out of context in order to misrepresent the truth.The book holds alot of interesting points and details but each and every one should be thoroughly checked and re-checked before assuming any truth to them.Far to much money for such a biased point of view.
2,Depressing,"There's no laughter or smiles in this movie, just a snapshot at the saddest parts of the characters lives. It is interesting and has a good cast with good acting, but it's plain depressing and slow."
2,depressing,"I was excited when this movie first came out. I was very disappointed. There is no hope in this movie, no laughter, no joy. It was one of the most depressing I have ever seen."
2,Second half of book,This book was like coming into the middle of a movie. The first half of the book just left me with a lot of questions on who and what certain things were. I thought at first this must be the second half of a series. The author would make observations on something and not give any background information on them. I spent most of the book just totally lost on what and why they would do certain things.
3,"New poster, but the drawing is very old style.","New poster, but the drawing is very old style. Plus too busy. Not the best layout."
5,Kiss Creatures Set,"Wow... this set is the best yet. The costumes are from the Dynasty era and whats best is they finally have included Eric ""the Fox"". The authentic guitars have also been included the Iceman, Genes Axe and the Les Paul, each with actual strings. The packaging is slick and any fan would buy two sets ... one to play with and one to put away. You wanted the best ...You got the best... KISS!"
2,"OK, I guess","This product is OK. Was not shipped with all the parts needed, and Sportsmans Supply did not send what I needed, they just forgot about me. Lift works ok on old style Polaris, will not work on new style Arctic Cat. Lift is loose and won't hold its adjustment, but for one sled in one garage it's ok. Not great."
3,"Unfortunately, weaker than their first album.....","I really loved Dick Nity, and thought there was some really innovative stuff going on in that album. This one falls a bit flat though, I have to say. It's still a decent album, but most of the songs are fairly forgettable, especially towards the end.I was also disappointed to hear the same beat from KMFDM's ""Go To Hell"" as the background for ""NY Boogie"", especially since that beat was so memorable. It's so hard to find good industrial music anymore."
4,The Truth,"This was one of the best books I ever read ,even though I left me totally confused how you jumped from charecter to charecter.I rated the book a 4, because it was very graphic and left me amazed."
2,Piece of Junk,"The author just gives different combination of planets saying which are powerful and which are not, without explaining the reasoning behind the statements. Also the book is full of mistakes. I did not learn anything from reading the book."
3,Average at best,"I was hoping for better quality, better accuracy. You get what you pay for. Constantly needs calibrating."
2,"Works, but flawed design","This product seems to be mainly built from metal, which is good. But the plastic lens that covers the dial is too small to fit tightly in the metal ring, so it instantly falls off when the gauge is picked up. From the design, it looks like the lens is intended to be pressure/friction fit, as there is no groove in the knurled outer ring. This appears to me to be a design defect, not a problem unique to the one Amazon shipped me.Otherwise, this gauge works reasonably well for the price."
5,it's humanity in a comic,"I lived in New York between 1986 and 1989. Knipl's city is that city as much as it is the ""Depression Era"" city of a reader below's father. Katchor manages to draw timeless landscapes, give voice to people who are eternally present and asks us to dwell on topics that we would ordinarily focus on only in passing, if at all.Perhaps those who find his strip tiresome and/or irritating are those people who never think about what happens to calendar salesmen in February and simply don't care when given the opportunity. NPR was forced to stop broadcasting ""Julius Knipl"" because of an avalanche of complaints from the listening audience.If you have no use for or interest in the humanity that lives and works beyond the numbered avenues that are considered so important that they had to be given names too, then this book is not for you."
4,Well built and very strong!,"The Adjustable Doll Stands were well finished and very sturdy. They were delivered very quickly and packed nicely. National Artcraft gave more than value for the money.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the sizing. I wanted to use the stands for Madame Alexander dolls of several sizes. I measured the dolls and ordered the stands accordingly. It was not a good fit. I had to use the smaller stands on the larger dolls as the waist holder was just too big and the adjustable height sizer was not adjustable enough to come down to the size that I wanted.Perhaps if the company had a pack containing one of all sizes; that you could order and try our to find the right fit for your dolls? This would be helpful.Sheila H.Princeton, WV"
2,Not worth it..,"My son who's 6 just received this Playhut for his birthday and it looked like a really neat idea before I set it up. It's extremely flimsy, does not want to stay up, the tent space is TINY and the sleeping bag is extremely thin. All in all, it's a total waste of money, unfortunately I can't take it back because it's a gift."
4,adjustable clamp,Probably the best multi angle clamp I've used for liight jobs... especially at the price. Very light weight and sturdy great for small wood working and other craft projects.
5,"Although Not Groundbreaking, an Enjoyable Read","I began reading Drake's RCN series because of its strong similarities to the Aubrey/Maturin books. Although I recommend the RCN series for fans of O'Brian's historical fiction, after reading the first and second entry, I've also come to appreciate Drake's books for their own strengths. The characters, the action, the settings and Drake's sense of humor are all enjoyable and blend together to create something unique -- no matter how obvious the author's borrowing from O'Brian.While I found the pacing of this second entry to be somewhat slower than I'd prefer, it was still an excellent read. Although there's plenty of action, Drake wisely continues to focus on character development as well as on the interplay between his two protagonists. The RCN series may not be groundbreaking but it is enjoyable and this latter quality is far more important to me than the former."
5,"An Important book - essential, gripping reading","This is an outstanding collection of writing on a very timely topic. Most are first-person recollections of war, with a few short stories as well as poetry. This should be required reading for everyone connected to the military, from the President down. You will feel the truth of war, the horror of violence, and everpresent, the hope of redemption and renewal. This book is not to be forgotten."
3,Detailed but VERY flimsy!,"This ""deluxe box"" is not like the JAWS one previously released by McFarlane. The JAWS one was firm. This one has great detail, but the figures DO NOT stay on the pegs well at all. Once out of the box place it on a shelf and forget about it. If you sneeze hard next to it they will fall over. Could have and should have made the figures stick to the base."
5,Well-woven stories and a fresh concept.,"Finally, a book worthy of portraying Mr. Platt's genius in conceptual design. The races are well thought-out, the conflicts are real and deep, and the plots are mainstream enough to catch a variety of interests but original enough to be a refreshing change from many of the over-dominating sci-fi 'empires'. This massive book tells an entire epic within its pages, and still manages to leave the reader wanting for more. Brilliant stuff. I can't wait for the next one."
4,Inspector Morse music,Excellent CD - would highly recommend to any Morse fans and lovers of the French Horn. Beautiful music and it evokes such memories of the series.
3,Not the Orignal Broadway Cast buy nice,"This is not the Orignal Broadway cast of the musical. Traks n 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9 were recorded in 1938 by Audey Christie (she was part of the original brodway cast) and Wynn Murray (she was in the original cast of Babes in Arms). The rest of the traks are from a radio show with Gordon MacRea."
4,great book!,"I had the opportunity to hear the author read this story and immediately bought it for my son and kdg classroom! It is a great reminder, for in our demanding world, that always keeps us 'busy', we mustn't put off SOMEDAY what we can do today!I plan on reading it to the parents on the next parent teacher night!"
4,Good stuff...,I didn't hear much of these guys but i grabbed ahold of this CD a few days ago and i really like it. Its one of those CDs that when u listen to it after a bad day it makes you feel better. The songs are simple but they sound good. Favorite tracks have got to be 4 and 10.
5,NUMBER 1,Jimmy Eat World started becoming popular when their album Bleed american was being played on the radio.Thats how I first heard of this pop/rock upcoming sensation.I think Jimmy Eat World will go down ahead of Green Day and be recognized every where.Jimmy Eat World is a great band.If you want a cd you cant put down then by futures.You NEED TO BUY THIS ALBUM!
3,A band on the decline,"This is where the band starts to go down hill. This album is average at best. There are some good songs on here, but it pales in comparision to their last album. I'm starting to notice a pattern here. After a band becomes famous and wealthy they stop writing from the heart. It really is true. I mean this album is average. Their next album was terrible. I'm done with this band. D O N E (I'm editing this, their next album wasn't terrible. I just hadn't listened to it in a while. I actually like it a lot. But, I still think their best album is their 2001 album."
3,"Not great, but entertaining enough","The Ultimate Adventure is an old fashioned fantasy story. It mixes adventure and humor and does it pretty well. And it's a short book, in other words, a short read. The Ultimate Adventure is not a great book but it provides the reader with a great glimpse into the fantasy novels of its time, and it is entertaining while doing so.As it's a very short book, it should be available in a low priced edition."
5,definately a head-spinner..,"The book The Familiar, by K.A. Applegate was a book that turned my head, K.A.'s books just keep getting better adn better. It all started after a battle, Jake was tired of fighting, tired of making the calls. when he goes to bed, he wakes up the next mornig, only something's wrong... the Yeerks have taken over Earth! and he's 25! Somehow Jake has been pushed forward in time, into a world where he has few allys, and has no idea what's going on. Will Jake return to his rightful time? will he even survive this misfortune? The Familiar keeps you on the edge of your seat, and when it's over, the reader is forced to stop and think... These books (the Animorph series)are both fun to read and full of morals and press the idea that there is no good or evil, black and white, just shades of grey. I would definately recomend this book to anyone who has ever been touched by the struggles of right and wrong."
3,a good buy,"I bought this books in the hope of learning spanish - a language I am fascinated with. It is a good book as a guidance, to take you step by step through the language BUT it definitely needs extras. Don't rely just on this book, you will be lost. you need to buy a dictionary and a few other grammar and pronoun etch books to accompany it. Once you do, it is a very good guide and helpful enough."
2,Average econs book with some trendy examples.,"While not exactly on my ""must-buy"" list, it does have some interesting examples and topics such as game theory and first-mover advantage. Buy it if you study the subject not for disgressionary reading."
4,Great Book,It is a great book and is in very good conditions. I wanna thanks Amazon to allow students as me the opprotunity to get books easily.
2,Sony dooms a great country CD,"It's too bad that the ill-advised strategy by Sony/BMG will forever cast a bad note over some good music making artists.This album really has some good music from two long standing southern rockers turned country. Up-tempo songs like ""Takin' Up Space"", ""Plain Jane"" ""Help Somebody"" and the ballad ""Things I Miss The Most"" make this CD notable for the music, If you like country music like Montgomery Gentry's efforts, this is a great disc, but Sony screws it up for this artist and others by creating a CD that no one will ever want to buy, and for good reason. It took over three hours in research and application for me to get the rootkit off my computer.If you want to support this great band, buy the concert ticket and show them the fans like the music. Don't buy the CD that will just line Sony's pockets and destroy your PC."
5,Great cd,"I stumbled upon this cd (excellent condition), in a thrift shop and purchased it for 99 cents...a real steal for a collection of this caliber. I lived in New Orleans for a few years (where Irma Thomas is the queen of soul), so I am familiar with many of the tracks. The remixes are pristine and warm. One of the best of this series."
5,Perfect!,Worked awesome. Went on easy with the video from youtube. Took care of my problem asap andhaven't had an issue since!
1,"These kids have good initiative, but little experience","The book was written by high school seniors that wanted to focus on strange laws that are on the books. However, they fail to realize that some of the laws make perfect sense, because they don't posess the necessary experience to understand why the laws are necessary.Also, in a few cases, they completely misinterpret the laws to mean something that has little to nothing to do with the law at hand.For evidence, the title is incorrect. Not because the law doesn't name alligators (it doesn't), but rather because the way it is written, a person has the option of tying the alligator to the fire hydrant. They should have excluded the italics if they wanted to say that there is a lawa against tying the alligator up."
1,Another Toshiba Disappointment!,"Guess Toshiba TVs age in dog years, bought this unit four years ago and now it is completely dead. The tv started showing some diagonal green lines a few months back and then would shut itself off; the power indicator flashes continuously and you had to unplug the power before you can turn it back on again. Did a google search, seems many people are experiencing the same problem within the same time frame, three to four years after purchase. Toshiba has lost this consumer's confidence for good, I will definitely look another brand for electronics."
2,A little old but still good,"If you bought this soundtrack when the movie first came out you would have loved it, at this point some of the music is dated but it's still good.Aretha Franklin has a song ""I Guess I Get It Wrong""(from the scene where Billy Ho loses his girlfriend) that is simply classic R&B. The title track ""White Men Can't Jump"" is funny to listen to and the production reminds you of some of Teddy Riley's stuff with Guy. The best part of the soundtrack is the last track "" Just a Closer Walk With Thee"" a gospel song sung acapella. All and all worth a listen."
4,Just back from UK,"I just returned from the UK and this CD had just hit the stores. There were listening booths everywhere. I really liked it and should have bought it over there, but now thanks to the Internet I can buy it here and have it shipped! It is worth checking out!"
4,What can you really say about an acrylic box,This box is exactly as advertised. It is clear and made of acrylic. I bought it for a sous vide project and it worked well for that. I was able to cut it with a rotary tool fairly easily and it holds up to at least 150-200 degrees Fahrenheit of heat. This item is appropriately priced and I would recommend buying it if you have a purpose for something like this.
5,This is enduring art,"Its weird and perverse, and in David Byrne's odd Dada world he probably appreciates the irony. Having grown dramatically in aesthetic and musical stature since his youth. . .his crowds have dwindled to the faithful. ""Used to be part of the Talking Heads"" is a very sad diminuative for someone so talented, who's consistently exploring and refining.""Look into the Eyeball"" is alternately rocking and melancholy and beautiful and angular. . .just like the guy. Buy it if you want to hear musicianship, buy it if you want to hear passion, buy it if you want to dance.One reviewer noted that his ""live"" performance (on ""Conan"") was weak. . .it was, and DB both looked uncomfortable and sang badly. On the other hand, his live performance on this tour have been extraordinary (I saw him at the Apollo Theatre and Bowery Ballroom. . .phenomonal). So all I can say is that the guy can't sing for the cameras (which makes you wonder about ""Stop Making Sense, I know. . .)"
3,Designed to make you feel good,"I probably wouldn't have bought this album but I was actually lucky enough to see David Byrne's tour as it came through Providence. He played most of the album at the show, which was probably the biggest feel-good live music experience I've had this year. The songs on this album were great live! How often do you go to a show and get as excited about songs you don't know as you do about your favorites from older albums? The best surprise was that Look Into the Eyeball was as much fun on CD as it was live. If you like Talking Heads' songs like ""Nothing But Flowers,"" I don't see how you couldn't like this recording. Byrne is still writing beautiful songs with lyrics that are just a little different than you thought they'd be. If you're feeling eclectic... [Also includes a super-happy-fun-fun-semi-animated activity book.]"
4,Excellent Addition,"I think this would be an excellent tool for teachers wishing to supplement their mythology units. I think this is is also an exceptional retelling of the historical/mythological war which began with the abduction of Helen of Troy. This isn't as technically or visually amazing as the Troy starring Brad Pitt, but it is thorough and does a good job at explaining complicated familial relationships and mythology."
3,The Face That Launched A Thousand Ships?,"This version is fairly well-made; my only complaint was the casting of Helen. Obviously when casting such a role, one cannot please everyone. But I found it impossible to believe this woman was the most beautiful woman in the world, whose appearance so bewitched and fascinated men that they would kill and die for her. The actress cast as Helen is certainly pretty, but in a rather waif-like and generic ""Vogue"" way that is certainly not representative of classical ideals of beauty in any way. Helen should not be merely ""pretty"", like most modern magazine models are, but her beauty should be more unusual and striking. For a perfect example of this kind of beauty, I refer you to Leelee Sobieski as the nymph Deianeira in the 2005 TV version of ""Hercules"". Now that's a Helen."
1,Read the Iliad and forget this movie,"I had just finished reading The Iliad by Homer when I casually caught this movie on cable TV. After a while I just couldn't stand it and turned off the TV. Movies who don't do justice to the book on which they are inspired are legions, but this one reaches new heights in stupidity and bad taste.From the Vin Diesel-style, abrupt, one-sided, acting of Achilles to the meaningless and ridiculous twists to the original story, this movie manages the difficult task of turning the Greek masterpiece into a ridiculous piece of junk.None of the actors are credible, the influence of the Gods is reduced to a bare minimum, CGI's are awful, weapons and armours would not look out of place at a ""bal masque"" - overall, this movie is definitely worth avoiding!"
4,A relatively faithful adaptation of Greek mythology,"For those seeking to be entertained, this movie fits the bill, as does the movie ""Troy"". For classicists, I encourage you to remember that neither ""Helen of Troy"" nor ""Troy"" ever claimed to be an accurate representation of Greek mythology, so it would be foolish to judge the movies by that standard; after all, neither movie is entitled ""Homer's Iliad""."
1,What a croc of cra@P,This is one of the longest and worst movies I Hhave EVER seen! The writer should be shot!! The special effect people should be hanged!! BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY!!!
4,BORING! If you like fighting see TROY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie has some redeedming qualities, and i saw it when it was on TV, and i thought it was alright, but then i saw TROY and i said to myself who cares if it drifts from the stroy a little, it was awesome!!! Acting was better in Troy, but the girl in this one was prettier so i dont kow whice to root for..."
3,Helen of Troy was interesting but gruesome,"This movie started slow but picked up later on. Agammemnon was a huge jerk, and there was waaay too much stabbing and bloody gore. The charactor Cassandra was very well done she was sooo realistic and my favorite person. Paris was totally hot!!! However in the book Achilles is a hero but in this movie he is just barbaric! it WAS a really exciting though even though everyone got stabbed and they show Helen getting raped which was totally un-called for. we really didn't need to see that"
5,Helen of Troy is an awesome movie!!!!,"Helen of Troy is awesome movie! Granted there may be some differences in the story, I think they did a really good job telling such an old story in the first place. The sets of Sparta and Troy were beautiful and the costumes were awesome as well.I think that all of the actors did a wonderful job. I loved the romantic story between Helen and Paris. I could watch this movie over and over again. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen. All in all this movie was wonderful.I highly recommend it! I have always been fascinated with greek mythology and this movie just made me more interested to find out more about it! I can't wait till it comes out on DVD!"
2,Not happy,I purchased this dvd knowing that it was used. When the dvd arrived it was in a cracked ripped cheap black unmarked dvd case. There was a sticker on the case saying that it was a used dvd without the cover. I did not break the sticker to see the dvd quality because I was so unhappy with the outside appearance. I'm guessing the dv quality was probably the same as the dvd case...terrible. Will not buy from this seller again.
2,Not very good....,This book was a disappointment. It was difficult to flip through and find any really solid definitions. Most of the dreams I looked for were nowhere to be found. I don't recommend this book. It was a waste of money for me. I'll be selling it at my next garage sale for .50 cents. Hopefully someone takes it off my hands.
5,A great book,This book was amazingly great. It was like a much more complecated Harry Potter. You really feel the emotion of all the charecteds. The only thing I hate is waiting for Abhorson!
5,A Beautiful Book!!,This is the sort of book you can read over and over again. In my opinion it is the best in the series. Lirael is the best character I have come across.
5,LIRAEL-GARTH NIX,"This is the story of Lirael, a young woman whom is expected to become a seer. But when she finds she doesn't have the Sight, she goes to find what she really is. On the way she realizes that her destiny holds a lot of responsibilities, and that she must stop an evil necromancer from bringing a sort of rogue fifth element to earth...Wonderful! A delight to read! The prequel is ""Sabriel"", and the sequel is ""Abhorsen""."
2,Good,"Though I finished the book in 2 days, it wasn't great. For starters, it gets about halfway through the story and leaves you hanging. We have to wait for ""Abhorsen"" to read the ending. Mogget, though always dangerous, has changed a bit in personality, for the worst. I liked him better in Sabriel. Other parts were predictable, ESPECIALLY if you've read ""Sabriel"" (Lirael's other Blood-type, Sameth's destiny--the biggest clue to this comes through Touchstone's own blood...). So, the best thing to do would be waiting until ""Abhorsen"" is out, so that you can read them both, one right after the other. It is a good story, though, don't get me wrong (with very loveable characters, such as the Disreputable Dog). I'd just rather have been allowed to see the outcome, instead of being ""suspended"" in time."
4,Not bad for the money,"I purchased this a few days ago from Amazon for a great price with awesome delivery and so far it seems like a good buy. Like other reviews said, the quiver broke right away due to bad design. Thus the 4 stars. As I said it was a bad design right out of the box. As far as accuracy it seemed to dial right in and hold a tight patteren. Plenty of power and accuracy makes this a great bow for the money. We'll see how this plays out as I put more miles on it.*(Update)* After I called Horton, they sent me an updated quiver mount for free. The first one was part of a bad batch. Great customer sevice !"
4,Good price,I got this textbook for a good price so I am satisfied with my purchase! It wasn't in perfect condition but I needed it for grad school so I am okay for that price.
5,good water shoes,very durable and good water shoes. I used them in flippers while scuba diving and also while hiking in wet areas. The only thing I did not like is the water stayed in them after I got out of the ocean and I would have to take them off the empty them.
3,good water shoes - not good for my fins,"These are great water shoes, but the toe area is too thick to fit into my fins. I plan to use them for water shoes only. I wish that they would fit into my fins so that they could serve double duty. Oh well..."
5,Fits well!,I bought this for my husband and me for our upcoming open water certification lessons and vacation dive this summer. I am a 8.5-9ish woman's shoe (normally I'm an 8 but lately I've needed bigger shoes) so I was a little unsure on what male shoe to pick. I went with a 7 and I tried them on last night and they fit VERY nicely. I'm not sure about the pull tab and how that will work with my fins but it can easily be taken off and the shoes will still be easy to get on and off. I defintiely will be recommending them to my brother and sister in law who are also doing the class/vacation with us.
4,Casual Review.,"Troubled kid with special powers that keep getting him kicked out of school.He has one chance left, at Volcano High where everyone seems to want a piece of him.I saw both versions of this film, they are both awesome.This version puts a different twist on it and its shorter.The voice acting is funny and they did a pretty good job.If you dislike hip hop and rap artists as much as some of the other reviewers did, you may wanna steer clear of this version. If you don't mind it they voice acting is pretty funny at times."
1,about as bad a dub as you can get,"You only lower you IQ by paying for this version of the movie. Don't give your money up for inferior product.The film itself is really good like half ""Parker Lewis Can't Loose"" and ""Dragon Ball Z"" but this dub is terrible. The voice work is flat and you can tell they couldn't care less. Shameful, awful, phoned in work.I can't support MTV for this nonsense, even if it has the original on the other side. Import a copy from Korea or track down the old Tai Seng release."
4,WARNING: Buyer beware!,"I really gave this movie one star because it is the average of four stars that I would have awarded to the Korean version and negative two stars that I generously bestow upon the MTV version. Seriously. You can purchase this DVD, that's fine by me, but after opening the package for the first time please follow these instructions carefully:1) Locate side A of your DVD which contains the MTV version.2) Rub vigorously with 60-grit sandpaper until you can no longer see your reflection in that side of the disc.3) Insert side B of the disc, watch, and enjoy.Following these steps will prevent you from accidentally witnessing the perversion that MTV has committed in trying to ""gangsterize"" this film."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! THIS IS A FAKE!,"THIS DVD IS NOT THE ORIGINAL DVD. IT DOES NOT HAVE TWO VERSIONS AND IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL VERSION, WHICH CAN CURRENTLY ONLY BE BOUGHT THROUGH YESASIA.COM OR A RETAILER WHO CAN BE TRUSTED TO BRING IN LEGIT IMPORTS.THIS THING IS A COMPLETE BUSTED BOOTLEG SHOT THROUGH A BAD CAMERA THEN CHOPPED, THEN CRAMMED WITH BAD OUT TAKES FROM RAPPERS IN SOME BIZZARE BLOOPER REEL.THIS THING SUCKS IN EVERY WAY IMAGINEABLE.I WISH I COULD RETURN IT BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL BAD SELLING IT TO SOME OTHER POOR UNSUSPECTING SOUL ON EBAY.DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.ANYONE GIVING THIS THING A GOOD REVIEW IS IN ON THE SCAM.BOOTLEGGING AND (...)ARE A BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS. DON'T BE A VICTIM. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. NOW RUN FROM THIS LOSER.THIS IS A FLAT OUT FAKE THAT NEEDS TO GO AWAY NOW."
3,let me fan the fires!,"THIS COPY OF VOLCANO HIGH HAS TWO SIDES IN WHICH YOU CAN PLAY!ONE SIDE IS GANGSTER GAY CRAP AND THE OTHER IS THE ORIGINAL 122MINUTE VERSION KOREAN VERSION! BOTH SIDES OF THE DISC ISPLAYABLE! YOU STUPID MORONS! If you found this part of thereview unhelpful then you are an idiot! you deserved death! stophave opinions and stop having views cuz they are all worthless!The movie itself is a Korean movie that is heavily influenced byJapanese anime! Or probably based on an anime, who knows! All Iknow is that this movie does not have as much action as somepeople (RETARDS) would say! the first REAL action scene is anhour into the movie! Before that it was usually 3 moves thentalk for ever! But the movie wasn't bad at all! It just was bittoo slow moving and boring! This part of the review wasn'thelpful but then again only my opinions matter and yours dont'!"
4,Well written,I like the book because it keep me wondering. But I did not like the Dante Character. I felt that his character should have been on a more positive note about African American Athelets. I did't really care for the part of Gabrille getting pregnant over and over.The book was an easy read. I read in in 4 hours. I think J. Jermayne is a good writer and I am looking forward to reading her next book.
3,You'll Never Have to Guess the Answer,"Snapshot is a novel that concentrates deeply on the ups and downs of relationships. Deciding ""whether love is picture perfect"" or not is easily disclosed as the author unfurls several stories of love, hate, insecurity, jealousy and deception. Although the author highlights the title well into the story line, character development is quite perplexing. It is very difficult to grasp the true nature of each chararcter secondary to a host of conflicts and contradictions. J. Jermayne's uncomplicated writing style enervates the readers making the 246 page novel a slow read."
4,A bit extreme,"Eddie Murphey is funny, there is no doubt about that. Some of his comedy is a bit extreme, and it's especially surprising since it was the 80s (a lot less of this type of humor then). Still a great performance and it's entertaining."
5,Now that I think about it...,"People are probably ready to call me crazy for taking one star off my original rating for this movie. But I got to thinking, and although this special is hilarious, I could really do without the bit about his drunk father at the end. That is a continuation from a bit he did during 1983's Delirious, but this time it ran too long (as another reviewer said). Not only that, it wasn't even that funny this time around. I usually stop the tape when that part comes on. But Raw is still worth adding to your collection.Anthony RupertP.S. I understand this special is finally going to be released on DVD. Can we get Delirious on DVD, please? (I'd even settle for VHS; I can't even find it on import.)"
5,This is the greatest comedic standup performance,"This movie is simply a classic. What makes it great is how each bit connects throughout the performance. Most of all, everything Eddie says connects with every type of audience by making fun of real life situations. By the end, you will catch yourself wanting to watch it again in order to commit to memory some of the best comedy ever performed."
5,Best standup video ever made,"In highschool, I rented this movie so much, they gave it to me! THE most quotable standup act in hostory...and Delirious is a close number two. Eddie was one of the best. I just wish he was still as raw as he used to be."
2,RAW,Delirious is much much better routine than Raw. Raw garners the odd laugh here and there. Save your money and buy Delirious instead.
3,"Not Bad, But No ""Delirious""","""Raw"" came out on the heels of ""Delirious"", one of the funniest live performances ever capyured on film and Eddie Murphy's personal zenith. So popular was ""Delirious""(why isn't it available on DVD?) that, politically incorrect as it was, much of it entered the lexicon of popular culture. For ""Raw"", Eddie came out in angry mode, stung from his recent divorce and ready to rant. While effective in a forceful way, ""Raw"" struck many as a mean-spirited diatribe. ""Raw"" is ultimately far less satisfying than ""Delirious"", so why is it released instead of it's far-superior predecessor?"
1,Bad Experience,I had to send it back to the seller. It was in terrible condition and unplayable. I received a full refund.
4,A Plus for Tolkien Library,"I found this book very informative of Tolkien's world, from first to last, The First Age forward, I got this paperback and it is well made and the black and white drawings are descriptive. Like I said a plus for your Tolkien library."
5,Walking through the rooms in my head....,"Back in the early 90's I was walking through Circuit City when this beautiful singing voice caught my attention. I followed that sound over to the video department where I fell in love with Shakespear's Sister ""Stay"". It sounded amazing. I immediately sought out the cd. I've been a fan all these years. ""Stay"" is still a really cool song. The video is pretty cool too.~"
4,Used video,We have a baseball movie collection and wanted the HBO movie Long Gone. It was only available in VHS and not being independently wealthy I chose the used tape. The quality of the tape was fair to good and we were able to watch a movie that we had not seen in over 20 years. We received the tape faster than expected so I have no complaints for what was expected versus what we received.
2,bad swtich,"Like another reviewer on here says... flashlight switch on cap doesn't do anything but click. Have to unscrew ( break connection) for light to go off. Appears to be a good LED flashlight, but for the faulty switch, I'm having a hard time justifying $22 for it. Will most likely ask for refund. I'm going to think about it for a day."
5,SWAN LAKE,"There is not much I can add to what has already been said about Tchaikovsky's ultimate Swan Lake, so I will just say that, in my opinion, after viewing other Swan Lake videos, this is BY FAR THE VERY BEST performance I have seen and enjoyed. I hope you, too, will enjoy this superbly magnificant and entertaining performance as much as I have."
4,really good just really different,"i am what i would call a pretty big thrice fan. in the other aspects of music i sort of changed my veiws. i now more so listen to things like COLDPLAY and THE KILLERS. but thrice has always stuck with me. so i guess my opinion on the fact they have gone down the road of those bands is a little bias. but i think that the album is great. they have the great synth at times but then bring that good thrice riff. may be not as complex. but i think it is still just as affective. my favorite tracks so far after taking 1 full listen, Music Box, Red Sky, Between the Earth and WHere We Lie, and Hold Fast Hope. overall i think its a great album and ill enjoy listening to it for a long time. but i cant give it five stars just because i do miss the crazy good and inventive guitar riffs of Teppei."
1,This CD freakin SUCKS,"im disgusted with thrice after hearing this. its just a bunch of lame computer generated noise with some occasional guitar and vocals that dont have a clue what genre they want to be. what happened to the true thrice??? Deadbolt....now that was the good stuff. this is crap. Artist in the Ambulance, even though it wasnt really the same sound anymore, was still pretty good, but this is horrible. theyre just a bunch of sell-outs."
5,Did you LISTEN to the album?,"Did anyone who gave this album a bad review actually listen to it????? For starters, there is not a world of difference between Vheissu and Artist In The Ambulance. I cant believe anyone would think this album is too soft, unless you like a million key changes in one song and the singer to sound like he is throwing up on stage.Even if you think the music sucks, at least read the lyrics. Actually read them and try to understand what he is writing about. Best album this year behind The Great Depression."
3,"Good album, just not thrice-like","Thrice would probably have to be one of my favorite bands of all time.That being said, this is a very good and thoughtful album, however, it is missing something. Gone are the wicked guitars and high energy drums that drew me to them in the first place and in their place are new, more electronic sounds with guitars in the background to keep the rhythm. All this in the name of being original too. I personally thought that all their older stuff, especially Illusion of Safety and Identity Crisis, were plenty original because of the unusually great musical talent (somethign lacking from many bands these days), and heartfelt and meaningful lyrics.If this was some brand new band that had just come out and this was their first release, then yes, i would probably like them and give them more stars. This is, however, Thrice, a band that i have grown to love and now a band who has disappointed me with their newest album."
4,Another band to change the style up,"There have been a couple bands to change up their sounds, some for the good (The Bled), some for the worse (fata). Thrice is in the good category. The have really given their all to this album. It's not all out screaming and chaos. It's structured. They also employ some different techniques. The morse code to begin the album, slow building acoustic guitars, and a chaingang chant on The Earth Will Shake.It's just pure beauty! I DO wish that they would have stepped up a little on the hardcore side but I'm not going to complain too much. This album should be experienced all the way through. It makes it that much more enjoyable."
2,What the hell is this,This new album is horrible for a thrice album. I am a big fan of the older stuff and was looking forward to this album for awhile. I saw some good reviews so I decided to buy the cd and I regret it. If I wanted to listen to Radiohead then I would buy a Radiohead album this is not the Thrice any long time fan will like.
4,surprising...,"Positives:- unlike most bands these days, their lyrics are actually pretty good.- unlike most bands these days, their singer isn't a queer.- the drummer isn't all that bad. he throws in some pretty cool fills at times and keeps some good beats.- good balance of slow and heavier songs.- their best cd.Negatives:- it could do without the occasional screaming.- the guitarists and bassist are very mediocre.- the drumming isn't mixed well with the rest of the music.All in all, it's a good cd and it surprised me considering their first 2 cds were gay"
1,A Kung Fu film without any Kung Fu!,"Despite this DVD's title, cover picture, etc., it's not reallya Kung Fu film. In fact, only about 5 of it's 88 minutes has any fighting at all, and what little there is is sloppy and amateurish.So, what exactly is this film? It's a very low budget, silly fantasy film: boy meets snail, boy rescues snail, snail becomes human and marries boy ... Actually, it's even stupider than it sounds!The picture itself is full-screen and atrociously dubbed in English. The transfer is pretty good, considering it's age.Why, I wonder, with so many really cool unreleased old Kung Fu films out there, does Tai Seng have to release such monstrosities? END"
1,Didn't hold up!,Our feeder fell apart in less than a year--my husband glued it back together--but then the top hinge gave way and the top fell off.We had had a similar feeder before that lasted for years!
4,"Sweet, smooth and seductive soul balladry.","This 1992 release is most definitely a rare gem worth adding to your collection. Perhaps because of Hip-Hop and New Jack Swing's domination of the Urban R&B charts at the time this CD failed to get the airplay, exposure and recognition it deserved. By itself, David Black's superb medley cover version of the classic New Birth hits ""Wildflower"" and ""It's Been a Long Time"" should have gotten this CD airplay on late-night Quiet Storm radio shows but apparently it just failed to happen. If you like the music of Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson, Will Downing, Keith Washington and others of their ilk you will probabably like this CD a lot. Enjoy!"
1,Why? How? WHAT?!!,"I cannot believe this movie made more money than the original which was far far far far better. This isn't mission impossible style, it's action crap that doesn't make much sense and was a waste of people's money. How in God's name did this movie do so well, better than the Perfect Storm and that was a wet piece of garbage too. It did twice as good as X-Men and that movie was amazing...action combined with good story-telling. I want to let everyone know that if you're planning on buying this, I feel sorry for you and your hard earned money. Good luck."
2,Major disappointment,"I am so disappointed at this movie. The reason I give it 2 stars is that it is a John Woo movie with our ""pretty"" boy Tom in it. The plot is straight and simple, and the fight scenes are not up to the standard of John Woo's previous movies. One note is that John Woo is not good at directing hand-to-hand combat scenes. And the gun battle in this movie really sucks. If you are a Woo's fan, then go see other movies like A Better Tomorrow 1&2, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Hard Target, and Face Off. If these are unavailable, then go watch The Replacement Killer and Broken Arrow. For those of you whimps used to watching sissy movies like The Titanic and The Wedding Planner, you might find it ""action-thrilled."" If you aren't that type, there are certainly better John Woo movies out there."
