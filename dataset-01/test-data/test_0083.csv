3,Did I get the wrong CD?,"So I recently bought this CD from foggypaws, and It is a decent CD, but it only had 4 tracks on it. It is the Prodigy Out of Space CD shown, but it only has 2 edits of out of space, and then the Ruff in the Jungle Bizness, and Music Reach 1,2,3,4. I am disappointed that I paid $10 for the CD, and only got 4 of the 6 songs it advertised, and not one of the cuts was the version I was looking for. Out of Space is a great song, but beware, something isnt right here."
2,Coleman Jumpstart system,Unfortunately the product was defective. The company was very customer friendly.I did not have any problem returning it for credit.
3,Watch Out,"I bought this not realizing it was an 'EZ Play,' five-finger piano edition. Hence no bass clefs, and the treble staffs are in enormous print.If you want the actual sheet music for Willie Nelson, keep looking."
5,Poison? Or musical cure?,"Belladonna, remember the name, in a short time they will be huge. The debut album is nothing short of brilliant. Haunting, melodic, full of dark undertones, the music complements the lyrics perfectly. Already stars on mySpace, it is only a matter of time before they hit the big time. Get in first, buy the album, you won't be disapointed"
5,"""How I Survived Being A Girl""","This book is about a girl who wants to be able to fit in with her brothers and the guys. When her baby sister was born she became more like a woman. She now no longer can be a girl that hanges out with the guys due to her new babu sister. This book struck me because I used to be a tom boy and I am no longer a tom boy.The character who touched me the most was the mother. I would like to be the type of mother she is nice,but firm. This book is a good book for younge girls, becuse it is a good book that tells the truth about life."
3,"Refreshing, Lengthy, and Fun","The Trojan Horse is perhaps a bit longer than many audiences would prefer and has a style of cinematography that is distinctly Canadian. For me - surrounded in Blockbuster by Hollywood films with different names but the same recipe - this story was refreshingly different.The story centers around the absorption of the Canadian provinces into the U.S. and the resulting political intrigue surrounding one Canadian man's bid to insert himself as the next U.S. president.While fictitious (and at times perhaps even ridiculous), the story contains certain elements of truth about U.S. politics, the rigors of the presidency, our current U.S. foreign affairs, and the strangely ambivalent relationship between the U.S. and Canada.Good cast. Good intrigue. Worth watching."
3,Written during a time of innocence,"Written during a different time frame. Sweet story, but not very relevant to today's world. Not historical, just old fashioned."
4,"a quick, easy read for GLH fans","This book was much shorter than most Grace Livingston Hill (GLH) books. I read it in one sitting. I am a big GLH fan, and enjoyed it. I was pulled right in by the story line, and I loved the romantic hero who saved Mary from her plight. There is mystery, adventure and romance... Although I can't say this is one of my favorite GLH books - I still give it 4 stars."
5,Best historical romance,I so enjoyed reading this book and renewing my experience with the Hazards and the Mains. I have seen the Mini series a couple of times. GREAT READING.
3,"Historically correct, but that's about it","North and South is is the typical Civil War historical novel filled with battle scenes, unrequited love and truly unbelievable characters.The scope of the story stretches from the 1840s until the eve of the Civil War as Jakes chronicles the lives of the Hazards and the Mains. The two main characters George and Orry are the only two real likable characters, although towards the middle of the novel I found myself sick of Orry's self-pity and tired of the boredom of George. The extremeness of the other characters, the crazed abolitionist Virgilia, the self-serving and proud Ashton, and the brutal officer Bent, makes them so unbelievable that it is impossible to think of them as real. The only plus to this novel is the historical accuracy that Jakes has employed.At the end of this novel, I knew I wouldn't be reading the rest of the North and South trilogy. If you are looking for a good Civil War novel, this isn't it."
5,ASTOUNDING!!!,"Without a doubt, the best Civil War trilogy I have ever read. Jakes is fascinating! You will forever keep these characters in your heart. Jakes takes you on a journey like no other. A definite page turner...you will never want this story to end. A MASTERPIECE!!!"
2,Go buy madden,"Not even online game play makes this game worth it, madden is far better, plus the BUTTONS MAKE SENSE, well on the GCN at least.And I am sick of kevin collabro (i listen to the sonics, he is their announcer) and he's is DEFINITELY not a football announcer!"
4,Better than Madden 2003 on Xbox!!!,"Why are most people,..., overlooking this game? ...I had read so many reviews of Madden 2002, that after buying my Xbox a few months ago, I simply ran out and got Madden 2003 when it became available. I was disappointed from the start! The Madden game looked as bad as my friends PS2's game and not anywhere near the highest quality games for Xbox like Halo and Project Gotham. Then I heard about NFL Fever 2003, I purchased it and played both side by side for almost two weeks. After many hours, and after showing off both games to several friends side by side, there were NONE of use who felt Madden had better graphics OR better gameplay! NFL Fever 2003 has stunning graphics and a more realistic feel. I have not owned a video game system in quite a while, and I am not ""loyal"" to either of these game titles, I am simply an avid football fan who wanted the best possible game for the Xbox, and NFL Fever 2003 is it by a landslide!!"
3,Its pretty good... not!,I bought this game. i already had nfl fever 2002 and that was pretty good so i decided to get 2003. well big mistake. the game is fun and all but now that ive played it if i play on rookie i win by like 20- 50 points boaring. now playin on veteran if i don't score on one drive i just lost myself the game. Its too hard to stop the other team on offensive when playing veteran. they throw long when i have a guy on him and he ctaches it i miss a takle and they score. its really low quality and frustrainting. this game is pretty fun. i need something thats in between rookie and veteran.
4,Rack Review,This rack helped immensely in my small kitchen for baking many Christmas cookies. Only thing that could be more of a help if it was a bit more sturdy.
4,Linden Sweden Baker's 4-Tier Metal Cooling Rack,"I bought this product about 2-3 yrs ago and just used it again this evening since I was baking a lot of cookies. If you at least receive one that's not broken or uneven, then it acts as a really great cooling rack or just setting on it trays of cookies (or whatever dessert you're making) that are ready to go into the oven. It folds up nicely so it doesn't take up too much space. Like others, I do have a difficult time getting the bottom rack to fold in easily b/c part of the metal gets caught on another metal piece. Other than that, I do think it's a great product."
3,"Great concept, but poor workmanship?","Since I live in a small apartment, I was really excited to discover the 4 tier adjustable metal cooling rack. I thought this would be great when I am on my cookie baking marathon. No more having to cool my cookie trays on stacked boxes in the living room. After my second use one of the lower bar broke. It seems the joint between the round and vertical bar just came apart, probably because it was not soldered properly. It was only $19.95 but I hate having to buy a product and see it not last for more than several months."
4,Great Space Saver,"I bought this for my upcoming annual holiday cookie making marathon and am so glad I did it. I gave it an early test run to make sure there where no unexpected unpleasant surprises when I needed it. It performed wonderfully. I had no problem with unbalancing. The rack is sturdily built. I was able to make dozens of cookies without the usual overcrowding and overflow of pans and cooling racks on my table and limited counter top space. Storage is a non-issue. I keep it folded in it's narrow product box and it's stored on it's side with my serving trays.The only design flaw was the rough edge on the bottom of the metal perpendicular legs. They will scratch any surface it sits on, though sitting it on a folded dish towel is an easy quick diy way to resolve the problem. This is why I gave it 4 out 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5. A great product overall and I plan to buy 2 more. Another for me and one as a gift for a family member."
4,Works Great,"The drive works as described. No issues with connectivity or loss of data. It is slightly bigger than some of the mini's but makes up for it with no hassle with extra ""programs"" on it. It is just plug and play and works great. I keep it on my keychain so it gets banged around a lot, and I've had zero problems."
3,"It works as 1G but when compare with others, I just return it.","I just bought it yesterday and returned it today. I have 2 USB drives before I got this one, so I did some testing by write (copy from laptop/IBM T42 to USB) read (copy form USB drive to laptop) and delete file in USB drive. File size is 189M with many folders in it.-Lexar 1G Red cases(989M) : write 83 sec, read 45 sec and delete 15 sec.-Lexar 256M Red cases(247M): write 107 sec, read 44 sec and delete 15 sec.-Memorex 1G (983M) : write 123 sec, read 43 and delete 7 sec.It's great on read and del but too slow for write (for me). Anyway, it comes with low price also. If you don't serious for write time, it will be good one."
1,"requires too much power, won't work on all USB ports","My old 256 meg thumb drive works in the USB port on my keyboard, but this Memorex TravelDrive has too high a power requirement and won't work on my iMac keyboard USB port. So the only way I can use it is to unplug stuff from the back of the computer or a powered USB port. There is no excuse for making a thumb drive that sucks that much power. I don't know if it is the fault of the LED light, but whatever the cause for it being a power hog, it severely limits the usefulness of this product. I recommend you pass on this one and shop for a thumb drive that will let you connect it to any USB connector. I'm back to using my old one. Really poor engineering decisions on this one."
5,Don't leave home without it :),My boyfriend already had one of these and I borrowed it from him for a presentation. When I saw what a great price Amazon was offering I just had to get one. I carry it in my work bag all the time and it has come in handy in several cases to transfer files.
4,Be careful.,"Very realistic toy, but watch out for the mine roller. It is easy to break off from the front wheels."
5,Must have!,This is really one of the best CD's I have ever listened to! I advise everybody to buy it; songs like EverybodyNeedsSomebodyToLove and Think are (for me) songs that remind me of one of the best movies ever made.
3,False Advertising,"The title given says ""The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording."" Although, on the cover of the hard copy I received it is titled ""Music FROM the Original Soundtrack""Now, I don't complain too much because The Blues Brothers are boss and it's good enough for what I need. Title your things more accurately."
1,This isnt',"really the blues, PEOPLE. This isa COM-E-DY cd from two guys who used to be on the OLD saturday night live. It has jokes on it like ""I have two pieces of bread, don't YOU wish you had a sandwich?"" that I don't get. But if you like old style comedy get this. If not get Bodge's unplugged for its great version of Layla acoustically performed."
5,Travelling with your camera,"As grandparents we went to Disney for a 5 night stay. One of our objectives was to take as many photos as we could for the up-north grandkids. Rather than use a 2 GB card or a 4 GB card we elected to go the 1 GB route. We purchased 2 SanDiak 1 GB Utra cards and are pleased with the results. Photos were recorded quickly and the results were stunning making for a number of 20""x30"" prints."
5,Excellent performance,"Have used this card exclusively for about a year and have not had one problem. Has handled maybe 1,500 images and many videos from our Canon S3 IS with ease. Video stored to the card is excellent due to the write speed. Would recommend without hesitation."
5,Works as advertised,Works great on my Canon S3 Is. Used it a lot and never had a problem with it. I purchased it on february of 2007.
4,"So Far, So Good","We got the cheapest possible memory for our digital camera, but noticed significant shutter lag.Ordered this chip with faster memory, for a few more bucks, and there does seem to be less lag. Would love to find something even faster, but would probably cost that much more."
4,"Ultra II is 60X write speed, 66X read speed","Not sure why SanDisk hides the speed rating of this card on the back of the package in small print, but this card has a 60X write speed (9MB/second), and 66X read speed (10MB/second).The increase in write speed while taking pictures was noticeable with a Canon PowerShot SD400 (a 5 megapixel camera with image sizes of about 3MB set at highest quality).This large card can hold over 300 pictures for my PowerShot.So no problems with the card, but it's only a few days old."
5,great stuff,It's been a month since i had this SD memory card. Great stuff. Fast and easy to use. Does what it says it does.I recommend it.
4,Ultra Special,I like this SanDisk Ultra 2 Secure Digital Card. The videos come out clearer and sharper.
3,Good but you can go with 2 GB,"Good but you can go with 2 GB. Can save as many pictures as you want, when it comes to saving little videos.. soon goes into memory full mode, I would have been better off with 2 GB."
1,Slow for copying a large number of small files.,"This card seems to have a good transfer rate when copying a small number of large files. However, it still crawls when compared to my panasonic 256MB SD card that is much older when copying a large number of small files."
5,Great Fun to play on the computer,The games were fun to play on the computer. If you like SpongeBob you will enjoy playing the pc games.
3,"Erase: Truly Gorefest, Except the Production","Erase was Gorefest's third studio album (not counting the live album ""Eindhoven Insanity"") and can respectfully called experimental. The sound on this album is again highly powerful, but does give a funny aftertaste when you compare it to the first two albums (Mindloss and False). Afterall; the first two are classic metal albums with recognisable sound, but this album has a rather unique metal-sound. So if you DON'T compare this album to their previous ones, this is a great album. But the reason for the average rate for this album is simply because they screwed with the sound producing. The sound is pure, but is far too clean! A terrible result for a metal band. Besides that the songs are, in contradiction to the previous and slower album ""False"", much faster and the return of unique guitarriffs make this album a perfect addittion to Gorefest fans."
3,Beware your shelf inset,"If your shelves come out all the way to where the cabinet door rests, these won't let your doors shut all the way. To test, take a chopstick or a pencil and tape to the leading edge of the shelf you're thinking of using these on. Shut the door - if it sticks out - these won't work. Same goes for the cup hooks and cookie sheet seperater (sp?), the sweater organizer, etc."
2,Waste of Time,"I love fiction, and science fiction. If you're absolutely desperate to kill some time, take a nap instead.Denning has some good books to his name. This book, and this series don't qualify."
3,They're on track,"This should be considered Sepultura's first album (and you'd agree after listening to their actual first album) because it is here where the band begins to develop their own identity. You can still hear the Slayer-isms (Hell Awaits era), and Metallica-ness (Ride the Lightning) of their music; but has enough agression to be considered 'special'. They refined their approach with the 'Beneath The Remains' album but this is where they started to have their own sound. Andreas Kisser's first album with the band, replacing 'noiseidiot' JAIRO. Recommeded songs: *Troops of Doom *Escape to the Void *From The Past Comes The Storms"
3,not what i thought it would be,i gotta say i love the guitar work but other than that i was disappointedsorry but i can't lie i thought it was ok
4,Real Good Book---Very Angsty and Romantic!,"I liked this book alot! The characters of Reed and Jaye seemed very real to me, and the plot was nicely rendered. Also loved the fact that Missy Good's book was the one they were filming! Excellent job."
3,"certainly strange yet readable, but Thompson's done better..","Even after the opening few lines one senses 'The Nothing Man' is very much all-Thompson: desperate characters, lots of boozing, crackling dialogue, and a wee bit of murder. The chemistry is all there yet, for this reader, the story just didn't ignite ... despite the anticipation that any moment it would.In our story we have junior hack working at a local newspaper who is really in bad shape. He's a boozer. His estranged wife is a tramp. And his mind is really twisted evidently because his, ahem, 'male member' got blown off by a landmine during the war. Very quickly he loses what little sanity he has and, in a ""I can get away with anything"" fashion, goes on a rampage. Enough said, but I will add that Jim Thompson has also thrown in a curious surprise in the final pages.Bottom line: vintage Jim Thompson without the extra bite and cleverness of his better works."
2,Stop messing with us!,"It's flash memory! Of course it works just fine. Why do we have to spend this kind of money for two 8mb memory cards?? In the world of computers, you can get 512mb for the same cash. It's just SO MUCH GREED it's sickening. Hey Sony, spend the twenty cents per console and give us 128mb of built in memory in the first place!! It's all we'll ever need at home. If we need to bring our saves to a buddy's house, we'll get removable media. (How about a USB port for thumb drives or an SD slot?!?) We understand how you're screwing us and we're angry."
5,So Much Space!,These are well worth the cost. There's enough room on these memory cards to last even the heaviest of gamers a while...
5,flawless,"I have a super slim playstation 2, got it this 2006 for christmas, I use both memories and is perfect, no complaints here. *****"
1,Not Impressed!,"Put batteries in (the right way), plugged into TV - didn't work. Tried going thru VCR - didn't work. Tried three different TV's and it still did not work. What a waste! Returned to WalMart and got a larger credit than what I paid for it online! Will never buy a plug-and-play again. What does everyone think of Gamecube???"
3,"Interesting in spots, yet tedious...","The bond between dog and owner is examined in a very touching way in ""Pack of Two"". Yet, I found that it started to become very tedious. As a fellow dog lover, I understand that a relationship with a dog can be fulfilling and intimate. I just think that Ms. Knapp over analyzed the relationship, over and over again. That is not to say, that I did not enjoy many of her insights."
2,A little too neurotic for my tastes.,"I am a dog lover and appreciated Caroline's love for her dog. But I found her analysis that relationships with dogs are all tied to other messed parts of our lives a little much. She loves her dog to make up for the love she never felt from her parents, etc."
3,Affirming but agenda-ridden!,"I enjoyed this book a good deal, but I thought Caroline's anecdotal examples were a little more compelling than her own self-analysis. The best parts of the book focused on Lucille, not Caroline. That said, it was nice to have the validation that there are plenty of us out there who consider the dog more than a pet."
1,Don't Bother,"Really, Don't bother with this one. I'm from England and the've discontinued it here. I've had it just over a year.The printing started fading on the right of the page so I bought a new toner. This didn't solve the problem. So I followed the troubleshooting advice and bought a new drum. This didn't solve the problem. I emailed Brother. They rang back (quite promptly) and after cleaning a piece of glass inside, it still didn't work.Finally they suggested I take it to be overhauled. The people I contacted at last gave me some sound advice. ""Bin it""Probably the last time I use Brother!"
1,A Disappointment,"""Offspring of a Deathless Soul"" tells the compelling story of the author as she unexpectedly adopts a Chinese girl. While the story is certainly an interesting one, it is told in such a fatastical voice with all manner of flowery language, hyperbole and mixed metaphors, that this reader is hard pressed to know whether the author has ever encountered a good editor. Neither a novel nor a memoir, the book reads like a cross between an article for a women's magazine and a standard issue pot-boiler historical romance.Strong editing and better self-control over her writing would surely have made this a far better book."
1,I got the wrong book,My son is in jail and cannot return the book which was sent by Jackster. He is only allowed 3 books a month so this really was upsetting for him and I also. The book that was sent was a book he has already read. So much for waiting and then getting something you have no use for plus the cost that I am completely out of since the jail writes his name on the book when it is received. I will never use Jackster again. I now know why they are the cheapest. They are worthless.
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"Contrary to popular opinion, I really did not enjoy this book as much as the previous two (Interview and Lestat). The book contains many characters which I didn't connect with or cared about. The reason being that the story jumps from one character to another without any real character development. By the time the story ended, I didn't care about Akasha or what happened to her. Only that it would end."
4,Second best book in the VC,"IWTV being the first of course. The parts I loved were Armand and Daniel, Khayman and Jesse's stories, Baby Jenks was ok. The parts that were boring and I skipped through were the Twins, Pandora, and Lestat with Akasha. Those parts just were not interesting at all.Anne's explaining of the origins of the Vampires is just plan stupid. Sorry but it is. It makes no sense at all. But even then the stories are great to read and the new characters are really interesting.Armand and Daniel should have had a book on there own! It's the most interesting story in the book!"
4,...Another Happy Ending,"...Just an old-fashioned love story between two boys, ""All-American Boys"" should be only another teenage romance. What sets it apart is the fact that it should have been written a long time ago. None of the characters are completely developed and the description of fighting techniques could have been more realistic. In fact, the last fight scene was more wish fulfillment than anything else. But, it was nice to read about a gay karate kid."
4,A fantastic CD,Of all of Kraftwerk's releases Trans Europe Express is their most accessable album. It is basically two concept albums in one! My favorite song is called the hall of mirrors. The song is about someone who looks in the mirror and doesn't like what they see. There is a lot of great tracks on this one. Go check it out if you like Kraftwerk or this kind of music. You can't go wrong.
3,"Man, Nature, Technology","It's a one of the best kraftwerk albums, I like it a lot. I would like it got the lyrics."
5,Perfection,"This is one of those very rare metal albums that I can without hesitation say is essentially perfect - it stands side-by-side with ""Reign in Blood,"" ""Persecution Mania,"" and ""Ride the Lightning"" as one of the greatest thrash records ever made; each and every track is incredible. The riffs are very catchy and powerful, and Igor's drumming has only grown more proficient since ""Beneath"" (which is saying a lot). Max's vocals are deeper and more commanding than before, as is the production; there's even a great cover of Orgasmatron. Buy this album - you won't regret it."
5,On of the best of its genre,Alongside Metallica's Master of Puppets this one is one of the best thrash metal albums. If you like this type of music buy it.
2,"Hard to read, not for beginners","The book is difficult to read and is definitely not aimed at beginners. Complex concepts are addressed without solid support for the lower-level concepts of which they are comprised. In effect, the book takes a complex subject, throws acronyms and abbreviated concepts at it, then moves on. Additionally, the glossary is not well-organized and the book has quite a few typographical errors."
2,Not that user friendly,"I`m a 2nd year computing student at university, and this is the prescribed text on the subject of Computer Organisations.On my account there has been several disadvantages upon normal standards, Firstly, the authors discribes a simple process in a really long winded manner, makingit a bit confusing to the beginner in the subject. Then the price of this book costs a bombshell for us students, i would recommend publishing a paperback version to save up costs on publishing, and there fore reduce the selling cost for this book . The book (not suprisingly) really heavy and bulky to carry around,(this would be perfect for you weightlifting guys carrying weights(i give it an additional star for helping me to exercise my muscles) as this book could be your useful tool to it. My opinion, the author should compress the information and get straight to the point when explaining a particular matter in order to reduce the number of pages."
2,Novell's Cne Update to Netware 5 Study Guide,"This book is very poorly written for the type of audience it is intended for - existing CNE's. If you're looking for a book filled with important technical information, this is NOT the one. In addition to all the ""fluff"" there are numerous mistakes throughout the book - in both the text and labs. It's obvious that the author did not check to see if the labs would work properly. Don't bother with this one - it's not worth the time or the money."
3,"Send me my $95 please, Dave.","I came (according to CNE testing staff) one question short of passing, having read the author's book. There was no mention of MMPRV/NWPRV for the new NSS file system.Again the version of NetWare Client 2.2 was omitted. Either of those two facts could have kept $95 to burn my pockets.Oh yeah, I finally passed the next day with the CNE5 Update ""Exam Cram"" book, which I skimmed. Several of their sample test questions showed up where I least expected them (including MMPRV and 2.2).You chances of passing the certification test are about 60%, if you rely on this book. But, for Information Highway skyway with villains (none of whom appeared on the real test) this book has no equal.Is there an agreement between the author and Novell to withold pertinent information? Or has George Washington and Luke Skywalker inched ot the real certification data."
5,"Excellent, slow paced movie like the good old days","This literally takes place, like, around the fireplace of a cabin. No flashbacks, no special effects. 87 minutes of people talking. That's it. But if you're in the mood for a simple movie about a bunch of friends debating about whether one of the group can be 14,000 years old....well, this is your flick. I thought it was really great, but I'm a fan of slow paced movies. Not boring, just patient."
3,Low Budget,"Very interesting ideas explored in the movie, but difficult to get past the very low budget production. Grainy and jumpy video makes it look less professional then most current TV shows. Not worth the 2.99. Maybe worth a buck."
4,Man from earth,"No thrills, no slight of hand, just a interesting spin on the oldest questions on the planet. Not intended to shake your faith, but a slight tug at the blinders we all seem to wear."
4,Thought Provoking Suprise,"A movie I wanted to share with friends right after it was over. I watched it again with 4 friends less than 2 weeks after I initially viewed the film and they loved it. One of those films were, when I offered to pause it during a fellow viewers bathroom break, she didn't offer a polite ""Oh, thats ok."" You don't want to miss a minute and a couple of times we rewound a portion to hear the dialouge a second (and for me a third) time.A movie that anyone who likes to be challeneged and engage in after film discussion should see."
4,A Marvelous Journey for the Mind!,"This dvd, in the Blu-Ray format, of Jerome Bixby's story ""The Man From Earth"" is an intellectual journey in the land of ""what if?""... No spoilers here, but it will rekindle the sense of wonder you had when you first discovered Asimov or Bradbury, or Levin, or Bixby... It represents the apex of Sci-Fi, the Journey for the Mind, and may well ""Blow your Mind"" along the way. --- Now then, the actual PQ of the Blu-Ray transfer is not very good, but it is watchable for the most part. There are sections of film which appear quite grainy, yet other sections are very clear... the sound is also OK. --- However, I included the last part just to be honest. Please don't let that scare you away from buying this BR DVD... the story more than makes up for the lack of BR PQ. If you allow it to, this movie will really work your imagination..."
5,Beautiful artisan feel.,"These pots have a beautiful artisan feel. I will be using them for a landscape design incuding a flowering bonsai, and am very excited. The firing is beautiful, the simplicity of the design adding to the loveliness of the finished product."
2,yesteryear,"You need a multi region dvd player to see this. It was ok. I saw some episodes in the late 60s as a pre teen. As an adult I must say they were nothing to write home about, There are better things to buy."
5,sepultura beneath the remains,my god what a brutal metal album. this album is for true metal fans. max and igor in their prime. anyone who has never heard them needs to check it out they are the real deal. if you like this check out roots and chaos a.d. then go get the brand new cavelero conspiracy the brothers reunited.
1,Real World applications using EJB,"Beginning on page 17 this book takes the reader on a fantasy trip through the world of EJB and J2EE. I have reviewed this book with fellow consultant from BEA and we have found an alarming number of mis-statements about EJBs. This explains why a high number of application development efforts are are in jepordy. As far as reading, the book is very enjoyable and would rank high as fiction."
4,Gotta Love the Outdoors,"My only complaint with this novel was the fact that Andre had NO problem with Genevieve masquerading as someone else. It seemed a ittle unrealistic that he would even ask her why she did it and would just shrug it off. Other than that, I loved this novel."
1,false advertising?,The picture shows both pieces but only the bottom cushion comes. Not a complete waste of money but it is definitely misleading and useless to have only the bottom pad.
2,What happened?,"It took about 15 years, but Lydon finally sounds like he is behind the times. Acid Drops starts off promising enough, with a hard rocking riff, but then towards the end, the song is ruined by repeated samples the line ""No future..."" from the Sex Pistols' ""God Save The Queen."" Luck's Up is kind of pointless. Cruel is the only track that is truly interesting sonically, with Lydon juxtaposing his low monotone voice with his high squealy voice. God is just a bad, pointless song. By this point I quickly lose interest. Covered and Think Tank are decent, but they don't hit me like songs from 9 or Happy. The rest of it is just boring and monotanous.I don't know why there is such a drop off between 9 and this one. The McGeogh / Dias lineup sounds stale, which is hard to believe after the two previous albums which were dynamic and interesting musically. But also, Lydon doesn't really have anything interesting to say.Overall, TWIN is a disappointing ending to PIL."
5,IT'S ALL AN ILLUSION !,"WOW! Now here is a Great book, I've often been Puzzled by some of the Rhythms I've heard in either Modern Music or some of the Jazz or Fusion Music I've been listening to and I've not been able to figure them out, But finaly here is a book that Explaines much of it, and it's funny that some of these Illusions are quite simple actualy, that is in theory, But in practise they can be very difficult, at least some of them.This Book is for the drumset, I don't play the drumset but bought it anyway because these Rhythm concept can be applied to any instrument.The Book deals with many Rhythm concept like Beat displacement, Modulation, Rhythmic scales and Polyrhythm, ther's a lot of Material here and I must agree with Bill Bruford in his Foreword to the book ""I've got Work to Do"".Other good books that deal with some of these things are ""Rhythm and Meter Patterns By Gary Chaffee"" and ""Polyrhythms by Peter Magadini""."
3,not as pictured,"Just a quick note, the photo makes it look like the carrying case has ariel on it. The case is a cheapy plain pink soft plastic with no 'disney' look to it, it zips shut. You wouldn't want to store the disc in it. Game is fun, my 4 yr old got this for her bday and she quickly mastered it,as far as replaying she has already put this aside to get out the older Barbie Mermaid cd-rom game after one week."
1,thank your lucky stars it's not available,"these two ""hosts"" are a pathetic excuse for television personalities or educators. they made me cringe throughout the show. just be happy the dvd is barely available, you saved yourself some cash and an irritating tv experience."
4,A great YA novel!,"Sisters is just great. It juxtaposes two girls; one is a poor Mexican teenage prostitute, the other an American cheerleader. Their contrast is striking. Finally, they meet. Are they going to help each other? Read the novel, you won't regret it."
1,Foojoy is tasteless,The tea has no taste or aroma of jasmine which is the main reason I bought it. I would not buy again.
1,An absolute HORROR.,"There are those who put out a respectable product. This manufacturer weither has no idea on how to present a dvd or does,t care on the garbage they sell. Always remember cheap is not always a good thing for a prospective customer. My total cost for dvd plus shipping was $7 plus change. The dvd was a silent film without any attempt to restore and made useable. It was almost impossible to see the film and the titles were as clear as mud. I have had trouble with this manufacturer and I hesitated in placing this order: how sorry I am that I did place it. Avoid this brand and check reviews of other manufacturers to see if dvd is a properly prepared film. The one to avoid has a red, white and blue logo at the base of the spine of the DVD. BEWARE. JHR"
5,My three year old has it memorized!,"We saw this book on Reading Rainbow and knew we had to have it. The message is good and it's just such a cute book overall. My daughter loves to have this book read to her before bed, but at this point she is reading it to me because she has it memorized. I am very glad we added this to our bedtime story library."
5,Wonderful example to which children can relate,What a wonderful story about loving to play more than hating to lose. Really impresses upon the young reader the lesson of learning to lose as well as learning to win.
2,Poorly Written,This program has lots of potential however it is lacking in several areas. The first is that there are clitches and if an area is clicked on erroneously then the program freezes. I had to shut down the computer each time and reboot. Also the instructions and some of the games are too complicated for my soon to be 5 year old. Others were really fun for her. The most frustrating however is that I never did figure out what I had to do in Belle's Writing Room to complete this section in preparation for the Surprise Ball (and I have a medical degree). If anyone knows please email me so we can at least see the dress we picked out and the music and dance we created.
3,"Fighting Back When you've been ""Screwed""","I help senior's who have been ""screwed"" by hospitals, doctors and insurance companies and so I look forward to reading new material about how ordinary folks can fight back when abused by big companies and small.Unscrewed is a book worth reading but it falls short of really measuring up to the Ellen Phillip's ""Shocked, Appalled and Dismayed"" seminal very helpful book on dealing with dealers who treat you poorly. Phillip's book contained a lot of options for dealing with misdealings. Burley's book mainly focuses on embarrasing the culprits-not something many would like to do. Phillip' wonderful suggestion of corresponding with the president of the company has reaped many quick and productive responses, especially when CC's went to insurance commissioners etc..Burley's examples are worth reading and his ideas for response are good but his scope of actions is limited. Phillips is better tho' I hear she's currently out of print--beg her to update her book!"
3,following a sort of 'tradition',"with this album FLA had donned guitars in the trend to a more ""American"" style industrial; common path many industrial groups decend upon.Although I'm not complaining, this cd just didn't really turn me on, no I'm not whining b/c I'm a purist and don't like the added guitars, it's just more of a ""been there, done that"" for me."
5,Small USA based business exploring Latin America for opportunity,"Thanks to Dr. Becker for explaining in practical and action oriented detail the growth opportunities in Latin America for my small USA based company. After stumbling onto our first Mexican client, my team and I thought we better learn more about how Latin American business operates. Becker clearly highlights the economic and cultural factors that shape doing business in the region, as well as provides many ""real-world"" tips on how to spot opportunities, avoid pitfalls, and develop long term, profitable customers.An excellent book that provides current market intelligence on Latin America in an easy-to-read form.Chris Slocum"
1,Flimsy and Probably Won't Last,"Trying to replace a heavy duty Rubbermaid large drainer board with the drain channels parallel to the longest side. Unfortunately, Rubbermaid no longer makes the product. The Rubbermaid is heavy duty rubber, nicely supported with a good angle for letting the H2O drain into the sink.The Better Houseware 1480/W is cheaply made with almost no support. Not only is it flimsy, but is so lightweight that I doubt it will last very long under normal home use. I sent it back."
3,Drain board that drains out the end!!!,Have been looking for a drain board for some time but they all drained out the side. Went on line and found this on and it works great. I would have liked to have it in rubbermaid but they are in the side drain mode. The plastic on this is thin but for the price it works fine.
2,Gene Autry 100th Anniversary Collection,Movies are entertaining. Quality of film is fuzzy and in some instances will blur. It looks like a poor transfer from 16 mm film with no restoration.
4,Observed it,The arthor did a good job of capturing the sentiments of that time in our history in the Kansas City area. It was written in a manner that the different principals could be identified and followed.
4,not up to her usual par,"great book that lead to some outsstanding sequels . shows that she knows her craft and has continually developed it. now, for a story about Chance. he is to sexy and irrestible to leave hanging. please finish the series of the mackenzies."
3,"Sarah, Sarah, Sarah....","Both Sarah and Rome are damaged people, she by the cold upbringing dispensed by her parents and he by the tragedy of his wife and sons' deaths. While Sarah found a way to compensate for the absence of love, Rome turned his grief into an intense self focus that influenced every personal choice he made.While I understood Rome's reactions, I found him to be utterly selfish and narcissistic. I'm not sure who Sarah fell in love with as Rome has so few redeeming qualities. Sarah doesn't demand respect so she doesn't receive it.Very interesting but frustrating story. I fear it may be more realistic than I'd prefer. Both characters need therapy."
1,Deserves 0 stars!,"I love Linda Howard but I hated this book! You have Rome who only marries Sarah so he can have regular sex. He treats her like a hooker (except she doesn't get paid), coming to ""her"" room, then leaving when he's done.When she gets pregnant (his fault more than hers) he wants her to get an abortion. A man who lost two children to a terrible accident wants to intentionally get rid of another one? While she's pregnant he won't go near her after she starts to show and never does one kind thing for her. Doesn't rub her back, fix her meals, just basically ignores her. Leaves her to give birth to HIS child alone. Then she is so spineless that she lets him climb back into ""her"" bed afterwards. Worse, she allows him to put her in a position where she hides her child while he pretends it doesn't exist. What kind of mother is she?What kind of creature is he?These are two of the worst characters I've ever read. She is a total wimp and he is a cold-hearted jerk!"
2,a bit disappointed,"The title of this book sound very great. SO I bought it and I might expect too high. The true story of one family who faced the very terrible situation should turn to be an exciting book. But when I turn it from page to page. I didn't quite feel with them especially for the writing style. It was so boring that I have to stop for some time . If you like this kind of stuff. I recommend ""Ädrift""by Stephen Callahan or classic sailing ""Survive the savage sea"". With these 2 books I guarantee you won't be disappointed like I was when I finish this book."
3,"If you want dance metal, go for it","In a genre where the addition of guitars is typically viewed as being more of a transgression than an enhancement, the nature of this single and its corresponding album, Millennium, sound rather unusual in comparison with the rest of Front Line Assembly's catalog to date. Could it be that Roadrunner, the band's then-current record label, had felt it necessary in seeing FLA conform to some extent with their headbanging labelmates? Perhaps Bill Leeb had seriously been considering the merits of an industrial/heavy metal fusion, as if that very concept hadn't already been on many other industrial bands' agendas at the time. Aside from the extra-long Chemical Cauldron Remix of the title track and the exclusive ""Internal Combustion"", the rest of this disc seems rather uninspired for an FLA release and may be the reason for it collecting dust on many a shelf."
1,"Sound, please?","I bought this to replace my niece's garbled-sounding copy. But, surprise, surprise, the new one sounded the exact same garbling! I returned it right away."
1,n.d.a,"Seansp, time out... kids wont like that word, you got to be kidding me. Anyway anyone who says this game is for children and bought and were not happy,is obvius we are talking about Mickey Mouse Game not resident evil... so if you dont like silly, stupid, easy games dont buy this one.... PROXIMO!"
1,Off Key,Belinda Carlisle's video isn't the best one I have seen. It appears that in some places she or the back-up singers are even off key. I have played without the video in my car and that is when you really notice it the poor audio. It is not really worth buying for quality.
5,Great bag,This bag has worked very well for me. I love the top flap opening towards the outside. It is easier to access the camera while wearing the bag. The pockets fit all my lenses and accessories. Now I have room for another lens!
4,Not bad.,"I like:""Chains Of Love """"New Lover """"Stone River """"Homeless""""These Blues""""Motormouth""Really a good album."
1,Warning Does not Convert PDF Files as Advertised,"I bought this software to convert PDF files into Word documents and I am very unhappy with it's performance. It just does not work! It falied at every single PDF file I tried! When I contacted their ""support"" I was informed that it does not work on ""image"" PDF files. I told them that there was no mention of that or any disclaimer BEFORE I bought the product that it wouldn't work on all PDF files - they said ""Too bad"". Horrible product and horrible company."
1,5-star minus 5-star product,"I have to agree with some of the observations here that the glowing reviews of this product are suspect considering it's crappy performance. It seemed to create PDFs for me that were OK. However, when I tried to compress them, they became almost unreadable. One more thing - almost none of the editing tools seemed to work at all. Any time I tried to edit objects or text, the program crashed my system. It seems like its a beta version, not an authentic product. Overall I'd rate this product as a very poor PDF printer driver. I wouldn't buy it when so many superior free products can be found on the web. Just my 2 cents."
4,"A well-mounted, underated chunk of entertainment","So, I suppose you've never heard of this film, RIGHT? Well, I guess it's one of those films that have a brief cult status until everyone suddenly stops thinking about it for some unknown reason. Get what I mean?Richard Boone gives a strong performance as a cemetary owner who has a map in his office of all the tombstones. If the tombstone has a white pin in it, it means that it's reserved; if it has a black pin in it, it means that a dead person already lies beneath the stone. Boone discovers that if he replaces the white pin with a black pin, whoever reserves it automaticly snuffs it. So the map is like one, big voodoo doll.I BURY THE LIVING is very original for it's time (which is probably why not many people pay attention to it). It's a throughly enjoyable film which has a couple of effective moments."
3,I'm 50:50 pleased.,The machine is fast. The two flaws are:1. the paper jams and curls frequently2. the ink is not as bold as the inkjet.I bought the printer for faster and cheaper printing (use a lot of inkjet cartridges) since I do my own printing for classwork (school teacher).
3,COULD OF BEEN SO MUCH BETTER,"The idea behind this book was great. The idea of being abel to see the casting Director was very smart. The authors seemed to leave out alot of the major casting directors that are casting todays top Commercials-Film and Television. Yes, there are several who are a name in the industry that are in the book. Since the authors left out many great people they should now write BOOK 2 and put in more of the Casting Directors That are shaping todays projects and should be noted. Nice attempt though.Those that are in the book do have great insight and recomendations/suggestions for the actor. Not a should have or a must buy unless you have extra money to burn.I would like to mention a great book I did read ""Acting is Everything"" it is very helpfull."
1,WHAT???,"Ok first off i was exited about playing Homeworld 2. ive heard its a great game. i would say the same if i could even play the thing but i cant. This game is annoying just because i cant even get it to play on my mac, it keeps on saying serial code error and give no discription what so ever in helping you. And the website doesnt do much to help either"
1,DOES NOT WORK ON INTEL-BASED MACS,"Great game but false advertising by Amazon! This is a tremendous game! I loved it so much back when I first played it in 2004. But unfortunately I discovered after I got the game that it does not work on modern Macintosh computers. It will only work on PowerPC macs. G4 or G5. So even though the description says it will work with Mac OSX, it won't work with any intel-based Macs. This sucks! I feel that was false advertising on Amazon's part. IF a product has severe limitations like that, then the product description MUST SAY THAT! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,Excellent Video Quality,"Excellent Video Quality, of a true classic. I need 13 more words to submit this review, greep fleeble gnorp skootchaloach"
4,Enjoyable for everyone!,"Shearer's acting is as effortless as her dancing and also just as emotional. As a dancer, I emphatically recommend ""The Red Shoes"" to all dancers and non-dancers, as anyone can relate to this story and appreciate the morals. This film contains fine acting by all three principle stars and the supporting roles, and neatly weaves some beautiful dancing scenes into the story. Highly recommended."
4,"The movie was full of passion, a wonderfull film","I thought the movie was wonderful. As a dancer, I could understand the heroine's deep love for dance. The emotions displayed in the movie were also wonderful. This is a movie I would recommend to anyone who has ever been passionate about something they enjoy doing."
5,Nice replica,My granddaughter is crazy about horses. She collects the statues. This product is well made and pretty realistic. It looks just like the picture.
4,Very enjoyable. Glad I read it.,"Daisy, the main character, seems to be rescued from poverty by her physical beauty more than anything else, but as she gets older (in this case, older doesn't mean wiser) she begins to get into a situation that makes you wondering if she'll ever find happiness...in any form at all.Nora Lofts has so much class! I'd recommend this story just so another person could enjoy an elegant writing style. The story itself is very good, though, and you'll pull for Daisy throughout.My favorite books by this author: The Townhouse, and How Far to Bethlehem."
4,Absolutely fantastic - until the end!,This book was a real page turner. Loved the character development - liked the historical aspect as well. I was very disappointed by the ending though. I would like to rewrite the ending myself!!!! I think Anita Shreve likes her books to end tragically (the only other one I have read is The Weight of Water) but in this case it was unrealistic as well.
4,Intriguing,"A good story with convincing characters and a fully developed plot. This, in my opinion, is one of Anita Shreve's best. I read it quickly, hungry for each word. Vivid descriptions with continuous conflict engage the reader into a seemingly never-ending battle between good and evil during the war, with the background of a beautiful countryside and a painful love affair going on all the while. What more could you ask for?"
5,Fabulous book,"I've read five Anita Shreve novels. Some I've liked better then others. This one was one of my favorites so far. The characters and Shreve's way of writing draws you right in. You feel like you are with them and in their world. Resistance was, for me, the perfect balance of historical setting, love story and intrigue"
4,Couldn't resist Resistance,The more I read of this book the harder it was to put down.Had hoped the main characters would have been reunited but found the ending satisfactory.
4,Hemingway at his best and otherwise,"There are two exceptional stories in this volume: The Snows of Kilimanjaro and The Short Happy Life of Francis Mccomber. Both of these stories satisfied my need for other places and experiences while exploring the familiar ground of long term, mildly satisfactory relationships. The other stories are hit and miss, but still they are Hemingway's and so, if you like his work as I do, they hit the mark more often than they fall short."
2,Mediocre,"I gave a brief try to Hemingway two or three years ago that didn't stick, though I don't remember the volume. Then, the other day, with full-on earnestness, I grabbed up this book. I thought it was pretty simple stuff. He seems to be write absolutely from the gut. Short sentences, bland sentences. Nothing that is deeply thoughtful or even conscious.He is well-known as a macho writer who nonetheless delivered a genius to mass and critical audiences. But I'm not sure I understand how or why. I ought to try one on his famous novels before haranguing the icon, but there is almost no temptation after reading this collection.I give him credit for conjuring up thick clouds of weird, dark emotion over seemingly fleeting events (one story in this collection, ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, does this particularly well), but the balance was a disappointment."
2,Misleading,"Yes of course, Hemingway is a good writer and some of the stories in the book are excellent. However, as a collection, the book is uninspiring and a bit depressing. Choose a different Hemingway book if you need something to read on safari."
5,The perfect transition,Use this for your transition from casual Christian to doing the Book of Acts kinda stuff Jesus told us to do. Great book. Every church needs it.
1,Computer can not locate DDREADER-14,"I gave this reader to my son as a Christmas gift and he tried it out on his father-in-law's system (which he built) and the system can not locate it. When he arrives back at his home, he will contact the mfg for software updates and install it on his system. If he gets it working, I will update this review with information on the fix. If it does not work, it is defective and we will return it for a replacement."
2,Too small for DSLR,"It could be good for compact cameras, BUT NOT FOR DSLR!!! The mini ball head is too little. I don't feel secure putting my Canon XSI on it, even too small for my Canon S5 IS. I ended up giving it away."
4,The follow up to Not Ashamed delivers....,"Another set of catchy pop/dance beats, with 'Shine', 'Spirit Thing', and 'Let it Rain' establishing themselves as the standout tracks. This album is a bit tighter than the last, and the musical maturity of the group is becoming apparent."
3,Had its moments,"I love horror movies, and have watched many good and bad. This movie was solidly in the middle of the pack. The haunted insane asylum may have been done before, but it makes the setting sufficiently creepy. There were some good tension filled scenes that made me jump as well. My biggest problem was the inconsistency in the characters. Their personalities were all over the place (of course I have never been trapped in a haunted building, so who is to say how ones personality may transform). The ending felt a little rushed. Overall I would recommend this movie if you need to kill a couple hours late at night."
4,great movie,"i loved this movie, the actors did a great job and the special effects were great.If u want a great experience watch this movie in the dark alone or with someone, if your a horror movie fan you will love this one. The action starts right away this movie is so creepy u will actually believe your watching the final episode of the grave encounters show."
3,grave enc,I like the way the story started but the ending just dragged on. I knew the story was over after the tech guy got taken.
4,Didn't stick the landing,"I really liked this movie until the last 5 minutes. The scares were a *little* expected - it had a very Blair Witch-y feel to it (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) - but overall it was really entertaining. It was really kinda creepy, and I actually found myself rooting for the characters, which I normally don't do in horror movies. I thought the performances were well done, especially that of Sean Rogerson. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I just hate the old satanic cult trope. It's SO done to death; I really wish horror movie makers would just stop using it. This movie would have been so much better without it. The whole thing was like a really well executed balance beam routine, but they didn't stick the landing."
3,Slow,"This was an okay movie. It is very slow, and at 1 point I almost turned it off, but I kept an open mind and sat through it. I think maybe the last 45 minutes or so were a good watch, but that's it."
1,Lame Encounters.,I was really hoping for something good out of this buzzy little indie horror film.What I got was boring and uninspired and less scary than an actual episode of Syfy's Ghost Hunters.Pass on this one.
1,Not worth it,"Not all that spooky. Less than half the movie in, about every second word is the ""F"" word and so much loud arguing between the cast that you start wishing something WOULD happen to all of them."
4,A fat girl rocks black,"It is good to remember the Band Stand days...It isn't aWest Side Story (Full Screen Edition)!We were young and so was the new music.This movie likeGreasetalks to the 60'swhen rock and roll was the swing.Some people have tried to roll back the clockand turn back time, but these songs andperformances show that isn't really possible.A happy, funny and human movie that is right on time."
5,Non Stop Excitement,The new hairspray is the most exciting funny and entertaining musical since Grease in my opinion.All of the cast member did a excellent job and I can't wait to own my own DVD.
2,*Stick With The Original*,I did not care for this Hairspray.If you want to watch one stick with the original.Ricki Lake was great in the original one.And so was Divine.Watch that one.
4,what are features of shake/shimmy DVD??,"yes, i agree, great movie BUT WHAT ARE THE FEATURES of this 2 disc DVD?what's on the 2nd disc? does anyone know? thanks"
5,One of the best musicals in recent years.,"Hairspray lovingly takes what made the 1988 comedy film and 2002 Broadway Musical a hit and combines them into a movie musical version that sparkles with color, comedy, dance, and music. You cant stop this beat!"
5,Best feel good movie around,"I love this movie, and so does my daughter. We rented movie for our trip. The length of rental was good."
4,Great,Love it. Didn't realize it wasn't in a case tho. That is a slight storage issue because it gets lost inbetween other discs in my cabinet.
5,Very pleased!,"I received my boxset a couple dayts before I thought I would, which was a very nice surprise! It was in perfect condition and my girlfriend loved it when she opened it Christmas morning! :)"
1,Painful to watch,"Fortunately we downloaded this movie to Tivo so we could fast forward to the annoyingly predictable ending. The singing and dancing were fun for about 10 minutes, but this is a truly shallow effort that gets so repetitive you can't bear to watch it anymore. Yuck!!"
1,Boring and Insincere,"The whole family fell asleep watching this one: wife, 3 kids, family dog, me.We thought it would be fun because we laughed so much when we saw the original (the one with Divine).And it marks the end of the civil rights era as far as I'm concerned. The issues are presented in such a light-weight, ho-hum, humdrum way, by such light-weight actors, that it's practically a slap in the face to anyone who really cares about civil rights.I miss Divine."
2,Not as great as the original,"Nothing can compare to the original. Divine was the ultimate Edna Turnblad and Travolta fell short in his interpretaion of the role. I thought the movie was watchable, but the musical numbers were long and drawn out. I fast forwarded through much of the music. Here's hoping that the remake of Grease never happens. No one can compare to the original cast of the movie musical!"
1,a biased piece of trash,"I agree with another reviewer who stated for a film that is supposed to fight stereotypes it sure took shots at a variety of groups. To me it had an in your face anti-white agenda unlike the Broadway production. Having viewed thousands of films in a lifetime, this was without fail the worst piece of biased trash I have ever seen. Some friends rented this and on a visit to their home was subject to it. Terrible."
2,"""HAIRSPRAY"" HAIRNOT","Having seen the original Hairspray on Broadway I was anxious to see the movie version. The musical was nothing but fun and expected the same in the movie. Sadly I felt it was a bit of a let down.I wish now I had rented the dvd rather than buying it. Some great songs were left out of the movie and the ending was changed to name a couple of reasons I was disappointed. The biggest let down was Travolta's role. I felt his character was totally distracting and all i could think of was there is John Travolata dressed in a fat suit. Why they didn't use Harvey Fierstein I will never understand.Nicky Blonsky was great, as well as Queen Latifah. Just my opinion, but I say rent it first."
2,Too complicated,"The idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good, but in practice ZoneAlarm is too intrusive for most home computer users. It seems to have bugs too, starting with an installation that initially wouldn't work on one of the computers on my home LAN. ZoneAlarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered. I haven't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall ZoneAlarm yet, but I'm close!"
2,An O.C.D. anti virus program,"I have used this program for a couple of years and it is really annoying. First, I hate its updates, its locking my machine when it decides to do an update, stops Acrobat from running, stops the whole the machine if I step away and here is the worst.. it checks itself and stops its own scanning program from launching. Norton finally looking good again!"
1,Buyer beware,"I installed this 2 days ago. It installed easily enough...within less than 5 minutes I was doing my first virus scan. It only found one infection, which I don't think is accurate (I think it missed some stuff). Every time...*every* time you connect to the internet or go to a site it will come up with a popup asking you to allow or deny access. Gets very annoying after a while. The last straw came today, when I could sign on to the internet but not access any sites. I ran my Spyware Doctor and my Adaware, they both came up clean. On a whim I uninstalled the ZoneAlarm, and voila my internet starts zooming along smoothly again. This was a total waste of money for me, I only wish I had kept the receipt so I could return it."
5,Great Upgrade! Improved features and New Features Worth The Price,I can't add much to the previous reviews. However i do want to point out that disc spanning is not supported if you use the remote burning feature. If you try to burn to a remote computer you will get an error message saying you can't span discs. I was trying to not have to upgrade the DVD/CD hardware in an older Mac on my network by using the remote burning feature.Other than that Toast 7 meets all my needs.
3,"Handy Reference, However Does NOT Contain Lexicons","Anyone who uses Strong's Concordance regularly has undoubtedly come to rely on the lexicons for a deeper understanding of the Holy Scriptures. This edition contains only the first part of Strong's, that is, the verse citations by keyword.This is a great volume for young students or for those who are not interested in the original languages of the books of the Holy Bible.Others would be better served by investing in the unabridged New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible and a separate dictionary."
3,good for a first bible dictionary,Not what I expected and it looked used and I thought I was buying new. It did not have the information I was hoping it would have. It was very general nothing special.
3,"Low cost for capacity, but rather slow transfer speeds","I'm a graduate student and purchased this for use moving files to and from campus, and I'll use it for transferring any kind of file actually.In making this 2GB unit, it is assumed the user will *use* the 2GB of space and might want to transfer some pretty large files now and again.Transferring a 107 megabyte music folder from this Memorex drive onto a new computer took about 5 minutes. This is a shabby transfer rate, and does not seem to be in accordance with the specifications listed on the Amazon page (6mb/sec read).If you are not too concerned with speed issues, this is a good drive for the price in my opinion."
5,Nice drive,"I've had this for a couple of months now andI'm very pleased. Got it for 89 dollars after rebate.The drive is fast copying files and has a good feel to it.My only criticism is that the cap is easy to misplace, butthat's my problem.Recommended"
2,Not as good as series,"Like most the reviews I to had problems with the quality. It had snow throughout and many scenes were so dark you had to struggle to make out what was happening. Although Ginger has never been one of my favorite characters, Tina Louise was missed. This actress could not fill her shoes. Her voice was forced and she was terrible with delivering her lines. I guess after being apart for so long everyone had a hard time getting into the Gilligan spirit. It is a must if you are a true fan, it answers a few questions. Unfortunatly you will have to suffer the poor quality."
3,I still don't get it,Why didn't Ginger pack a two way radio? I mean she packed a full make-up kit and tons of clothes. And why do Gilligan and the Skipper not have a change of clothes? They were the ones who lived on the boat.This movie makes no sense. And it ends with them getting stuck on the stupid island again. However it's trippy and fun in a mystery science theater sort of way....
1,5 stars for the movie 1 for this DVD pressing,"They ruined a great movie.Like the other reviewers, watching it on cable gives a cleaner/intact version than this dvd. But for a couple of bucks, its ok for a die hard fan. Just wish they would release a box set of all the movies."
2,Tape was in poor condition,"The story was typical Gilligan's Island fare, so that was fine. The problem was in trying to enjoy the story, with a poorly reproduced video tape."
2,Great Movie Poorly put on DVD,"Im gonna give this DVD 2 stars not 1,only because i happen to love it.Some scenes were cut out,why ill never know.The reviews about this being Poor quality were spot on.But i could put up with that if they had the entire movie,because it is cheap.But why would they put it on DVD with cut out scenes?That realy is annoying.Then to realy add insult to injury they put on some other stuff not worth watching.But upon saying all that i hadnt seen the movie for so many years i couldn't wait to see it.And i must say i did enjoy it.5 stars for the movie,which in my opinion was the best of the 3 movies.But it loses 1 star for the poor quality and 2 for the cut out scenes even if 98 per cent of the movie is here."
1,Not True To Original Show,"If you loved Gilligan's Island give this dog a miss. It was obviously thrown together by someone who did not know or care for the original tv show. For instance, Gilligan goes to save the Howell's dog(?) who has never been mentioned and does not exist. The Skipper does not mention his favorite foods he will eat upon getting rescued but babbles about girls instead. Ginger is played by someone different who has a voice like Rocky the Flying Squirrel. If you miss Gilligan and the gang, watch the old shows again, not this piece of crud."
3,Movie,"The Dvd came in perfect condition (was never opened), but the age of the Dvd showed at times when the picture quality got really poor and the images were hard to see during certain scenes."
2,Casting About,I love documentaries but Casting About did not shed any new light on the subject. Unfortunately I am cannot recommend this movie
3,it was ok,"Not what I expected, seemed to me to be dated and easy ending. Book was very short and could have a lot more detailed."
4,Cop Hater,Ed McBain has another 87th precinct book. It's a fun read and written well. Some of this book is a little in left field but still a nice easy read.
2,Cop hater,"Okay, not one of the better 87th precinct stories. Needed more suspense. I would not recommend this book to friends."
3,Cop Hater,"Interesting as a historical look at the early years of the genre. Disappointingly short, no substantial subplots beyond Carrara'.s romance with his mute girl friend, and no unexpected twists or turns."
1,An incredible embarrasment,"This is pure drivel, catering NOT to Christians, but only to theabsolute LUNATIC FRINGE.Ridiculous, on every level, from it's misguided theology and half-bakedeschatology to it's high school level script, ponderous acting,amateurish direction, lighting, audio and cinematography. The only goodthing about this movie is it's length. Short enough for concernedChristians to critique in classes about heresy and also short enoughfor atheists, agnostics and non-believers to get a good laugh.REAL Christans won't find this movie enlightening. It has absolutely NOtheological value and is an embarrassment. This movie very rightlycauses derision by agnostics, atheists and non-believers because it isso incredibly bogus. This is the ""Reefer Madness"" of the End of Times"
4,Fear Factory has done it again!!!,"This album is an unexpected new approach that Fear Factory has taken. They've remixed their 1995 release Demanufacture into somewhat of a techno-core album. Remanufacture features some famous techno artists that have remixed Fear Factory's Demanufacture to fit their style. Even Fear Factory tried their hand at techno remixing for such songs as Remanufacture (Demanufacture) and National Panel Beating (Body Hammer). Most of the songs are surprisingly good for remixes, but nothing can beat the pure hard core sound of Demanufacture."
2,mat-black flame half helmet,"it's a nice looking helmet, and aside from the chinstrap, it fits well too. i read a review before I bought the helmet, and I agree w/ that review. the chin strap is in the wrong place, so it's more of a choker, than anything else. additionally, at highway speeds, chinstrap will loosen up, and the helmet will try to slide off; trying to readjust the chinstrap is near impossible. then the quick release on the chinstrap is unreliable; it holds securely when riding, you don't have to worry about that, but when you try to remove the helmet, maybe the quick release will release, maybe it won't.in the end, the only problem with the helmet is the chinstrap, but there are 3 problems that i've had with the chinstrap, and unless the manufacturer can correct those deficiencies, your money is better spent on a different product.mike"
3,Durable Helmet,"Do yourself a favor, get a DOT certified Helmet. Safety First.This one is a good choice the only complain I have is that the painting goes off very easy."
5,Vipassana Meditaion Course Summary,This book contains the lectures given during a 10 day Vipassana course. Great book to read if you are curious as to what is taught during the meditation training.
4,spooky,"It's been a long time since I bought this album, but it still remains one of the spookiest ever. A perfect album to play in the dark on Halloween night while you're playing Ouija board or somethings. OOOOOOoooo! Plus the music is good too. Not as good as Abigale, but worth getting nonetheless."
4,Scroll Saw projects,"Easy to understand and follow. A great book for the intermediate worker, not the very beginner.Takes you to another level of woodworking Recommended."
3,Ilium - Paint By Number,"A short EP from the Hefty Records trio Ilium. After a abstract rhythmic intro, PAINT BY NUMBER quickly settles into quiet post-rock. Melodic enough to be engaging (""Ochre,"" for instance), the short running times is both a strength and a weakness. The tracks don't overstay their welcome, but also seem underdeveloped, with most tracks shifting tempo midway through. Certainly not the worst way to spend 20 minutes of your day."
3,Long but kinda worth it,this book was very long and hard for me to get through but in the end it was worth it if your in to reading long beggains in books that dont get good until the end
2,A first time author would never be able to get this to print,"Will Sandra Cisneros always be our token Mexican? Will she always get away with mediocre writing? My suspicion is yes, she will. My husband and I enjoyed bits of the book--Cisneros has a good ear for dialogue--but much of the book was painfully obvious and pointless. It felt self-important with that midwestern writer workshop aura to it and everytime a character enters a room he/she must list the contents of the room. We listened to this on a road trip and it might have made the trip that much longer. I also had a copy of the book--which I recommend over the audio (to avoid the screechy whiney voice). Unfortunately, Chicana lit. rises and sets with Ms. Cisneros when it would do better to spotlight Viramontes or Castillo or even Denise Chavez for that matter. Don't let her kid you. Cisneros is not our Shakespeare, she is our Danielle Steel."
3,Never take personal security for granted.,"I've been relying on advice from this book and ""Most Dangerous Places"" for several years now. Although I wouldn't call it my ""gospel"" there are a lot of useful pieces of information that could save your life. Although I am not constantly exposed to life-threatening danger, my experience shows me that most accidents and mishaps occur to tourists because they drop their guard or get complacent. My advice is simple. Don't be paranoid, but never take personal security for granted - even if you are just going to the local shops..."
1,Waste of Time,"Don't waste your money on this book. This book tries very hard to be amusing without succeeding, nor does it really tell you anything of any use. This is the first review I have written, but this book is so bad that I felt that I had to write one."
3,"Ehhh, could be better...","I bought this camera as a replacement for my Casio Exilim Ex-Z40. The price was right, all the reviews seemed decent, but I am not nearly as satisfied with this camera as I was with my Casio. I have experimented a lot with this camera and I can never get true-to-life colors with it. People always seem really washed out, and the night picture settings only work if you have a tripod. The pictures are often slightly blurry, plus the battery doesn't last long enough for me. The screen isn't that big, and there are way too many buttons for people other than me to figure out. The only thing I do like about this camera is how good the red-eye setting is. Either way, my next camera will definitely be another Casio, or a Sony."
2,Very hard to read,My grandfather's division (the 94th ID) was one of the ones committed to containing the Germans in Lorient and St. Nazaire and I was hoping that this book would provide some additional information on that fight (I have had little luck so far). Unfortunately this book can be characterized as being repetitious and disorganized. Although there are some interesting first-hand accounts and some good facts here and there it reads as if the author wrote it down as he learned it. There are entire pages devoted to some obscure WWII education program and how many privates were released from colleges in time to serve in France after D-Day.... and? The author never explains the significance of this. It's very frustrating.
4,TP2.COM,I Like the cd but I don't think that it better than the original 12play. I think 12play will always be a classic to me
1,Play better tennis in 2 hours,"You could play better tennis in 2 hours,if you loaned this book to your opponent and he read it.If you have decent strokes and have played tennis for years,this book may have you start over and change everything. Not your standard strokes,decided that this approach would do me more harm then good. It could be a good book for a beginner or someone who wants a drastic change."
4,King Diamond Live shows his brilliance,"Live in 87 shows what I consider the peak in King Diamond's career. I love these songs from Abigail live. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the foolish ommisions of ""The Black Horsemen"" and ""A Mansion in Darkness"" which are two of his finest moments. I'd love to hear them live, but despite, this is excellent highlighting the brilliant guitaring of Andy LaRocque who I consider the ""Rhoads of the late 80's"". Great album from a great band that stands the test of time even today."
4,Illuminating,"The author is sincere and direct to the point. To avoid every illusion, he warns his readers that the book is not ""a typical self-help book"" and therefore, does not ""promise miracle."" The fact that the author makes no presumption, makes it possible for him to be down to earth and therefore, convincing. The question whether Enneagram makes sense or not, is a question ones needs to answer after going through the book and after having understood his/her personality type. The only proof of Enneagram's accuracy is to have identified your own personality. And I think this is itself a miracle. The historical survey of Enneagram is objective. Personally, I found the book very useful. Discover your self by discovering the contents of this book. Spend your money for it and you will earn a lot because this book is very illuminating."
5,Very thorough and informative,This is one of the most comprehensive books that offers descriptions and other helpful information about the personality types. Highly recommended.
3,Rare Mix Tracks...But Random Ones Too!,For some odd reason they put the most random songs on this album like Mindphaser & Iceolate & No Limit...for no limit it said Disintegration Mix from the amazon music samples... but when you get the cd it's just the origral No Limit don't ask me why it's not a mix! the up side is it his some good remix tracks my favorites are Digital Tension Dementia (Contagion Mix)& The Blade (Pro-Gress Mix) Heatwave - Target - Toxic.. i think are unreleased tracks. Front line assembly fans could pass on this one!
4,Rattler one-seven,"As a former Vietnam helicopter pilot, I lived a similar life in ""Nam"" so I know the story was factual and well written. The author was single minded in getting home alive and keeping those flying with him as safe as he could make it for them. I enjoyed his professionalism in flying and striving to be the best in a bad situation. The combat assualts were great and I was ""in the cockpit with him"" as he described the action. Good reading for vet and non-vet alike as to what it was like to be in a true airmobile war."
4,I'm confused,"Good read. A bit like a diary but still tells an effective story.What I am confused about is Fast Teddy. It is not difficult to research who he was. A simple search for Rattler 6 and the matching dates for the 71st will bring him up. I found he was awarded the DFC for the operation at LZ Delta and that due to his ""courage"" and unloading his supplies, LZ Delta was prevented from being overrun. This is the opposite of what Chuck described and further research has uncovered that Chuck is indeed accurate.How then did Fast Teddy get the award?"
3,Rattler 1-7,"The book is almost a diary, to many unnecessary facts and people. Other than that a good read if you want to know about flying choppers in Nam........"
3,it's just ok.,"this is where they started the weird tribal crap. stick with ""beneath the remains"" and ""arise."""
2,yawn,this cd is about has heavy as a group of geriatric nuns at the convelesant home with harmonicas.
4,Melissa has redeemed herself!,"After being oh-so-disappointed with Melissa's book The Breakup Club, I was thrilled to read this charming novel about two teenage girls who, in a way, switch places for six weeks. Theodora is a teen actress headed down Lindsay Lohan's path and fast. Emily is an invisible sixteen year old living in Dora's hometown. When Dora's publicist arranges for her to live with Emily's family for six weeks to film a reality show, both girls' lives change and they're forced to re-examine everything and learn a lot about themselves. I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put it down. I think she could even pull out a sequel!"
2,Good But Not Great,There is a couple really good songs on here but if you're paying more than $5 for the cd you might as well buy the 2 or 3 singles frim iTunes
3,Good for substitute teachers,"Some great prompts in here, but not enough. There are too many I wouldn't use, even as a substitute. Still, this would be very handy to whip out if there is no lesson plan. These prompts don't have to be used in just English class, I think you could find one that relates to any class you are in."
5,Great for writing centers!,I use this book in my writing centers for third grade. It offers unique writing prompts that take the boring out of writing.
1,DO NOT BUY,"It broke on the second day and the 'different' sounds all sound the same. And the sounds are highly annoying, akin to fingernails on a chalkboard. Big waste of money and big disappointment for my son."
4,Lots of fun!,"This is a cute and fun novel about the lives of various Londoners who live in the same apartment complex. The reader is first introduced to three roommates -- Jem, Ralph and Smith. There is a fun twist when the characters in the book fall for one another. Ralph has fallen in love with Jem, whereas Jem might have fallen in love with Smith. But Smith has a secret crush on his neighbor, Cheri. Cheri, however, has set her eyes on a married man who lives in the same building. Things take a hilarious turn when Ralph hosts a party.This book is meant to be read for fun. The book is entertaining and the characters are likeable. You will definitely relate to the characters of this book if you have ever had neurotic roommates!"
3,Ralph's Party,"I can't say this book was great, can't say it was bad either. It was just ok. This is the 2nd Lisa Jewell book I have read & I am not impressed. There are far better writers in this genre. This was a story about an apt building & the lives of several of the tenants. Nothing new here and quite predictable."
2,90210 For Adults,"I read this book on the basis of its reviews on this site. I was utterly disappointed. I felt like I was watching a really bad episode of Beverly Hills 90210 set in England! I stuck with it, however, and at least read the only good part---Ralph's actual party."
3,"Pleasant read, but little to chew on...","I happen to go out of my way to buy British novels, and was hoping this one to stay in line with all the rest. Though the novel is written in a light and happy way, there isn't much else to say about it as far as content goes. I suppose if you are looking to buy a book with few conflicting characters, and little to no action, this would be your read. I found it disappointing, and was happy to put it back on the shelf..."
2,"Boring, overly dramatic","I first read Lisa Jewell's second book, ""Thirty Nothing"". I found it highly predictable and was about to give up on this author when I read so many positive reviews about ""Ralph's Party"", so I decided to give it a try. Well, I was definately disappointed. The characters are shallow, bitter, untrustworthy and unrealistic. Most scenes were overly dramatic, like a really bad soap opera.... by the time I got to the part where Ralph was organizing his party, I had to stop reading it. It was just too much garbage.I don't know how people can compare this with Bridget Jones's Diary. It's not even in the same category! Bridget Jones is funny and witty. Lisa Jewell's novels are stupid, predictable and not even remotely funny. They are just a waste of time."
1,Don't bother...,"I love ""chick lit"" books. For some reason this was just painful to get through. I usually read a book in a few days and this one took me 2 months. I hated all the characters. They were just awful."
1,Deservedly Outcast,"Conrad must have shuddered from yonder heaven when this miserable adaptation graced the screen. That such prestigious actors should prove so totally incapable of portraying with some semblance of integrity such great characters and that the director could permit-or initiate- such a total ""rape"" of this great work speaks volumes on the cultural level of Film today. I had hoped to use it in my class but I will stick to ""Apocalypse Now""."
2,WHAT IS IT?,"LOOKS LIKE POTTERY, THE INSIDE FEELS LIKE POTTERY, BUT THE OUTSIDE RAISED EMBLEMS FEELS LIKE ?CAN'T DESCRIBE. THE FEATHERS FEEL REAL, THE SWADE WRAPS ARE STRETCHY AND THIN...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR...IT LOOKS INTERESTING AND WORKS O.K. IN MY NATIVE AMERICAN DEN, AS LONG AS THE POT STAYS IN THE HUTCH BEHIND THE GLASS. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW WHAT THE MATERIAL IS WITH THIS POTTERY?"
5,No reason not to pick it.,Its cheap and holds on tight to your canisters. This convienient cap also holds an extra O-Ring. What more could you ask for?
3,"Music:4 stars, Singer:1 star.","This has some of the best riffs ever. With songs that Metallica covered(Satan's Fall, Curse Of The Pharohs, Evil, Into The Coven), this is truly old school. But the singer is HORRIBLE! All That AAAA! and groaning make him extremly laughable and embarassing. But the guitarists and other musicians RULE! All in all, ok. 3 stars."
2,Melissa is a must have - the ORIGINAL not the remastered,"Melissa is an amazing album.That said, this remastered version is very subpar. The songs don't sound right. They sound much weaker and too modern. ""Satan's Fall"" has been altered structurally and is far inferior to the original. The changes made simply do not make sense and ruin the momentum of the song. Listen to both versions and you will see what I mean."
5,classic fate,"Unbelievably sweet. sounds better now than it did back then. pure dark metal, arranged well, performed exceptionally.Happy Halloween, Ole Bang.fugfar"
4,A Black Metal Classic,"This is a true classic -- I listened to this when it was first released and was blown away by the awesome metal riffing on this recording. For me, King Diamond's high-pitched vocals have always been the least-liked element in his records, but they still possess a unique, compelling quality that kind of grows on you the more you listen.The only reason I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5 is the production, which is okay, but not up to today's standards. Anyone listening to Metallica's cover/medley of songs from this album will notice the difference in the guitar sound and quality of the recording. However, production aside, this is a GREAT metal album, and a must-have for any lover of the genre. If you're going to pick one Mercyful Fate album to get, this is it."
4,mercyfulvetren,"one of the best albums that mercyful ever recorded however if you could find a used cd on the original ""megaforce"" label , pick up that copy, because after roadunner got the rights to this album the title track of the album was remixed and all the dark erie overdubs were taken away and now the song is completly ruined."
5,Melissa is one of THE BEST metal albums out there,"King Diamond does an incredible job hitting those high and low vocals and that is not even half of it. The guitar is one of the best I have ever heard. Sure Diamond can be whiney sometimes but the guitar is incredible. Especially in ""Into The Coven"", ""Evil"" and ""Curse of the Pharaohs"". I am not sure about Mercyful Fates later music but their music from the 80s still rocks today"
5,Best Cook Book Ever,"I have had this cookbook for 9 years now. I order it when it is available for gifts. Between my daughter and I, we have made just about every recipe, all to excellent reviews by family and friends. The pictures are great. The recipes are awesome. Even if they call for unusual ingredients, they all turn out very tasty dishes."
1,Bad design,"I purchased the Rio Karma because of the price and for a 20 gig MP3 it was a great deal, but that's where the great deal ended. The player itself is great! It is very user friendly, but it has one extremely bad design flaw, the power button location. It is located on the top of the player next to the headphone jack and it is so dam touchy. The player I purchased powered on and off by itself and when you hold the player in your left hand your thumb is right on top its extremely sensitive power button so you tend to turn it off very easily. I got so frustrated with the dam thing that I sent it back. The bottom line is this, if you want an inexpensive 20 gig MP3 player, this is your baby, just remember, you get what you paid for! No wonder Apple is putting these people out of business."
3,Just Okay,"It worked great for about 4 weeks, then continually freezing, and at the present time will not work at all. i would recomend spending a extra 50- 75$ on something reliable, also the support from rio is VERY VERY slow and a hassle. The Rio Karma frustrates me."
2,Defective on delivery,"I've read about these players... and how good they are. I've also read about how bad the hard drives in them are. I recently decided to buy a remanufactured unit from Amazon, hoping for a good unit for half the price. It had a defective hard drive when I got it. It's also very worn out. I think, according to the serial code, it's just about 2 years old.I thought about trying to return it, but I also read about how extremely bad RMA service Rio USA had when they were still in business. Now they've gone out of business, so I won't even try taking my chances with them. But all hope is not out, because you can swap out the hard drives yourself, and even put bigger ones (up to 60GB) in there instead. It's just too bad that the new 30 and 60GB drives are pretty hard to find.So I really don't reccommend this remanufactured deal, unless you're willing to take the chance of having to disassemble the unit and putting a new drive into it."
5,Grooovy,"After reading the reviews for this film, you will realize that Zachariah is a ""Love it or hate it"" phenomenon. If you can't appreciate camp, then you have no business watching this one. I am in the ""Love it"" category myself. For me, the Elvin Jones drum solo is enough reason to buy this one. I am also a fan of Country Joe, and I enjoy all the music in this one. The fiddler's tune always sticks in my head for days after I hear it. Of course, the acting is horrid. You have to expect that (Although Elvin Jones is surprisingly good). The homo-eroticism is a bit silly, but so is everything else in this one. The Herman Hesse connection really takes it to another level. It amuses me to no end that this silly romp is based on a serious work of literature and is remarkably true to the original (Except for the ending)."
4,You missed the point,The plot is a parody of Hermann Hesse' Siddartha. It is the life story of Gautama Buddah. This novel was very popular in colleges in the late 60's and early 70's
5,Inspiring,"Fantastic refresher for seasoned actors and a must have for beginners. It's not only for auditioning, rekindled my passion for the work and helped me refine my art."
3,Sophomore Slump,"Blue Mountain's classic debut album, ""Dog Days"" remains one of the best alternative country albums ever released. Unfortunately, the follow up album ""Homegrown,"" doesn't hold up to the high standard the band had set for itself. Things start off quite strong, particularly on the mid-tempo rockers ""Myrna Lee"" and ""Pretty Please"" that are tracks 2 and 3. After that, however, the proceedings get much more hit or miss. ""Last Words of Midnight Clyde"" is a burner and ""It Ain't Easy to Love a Liar"" lives up to its title, but ""Generic America"" is a failed political statement and some of the songs late in the proceedings sound like filler material.Before their unfortunate breakup, Blue Mountain at their best were a force to be reckoned with. On ""Homegrown,"" however, they are at their best only intermittantly."
5,funny,These guys are funny. Kind of pricey at the time to purchase the complete series plus CD. The CD only has 6 songs. To save money I should have purchased the complete series without CD. The 6 songs are:Business TimeIf You're Into ItI'm Not CryingThe Most Beautiful Girl In The Room (Live)Banter (Live)Robots (Live)I see the price for the complete series with CD is drastically reduced compared to what I paid. Whether you buy the complete series with or without the CD doesn't matter. You still get a good deal and looks like free shipping.
5,"""Your beard is good.""","Love the show, love the deal. Got this deal for less than the new package their selling of the complete collection with seasons 1 and 2 combined. It's a great show, meant for music lovers with a dry sense of humor! Gotta love it."
3,Ok - very basic,"Book is extremely basic. I have been training for over 20 years, maybe I expected to much? Still an ok book though for youth that need to understand the basics. Good book, just not for advanced levels or what I would call "" The Ultimate Guide""."
4,"PRETTY COOL! (MAKES '9"" SOUND LIKE A JOKE!)","This album is pretty damn cool. The singing gets annoying but the music makes upfor it. Its too bad that there's only one musician from the original Mercyful Fate (Hank) still in the band today. Compared to this one ""9' is a joke."
5,This is Mercyful Fate's finest album. A classic.,"This is Mercyful Fate's most mature work. King Diamond's vocals are spectacular. Mike Denner and Hank shermann are two of the better axemen in the business. A Dangerous Meeting, Gypsy and the classic Come to the Sabbath create a strong core for the album. The Oath is an eerie sound effects piece which is one of Mercyful Fate's finest songs, instrumentally and vocally. This is a must-have for any metal fan."
5,Godhead,"Melissa was a fantastic underground metal album and a super-stylish debut for Mercyful Fate. But Oath is bloody godhead! This time around the arrangements are tighter and the whole affair comes off as much more focused and menacing. Guitarists Michael Denner and Hank Sherman weave a wicked sonic tapestry of gothic riffs and harmonies, which are occasionally enhanced by some truly eerie keyboard parts. The superb rhythm section (Kim Ruzz on drums, Timi Hansen on bass), meanwhile, execute dozens of meticulous rhythms and time changes on a dime. And King Diamond is at his theatrical best, conjuring demons, lost souls and black magic with his ghostly symphony of voices. One of the best albums and bands of 1980s metal."
2,I will not buy again,"I am giving two stars because this product does give my hair a textured look, but the negatives far outweigh the positives. Negatives include dull color, dry damaged hair that feels like straw, and frizzy fly aways."
1,Waste of free download,"The author of this material seems more interested in spouting her sexists opinions tha laying out good advice and strategy. She spends much of her time trying to work out her deep resentment of men. I kept reading and reading thinking at some point she would get past all the garbage and get to the point, but it did not seem to be forthcoming. I finally just deleted this waste and spent monye on a book that actually helps without all of the personal editorial and sexism.Skip this one."
4,Good Stuff,"My Mom has me buy it for her by the Gallon since she has leg cramps at night.Great stuff. I also use it when I get back, knee or ankle pains.I highly recommend it!!!Thanks,Mike"
2,RIP Obituary,I'm basing this review on growing up with Cause of Death & Slowly We Rot...this album is not even close to these classic albums and should be avoided if you're looking for the classic sound.
3,how many times they gonna put the same songs on a new album,geez you think they could put download and chopped in half on one more album this is their LOAD(metallica) every band has one like CARCASS'S pathetic SWANSONG and LED ZEPPLIN'S IN THROUGH THE DOOR THINGY ALBUM all bands suck at one point once you go down you never get back LOAD albums mean the end of the magic and the beginning of a different band with the same name it was cool while it lasted a couple of cool songs but not a rauncy as others
5,Buy the tape and buy his stock Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B),"If your into Berkshire Hathaway stock watch this tape. This tape will help you gain confidence in the CEO of BRK. It shows a man who has great integrity, who you can trust to manage your money through the Berkshire Hathaway stock. Warren Buffett doesn't claim to always make the right decision and is willing to explain his mistakes. It makes me feel that he will always try to do the best he can possibly do for the company."
5,Wonderful!,"This book tells the story of a man who rode his bicycle across the northern route of the U.S.,from Seattle to New York City. But it tells more. We are included in reminiscences of the authors early farm life as well as his apprection of nature. His narration takes us with him into headwinds, up incredible grades, and down hills with rewarding tailwinds. What comes out overall is this mans love of like and his country."
4,Doggie Dental,"These petite chews, which are more suited for toys breeds, are a good treat that also helps to clean your dog's teeth. I've experimented between the petite and small size chew and found, that for my dogs, the petite is preferred. They can actually consume these, which they do, rather quickly. That's the only down side...they don't last long. The price here at Amazon is much better than what my vet charges for these, even with shipping, if you buy several packages at a time."
3,Satanic Brutality,"Deicide are the most notorious of the bands out there but not compared to the likes of the Norwegian headbangers as Mayhem.You are fine to say you love or hate them but you should give them the credit.It's lead by bassist/growling vocalist Glen Benton,the guy who branded his own forehead with a inverted cross,brothers as Eric and Hoffman and frenzied double kick bass drummer Steve Asheim. They are on duty but the true masters behind all of this was Venom and the Possessed,the guys from the the dawn of the eighties.The favourite songs I picked out were''serpents of the light'' which starts out with a intro ofdemon noises,''this is hell were in'',''I'am no one'', and ''Slave to the cross''.In that song ''I'am no one'' I think they were talking about Satan because he was once the chiefangel but expelled from heaven for his rebellious pride but hewasn't a soul.Be warned it has the attack of Satanic metal andDeicide lyrics might be too evil for others to handle."
1,a sacreligious mess,"I simply hate Deicide. I might be a metalhead, but I agree with many of the other reviewers. Death Metal is probably the best genre out there, but these guys are evil and really mean it. I'm a Christian (weird, because I'm also a huge metalhead), and I just can't believe the stuff I hear on this and all of the other Deicide albums. If you think Slayer or Slipknot are Satanic bands, just wait till you hear these people. Slayer's most recent album, ""God Hates Us All"", was a schitzophrenic mess which proved to me that Slayer no longer has the talent they used to, and Slipknot's most devilish cry yet was ""people = S***"". Any band like Deicide are living demons. I can't see why a band wants to be so evil. These guys want to be evil, so let them. They'll just fall victim to the scathing critizism they deserve. If you want good death metal, check out Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Death, Carcass, Meshuggah, or Arch Enemy. Deicide belongs in a category all of their own: blasphemy."
2,Lost in Translation? Maybe Erotica Means Bland Tweaky House Elsewhere ...,"Something is definitely lost in the translation. I'm not sure where on Earth tweaky, bland house beats that barely pass muster as house tracks gets labeled ""Erotica,"" unless of course, it's all just made up marketing to sell you some CD's - but as actual erotica dance tracks - um, no.There are a couple decent house tracks here that could pass muster as erotica house chill but just a couple in a massive collection of tracks. If you're a DJ at a club and you need some tracks to use as transitions or take these as raw building blocks to build something more - then these tracks have enough material for you to do something with them but as a dance CD to listen to or to drop ready-to-go ... um, no."
2,RUINS TAPE,"Ruins everything that has adhesionistic properties. I KNOW this, because I ruined my daughter's tape, my tape, my cat's tape, and all our macceroni art. We have many years of macaroonii art. My daughter cried for 14 hours. No real life applications but--if mixed with a bottle of glue, totally disappears. Like -0. Good for magic tricks, not for macarooni art. Now I can't show my macarooni art to Barnie Fark! He was proud when I saw him in my head. We just wanted to remove one Macarooni from the Macarooni Lisa, and ruined it...Here's a list of complaints besides the above singlegraph.Cannot refill product, or put the anti-adhestionistic spray in can a second time, nor can I enjoy the can after the product has been ejactulated since the anti-adhestionistic has taken all our macarooni."
4,True Courage,Remarkable story about a true American hero. A very detailed look at the Vietnam War from the perspective of a POW.
2,Not So Much,"Too much of the book is just Blythe taking an opportunity to spew vitriol about Duke--not just the team, but everything from its campus to its students.His attempt to look at the rivalry with detachment falls short, and the overall effect is that he's simply immature."
1,Kinda pointless,"Short version: Once you get to know JJ Redick, Coack K and just about any Duke fan you will discover that they are pretty nice folks, funny and sometimes cry when recalling the memory of their dead mother (K). No kidding Mr Blythe. Note to Dukies---pretty sure Dean Smith is an ok guy also. Perhaps someone should cash in and write a ""Heel Hate"" book real quick.This book could be helpful to the few idiots in every fan base who post on team message boards around the clock."
5,Great Fun!,Even Duke fans won't be able to put down this entertaining analysis of the Duke-Carolina rivalry. Find out what's behind the bad blood between the two schools.
4,A Complete Guide for Stage Hypnosis,"I enjoyed the book and it was a good read for Christmas plus the techniques about stage hypnosis got me hooked into this industry.Yet when it comes to ""seducing the audience"" I'd prefer more advanced ""Remote Hypnosis"" tactics (i.e. the ""cosmic master"" hypnosis.cosmicmaster.com) whereas you are able to telepathetically influence your ""target"" with mental envisioning.Interesting book but I believe it's more inclined to those who aspire to being professional stage hypnotists. Great book, give it a go if that's what you're looking for; profession or 'hobby'."
5,The best hypnosis book I have every read.,"Fun With Hypnosis: The Complete How-To Guide by Svengali is, by far, the best book on hypnosis I have ever read.It slowly shows the reader the history of hypnosis. It explains how it is used worldwide in the medical community. It then goes through testing; to relax the subject and to test if he/she responds to your commands.After testing, he tells you how to induct a trance, deepen the trance, mulpitle routines you can do, all with great detail and with word for word scripts that get results. After those chapters, hedives into stage hypnotism and odds and ends, followed by a helpful self help section on self hypnosis for eliminationg and starting habits; for example stop smoking, dieting, and good study habits."
3,the dvd version part 1 episodes 1-5,"the material is great (the animation) but their are no subtitles.the voice acting is poor. unlike that of the first two series, which was excellent. I had to turn up the volume on my t.v. almost all the way to hear the dialogue, narration, voice acting. It was fairly mute. The Theme song was in Japanese instead of English. What happened to the classic Star Blazers theme song? the story plot is completely un-original. The sun is destroyed so they have to search for a ""NEW EARTH"". If it was'nt for the fact that the material was great, this should deserve a zero. The voice acting is so horrible that i'll probably have to get the Japanese version from Bandai of Japan.Voyager Entertainment should have given the star Blazers/Yamato T.V. and film series the royal treatment it deserves."
1,Don't waste your money,"The first two Star Blazers series' are disgraced by this addition to the collection. The dreadful voice characterizations, along with the inane dialogue, ruined the already weak plot. It's not just that the voices are different from the original cast...it's that they are BAD voices period! Poorly chosen voices made this almost unwatchable. Not even worth renting!"
5,What's Going On,"The best album of all time, as far as I'm concerned! The man was way ahead of his time and that's what makes this album so special. Right on, Marvin!"
1,SACD in name only,"Very disappointing SACD. Uses none of the technical advantages of SACD. Is simply a re-recording of the 1970s original master with all its typical 70s era flaws. Could have achieved the same goals by re-recording on 8 track tape except they don't exist anymore. Only buy this if you are interested in having a historically accurate recording, not if you are interested in great sound. Recommend buying the cd for $4.71 which interestingly enough claims to be remastered."
3,Clips too short for good music,"The sound clips for listening to samples for this great collection of songs does not do the album justice. The clips are on the avg. of 15 seconds, it would be nice to hear a minute or two, or the whole thing honestly. Just enough of a taste to tantalize the listener but not satisfy them, must be the best way to suck people in to buying CDs etc. without hearing too much. Sad, Amazon lenghten your sound clips !!"
4,MoFi CD Layer,"I don't yet have a SACD player, but I've been buying hybrids since I can enjoy the remastered CD layers now, and be building a SACD collection for that day in the future. With few exceptions, hybrid CD layers are superior to the regular issues, although I've been burned a couple of times when it was obvious that they simply put the old CD version on it instead of using DSD and down-converting to 16 bit PCM.Interestingly, this CD layer is not much of an improvement over the 2002 remaster except that things hold up much better when the mix gets crowded and many instruments kick in and get loud. At this point, the 2002 remaster gets thin while the MFSL version hangs in there. This alone might be enough reason for an audiophile to pick this up."
5,The Finest R&B Album Ever,This is the finest R&B Album ever produced. It's also one the finest rock/pop albums ever produced. An overwhelmingly passionate and deeply personal statement. Richly orchestrated and wonderfully crafted songs support the incredible voice of Gaye.Never has music combined this kind of social commentary with such soulful passion. I go to my grave with this one.
2,DISAPPOINTED LADY,WARNING....I BOUGHT THIS ON MP3 VERY DISSAPPOINTED I'LL TELL YOU WHY...THE END OF THE SONGS ARE CUT OFF...ON SOME OF THE SONGS THEY HAVE A CHORUS ENDING AND ITS NOT THERE..AMAZON IF THERE WAS A MISTAKE LET ME KNOW...YOU CANT FOOL ME I KNOW EVERY PIECE OF THIS ALBUM BEGINNING TO END..DONT BUY THE MP3 ...
3,Not essential,"B sides, rare versions and live tracks. Just to complete your sepultura collection. Outstanding tracks: War, Refuse/resist and Policia."
4,Cure for daily overload,"This book was fun to read and is a great antidote for those days when you are feeling over whelmed. No one's family could be as bad as this one, at least not every day, and yet you can feel the love that underpins it all. The lesson to be learned is to go hide out in the flower cooler, soak in the beauty, take a deep breath and head back into the fray.Jeanne Ray has a unique ability to capture family life in all it's glory. Enjoy."
1,UNBELIEVABLE,The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense. A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't.
2,Boring,"This book is rather boring with no romantic sparks between the leads. I didn't read the first book of this series, so I'm a bit lost as to the history of the characters. However, well written books usually convey enough information so that this is not a problem. In this case, the author comes up short. I'll toss it when I finally finish it."
3,"a beautiful book, but my opinion is that....","It is very difficult to remember perfectly something happened 50 or more year ago. Kriyananda is an artist and he writes like an artist; i.e. he has a natural tendency to embellish stories in a creative way. Obviously I am not affirming that what he wrote in the book is not true, but I think that the contents have been a bit romanticized, maybe even unwillingly. A few alleged comments made by Yogananda on other famous spiritual teachers could have been avoided. It is spiritual gossip; things that maybe should not be written on a book. The book is a very beautiful one, but I have sometimes had the impression that Kriyananda likes more the ""legend"" of Yogananda rather than the man. Worth to be read anyway."
5,"Great acting, great story, great twist","I had to give one of Brittany Murphy's last movies a 5 star rating. However, it really was great for a smaller budget film if you like thriller movies. Brittany's performance reminds us even though we haven't seen her in several years on film she's still got it. No one plays paranoid, scared, and on the edge quite like her (Don't Say A Word.) Some may find the movie a little slow, but I found it totally creepy. The twist at the end is great for any Lost fan who likes shows or movies that make you think a little. Thora Birch recieves an honorable mention as well. I haven't seen her since ""Now & Then"" years ago."
2,crappy,crappy movie. sorry to disappiont. i thought i liked it... but i just cant like it. sorry again if this turns you from seeing it... just trying to save you time
5,Super Snuggly and Fit for a Princess!,"Ordered one for my niece and it is too cute! This is really well made and is a nice big snuggle size. You just slip a standard size pillow into the cover and bam its ready for your little girls bed. At this price, I ordered a couple more for gifts this Christmas!"
3,So-so running shoe.,"It might be that this is just not the best shoe for me -- but its not my favorite shoe. I much prefer New Balance shoes, because this seems rather narrow on my foot. See my post in the dicussion forum here, because I feel like this shoe caused my foot to cramp up pretty badly (I'm not sure if ""cramp"" is the right word, but its the first one that comes to mind).Anyway, I tried to return it to the place I bought it at, and they ""suggested"" trying it out for a few more runs. Today, I went for a short 3-miler, and it seemed okay, but still had the ""pokey"" feeling where I felt some small bump on the inside of the shoe pushing into my foot.I wouldn't kill myself if this was the only shoe I could ever run in again, but I might become a lot less enthusiastic about running..."
5,great!,I use this for my samsung galaxy and it is great! On top of being pretty nice looking it has excellent connection. I was very happy with how comfortable it was since a lot of headsets fit too snugly on my ears. Awesome quality.
5,Sports bra,"Awesome comfort. I wish it cost a little less...but I'd still buy it if it cost more. This is my favorite workout bra ...Yoga, pilates, light jogging; probably not for a serious runner who wants zero bounce."
3,Help dogs,Help dog. I think this is a very good game but if your really crazy about dogs like i am i wood try dogz i got it for my Birthday i liked it for a while but then i got bored of it so i got dogz also dogz 2 i like it alot bettr then any Ds game but that is gost me you can think othr then that.
4,pretty cool,I think nintendogs is cool but I got to a certain point where I had to keep calling my dogs name over and over so I did not get any further in the game so just to worn you there might be a time where you have to callyour dogs name over and over if you buy this game.
4,Nintendogs,Good game...I like the fact that you get to interact with it and actually talk to the dog.
3,this is sorta stuiped,"the graphics are really good but it is so boring I could have cryed (I agree with ""stinks"") it is sorta for 7 year olds and kinda dull (i hope if you are 11 you are not playing this) but maybe you will like it I don't know."
3,Repetitive,"It was an average game, but it got boring after a while. I got one for me and one for my sister's birthday. My sister loved it! For a while anyway. I liked it, then I got bored with it. It got repetitive even though there is 3 types of contests, a whole neighborhood to walk around in, a store, a gym, and a playroom for your dog. The mic is too sensitive and it took 10 minutes to name my dog without it getting confused. The stores never get anything new. The walks seem to drag on and drag on. I seriously DONT recommend this for anyone over 8. Overall, it was a little disapointing.Ciao"
4,its ok,this game is great the first time you play and for a whileafter but if you havent unlocked the dog you want from another version and you are not wanting to adopt another pet its boring and you dont know what to do with the money.you end up with like$5000 but it is still good
4,"If You're Looking For A Good Game, Pick This One","Hello!If you are looking for a game on your Nintendo, pick this one. It is just like owning a real puppy. I got this with the Nintendo. At first, I was clueless and had no help except the manual, which didn't give enough info. But this game is easy to grasp after 1-2 days, so don't worry. You basically own a dog and can feed it, train it, take care of it, and more. It doesn't matter which kind you get,(Chihuahua and Friends, Dachshund and Friends, and Labrador and Friends) because if you're a good trainer you can just unlock all the breeds.This game had great graphics and sound affects, so buy buy BUY it!!!"
2,"Oh, and i forgot...","If you like this, be SURE to check out Meshuggah, particularly the album Destroy Erase, Improve. Same sort of style with better vocals, tricky polyrhythms (which make it more interesting) and a better guitar sound. Those guys have the Machine-sound down pat. I guarantee you will like them better than Fear Factory unless the rhythm's are too complex and it goes over you're head. But that won't happen, right? :)"
5,"This Fear Factory ""Demanufacture"" CD will not disappoint","I bought this CD because, shockingly, I noticed I didn't have it in my Fear Factory CD collection. Once it arrived, the songs are great back-to-back. In my opinion, this is their best CD yet. My Fear Factory collection is now complete."
5,they kick ass,this is one of the only bands that i know of that incorporates harmonics and screaming intense vocals into one song. they go from hard thrashing speed metal and industrial to slow and soothing guitars and other sounds.. definitely worth buying.
3,"Why not use ""beats""?","This book has a lot of useful information, but some of it I had to question, especially Mr. Flinn's advice about not using ""beats"". Take a look at the screenplay for The Sixth Sense... it has abundant use of the dreaded ""beat"" word. And this was probably one of the most sought after (and best written) screenplay's to hit Hollywood in the last few years. I'd be curious to hear if Mr. Flinn would care to modify his advice about ""beats""."
1,Charged thirty bucks more on credit card than advertised price.,I paid 53$ and was charged 85$. No possible way I can find to let anyone know except to return and get a refund. Then find someone honest enough to sell something that goes for the advertised price. This purchse was a robbery. I'd send it back but it was a gift.
2,Lacks power,"When I first got turned on to Life of Agony, It was during the grunge era, when heavy music was almost wiped off the face of the earth. I was hungry for powerful metal. Along came River Runs Red. This was a very powerful album with crushing rhythms, powerful vocals, and the thrash standard unison shouting. My anticpation grew until finally Ugly was realeased. I bought Ugly the day it came out and sampled it with my friend who also loved River Runs Red. Dissapointment. Ugly just did not have any power. It is not a bad album, but it didn't have the energy or songs like Through and Through or River Runs Red. I only listended to the album twice, and it sat on my shelf for two years before I traded it in. I will always keep River Runs Red"
4,A Gentle Story of a Vanished Time,"It's easy to forget just how much the world changed in the 20th century. Sturt's A Farmer's Life captures a world in the midst of change. Ending just before the hurlyburly of World War I, Sturt's gentle reminiscent of his uncle, James Smith, depict a gentle, though extensively detailed, reminiscence of a now extinct rural agrarian life. It's not challenging, and it won't change your life, but it provided me with an escape from my fast paced work life every evening as I read it in 15 minutes intervals in the night before sleep."
5,Charming romantic comedy.,"After watching this, I ordered three more of Casper Andreas's films. After watching one of them, I went ahead and bought the remaining two. I've now watched all of them. In an interview included as a bonus feature on one of the dvds, Andreas is asked what advice he would give aspiring filmmakers, and he says something like ""Do it! The technology is so cheap now, anybody can make a movie!"" He neglects to mention that equipment by itself isn't enough. He's got gifts. I wish he would get busy. I'm waiting impatiently for his next six films."
5,Most Amazing movie!!,I am really enjoying GOING DOWN IN LA-LA LAND movie very much. Excellent!! First Class!! Most amazing movie I have ever been!!
4,Liked it a lot.,Liked this film a lot. The cast is fine and easy to look at. Will check out director's other films.
2,Going Down,Did not like this video. It was very improbable and unrealistic. Definitely not what I expected and was not what I was looking for
3,Trailer Park Boys,"This dvd contains lots of cuss words so if you have kids not for the kids this is strictly adult entertainment. This dvd was made before the Trailer Park Boys was on TV to see how people would respond to the TV show. If you like the Trailer Park Boys it would probably be a good dvd to buy. I liked the TV show but I'm but not too interested in this dvd after I bought it and seen it. But some one else who is a big fan of the Trailer Park Boys may like and enjoy watching this dvd and learning about the characters and what the show is pretty much going to be about. This dvd has the characters talking about the show in this dvd. If I had to the chance to buy it again I probably wouldn't but that is my opinion. I would check it out before I spent any money to buy it or you can buy it, look at it and if you didn't like it sell it. Thank you Sandy McClaflin"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR COLLECTION,"This episode is so good and explains so much and so little at the same time... No Ricky, God and Santa aren't the same person! If you like the Trailer Park Boys you MUST watch this episode. This was the perfect Christmas gift as we got to watch it Christmas morning. Oh, my shipping was fast, earlier than expected and the condition was new and perfect."
5,Compelling reading,"Much of ""In Bad Company"" centers on possible links between Tim McVeigh and the Aryan Republican Army -- and examines a multiple John Doe No. 2 theory that will keep you awake nights.All in all, a well-written, fast-paced -- and extremely disturbing book."
3,Required jeweler assistance.,My son-in-law was very pleased to receive this watch as a gift. However none of the adults present could rotate the outer rim as the directions instructed to get it to pop up and then proceed with the setting process. The band is quite large and has to have at least 4 links removed so hopefully a jeweler can assist with the initial set up of the watch. I was a little disappointed that it was so complicated to set but since the band was so large it couldn't be worn immediately.
5,good,Awesome recieved said item in a timely fashion and it was exactly what i had ordered.. Abnsolutely say if you want this item order it..
4,Metal meets the third world,"ROOTS is just a killer album. The riffs are awesome the songs are heavy and powerful. SEPULTURA has matured as a band and on this album, they arent afraid to experiment with new sounds. ROOTS BLOODY ROOTS, ENDANGERED SPECIES, ATTITUDE, CUT THOAT, SPIT, STRAIGHT HATE are heavy songs that the listener will enjoy and I think really stand out here. RATAMAHATTA is a great song that the band uses third world sounds and Portugeuese lyrics mixed with thier own heavy music that they pull off quite well. The two instrumentals JASCO with only Andreas playing an accoustic guitar and ITSARI which is in the same style as RATAMAHATTA with an indiginous chant are also killer. This was the last album to have MAX CAVALERA as the singer, and with this album he went out with a ban. The only song I didnt care for was LOOKAWAY. I would rate this more as a 4 1/2 stars"
3,Lets get things straight. SEPULTURA IS NOT DEATH METAL .,"This album is one of my least favorite and I'm a fan. This album is more nu-metal than thrash metal in the direction of I hate to say it KORN. I was greatly disapointed that they changed in sound and is the final record with Max Cavalera who I might add a great vocalist and songwriter, But their are some highlights like ROOTS BLOODY ROOTS heavy catchy powerhouse of a song, as well as ATTITUDE another in your face and like it type of song.....well lets face it the only great songs is in the first half of the cd. The rest is disapointing. Oh yeah dictators**t cool too."
3,LAST CD WITH MAX CAVALERA,"""Roots"" marked the beginning of Sepultura experiencing with new sounds, and it is the last cd with guitarrist / singer Cavalera. After that, the band was never the same."
5,go seplatura go!!! hell yeah!,"do yourself and get this albums. you will not be disapointed and remind those static x panzees who the fu*k they stole from!!! oh and check out living sacrafice, reborn empowered."
5,Heavy Duty Blade,"These blades are heavy duty, better than the ones that came on my lawnmower. I would purchase again. I am well satisfied."
3,"Helpful, but Overly Structured","I have gone through several of the parts of this book, however I've found that the instructions are sometimes way too structured for me to really delve into my personal feelings. Also, many of the poems and experiences shared in the book, which the reader is also supposed to write about, are not experiences that I could share or relate to and that made it difficult if not impossible to compose some kind of poem on the subject using her instructions."
5,BETTER THAN MATANDO GUERROS.,"This is brujeria's second and best album.I have heard all of brujeria's work and I can honestly say that I liked this one the best.All the songs are faster and heavier than the ones on matando guerros.Not to mention that the sound production on this album is alot better than matando guerros.Enough said,go out and get this today if you dont already have it.BRUJERIA RULES!!!"
2,Mildly entertaining at best,"I don't honestly get the appeal of this movie. I'd heard a lot of good buzz about it while it was in the theaters, but in truth, I watched about 20 minutes of it and gave up throwing good minutes-of-my-life after bad.Part of it is that Katherine Heigl's recent interviews on this movie and on Grey's Anatomy have left me with little respect for her, making it kind of hard to listen to her shrillness.The general plot of the movie isn't believable (since when does a successful woman decide to date the high school drop out, even if she does get pregnant by him?) and believability is forgivable if the comedic potential is realized, but here it is not, which simply leaves me feeling like it's trying to be absurd but somehow failing."
4,A basically sweet movie saturated with crudity,"I rented this because I'd heard it was hilarious. It isn't, but it's still a very enjoyable movie, although perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be. As the title indicates, Knocked Up is about an aspiring young woman, Alison, who gets pregnant accidentally. This happens during a one-night stand with Ben, a basically decent but doofy and unambitious man who is still living a frat-boy lifestyle with his slacker friends. The movie traces how relationships develop, focusing mainly on Ben and Alison, but also touching on developments in the lives of others, including Alison's sister and her husband.There's an awful lot of crudity throughout the movie, including both rough language and sexually explicit scenes. However, if you look (and listen) past the crudeness, this is basically a sweet and good-hearted movie about growing up, facing life, and doing the right thing. A good ""date movie"" if you and your date don't mind bad language and gross-out behavior."
1,Just Plain Crude,"Maybe I'm just old - and I certainly don't consider myself a prude - but I cannot believe the vulgarity in the dialogue in this movie, especially in mixed company. All us guys talk ""locker room"" when by ourselves...but crude references to oral (and other kinds) of sex in front of women? If this is really the way younger people talk nowadays, our society is headed for extinction. I watched this movie strictly because of Katherine Heigl whom I think is adorable and whose looks remind me of the pretty girls from the 50's and 60's. It was disappointing to hear her use such vulgarity. I know she's a professional actress and it's her job to read the script. Hopefully she will get much better films than this to work in as she's very appealing on screen and a decent actress. The story itself is good, but hardly believeable. Nowadays, few women that attractive would hook up with such a geeky-looking guy like that for one night, much less fall in love with him and bear his child."
2,"Don't Be A Sucker... This isn't ""Unrated"" it's OVERRATED.","Similar to the appropriately titled ""Superbad"", this is another inconsistent Canadian Porky-like comedy that lacks direction. And if you think that ""Unrated"" means Catherine Heigel gets naked in this forget it. She doesn't."
2,So-So,"Had great anticipation for a funny movie. Instead found it to be very unrealistic. Don't believe two people, so mismatched could succeed in a relationship, let alone parenting. Even stretching my imagination, which is quite good, and allowing for poetic license I couldn't accept the situation with these people and I guess missed the humor, other than very basic and predictable situations. Was a big let down."
4,a good laugh,"This movie is truly hilarious. If you liked the 40 year old virgin then you will like this one, too. His roommates are so goofy and the extras disc showcases a lot of their shenanigans. If you want a laugh until your sides hurt then pop this one in."
5,great movie,it was so possible and it is great that he ended up being a nice guy to stick around. i love that they made it so realistic besides her hiding it from work until like her last month.. that is totally not.. but yah it was fantastic.. buy it now!
1,awful,I rented this poor excuse of a movie based on critics' rave reviews. It seemed like a movie written by teenage boys for teenage boys. There were also times it was obvious that the actors were making it up as they went along (ex. car scene w/Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl). Paul Rudd was the ONLY bright (and funny) spot in this god-awful movie.
1,Such A Disappointment...,"Such A Disappointment...Ok...so the storyline is cute, in theory, and of course I am a fan of Katherine Heigl. I would have to say that this movie was beneath her talent and was a waste of time. It was crass and had random nudity which really had nothing to do with the storyline. I suppose it is more along the lines of a movie made for a high school boy. I really had high hopes that it would have a bit more substance. I was very disappointed..."
1,"Unrated, but rated.","The number of dvd titles with a huge ""unrated"" printed on them keeps increasing in number rapidly for the last few years.Even films wich has nothing got to do with unrated stuff - you know what- comes with an unrated tag.Now they have started to lie out right.I know this is a marketing trick and i know it may be a joke thing for this particular title but it makes me sick that the marketing people is actually thinking that they are cheating the customers this way.I dont know about US, but this is illegal to do in many european countries, so Amazon please dont let studios trick your customers with these cheap tricks.Ah, about the movie, its knocked up. 1 star. Even no stars."
2,Kinda funny,This movie was ok - I laughed out loud a few times but there was just too much in the gutter
5,Just get it...don't read the review!!!!!,"I hate reviews man! Everything about them. You can't trust them because people who do reviews are not Y-O-U!!!!! Get It?????!!!!!So I'm just telling you from my expierence as a person that loves to laugh and really isn't into the documentry stuff and bloopers.I had a great time watching the second disc! A friggin' great time!!!!! It was as good as the movie itself.So I say unto you...the only way you are going to find this out is to get one of these and sit back, relax, and let it all, I mean ALL hang out baby!!!!!Enjoy!"
1,Way overrated - not funny,"Finally watched this after all the hype. It was not funny and only marginally interesting. The 2nd half was a little better than the first. The fact that Alison, who is hot, successful and interesting would even acknowledge a boring slob like Ben made the whole framework of the film fall apart. Add to the fact that Ben was not the least bit funny made it worse. Usually in these cookie-cutter films, the sidekicks steal the show. Not in this case. What a bad combo, a boring/bad fit leading man whose buddies were NOT even 1% funny! Ugh! What a waste of time.To put things in perspective - I thought 40 Year Old Virgins and Wedding Crashers were hysterical!"
3,Very Few Laughs,"After having this movie compared to the 40-year Old Virgin, I was expecting a lot more comedy out of this movie. It had very few laughs and the drama wasn't good enough to warrent more than three stars.Some of the scenes were a little graphic when the baby was born. The father was a real loser and you wonder why the mother wants to give him a chance (he was living off an inheritance that had run out and had no ambition towards a job). Also, his friends were quite annoying.The only saving grace of the movie was the woman's sister and her own family struggles."
1,A BIG LET DOWN,NOT MUCH 2 SAY THE BEST PARTS OF THE ENTIRE FILM ARE THE BEARDED GUY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND THERE ACTING IS BETTER THEN THE ENTIRE MOVIE DONT BUY IT RENT IT FOR A BUCK AT YOUR NEAREST RED BOX OUTSIDE MCDONALDS ALTHOUGHT YOUL BE DISAPOINTED THAT U SPENT THAT MUCH MONY ON GAS ON SUCH A WAST OF TIME!
3,No nude scenes of Heigl,There are no nude scenes of Katherine Heigl. (She keeps her brassiere on when she has sex.) The only scene featuring nudity in which Heigl is present is a scene showing us Seth Rogen's nude butt.
3,Unlikely and too long,"I saw the unrated version, which goes on way too long with extended scenes that don't need extending, the most shocking of which shows a couple of closeups of the actual birth. These two are a mismatch, but I guess that's the whole point. Still, it's hard to see why they don't get an abortion and never see each other again. The supporting cast is amusing, especially the four dudes who all live together in mutual grossness. I didn't laugh once, but that's not rare for a Hollywood comedy. Do yourself a favor, and see the shortest version of this you can find."
1,A BAD BAD THING,"THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG,LONG TIME. THE PREMISE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BOTH REALLY DRUNK AND HAD SEX. IT IS CLEAR THEY COULD NOT GET THE BARTENDER TO WAIT ON THEM. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THEY HAD MORE THAN ONE DRINK.THERE ARE A LOT OF DISGUSTING UGLY DUMB GUYS INCLUDING THE ""STAR."" IT IS HARD TO MAKE A ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH KATHERINE HEIGL, BUT THEY HAVE MANAGED. THIS MOVIE IS A BAD, BAD THING. WHAT WERE THE OTHER REVIEWERS THINKING OF?"
3,Not as funny as I thought,I love Paul Rudd and he managed to do ok in this.I think I felt bad for the character more than anything while watching this movie. and it was slightly disturbing. i would never own this movie. it was good for a once through.
1,"Booooring, not funny!","I watched half of this movie at a friend's house the other night and we couldn't even finish it. It was boring, lame, and just not funny. The whole time I was just wishing the girl would either have an abortion or give the baby up for adoption. This movie gave me the creeps. What a nightmare! NOT FUNNY!"
3,movie ok - streaming HD frustrating at times,"The movie was mildly entertaining. We watched it because the new movie that's about to come out as the squeal looked really good and we thought we should see the first movie before going to the theater for the new one, but we were a bit disappointed. It wasn't bad, just not as good as we hoped.As for the choice between HD streaming for a dollar more...I wouldn't choose it again. A Friday evening must be a busy time for our cable internet service because there were several times the movie cut out on us completely and had to be restarted and other time is was pix-elated and choppy. In all fairness Amazon does display a caution when purchasing HD streaming, but we went for it anyway. It was not a good choice...."
1,Trash,The film was trash. It's only redeeming quality was that they allowed the child to be born instead of killing it like so many people do anymore.
5,Superb stories enchantingly told...,"This CD book was purchased to break the monotony of the rotation of children's music we listen to in the car... My six-year-old daughter, my husband and I love the stories, Steven Fry's voices and the gentle, curious, innocent, very-very funny stories about Paddington in every chapter of this book.We've already listened to the 2-CD book over and again to the point that I thought I'd see if there was more! (for some reason I didn't find more than this book at the the original time of purchase)I have yet to receive, but have recently purchased (from Amazon) two other Paddington CD-books to add to the listening fun that Paddington has brought to our drive time...HIGHLY recommend :)"
5,PADDINGTON FIRST STORYBOOK,"I bought this as a gift for a new nephew. I'm certain he'll be amused by the stories, and I was happy to get an anniversary edition. I hope he'll cherish and keep it for many years to come."
3,More like two and a half,"It's ok, and only ok. The music is weak and too much like korn in some areas. The lyrics [disappoint], but the music is okay. They kinda rock out with the guitar on some songs. Id prefer this one over any of there other cds"
4,"Not as good as C. music, but still awesome","I bought Chamber Music before i got this, so i was expecting a more melodic metal sound. But this one was more heavy. The first song i played was ""Sway"" because of the lyrics. But the guitar is great and so is the bass. Other songs include Big truck, I, and clock. Those songs are pretty cool and blew me away. But none of that compares to No Home, or Tradgedy of Chamber Music. Still, this album is great, and Coal Chamber is just getting better and better....."
2,Coal Chamber - just another bunch of goths,"An album from four multi pierced, multi tattooed, multi hair coloured goths. The vocalist sometimes howls agonisingly about a 'big truck', and sometimes creates a good song like 'Bradley'. The riffs on this album are too slow and not catchy enough. I think Coal Chamber are just trying to catch the attention of gothic fans who have got sick of Marilyn Manson. One song stands out from the rest and that is 'Sway'. I think that for people with no previous gothic music experience they should stay away from this album. Pretty average, with a few good songs and a few memeorable moments."
2,No big deal,"This band needs to get a little more creative. The CD is okay, it has heavy riffs and vocals, but they sound too much like Korn. All the songs seem to run together because they're all built on the same guitar riff. And in the song ""sway"" he says: ""The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire..."" I swear I heard those same exact lyrics on a song by Bloodhound Gang. Just be careful and listen to it before you buy it."
3,A Solid Lump of Coal,"I had this album for a while, then sold it. Coal Chamber is solid, decent, mosh-ready music, however unoriginal. This is that album that you should either dub, buy the cassette, or swipe from someone who could care less. My personal favorite would have to be the too-short ""Pig"". There are many terrible wastes, and if you listen, you'll hear them right off. Give them a chance, I suppose. They're just plain all right."
2,Repetitive as Hiawatha!,"I wanted to like this album, just look how sweet Rayna is. As cute as the girl from White Zombie. The music was hard, angry, fast, Loco, ""Don't F*** with me! Me Loco!"" Almost like Korn, ""C'mon, F*** with me!"" from Reclaim my Place. All the songs sound almost exactly the same with only a few minor timing differences, except for Amir of the Desert which did culminate a curious grin. Coal Chamber has taken elements from more recognized bands from this genre and spliced them together into this potpourri of seeming madness. I cannot blame them though, I bought the record after buying into all of the hype my friends had cast upon it. Now it sits at the very bottom of my CD collection, never played while real metal bands like Sepultura are listened to on a daily basis. The only saving grace was the recorded outtake that was on after the very last song finished, where Dez, or Bradley I guess, was offering ""Two pigs for a camel"" and the band had an imprompteu jam session."
3,COAL CHAMBER DEBUT!!!!,"I really like this debut from COAL CHAMBER!!! Besides the fact that the songs here sound exactly like KORN, with the vocals being a mix of Jonathan Davis and Rob Zombie, it's a good heavy metal album!!! BRADLEY, ODDITY, LOCO and SWAY are great!!!!"
5,My privilege,"I had the great privilege of seeing Fulton Sheen's television show the first time around. I was just a child, but the man with the twinkling eyes and beetle brows spoke to me as well as to my parents. His warmth, kindness, holiness and humor absolutely radiated. We are fortunate that the author and editor of this book took the time to save these wonderful and holy thoughts of a wonderful and holy man."
5,Excellent lens value,"I wanted an inexpensive macro lens and bought this based on reviews.On the whole this is a great lens. In several tests I found this lens sharper than even the highly rated Nikon 50 F1.8 prime lens (which, while faster and cheaper is not a macro lens). Color rendition and bokeh are acceptable.I eventually sold my Nikon prime and use this as my day to day prime lens.In terms of negatives -Auto focus is a little noisier than most lensesBulkier than comparable prime lenses (not a fair criticism since this has macro capabilities) The lens build Build is not the greatest, but it is great value for the money.Highly recommend unless you absolutely need wider apertures than F/2.8"
1,What the Hell is this?,"I have been waiting a long time for this. After hearing the highly anticipated new Mayhem, I wanted to puke. This is a extreme waste of talent. On occasion musical briliance can be heard, but it is no match for the super cheesy vocals and over all weirdness. There is even one track that sounds like a dance club song. I can't believe this, I could not even give this away to my friends."
5,one of the best of its year,"simply, this was one of the best of the crop (02 or 03, which it is escapes me). His voice is infectious; el=p reigns it in for the massappeal flow of lif, and, no disrespect, for the nods, sometimes his snares are little slow if you aren't super faded, but, regardless, this is the joint-all tracks (except maybe that aesop one)-beats and lyrics-supreme."
3,3 out of 11 ain't too shabby isn't it?,"Floodgate's oeuvre contains three ass-kicking grunge-grind-groove tracks that are really worth listening to:-Those days is definetly the best, with an upbeat tempo and good percussions along with darn good vocals-Black with Sin comes second with a groovy opening section that won't let you down-Last but not least we have before the line divides an overall good trackAll in all I wish all the best for this band, the potential is undeniably huge (I think Floodgate sounds much better than the over-hyped Creed)."
4,A Book for the Writer,"A cleaver mix of two stories: the novel that Ursula is writing and the interruptions as she writes. She is distracted by family (husband and two children) as well as the characters of the novel. These interruptions show the proces of writing as the characters question and argue with the writer.There is a story told---Megan, the young mother is bored and/or overwhelmed by her life. She walks away from it for a rest, a re-examination. There is no great conclusion reached though. It is the intrusions that carry the story. The intrusions are life, because life does not proceed along a well-defined track. Things always obstruct the track. And Megan learns that no matter how well she plans ahead and imagines outcomes, intrusions will alwaus change and direct the outcome."
1,This product is hazardous to my health,"I recently bought a new Mighty Mite Vacuum Cleaner and 30 bags for it.I have some severe allergies, so the product sounded perfect for my needs. Unfortunately I was both surprised and alarmed when I took out a bag tried to put it into the machine. There is a rubber flange at the opening which appears to be made of latex rubber. Latex rubber is the one product I am most allergic to and have in the past suffered Anaphylactic Shock and near death due to exposure to it. So I cannot touch the bags. This is a real problem when it comes to changing bags in the vacuum cleaner. I have to get someone else to do it. My big complaint is due to the use of a substance to which many people have a serious allergy in the product, and the failure to disclose that information in their product description. It could result in serious injury, or even death to the unsuspecting customer and result in lawsuits."
2,The book is not meant for 2nd grade,It's too much of a college textbook reading. There are very few examples of real lessons. I wish it were more practical to use.
2,Muzak for the eyes,"Not informative and will add nothing to your knowledge or appreciation of Japanese Gardens. OK to read by, I guess."
1,This book made me cry,"This book made me cry.It made me cry for any person confronting the issue of homosexuality.This book made me cry for any person who knows a homosexuality.I know this issue, better than most. And it makes me cry that people will read this book seeking advice, and all they will find is... unhelpful."
2,There's more than the US,"This book is fine for people looking to get into a US school. If you are also considering a European or Asian school, spend your money on the Economist (EIU) review."
2,I Dunno,"I love both the original LPs that are on this cd. What I don't like is when the remastering alters the orginal sound so much that it completely changes the performance. On both ""Promised Land"" and ""Loving Arms"" the background voices are all but edited out. While I realize that some listeners like it this way, I would prefer if the intergrity of the original were preserved. The added harmony vocal on the second verse of Promised Land was great, but without it the performance seems bland compared to the original 45 and LP. This has been a hallmark of some of the reissues of Elvis material in recent years, I wish they'd cut it out and just punch up the original mix."
5,Great for discoloration,"Love this product. Amazon is the only place that ships it for a good price, great for dark skinned females. I have been using this product for years and I have little dis coloration on my face."
4,Eternal Life,"Dream Brother is an ambitious book that does a good job analyzing and linking the lives of Jeff and Tim Buckley. I am an obsessive fan of Jeff Buckley, and I love knowing what inspired his songs. I loved the journal entries at the beginning of each chapter...but I wish there were more. I never knew how Jeff grew up, and it makes him life even more tragic. I wish his friends had helped him, and the book wasnt clear about why they didnt. Thank you David Browne for explaining jeff to me."
5,Excellent product great price,"I bought this cord over 2 year ago. It held up very well, exposed to the weather mostly SoCal sun.The price was about 45% of the price at local stores."
3,"Satisfactory.. Good smell to you, not the pets","Our vet recommended the Max Oral Gel (also purchased) My pets tolerate that alot more than this. The Max has to be refrigerated, this does not. I guess the two can work coincide."
1,Dissapointed,I was disappointed with my purchase because the battery charger did not work. I am a new customer and was very hesitant to purchase anything through amazon and this did not help.
4,Nikon MH-61 battery charger,The first charger they sent was defective. They replaced it with a new charger within one week and this one is working just fine.
4,"This would be the best, but....","Yes folks, this would qualify as their best album ever. It has everything, right? Insane vocals, Doug and Terrence shreding like mad, super fast drums. Hmmm. Sounds great. But what about that last album they did. You know, the one that you can't find. The one with Dave Culross on it. I KNOW WHERE TO GET IT! Go to vultureent.com. They have it. You must get it. It is only five songs. SO WHAT! It is fantastic. Go there now and get it. You won't be sorry."
5,A classic death metal album by suffocation,"Suffocation is a great band...it's really sad that we can't see them anymore...This album is great, and definatly the best album by suffocation. The vocals are deep and evil, and the guitar/bass riffs sounds great. The lyrics are good, and they seem to concern a lot about what's going around with this world...Anyways, BUY THIS ALBUM...YOU WON'T REGRET IT"
5,Liberation of Heavy Torments from the pits of underworlds.,"Marble has a pattern of equanimity, and interaction of place and reality applied to what is heard here, when the bass player takes an emphasis of identity and fits with the interlaced work on two guitars and their overwhelming heavily tech-minded approach, all controlled with a drum set present to keep cohesiveness on the sound allowing the guttural voices to rip apart thru a series of levels.""Pierced from Within"" is a composition set to remain uncompromising and morphes into a montrous being of destruction with a limitless power, the uncertainty of percerption is its source and it will always exist."
5,"Astounding Book, Read it again and again!","I loved LaRisa's spunk and courage. Spence was a wonderful hero, the perfect mate for the heroine. LaRisa faced prejudice for being Apache, but her kind heart finally won her the respect of those who first looked down upon her.If you find this book, let me tell you that it is a keeper. You will love reading it again and again!"
2,Worked but weak weld,"The hose worked as planned, but after a year of use after being left in our motorhome through the winter, corrosion must have weakened the nut weld and is just split. This happened while we were 150 miles away from anywhere, leaving us without our stove. I would recommend taking it off the appliance after use and keeping it away from corrosion. The copper nut should have been stronger then it appears."
4,Good Movie,I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie - it was worth the two hours of my time. Lots of funny twists (although somewhat expected) that kept the movie entertaining.
3,"Not Terrible, but Not Great either","Big Nothing was a bit of a disappointment considering the presence of David Schwimmer (!) and Mimi Rogers, though by no means is it a terrible movie.A former school teacher in an effort to help support his family financially teams up with a con artist and his ex-girlfriend in blackmailing a reverend with a soft spot for illegal on-line adult entertainment.The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.In short, the acting is good, the plot is just average, while the humor is decent.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.No masterpiece here... 2.5 Stars"
5,great movie,This is a great movie. The english Subtitles are excellent but nothing is better then understanding the original language this was filmed in. Great action sequences with matching music make this movie great to watch.
2,Not durable - stick with the round style fenders.,These looked like a great idea. Turns out they're not. The eye you run the rope thru tore out on my first use. I'm going to go back to the old style round fenders. When you bump against the dock with the round fenders they roll. This one just pulls on the rope until it tears.
1,You get what you pay for,"Well, I bought this cable and ran it through a wall. after hooking it up to my AV Receiver, the cable bent slightly and the whole connector broke apart into a unrepairable mess. The connector is quite cheap and will break apart."
2,Poor signal,"Bought to connect my PC to my tv in another room. Very poor signal, have to reduce my refresh rate to 59 and disable hdmi audio in 1080p to keep it from flickering every few seconds and even then black areas get this flickering green static sometimes. It's tolerable for the price but I'm definitely looking for a different one to do the job so I would not recommend it."
4,"Very listenable, roots album","This is a real good debut album from this trio. The songs are well written, many have a Neal Youngish kind of feel. The blending of the harmonies of the female bass player and male singer-guitarist really gives the sound an 'edge' missing from alot of roots type bands. Standout cuts include a haunting ballad about Elvis, ""epitaph"", and the anthem ""A Band Named Bud"" -with the hilarious lyrics--'It was a band named Bud -- That made Electric Mud'. I also loved the great radio tribute ""ZZQ"". This band could develop into quite a force as they mature and if the quality of the songs remains strong."
3,Not enough Jack until the end,An interesting plodding story.Jack Reacher was very tame. A rather boring proceduaral story. It appeared to be and early Reacher story. I was disapointed
2,TOO VIOLENT,"THE HIT-MEN WERE MUCH TO VIOLENT FOR ME. GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE. I LIKE MYSTERIES THAT REQUIRE SOLVING WITHOUT ANY MORE VIOLENCE THAN NECESSARY. OF COURSE, I KNOW THAT THERE OFTEN (BUT NOT ALWAYS) HAS TO BE A MURDER OR TWO, BUT ONLY TO SET THE STAGE FOR SOLVING."
5,Tripwire,"Lee Child never ceases to amaze me with his ability to go into great detail in developing his characters and their personalities and abilities, and then bring everything together at the end, and tie up all loose ends!"
5,Lee Child book,"Lee Child's Book, TRIPWIRE, arrived as promised. It was packed well and received on time. I enjoyed readihng it. Thank you so much."
3,"Good, but his first 2 books were MUCH better!","I am a huge Jack Reacher fan. None the less, in my opinion, we may be losing Lee Child to the world of fame and the pressure of a release date. Like most musicians and actors, once they are ""dicovered"" it seems they lose the drive that poverty gives them to be GREAT, and they just begin to produce. Well, Mr. Child if you read this, please know that I am a dedicated reader until given reason not to do so. I await your next release in eager anticipation of the raw talent that I came to enjoy in THE KILLING FLOOR. Stay pure and true to your talent, and I personally will keep food on your table. Until then I command all who are considering TRIPWIRE, read THE KILLING FLOOR first."
3,Fantasy for the middle aged executive,"I had avoided Lee Child before because I'd figured that his novels would be of the ultra-macho ""Bravo Two Zero"" school. The Anthony (I think) Award made me decide to give him a try (coupled with the money back offer here in his UK homeland). This is an airport novel designed for the folks in the cheap seats to fantasise about first class travel. It's also for the guy with a paunch who wishes he could stand up to his boss - preferably with some killer martial arts technique. He also dreams of protecting a gorgeous blonde from the bullets that fly off his manly chest. The bad guy reminds me of the problem I had with Mason Verger in ""Hannibal"", he seems like Mr Burns with a claw. The surprise about his character change isn't much of a shock. Plus points it's a quick and easy read but if you prefer crime to all-out action then think twice."
4,"tripwire, Jack Reacher.",i like this type of book. it's a page turner and i really enjoy the character that Child creates. i try to read all the Jack reacher books and look forward to the movie.
3,Three and Out,"""Tripwire"" is my third and likely last 'Reacher' episode for me. It's the formula . . . over and over . . . vagabond superman, trouble finds him, throw in a stunning babe, a sadist criminal with cohorts, work outside the law, big shoot 'em up totally unbelievable climax . . . and that's Jack Reacher. For me, escapist reading is fun, but enough is enough. Gotta try something new."
2,Childish fiction,"I bought this book in the series after watching Cruise's take on the character in ""Jack Reacher."" Cruise made the character believable whereas the author fails miserably. A MP major, this clueless? A West Point grad? Get real! So much gruesome violence. The movie, however, has interesting aspects. Cruise defends and makes reasonable Reacher's withdrawal from the mainstream.As a shooting competitor, I also found the movie interesting for its 308 shooting/reloading. The author on the other hand made several firearms technical errors. The book: Jejune. Puerile."
4,Another awesome Jack Reacher novel....,"Like the first 2, this one was really really good. Fast moving, mostly believable and just a fun exciting read."
1,3 bad plots don't make a good one,"I really hate it when authors take multiple mediocre plots and braid them together with feeble constructions or coincidences and call it a book. That's what we have here - a 400 page book that's really 3 x 133 page books braided together, none of them could stand alone. I said it about the earlier book Die Trying - the author needs to learn about ballistics. Luckily I didn't buy these - I picked them up in a local free exchange - hope I didn't drag home any more."
2,Jerks the reader around,"I picked this book up at a modest discount at a Borders Clearance sale. It kept me reading but really, it's not significantly better than quite a few of the 99-cent potboilers you can get on the Kindle. Food for thought, that.I expected better of a namebrand author like Lee Childs. The characters, including Reacher, are smart when the plot needs them to be and stupid when that's required, which is fairly often. Information gets withheld often--at one point, Reacher asks another character to repeat some key information, on-camera, three times, and never tells it to the reader. The various character breakdowns and suspensions of disbelief don't really add up to setting the book aside until near the very end and by then why not finish it?It was an okay poolside read, but if I'm looking for thrillers, I'll try Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly and David Morrell, whose craftsmanship is almost always impeccable."
2,Reaccher fan,"Good book, but I,m still looking for that feeling I got from reading my first Reached novel ""killing floor"" this is the third one I read and still have not been quite as impressed."
5,You gotta love Reacher,"I picked up my first ""Reacher Novel"" in an airport newsstand in Minnesota based on the recommendation of a guy standing behind me. Pretty long flight back to Jersey, I took his advice. Since reading that first one, I have now gone back and started to read them all from the beginning. I'm now on #4."
4,No3 is better than No 2.,"Suspensefull, scary at times, evil guy is EVIL. Read it all the way through, no real twists, no surprises, and not enough connection to the other books for me.the third book in a series should have some backstory that carries on from the other 2. You could easily read them 3 then 2 then 1 and it would make no difference. when you put time in a character you want him to grow, Reacher has not learned anything in 3 books, not planning to read 4 unless I am totally board one day."
5,A Reacher series,A great book written by Lee Chld who has a main charcter by the name of Reacher. The book keeps you turning the pages and you can't wait to read what happens next.
5,review,"easy read without having to think too much about anything. 10 more words required to submit, what an idiotic rule."
1,This is the last one I read from Child,"Long and boring just like most of his novels. Once again he ran out of ideas before he ran out of ink. Also, thanks for stereotyping Texans again you arrogant, ignorant Brit. Child knows nothing about the military or Texans but that doesn't stop him from writing about either. I can sum up by suggesting there are much better authors out there folks.(I guess I did make the same mistake again afterall. I guess hope springs eternal.)"
1,TERRIBLE ARCH,"I bought this for my 2 month old and we put it up and the arch would not stay up, so I took it back the very next day and spent the extra money and got a better one! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
3,Better for less active babies,"We bought this for my daughter when she was a month old and she loved it. She would lay under it happily for long periods of time. She loved to see herself in the mirror. When she was learned to roll over from her back to tummy she would grab ahold of the sides of the arch and use it to pull her self over. Now that she is 4 months old, she still likes it, but is awful rough on it, and pulls on the toys and the whole things falls on her, but she thinks it is funny. It still keeps her entertained, but I can tell that she will either destroy it or get bored with it soon."
3,Not up to LMM standards,"This one didn't live up to the memory I had of reading it as a tween. It was an early book of L.M.M.'s; boy takes over teaching position for sick friend, boy hears beautiful violin playing from an orchard, boy falls rump over teakettle in love with violinist, and is dismayed to find she is a fiercely protected mute girl who has hardly been out of her house since she was small. From then on it is a pitched battle as the hero seeks a way to make Kilmeny whole, and to make her his. In this one the ... I don't want to say racism; perhaps ethnocentricity is a kinder word, or xenophobia... comes out more strongly than in most. It's a slender book, sweet (as always), and wrapped up a little too neatly (as always) - and without the depth of charm that carries off any faults in the other books."
5,The wonder of Zhang Ziyi --,"Probably Wong Kar Wai's best film, slightly ahead of ""Chunking Express"".Zhang Ziyi's performance as Bai Ling is beyond her years. Phenomenal. One of her very best.Faye Wong is also excellent.And no one comes near Tony Leung Chiu Wai's consistency: incomparable.This DVD release has excellent print. As it should: there are three from this publisher, two single-disk with different covers, and a 2-disc special edition."
5,Works great!,"Many people have written that after-market batteries just don't work right, so I have always ordered the original replacements, and again I am not disappointed...takes a charge, holds a charge and no problems what-so-ever."
5,10 stars! A must for the job seeker!,"If you are or you know someone that is not 100% happy with their career, this book is the answer. After working as a career counselor for over 10 years, Bill's book helped me achieve a position that I absolutely love. I thought I had all the answers after 10 years of advising others -- not so! After reading Bill's book, I obtained a full time position in the Media field within 6 months! No doubt; it works! Superb book for the unemployed AND employed! PS - I negotiated $3,000 more using Bill's techniques!"
3,Cute but that's about all,"I thought this movie would be a little more about baseball. It models a lot of the Baby Eienstien videos and shows colors and sounds that you would find at Fenway Park and shows babies and toddlers playing in Red Sox clothes. My son is two and gets bored with it very quickly, maybe it is Ben Affleck's voice which is very melodramatic the whole time, but it was entertaing only the first time he watched it."
5,"Murder, Mystery, Romance, It's got it all","One of my favorites, Carnal Innocence, is a great book. Nora takes you into the South and gives you a great look at how life there really is. The mystery is definitely not solvable until the end so it keeps you going. The romance is hot, steamy, and will leave you breathless. A must read for any Nora fans out there!"
4,One terrific book!!!,I don't think I have enjoyed a book more since I read Sanctuary. I love how she ties in a murder mystery along with the romance. I love most of her books but this one held me captive right up until the surprisre ending. This is a must read!!!
2,couldn't wait to get to the end,"I love Nora Roberts. I ""think"" I have read and enjoyed everything she has written. Carnal Innocence was so long and boring. I mean realy, it took forever to get to the end. Great ending, but by the time you get there you're like ""oh ya I get it"". I hope the next Nora Robert book has a little more meat it. - Remember ""Northern Lights""? Now that's a Nora Roberts book."
5,Surprising,Just got done finishing the book and all I can say is that I was completely wrong in thinking who the villian was.. Tucker Longstreet is one smooth operator and I wouldn't mind meeting up with him in another book. Give me a Nora Robert's book any time for enjoyment and surprising endings!
3,ok for contemporary,"I have read about 5 books by Nora Roberts. My favorite was Honest Illusions. I tend to read historical romance. A friend gave me my first Nora Roberts' book Born in Fire. That series of three books held my interest to try another book of Ms. Roberts. Honest Illusions I could keep; the others all went back. Tucker and Caro were a good match, but my favorite character was Cy. I had a strong feeling who the killer was during the pathology section in the book. (Don't want to spoiler it for others.) The actual killer isn't revealed until about three pages before the book ends; and I felt some people should have moved out-of-the-area (if you catch my drift). Hard for people to forget and forgive in a story about serial killers. Sorry all you Nora Roberts' fans. I had better stick to historicals."
3,A Good Novel to begin on a rainy day,"This is a novel that I really enjoyed. I've read some others by Nora Roberts and was somewhat bored, but not by this one. It had the usual romance and intrique. It kept my interest with the dual twists and turns of a love affair and murder mystery. The characters are very loveable."
1,October Rust su**s!!!,"This CD is one of the most boring, slow moving albumns I've ever heard. The lyrics are extremely stupid, the music's anoying, just like every other Type O negative albumn I've heard. If you like this band stick with Bloody Kisses. Unlike Bloody Kisses, October Rust has nothing to offer the listener."
1,only heard one song but...,"I saw the video for My Girlfriend's Girlfriend and it was absolutely the worst music I've ever heard. The lyrics were terrible (not that I could understand them) (and lyrics about polyamory have to be pretty awful for me to say something bad about them ;), the music was boring, the voice tried to be creepy and atmospheric but instead wound up clichéd and uninteresting, and the singer had an aura of fakeness. But maybe it's just me. :)"
5,A haunted house for the ears to feast on.,"From the romantic openings of ""Love you to Death"" to the spook filled ""Haunted"", this album covers more ground in a search for personal revelation than any other. The lyricism is thoughtful and intense with just enough low rumbling from guitar to give it extreme depth. ""Red Water"", a carol for the dead. ""In Praise of Bacchus"", an ode to loneliness. ""Die With Me"", love lost. Peter Steele and the boys use every bit of their talent to give fans a true gift. Forever Negative."
5,Awesome Book For The Enlightened But Not Whimpy,"This is an awesome book! Kumani is so brave to write it. It's very colorful and wonderfully descriptive. I would recommend it for mature readers only. Not for the over religious or nievely educated consumer. If you are intrigued by Asian female writers and can handle a bit of the bizarre, if you are able to be open minded with the frequent disturbing images then hopefully you will enjoy this book! I will look for future books by Ginu Kumani!"
5,A gem!,"This is a warm and lovely story of a young man's quest for independence, friendship and love. And Alex does find it all after much struggles depicted by hilarious yet touching and heart warming moments. Lorena Manuel is a fine and luminous writer, each of her characters vivid and distinct. It is so easy to like Alex. His lover, mother and sister are endearing too. I look forward to Miss Manuel's next effort."
1,Worst work boots ever made!,"I just bought these boots at the end of August and less then three months later i am replacing them. My current line of work is not even rough on boots but these began to fall apart in the first month, wearing holes in the toes and having the plastic connection for the safety toe break apart inside the boot. I have never had a less durable boot."
3,Mixture comes up short,"Dog Eat Dog is able to mix rap and rock, but I was not impressed with this Cd because it had no focus. I am hoping they will come up with some more interesting lyrics on there next album. They might be a great group in the future."
2,not that great..........,"ok Deicide really isnt all that great like alot of people say they are. This cd has two good songs: When Satan Rules His World and Trick or Betrayed. The rest just aint that good. For death metal, i prefer In Flames and At The Gates. Those guys are creative. Deicide is just bland, boring, and monotonous for the most part. Oh yeah the extremely satanic and blasphemous lyrics start to sound old and lame very quicklyBottom line: If you want truly great metal, go with Iced Earth, Venom, In Flames, At The Gates, Death, Type O Negative, Emperor, or Cradle of Filth"
3,"Good, But gets old after a while...","This is definetly a metal classic, from one of death metals most influencial bands. It Starts off as a killer album, with heavy relentless riffing, killer vocals, and traditional death metal drumming. but it is a bit repeditive so I have to give it 4 out of 5. I would highly recommend Vital Remains's 'dechristianize' over this album (vital remains fetures glen benton from deicide on vocals) \m/"
4,Damn Mean,This is not for the squemish or the Godly. Pure aggression is the easiest way to describe this volume of Blasphemous tunes. The only detraction is the repetative vocalization style being the rhythm and speach patern are too redundent at times. Still one heavy album.
1,Whatta 'dee thy alboum say?,What deicide? What woes that sathanic diske withy terrifik noise meanne? Anothar bad alboum. Thy albums must copoun!
4,Falls short of Legion,"OK, possibly the heaviest Deicide release, equal with Insineratehym, this is probably Deicide's most celebrated album, but IMO Legion is the greatest Deicide release. Glen is furious as usual, the groove is there, some of the hooks have improved, but unfortunately, the brutality has dripped a little bit. It is a great release, don't get me wrong, but some of the songs are a little bland and drop off in places, whereas Legion was perfect. Once Upon the Cross has Spawned classics such as the title track (one of my fav. Deicide songs!), Kill the Christian and They Are the Children of the Underworld. It's not as technical as Legion but more technical than Deicide.It's kinda hard to describe this cd, its good in places but falls short in others... Know what I mean? It's good stuff though, not a really essential buy."
3,AN ALRIGHT PARANORMALITY BOOK.,"This is an average paranormalality book.Some of the stories are well-known ones like the mystery of the ""Burmuda Triangle"" when Flight-19 and some other planes of the USAF went missing without trace.The most interesting story is that 14 years before the tragic 1st class ""Titanic"" ferry sunk because it hit an ice berg was that someone(a ""ghost"" writer) wrote a book about a fictional ship named the ""Titan"" got hit with an ice berg and also lots of passengers died now that is no co-incidence and i bet none of yous could explain that!!! this book is good but not as good as my favorate paranormal book ""Strange But True"".bye."
5,The Christmas Cookie Book by Judy Knipe and Barbara Marks,"I have never been very good with cookies, but thought I'd give it one more try. Since receiving this book from Amazon.com I have made six different cookies using their techniques and recipes and they have all been excellent and easy to make. Good directions abound."
4,price,"As below, go to hittinthenote dot com for this disc. Have not heard yet so disregard my rating, had to post something there"
4,Different format,"This is a bit different than I expected, as each ""story"" ranges from just a few paragraphs to a number of pages. I really enjoyed it however, and anyone who likes a glimpse into the world of emergency medicine will enjoy it too. Only downside is the lack of availability of a Kindle download."
4,Incredibly Interesting! Humorous insights...,"Emergency Room doctors and nurses share stories that absolutely shocked me in this book. Many of the stories seem too bizarre to be true, but then again truth often is stranger than fiction! These docs and nurses are surprisingly compassionate with people who have committed all sorts of indecent, sometimes ridiculous, often vulgar acts to themselves or others. This is a very original compilation of some of the best and worst case histories in the field of emergency medicine. Caution: Reading before bedtime may give one nightmares! Great Book!"
3,A huge disappointment,"I didn't enjoy this game very much at all. It's not a bad game, by any means, but it's not the perfect 10 everyone else seems to think. The original Zelda for the NES is much more fun. In Twilight Princess, you spend gobs of time just wandering back and forth over the same areas. The temples/dungeons and bosses are mostly very easy, as is most of the combat. Midna and Wolf Link are pretty cool additions, but constantly digging for rupees as Wolf Link was both aggravating and silly. I liked Zelda better when it was all about the puzzles and combat, before it went all 3D and tried adding story to the mix."
3,Can you say OVERRATED?,"I'm sorry, but this is NOT the best Zelda of all time, nor is it fit to lick Ocarina Of Time's boots. First and foremost, the game is just NOT FUN. It's ridiculously linear. The towns, for lack of a better word, suck. Wait until you see what passes for Kakariko Village this time around. And the village you begin in will put you to sleep. There's too many boring cutscenes, for another thing. And the twilight segments just blow (again, for lack of a better word). They're extremely tedious. Admittedly, there's still a lot of the game left to play, but I doubt that it improves substantially. I can only hope, though. Why not just replay Ocarina Of Time or Majora's Mask, I wonder?"
1,Not worthy of the Zelda name.,"If this game was anything but a Zelda game it would be good, but its not worthy of the name. Way too much plot like a final fantasy and not enough freedom to run around, too many open spaces with nothing in them, why not put in some creatures that are fun to kill or secretes and upgrades. Being the wolf is just boring, why not just stay link, it serves no purpose, you cant use any objects as the wolf. The graphics are WAY TOO OVERRATED. They are muddy and some times you can't tell an object from the background. Why not build some art inbetween OOT and WW to stay traditional instead of something that looks like LOTR on PS2. I love the other Zelda games, but this one is not a Zelda, hope it is not a sign of things to come."
4,Excellent Work,"The developers took a lot of time and resources to make this game. It's excellent work. Even so, a lot of the material is borrowed from OoT other iterations. It takes away from the originality. I think the forest should be much more expanded and explorable. It seems very isolated to me, and very predictable where you CAN go. Also, the Kokiri didn't make any kind of cameo appearance from OoT. I was hoping to see a little of that."
5,Another great Zelda title!,Great price for a remarkable game that truly has to be experienced by anyone who owns a Gamecube. I thought it might not be all the different from recent Zeldas (and in some ways it isn't..) but for the most part a great value even at 50 dollars.
4,"Extent history remarks,the best for intro","I must say that it was extremelly helpfull as i got to learn more about what is surrounding us. Well written also,simple, with mathematical references"
2,This one never really gets off the ground,"My Dad gave me this book, which had "" Weeks & weeks of NY times best seller"". I don't see how. The story is very simplistic. An American is caught up in political intrigue in Spain. It smacks of a very bad James Bond plot. Some of the characters are interesting, but they are never fully developed. You are left with a sense that something is going to happen ...then it never does. There was potential here, but the authors failure to get off the ground make this book a ""pass it by""."
2,Inexcusably bad sound,"Although the performance is typically MTT [i.e.,acceptably good], the sound is unacceptably bad - don't reward the recording group by purchasing this CD."
2,"Weak, but may be a first step for the uninitiated","There is little to be said here but that the sloppiness and inaccuracies of these discs left me regretting the purchase, though some topics of individual interest do come up and will entertain an interested newcomer to the subject.For anyone in the market for a solid, scholarly set on DVD that will pay dividends both as an introduction and as a guide to further study, look for Professor Harl's World of Byzantium published by the Teaching Company. It's pricey but worth it, and from time to time turns up at very reasonable prices."
1,I can watch it just about 20 minutes.,"No subtitle, no computer graphics in this film! Cameraman followed Romer around to show his rear end is very annoying! Romer's presentation is comic and boring. I can watch it just about 20 minutes. I read extensively about Byzantium history and Ottosman Turkey history. This film hardly impresses me at all! This maybe a little personal. I wish future producers can use CG to present Byzantium architectures in their original form without current Moslem alteration! Many Chinese historical documentation films have already used CG extensively to restore artifacts in their original historical form. Romer's hand gesture and movement are really annoying! CGs can be great substitution!"
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!,I could not wait for this DVD to arrive. Almost every review given on this site was positive. Now I must believe that all positive reviews must be from friends and relatives of Romer. This is one of the most boring documentaries I have ever watched. I was two hours into it before I finally gave up. I just could not believe something better wasn't on the horizon. I kept wondering if I had received the right DVD. The only reason to watch this documentary is if you need a really good nap.
4,Good Movie,"Being an avid Tony Hillerman fan, I was thrilled to see there was a movie about one of my favorite books, Coyote Waits. It is a PBS movie produced by Robert Redford, who I understand is also a Tony Hillerman fan. So often I find that a movie is not nearly as enjoyable as the original book, but this movie follows the book quite excellently, so there was no disappointment there. I highly recommend this movie to any Tony Hillerman fan or anyone who enjoys a good, challenging mystery!"
5,Conversations with the Fat Girl had me from hello,"From the first introduction to the main character, Maggie, I was drawn into her psyche as she was puzzled as to why there was a bulldozer parked in front of her house. She confronts her quirky landlord only to find out she's being evicted and her house is going to be torn down. This turns out to be a minor problem for Maggie in light of the other struggles she faces in the book...being used and mistreated by her best friend, stuck at a dead end job which she is overqualified for, and desiring an intimate relationship with a co-worker, but unable to disclose her true feelings. In the beginning, I wanted to befriend Maggie because of her wit and honest self-talk. By the end of the book, I wanted to embrace Maggie for having the courage to confront her own insecurities and go after the things in life that she deeply desired."
3,good,"I wouldn't have bought this product except it was recomended to purchase along with decal paper, however it is NECESSARY to keep your decal from pealing off the model."
4,A ROLE MODEL,"Johnson was the perfect RAF Wing LEader: inspiring to his pilots, skilfull, concise. The book has its flaws in regarding to writing style. It was written in 1956. It gives a great general portrait of RAF operations in Europe in WW II ( Johnson lived through it all ). He served in 616 Squadron, then led 610 Squadron then became Wing Leader of a Canadian wing. Sometimes he chose to not reveal the names of a lot of people he describes in the book. I don't know why he did it. In general, a great work for the afficionados."
2,DRYLY WRITTEN,Johnson is too dry in his writing style. The result is that you couldn't care lessa bout his exploits or the exploits of the men under his command. No doubt this book is a classic and Johnsonw as the supreme British RAF man. But the book is badly written.
2,Worst practice book EVER,"I highly doubt that Barron's is the #1 choice. I was practicing the math problems and they made 2 errors in 2 sections already. Here are the mistakes:If 7x+5=74 what is the value of SQRT(7x-5)A) 7 B) 8 C)9 D)10 E)11Answer is BThe answer key says C and the their explanation says C as well, but when they work out the problem and they ended up getting 8 which is what B is -__-For the Answer Key Verbal section problem number 2 answer is I even though it is only from A-E. I was very disappointed and put the book away with anger.DO NOT BUY THIS. It has mostly correct answers but it also contains at least 5 errors total. They aren't the official stuff that shows up on the real test so not a very reliable source to practice with. No book shall be purchased if it contains more than 1 error"
5,Thank you Barron's,"Thanks to this book I did so well (1360 -- I only got 1040 when I took the PSAT in 10th grade) that I am really feeling confident about my SATs this spring. The book taught me everything I needed to know. I improved much more than my friends who took courses. The tactics REALLY helped a lot. I found out that I could get a higher score by not trying to answer all the questions. The math sections in particular were great. Even though your PSAT scores aren't sent to colleges, you want the experience of good scores before you take the SAT. GET THIS BOOK!"
2,"Too many errors, unrealistic.","Okay, at first glance, this book looks great. 7 tests (one of which is a diagnostic), compared to the other new PSAT books' 2 or 3, and a giant vocab list, holy crap - MUST BUY, right?NO. This book has tons of errors, and yes, I am talking about the 12th edition released in 2004. I'm talking like ~2-6 completely wrong answers a test, and even more typos and wrong underlining, which is extremely frustrating, especially under timed conditions. It's the TWELFTH EDITION for christ's sake. Also, this book covers some math that is not on the real test, and is overall, known to be way harder than the PSATS actually are. You will get ~40 points lower than you should, which is not necessarily a good thing. The errors and the crappy questions are the cause for the low score, not because it is ""challenging"" you and is making you a better test taker by giving tough questions. Do not buy. It's a waste of your time and money."
4,Very Nice New Flamenco - True to Windham Hill,"If you are accustomed to Windham Hill recordings, I think you will find that this Flamenco CD will fit nicely into the WH ""genre"". The feel is light and easy and bordering really on a smooth-jazz feel. Great listening for overall guitar excellence but for those who are Flamenco purists (I am not) they may find themselves disappointed.I love the recording and enjoy it as nice guitar music. It is hard to color it as truly Flamenco though."
4,Interesting Read,"Pleasant book, not as funny as I'd hoped; however reviewers indicate the next in the series is much better written, so I'm going to try it!This one is a pleasant read."
5,"Enjoyable Mystery, fast paced and entertaining!","I read this as a free Kindle read, and now am hooked! What a great series, can't wait to read the rest of the books which I just purchased- yes they are that good. I wasn't sure when I started to read all about hunting but amazingly the writing was clear, and managed to keep me reading and even understanding. I can't wait for my hubby to read the series, the humor is spot on and the flow of the action kept me reading. Excellent writer. Am so glad that Kindle made the first book a freebie, I might not have been attracted to a book with hunting deer as part of the plot, but this book is so much more. Kudos!"
5,"Not a review, but an update of product specifications!","The 3044 pictured here actually comes with the Seiko made NH35A movement which is ""hackable"" Meaning that when you pull the crown out the seconds hand stops so you can set the time and synchronize with other clocks easier. It is also able to be wound manually by turning the crown. It has 24 jewels instead of the 21 that is stated. I talked to the supplier Discount Watch Store and their representative confirmed this with me. Just thought I would let everyone know so they know what a great deal this is! :)"
4,encyclopedia's review,You should get the book Encyclopedia Brown and the case of the mysterious hand prints because it is a great book.Donald J. Sobol wrote many Encyclopedia Brown's and this is the best by far. If you like mystery books Encyclopedia Brown and the case of the mysterious hand prints is the book for you.
1,A Very Stupid Movie,"Out of touch with any kind of reality and an insult to everyone. There is not one thing that makes the least sense in this movie. Start with day one when Stallone supposedly loses hearing in one ear bashing out a car window with his head. Don't hurt yourself but try putting your head against a wall or something and even getting your ear to touch it.Keitel and buddies go around murdering any police officers who make any mistakes, presumably it tarnishes the image of their perfect community. All put together, this movie is a series of dumb actions by people who had no real motive to do such dumb things.Another stupid movie good for nothing but insulting intelligence. Another movie I am glad I only paid a quarter for, for a used VHS, and even that was a waste of money."
3,Sly,"If you like Sly you might not like this one. If you like Film, and dislike Sly for the most part, you might want to check this one out. Copland is a fresh flick with a strong cast. Special Features are good, soundtrack is kinda fresh too.Buy used at least."
4,A nice update to a semi classic,The gritty cop movie from the 90s does well with this Blu-ray edition. The visuals are fairly well presented without too much softening. The movie storyline is an interesting one that covers fictional rogue police officers in a small New Jersey town. Sylvester Stallone stars as a partially deaf sheriff who must confront the rogue police officers while dealing with the many difficulties of police life.
3,Gestapoland,"This is an intersting movie about a man's fight against the folies of an apparently police-run (party-)state, and how in the end the good wins. It is quite entertaining. As always, reality is worse than the fiction. or is it ?"
5,Great Movie,"In so many ways this movie intrigued me. I've seen it multiple times and with each viewing, there's something new to appreciate. First and most obvious, to me, is Sylvester Stallone (whom I'm no fan been a fan of, believing him to be one-dimensional) who absolutely wowed me in this movie, and though I'm still not a fan, I do appreciate just the depth w/which he acted in Cop Land. Really impressive and a tribute to either him or the director...or who/whatever helped him play this character.That aside, there's a lot more to appreciate...the story, the intensity, the characters (there wasn't bad acting on anyone's part). It's become one of my favorites because I know whenever I'm in the mood to see this movie, I know there'll be something I never noticed in prior viewings that make me appreciate it even more. I'm no movie connoisseur but Cop Land helped me appreciate the finer points of making a good movie, in a subtle way, w/big, fat emotions."
5,INFO & TRACK LISTING,"Quirky, nervous pop from the Go-Betweens; a classic now very scarce. 22 tracks on Beggar's Banquet:1 Hammer the Hammer2 Cattle and Cane3 Man O'Sand to Girl O'Sea4 Bachelor Kisses5 Draining the Pool for You6 Spring Rain7 The Clarke Sisters8 Right Here9 Bye Bye Pride10 The House that Jack Kerouac Built11 Streets of Your Town12 Love is a Sign13 I Need Two Heads14 When People are Dead15 People Say16 World Weary17 Rock and Roll Friend18 Dusty in Here19 Second-hand Furniture20 This Girl, Black Girl21 Don't Call Me Gone22 You Won't Find it Again"
2,Around the World in 80 Days,I found this audio book very boring. It did not hold my interest at all. I bought this book because of the person that was the reader. I have all of the Harry Potter books and Jim Dale is an excellent reader. But this book just was not my cup of tea.
3,The Eighty Days of going Around the World,It was a long journey that had twists and turns that were exciting and fun. It was about a bet that started in 1873 in London. They bet that they could get back around the world in eighty days. It starts out slow and gets better during the book. Like when they get attacked by a Indian group. It is pretty good after geting started.
4,Fun book,"Not that Jules cares one way or the other what my review is, but I liked this book. I never read it as a child and had only seen it on tv or in class or something. But I seem to remember something on the cover of the movie about them in a hot air balloon. I have avoided this book. I did not want to read it. No interest what so ever. But then I started to read other Verne books and really like the way he writes. More, I like the detail that he provides. So... there is THIS book. I went into it quite hesitant. It did not take but a few minutes and I was in this fun little world for the next few days. If you are a JV fan, then you will enjoy this book.For the uninitiated, don't worry, there is no silliness about floating off in a balloon. It is a good read."
4,Highly entertaining!,I enjoyed this story very much. Quite an entertaining plot with a great ending!
5,Yay! The X-wing series lives!,"Yes! I knew the X-wing series wouldn't die! I was so pleased when I found this book, I laughed hysterically and got some very strange looks from other library-users. I love all the characters, with maybe the exception of Myn Donos. I like him, but he bugs me. I can't explain it. Oh, I just love what you've done with Janson! I liked him the first time I saw tESB, I know I just love him! This book totally rules, and I'm giving it a six out of five even though this stupid computer says I can't!"
5,Very good book!,This book was very well done. I liked the way the author made the characters sound like they were real and liked to joke around. The Bothan (Grinder) and the Mon Calamari (Jesmin Ackbar) shouldn't have died.
5,Amazing...,"I'm looking over some of the other reviews, and I'm amazed at how some people don't understand this book. Some people think the Kell-Tyria love story is too shallow. WELL... Allston had originally put more in there, but it had been edited out (or so I was told). People thought the plot was too predictable. WELL... it was predictable to the point that the good guys were going to win. We all knew that anyway, it's the getting there that's fun! And some people think that Allston just can't fill Stackpole's shoes. Well, to those people, wait until Isard's Revenge and don't bother to read another X-Wing book until then. You're just too much hooked on Stackpole, so give it up.This book was simply incredible, and one of the best written books I've ever read. Enjoy it!"
2,"sorry to be the smart one guys,but....","This book was sooooooo....predictable!! I have had it with these second rate imps! they're bumbling fools in this book! With out good bad guys they're would be no real threat!! all imp loalist know what I'm talking about.the good guys got away with EVERYTHING. NOTHING went wrong(okay maybe a couple things went wrong)!I am So #!%#^$@* sick of female New Republic HUSSIES, who go there to spy!!!! One good thing, YUB YUB commander! `"
2,Would have been better if not for the first four.,"Although Aaron Allston did a good job on this book, It wasn't even close to the quality of Stackpole's first four. Throughout the novel I constantly compared Stackpole's writing style to Allston's and, as a consequence, found myself missing Corran, Tycho, Mirax, and Stackpole's much broader vocabulary (Including his ability never to have the word ""said"" appear in his novels) Although I realized different authors shouldn't be compared in such ways, I guess I couldn't help it. So, if you don't mind making the transition from Rogues to Wraiths or from Stackpole to Allston, you'll have no trouble with this book. However, if different authors taking over have annoyed you in the past,(ex. KJA for BH in Darksaber,) you might want to skip to I, Jedi right now while you're waiting for the 8th X-Wing book.(which is going to be written by Stackpole)"
4,Duel in the Sun,It was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. I am now a Jennifer Jones fan. She was quite the vixen in this film. It's the only time I've seen Gregory Peck as a jerk. I'll have to watch it again.
5,brother battles brother for the love of a woman,"This a classic western from 1946. Gregory Peck did one of his finest jobs of acting playing the hot-blooded Lewt McCanles.(He should have won an Oscar for this performance). Lewt's brother, Jesse played by (Joseph Cotton), is the opposite of Lewt clearheaded and calm. They become rivals when they meet Pearl played by (Jennifer Jones), a beautiful half-breed Indian girl who comes to live on their ranch.Though she's won over by Lewt, his volatile nature ultimately leads to trouble, igniting the film's explosive climax. This is a unlikely ending in any movie today. But is pulled off nicely by Peck & Jones. This film should go down as one of hollywood's top 100 movies of all-time."
4,Demons no match for God,"I have found the advice of John and Paula Sandford very helpfull in the past. So I was intrested in this colaboration with his son Mark. First I liked how they directed you to take resposibility for your actions, and made it clear that we can not use Demons as an excuse for our harmful acts, we provide the furtile ground. In the end it is God who leads us to God, but it is great to have people like John and Mark, dedicated to helping us when we get stuck along the way. If you are ready to take responsibility for your life, this is a great book to help you along."
2,title of review,"I'm a bit puzzled by this album being considered hardcore. This is just weak grunge metal. If you want to listen to music like this you'd be much better served by picking up Alice In Chains' Dirt, Metallica's Self-titled, and Type O Negative's Slow Deep And Hard. This album is nothing more than a second rate amalgam of those albums."
4,More of a Frontline Assembly album than actual FF,"Fear is the Mindkiller sounds more like a Frontline Assembly album than Fear Factory. It has moderate use of guitars, dark industrial noises and dance-like drums that are all present in Frontline Assembly's normal discs. The way Fulber and Leeb remixed this album made it much better in my opinion, something was lacking in the original Soul of a New Machine but they make a sort of FLA-featuring Burton C Bell that sounds great. His hellish screams are a great addition to the dark style of music they are known for."
5,These remixes are awesome!,"First off, I love Fear Factory and I am one of the very few that truly enjoyed and understood their other EP, Remanufacture. While that cd was one of the most ambitious and daring remix albums to be released in quite some time, this is your standard remix album. But the remixes kick extreme butt! They are very listenable, just as enjoyable as the originals. Anyone who like Soul of a New Machine or Remanufacture should really enjoy this, even though i reccomend it to all fans of Fear Factory. Oh yeah, why are there only 6 reviews for this album? It rocks!"
5,One of His Best,"If you become a Robert Earl Keen, Jr. fan as I have, you probably own most or all of his music. I would put this CD just below West Textures and Gringo Honeymoon, and far above some of his others. Amarillo Highway and Corpus Christi Bay are a great start to this re-release, and other highlights include the story of ""Jesse"" (that song is good once you figure out the story), Night Right for Love, Paint the Town Beige and Crazy Cowboy Dreams. If you are a fan of REK you will not regret buying this CD!"
5,1trini,"I have been wearing Clarks a long time. Not sure what happened with the company over the last 5 or 6 years.I cannot purchase the shoe that I want.6 or 7 years ago I purchase a pair of size 10 mens Chromium Ankle Boot # 36623, Brown Leather ( Beautiful shoe), I still have it and it is in great condition - wear it all the time; I should have purchase 2 or 3 pair in different colors.Clarks have stopped making them and started making all these weird fitting items.I wish you would start making shoes like these again.You need to go back to what got you to this point."
3,Groovy,"OK. So this is a movie about Sonny and Cher making a movie. And it has Sonny and Cher in it.You can sure tell this is a 1960s movie. The clothes look as if they were all made by demented monkeys working with remaindered material. Some of the cinematic effects are bizarre. The plot, such as it is, involves a kind of unholy pact to get a movie done. I can only assume Sonny and Cher signed on the dotted line.It's not to say that there isn't some funny scenes. The commentary on the film industry is biting. The fantasy pieces were OK. Amazingly, the music isn't that good, which is bizarre as you would think this movie would have been written to highlight Sonny and Cher's talents.The thing is, this is so campy that it's hard not to like it."
3,Must Have For Cher Fans,This is actually nothing for somebody who is not a big fan of either Cher or Sonny & Cher.
2,R. Elliott,"Price was misleading, once the high shipping rate was added, the tea was no longer the 'deal' it was promoted to be. Although once it finally arrived, it was half decent tea, but NOT worth the shipping and the wait, will go to my local tea house next time."
3,NOT GREAT BUT ALSO NOT BAD- you would have to try it for yourself,I think it depends on the state of your injury. At times I found the product to work very well.Other times it did not work at all depending on the condition of my athletic injuries.Absorbs fast through the skin and does not stain clothes
2,Didn't work for me,"Came highly recommended by my yoga instructor, so I tried it. Worked a little on my heel spur pain (for which it doesn't seem to be designed), but for aching in my finger knuckles, did nothing. I really did want it to work. My yoga instructor said it worked miraculously on what sounded like a trigger finger. So maybe just not for everyone."
4,Good Value,"The silk the design is printed on is ""pebbled"", not smooth. Design is cute. Good value for the price."
2,not sheer,"this bodystocking is definitely not sheer, more semi-opaqueit also runs easily and doesn't feel smooth to the touchi'm still looking for a quality sheer bodystocking"
1,Very little information that is tennis specific,"I have been working out for over fifty years and found this book to be a big disappointment. There are a few pages stating how your tennis will benefit from weight training. Other than that, there is almost nothing that is tennis specific.I found this book to be a complete waste of money for anyone who already has knowledge of weight training in general. I did not see any new exercises that were not already described in various other weight training manuals.If you are a novice to weight training, this book may be of some value to you. However, there are better weight training books out there."
1,Dont mistaken this for the band WARRANT,"Don't make the mistake I did and thought this was a release from the hair metal band WARRANT (Cherry Pie, Heaven, Uncle Toms Cabin)I thought this mightev been a single release or somethign because WARRNAT also have an album called DOG EAT DOG and I thought maybe these where demo tracks that didnt make it onto the album.But this is a band called Dog Eat Dog and the album is called Warrant.My impresion of this band.....They need music lessons and cant sing for S***"
4,"This book is funny, warm, entertaining and enlightening!","I've read the book twice - so there's no doubt that I love it! I've read or heard some of the stories prior to reading them here (or a similar version - I think many of us may have.) But what makes this collection of stories special is the afterthoughts. The afterthoughts provide foundation for the stories, help us see the bits of wisdom in them and aid us in understanding why the stories have endured."
3,Interesting Variety of Stories,"I read this book over the course of a couple of months, and I enjoyed having the short stories to read one at a time. There is a mixture of happy endings and not so happy endings, and stories about rich folks, poor folks, old folks, young folks, and even white folks. I would reccomend this book for a good enjoyable and thought provoking read."
5,Bloody Kisses: TON's best album!,"This album is a true gothic metal mastepiece without a doubt. Christian Woman, Black No.1, Too Late/Frozen, Kill All The White People, We Hate Everyone, Summer Breeze, Set Me On Fire, and Bloody Kisses are my favorite songs on here. Peter Steele's vocals are just great. Kenny Hickey has some cool guitar riffs, and Josh Silver's keyboards really gives this album that beautiful atmospheric sound. There's some good drumming as well. So if you're new to Type O Negative, Bloody Kisses along with October Rust are great albums to start with. Type O Negative rules!Ratings:1. Machine Screw: N/A2. Christian Woman: 5/53. Black No.1: 5/54. Fay Wray Come Out And Play: N/A5. Kill All The White People: 5/56. Summer Breeze: 5/57. Set Me On Fire: 5/58. Dark Side Of The Womb: N/A9. We Hate Everyone: 5/510. Bloody Kisses: 5/511. 3.0.I.F: N/A12. Too Late/Frozen: 5/513. Blood And Fire: 5/514. Can't Lose You: 5/5"
4,One of their best albums,This album is very good. It has two amazing songs (Black no 1 + Cristian Woman) and the other tracks are good with some exceptions. If you like very slow atmospheric metal /gothic songs then this is your album. Its not so good as October rust but similar to this
4,Death - 'Symbolic' (Roadrunner) 4 1/2 stars,"'Symbolic' was the band's sixth CD.Have always thought that Death was ANOTHER under-appreciated death metal band(no pun intended there).Notice that ex-Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan is on the album.Top of the line in-your-face screaming death metal is what you get with Death.Cuts that I thought were the best include ""1,000 Eyes"",""Misanthrope"",""Perennial Quest"" and ""Zero Tolerance"".A sad note,Death's main man,guitarist/vocalist Chuck Schuldiner had passed on awhile back from having a brain tumor.Should appeal to fans of Obituary,Carcass,Morbid Angel and Napalm Death."
3,Good Product/Bad Fit,"The product was good, only issue was it didnt quite fit my Silverstone FT-02 with a fullsize ATX mobo. Also, I didn't like how the front stuck out a little past my other drives once inserted fully into my case, but that's my personal preference."
3,Redgrave gives a fantastic performance,"Besides qualms with the musical score, Wetherby has a killer script, intriguing editing, fantastic acting (Vanessa Redgrave is incredible), and a compelling idea driving the film. I liked the echoes of film noir in the intense, high-contrast lighting; the starkness of the violence was perfect, especially when combined with naked silence. It is more than a story about a disturbed young man who shoots himself in front of an aging school teacher, Jean Travers (Redgrave). That comes early in the film. It is about the psychological consequences for Jean in her life and past that are violently revealed through that shocking act. Life can never be normal again. Beneath even the most pleasant veneer lurks sadness, secrets, and dark sexuality."
1,BORING AND AWEFUL!!!,"This movie has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It seemed by the description to be worth watching, but trust me, it's more exciting watching paint dry than wasting time on this junk. How many times can a person watch people walk? The only part that peaks interest is the beginning, where the guy shoots himself. I cannot believe there are people who like this movie!!! If you don't believe me, go ahead, watch it....you WILL be sorry you did."
3,ok as far as it goes,"The year is not new enough. When I had that year Vehicle it was ok. I have a '98 Quad Cab, and Trannie went out, I wanted to research it. Cant find a book. My wife has a '98 quad cab and the trannie went. The front wheel bearings are supposed to be greasable in my V-10, Need to find out how to do that. Need the book. Asked for one from the Library, but nothing has come back yet. thanks Mike"
2,The problem with arbitrary collections...,"The problem with arbitrary collections is sometimes that not every piece in it is of equal quality.While the ""Over Arizona"" DVD is a masterpiece, one can also like very much the ""Dreaming"" series, the Globe Trekker Southwest USA is a misfit, seek the separate reviews of this... how to call it, Ms. Shapiro twisted view of the Southwest?My other very different problem with this product is that the box holding the DVD's is too narrow. It takes me usually a letter opener wedged in to the box to fiddle out one of the DVD's in a torturous 20min job. Finally I tossed out the ""Trecker DVD"" from the box, which proven to be almost ok for 3 DVD's. Please make the box 1/8 of the inch wider!"
4,Great for information on the rest of Orlando,"This book was very helpful during our recent trip. I packed it in the backpack to carry in the theme park. I found it highly superior to the Birnbaum book on Disney because this one will tell which rides are worth missing and which are must see's. The Birnbaum book, being the ""official"" Disney book is just a little too rosy about everything. Hidden Orlando gives the real scoop. I loved the section on Sea World too."
4,Portrait of Jennie,They sure don't make movies like that any more. It is so refreshing not to hereprofanity in a movie or absence shots. why cant they make movies like that now days ?Its a very good movie to watch with a loved one. I would have to give this movie.****
1,Bad customer service from Total Health Discount,Total Health Discount had these the cheapest. I ordered them and 13 days later they sent me an email saying that they were out of stock. I got on Amazon to write a bad review and the company still says it has one order still in stock. Do yourself a favor and order from another company. Higher Mind pills are great and worth the trouble finding below the store price.
4,The note,"I loved reading this book. And after reading it, i got the DVD - and that was even more awesome. I also read The Note II which is the follow on...."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!!,"I haven't read a book all the way through since I got stuck in the middle of the fourth book of the Left Behind Series last summer! I bought this book last Thursday evening and longed to return home from being out with my friends and family on Friday and Saturday nights just to read the book! I finished it on Sunday night with the intent of only finishing the next chapter.. I was up until 1:00am! The book was a total wake up call for those of us who may have stale or unhappy relationships with our parents, particularly with your father. You just never know how someone or something may touch your life. I think Angela wrote this story with the intent of having her reader desire to finish the book and go out and embrace their loved ones. Everything happens for a reason and God has His hand in everything we do, whether or not we see it as it's occurring! Wonderful read.. recommended from a person who can't ever finish a book but has started a million of them!"
1,Not complete boxed set,"The picture and title of item was deceptive, as the picture shows all 6 books and says boxed set, but the item was an older boxed set which only included Books 1-3. I am trying to find books 4-6 now so I can complete the boxed set."
1,old edition,don't buy this copy. this is a 2nd edition book published in 2001 - the 3rd edition (released may 2003) is already out at the same price. Buy the new edition and get more for your money.
2,Superficial material,"This book was far too superficial to use as a review book for shelf exams or to obtain an adequate understanding in general surgery. I would recommend the Lawrence surgery book, which takes longer to read, but at least you are gaining a better grasp of the material."
2,Not suitable for USMLE,"This book contains not much of details for USMLE. Even you have very little time left and lots of topics to cram, don't think about this one."
5,!Black Mamba!,this watch reminds me of kobe looks badass lethal watch! everyone has to digg this watch!
5,Maravilloso,"Este reloj es realmente muy llamativo, los números grandes y los detalles del cronógrafo en amarillo lo hacen muy deportivo sin perder esa característica que lo diferencia de los relojes corrientesLos mandos colocados a la izquierda del tablero en la posición de las nueve lo hacen más cómodo aun si usted lo usa en la mano izquierda por que le molestarán menos en el dorso de la mano cuando se mueve, lo cual es una incomodidad en relojes de este tamaño.Es bastante preciso sin ser un reloj específicamente promovido por su exactitud.."
5,awesome watch,"i got this watch about a week ago and have worn it everyday since. i wear it on my left hand because i am right handed. got this watch even though it a lefty watch because i really liked the look of it. the crown does not bother my arm in the least and is still usable. it is a fairly large watch, not as big as the diver i was looking at before, but you will get comments on its size and although it is large the watch is pretty light. the minute hand on the crono is a little hard to see but other then that the watch is very readable. it is however not as bright at night as i would have liked but it is still bright enough. if you want to make this watch go with more clothes by changing out the band you do not need a tool to take the band off, although im having trouble finding the invicta 22mm bands. over all an awesome watch and im saving up for another!!"
4,Good... Not Great!!!,"The watch its not as big as some other invictas i have seen... it's light and pretty good looking, you should know the crown its glossy, and it does look like its somewhat more expensive, even when back in the day i paid 175$ for it...The real problem with it is i didnt realized this whatch is designed for lefties, and when they say that they mean it. The adjustment knob digs into my wrist when i wear it in my left arm. its something to consider if you're a righty.Another thing i didn't like that much was the band. It was a little on the thin side for my tastes, but i'm sure many people won't have a problem with it.."
4,Good Independent Film,"This is a good independent film from a young ambitious filmmaker. The story centers around Jimarcus who is a marketing executive for a record label, and his girlfriend Latrisha an aspiring model. Jimarcus's co worker and college friend Deshawn does not care for Latrisha too much, as he feels that they are moving too fast. Latrisha begins talking to a mysterious guy on the internet and choas ensues. There are twists and turns in this movie that i won't spoil for you. Good script, good cast, and good director on this one. It's definitely worth checking out if you like independent films."
3,Seems good...,"I give this Leap Pad book 3 stars for fun because my children were not interested enough to even look at all the pages.They played with it a lot, but did not get even half way through, maybe that just means it is full of fun stuff to do, but since my kids have not gone back to it, I feel it does not hold their interest quite enough. Educational, 4 stars because some of it seemed a bit simple, like the space page. 5 stars for durability because it is no more and no less durable then regular Leap Pad books. Dont like the eraseable pen though. Must cover it each and every time, even between questions. If it's off more then 5 seconds, it dries out.I peronally did not find it very easy to keep picking up and putting down pens. I tried using a pen in each hand, and it dried out, so I had to keep putting down the regular ""pen"" to cover up the eraseable pen. Pretty annoying."
2,Not a real representation of Alaska,"I live in Alaska, and this movie does not portray Alaska properly. Bears are not predatory towards humans, and the bear in this movie is a real work of fiction. I would hate people to see this and think that real bears act this way, because they never do. Bears do not hunt down humans, nor see them as a food source or enemy. By far the most dangerous thing in Alaska is the weather and remoteness, not the wildlife. If you can get past how ridiculous the bear is in the film, it is mildly entertaining."
5,the Edge,great movie. purchased this awhile ago as a gift for my husband. finally watched the movie and it was in perfect condition. I will recommend this seller and the movie.
4,attention grabber...left me on the edge of my seat!!!!,fast paced storyline that kept my interest. would reccomend it to all action seekers....
1,The Edge,The VHS for which I so relieved still exist was for my 86 yr old uncle who had loaded his out and never received back. He plays it over and over again.Thank you so much for the prompt service and having it available in VHS.
5,Breathtaking,"""The Edge"" is a breathtaking movie. It has great cinematography, excellent writing, two very strong performances, and great direction. This film is an underseen movie. This is a great movie and I highly reccomend it."
1,"God, this movie blows","The only redeaming quality of this movie is knowing that it will eventually end. I guess if you count the dialog, which ends up being quite funny, you've got an average bad movie. I dig the bear, but I can't help but think of the conversation between Hopkins and Baldwin before the filming of the movie that probably ended with a, ""you want to go to Alaska for free and stay at a lodge with Elle MacPhearson and get paid?"" Just a bad movie, pure and simple. Good scenery shots, but that's not hard. Down two thumbs."
1,the edge,"If you're looking for 16x9 widescreen, DONT buy this. Its 2:35 letterbox, meant for standard 4x5 tv. I have tried twice now to order the other wide screen version that says "" widescreen edition"" on the cover and has different artwork. Both times I was sent this aweful letterbox version. So beware...these vendor employees who pack and ship the orders are completely ignorant about film aspect. Good luck getting a true widescreen disc."
4,AN EASY READ - FOR JAMES!,"I have had trouble getting through some of James books -- like The Golden Bowl. But this book is well written in a simple fashion -- that is, for James, and moves along at a quick pace. And things do happen, unlike in some of James books. It is the story of a man obsessed with getting some intimates letters that a famous poet once wrote to a woman whom he loved. He wants these papers so badly, that he finds the now old woman living in Venice and rents rooms in her house. He also meets her niece. Then he begins scheming and planning-- how shall he go about getting these Aspern papers. The question is: does he succeed?"
5,Arrived quickly and price was great!,This dvd set arrived very quickly. It matched its description. Very satisfied with purchase. Great price! Plan to buy more.
1,It no good,Amazon is suppose be returning my money which i have not seen yet the product is no good yes it did remove the mice from in the wall and brought them into the house.
3,Informative but don't like presentation,"The recipes look good and the shows would be helpful for someone learning to cook. However, I find the technique of having a wide-eyed novice as a student VERY distracting.The student will make annoying vocalizations and comments that are all the way through the show. ""Okay."" ""Okay."" ""Yeah."" ""Uhhuh."" ""Okay."" etc. Worse yet, periodically they have interviews with the student(!) This adds absolutely nothing to the value of the show and involves more inane commentary.The recipes are good and there is a lot to learn from the videos. In general, though, I prefer Lidia's Italian cooking shows. Much more calm and no distracting discussions with students. I also like Julia Child and Jacques Pepin's cooking shows. They do have a lot of dialog but it is between two interesting, mature, skilled individuals. America's Test Kitchen also has wonderful cooking videos - one set for each season they've been on the air."
5,I cannot get enough of her show!!!,She's so excellent I can't tell you enough. I watch her shows on PBS and from this DVD set over and over. I just wish she will present more new material in the future. Yay for Joanne Weir!
5,Changing Belief Systems with NLP by Robert Dilts,This book is in perfect condition and arrived well within the timeframe stated. I live in Australia so this was much appreciated.
4,Nick and Nora they're not!,"This is a cute tale of an almost thirty female looking for Mr. Right who she thinks she's mistakenly allowed to escape. She hires David Anderson,Mr. Wrong, a wannabe writer of pulp fiction and underworked private eye to search for her future husband. Together they go on a madcap adventure, capture the bad guys and find true love. On the book jacket they are compared to Dashell Hammet's Nick and Nora. David and Jacey are cute and the dialogue is sometimes amusing, but Nick and Nora they are not. They lack the sophistication and smart repartee of the incomparable Nick and Nora."
2,More than I wanted,"I only wanted the ""Over America"" DVD itself, but ordered this because I did not realize what was included. The set includes:Over America - 116 minutesWashington D.C. - 58 minutesGlobe Trekker: San Francisco - 60 minutesGlobe Trekker - New York - 60 minutes"
3,Decent but...,"...a Compact Ladder would be nice as well. It is noisy when you are pulling it around. I have used it a few times since i purchased and it seems like a decent piece of equipment at first. The transporting of equipment seems cool but the head (the hand truck base) seems to be fragile. The steps are narrow but it's okay to work with.Overall, I should of sticked to purchasing a regular heavy duty step ladder and call it a day. I will continue to use this until their is a surplus in the company."
4,hot wheels redlines,i recieved this book and i was wowed i did not know they made some many redline cars for hotwheels everything was in detail
5,St. Augustine,"Book is marvelous! Great book on the stages & growth of Augustine's thoughts & philosophy. Easy read & one gets a good understanding of Augustine the man, pastor, & mystic!"
3,"Useful as a general reference,","This book is bargain-priced, but there are better ""how to's"" out there for beginners. It is a good reference book for the money, and full of useful general information. As an additional resource for your study, it has something to offer; but it's more of an ""extra""."
4,Good size for storing things in the trunk,Just barely fits my large jumper cables. Seems extremely well made and durable. A 3 three pack with a slightly larger bag would be nice.
1,A lot of lies,"I have been a Seventh-day Adventist for over twenty years and I am appalled that someone would write such a disturbing and foolish book.First, I would like to say that Seventh-day Adventist do NOT believe in righteousness by works. Jesus paid the price for our sins, there is no reason to work for our salvation. It is true that many Adventists may follow a vegetarian diet, may not wear jewelry, etc but that does not mean they think they are working their way into Heaven. All those things are just ways they try to be righteous.Secondly, the church does not think that Ellen White is the final authority on doctrine. She herself said to look to the Bible for the final authority and that she is a ""lesser light"" than the Bible.So, this book does not expose a cult, it exposes that the author is a liar. And 99.999% of Adventist do NOT think they are prophets."
1,A very ignorant author...,"The man who wrote this book has ZERO knowledge of Biblical scripture and makes all kinds of radical claims that can not be ""backed up"" or supported. His book should be the laughing stock of Biblical history. Don't bother with this ""worthless"" book - it's a TOTAL FLEECING of your money!I am very sorry that I wasted my time with this book. I am sure you will be TOO if you buy it!"
1,Very poor research,This author doesn't know who and what the Seventh Day Adventists are. Sorry to disappoint you readers. Rather read E G White's Great Controversy and compare it with history. God bless.
2,Works.... But has some problems,"I recieved this printer about a year ago in a package deal with buying a new computer. All of the functions the printer was designed to do still work, but the printer has a problem where it can't grab the paper out the tray so I get very frequent ""out of paper"" error messages which causes you to have to play around with it to get it to work. After some research and trying other things, it probably needs new pickup rollers. My question is how can the pickup rollers go after only a year of minimal use?"
1,NO GOOD,I bought it most of the time it wants to print in gray scale and checked to see if I had to print in grayscale no that was not the prob. So I contact HP because thought the cartridges were leaking saw ink in the bottom.Decided bad printer took it back got another same model and quess what same thing been my rounds with HP on this and I will be taking this one back also I belive it's a LEMON wouldn't recommond this to know one.I say HP go back and try again
1,OK before the color cartridge problem,This printer works ok before the color cartridge problem. Called customer service at night stupidly. The call was forwarded to another country at no avail. DO NOT BUY IT AND DO NOT CALL THEM. Save your money and time.
5,Romantic Celebration,This CD is a man's journey for love set to an earthy rock & roll rhythm. Farre's very sexy voice enhances the soulful lyrics and rouses you to explore the possibilities of your own heart. Buy a copy and hear for yourself!
4,Handle with care,This toy is great. The bad is that if for some reason an electronic problem happen you are done. In my opinion not for kids. If so I'd say only for someone who is used to treat his stuff with care.
4,Gone to Earth,"An overlooked wonder. The Korean import is perfect. The film looks as good as it did when first released, and this is the origial verson, not the version David O. Selznick cut and butchered. A lovely film."
5,Gone to Earth,Very odd but exquisite movie; unusual and very far-out.Not a movie you would see all the time. I really like it. The main thing is that Jennifer Jones is a very free spirit. She loves animals and that's what's so interesting---it drives her and I understand that.
5,Great Batman Series,"I had heard mixed reviews about this series and the first couple episodes I watched I wasn't in love with. But after you get into it, it's addicting!! Many people might not like how the Joker is portrayed, but he definitely grows on you. Don't pass up this series!"
1,Boooooooo! Zero stars!,"What do you get when you have a studio full of talent that you let leave to go make quality programing on another network, then realize you still want to make low quality cartoons using those same licenced characters?Give up?Okay, what do you get when a corporate focus group with no understanding of anything get together and try to figure out how something sucessful and wonderful ticks but fail at every attempt?That's right! THE BATMAN!My question is how could ANYONE who says they love Batman work on that show and make the Joker a barefoot rasta-head and just when we thought Danny DeVitto's memory sank to the bottom of a watery grave, they had to go ahead and drudge up that awful cinematic design.thanks Warner Brothers. Thanks for wrecking everything I love."
5,Great series,The artwork and the stories are fantastic. It's a great new take on the Batman story. Everyone will enjoy the series.
4,a unique steadily getting better batman,I have been a batman fan since i could speak it was the first word i said. when warner bros. was making this cartoon i was excited although initially it is very weak and doesn't have very much substance it progresses nicely. the animation aspect is flawless it is very unique and interesting to look at.It develops nicely towrds the last five episodes and take what made Batman:The Animated Series great (which was the writing) and makes it work in their version. Bottomline weak at the beginning great at the end and season two is even better.
1,What they did not learn from Batman & Robin,"When I first saw previews of this cartoon, I thought to myself another new interpetation of Batman. Another chance to redeem that farce that George Clooney & Joel Schumacher created. Boy how wrong I was. It's not so much the new take on Dark Knight and his colorful rogues gallery but it's just bad the job they did. Batman : the animated series set the bar. These folks decided to go below the bar and start digging a hole about six feet deep.Does any any of the people who made this have kids? I mean c'mon. Talk about cruel and unusual punishment. I have been a comic book fan all my life life, and I intend to be one till I die. However if they keep making crap like this, I just might have to stamp collecting."
3,Seeing into the future...,"I don't understand how another reviewer kept complaining about this DVD (her son being upset, deciding to just use it as a coaster, etc...) - it's not out until later this month. I suppose she was anticipating how she'd feel when she bought this based on the show that's being aired currently. Of course, that begs the question, why buy the DVD if you hate the show currently being aired so much? Regardless, I'm a big fan of the classic BTAS and can still enjoy this new Batman show - much of the animation is truly stunning and I like the different take on Batman, even if it's not my favorite."
2,Not as good as the 1990's series,"No cartoon will ever come close to the Batman 1990's series (this is coming from a fan of Spider-Man and the X-Men). That cartoon had many adult themes and excellent plots. This cartoon, like many other remakes, was dumbed down for Generation Y. Instead of the complicated machinations that were present in the 1990's series, every episode consists of Batman stopping a villain from his lame, predictable scheme. Even the intro theme song sucks. However, there are some watchable episodes in this series (especially in the later seasons). I liked the Batman-Superman team up (when all else fails, that's a good way to get ratings). In conclusion, this is not the worst cartoon ever, but the 1990's series puts this to shame. And why does the Joker look like Bob Marley?"
4,The Batman,Great series. Season 1 is a good start. Still like the animated series that Paul dini and Bruce Timm did but it is right up there.
4,Buy for yourself. Not a gift.,"I think it is a great product. It does need to increase the range of the sensor, because you need to be practically right on something for it to go off -- but for under $40, it is very helpful. I bought this for my inlaws and they got so offended it started a fight during the holidays that we have still yet to resolve 3 months later. I mean, I still think they did need this, but they did not take well to the gift and according to other family members, it was a poor choice on my part."
1,"Technical Analysis 001, Perhaps!","Don't waste your money ! Between the people walking in front of the camera, the interuptions from the audience with questions you can not hear, and the instrutor looking at his watch making comments that he doesn't have the time to cover everything, the instructor Mark Seleznov barely touches on Volume or Moving Averages and never covers Relative Srength as stated in the description of the video !"
4,How to understand human failure,"Although the words are not used, this is a book about the failure of complex adaptive systems, especially those systems with humans involved. Dorner decomposes several major failures including Chernobyl, and simulations of farmland in Africa, factory towns, and ecological scenarios. He outlines the failure of people to think at the systems level, tending only to deal with the problems in front of them. People act without analysis of the whole situation."
3,"Good analysis, but way to long winded",This book layed out some good work on determining common errors when confronted with a complex problem. However I thought the book could have been condensed into just a few chapters while still presenting much of the same informaion.
2,Boring,"This book is pretty much a textbook, I thought there would be case studies but it mostly revolves around computer simulations that Dorner ran, really slow and boring and tough to find the application to real situations."
4,A deeper look into why things fail big-time.,"This book gives a penetrating look into why things fail big. It also raises the ""Ah-ha!"" factor - when people see the underlying but logical causes of failures, they say, ""Ah-ha!"". ANYBODY could have seen that ... but, of course, didn't. It's a little like the invention of the paper-clip or safety pin. Obvious, but only after-the-fact. In this book, the author goes before-the-fact. This is a thoughtful, interesting book and a somewhat challenging read.SERRandolph,NJ"
4,A Must Read for the Serious Investigator,"Dorner provides great insights into why we humans are not as smart as we think we are. He shows how our slowness in thinking, our inability to process large amounts of information at any one time, our arrogance, and short sightedness all contribute to ineffective problem solving. While he attempts to provide ways to avoid these stumbling blocks, he falls short on this mission. A much better read for how to avoid these pitfalls can be found in Apollo Root Cause Analysis."
4,Good movie,"Very informative. The only thing that would have been better was if it were in English instead of french, but I understand why it was. Reading the captions got kind of old, but I got used to it after a while. All in all, it was a fairly good DVD."
5,What a great way to spend 2 hours.,"If you enjoy cycling, check this out. It's a great insight into one team's struggle in the Tour of 2003. Very high quality video."
4,Vibration Spectrum Analysis : A Practical Approach,A practical book like this helps people a lot in doing vibration measurement. I think the author made effort to connect theoretical and practical issues for reader to understand what is expected to be measured in doing experiments.
5,Clears the jam; same as an allen wrench...,"I found out about this tool when shopping for a new disposal. I knew it was simply an allen wrench, so I searched online to find what size would work. I couldn't find the info anywhere, so I'm posting it here.This is the same as a 1/4"" allen wrench.If you already have allen wrenches, no need to buy this one. If you don't, spend the six bucks on a nice balldriver allen wrench set that you can use for other jobs."
1,Lumbar support,"Mine is already ripped, there is almost no lumbar support and the bands that are supposed to keep it in position are all broken!!Its useless"
4,great seat cover,"the product came as described, i was scare that it will be a different color because it didn't say on the order but all turned out great. the cover fits my 2002 tacoma and the padding is just right. thanx again,amazon."
2,Less than expected,"I was an avid fan of Carr's Alienist and Angel of Darkness. This novel pales in comparison. Rather than equaling the efforts of Doyle, it leads the reader to an anticlimactic conclusion. I would like to see Carr return to the venue of the aforementioned works."
1,Pass This One By,"'The Italian Secretary' is the latest big-name pastiche in the world of Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, it is not very good.Carr's writing style is ponderous and his sentences and paragraphs are wordy. This tale originally started out as a short story for inclusion in 'Ghosts in Baker Street' and the author turned into a seperate novel.It was a poor decision. There is barely enough substance to make a novella, and it certainly is thin for a novel. The plot is rather simple, with Holmes' belief in ghosts flying in the face of the original Doyle character. There is nothing about this book that makes it stand out from the glut of Holmes tales on the market.There are much better pastiches out there, such as books by Richard Boyer, Larry Millett and Frank Thomas. I doubt I will ever take this one off the bookshelf again."
2,Where is the Carr that I love?,"I loved the Alienist and Angel of Darkness. I love novelsabout Sherlock Holmes e.g. The Beekeeper's Apprentice. ButCarr managed to disappoint me on two levels. While this wasa novel about Sherlock Holmes, it was so boring to me. I lookedforward to getting this book (after not even being able to finishKilling Time). I thought he might be on track again. This booksucked! I can't even believe I finished it. Please, Mr. Carr,get back to your awesome series...The Alienist. I want thosecharacters back!"
2,Memo to Mr. Carr (author),The supernatural and Sherlock do not mix well.I do not recommend this item. Check it out at a library and read a bit first before buying if possible.
1,too elementrary,"carr ain't no doyle, is about all you need to know about this book. the basic 'scheme' of the book is childish, and the outcome is quite stupid. it is really quite outlandish to find out that no one is actually threatening the royal family, but rather ... oh well, you read it if you want, but it is not worth the time or money.however, it is well written in the doyle style and could have been so much better. it is like that twit who wrote 'scarlet', the sequel to 'gone with the wind': she really wasn't up to it either.i suspect they will get that tall idiot from 'friends', schwimer or what ever, to play holmes in this 'thriller' and maybe jim belushi for watson. dgs"
3,Very big(((,"Ordered this boots for women's size 8,5 in size 6. They are huge. But the main problem is that they are heavy and not comfortable. ((("
3,"filler, and just that","This book was ok - it expanded a bit on the events before the Thrawn trilogy, and was able to tie in the characters from the horrid prequels. As a fan of the Star Wars books, it leave a lot to be desired. The story of retrieving a lost piece of art - which tritely happens to have a secret code in it - leads the Solo family to Tatooine, and then, senselessly all over the planet. We spend a quarter of the book wandering helplessly through the deserts of Tatooine, which as a plot device is about exciting as cataloging the flaura and fauna of a desert.One thing I have heard from more than one source, is that people like this book, because its release was in the middle of the New Jedi Order series, and was sort of a break from that saga.If you are bound and determined to complete the whole series of Star Wars books (like me), pick it up and read it. If not, you should just stick to the Thrawn Trilogy."
5,Troy Denning has written a great book here,"I have to say that this book is preety good its feel good charm is a nice break from the dark world that ""The New Jedi Order"" books have become. In this installment you basically have Leia trying to come to grips with the fact that while her father became a killing machine he was still a child at one point. This is also interesting because we get to meet pepole in this book that we last saw as kids 35 years ago.As for the book itself it is fairly action packed and has a good plot. Realistically this book only gets 4 stars from me. However there is one important addition to this book that has ben missing from star wars for almost 5 years.CHEWIE IS BACK!! Thats right my favorite charecter is back for one shining moment and that alone makes up for any other problems I have with this book.Overall-Preety good book, very interesting revalations that open new possibilities for other books."
3,From reason to chaos,"In this short summary of other works a picture of chaos and its short term cure is shown, however, in Irving's earlier works we see a picture of a man trying to advance a science. Many experts follow in Irving's footsteps from reason to chaos in pursuit of lost monetary interests."
4,good basic study,Did this with my small group of Bible study ladies. It was harder for those that had no Bible background so the leader would need to fill in with some historical and culture history to better understand the setting and what is happening. But I really liked the questions and it resulted in good discussions.
5,Closest yet to perfection,"No hesitation in granting this CD 5 stars. If your all-time list includes Pet Sounds, Automatic For The People, The Joshua Tree and Rubber Soul, add this title right now. I bought in on the day of it's release, on a sunny day in Scotland. Over a year on, and the music sounds as innovative and fresh as it did on the first listen. I cannot fault it. If you are new to Radiohead, try The Bends first. If you are more adventurous, however, jump right in: the result is very rewarding."
5,yep its great,"Well i've owned it since 1997 when it was released but have never written a review of it, but even all this time later this album still amazes me every time i listen to it. Like many people say, it will take many listens before you appreciate its genius but once you do you'll love it forever. Highlights for me are Electioneering and Climbing up the Walls, and The Tourist, which is without a doubt the best closing song on any album (even more than Street Spirit). Praise indeed."
3,Good to have. But not much new.,"This is a great product. The price wasn't that high (I got it for about $23 bucks). But I am a die-hard Radiohead fan, so I have heard all of the stuff already. It's just good to have it in a nice package. I DO love the DVD, but I wish it was longer. Good live stuff I've never seen before, plus it's nice to have a good quality DVD version of their videos from OK Computer. All in all, it's a good package. Someone who has never heard the ""bonus songs"" CD will absolutely LOVE it."
2,Not worth the hype in my opinion,"I got this cd after hearing how it was possibly the greatest cd of all time from shows like Vh1 ""The List"" and other places. Don't believe it, unless you really enjoy radiohead. I do not particularly enjoy this cd or their other cd that has been big titled ""The Bends."" I do feel there are some good songs on the cd like ""No Surprises,"" and ""Karma Polica"" and ""Parnoid Android."" (I do feel that karma police and paranoid android are two of the most brilliant songs of the 90's and that is why this cd receives two stars) Other than these three songs, I would not recommend this cd, and would recommend downloading the three mentioned songs."
2,"About 4 and a half good songs, a lot of filler.","I guess I just don't ""get it"". OK Computer is NOT the greatest album of the 90s. ""Exit Music"", ""Karma Police"", ""Electioneering"", ""No Surprises"", and maybe even ""Paranoid Android"" are fairly alright songs...but they are not the be-all-end-all of modern day rock music. I usually find myself skipping over most of the tracks on this album...just too dull for my tastes. In all honesty, I find Pablo Honey to be a more fulfilling listen than OK Computer. Sorry, RH fans, but I like to enjoy my music, not fall asleep to it."
2,Ok Radiohead,"Well, here it is, the most overated album of the 90s, along with that godawful Mellon Collie thing by the Smashing Pumpkins. I have no doubt the same people who [dote] over this boring overproduced [stuff] also think Billy Corgan is a musical genius. So about OK computer, i'll say that it's not nearly as bad as Kid a. This album though is all about the production. The music wouldn't sound anywhere near as good if it wasn't for all the sonic tweaking and other studio tricks. Underneath it all the music is cold, boring and lacks identity. It sounds like they're trying to be the Pink Floyd of the 90s. Granted, some of the songs deserve merit, mainly tracks 4, 5 and 6. But the first 3 songs are so boring, i really struggled to get through them to find something worth listening to. I don't know what the concept of Ok Computer is suppose to be, but if it was for Thom Yorke to sing and write songs like a computer then he sure did succeed."
1,still just not getting it,"You know.....i think it is all just hype.I have listened to this at least half a dozen times and there is nothing here. The brief moments when i wasn't thoroughly bored was merely because i was completely annoyed. What's with this guy's incoherent mumbling. What's with the general fuzziness of the music. I just don't get it.Save your money and check e-bay, people are unloading these cheap."
5,I'm another one complaining about MTV supporter,"Okay this album makes you think. Sort of. I often find myself thinking about this album when I'm not listening to it trying to figure out some lyric that Yorke blurted out on one of these songs.I don't know why I just said that, but I did.Classic album, I don't really know what else to say.Now, Dear MTV Supporter-I'm glad you think a song can only be as good as the chorus. If you knew you wouldn't like this album before you bought it (or whatever you did), then why did you 'waste your time' listening to it? Yes, I read your other reviews and I can understand why you don't like Radiohead (He's a Good Charlotte, 50 Cent fan folks!). so maybe I just don't understand or something but it just doesn't make sense why ""The Young and the Hopeless"", and ""Get Rich of Die Trying"" got 5 stars, and not Ok Computer. Oh wait, I guess I do understand. It's because those songs have ""catchy chourses""."
5,The soundtrack to everything,"This is by far the best Radiohead CD I've heard and I am a fan!Ok Computer is like the soundtrack to everything--cross country car trips, books (especially The Phantom Tollbooth), and any number of weird internationa movies. Every single track is great and the whole CD has a definite mood. It is different from The Bends album but fans will see a progression from one to the other. I highly recommend it."
1,Holy crap!,This is one of the worst records ever by one of the worst bands ever. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Just buy Synchronicity by the Police or Listen Like Thieves by INXS. Both bands and both albums are only about 300 times better than this crap.
3,"Radiohead ""OK Computer""","Radiohead, to me, are the mediocre mix of Porcupine Tree and Pink Floyd. That being said, I can't give OK Computer any higher than 3 stars, and that may be a generous score. It's not as innovative as Pablo Honey, not as good as The Bends, not as weak as Kid A, and not as stupid as Amnesiac. That basically puts it in the middle of their discography. At times the vocals closely resemble that of Porcupine Tree's musical/vocal giant, Steven Wilson. I might suggest to Radiohead that they drop the ever ongoing technology push, and just go back to making good ambient rock.Standout Tracks: Lucky, Karma Police, Airbag, Climbing Up The Walls"
5,:),"I hope the last review was a joke.This album is a beautiful departure. Unlike the subsequent albums, this doesn't feel like ""music to kill yourself to"".This was the last radiohead album I bought; and after listening to Kid A, Amnesiac and Hail To the thief... I can see why. Those albums do have a few good songs on them, but not enough to warrant my praises (unless I'm one of those people obsessed with pro-tools and minimal instrumentation.)Listen to the rest of Radiohead's albums first, but definitely buy 'Ok Computer', 'The Bends', and 'Pablo Honey' with blind faith."
5,Exhilarating,"I won't attempt to put here a descriptive review of the content of this album; I'll plainly state my impressions upon hearing OK Computer. This album evokes by itself, in different times of your life, a complete spectrum of emotions and visions. It identifies you with torturous melodies, wondrous lyrics, hopeful riffs and penetrating resonance. It will give you that joyful sorrow or a sorrowful joy to keep wandering about one more day in this strange planet of ours."
3,half great - half dull,"It's late, I'm tired and not capable of writing a big review....but suffice it to say that a) I think this is an album people should buy and b) I say that for the first 6 songs which to me are incredible.....what happened to the second half of the record????"
2,Songs are not too exciting.,1 or 2 good songs on this cd. most of them are pretty much the same and if you're into fast types of music you will not like this cd.
5,Well worth the wait,"After all these years, I FINALLY got around to OK Computer. Radiohead never seemed like my thing, but the acclaim for this cd is so overwhelming, that I had to investigate. Overall, I like the cd more than I expected after one listen. The robotic theme kind of put me off at first, but I liked it. As with most good cds, every few listens resulted in my liking more and more of what I heard. My favorite songs are: Paranoid Android, No Surprises, Subterranean Homesick Alien and Karma Police, in that order. Paranoid Android seamlessly blends two totally different types of music together and amazes me every time I listen to it. No suprises is a simple lullaby-like song that is beautiful. I'm very glad I finally bought this disc and I now see what all the hype was about. I especially enjoy this music on rainy days or in the evening before the sun sets. The whole disc flows nicely and it causes me to be reflective. If you're an open minded listener, I highly recommend this cd."
5,Brilliant,I never thought I'd say Radiohead was brilliant... that was until I was given this CD... I think I must have listened to it every day for months until I finally got The Bends which in my book is one of the best purchases ever made.
1,It seems 5% of people dont get it,"It seems 5% of people dont get it. Reading the 1 star reviews is quite fun but they dont get it. I think what OK computer did was took a conceptual non popular style to the masses, and people liked it. Good on emI'm sure it's not as conceptual as some music, and I'm sure that music is far less popular.Comparisons to floyd? Well i'm sure in the 70's their music was considered conceptual, but I'm also also sure they weren't the most conceptual around. Pink Flyods a great band, so are Radiohead. They both took a conceptual sound and made it pop."
2,"Yawn, Yawn, Yawn","This band is nothing but hype. All of their songs are boring and this album is no different. For some reason a lot of guys buy it thinking it will somehow make them appear to be a little more intelligent than they really are and know a little more about music than they really do. In reality, it just proves that they are insecure and bought into the hype.While it is obvious a lot of time and money went into the making of OK Computer, music was not meant to be formulated this way. There is no substitute for raw talent, no matter how much time you spend on producing the album. This is the Backstreet Boyz and N'Sync without the dance tunes. It's factory-produced commercialism, believed by the music industry to be an instant money-maker so they gave it their stamp of approval and sent it on its way.Music is supposed to engage you, it's supposed to evoke emotion and pleasure. OK Computer is as bland as a blank computer screen."
5,I Am Starting To See The Brilliance In Radiohead,"At first, all I heard was excellent musicianship...most people would be content with that. However, after much contemplation, I have begun to UNDERSTAND Radiohead's message.A PIG IN A CAGE ON ANTOBIOTICSIf you truly understand that, you will be on your way to solving our world..."
3,OK Cd,"it's a good cd..i picked up on radiohead after their release of ok computer, and it started with an older song of theirs. i like their live stuff better..(eg no alarms the older version). it is not recommended to people that listen to music for..i suppose entertainment would be a good word. if you're fighting depression you might find some familliar things in there..i really didn't think it was shallow..it's good and not really supposed to fit everybody's tase. and also i really must be an ignorant because i didn't even hear of a hype about this cd."
5,One of the best albums ever made,"Deserted on an island and you can only bring one album. This one would be a good choice. This is the album that set Radiohead in the spotlight, and also gave them the cash to sit back and do what they wanted to do...Kid A namely. Haven't seen this kind of album since Pink Floyd. The whole disc is a journey, really."
5,it was my first Radiohead album,"Back in 1997, my little cousin wanted me to discover a new group ""as big as the Beatle"" he said. When I saw ""Karma police"" on the album I turned to him and said ""I know them"" the had a big sucess with the song ""Creep"" a while back and they have a couple of good songs from this album on radio.Knowing at least four songs on this album, my first listening was focused on stuff I did not know. I immediately got interested in song ""Climbing up the walls"" and I think it is my all time favorite Radiohead song (a bit scary and cacaphonic).To date OK Computer is still my favorite Radiohead album."
5,Completely wonderful,"This album is truly amazing. For one thing, it contains my favorite song, ""exit music (for a film),"" but the rest of the album is also spectacular. Sure, I liked Pablo Honey, with its pop-like stuff, and I loved The Bends, with its amazing but not clichéd force that I never really got tired of, but this even rises above that. It's like a ""normal"" mix of pop and all-out rock music but with such marvelous songs that they don't need to go fast. This, to me, is amazing."
5,WORK OF GENIUS,"This is a masterpiece, from start to finish.It is deep, depressing and slow, and yet soft as a feather, and considering ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" alone, it is fair to say: this is the work of a genius. (Most of the other tracks are also truly great, especially, in my opinion, ""Lucky"" and ""Karma Police"").But I should warn you: it took me a few ""listens"" to really get into this album. Because it's so different (I mean original) and groundbreaking, you'll have to be patient. Listen to it three or four times and I garantee it will get to you. Don't just ""dump it"" after your first ""contact"" with it. ENJOY IT!"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST RECORDS EVER!,"I feel bad for anyone who gave this record anything less than five stars, I would hate to experience music through your ears and mind. In fact, this cd should have the exception of being able to rate it at 10 stars, and no other options. It simply is just that good. Radiohead and OK Computer single handedly made me lose interest in metal for a couple of years, but, that was like taking CRACK away from a junkie, and I am full blown back into metal again. AMEN!"
5,Listen Closely And Loudly,"Easily one of the most transcendant headphone albums ever created. You can hear just how much love, labor and care went into the making of this masterpiece as the beautiful noise washes over you. Such wonderful sounds...like Heaven on Earth.I can't recommend this album highly enough."
5,Greatest Band of all time's Greatest album ever...,"So then technically its the best album ever correct?I guess so. Better than ""pet sounds"" ""Daydream Nation"" ""Loveless"" and ""London Calling...""I can't believe people cannot like this album... It makes me angry, sad, and confused..."
5,Just here to boost the overall rating.,"I don't need to go into detail, I mean read some of the reviews that do. This album is the best from the 1990s and better than anything from the 80s or first half of this decade too. It's simply unbelievably good.Oh, and everyone buy Joy Division records."
3,"""Kid A"": way more interesting.","It may not as frequently reach the critic's lists as ""OK Computer"" but upon repeated listens to both albums, there is a much more richly detailed sonic tapestry at work on ""Kid A"" than ""OK Computer."" So, as to a rating of ""OK Computer,"" when comparing to ""Kid A,"" I'd say it's just OK (or three stars). Had I not heard ""Kid A,"" I'd bump it up to 4 or 5 stars depending on my mood."
1,Thom Yorke Michael Stipe-What's the difference?,"If you're the type of person that ejacualtes over unoriginal, mellowdramatic, lackluster ""music"" , OK Computer is for you... but if you're the type of person that scoffs at the whole ""troubled thoughts concerning the rich, angry lead vocalist vibe"", then you will think this album wanks it."
5,the greatest ever,"This album is perhaps the greatest studio album that I have ever heard. Radiohead is today the most creative and amazing rock band going. Their ability to do just about anything stifles me. I have spent long hours debating this topic with friends, most of whom had no interest in Radiohead before I played this album for them, now most of them swear by it. I challenge anybody to find a more creative and captivating album ever."
3,Not the flash of brilliance it's been touted as!!,"Having heard such glowing praise as ""Pink Floyd for the nineties"" and ""brilliant,"" I felt the urge to pick up my first album from a band I only knew from their single ""Creep."" The result: a rather annoying disappointment. On the whole ""OK Computer"" is a pretty good album, but it defnitely has its flaws. For one thing, the majority of the tracks are indistinguishable from each other. Not in the seamless way of a Pink Floyd album, but in the way of an album conceptualized by someone with a severely limited imagination. Who in good conscience coud really call ""Paranoid Android"" a good song? A few days ago I bought ""Pablo Honey,"" a far superior album. Everything that's wrong with ""OK Computer"" is right with this album. Nothing meanders, everything has a point, and each track is easily distinguished from the last. So a nice try, and an enjoyable listen, but not the brilliant masterpiece it's been touted as.Chris N. Southfield, Michigan"
3,"Pretty Good, But Overrated","The details of this album have been debated ad nauseum, so I won't go over that. I'm just going to offer my basic opinion. After my brother strongly recommending this CD to me, I bought it. I have listened to it in my car for many months and have withheld judgment until now.I give the music 4 stars and Yorke's singing 1.5 stars. Honestly, his high, grating, non-musical voice took a while to stand long enough to give the music a chance. Compared to Yorke, Robert Plant is Pavarotti. Having said that, after my distaste for Yorke's ""singing"" waned I was able to enjoy the music. I don't find it to be as revolutionary and genius as Pink Floyd, but it is fairly substantive.Usually I can learn to tolerate and even like what is technically poor singing, and to some degree that has occurred with Yorke, but in the end I've had extreme difficulty ""getting over"" his sound."
5,"Ok, just one thing","I have already reviewed this album. I have have just one request. Please, no one, ever again, ever, bring up Dark Side of the Moon in a review of OK Computer again, either to ridicule OKC as pathetic compared to DSotM, or to call it a ripoff/wannabe/whatever, or to pronounce it better, or whatever. Really, they're not similar, and you're insulting both Pink Floyd, who are an awesome band, and Radiohead, who are also an awesome band.Thanks."
1,I don't get it,"I bought this cd about 5 years ago and played it about 20 times. I NEVER get the urge to put this in my cd player. The music is simple and the lyrics are very abstract. I guess it's artsy-fartsy music that I'll never understand.However I do enjoy music by The Grateful Dead, Santana, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, The Band, Bob Dylan, Hot Tuna, Jefferson Airplane, T-Bone Walker, John Coletrane, Ornette Coleman...Oh well... times are changing."
4,Old school British Metal,"I have re-discovered SAXON in my late 30s. I was into Metal back in the 80s and these guys always flew under the radar. 10 songs are all solid, just wish the cd was longer and offered a re-mastered version. Great taste of Saxon and a good starting album."
1,No leaks? Yeah right!,It'd be one thing if this product leaked a little here and there. NO! Every nuby product I've purchased or was given to me as a gift - including this one - leaked ALL the contents anytime it was on it's side.It soaked my carpets and spilled all over our tile.I wouldn't recommend ANY nuby product to anyone.
2,if you like rodeo,If your crave rodeos you might take a seat in the stands for this one. Otherwise there aint that much to it!
3,Nailbomb - 'Point Blank' (Roadrunner),"'Point Blank' is the first of two releases by this short-lived band.Nailbomb was a side project of Fudge Tunnel's Alex Newport and Sepultura's Max Cavalera.Boy,is this CD H-E-A-V-Y!!Maybe too heavy for it's own good.It's decent,though.Good industrial metal to take in,that is if you're willing.All thirteen cuts kick ass,like ""Wasting Away"",""24 Hour Bullsh*t"",""Cockroaches"" and ""Sick Life"" especially.Just might appeal to some fans of Godflesh,Corrosion Of Conformity,Ministry and Napalm Death."
5,Most updated source I've found,"This book hit the nail on the head for me. A good, easy to understand guide to all kinds of computer hardware. I particularly found the author's treatment of PDAs, digital cameras, and mobile computing devices very useful. Most other books on computer hardware only cover PCs. This book covers PCs and nearly every kind of computing device on the market. I give the author two thumbs for covering more than PCs."
1,Epi Book,This book is relatively basic. The main issue why I don't like it is that the preview showed the corrected third edition in the info page but the textbook I was sent is the original printing which has errors throughout the text due to a publisher's problem.
4,Their Finest Hour.,"MACHINE HEAD - Burn My Eyes-I put this album in my CD player a few days ago and I forgot how much I loved this album. It was Heavy Metal, plain and simple. This has: Great guitar work, (with solos) thumping bass, amazing drums and a great metal vocalist to top it off. Burn my Eyes was the beginning of the end for Machine Head as they ever so slowly jumped on the new metal band-wagon. However this album shines as one of my favorite metal albums of the 90's. I only wish they could have kept there metal-roots and focus. Their follow-up ""The More Things Change"" is quite good as well but Burn my Eyes is, by far, their finest release.Favorite Tracks: Davidian, Old, A Nation of Fire, Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies-4 StarsIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
5,THE best Machine Head album! EVER!,"I love this album by Machine Head, my all time number one favourite band! Although I love all of their albums (yes, that's including 'Burning Red' & 'Supercharger'!), this is without a shadow of a doubt the band's best! And you can hear why!They're all great, 'Davidian', 'Old', 'Blood for Blood', 'Nation on Fire', 'Block', 'Thousand Lies', 'Death Church'. All eleven of these songs you'll hear on the album are instant classics and have a very good tendency to stick in your head!I highly recommend, you should own 'Burn My Eyes'!!!"

4,A good extra,I enjoyed this Anime very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
3,Not quite where Nite Life left off,Nite Life was a gem when I bought it. Even finding some Peace Div tracks on other artists compilations made me a complete convert. I certainly had high expectations for Low Pressings - when listening to the first few tracks it felt like listening to Nocturnal Frequencies 3 (Danny Howells) or Nubreed (Satoshi Tomeii) - heard that done that .......But it started lifting from track 8 (Tribal Phunk) with it getting to wicked levels track 10 (Mon Cong) and 11 (Détente). Overall its good & I'm giving it 3 stars. Note - these are old tracks being remixed.
2,Not for Barbie...,"Since Joanne's completely neglected to include the size of the furniture in the item description, I called the toll-free # on their website to verify it. The representative informed me (erroneously) that this set would accomadate 11"" dolls; in fact, it is miniature. Also, if you're getting this item, be prepared to spend at least a few hours assembling it."
2,Doesn't come with instructions!,"I ordered this for my daughter. The product comes nice enough, and clear as day on the cover it says it includes easy to follow instructions. We opened it up to discover no instructions. I contacted the seller and they sent us a replacement quickly, without issues. The second one they sent also did not have any instructions. I guess if I could figure out how all the pieces fit together, I would have two furniture sets for the price of one!"
2,Shape Sorter is too Soft...Confuses My Child!,"My husband and I are very into educational toys and so we bought this shape sorter for our son's first birthday...the shapes are fun especially the clear shapes that contain miniature shapes that are consistent with the piece's shape. The problem is that the walls of the toy are too soft and my son can fit any of the pieces into any of the openings. I am always playing with him so I can redirect him to the correct opening for lets say the square but we want to encourage independent thinking and well...the shape sorter doesn't have the firmness that will deter mistakes! He may be thinking is if the square fits into the circle opening why is Mom shaking her head ""NO!"" My son is getting confused with this toy...and to make matters worse we paid $30 dollars for this toy! Can I have my money back?"
3,"Interesting, violent cult hit","I suppose the most gratifying thing about ""I Drink Your Blood"" is that the characters don't invariably act stupid. For example, when some drifter hippies rape a girl and then give her grandfather acid, a young boy gets revenge on the hippies by feeding them meat pies laced with rabies. This kid is proactive! The movie is still gruesome today, although it seems clear that it would now fit into the R-rated category without much controversy. While the DVD transfer isn't the best, it's hard to go wrong at the price of $8.99."
1,Worst film of Cronenberg's career,"I was looking forward to this film, because of the respect I have for Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender. But this is a by-the-numbers, simplistic, and rather dreadful film. Kiera Knightley's performance is laughably bad...about the level of a Saturday Night Live character. Watching her jut her chin out and bug out her eyes in the first ten minutes made me dread buying this dvd. There's a reason it wasn't in the theaters long...it's awful. One star."
1,horrible,"This movie should have been good because there were some really great actors in it like Keira Knightly and Michael Fassbender but it was just slow, overacted in some parts, underacted in others, and weak with the point. If you are a Fassbender fan watch Shame instead and if you are a Knightly fan watch anything she did before this movie."
2,Disappointing,"I could not wait for this movie to open. It sounded so good, with an excellent cast.But it turned out to be more boring than anything else. And Keira Knightley, whomI usually like, just went over the top acting crazy in the beginning. It was hard to believesuch an apparent nut case could turn out to be the professional she is later in the movie."
1,Keira Knightly Cannot Act,"I was very interested in watching this movie but had to turn it off after the first 20 minutes or so due to the horrendous job of acting on the part of Keira Knightly. Her attempt to portray a psychologically damaged patient in a mental hospital was amateurish at best. It was like watching a bad high school stage production in which the immature actress completely overacts. What was so hard to watch was that she was so obviously acting - you try as a film viewer to suspend belief and get absorbed in the roles of the film. However, when the acting is so bad all you see is someone pathetically attempting to act and nothing more. My wife and I kept on looking at each other and shaking our heads before we finally threw in the white towel of surrender in order to spare us another minute of experiencing an actress way over her head and unable to bring the least bit of subtlety to what could have been an interesting film."
1,a dangerous method,"I expected more from this movie. I'd love to see interplay between Dr.Freud and Dr. Jung, but I was disappointed. I put Dr. Jung on a pedestal as a model of spirituality because of his devotion to helping the first alcoholics receive information about their illness. Dr. Jung is quoted in the Big Book of Alcoholic Anonymous -- the medical knowledge. Dr. Freud - well he abused cocaine probably distorted his view of spirituality. I would like to see something between these two great men again in the future."
2,DULL,"I wantd this to be better, the cast was amazing...and yet such an interesting subject was presented in such a boring way, it felt like a T.V. movie. Very uninspired and overall a shame. The few scenes where there was actual sex involved were far and few, and felt staged. Not much more to say other than its renter at best. Again, I love all three actors...but they were given nothing to do."
5,How the body works,Excellent book for any age above 7 years old. Even adults will have a better understanding of how the body works by reading this well written and beutifully illustrated book.
3,Cool Music But Not the Best,"If you want real death metal, buy Venom. This is good stuff, but it wont be around in ten years. A good value for the money, though."
1,Icky,"this is horrible! My friend suggested I listin to them and I wanted to beat him with a bat. This crap killed the part of my brain that loves music. The vocals sound like somone beating two cats together. The band seems to think they are too good for tempo. It seems like every instrument is off playing at whatever speed the person playin it wants too. It doesn't fit together very well.If you want to listin to some good metal I suggest Opeth, Dragonlord, Testament, Amon Amarth, or Immortal. Really anything is better then this. There is much better music out there. Don't waste your time with this ""satanic"" garbage"
2,"Eh... I've heard worse, and much better","Boring thrash riffs, repetitive and unimaginative drumming, stoopid lyrics and one of the most average vocalists in death metal. Legion is a flat unchanging drone from beginning to end, not unlike listening to a vacuum cleaner that occasionally changes from high to low. The guitar sound is an unimpressive weak buzzing, like radio static, heavy it's not. Back in the day this album was impressive, but listening to it (again) today I find there's really not a whole lot to Legion other than the speed. It doesn't hold up. I never really ""got"" Deicide anyway. Their music never propelled or moved me, unlike Morbid Angel or Death or many other American extreme metal bands of the early 90's. Ultimately Legion and Deicide aren't that interesting to me musically and the poorly concieved fascination with Satan comes across as cheesy. I'm afraid Legion is an unimaginative album from an average band."
3,BURNIN RUBBER,"I DIDN' REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE SEEMS LIKE ALL THER WAS TO IT WAS WHEELIE RIDING. SO UNLESS YOU LIKE TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE RIDING ON THEIR BACK TIRES, THAN THIS IS FOR YOU."
3,"Boys love it, at first","My 3 and 5 year old fight over this new bike that we've had about a month. Seems well built and looks nice too. Only trouble was the innertube needed replacing right away. I think we had a returned box as it looked like it had been opened. But we replaced the tire and good to go!Update a few months later. The excitement was short lived. Neither has ridden the bike in MONTHS. When I mention the bike, they shrug and play with other toys. I wish I could get them excited in this bike again. Probably sell it on Craigslist soon and hope another kids enjoys it more."
5,Schwinn is quality,This roadster is quality built without the plastic of other brands which cost as much and more. A real value and it goes like the wind!
5,Amazing bike!,"This bike is wonderful! It is really easy to put together, is packaged fantastically (each piece individually wrapped to ensure no scratches, dents, or dings during shipping), super easy to put together, and the design is great. I really love that the base is wider than most bikes for more stability and that the seat sits lower than other bikes. We got the pink and it is absolutely adorable. It was a little more than I wanted to spend on a bike, but after receiving it and seeing the quality first hand, I do not regret this purchase one bit. If our next child is a boy, I will not hesitate to purchase another bike in a ""boy color"". If you are even considering this bike, just buy it! You will not be diasappointed!"
5,She just loved it!,"I bought this bicycle in December for my nieces birthday in February. When I finally opened it to put it together I was so pleased!! It came packaged nicely so there was no damage or scrapes to the parts.The quality bicycle was more than I expected for the price I paid.. and when my niece saw it, she just loved it!!"
2,"Three flat tires, 3 missing valve stem caps out of box, and very unpleasant odor.","I read lots of the negative reviews here and hoped my experience would be different. The appearance seems nice so far, but we've yet to try it out. Trike came out of box missing all three valve stem caps and all three tires were completely flat. I am waiting to give this to my son for a Xmas gift so I can't comment yet on its actual performance. I just hope the tires will hold air once I find valve stem cap replacements.The smell of this trike is enough to have made me not buy it. I don't even want to think about what kind of chemicals must have been used on this thing. I had trike in a very large room when I was assembling it and I literally had to open the windows because it smelled up the whole room. The odor in the room remained even days after the trike went into the garage. That can't be healthy.Appearance=good. Smell, three flat tires, missing parts=very bad."
4,"The best tricycle to get, though not perfect.","Putting this tricycle together was easy. Had to buy a bicycle pump to air up the tires more. They haven't gone flat yet though, so i think they were just underinflated for shipping. It is beautiful!!!!! Disappointed in the stickers decorating it when I studied it. Made a perfect product less than in my opinion. However if that is where they were going to cut costs so be it. This tricycle is large for the three and up group (despite what the box mislabels) has a great bell, and steers like a dream. It's inflated rubber tube tires are awesome! and the schwinn body is sturdy and great to look at. The back is very wide, making it near impossible to tip over, and also difficult to get around tight corners. Great bike, just please don't get disappointed by the little imperfections when you get it, it is still a quality product."
4,Nice trike!,"This is a very nice trike and my 2-year-old loves it. It's way less tippy than an old style trike, but it will tip if he corners too fast (he's a wild boy). For less tippy-ness I think you would have to get a big wheel."
5,good deal,"I got this tricyle for my 3 yr. old for Christmas...it was a little big, but he has now grown into it and I would recommend this item. The price easily compares to what you find at Target or Walmart for similar items and, frankly, this one is better all-around than the ones I found at those places. I was looking for a trike that had an old-fashioned 50's look about it and this one fits that description perfectly and is also quite sturdy."
3,Great bike...packed poorly for shipping.,"We shopped around looking for the best bike for our son's 2 year B-Day and settled on this bike because of it's reviews. So far all that was said is true; this bike fits our son well: it does not tip over, it is easy to maneuver, he looks forward to being on his big boy bike everyday. It even fits our 5year old! But with all that being said; for the price that we paid it came to us in pretty bad condition. The frame had a few dings in it that caused paint to come off, the front tire tube had a hole in it and the tire fenders were bent. This all could have been different if the bike had been packaged better. All in all once we fixed the tire, the bike is wonderful, but I am dissapointed in how much it cost for what we got!"
5,Premium Trike,"Both my Grand Son and Grand Daughter got this trike for their 2cd birthday, 1 red, 1 pink. It is very well built with real tires and for the quality it is priced right. And they love the bell on it!"
4,Cute little trike!,My daughter is 21 months old. Legs not quite long enough to pedal but she scoots around on it. Seems well built and will last her a long time since the seat is adjustable.
5,The Harley of Trikes!,We bought this tricycle for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas. It shipped to our house in under a day. Once together we deemed it the Harley of Tricycles. It is awesome. My daughter loves riding it and the trike is extremely durable. It is not the kind you think you are going to have to replace in a year. This thing will be going strong until I run over it with the car in the driveway and even then it may come out on top...
4,Great toddler trike!,"We bought this bike for our 2 year old daughter. She's developmentally delayed and her pedal blocks fit just nicely over the pedals, the seat is supportive it just has a smooth ride. We have a Kettler also and I like this Schwinn much better. Enjoy!"
4,Cool Trike,"Definitely a cool trike. Got it for my son's 2nd birthday and he initially had trouble reaching the pedals (and he's a tall guy - at the 90th percentile for height), but enjoyed pushing it with his feet on the ground. Now that he is three, I've observed that he does have an easier time pedaling other trikes - I'm not sure if it is the air tires or the ""low rider"" build of this trike, with the pedals more out in from of him rather than under his body. I like that it is low and hard to tump over. It has put up with some abuse and still looks great! Tires seem to slowly leak air requiring fillups every few weeks. There were also a few scratches on the wooden piece (when it was brand new) on the back that I probably could have called and gotten replaced, but never got around to that since it had no impact on function and I knew my little guy would eventually be playing hard on it!"
5,Great Trike,"We have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons; 1 was a gift, but the other 2 are kept at our home as I watch the boys daily. The boys, ages 20 months and 3 yrs, love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing. I love them because of the way they are built. The center of gravity is set very low to the ground, making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past. The rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too. (I had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys.) The old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off. All in all, a great trike."
4,Well done,"I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews already posted, and I was not disappointed. The plot is well crafted and the characters are very interesting. While I wouldn't say it was gripping, it was often difficult to put down. A very good introduction to this series."
3,Comfort Food,"I picked up ""The Laughing Policeman"" after seeing it recommended by both the Washington Post's very reliable Michael Dirda and by ""The Corrections"" author Jonathan Franzen, who referred to the book as literary ""comfort food."" Indeed, the book was a perfect fit for the rainy, November days when I read it. The great characters and snappy writing would have earned it four stars, but the heavy-handed political discourse and a sometimes-awkward translation bring it down to three."
1,Garlic get paint coating!,this is definetly a no for me! having silver colored garlic in my meal?? i wonder how healthy would that be. I owned this garlic press for 4 months and that is what i'm constantly getting out of it now... in the garbadge it goes!
3,"Nothing fancy, but it works","In all honesty, after reading the reviews, I expected something much higher quality. I was also under the impression that the part that is used to clean it would attach inside the handle for storage. If it attaches, it is not immediately clear how and I can't see how it would be a very firm attachment. That said, I used it tonight to press some garlic for our meal and was happy with the way it performed. I will have to find a way to keep the small part from getting lost or separated from the press, but it seems to work well and hopefully will last a while."
3,Looking for Roadkill,"Ok, I enjoyed Madam President sooooo much, so I thought this would be a sure thing. Well.....the plot was engaging and interesting. The characters were well drawn and fun, but the squirrel thing has got to go!!!!!!!..."
2,fragile,"I will be returning this toy. I think that there is a short in the car. I also bought the mario car and donkey kong car and the remote for this car works for the mario car. I think that this is also a big flaw that all three cars cannot be used at the same time. Very fragile toy, see my review on the donkey kong remote control car for details. This toy is meant for adults."
4,O Great One,"Allison is among the foremost contemporary interpreters of Kant and this collection, spanning both the German sage's theoretical and practical philosophy, is a gem. In the year I spent trying to master Kant, before submitting to a mild form of dementia, Allison stood on my night table as a constant source of support and clarification, as well as an object of rage and sometimes just as a place to put cups. I can't recommend this book enough."
4,A joy to behold.,I purchased this DVD as a gift for someone special. I wanted to give it to someone along with the book The Velveteen Rabbit. I felt it portrayed the book very well and was entertaining enough for adults as well as children to enjoy. I am sure it is going to be a big hit.DVD came within the time frame promised in very good condition. I would recommend seller.
3,Not well thought out,The scene where the kid's toy rabbit was goading him into jumping from a very tall tree...trying to convince the child he could fly..that was not right. We had to pause the movie and have a quick talk with the kids about that.
1,so disturbing... how can people enjoy this sick fare?,"i was disgusted when i saw this movie in theaters. this kind of excessive violence was horribly disturbing and i can't imagine how people find this entertaining. i'm a 17-year-old Scream fan who enjoys horror movies, but this kind of violence was completely unnecessary and makes me worry about the future of our country if people can watch this stuff without thinking twice. skip this flick unless you've been possessed by demons yourself."
2,"Other than a few (maybe three) lukewarm laughs,","this film is pretty much at the bottom of the stupid level. I must have picked up a version without the ""gross-out"" scenes everyone's talking about. Even the special effects are silly-looking. Bad news all the way around."
3,It was ok,"This album was ok, I don't really remember which songs are on it as I have so many MJ albums and so many of the same songs, I tend to rip them to my computer and put the songs I like in a playlist."
5,Great price,Nothing negative to report... I received my disks very quickly and in great packaging to prevent damage. I think it was a great value for what I needed.
1,"Good coasters, bad DVDs","Not much to say about these. There are 100 on the spindle, and I've tried burning about 20 of them, only two of which were successful. I'm going to donate the rest to a school, in hopes that they're compatible with the school's computers. I'll buy some other blank DVD media instead.BTW, I bought a spindle of 100 CD-Rs from Verbatim at the same time, and I have had no problem with any of them."
1,Coaster City,"I just bought a 50-pack of Verbatim DVD-Rs (16x) from Amazon. Of the ten discs I have burned so far, six failed verification. In all of the hundreds of DVDs I have burned before, I have had this happen maybe twice. This is completely unacceptable and not the kind of quality I expect (and usually get) from Verbatim. Another reviewer warned of Verbatim discs made in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and indeed my discs were made there. So be warned and watch out."
1,Don't waste your money...or time.,These Verbatim DVD-R discs have turned out to be the biggest waste of money and time. Fully half of the discs on the 50 disc spindle are damaged and unusable.
4,Verbatim DVD-R,"Item is as described. I recorded a movie from my computer and played it in my older dvd player and there was no problems with playback at all. Just be sure to finalize your discs after recording and you won't have any problems. I would have given 5 stars but the shipping takes longer than it should, but it may have been because I had this and the CD-R discs that I ordered at the same time combined into 1 shipment/box. I had ordered items from other websites that arrived several days before this package, so if you need your items sooner than later then you should consider upgrading your shipment preferences"
5,VERBATIM - CAN'T GO WRONG,"Over the years it has been a most reliable dvd+-r. Cost a little bit more, but you will always be happy with the results"
4,GOOD BRAND,"I HAD TO BURN MY WEDDING VIDEO DVD AND PURCHASED THESE Verbatim 95101 4.7 GB up to 16x Branded Recordable Disc AZO DVD-R 5..., THEY QUALITY IS GOOD, SO NO COMPLAINS HERE."
3,Wrong grouping!!!!,"Product was fine,shipping on time and arrived in good shape.the only problem was I purchased a lightscribe disc burner, when theGROUPING showed up as customers also bought these with the burner.I should haveread closer, I mean if you order a lightscribe then you will probably want disc for thatproduct! After ordering the discs I needed I wound up with 300 disc total. So be sureto read up on the GROUPINGS!!"
1,Bad for backing up movies,"Works great for data backup. Decided to backup some of the Disney movies we have.After few burned DVDs we did notice a frame freeze on many scenes on many DVDs.The burn speed on my DVD burner is 4X, it is very slow burn, but DVDs still showframe freeze when played back. Original DVDs playback just fine.."
2,faulty in the items!,"First of all, the package came in a big box with the air bags in it. When i opened it, i noticed immediately there's a huge crack on the cap. It's the first time i'm getting things from amazon (instead of individual seller) so that didn't leave a good impression. And the first 3 disks were good. After that, like every other disk i cannot use. I've used the same software with other dvds and never had problem this frequent. I even downloaded new software to try and still no use. So it's obviously the disk's problem. I'm VERY disappointed. I've gotten other brands before, and maybe have not more than 3 disk not usable. So this is very disappointing and i wish i can return it. and I think i'll try to stay away from ordering from amazon and stick with individual sellers."
2,Did not record properly!!!,We tried recording a group of my photos on a DVD-R. My computer lets you burn DVD-Rs. This was terrible!!!! We ended up throwing the whole set away.I went back to burning all my photos onto CD-Rs. I also keep the best and memorable ones on the memory cards.I thought the DVD-Rs would help hold more of the photos as a back-up.It was terrible.
3,prompt curteous service,I wanted this item to record tv shows. the packaging was clean and it included a packing slip. very impressed with the seller.
3,"Needs More Diversity, but Good Musicianship.","The musicianship and effort put into making this album is tremendous. The problem is all the songs pretty much sound the same (to me). I would imagine most people would find this album indistinguishable from Pierced from Within. Why have an album at all, if they are going to be the same? There are some really good songs on this one though. As far as death metal goes, Suffocation is among the top 5 bands. I was lucky to see them play live once, and they were awesome! I would imaging Lamb of God fans would really like Suffocation. However, I myself, lack understanding of what Lamb of God and so many of these bands that all seem to use the same distortion sound, and the same cookie monster voice for song after song. It's hard to have different emotions about these songs. They go from fast angry aggression to slow pounding mosh pit aggression."
5,Janzen and Kindle - Perfect match,"I had only read the Steele Street series by Tara Janzen and loved them. After I purchased my Kindle I was delighted to discover more of her books.River of Eden was a great read. The hero was strong and complicated with layers peeled away throughout the book. The heroine matched him strength for strength and had a couple of surprises herself. I love Tara Janzen's strong female leads...helpless ones make me want to say, ""Pull up your big girl panties.""I'm not going to outline the story. I'll just say - if you can deal with giant anacondas, a tough old man who can perform impossible feats, a madman who builds a giant...did I say giant, snake of gold and a jungle where beauty may be deadly, buy the book now!"
5,Fantastic,"Great story, great characters, plenty of humor, passion, tension...well written, well paced. What more could you ask for? I really hope this author writes some more contemporary fiction."
3,TV Preamp - helps but not as much as expected,"I had a radio shack amp, it was ruined by a electrical surge, and it worked the same or better than this one.This is an expensive unit and the performance does not match the price.Don't expect too much for this price tag."
3,This did not work for me,"I was not able to get thsi unit to resolve my problem. It may not be a fault of the amplifier though. I am not posting this review to hurt the item. But merely to encourage others to look at other reasons why they are not getting reception prior to ordering this from Amazon. this could help avoid returns. If an amplifier is not the problem it likely will not be the solution either. Based on other reviews if this is the solution I am confident it would work quite well. The item seemed well made, and was quite easy to install. Assuming you do not mind climbing on your roof to put it on th emast of your antennae."
1,Preamp not up to snuff,I needed an antenna preamp to boost the local signals in my area. A Radio Shack model was servicable but stopped working. Selected Channel Master because I knew the brand. Dissapointing results - SNR - signal to noise ratio - was worse with the amp. This was determined subjectively by viewing dropouts on known weak signals and watching TV with/without the amp and also by measuring SNR with a Hauppauge HVR-1950 which has a SNR indicator for my computer. I liked the separate preamp and power supply hookup and it was easy to install but it didn't do the job. I replaced it with a Winegard AP-8700 which works much better.
1,Unfortunate Change,"The old 7777 (with a choice of separate or combined inputs)was the best mast top amplifier I ever used. However, after receiving four new series 7777s that refused to produce any signal, I installed a fifth unit that made beautiful pictures. CM replaced the non starters with new product from a different run. Their engineering blamed to much signal or other local causes for the failures. Seemed strange since the fifth unit was installed in the same general area and it worked fine. Less than 90 days later the unit that was working expired during an electrical storm. On the very same tower and antenna two consecutive new 7777s refused to provide even a hint of a picture. Replaced with a Winegard 8275 and got instant reception. All the Channel Masters went back. This product deserves 0 stars!"
3,If you like comic book blood & gore then this is for you.,"This novel starts out resonably straight forward when a group of people are trapped in an old mansion during an all out attack by Martians. At first it seems like everything favours the survival of these people despite the superior Martian technology and then the deaths start...This novel is easy to read - in fact it based on a comic book style ensures that somewhat. It starts out easy but by the end of the book its a bloodbath. If you don't like seeing characters you like killed off at random then avoid this book, but if blood and gore and stomping on Martians is your thing then you may enjoy it."
3,Good,"It wsa an OK book some part were pretty suspensful but it wasn't one of those ""stay up all night reading "" books. I would reccomend reading it but only if it s the only book the library(and book store)have left that you havent read."
5,the glass walls of limbo,"NEVER listen to that tune with a head full of the special juice!!!but if you do ,good luck regaining your sanity and integrity.this o- cd is NY hardcore w/some of those type o atmospheric keyboards.it's sorta like a carnivore cd with josh(the keyboardist)on it to be blunt.this is the type o cd that the metalheads should start out with first cause it's fast and has probably pete's angriest lyrics(my favorite is""hey you on public assistance,go out and get a job.buy some crack and drink some booze,the only things you couldn't rob.socio-parasite""or something like that)if you dig pantera,crowbar,hatebreed,or anything else that can be considered hardcore,you'll enjoy this."
4,It is not GOTH so just stop complaining about it and DIE,The only reason I don't give this album a 5 star is the fact that it does go on for too long on some of the songs. Other than that I have no complaints. It is the perfect kicking around when the ex is away music.
2,"slow, deep, and hard??",in my opinion type o negatives slow deep and hard wasnt nearly as good as october rust or bloody kisses. ive only been listening to the band for about 5 months now and the first album i purchased was october rust which i found to be the best album of the three.i havent yet purchased Origin of the Feces but when i do i hope it will be much better than this release.my suggestion is if you like the gothic/metal sound of october rust dont buy Slow Deep and Hard because the two are nothing alike.
1,Type O Negative is System matic,I love Type O Negative they rule Jst this album was'nt up to what I really like...
1,The card itself is CRAP!,"We haven't used PCMCIA network cards in years, but on a few of our older laptops we decided this would be a good option. We have some 10"" Thinkpads that the techs just keep in their cars in case they're out somewhere without their real laptops and have an I.T. emergency that requires them to VPN back to an office and fix an issue. The internal cards in these units are 802.11b, so we just decided to put these cards in the PCMCIA slots so you could go to a WiFi hotspot and connect to an 802.11 network. Fat chance. These cards connect fine to the older technology, but won't even show our Linksys 802.11n access points, much less connect to them."
4,Demo's !,Great album these demos are much much better than the re-recorded versions on their disapointing LP.The best track is definetly 'Sacrificial Suicide' and is also one the major gun songs in metal history.Not a must buy but if you find it get it because i do believe its going out of print.
2,Satan seems to need money...,"...if you are a die-hard Deicide Fan, you should own this, but only then. This is basically their two AMON-demos released, nothing bad but hell yeah the same as their ""Self-Titled"" Debut! Instead of the Song ""Deicide"" there is ""Oblivious to Nothing"" which is just the same as ""Oblivious to Evil"" from their Debut! Sure there are a few differences ( basically the hellish sound quality), but if you want a great Deicide Record go for ""Deicide"" first. Glenn Benton's passion of shooting animals makes it hard for me to judge Music and People differently, but you have to admit that they are more Death Metal than anything else."
2,Not a very fast moving movie,I love rowing and watching movies which involve rowing. This movie which is specifically about rowing falls short to capture my attention.
4,Best rowing movie out there,"Of course, the pickings are pretty slim. In this film, the rowers actually look like rowers and more importantly, row like them. The story line is pretty good and the acting was above average for a B grade movie. Overall, if it's a rowing movie you're looking for, this is the most accurate portrayal of the sport I have witnessed on film."
1,Oxford is no Miracle,"Ok, the cover looks like a clone of Miracle with Kurt Russell and that is about the best thing this movie has going for it. West looks really young so this is probably a made for tv British film that has been repackage to ride the curtail of West recent critical acclaim on HBO's The Wire and on the success of Disney's Miracle. I didn't finish the movie because I honestly didn't care who won the boat race. Unlike Miracle which keeps you watching despite Russell's wardrobe and great looking toupee, this movie never draws you in and you just wish the boat would sink and drown the entire cast."
1,"Schmalz, glitz... no guts!","I have no idea what Gene was attempting to pull off with this album, so for all I know it wasn't an attempt, he was successful. But I hope for his sake it was more like a failed experiment. Kinda like a mix of chemicals sitting on a Bunsen Burner and exploding into a fireball of badness. I hate to focus on negatives in my reviews, but I feel it's necessary to steer the unwitting clear of this one. I think that it's fairly obvious just by reading the (breif) liner notes what can be expected. We see that an orchestra is credited, and then the appearances by Donna Summer, Helen Reddy (!?!?!!), and Cher. Yeah, overproduction, overextension, and ultimately overblown. I'm sure Gene had a big role in ""Music from the Elder,"" too. There is an interesting parallel here. Not that I could do any better, but really, we expected much more from you, Gene."
3,Gene shows his human side,When I originally bought this album on vinyl years ago I expected a hard rocking album to go with his image. I was shocked but after the intial shock wore off I realised the album isn't bad at all. The only weakness to me is there are too many ballads. While I do like ballads too many can be boring after a few songs. Overall this is a good record and shows his real influences.
2,The least exciting of the four solo albums!,"Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would say that Simmons recorded the least exciting album of the four Kiss members. The opening ""Radioactive"" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding ""See you tonight"" and the quite rocking ""Burning up with fever"" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing ""When you wish upon a star"", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills."
3,This CD is not that bad for a first time solo try.,"I listen to the entire CD and found it was well done, not the best but well done. I could tell that people where expecting something harder but if you give this CD a try, then you can say if you like or not. It could have been done more better then it was but when you are the only one writing the song for this CD then there would be less ideal and maybe he didn't want to create an over baster of metal that we hear from Kiss, but something that diffent. I think that if he does another CD, I think he would get it right and heavy but most people would still not like it. This CD is somewhat heavy if you listen to it. To tell you the truth he sound something like Paul."
2,Gene Simmons sings Barry Manilow!,"Gene, what was going on in your head here? I thought you liked to rock, I thought you spit blood and breathed fire! But dueting with the likes of Donna Summer and Helen Reddy is beyond comprehendible! What the heck are those strings doing in the background? A wah-wah guitar? The only thing that saves you from one-star shame here is.... I don't even know."
2,A Legend In His Own Mind....,"I heard Gene thought his solo album was the best of the four. Oh really? Only the song ""See You in Your Dreams"" saves this effort from sinking to a one star rating. After listening to all 4 solo albums (on vinyl) again after 25 years, it is way ""too"" easy to see why Kiss went downhill after Ace's departure. Paul's effort is solid, but only a shade above ordinary hard rock. And bless Peter for trying. This? You'll maybe listen to it once all the way thru; that's if you don't keel over laughing during the final track. The sound samples here are all you need to convince you."
1,Worst cd ever stay away- 0 stars,"I have been a kiss fan for 30 years. I love kiss but I hate this cd. I hated it when it came out and I hate it now.how Gene Simmons could make such an awfull excuse for a record I just don't know. even hard core fans I no agree stay away.only worth buying to complete a collection,not for listening pleasure. my advise STAY AWAY IT SUCKS!the other 3 our pretty good , Ace is the best in my view of the solos.not one of the solo albums is a lovegun album so keep that in mind."
3,not a bad album,"most of the songs on here are good minus when you wish upon a star, just because gene wrote some mellow tunes doesnt mean it sucks,radioactive was recorded in salt lake city utah after the love gun show, i took a tour of the studio in jr. high school and the engineer told us how passionate gene was about this song and album. it brings back alot of memories for me this was a great time to be in the kiss world when disco and all that horrible crap was out there,not the best kiss album but a good one."
3,the solo is good but not the best.,I Like THE SOLO. IT`S NOT LIKE IT WAS THE BEST. Radioactive it rock`s. LIVING IN SIN is a Little off the wall but hay is`s still a good song.SEE YOU TONIGHT . I love that song. WHEN YOU WISH UPONS A STAR. I just can`t see Gene doing that one but hey that`s Gene. BUT ALL AND ALL A GOOD CD. THANK YOU.
1,This is bad,"I think that this album should have never been released. A little better than Criss' solo album, which is not saying much, Radioactive and See You Tonight are average at best while the rest is BAD!"
1,These lids are too big for a Roughneck 32g trash can!!,"My Rubbermaid wheeled Roughneck 32Gal trash cans, circa 2003, are 20 1/2 inches diameter at the top. These lids are 22 1/2 inches dia. and way too big. They ""sort of "" fit and if you put them on sideways the handles will clamp them on, although very loosely. Any amount of wind will blow them off. It costs more than its worth to return them. The data in the ad said they were 20.4 "" so I was led to believe they would be the right replacement but it doesn't do any good to measure carefully and check the specs when the ad lies to you"
1,Don't fit!,"Trash can lids don't fit my Rubbermaid cans. I ordered three and might not return them as it probably costs more than it's worth. I saw a lot of reviews stating the size issue, but I positively thought they'd fit mine. They're about 2 inches bigger than the can.I might return them or maybe just recycle them, but I'm still stuck without any covers."
1,"Thought it matched my garbage cans, but it didn't","I should have listened to the other reviews. Even though we had 32 gallon Rubbermaid roughneck garbage cans, this one was too big. It does fit an old can without wheels, but that's not the one we needed. If you're thinking about this one, measure."
4,upgrade from factory original,The 1st thing I do when getting a new vehicle is to replace the Air filter with a K&N - I see an uptick in mileage and performance.
2,No es lo que esperaba,El material de estas piesas no es lo que esperaba. No cocinan bien los alimentos. No me gusto para nada.
3,"by Tanner, Kayla, Jacob, Michael, Haley","Stuart Little is about a mouse that lives with the Littles and goes on many adventures. We liked the book because in some parts it was funny. In one part, Stuart got shut in the fridge. We gave this book three stars because it didn't tell what happened to Margalo at the end."
2,What a let down,This book left nothing but loose ends. I was so suprised because Charlotte's Web is wonderful. The author writes well but the story is very weak. Seems like the author was lazy and could not finish the book. Overall very disappointing.
4,Who would have ever thought a mouse could have so much fun?!,"Stuart Little is a great book to spark children's imaginations. Since you never know what that tiny mouse will get into next, it hold's your attention well. Great for a classroom read-aloud!"
5,Stuart Little,I read the book Stuart Little. I like this book because it has a lot of adventures. I like this book because it is about a mouse that travels all over the world to find his true love. Me and my mother both read this book and we both loved it because it was about being adventorous. I liked this book so much that i went and bought it. I am going to read it to my kids when they get to be about 6 years old. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes adventures and animails. I hope this review is helpful to you.
5,Love the crocs,I bought these for my 5 year old daughter. She hates wearing shoes! Usually flip-flps are her shoe of choice. But she loves these Crocs! They fit well and are much cuter than the original croc shoes.
1,Blisters,"My daughter has been wearing crocs for a few years. This is the first year we purchased the mary jane style. Within the first hour of wear, she was complaining they hurt the sides of her feet and we took them off. She had blisters on both feet, both sides where the strap is attached to the crocs symbol. We returned them right away and exchanged them for the classic croc style which has been fine."
2,Well written does not equal a good read.,"Auster has had such remarkable reviews, I was thrilled with my first read. I approached the book knowing I'd find a good story, well told. Nope! The technical finesse of Auster's writing became secondary to the lack of real story. The device Auster uses to reveal his story is laborious, boring and extremely self conscious. I kept waiting for the story to begin and instead was insulted by too many coincidences and one dimensional characters. I wondered why I kept reading. At the end, I was dissatisfied and unclear how the FBI could have made the leaps required to solve the mysteries. In addition, the murder on the trail made no sense; it was not consistent with DiMaggio's backstory nor did I understand any part of why he was on that road. All too contrived. I have to decide if I will read more of Auster's books... I know I will be more willing to stop reading if I am not entranced with in the first 90 pages or so."
3,Quite disapointing,"It is not as good as I thought it would be, it is written for children and it doesnt have a plot, each story is 7 page long and without any interesting part. for me the shipping was expensive and I recieved a children's comic."
5,The greatest version of Superman's Origin.,"John Byrne has done to Superman what he needed to have done. All of the anoying, cheesy parts of the Superman Legend have been removed, while essential new parts (such as leaving his parents alive and a millionaire Lex Luthor) are so good, I don't see how they had been left out. John Byrne has given everyone a personality, and a likable one at that. He draws Superman the way he is meant to be drawn. Finally, a believable Superman."
2,Not as bright as the older Piaa Super Plasma bulbs,"This is my second set of Piaa Super Plasma bulbs and it's definitely not as bright as the set I bought 2 years ago. These run at a lower temperature I think and still has a yellowish tint whereas the first set matched my xenon lights much better, they even have a slight purplish tint. If you're looking for a set of bulbs to match xenons these are not the ones."
1,I have 120v soft white bulbs whiter than this junk,"I have used PIAA for a number of years. I bought the 9006 plasma gt-x because the website claimed the color was 5000K. They are not white they are yellow (I did not buy the Plasma yellows by mistake), if they hit 3500-3800K they would be lucky. They are no better than stock bulbs at 2.5 times the price. When I wrote PIAA about this for a refund, they basically told me to fly a kite. PIAA said they don't give refunds and maybe I can get my money back from the retailer. The retailer does not give refunds for a product that works (they didn't make the claim of the color of the light).[...]Bottom line, No company warrantyColor is not as claimedDon't buy this product"
5,Fantastic,"Much brighter, and cleaner lights than other aftermarket lights I have bought in the past. I used to be a Sylvania fan, but these blow them out of the water. I will buy these again!"
2,Light disappointment,"(Used on a '99 Acura Integra)I felt my OEM bulbs were beginning to show their age, lacking in brightness and distance illumination (they were Sylvania), decided to go with PIAA for their reputation. While not much brighter or whiter than OEM quality, they did seem to project a slightly ""cleaner"" light. The light is focused on the center, with more illumination to the passenger side than driver's (probably to protect the eyes of oncoming traffic). I'm a little disappointed these don't have a whiter shine, and a further reach, despite being advertised as 5000K and shine as a 100W bulb, NEITHER IS TRUE. Glad these didn't cost a fortune, because I'm going to look for alternatives.If you're looking for brighter (than OEM) and actually WHITE light, look elsewhere, but definitely not these."
4,ALMOST PERFECT FANTASY - ALMOST!!!,"With the GOOD & BAD reviews, I would have to agree with both agruments ... but STORM RIDERS is definately worth watching!!! A fantasic, brilliant story with limited fighting ... STORM RIDERS I believe lives up to it's hype! Story is easy to follow, good story indeed, compared to others of its kind. The CGI effects were spectacular, but it was confusing in one or two areas only! It was fun, interesting, and most important ... it kept you glued to the screen.The VHS edition is a 90 min. film vs. DVDs 128 min. -- your missing out on many deleted scenes watching the VHS edition.IMPORTANT : The VHS has ENGLISH DUBBING - if you hate to read. The DVD does not!!!If anything ... I wished for two things:1. A little more fight scenes. 2. DVD with English Dubbling!!! I can read ... but, prefer not too!!!"
2,Don't be confused with the 1998 film!,"This version ""Wind and Cloud - The Storm Riders"" made in 2004 is not the same as ""The Storm Riders"" made in 1998.This dvd is a condensed version of a TV series packaged by Tai Seng. It is full-screen and was made for TV. It is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours.Most people doing the reviews for this DVD is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Chen."
4,"Good, but could use work","I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had some pretty good fights, an interesting story and great characters. The problem, and one of the reasons why I didn't give it a 5, is because its SO disjointed. Tai Seng is a lot like a double-edged sword. They've got several TV Dramas that they release in the States subtitled, but they edit them to fit a smaller format. They've fit 30 hours of story into 2 hours. To do this, they removed a lot of side story and just plopped the viewers into the middle of some stuff with just enough information to sort things out. The only other downfall to this movie is that in several spots, the CGI effects look really, horribly bad/cheesy. Overall, however, it still was a good movie."
3,Fun but old school,it was entertaining but the graphics and stuff were very outdated but I watched this as a kid and still like it.
2,The Storm Riders,"Well shipping was fine but when I got my product the jewl case was busted pritty bad like someone sat on it. Im in the process to see if it wasnt damaged. The bubble rap wasn't tampered with at all not a single bubble popped which lead me to believe that it was shipped that way. From the 30 min that i have seen of the movie it looks ok and it is the storm riders i was looking for not the knock off. However since this is the more recent version I was expecting it to be an ""in english"" option. Guess i was goin crazy when i saw it at a friends house and thought i saw it in english..."
2,Where is the fighting?,"A lot of pouting, non-sexually threatening young Asian actors and not a whole lot else. There is basically no martial arts to speak of in this film (don't confuse wiring an actor to zoom around a set or CGI environment with real kung fu). What fighting there is takes the form of magic fire balls, etc., being hurled about by flying, angsty actor. Shu Qi is gorgeous as always, probably the best thing in this otherwise below average movie. If you are a kungfu fan, forget this film. If you just want to look at models posing, then this is something for you.Oh, and the story is just terrible."

4,"Rough, but a different perspective","I found this book to be a great supplement to Learning Perl which is quite terse to rely on alone. Granted, this book is dated and has some typos, but also has very good examples and wording is clear.Not a costly book since it's out of print-- well worth a read for the enthusiastic novice."
5,Wonderful,"This is one of the coolest art books I've seen, Komar and Melamid are geniuses! The whole idea art designed to please isn't that new but the idea using polls and statistics is. By using a random survey from several countries ( THe USA France China Kenya Russia Ukraine ect) they create each countries most and least wanted painting and take you through a wonderful romp discussing what art and expression and stuff are really all about. I gave this sucker out as X-mas presents! I can't reccommend it highly enough. Buy everything by Komar and Melamid...even their souls.... they did a thing in Moscow where they auctioned off their souls.If you ever get a chance to see their 'Nostalgia' series of paintings, it's a hoot. Sort of satires of Soviet/Stalinist paintings, very good. THey also did a series of NYC as ruins in the jungle...."
3,"Great film, poor DVD-quality","A great film with one of the best soundtracks ever written. I was eagerly yearning for this DVD to be released, but I am now very, very disappointed: The DVD is definitely not digitally remasted"" as stated on the cover, but it obvoiusly seems to be a very poor transcription from a rental-VHS-tape which has been viewed dozens of times. Both the picture and sound quality are miserable. It is really a pity that this great movie is treated that way. I hope that another company will re-release it in proper quality."
1,KATELAND,"DISAPPOINTING...I was looking forward to watching this movie. But after just 3 minutes of trying to watch it, i had to remove it from my DVD player, and never to be put back in there again. The quality of the picture was very poor. I was hardly able to see any kind of picture at all. SHAME...SHAME...SHAME. If i had read some of the reviews about this film, befor i went ahead and purchased it, then i would, have found out about the poor picture quality, As someone was bound to have mentioned that. But i saw this movie in the 1980s on television, and rememberd it well, so felt i didnt need to read up reviews on it. I saw a lovely clear picture when i saw it on TV. Now that its been put on to DVD the picture quality is shocking. Buyers Beware."
2,"Normally a Good Product, but they also produce turkeys","I have used and sworn by Verbatim products for some time. This was my first foray into Verbatim branded lightscribe disks as I could not find my old standbys (Imation). Unfortunately, about 50% of the disks failed to pass the write verification tests, making them the most expensive disks in both dollars and time I have ever used, and I now have an extremely large set of coasters."
4,Good for Create Your Own,"Always had a problem with paper labels, but with LightScribe, it's much better. Of course, you need computer capability."
2,Scratch VERY easily,"I guess you get what you pay for. These discs are THE MOST prone to scratch that I have ever seen. Print lightscribe well, but good luck keeping you data readable."
5,Great product,I never have a problem with these discs. Reasonably priced and the product was delivered in pristeen condition.
1,Not a Match with Windows,"My Windows Laptop has burned every kind of DIsk-- and generally works great. Except with Verbatim. To date, I'm getting it to accept/acknowledge about 1 in every 5 disks I try to burn. Save your money and get something else."
1,CD Side-Perfect...Label Side-horrible!!,"I've had no issues with these discs being recognized by Nero or XP for burning the data side. BUT, the label side leaves a lot to be desired! The labels I DO get to print fade, but the biggest issue is wasting my time burning the label, then finding out most of it did not burn in and is not visible! I've had to get into the habit of burning the label first, then IF IT IS OK (only about a 50/50 chance), I then burn the data side!"
5,Verbatin LightScribe CDs,After using plain LightScribe disks to write on I was amazed at what a difference the colored ones made. After using a couple of them I doubt that I will ever go back to the plain ones.
4,Interesting Review of Prescription and Other Drugs,"The authors, both phd's in the subject matter, present a wide range of ""brain enhancing"" prescription and non- prescription remedies . Each is ranked according to effectiveness and risk along with a great desription of what it is, how it is supposed to work, studies of the material and a effectiveness and risk scale.Very interesting and a good source. Would second source the recommendations before becomming a crash test dummy for these drugs."
1,I regret buying this book!,"This is a very biased, uninformative book. The research views are very narrow and the author treats the readers like children, as though the readers are not capable of drawing their own conclusions.I'm extremely disappointed with this book!I do NOT recommend this book, at all.I've found books such as ""Mind Boosters"" far more informative and enlightening."
1,Queen - Back for more Cash,"Sickening - I am NOT All right now. Queen was, is and will always be Freddie Mercury, Brian May is a good guitarist, Roger Taylor is a decent Drummer and John Deacon who really cares. The bottom line is if Freddie were alive he could have toured withthe local high school band and it would be 100 times better than this GARBAGE. Paul Rodgers was ok in his day, but, his day has long passed. I agree with the other review, at least have the decency to bring along a decent lead singer. The song collecion was poor and Bohemian Rhapsody is a total joke, a 3 minute replay of the original and 2 minutes of Paul Rodgers ruining the end. They can call themselves what they want, all I know is FREDDIE IS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE - THIS IS NOT QUEEN."
3,"I enjoyed it, but its just not the same...","I realize that Paul is not a ""replacement"" as no one could replace Freedie Mercury, but some of these songs just dont sound right at all with his voice. I saw them live and it was great, but the whole time I kept thinking ""If only I was 15 years older in the 80s I could have seen the real group"". ATTENTION QUEEN! Jeff Scott Soto has been let go by Journey..how bout picking him up?? He can really sing those Queen songs well! That would just be too good though."
3,Unnecessary,"Don't get me wrong, I am very happy for Roger and Brian that they can still draw a big crowd, and they should ! Queen with Paul Rodgers are definitely worth seeing, but do we really need a new live album ? It's not, that the songs are bad, but Freddie is just not replaceable... songs like 'A kind of magic' or 'We are the Champions' only work with Freddie on lead vocals. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' with Freddie's vocals from tape is just 'creepy'. That said, Paul's songs sound great with Brian on guitar. So what I would like to see, is a 'Queen feat. Paul Rodgers' album with all new material. If you like the old Queen classics played live, then I highly recommend any of the previously released concert CDs with the incredible Freddie Mercury on vocals."
1,HOW COULD THEY,"This is absolutely the worst album that I've ever heard. I didn't even want to give it one star, but the system makes you rate the album. If you are a true Queen fan, you should not buy this album. It is painful to listen to Paul Rogers attempt to even sing a Queen song and try to ""act"" like Freddie Mercury."
1,No.. please!,"Ok, I'm banal... but it's not possible to replace FREDDIE MERCURY!!!!Paul Rodgers... who are you?? Why you are trying to destroy Freddie's songs?By now, ""Queen"" means ""Money Machine"". Sad, but true."
3,Almost the Exact Same As 3rd Edition,"It is an interesting textbook; easily readable and understandable.Instead of paying $86 for the third edition I risked getting this, 2nd edition and it turns outthey are both almost absolutely the same.The 3rd addition comes with a CD and you get access to a supplmental website - but if you do your reading you can get by without the supplemental material just fine.If you are a decent student, I recommend getting the 2nd edition (today available used on amazon for 78 cents).If you go to class, read the book and fufill any writing assignments then you can do just fine with the 2nd edition."
4,It was good.,"It seemed a little bit worn, but hey, it's practically the same as the new edition and you can't beat the price either."
5,Perfect,This book was purchased from an independent retailer through Amazon and I am very happy with it. The item was in excellent condition and is exactly what I needed for my Sociology class. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,This book is absolutely WONDERFUL!,"I recently bought this book and have since then been unable to put it down! I love psychology, and this covers my favorite aspects of it: Freudian psychology, behaviorism, personality traits, etc. It includes sections on schools of thought and their founders, personality disorders, psychological tests, schemas, a whole chapter on self-esteem, states of being, addictive personalities, and even changing one's personality. It is so in-depth, easy to understand, and down-to-earth. I recommend this to anyone interested in psychology, personality, and how the mind functions."
1,Sam Storms self-review!,"This is what Storms had to say about his own book. I have not read it, just thought it would be helpful for people considering to buy such an expensive book that's out of print. This review comes from a list by Storms highlighting his ""bottom ten list."" The entire article can be found here:[...]""[His book as number 10]: No, this isn’t a joke. Neither is it a bad attempt at false humility. It’s simply a bad book. Forgive me for having written it. I suppose a good portion of what I wrote is o.k., but that doesn’t justify the rest of the nonsense I put forth in this regrettable effort to undermine people’s confidence in the healing power of God today. It’s out of print (thank God), so don’t write me asking for an autographed copy."""
1,Definetly not for children plus it stinks!,"We generally love the composer series but this one reeks. It is silly and stupid and teaches you next to nothing about Bizet.Also it is trashy and sleazy and depressing. It is totally inappropriate for the children at which it is aimed, and it's too silly and inane for an adult to appreciate.Definetly a video you can live without. Don't say I didn't warn you."
5,Start of a magical journey that will change your life.,"This book has set the standard of what a goodfantasy story should look like.I keeps you going, revealing enough to be intriguingbut leaving enough to the imagination foryou to ravel in."
5,Highly Underrated and Truly Well-Done,"I say this movie years ago on television and have been searching for it ever since, for nearly 7 years. The fact that it's so unknown is rather sad.The acting is well-done, with the perfect amount of levity and angst to balance each other out. The dancing is truly superb, and the music is perfect."
4,So far so good. Purchased this model in white.,"Purchased to replace an Invacare handheld shower that never really measured up.This handheld is very easy to install (be sure to have a roll of teflon tape before the install), and appears to be durable. Water pressure is acceptable.Has minimal water jet options which I LIKE. Why? Because the fewer options there are, the fewer there are to break later. The stop/pause spray function is easy to use, and the thumb lever spray head adjustment dial is fine though we didn't desire it nor do we need it.The length of the hose was critical as we're using this to shower in a sitting position. Hose is great - extra long.Handle is comfortable. Packaging was fine. Shipping was fast.Don't buy a cheaper model."
4,A Very Heartwarming Story,"This was a very heartwarming story about the bond between human and canine. The pictures were very sweet, as well. The only thing that prevents me from giving a 5-star review is that I would have liked a bit more text. The author has a nice writing style, I just wish she would have shared more of her words with the reader.Matilda Mae: The Dog Who Needed a Name"
1,Page count was wrong.,"I know this is a silly complaint, but it didn't have enough pages. The Product Details said that it had 256 pages. It only had 236 pages. I needed a history book with 250 pages or more for an assignment for school. I can't use it for school, so this book is now useless to me. For that reason, despite whatever other redeeming values it may have, I feel that the only fair rating that can come from me is the lowest possible.Fix the typo! 236 pages. Geez."
4,Budgie's early music,"This is not a bad little CD, Budgie had yet to reach it's height's in the heavy metal world but I enjoyed the music being a Budgie fan. The best stuff was still yet to come. As this was my first ""venturing"" into early Budgie, I found a strong similarity to Led Zepplin music, except for guitar styles both guitarist were good just, different."
3,STILL THE FORMATIVE YEARS.,"THOUGH NOT A BAD ALBUM,THIS IS STILL NOT AS GOOD AS THE DEBUT.AT LEAST THREE SONGS ARE KEEPERS,WHISKEY RIVER(GOOD BOURGE SOLOS),HOT AS A DOCKER'S ARMPIT!!,AND ROCKING MAN(REMINDS ME OF PURPLE IN SOME SPOTS,DON'T KNOW WHY?).I'D HAVE TO SAY ONLY FOR COMPLETISTS,NOT A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR THIS BAND,BUY THE DEBUT ALBUM FIRST,BUT OF COURSE BUY THE BLOODY THING EVENTUALLY.NOT BAD,NOT GOOD.3 STARS FOR THOSE THREE SONG ONLY."
3,The Girl Who Had Everything,"I cannot review it...I sent it to my sister's house and haven't been there to see the movie--yet. The main reason I ordered it was so that I could look at the costar, Fernando Lamas."
4,Best darn book on this man,"I had a chance to read this book and I must say this is as far the best book I have read on this great artist. It is proven without a trace of a doubt that Brian Jones was murdered on the night of July 7, 1969. It is a shame that the man who killed him isn't around anymore to see what Anna Wholin has written about this faithful night. It is great to see that at the end of his life he had somebody with him who loved him a lot. All in all this is a book that I would recommend to the people like me who liked and admired thid man. It is well written and it is the kind of book that you can't put down. Once again I highly recommended it."
3,Suspicious...,Whilst reading the book (interesting as I found it) I couldn't help having some suspicions about the author. Seeing pictures of her (and her alone!) prancing around as a dancer seemed a little out of place in a book about the appalling murder of a man she supposedly adored...
1,Waste,"The idea is great, but it was a waste of money. It's just not realistic as far as maintenance and keeping it out of the way."
3,Don Cherry Blue Lake,"Like the previous afficionado I was intrigued by this release and couldn't tell what it was ""from the outside"" of the packaging. I brought a 180 Gram vinal copy. Good news: it IS rare (and may not stay around too long), there are moments of startling trumpet playing, the percussionist IS neat and the sound is pretty good. Not as good: I am not a fan of Don's piano playing (he is pretty plain and elemental to my ears)and the limitations show up in the Dollar Brand (now Abdullah) compositions if you (as I am) are an Ibrahim fan. All in all, the extraordinary moments (especially trumper interludes) make this worthwhile especially if you are a Cherry fan. I would recommend the Old and New Dreams and Codona work before this but is is a NEAT release!"
2,There are Better Books,"If You're looking for a book that specifically focuses on weight training for basketball, you'll be better served by some other books out there. Aside from teh foreword and initial introduction, This seems more like any other weight training book than anything specifically basketball related. Try ""Complete Conditioning for Basketball"" instead.Complete Conditioning For Basketball (DVD/Paperback Book)"
5,Verbatim is must go-to brand for my DVDs,"Bought this spindle of Verbatim blank DVDs. Verbatim is one of my preferred brands for blank DVDs. TDK is another. Sony is yet another. But Verbatim is what is always remembered by me at the top of my memory.As for this particular recently bought spindle of 50 blank DVDs, so far have personally burned a dozen of the DVDs on a macbook and on a windows laptop without a failed burn. So, that's satisfaction for me.FYI, ordered this spindle of blank DVDs directly from Amazon for sixteen bucks with the free shipping (when combined with the order of a book from Amazon)."
3,Luck of the draw,"I've always liked Verbatim, never had any problems with the media. However, quality seems to be on a steady decline. More and more cake boxes I find discs with imperfections/bubbles, nicks and scratches, fingerprints, rings around the edges, etc on the data side of the disc. I've had quite a few bad discs in this batch which is surprising. Thankfully it was only $16.84 for 50 discs, which isn't bad.Overall, I'm disappointed that I've had so many bad discs so far, and I've only burned about 10, had to throw away 8 to 10 so far. The 10 that I have burned have been fine however."
5,Army wives season 3,Army Wives is my number favourite Show from a america! I cannot wait to see season 7 to start! Army wives is the best
4,Great Show,"When the show started, my husband had just gone to boot camp. Of course I had to watch the show! It is nothing like being a true Army Wife, and my dear husband likes to sit there watching it with me, making fun of all the stuff that they get wrong. And trust me on those horrible corny moments so do I.But does Grey's Anatomy show the real life of an intern? I dont think so. And so it is with all the other shows. LOL. So once I get past the fact that its nothing like the lives of all the Army Wives I know. YOU HAVE TO LOVE THE SHOW!!!!It is full of drama, entertainemnt and people trully trying to find who they are. I love hwo the characters are developed. And while they may not get what really happens in military lives, you still see their struggle! Cant wait for season 4 to start!!!"
4,Wife's show,"Everytime I come into the family room, it seems she is watching multiple episodes. So, based on that, I will rate it 4 starts. LOL..."
4,Intimidating!,"Is there any CD that rivals the opening of this disc? ""Light fuse, Get Away"" would be a good way to describe it. You'll be hearing ""Suffer, bastard!"" in your head long after you've turned the stereo off.The album as a whole is inconsistent. There are some really great songs (Martyr, Crash Test, Desecrate) but the rest of the album could be better.Also note that this is death metal plain and simple. It's hard to understand the ""singer"" much of the time, but this is one of the very few death metal bands I'll tolerate."
1,A disappointment,"After a week of frustration, I'm returning my Helix and canceling my XM subscription. I live in a major city with XM ground repeaters, close to a lake and my home has clear views of the southern sky. Nevertheless, my Helix would randomly lose its signal; I could go for a couple hours with clear reception but then the signal would drop-usually when a breeze came up and rustled the leaves. I spent lots of frustrated hours trying to adjust the antenna. I would have been willing to mount it outdoors, but the cable is too short.Additionally, XM would not refund my activation fee. Thus, I'm paying $9.99 to learn that their service is unreliable. Until satellite radio (and their customer service practices) enter the 21st century, I'll stick to old-fashioned radio."
1,"Wordy, overdone biography. de-romanticizes Eleanor Aquitaine","I read this book for an analytical report, and it came higly recommended. I was very disappointed by its windy, ostentatious style and unclear references to obscure events and people. The author writes in a Dickensian style, but only in the sense that it appears Ms. Kelly was paid by the word. In researching the report that this book was used in, I came across three-page biographies of that fascinating medieval queen that gave me far more information in a more cohesive, concise way than this entire 450+ page book. ""Eleanor and the four Kings"" just gets bogged down with muddy tangents and unnecessary, minute details. The author's voice has a holier-than-thou resonsnce and assumes a certain level of complete amoebic-mindedness in the reader. I strongly reccomend steering clear of this book and looking Eleanor up in an encyclopedia or reading ""A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver"" instead."
5,Glimpses into an Eventful Life,"I found ""Point-To-Point Navigation"" compelling from beginning to end. Whether he is regaling us with fascinating tales of the famous, or granting us glimpses into life at his beloved Swallow's Nest, which clings to a cliff far above the Tyrrhenian sea at Ravello, Gore Vidal writes with effortless prose and ironic wit, as he conducts us on an intimate voyage point-to-point through the last forty years of his life. Often poignant, Mr. Vidal's kaleidoscopic episodes are always interesting."
4,Great Bay Area style thrash!,Back in the day this was a CD I loved to listen to. In fact I considered Defiance a band that Testament should have been! The vocals are very close to Chuck Billy and they even use Alice in Chains style vocal harmonies. Musically they are very proficent. Guitars are heavy and tight. Solos right on. Drums tight as can be and creative. Reminds me of ...And Justice for All (one of metallica's best) writing and production. Should own this one if you are into classic thrash!
4,"Good, but very dated","This is a reprint of an LEAA text that appears to have been written in the 1970's. While a good text for its' subject, the FBI's Physical Evidence text is comparably priced, has equivalent coverage, and is up to date, considering current technology and rules of evidence."
3,LSD in print,"Appropriately enough, I read this in the midst of a presidential election. It start out with great promise, degraded into muddled images and illogic and ended with tepid results.The opening third may be worth the price of the book. It raises the hair on the nape of your neck, as well as expectations for horrors that may come. But then it slides into a protracted account of tripping that would make Dr. Timothy Leary envious. Long on imagery, short on action, explanation and resolution."
2,Some of it was good...most of it was terrible!,I have to agree with the reviewers from Illinois and Ohio. There are about 30 really good pages of horror which were very scary however after that the plot totally changes and it just lost me in all this end-of-the-world/space-time imagery that it was impossible to follow...not that I even really cared to follow because it wasn't scary at all. As a science-fiction book it was o.k. but as a horror book it was really lame.
5,the house on the borderland,"I am reading The House On The Borderland but have not finished yet,I have to say that this book could have been written in todays time period because this book is entirely fresh and new without yesterdays sometimes wordy novels,if you love a great sci-fi and horror story combined then this is it the authors imagination was far beyond his time because as I said this book could have been written today,so order and read you will not be disappointed."
3,A bit of a letdown,"The entire story is told as a narration, not through dialogue, and that irritates me really. The comics medium is supposed to bring the narration through pictures, and the story should unfold through dialogues. Maybe the story is unfit for the medium, since there are a lot of panels where the main character is alone, still, Corben should and could have found a way to make it much more fun.The characters are not well built, and it is hard to identify with someone you haven't really met. Which is important since the genre should be horror, but I can't say I got scared, or thrilled at all.The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of the artwork of one of my favorite comic artists. The bottomline: recommended only for true Corben fans, otherwise you can skip this one."
2,Oh so dated... and boring,"What starts with the feel of the classic it's described as (or suppossed to be), it then just rambles off in to space (literally). Some simple descriptions take pages and pages as if we can't understand a ""copper colored sky"". If this author was at the forefront of the genre, then I'm not sure what the genre is (Thriller, Science Fiction, Fantasy). I know it's a hundred years old. Great, that earned it another star. Don't bother."
5,ACIM audio CD's,"Great to have this in the car. I can listen as I go back & forth to work each day...far better for me than listening to what the 'world' has to offer. Mr Stewart's voice is resonant, sincere and there is no mistaking the words he's saying."
5,Want to purchase audio version,I really want to purchase this audio book. I currently read this book on ibook and I love it. It is a great source of peace. Thank you guys for your reviews this is on my wish list.
2,Not usable for crafts,It looks good on the picture.I liked the colors and the size of pieces when I saw but it is so thick that you can not bend or cut or do anything.Total dissappointment.I think the item is not described well.Do not recommend to buy
1,None of the colors represented in the picture were sent,"The product is extremely thick, unable to do anything with it. Tried to send it back but postage is as much as the cost of the product. Emailed and tried calling the company and so far no one has responded. I'll just have to throw it away and be out the money I paid."
5,She loved it!,My daughter loved it. We could not find a blue dog snugglers in any store. We found it here!
2,Can NOT handle pressure,In the last two weeks I've had 2 of these leak from the seam on the bottom of the filter. It does a GREAT job of biological filtration but with any significant pressure load it leaks. I was running it on the return side of an Ocean Clear canister powered by an 800gph little giant pump. It cant take that basic pressure so sadly I cant use it. It might be better suited to running off a lower flow powerhead but since my tank is drilled in the bottom I have no use for this since I don't want to run something up top that would obstruct the view of the tank. Too bad it's not more sturdy it would have made a great addition to my filtration.
4,A Mid Somers Night Dream,"Impressive debut album! The Somers Dream Orchestra doesn't break any new ground on their first album, but their selections and musicality are true to the originals. All of the musical selections are played with energy and vitality, making for a foot-tapping listen. Many of the songs fit the 'new swing' craze that has swept the nation.The vocals are particularly refreshing, and are well-placed throughout the album. One can almost imagine a dance hall full of couples swining to the tunes of ""Leap Frog"", ""Woodchopper's Ball"", or ""On the Street Where You Live"".Although the solos are kept short and sweet, all are thoughfully and professionally presented. Certain selections lend themselves to specific styles, and the soloists obviously had these in mind while crafting their ideas.Overall a great presentation, and some wonderful listening, reminiscent of the great Big Bands of yesteryear. Definitely a fine addition to anyone's swing library!"
4,Works great for lines and bags,"Recommend product to other guys over 50 who are showing signs of aging around the eyes.....apply a dab twice a day and in a month, lines disappeared and ""bagginess"" under eyes is less noticeable..."
4,Great Tool For The Chest,I've owned this snare drum for years and it is a joy to play. It can go from efx or side snare to main with a head change and tuning. I currently use a clear sound dot head tuned high for piercing accents. The only upgrade I would like is to have the SuperHoop II's for better rimshots and the higher tuning tension will eventually warp the thinner hoops on this drum. I've found this to be a great recording snare for it's short sustain and it's shallow depth absorbs less vibration from the other drums reducing snare buzz. The strainer and butt system is the most basic but that's to be expected at this price range. It doesn't quite suit the heavier style band I play with now but I still play it at home whenever I have the chance. It's an awesome snare drum to add to your arsenal!
4,"Heavy Metal, it's beginning Mercyful Fate","I enjoy this album very much. I love the hard licks, the vocals and believe that this MF album ranks in there with the other MF albums, dark, haunting, yet uplifting and great vocals and a rocking, heavy pulsing beat!"
3,Helpful,A good listen although I use it begore I go to bed and usually fall asleep before it is done. I am going to try listening to it at an earlier time. LOL
2,Quality is an Issue,"This CD was obviously a tape, and remastered somehow. It's not a good quality recording. That said, it will get me to sleep. I listen to it with volume low enough that the whispering just doesn't work."
3,Peaceful but too ordinary,The music seems to be about the same all the way through. Peaceful should not be defined as just boring.
3,It only comes with 3 blocks!,"The toy is well made and cute and I like that it's ""green"", but it only comes with 3 blocks. I was dissapointed to find that out and would have purchased another sorter toy had I known this in advance."
2,"Good looks, didn't work with a grill","Although we left the cover up and made sure not to burn or crimp the wire this thermometer didn't work. It seriously underestimated temperature, so we returned it. It definitely looked nice though and would have been great if it worked. Maybe we just got a defective one?"
1,Taylor meat thermometer,"This is difficult to use, and though I've only used it a few times, it doesn't seem to be working, although I may be able to ""program"" it if I again read the owner's manual (for a meat thermometer?)."
1,not very good.,I bought this for use with an outdoor smoker and it was very much less than expected. very little programming ability. The little programming available is not intuitive and can easily be canceled inadvertantly. I am going to attempt to return and purchase another brand.
2,Not good for fish,"This product was not made for fish lovers, as all the predefined settings are for beef, pork, or poultry. I wish it would just have temperature settings rather than meal settings."
2,Do not use in a barbeque!,Bought this also based on the Cook's Review. It is fine for the oven as long as you don't have an oven temp over 375. Tried to use it in the BBQ and the probe burned out in 5-10 minutes. The literature states not to use over 400 degrees. What they don't tell you is that the probes burn out easily especially in a bbq.
5,thanks,"I bought the wrong item but he took it back imediately, there wasn't any problem, thanks for everything, helpfull person, clean book."
2,Dissapointing and uninformative,"For somebody who knows nothing or little about the history of Indian-white relations in America, this book would be no help. I have read extensively on this subject and was therefore able to make conclusions about what Hagan was saying throughout the book. He quotes frequently in places that don't fit and have no place in the text, he alludes to things but does not explain what he means, he mentions historical characters but does so in a way that leaves either misinformed impressions or leaves the reader clueless as to why he even mentioned them. For a book by a University Professor and in the Chicago History series, this book is a sad excuse for covering ""American Indians."""
2,What's All the Excitement About?,"This particular disc has got to be among the most hyped recordings listed under Amazon.com's classical discography. First of all, Sony does not distinguish their SACD, Hybrid SACD and regular CD recordings. Which one am I getting? I put this in my CD player and all I got was less than satisfactory sonic variation. Secondly, Volodos' interpretations come across as a jumbled mess of sounds--a clanging noise to the senses. Third, and this is a minor quibble, Sony's packaging is flimsy. The jewel case cracked in half right after I took it out of the box. This Liszt is too ""listless"" for me."
5,Judy45,I just love this series. It is just good and fun family entertainment. Angela Lansbury IS Jessica Fletcher! The casting is wonderful. Great actors who we hadn't seen in awhile.
2,"Murder, She Wrote- the complete second season","I found, out of all I have bought of this series, this one to be of bad quality with it freezing and sticking and moving slowly. I had to send it back only to get a replacement that did similar altho not as bad, and I played it on two different DVD players & it started in the middle of the Disk. I felt it was opened before, as is had no stickers on the inside disk's. I love the series and will keep it but was disappointed after all the others I have purchased. Other wise I have been happy about all the other products."
5,Sure Good to See Seth Hazlet Again,"I suppose it was because the show ran for so many seasons I had thought the doctor was in it from the beginning and was disappointed to find out he was added in the second season. I also had thought he was in every episode once he was added to the cast, overlooking the fact that when Jessica was in another state or even country for a lot of the episodes that would not be possible. Still, there were so many familiar faces showing up as guest stars. I had a great time watching cases I forgot the solution to and her involvement with recurring cast members. I intend to purchase seasons three and four this fall and hopefully be able to purchase the rest very soon after. It was of great help to Murder, She Wrote fans that all seasons were released as not all series were treated that way."
4,Great Product,"Bought this for a trip across the country in our suburban. Used it to power my wife's laptop and charge iphone at the same time. Our son watched dvd's on the laptop the whole trip, so it kept him quiet. Fan is a little loud, but definately bearable. No issues with this product."
1,What in the name is this,"I am a huge KISS fan, I have nothing against Peter, but no matter how many times I listen to this... I wonder what was he thinking. All the success and drugs must have really gone to his head. Now I love Jazz, Blues and Rock, but this album doesn't come close to being good in any of those. It has nothing to do with his drumming or voice, just plain bad writing, its too poppy and overdone, no good melodies or lyrics. Not even good music... when peter said he wanted to do an album not like a KISS album... he did it... but making a bad album... its no wonder why his solo album went on to do the worse of the 4. Its also no surprise that his later solo albums went on to do virtually nothing."
2,More bluesy than Kiss,"I've had this solo album from Peter Criss for a year or two. It's too much on the bluesy side for my tastes, but ""You Matter to Me"" is a real catchy danceable track. The keyboard line's infectious. Not the best of the solo albums."
2,Ain't no future in that rock 'n' roll.,"In September of 1978, all four members of KISS simultaneously released solo albums. This is the album by the drummer. It's not too good, in my opinion. ""That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes"" is fun, in a dopey kind of way. And ""I'm Gonna Love You"" is decent, but the rest of the album isn't very impressive. The cover version of the early-'60s classic ""Tossin' and Turnin'"" pales next to the original. But the ballads are especially bad. For members of the KISS Army only."
4,Good album but don't expect it to sound like KISS.,"This isn't near as bad as most of the reviews make it sound. It doesn't sound anything like KISS which is probably the reason for the bad reviews. Actually, I've seen Peter Criss get a bad rap on a few of the reviews of KISS albums too. Gene and Paul are the most important members of KISS but KISS was, and is, better with Peter and Ace than they ever were without them. In the 1970's, Peter did influence their music. His drumming and Aces guitar solo are a huge part of what make Calling Dr. Love and She such classics. This album sounds more like Rod Stuart than it does KISS but that doesn't make it a bad album. That just makes it different. I would rather have it than most of the CD's KISS did without Peter and Ace. Maybe it will open a few minds if people stop putting it down and actually listen to it."
4,Give it a chance!,"I cannot believe the bad press that this album receives. In my opinion it is a fine R&B record with some soul mixed in. Peter is obviously moved by a different musical muse than his co-Kiss mates. This is not a bad thing! People need to get a grip and give this record a break. Peter's cover of ""Tossin and Turnin"" was great and his song ""Kiss The Girl Goodbye"" was very bittersweet (ever heard that term applied to Kiss?) I'm not saying that we have a masterwork on our hands here, but this is hardly the 1 star dog that so many (including fellow Kiss members unfortunately) have made it out to be."
3,NOT BAD,"It is different than what one might expect from a member of KISS.This album is not bad,My favorite song is DON'T YOU LET ME DOWN,I really like the Bass guitar in it.Great Peter Criss Ballad.Peter is truly unigue."
3,The Cat Scratches Out a Cool Record...,"Some people think this record is less than purrrrfect...sorry I couldn't resist. And stacking this up against the other Kiss records from the 70's it has mighty strong company. But with an open mind - it's pretty good. I just wish there were less horns and more guitars. ""I'm Gonna Love You"" is cool and here's the point, it could be better if it was just a tad bit more rockin. I love ""Hooked on Rock and Roll"" and I could have seen Kiss doing that one live with guitars in place of the horns. ""Tossin and Turnin"" grooves nice, ""You Matter to Me"" is a cool poppy tune, but I think ""I Can't Stop the Rain"" is a true masterpiece that was overlooked. That is just a beautiful tune. But like Gene, Peter has some goofy tunes on here let's be honest...""...Sugar Papa Likes"" and ""Kiss the Girl Goodbye"" aren't so great. And there is a lot of mushy stuff too...""Easy Thing"". But, again, the diversity of the albums is what I enjoyed, and there are some very good tunes on this one."
1,No one will mistake this for literature,"Based on a suggestion by a friend (who may not be a friend after suggesting this book), I picked up BEIJING and thought that I would be transported to a place where I had never been but had always wanted to go. Instead, I was with a tour guide who was nothing more than a weepy old queen who is just looking to score. Truly sad. This book could have been so much deeper; it could have been so much more profound; it could have been tolerable. This book is nothing more than about a man who does not really discover anything of significance about himself (except that he now is attracted to ""Asians""--as if they are all the same) or about the locale he visits. This is several steps below Baldwin, James, Hollinghurst, or White, and one step above what passes for ""blue"" fiction. Philip Gambone, please do not write anything else."
5,petey's humor begins to grow,"this is a great hardcore cd from one of the founders of the brooklyn/ny scene.you have absolutly no sense of humor if you can't laugh wholeheartedly at the lyrics in this though!I was soooo mystified the first time I heard ""jd and pizza""!(quite possibly the best gothic song of all time!)laugh or be laughed at,it's your choice,and that's what steele's getting at."
4,Ashamed to Like This,"This record is really dumb, and kinda shady, although I guess no more so than SOD's speak english...Anyways, this is pretty good nyc crossover. Worth owning, but not really essential."
4,Look nice and easy to embroider,"I bought these to embroider on and they work great for that. They look really nice, make a nice gift. I think you can use them for guest towels or dish towels.UPDATE: Since I've purchased some of their other towels, I like these a lot better. It made me appreciate these a lot more. These feel a lot richer than many of the other towels I've purchased, less weave-y feeling and more cloth like. They aren't real absorbent, like for drying dishes, but for drying hands they're great and very nice looking hanging in the kitchen, or even a guest bathroom. For the price I think it's a very good value package."
4,The Romanovs: Autocrats of All Russia,"This is an excellent history book. Even though I was had to read the book in many sittings, I never lost the train of thought of the author.My only criticism is that I really wanted to learn more about Peter the Great and how he built St. Petersburg. I felt the book was lacking in this very important aspect of the history of Russia"
4,MI-5 season 4,It was quite good but I'm getting tired of all the main characters leaving or getting killed off. Is it really necessary?
5,outstanding,this series is very well written and highly addicting. once you start you can't stop. my favorite years were the 'Adam Carter' years but it is all excellent
2,MI-5 Vol. 4,"The second episode won't play all the way through.So I'm a little ticked about that. But you got it to me quick, so thanks for that."
2,New characters aren't likeable.,"Basically, the new cast is very unlikeable and unbelievable. They all look a bit too made-up and ""hollywood"" for my liking. This is what makes me despise shows like CSI and other TV Series' - the characters look like models who can't act. And that's what this has turned into. I really liked Season 1 to 3 and I liked the characters. You could imagine them being real people. These people aren't ""real people"" and they don't even try to be. They look like actors. It's hard to get into the show because you're constantly reminded that they're acting.I won't be watching any more. Pity."
4,Does the job; a bit pricey,"It's a strong clip that's able to hold my hat if it blows off in strong winds. The price was a few dollars higher than I usually can get one of these for, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to look around."
5,My Daughter Loves This!,My daughter is a Minnie Mouse fanatic. This DVD was a great addition to our collection and my daughter has watched this over and over again. Very cute songs and story.
5,Chocolate for a Teen's Soul: Life-Changing Stories for Young,"I received an advance copy of this wonderful book. It sparked my imagination for the future and revisited images of my past. Kay has once again selected excellent stories about life in the world of women. These stories portray a wealth of insight, warmth, caring, and faith. Thank you and may everyone find chocolate on their pillow each and every night."
2,Lacking,"Benny Hill fans will be disappointed. Lacks some of the better skits, and the quality of the video is lacking."
2,Where were the dancers???,"I would have appreciated a more balanced presentation of the show. This DVD just contained a series of skits. The skits were good, but it would have been nice to include some of the musical numbers. The Benny Hill Show was a 'variety' show after all. The video quality was very disappointing. If they didn't have a good enough master source, they shouldn't have released it. Overall, it was nice to see some of my favorite skits, but I didn't keep the disc."
4,Benny at his best!,"After working hard on Travel, Food and Wine stories as The Travelling Gourmet, there is nothing better to get some endorphins into my bloodstream than a hilarious dose of Benny Hill, Britain's funny man. His irreverent and bawdy humour is unmatcheable. Nothing is sacred from his jokes and wisecracks but it is all in the best possible taste. Hill's Angels are his sexy dancing girls and they can give any red blooded man a heart attack. Who needs Viagra when you can watch delicious Hill's Angels dance and frolic. If you are gloomy, don't take Prozac but watch Benny Hill and you will be happy again! Enjoy! Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet from South East Asia"
5,Guardians,"you definately need these guys in your army. if you don't (even if you field iyanden or biel-tan), your expensive units are gonna get cut to pieces without this valuable meat-shield standing in front of them. get them in range, and you've got up to 40 shots with these guys, enough to take down most anything (they gotta fail their saves some day)."
1,just how to wake the solar plexus,"This is not wroth the price. Many other books show ""how to wake solar plexus"" techuqies but this is very old and there are better ways to wake the solar plexus.thank you,dipti"
3,The thing about shark movies....,"...is that you can never tell if it's good without seeing it. It may sound good and turn out to be some cheesy ""Jaws"" rip-off. I'm going to give it three stars because Jaws 2 was the last semi-decent shark movie. (Deep blue sea was okay.) I sure hope I won't have to watch the same three shark movies over and over again."
1,poor reproduction,"The price of this book from Transaction publishers suggests a high quality paperback, but in fact it's a very poor quality reproduction; the pages look like they were printed by an ink-jet printer when it's running out of ink, with spatters and white spots. It's readable, but still a big rip-off at the price."
3,you may like it,"I don't have alot to say but this movie is funny, and you will have smile face when you watch it."
2,Unmasked and Unworthy,"From scare your parents wicked to bubble-gum cheerleaders, that is what happened to KISS by the time ""Unmasked"" arrived. The cartoon cover art is a dead giveaway. They had fallen victim to being caricatured as good clean entertainment, and the music had become less and less vital. There are exactly two good songs here, ""Shandi,"" which is as good a pop confection as any other radio tune of the day, and Ace's ""Two Sides Of The Coin,"" really the only KISS song on the album. Everything else was just sub-par generic pop metal, and KISS was never meant to be generic."
4,Unique and Underrated!,"I've been a Kiss fan for over twenty years and I remember buying unmasked when it came out. Why this album isn't more popular is a mystery. Granted it's much more poppy than a lot of Kiss albums but I'd much rather listen to Unmasked than the mid to late 80's Kiss! It stands alone with great songwriting and a guitar sound that I don't think I've ever heard anywhere else. ""Shandi"" may be one of Stanley's best penned tunes and ""Torpedo Girl"" with Ace behind the mic just rocks! Anton Fig who fills in on drums has some really nice creative work as well. Unmasked is also full of great guitar solos and riffs from Ace Frehley...and I can't say enough about the unique sound Unmasked puts forth. Check it out!"
2,GASP -- Is that you?,"OK, after Peter Criss' solo bomb...why would these jokers consider Vini Poncia as a co-writer or producer? Vini worked pretty well with them on Dynasty, but this must be their worst ever-- even The Elder is better than this bubblegum-pop with 30-seconds of flavor.Ace's songs, while not up to par with his previous efforts, are the best tracks on here. If you liked Paul's solo album, you'll probably like each of his tracks on this disc. Each one of Gene's songs are awful, and not even worth mentioning. Tracks worth sampling are Talk to Me, Torpedo Girl (the underwater version of Rocket Ride), and Is That You?"
3,Candy floss for the kids.,"I bought this, and I don't know why. All I know is that my 3 year old son just loves ""Is that You"" and sings it at the top of his voice. These are simple songs with catchy to average chorus's.Paul Stanley and Co have done better. No really they have."
3,Candly pop,"If KISS left a important fan base with the album Dynasty, with UNMASKED they confirmed as a commercial band that leveraged the rhythms of fashion to sell as many records.However, this record allowed them to devote themselves in Europe and leave to posterity such classics as ""Shandi"", ""Talk to Me,"" ""It's that You?"" Among others. If you're a KISS fan and you love disco music, you should buy it!"
3,Kiss Pop,"This is Kiss's most pop sounding album. Not bad for a pop album but not great for Kiss. Shandi,Is that you and Two Sides of The coin are the highlights but overall the album falls short of the greatness Kiss fans are used to."
4,A Great CD Recomended!,"If you are looking for good old school Salsa, I recomend that you buy this CD. Some of Hector Lavoe's best songs are on here, my personal favorites are ""Songoro Consongo"", ""El Todopoderoso"" and ""Hacha y Machete"". If you want some quality Salsa get this CD, especially if you are a fan of the late Great Hector Lavoe!"
1,Informative but not very entertaining,"CNN's ""War in the Gulf"" was not what I expected. I was hoping for an in-depth view on the aircraft and the pilots that participated in the Gulf War. The video contained little information about the aircraft or any exciting footage. Also, the running time claims to be 90 minutes, when in reality it was only 50 minutes long! If your an aircraft enthusiast, I would check out other videos because this one really didn't hold up."
4,Great Curtains for the Price!,"Just received mine in the Espresso color...like the previous reviews, two of the panels have an uneven hem, but mine puddle on the floor and no one will notice. You can't beat the price, with free shipping, and the colors are rich! I'm considering ordering more for the rest of my home..."
1,Not worth 20 bucks,"This isnt a very reliable player. It constantly shuts off, or it gets stuck on a song and I have to take the battery out just to get it to unfreeze. It is also annoying to have to go through every song to find the one you want. I would not recommend this. Sansa has much better and more reliable mp3 players."
4,Fun to read,"I'll give this one the same exact review as I did the first book: This isn't one of those books that I was sucked into and totally captivated by. It's kind of cheesy, but after all...it's Mars Attacks. It was still a very fun and enjoyable read though and I would still definitely recommend it to any science fiction or mars attacks fan."
2,Pass this one by,This book was boring behind belief i could barelyfinish but i did hoping it would get better it didnt im not dumb i can read big complex books i just read this one this for fun but it was no fun buy the first book it has more gore and is way better then this one if you still dont believe me ill tell you what its about a mongol man becomes leader of mongols and fights chinese gov. then the martain
5,Comprehensive,"Really has everything you need in a Thesaurus and more...I have used this book many times. This really has everything you need, I have used it while writing my resume and letter's to employers. This book has helped me on ALL of my technical essay's at college. When you have a 2500 word essay - YOU NEED THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Excellent volume!,Roget's Thesaurus is for anyone who is serious about writing. It is a perfect addition to one's home reference library.
5,It's growing out of my hands.,I've used this edition so much that it has now become a part of my body. I don't know what I did for word options before this but whatever it was made me look illiterate. Now I can't speak or write without this book.
4,More than a List,"After seeing Joshua Kendall speak about Roget on CSPAN, I knew I had to get another copy of Thesaurus, one with type big enough to read, and one with the complete contents. The Thesaurus is more than a great ""index"" of synonyms: it is an indispensible tool for lovers of words"
5,Disney Trading Book Reference,This is a paperback book FILLED to capacity with pins and their description. The authors do a nice job categorizing the pins and providing codes for how much the pins are worth. There is also a nice guide in the beginning explaining the history of pins and what to look for when collecting them. I've referred to it many times. It's a great book to have as a reference.
4,Excellent book for students,Republican France is one of the best books I have read in my coursework in European history. The author has the knack to discuss nuances but does not lose the reader in arcane vocabulary or irrelevant theory. What a good study!
4,What a voice!,"I just love that distinctive rasp in her voice. All the songs are really good! My favorites are ""Amor Gitano,"" ""Puro Teatro,"" and "" Como Acostumbro."" Take a listen to La Lupe - this is how singing with passion sounds like."
2,hazyboi,"Fast easy purchase and shipped quickly and correctly. However, the hinges and hasp for the lid are just bent pieces of the same molded plastic instead of seperate hardware parts. Results are a much shorter life expectancy of product. Price is low enough that its not worth returning and I gave it to my 3 year old as a toy box. Not recommended for tool box use, but okay for a kid to use as a toy box."
3,compact size,The size is nice and small but it doesn't come with any kind of tray which would be very usefull.
3,"Good, but not Great","This was certainly a fine addition to series and I can't wait for the next book. It did not however, live up to the standards of the first two books. Enjoyable and worth buying."
2,Wasn't all that it looked to be!,"This bracelet isn't what is shown in the picture. It is flat, and shinny, not as shown! You would think they could have used a better photo!"
1,"Lots of chaff...very few ""Killer Tips"" ;^(","Nice design and page layout (sorta), but there are very few things in this book that I would call ""Killer Tips"". I'm quite disappointed with this book, and feel that I've just wasted $$$ . Save your cash, or you'll get a ""Killer Pain"" in your pocketbook."
3,"eh, not bad","This book is pretty good, it provided me with some tips that i had been wondering how to do, but some of the tips were of no use whatsoever. for instance, there was one tip that asked ""are you the only user on your computer? then why do you have to log in every single time you turn it on? well, when you set up your computer, don't put a password in, that way you can just click login and you're on your way!"" This seems pointless to me, there are also other things in the book that he says are total neusances but don't really bother me at all. So, i think that it is still a useful book, but not worth 5 stars."
4,A tip or two for everyone!,"This is a terrific book for brand new users of Mac OS X, but if you're a long time user it's value falls a bit. A lot of these tips are keyboard shortcuts and other little things that you pick up just by messing around with the OS. But there are so many hidden corners of OS X that you're bound to miss a few and that's where this book comes in.The tips cover everything from the iapps, to managing the Finder, the Dock, the Classic enoronment, icons and more. There are so many tips offered, covering so many aspects of your Mac that you're bound to run into a few things that pique your interest. I discovreed the Font Panel because of this book and it has helped me so much, that it alone makes the purchase worthwile. Thats the kind of benefit this book can give. You might have to wade through a bunch of stuff you already know or don't care about but then, you run into someting that makes you jump for joy!"
2,Disappointing,"First of all, I am a diehard fan of the Moody Blues. For those of you whom are musicians, you will be disappointed. I guess it is pointless to blame the French on everything. The camera angles are horrible. Sixty percent of the views are backs, rear-end shots and scans behind amplifiers. Even a few of the songs beginnings and main focal melodies are shot with the cameras behind the artists, its an embarrassment of French filming altogether and is a confirmation never to use French in filmmaking.The band lipsynchs and it is obvious none of the instruments are actually plugged in, especially with the drummer tapping throughout the complete performance.If you would just like to ""see"" the Moody Blues during this era and learn about HOW TO NOT FILM A FAKED PERFORMANCE, this is the DVD for you, but if you expect a live and enjoyable performance of ""Knights In White Satin"", or ""Questions"", you may as well watch it from one of the archives of a TV show from that time."
1,LIP SYNCHED CONCERT....BEWARE RIP OFF,This concert is lip synched and is a very big disapointment. The only good thing is seeing all the guys together at such a early part of their career. There are a few songs where Justin sings live to the taped music. There are no cords going to the bass guitar or the 12 string and there are times you see Ray not playing the flute but you hear him playing it. And you can see John & Graham laughing through out the concert because they are no really playing singing live. THIS DVD IS A RIP OFF!!!!!!
2,You'll probably only watch it once,"A very poorly filmed show of the Moody Blues performing at a dark smokey Paris bar in 1970. This is what I would call a partially live performance. All tracks are the recorded music in the background with Justin occassionally adding fresh vocals, while lip synching to others. What was the point of this show? Surprises me that if they were at their peak then, why doesn't an English taped show or concert exist? This is a truly amaterish performance and should not have been released.The camera work here is awful with far too many shots of the band from the back, you can't see much this way. The best things are the good song list and seeing the band in their younger days ... that's all.What I would like to see is the footage of the Moody Blues performing at the Isle of Whyte concert in 1970. Bring that on.Avoid this DVD at all costs. It really is as bad as other reviewers claim."
1,In search of the lost rip-off,So sad. I have been a fan of the band for over 30 years and this DVD is horrible. This is not a live concert but rather some very bad lip-sync over the studio version.If only this was a real concert performance. I only hope the band didn't authorize this release.
4,Upholstery and Spot Cleaning Machine`,I had very poor experiences with early Bissell carper steamers- really cheap construction and they leaked everywhere. The compact Little Green line is an exception. Well sealed and easy to operate they are ideal for spot cleaning and upholstery- a must for those with pets and little kids who spill and make other kinds of more biological messes. Use the pet shampoo with it for top level cleaning. For general floor shampooing I rent the heavy duty shampooer from Home Depot for $20 every few months and shampoo my rugs using the recommended carper cleaner and a half cup of Tropical Gain laundry detergent. I find the laundry soap in the big machine is so far superior to any home unit I can buy that it is worth the trip to rent it.These little guys are great for little jobs- don't waste your time and money on the bigger ones though.
2,broke within first month,"We have had this machine 2 years and put up with the broken head that cracked after the first month. Then about 2 months ago, it stopped spraying. I guess they only make it last for the first year. I called Bissell's customer service and they said there was nothing they could do for me. Wouldn't offer a discount on a new unit. Don't bother investing in this machine if you want something that lasts."
5,Raindrip barb connector,Delivered on time and as advertised. Would purchase again. I am attempting to make this short and sweet as what more can you say about a simple drip irrigation item?
5,Amazing!,"It came in on time! When I hung it up, I realized it was more beautiful than I expected! I absolutely love this poster! I will by from this seller more(:"
5,Great book,"I bought this book. It is very good book. It is clean. Also, it comes in time. so, I thank this saller about his service."
4,"Mark Leyner: It's Love or Hate. I Love, Love, Love.","As you can see from the assortment of past reviews, people either love Mark Leyner or hate him (I wanted to use ""get him"" or ""don't get him"" but then this becomes snooty, and I'm trying to avoid snooty). He's different, what can I tell you? If you're a traditionalist who demands plot, theme and some semblence character development, you'll do better to move on past. However, if you fancy something a bit different, where the words and imagery take precedence over literature style-points, you've got to give Leyner a shot. I've found him to be especially popular with those who enjoy contemporary poetry, if that's more helpful. ""My Cousin"" was the first Leyner book I ever read and my mouth hung agape the whole way through- I never realized that anyone could get away with writing like that and be so great at it! Anyway, keep in mind, he's not for everyone, but if he's for you, you won't be sorry."
2,Wannabe,"Pseudo-hip, pseudo-funny. I thought I would like this novel, because I have liked Leyner's writing for Esquire. I was disappointed. The book tries to be too many things: beatnik, gen-x, hunter s. thompson. Instead, it has no center, and its ideas and humor are so derivative, the prose is almost unreadable."
1,Drained,"A frantic, hasty novella with no insight into the human condition as a whole, or the individual as a thinking, breathing being. Leyner is television on paper, a commercial for hiptitude, for look-at-me-I'm-cool ""literature"" that, I hope with all my heart, will go the way of greasy hair and cigarette packs rolled in the sleeves of tight cotton t-shirts. With this novella, we catch sporadic glimpses within the depths of an empty well; make that, a shallow bucket; we glean information on what it means to be vacant: emptiness. And, after two hours of reading this book, you will be drained in more ways than one."
2,No depth,"First off, the book has a disturbing amount of typos and grammatic errors. It touches a lot of subjects without really digging deep into any of them. Too many references to unexplained or poorly-explained concepts. This book isn't useful to people who have no knowledge of the subject. To those who have some web experience, it provides a laconic tutorial of the discussed subjects."
3,England Swings,"A nice piece of Nostalgia for the days of the British Invasion of birds and chaps with a lot of nude witches and suggestive dialog. The director here is Ray Austin, who worked on various Avengers series and Hammer House of Horror. He does a good job with a middle-grade script. There is a nice twist here that I was not expecting - so that was a pleasant surprise.For a good film about witches see Hammer'sThe Devil Rides Out(Also known as the ""Devil's Bride"" here in the States).Nevertheless, this is a fun film and the trailers for the Jean Rollins (sp?) films are an added bonus. However silly ""Virgin Witch"" is these other films look much much sillier."
4,Beautiful Helmet.. but,"Beautiful helmet... but be careful of removing the 2 stickers on it. The HCI sticker on the back came off easily. But then I started to take the size sticker on the side of the helmet and the leather started to come off with the sticker. So I tried to pull from the other direction.. slowly with a wet paper towel to try to loosen the glue while I pulled.. again the leather ripped a little and started to come off with the helmet. I finally just pushed the sticker back on, got a black sharpie and colored it black to match the helmet.The company needs to either not put a size sticker on the outside of the helmet or get less sticky ones."
3,Runs small,"I ordered a medium, based on their sizing chart. I even had my wife measure in various places on my head to make sure I got the largest measurement . It arrived and it looked great but It was way to small. Not even close. Had to return and reorder."
5,This is a really kewl single!,"If you like Garbage but just can't get the whole CD, you can still have the pleasure of them with this single! The new song ""Push it"" and the b-side ""Thirteen"", it's the bomb. It also includes a remix of ""Push it"", and it's really great too. This is crazy, Shirley is too wonderful! And the boys too! Rock on!"
1,Don't buy the Crosley Radio,"I bought four of these units and each one had the LCD display fail which made the units inoperable in a practical sense. The sound quality was fine, but once the LCD display goes, it is impossible to have the unit function as an alarm clock, sleep clock, change the stations, etc. A very disappointing experience and a total waste of money times 4!"
5,Masterpiece....,"Wow, deicide....What more can i say ? Well, just listing to the track ""dead by dawnn"" and i asure you'll begin to be an deathmetal lover like me! Sweet memoris!!!!Deicide rulesss!!! Deathmetal will never die! F*ck nu-metallll!!"
3,this cd needed a different vocalist,"musically this is one of the better death metal cd's i own but vocalist glen bunton's voice ruins this cd for me.the guy obviously can't sing.if this cd had a good death metal singer,it would be worthy of five stars.buy this for the music not the vocals."
5,Deicide f*cking rules !,"I own basically every album by this band even when they sign with gay ass roadrunner... I still have supported these god bashers because im a huge huge fan and will always support deicide till the day i die ! Anyways, deicide's ""deicide"" which is their debut does not dissapoint at all. If your new to dm? Start here!"
1,distgusting,"I thought slayer was distgusting. my friend wwho listens to metal said this is deth metal. if this is what ppl listen to nowadays, then they should just go be destroyed. this is horrible. it is a guy screaming and growling with that low growling thing and barking and it is terrible. and the msuic is not even muzik. they just play the guitar and hit these random notes and play as fast and it is terrible. i am christian and the lyrics are like kill the christian and i cant believe that stuff like this exists. i hope decide dies a very painful death and burn in hell like they should.this is the worst music ever. my head hurt after this. gross listen to john mayer, james blunt and coldplay for soft, good talented music. even 50 cents is better than this."
4,Full bodied tea,This tea is a good full bodied tea perfect for afternoon and evening. I will definitely order it again.
2,"THAT'S THE LADY, BUT WHERE'S HER LAMP?","The name of this book remains the sweetest part of it. I am sorry to say that Sam Wellman did not impress me with his story. The 208 pages he wrote were dull and dragging. It is a far cry from the thriller I expected. His account of Nightingale's early life was okay; but that of her later nursing career, which brought her prominence, was not well relayed. His book has a fine topic, but lacked the type of presentation I expected. I think that Val Webb did a better job in his book, (with similar title)."
5,Differences In Love,"Without question this is one of the best books I have purchased in a long time. Each story was unique, I really enjoyed each view. It made me cry, it made me laugh at other points. Through reading all that came to mind was ""I have to remember to do that. How romantic. Dang! I didn't know that was even possible."" I could really relate to these stories. I wanted so much to experience what was being described. It gave me a new view on my life. This is the path I have been searching for. This is the life I want to partake in. This is me."
2,Niche market book,"I was disappointed to discover, after having purchased the book, that it is a collection of Lesbian stories, not my style. Reading it anyway, I found the stories somewhat shallow and cliched."
4,Excellent...but,"I really enjoyed this book and getting to know the characters and the ""culture"" of this part of the USA. The religious/political elements are interesting and give a glimpse into this part of the world and reflect what I read about the USA's politics. Clare drove me a bit crazy with her stupidity and ""charging ahead"" without serious reflection as an inteligent woman would - I think. This is annoying as she is portrayed as inteligent, thoughful and with lots of experience in the past in dangerous situations but here she is sometimes stupid which doesn't seem to jive. But I will read the next book instantly!"
4,Read it on Kindle,"This is the first of Ms. Spencer-Fleming's books that I have read. I enjoyed it overall. Some slow spots, but all books do that. Recommended."
4,A Good First Novel,"Although I'm not a fan of the mystery genre, I enjoyed this first novel, and the relationship it portrayed between a single female Episcopal Priest and the older Chief of Police. The story also gave good background for Rev. Fergusson and her profession, her church, and church relationships.A good idea for a theme, beginning with the baby Clare finds, and moving one to a well-integrated web of complexity."
2,Mystery/Love Story?????????,"Sorry, I got 44% of the way through and just can't understand why the author had to make the ""friendship"" between Russ and Clare so smaltzy. When she visits him at his home, wife conveniently away, it just got too thick for me and that is when I quit reading and asked for my money back. Of course we all know that there cannot be a relationship between a married man and a clergy person sooooooo. There was really great potential for a good story but unfortunately it just didn't come off for me. A little subtlety would have helped. I don't need to be pounded over the head. It began to seem like it was going to be all about Russ and Clare and by the way there is a mystery to be solved.I blame myself for not catching on quicker, and making a poor choice. Perhaps if I had read on but I just couldn't!!"
4,"Don't let the ""Rev."" part keep you away","I am not a religious person so I know that having one of the main characters as a Reverand might keep some from trying out this great book. The Rev. Clare is not what you might expect. Smart, salty and bursting with humor she is a loveable and compelling creation. I really loved this classic whodunit mystery made over for a new generation. The plot was complex enough to keep me interested but never went too far afield of reality. Rev. Clare and the charming Chief Van Alstyne are fun to spend time with and I highly reccommend this new series!"
5,WOW,"What a pleasure to finally find a mystery of this caliber.The plotting, characters and style were without fault. A real old-fashioned ""who-dunit"" that you won't be able to put down.I am looking forward to more adventures of Reverend Clare."
4,Captures small-town setting and sense of place,"Being from a small NY town, I read this for the setting and sense of place which were excellent. But I had some problems with Clare plunging in too often and recklessly and sometimes acting childishly. Given her experience in the military and given the survival skills she demonstrates later in the book, I thought she'd be a little more cautious. That, however, wouldn't drive the plot as well as her headlong rush toward justice did."
1,Too much 'Praise',"This book started strong and the conflict/plot was a great idea, but the story failed to be a clever read, and is insulting to the reader. It becomes apparent, quickly that both the Chief of Police and the Reverand Clare are not the sharpest tools in the shed. As the story developed, I was shocked at some of the conclusions they leapt to and the silly, stupid actions the Reverand would take. I gave the book a chance, but 70% of the way through the book, the author has the Reverand run off and do something so stupid and then forces the reader to read about her stupidity for the next several pages only for the author to 'introduce' suspects and the 'killer' late in the book. The plot was poorly crafted."
4,Fun,"An engaging mystery. The writer is new to me, and I will read more of her work. Clare is a pretty cool character."
3,Not much new,"A WORLD OF HURT (2004) is the tenth book in the STARFIST series of Military SciFi stories, covering the exploits of a company of Space Marines, who are sent to various planets to put down local rebellions, alien invasions, etc.This book avoids a lot of the absurdities of the first books, but it also is missing much of the nonstop action... additionally, the off-duty life of the Marines get overly re-hashed in this book.There are some new twists inserted, involving the Skinks... and the silly ""We're Here!"" military is worth a few laughs - but, other than that, there is little new in this story, that we haven't already seen in the previous books in the series."
4,MAMA's TASTE TEST.............,"Ya know, once a cannibal, always a cannibal.Just a nasty piece of work as only the Brits can do, about Mama's quirky little habit of drilling her victims [or in that certain scene, the pitchfork to the face, or is it also the red hot poker?] to perfection! She's also a psychic........and has quuite a sideshow.Hubby dear, try as he only may, cannot get her to quit [although she's apparently rehabilitated since that piercing opening sequence]. Then there's the confused off-spring and the so-called suitors. It's disturbing to see this matron-being ""out of sorts"" - but only in Merry old England. Akin to Monty Python going Psycho for real.The 1974 posters warned about ""the Black and Decker moments"" - so be warned, this one's not for the squeamish, and graphic for the faint of heart. Talk about brainfood! This one's spread all over the place.Companions? ""Peeping Tom"" [ditto the piercings], and possibly the much earlier ""Horrors of the Black Museum"" [Michael Gough]."
2,Critique of Heart Trouble,This is one of the better books in this series. I have not finished all of them. She keeps your sttention. Her endings have suprised me.
2,Defective DTS-HD HR Recording!!!,"This is a great video to have. Great performance by the band and the audio sounds very good when played PCM or other std codecs. However, when I selected DTS-HD High Resolution the audio comes out of 4.1 channels only!!! There is NO audio coming out of the center channel!!! According to the label it is supposed to be 5.1 channels. Both my PS3 and my receiver indicate it's playing 5.1 channels. My system is properly setup and working fine because this behavior only happens with this BD. Hence, the 2 star rating.Is it isolated to this particular disc or are there others who have the same issue with this BD? If so, it might be manufacturing or production issue. If that's the case, this BD should be recalled and replaced."
3,Not for blu ray,"Don't waste your money on blu ray of this concert. The video is too grainy. I find the same on most, if not all concerts from any time more than 20 years ago. Still a decent show."
3,Mediocre,"Just not very good. Was really looking forward to viewing this, but Live Aid is a far better take of Queen's work. This video is just too dated. Not their fault, just that shows and sound have come a long way since this was recorded."
1,Defective HD DVD,Product was defective. Could not play it. Had to leave town before I had time to return it. This is my favoriyr preformance.
5,"Queen, the king of rock!","I loved every song performed by Queen. It is a great loss Freddy Mercury's death. This very special Blu-ray (remastered version) is the main gate to my old flashback times.The SHOW MUST GO ON and, by the way, WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER? That's it!"
4,Comfortable pair of shoes,"I was very impressed with the shoes. Was bought for my son who loves them,would buy another pair."
3,The rise and fall of Ace,"This is where Ace Frehley made his mark as a solo artist. This is far and away the best of the solo albums made by KISS. Rip it Out and New York Groove are terrific songs. Unfortunately, these solo albums led to the eventual decline of this supergroup. Ego got in the way of songwriting and KISS became a pop band. Ace eventually left but his efforts as a solo artist pale in comparison to this album. This is the only Ace Frehley album you will need."
4,HARD ROCK AT ITS BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Putting aside some reviewers below thaa no doubt are KISS maniacs and will rate everything they do five-stars, I must state that this ACE FREHLEY solo album is the best hard rock music you can get. Nothing less, nothing more. Except from the cover of NEW YORK GROOVE ( which repeats the chorus infinite times, then over and over again !!!!), all the tracks are killers. Ace play most of the instruments, with crack session musician Anton Fig handling the drums."
4,Best KISS Solo CD,"If only KISS had stayed in this direction, they would have been much better off. Too bad Ace Frehley didn't have the influcece to do so. A good buy."
3,"2 demerits for Scarface, etc. Trailers...","The DVD release of Animal House contains an excellent digital transfer, great sound, and ok special features, but why oh Good GRIEF WHY!? do I have to watch the trailers every time I put it into the DVD player??The movie is great, its a lot of fun, I got to see boobies and hear the curse words finally after having watched the movie edited to pieces practically every weekend of my teen years on USA or TBS, the humor still holds up and I wish I worked at Faber.HOWEVER, it's decidedly annoying to have to sit through 5 minutes of trailers without any ""out."" It is nonsense to pay for an item and then have adverts forced upon me. Sad thing is, all the titles advertised I would consider purchasing, but now, on principle, I won't.Universal Home Video, Stop doing this, its off-putting to watch trailers that are ""hardwired"" into the DVD presentation."
1,"Great Movie, Horrible DVD","I refuse to sit through advertising which can not be skipped on a DVD. And while I love this movie, I guess I will have to stick to my VHS tape. Too bad that Universal thinks they can force us to watch advertising. The worst part is, if I get a phone call half way through the movie and leave, and want to start the movie later, I have to watch the same annoying advertising again. Anytime the DVD player is turned off, it forces the advertising to be watched again. How about having those ad's as a special feature for those who want to watch them? Why force everyone to watch them?? I will boycott anything from Universal because of this."
3,An ok transfer of a comedy classic,"Let me say that ""Animal House"" is in my opinion one of the best comedies ever made. Now for the downside to the collector's edition. The video transfer is good but it's far from top-notch. With that said let me tackle the audio which is a bit of a dissapoinment. I've never heard such an overabundance of tape hiss in my life (it's so thick that you can cut it with a knife). Universal should have digitally cleaned up the audio portion of this otherwise good dvd presentation. Shame! Shame! Universal should hang their collective heads. On a final note the extra's are nice."
2,dont buy this none fixed up rehash,The blue ray picture is awfull i bought this thinking it was a fixed up remastered picture like the outstanding picture quality jaws was re-done in not by a long shot even i couldnt complain abought that one i so it must have been gooood. i thought the purpose behind all this 100 anniversery stuff was to show off thier movies in a new out standing picture quality all you get with this is a rehash of old stuff the blue ray looks exactly like the dvd and all that is a rehash of a dvd that was out a couple of years ago double secret probation. the extras on this blue ray and dvd where on that one look for that one instead. the picture quality is much better i think it was released in 2003 and a lot cheaper now.
4,Delta's Animal House,"Director John Landis could not have known what he would be starting by releasing the 1978 classic that we all know of as Animal House. The setting being on the Farber college campus, where the haughty frat house sits next door to the Delta frat house. The Delta house serving as a shelter for those such as John Belushi who was in his seventh year of college and nothing to show for it, but a less than 1.0 GPA and Hoover, played by James Widdeos, Hoover just wanted to fit in!This film is a great parody on college life, certainly those of us old enough to remember the 80's and the toga parties, can appreciate this classic. I think that Tim Matheson, as Otter and his best friend Boon, played by Peter Riegert were cast for the right characters, they too did an excellent job. I must admit, for me, it is John Belushi, 'Bluto' that steals the show! He is fantastic!"
1,Forced Advertisements,"Universal has decided to shove advertisements down our throats. Viewers CANNOT skip past the advertisements. You cannot skip to the DVD menu/title, nor can you jump to any chapters until the long previews have been completed. This is insane. Boycott this DVD."
5,One of the Funniest Movies Ever!!,"First of all I did not buy the Double Secret Probation Edition DVD of this film because #1 it had nothing more on it than my 1998 Collectors Edition had and #2 my 1998 version has the Original movie Soundtrack including the dont know much about history song when Bluto is having his Lunch, so i will keep my edition, if you are a purest and want the very best version (on dvd) then try to find the out of Production 1998 dvd, you will have to pay a higher price but it is worth it to get the original movie as it was meant to be, if you don't care about the originality of the music then buy the new version, it is cheap and easy to find."
1,"Don't buy this DVD - mandatory, unskippable ads","I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option. Universal thinks I should watch several ""previews"" - (translation - advertisements) prior to watching my new DVD (that I paid for).The ads cannot be skipped, cannot be stopped, you can't hit ""menu"" to get to the main menu. A complete joke, and an insulting slap in the face to everyone who BOUGHT the DVD instead of downloading it.I suggest you avoid this DVD. There is no point buying, it just encourages Universal to make more DVDs with more unskippable ads. The copy I bought will be returned to the place of purchase. If they won't give a refund, perhaps Universal will. If they refuse, maybe they'll see us in small claims court."
5,great,awsome movie and beleive it or not kind of hard to find. I got it at a great price cheaper than anywhere else I bet. :)
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!,"The mere fact that Universal is pounding down LOCKED advertisements and commercials down your throat before you can actually start watching this movie is absolute TORTURE. I have not purchased a single Universal DVD/Blu Ray since. They could have at the very least permitted us to fast forward or skip these nauseating ads. A TOTAL let down in every meaning of the word. You SUCK Universal - FIRE your Advertising ""genius"" before you lose any more business! Losers...."
5,Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga!,John Belushie from SNL delivers one of the best preformences ever i love this movie.
3,A great film ruined,"Yes, they removed all the original, and classic, music from the film. When I looked it up on the internet - it happened for copyright reasons apparently.Although the film is still great, the lack of hit music from that period really robs the movie of its charm. This was always a madcap comedy, but it is also a sweet and touching film. The characters are such great fun and it is still sad to see John Belushi at the height of his comedy powers when he was just making his big break.A classic, that has been tragically mauled for the DVD release."
5,my private review mach 5,"I 1st saw this movie in 1980 and its hilarious john belushi gives a greatest performance, i liked it"
3,"A classic movie, but a poor transfer to the DVD media...","What can you say...classic Belushi in what was a hit comedy when it came out. However, the film did not make the jump to DVD without some problems. It appears the studio had a less than prestine master copy from which to master the disk- sound quality is OK at best, and there are several occasions of severe pixelization where the digital sampling of the analog movie somehow got hosed up. Still a good movie, just don't expect to use this one to show off how great DVD is as a home movie format...."
1,Infuriating previews - boycott Universal,"DVDs that force one to watch previews are among the biggest annoyances of modern life. I seldom put in this DVD, simply because I know I'll be forced to sit through the same previews again. Universal, the company that made this, should seriously consider that it's creating all sorts of anger among customers, and that people subjected to this idiocy will go out of their way to avoid the company's products in the future (I plan to boycott Univeral's DVDs until this practice is changed). If it realizes this, it will remove previews from its offerings - they're sure to hurt its profits more than help. As for me, I'd like a refund, please."
3,Very Poor Sound,"(I'll assume most people reading these reviews know (and like) the film itself - this review pertains to the DVD)Lousy sound mixing! The levels are ridiculously inconsistent - one minute I'm leaning close to the TV to make out the dialogue, and the next my poor neighbors are picking plaster out of their soup. This does not just occur, for instance, when a song beings - the sound level changes occasionally in the middle of a scene, a song, or a line.I think the subject of the unstoppable previews has been adquately covered, but I'll emphasize anyway: May death come quickly to the person who made that decision! My Blockbuster rentals can have adverts - fine. If, however, I purchase a movie, I should be able to watch is as I bloody well please."
3,"Movie is Awesome, this dvd is the pits",The copy I got must have been an ealy effort in putting film movies to dvd. The picture is horrible. Has all the specks an blemishes that are normally present in a film movie.Get this dvd if you love the movie. Just don't expect the picture quality you are used to having with dvd.
4,Realistic Humor,If you went to college and were in a fraternity (or sorority) this film is great to relive those fun days. I could not stop laughing.
1,cheated by amazon,i was cheated by Amazon because the product site say the bluray have PORTUGUESE subtitles and so when i get it ..surprise!!!!! de disc dont have such subtitle...so what now Amazon????
2,did not care for it!,"The commentary did not agree with the bible as to where the Israelites crossed the Red sea as it was described as a very shallow mound they walked acrossto flee the Egyptians, and the biblical account says all Pharoah's army drounded,(in three feet of water??) I dont think so. It did, however show Mt. Sinah in the correct place."
1,Doesn't work and it hurts bad,"I received this product as a gift. After using it, I felt people needed to know a couple things about it. First, I could not hold the Thermaclear on my face for more than 1 second because it hurt so bad (it felt like I was being shocked)! Afterwards, I found out through a USA Today Article that it heats up to over 200+ Degrees (not safe!)! Needless to say, it did not get rid of my pimple (it got worse) and I had a red mark on my face for over a week. I do not recommend this product."
2,"Even at 50 Pages, Could Have Been More Concise","The 10% Solution isn't a horrible book. But even at a mere 50 pages, I felt like it ignored its own advice as to how to create crisp prose. The book starts off with maybe 25 pages worth of backstory - which might matter if I cared at all about the author. But I don't, so I honestly don't care how he came up with his solution, or why it's worked so well for him. I just want the goods.The goods themselves are composed of a list of about 15 rules, which the author then padded out to 25 pages. Are the rules helpful? Definitely. But you can find them in other books that include style advice along with ""rules"" like ""omit adverbs"", ""use shorter words"", etc."
1,"10% solution, 90% bluster","This pamphlet is not ready for commercial release. It is filled with poor grammar and questionable logic. If the author truly knew how to cut unnecessary text, he would have reduced these 64 pages to half that amount. Yet even then it still wouldn't cover any topic that isn't already addressed far, far better in William Zinser's ""On Writing Well."""
1,This book is just not helpful at all...,"As an antique doll afficianado & collector, I need accurate information. Seems like this book was just thrown together to tap into the doll collectors' market, without any sense of real knowledge about antique dolls. Some info on the dolls is inaccurate or wrong. Typos. Scant and superfluous text. I do not get the sense that this author has a love for dolls nor a true knowledge to share with doll afficianados.I say, save your money."
4,DOCTOR DOLITTLE'S CIRCUS,"Hilarious fourth Dolittle story has the good-natured vet once again joining Blossom's Mammoth circus to exhibit a freak animal called the pushmi-pullyu,and while doing so,rescues a seal from captivity.Great fast-paced children's writing, though it may not have some your favorite characters from the first three books.Kids will love the ending.It is hard to understand why such a good book should be out of print."
2,Interpreting Revelation,"It is a very informative book; however It is writen more for an advanced scripture student. I was looking to use it as a Bible study. I have found it helpful in preparing to teach my class, but not to use it as the study guide for the students."
1,Damaged goods,"I received a 3.5mm stereo coupler in the mail that was damaged. I was initially excited while opening my package, but I soon realized that I was unable to insert an extension cable into one side of the coupler. Upon further examining it I noticed that there was a piece of plastic that was wedged inside. I am thoroughly disappointed, and unfortunately at this point it wouldn't be feasible for me to send it back for a refund because I would loose money on the postage."
4,It was what I needed,I have a little projector and I wanted to hook up the sound to our camper speakers and needed a long cord to make it happen. I have the two cord and the coupler worked great.
1,Not Even Worth the Small Amount That I Paid,Produces a strange crackling sound when used. Tried with multiple peripherals and had same problem on all of them. Not sure what type of metal is used but not designed to conduct sound properly.
4,Great product,The 3.5mm coupler works perfectly fine. I have not had any problems connecting it to me headset. I use it to connect my headset to my TV for Xbox live. Plus you can't go wrong with the price. The shipment was pretty fast and within the excepted date. Overall this is a good product.
2,Intermittent connection.,"Maybe ok for stationary use, but tends to cut out if the connecting plugs twist during use with a portable player."
5,Inexpensive but not cheap,"The cost of these was extremely low so I bought about 10 of them, although they were so cheap, they weren't exactly ""cheap"". The quality isn't low caused by the low price. Very good for such a low price."
4,the good the bad and the crazy,"after reading insatable i didnt think her writing could be better but ms. hobbs has done it again this book was very good i couldnt stop reading other than work,this book was very good these twins was something esle . keep up the good work"
4,Angels on Earth,Beautiful story about Love and forgiveness. This story shows how small deeds can change a persons life forever. Loved Brad and Michelle
5,A Fascinating Voyage Through the Night,"A succinct but fun review of common night sounds. Excellent audio, and the narration is just enough to keep the entries from being too ""rapid fire"" and boring. I imagine children would also find the CD engaging to listen to in the car. If you have purchased other Lang Elliott audio compilations and found them too ""disjointed"" (ie-just a name and sound), this is the better alternative due to slightly more narration that lends the feel of a true ""tour"". The selections are for very common animals that are not esoteric or regional, so inevitably you will end up smiling and muse, ""So, THAT is what I heard on my walk last week!"" I do not know Lang personally, but the CD emits the vibe of a well crafted labor of love and appreciation for nature."
2,Not a value,"The author's interpretations of many described historical events are exceptionally biased and most of the given references are outdated. The book suffers from a rather strange for an encyclopaedia presentation style (language), very low quality of illustrations and an unfortunate choice of alphabetical listing of topics."
4,Sparking collection,"As the other reviewers stated, this book is nothing at all like her other(magnificent) book Possession, either in style or subject, but Byatt's intensely clear and lyrical voice still comes through in this glowing collection of stories. I didn't like them all-""Crocodile Tears"", the first and longest, is especially difficult to wade through-but of those I did like, mostly ""Cold"" and ""A Lamia in the Ceveness"", provide all the depth and warm, rich complexity that I've come to expect of her, and gave me the feeling of sinking deep into a world of water and light, as she deals with isolation, the battle between art, talent, and reality, and the contradictory nature of love, weaving a fairy-tale like spell. Not perfect, with the variation in the stories, but not to be missed."
2,Great Writer Perhaps Merits More Tasting,"Having never tasted of the nectar of Byatt's writing, I decided to test the waters with this small book containing shorter works. After an initial thrill of her writing in the opening story, ""Crocidile Tears,"" wowed me with her style and writing, althought disappointed by the climax and resolution of the story, I turned anxiously to the other offerings and was disappointed. The writing was still exquisite, but the story's lacked plot and resolve. I have not given up on Byatt, as she is highly rated and may be an acquired taste. I just haven't acquired it yet!"
5,Doesn't Disappoint,"I have read several novels by A. S. Byatt, but this is the first book of her short stories that I have read and it did not disappoint. She is an intelligent, unique writer. You always get more than you bargained for when you open one of her books. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Skillfully crafted, but curiously cold","Like Byatt's previous collections, this book is a well-written quick read with gorgeous visual imagery. Its focus is how characters negotiate extremes--of emotion, of circumstance, of temperature and more. But for a book subtitled ""Stories of Fire and Ice"" there is very little passion; and I felt little emotional engagement. The writing is exquisite, but the emotional life of the characters is not fully realized."
5,Great gloves for women!!!,"I SOOO love these gloves! It's so hard for women with small hands to actually find a product that fits, let alone has a low price and great quality... These are keepers!!"
3,monster doodle,"got 2 of these last Christmas for my oldest grand-children-they don't play with them, so guess this was a flop"
5,Ambient Stand Out,"This album makes it to the top of my ambient music collection. It even replaces Ishq ""Orchid"" which held the #1 position since August 2004. If you are looking for an instrumental ambient CD that you can relax to or take a mental journey with, this is the one. I sometimes put the headphones on at work to block out the co-workers and listen or pop it in the CD player on the way home to unwind.My favorite tracks are 14:31, 9:39, and 12:18. The liner notes reveal that the band didn't want to bias your listening experience by naming the tracks. Definitely a sentiment I agree with."
4,Good summer read,Super summer read as one in a series or similar story lines. I live in New England and it is pleasurable to hear about the eastern seaboard and know where the places are in the book.Bought them all.
3,A good crystal reference book...,"I do have to agree with the previous reviewer, in that the book lacked direction and motivation in the beginning pages; but the Stone Encyclopedia included in it has been a great asset to me in finding quick information about certain stones. A valuable book for a collection, but I would recommend it only as a reference tool."
5,Surprisingly enthrawling with a flare of pure excitement!!!!,I started this book with the idea that it was a book about the past that would simply serve as a History lesson. WOW was I wrong. What a History lesson I got!!! The author got inside of my head and planted visions of the characters and their surroundings. For three days (thats all it took me to read it because I couldn't put it down) I lived with the characters.I began to think of them as real people and became enthrawled by their lives and the drama surrounding them. I began to look at my everyday life in a whole new way. Great read!!! Recommended!
1,what a piece of junk,"this does NOT have a ""solid pine cabinet"" anything..... it is a metal or something-under-wood-like-wallpaper-covered-outer-doors exterior.....this does not have one piece of wood in it.......and the doors do NOT close...the magnets don't catch and the ""door knobs"" that came for it did not have any screw threads so we had to use gorilla glue to hold them on the outside....of course we really don't need the knobs since the door constantly swings open, on their own and the knobs are, therefore, useless.......plus the ""heckler option"" does not work - AT ALL........we are at a loss for a replacement, since we are having a big party this weeekend and have no time to re-order a better model,or even a replacement piece of junk!!!do i sound upset....gee i wonder why....i have ordered from amazon for years and have never run into an item that was so mis-represented.........""disappointed"" is a kinder, milder description........"
3,Cornerstone Blues Jam 1992,"My review is a mixed bag. I like Larry Howard, Glenn Kaiser and Darrell Mansfield when they have worked together. This recording sounds over-baked and way too busy for my taste. A better record in my opinion to own is Brush Arbor's Live/Centerstage."
2,doggie door,I like the looks of this door but it is not as sturdy as the other one I have. This one is plastic and when the dogs run through it alot they end up pulling the flap out and I have to take it apart to put it back. My other door is metal so I think it holds better.
1,"A very theory based book, with very little absolute Truths","For Starters, on page 24, his process of theory has many falts. He leaves his process wide open to be applied to many other scriptures, especially to homosexuality. I recommend looking for authorities who have solid exegesis/doctorine as the bible test us to have.In page 27 this author takes way the divinely given scriptures by attesting that certain passages were given because moses wanted it, not GOD. I seriously question if the man actually knew or in fact believed in Jesus Christ."
3,Royal Defeat,"I agree with the reviewer who thought of this as a comedy. It really is kinda humorous. Certainly not what you would expect from ""Hamlet"". If you have low expectations and enjoy watching the usually talented cast- go ahead. The sauna scene is no big deal. Don't get your hopes up. The women are well padded; dimpling and all. The best scene is when Gabriel Byrne grins from ear to ear and looks real mental. He rarely grins in other films! Darnit."
1,From the opening credits,"featuring cookie-cutter travel log footage of Scandanavian scenery to the very last scene with 30 exhausted extras shouting ""God Save the King"" at three better than average actors standing ill at ease on a wooden platform, it was all pretty disasterous.I knew that it was a no go at the first syllable of the ""narration."" Instead of showing us the murders of Amleth's father and brother, we were told about it. Instead of showing us the horror and mystery of Amleth's father's ghost appearing to him and telling him of his uncle's treachery, we were told about it.The poor actors were given almost nothing to play. I imagine that they were pining for Shakespeare's genius for writing superbly playable scenes and dialog. He would never have left his actors so stranded.The story and the actors deserved far better. What a total waste of celuloid."
4,Helen Mirren,"She's a great actress. And she has a real-woman beauty rare by Hollywood standards.But the most important thing, unmentioned by other reviewers, is that she takes a sauna. Worth the price of admission. If you're in to that sort of thing, that is."
2,Forget this one!!!,Even though Christian Bale is in this movie---just forget it. The movie is very slow and the plot changes all the time. Very fake settings and boring. Christian Bale is the highlight in this one but skip it anyway.
5,CD Title Printer,I'm very pleased with the Casio Title Printer. It's very user friendly and does a great job. The price can't be beat.
3,Had a problem with the ribbon advance,I really like the idea and the quality of what I did get printed was fine..however I couldn't get the CW-50 to pick up the ribbon slack as it was being used. Tried 2 ribbons and no luck. Am trying to return and retry.
2,IT JAMS ALL THE TIME - 2nd one I've owned,"This is the second one I've owned and I gave up trying to repair the first one. After the warranty period, the thing starts to jam part way through the cycle forcing me to take off the bottom (I now leave the screws out) and cycle it through by hand to clear it so I can remove the disc and start over. Big PITA but alternative products are way more expensive. Casio should be ashamed for selling this piece of crap. I've considered modifying it when I have time to operate it manually. Hope their engineers read this and look into it."
3,Replacement wires,I have not had to use these replacement wires yet as the cheese cutter came with three replacement wires and I have not had any problem with the one that was installed on the unit.
5,Great replacement wire,"The original wire on my cheese slicer broke receently and I had no idea what brand the marble block was. This wire fit perfectly and the instructions were clear. After 30 seconds, it was on and I was slicing away.Delivery of the product was prompt and fairly priced."
4,Organic Dandelion Tea,I enjoy drinking this but don;t know what it is really doing for me. I used two bags at a time for more flavor.Judy
1,Not what you would hope for,"The small chapter in John Murphy's classic on technical analysis is a better introduction than this book. I was looking for something beyond that, and was disappointed not to find it here. The book contains mistakes, charts without discusion, no help in identifying wave patterns, and 40 useless pages for glossary, outdated websites, newsletters, etc. in a book that is only 144 pages. Most of the book contains long quotes from other books, but nothing to offer on its own."
4,"nothing in-depth, but great photos, overviews of habitats","My son prefers reading a few pages out of this to reading bedtime stories. It goes through all different habitats and has tidbits on animals that live there. Each page has beautiful photographs and a smattering of factoids. The introductions to each habitat provide some good basic science. If you are looking for the kind of encyclopedia where you look up a topic and read an article, this is not that kind. It is more a scientific picture book for browsing. Even reading outloud is a bit challenging because you are generally not reading paragraphs, but a collage of captions and labels. It is similar to other DK Science or Usborne Science books in that way. None of this keeps it from being fascinating to the children. It is very visually stimulating."
1,Don't waste your $$,"Didnt cover any of my tatts, from red to black to purple.I will just have to wear boots and long sleeves"
2,Terrible sizing,"These gloves were bought for treatment for eczema, so I could put an abundance of cream on wrists and hands then go to bed. The wrist length is way too short and the wrist opening is too large and does not sit snug on the skin/wrist, therefore making these gloves useless to protect the wrists over night wear. Maybe if you just want cream on your finger tips and palms of the hands they might work for you, but you will not have any protection at all for your wrists. I have not worn them yet to see if they stay on all night, as they are useless for what I need them for."
1,Good Seller - Low Quality Gloves,"The seller is great to work with.That being said, the quality of these particular gloves is not very high in my opinion. They are thin and cheaply made. They do not look like they would hold up to more than a couple of hand washings at best.According to the seller the fabric has been changed on the Spa Sister 100% cotton white gloves.The seller settled with me in a satisfactory manner."
1,Just awful,"These gloves are thin thin thin, with very long fingers and a very tiny palm. The minute I put them on, I felt like my joints were constricted and the space between fingers was far too small. Don't bother with them. They wouldn't last a washing, either."
3,Shrunk,"These gloves have shrunk with washing. They fit my hands now, but they're so short around my wrists that I have trouble keeping them on."
4,Good gift idea,"I purchased these for my daughter. She said they work really well and she wears them every night and notices a difference in her hands, especially during dry winter months."
4,Spa sister gloves,I have Raynauds syndrome and I use these gloves to help keep my fingers covered. They make great glove liners. I dye them black or brown. These gloves are great while typing.
4,Operation Doom!,"Operation Doom is a good compilation. Very enjoyable but not the ""best"" episodes (in my opinion). Well worth the price and if enough of these are sold there is a good chance that Nickelodeon will bring Invader Zim back. Episodes are not in order as they were aired though... no big deal. Buy it!"
5,I am ZIM!,"Ahhh, I'm soooo happy I got this now. ^_^ My poor disc broke years ago, and the picture on the box amuses me to no end as well. xD"
2,Poor quality two times around,"The first unit was riddled with obvious defects in the surface (painted over chips and dents in the wood as well as chips that went through the paint) and the replacement unit they sent was similar, so it appears to be a basic low quality issue. The doors in both were also slightly warped so they stick out unevenly - from the two packages we could not put together one really good buffet.Also, another key problem is that the unit when assembled is not solid/sturdy and it goes off square easily; this causes the doors to hang really lopsidedly and gap.The only good things I can say about it is that nothing arrived broken, and the customer service was responsive. In the end though their efforts did not help, since, as I said, the replacement unit was just as bad if not worse then the original."
1,"A collectable, not a toy by any means","The seller was great. The (toy) is not a toy, its an extremely fragile collectable which I broke in 3 places getting out of the box because its so fragile. I would never have bought this for my child who cried because she cant play with them. This should be stated by the product. It reads not for ages under 3, I am 34 and broke it getting the tape off."
4,A better keyboard,"A truly better keyboard, with best kind of mechanism.A bit noise for my sensitivities. But I can live with it.The writing on the white keys is the easiest to read that I have seen.Mark"
4,ahead of his time,"this little book was compiled from lectures given at the University of Waterloo in 1978. I read it shortly thereafter. It has profoundly shaped my perspective on the role of the church in society. we are leaven, a sacrament of the coming kingdom of God, not architects of a new theocracy."
1,bad quality wire,"At first it works good. I've owned mine for about 2 weeks and the sound quality is terrible, I need to go buy a new one already. Save yourself some time and just get one that doesn't cost $.01"
1,Two duds,"The company killed 1 sale with 2 duds (not 2 birds with 1 stone).I bought two of these. The first one I unwrapped didn't work out of the box. It was very glitchy and would cut out if I touched it wrong. The sound quality didn't exist, obviously.The second one was better....for 3 days, then it started doing the same thing. The company offered to replace, but wanted me to ship it and pay for shipping which would cost more than I payed for these. Some deal."
4,Work Great,"I have no complaints about this product, it was cheap, shipped in a timely manner, and works perfectly with my Nook and EVO 4G :-)"
3,"Sounds good, man.",This is a cheap stereo that produces some nice sounds. I have it hooked up to my TV to computer speakers and it sounds great. Only 1 problem: static. I sometimes hear static when watching the tube.
2,"Good for beginners, little for experienced players","This is excellent for beginners, curious about the evermore visible world of SM. By putting a softer edge on the subject, Ms Payne removes much of the stigma attached to SM, making it more palatable for a mainstream audience. If Cosmo or Mademoiselle were to write a serious book about SM, this is what I would exzpect to be the result. Ms Payne, a self described ""Avid SM Hobbyist"" is not a professional dominatrix, she is however the Martha Stewart of SM.Seasoned veterans of the SM scene however will find little in this book that they didn't already know. Most basic SM texts are far more advanced than Ms Paynes offering. If you've been around the dungeon for a couple of years, the best use you'll find for this book is as a gift to your curious vanilla friends."
3,clever book for the aspiring female dominant,"I liked this book. The author is witty (sometimes catty) but keeps it interesting. I even fell for her little quiz. It has some great how-tos in it, some personal advice from her own experiences, and some important safety tips too. I would have given this work four stars if it were longer. I'd love to see this author come out with a sequel to this work. She covers all the necessary points of what a dominatrix does/tries to do. She even teaches how to tie different knots. So ladies dont worry about forgetting what you learned in the Girl Scouts! She covers it here for you."
5,Great Book,This book has really struck me at my Heart and Soul. I am starting to reread the book again. Something made me think about my life and this Life (BDSM) and how I had kind of lost where I was. Now after reading this book I got it Back. I Been so humbled by this book. I can't say enough good things about itJames (Wolfie)Sex Tips from a Dominatrix
2,Practical tips for someone who would be a professional domme,"This book offers tips such as makeup, decorating, knot tying, traveling, equipment, safety, etc. It does not offer insight into actual scenes to play."
2,Over Priced,Why do I need another cork screw. Doesn't everyone in the world have at least one? What I need is something to preserve the unused portion of wine that I want to save for another day. The Vacu Vin Wine Saver Gift Pack is just the thing for that. It's easy to use and very very effective. I give it 5 stars. Spend your money wisely.
2,If you want a starter guitar...,"This guitar is decent if you are getting it for a starter/beginner... experienced players should avoid this guitar. I've had the more expensive version and got this one afterwards, and there is a dramatic difference in quality/playability. The tone, feel, and quality are just not worth it if you can save a few more hundred dollars for the LTD or Edwards version. Aside from the quality of materials used to make this guitar... the tone is nothing special especially if you have been playing for a bit! Save your cash if you are an experienced player... newbies, HAVE AT IT!"
4,Great Book,"Most are familiar with her other work 'A Raisin In The Sun', but this work gives insight to the personal side of the author exposing her deeper thoughts. The format of the book is slightly different in that in between her personal writings are snippets from her productions, it can through you off at first but overall it complements the tone of the book. A truly gifted mind that died far too young, if she had lived, there would be even more of her classics available today."
5,Fred is a truly gifted in faith and vision,"He's done it again. I'm never disapointed with his music. He cna keep your head bopin' and he can bring you to tears all on the same album. His music is so personal and diverse. His sound is unique and his vocal quality only gets better with time. I'm an long time listener. I've been listenting to Fred for 18 years! He is my favorite artist across ALL genres of music. I honestly can't rank his albums one behind the other, they are all first quality and ranked #1 to me. I saw Fred in concert in February in Kalamazoo MI. (drove 200 miles to see my boy!) and it was well worth it. His personality shines right through in his music. This record is appealing and honest. If you like Fred, you'll love this one. Click 'BUY'!"
5,"Stay with this style of worship, Fred!","I love, love, love this CD and can't get enough of it! It's been a while since I could say every last song on a CD is dynamic and heart-touching; that's definitely the case with this one. It's been out for some years now, but its message will forever be relevant. These songs and their style of delivery are Fred Hammond's specialty and he should never stray from this, ever. ""Get back to what God has called and anointed you to do with your music ministry, Fred. Please don't put this much needed bright light under a bushel. I thank God for you!"""
4,Good long ride music,"I personally felt that this album by Fred wasn't the most lyrically strong as far as puting out that solid christ message he's done in the majority of his previous cd's, but I love the mellowness of the album. I'm in love with neo-soul and him teaming up with musiq soulchild and taking that soulful approach, I feel, was a risk he succeeded at. When i first got it I listened to it repeatedly then chose my favorites. If you're looking for that RFC sound, wrong album choice, but I absolutely LOVE this cd."
5,Awesome album,"I grew up listening to Fred with Commissioned and his first two solo projects. They were very soulful and urban. I was kind of disappointed when he left commissioned and formed a choir because I knew that would be the end of the urban Fred I'd come to love. So this album takes me back to the Fred I use to love. You've still got those choir, praise songs in there. But it's nice to hear fred do his own bgvs again.So if you love commissioned, and Fred's first two solo projects, then this is the album to get. Though this one has mainly a Neo-Soul feel to it. He even has the Neo-Soul artist, Musiq on two tracks. But all in all, very good album."
4,Good Basic VCR,Has all the basic features that you need in a VCR. Worked fine so far.I have always liked Panasonic for its reliability.
3,"Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, GO!","This is an affordable, capable little VCR. Like the other reviewers, I do wish it had auto-tracking and a better ""time remaining"" counter but it does the job and records about as well as a 30-50 dollar VCR can.And, man, when they say FAST FORWARD they aren't kidding. This VCR's fast forward and rewind are FAST. I'm talking Tasmanian Devil fast. I'm saying you might cast a cautious eye toward your VCR if you're rewinding a tape because when this sucker gets to work, it sounds like it's about to lift off and blast right through the ceiling. That's good when you want to skip around on a tape, but it makes scanning through commercials tricky work. I wish the ""play"" were as fast as the ""scan"" because I always over- or under-shoot it when I'm trying to stop at a specific point."
2,OK until it broke,Parmesan cheese demanded a lot of effort. Mozzarela cheese was hard to clean. The molded plastic has a compartment that gets grungy and can't be cleaned. After a year the handle broke off. Why can't someone make a rotary cheese grater that doesn't break?
5,Pedrini Pleasure Rotary Grater,"This is the best cheese grater I have ever owned. It does the hard cheeses as well as most others graters, but it does an absolutely wonderful job on soft cheeses like mozzarella."
1,Fell below my expectations,"I had hopes for this book. I was expecting it to be like Don Norman'sThe Design of Everyday Things, but I was left disappointed. It is basically just a collection of papers, most of which are based on more concise version of papers that appeared in the American Behavioral Scientist 45(3), which is freely available to students and academics with the right privileges. It's a beyond being paid for on an individual basis, but I found my library's copies ofSocial Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applicationsby Subhasish Dasgupta a more comprehensive edited work for the contemporary age of social networks on the Internet. If you're a student you can always get it by Inter-Library loan if your library doesn't have it, or ask your them to buy it as it's well worth reading - it is more up-to-date than this dated work, which is basically available online anyway."
1,Don't Do It!,"If you are the type of person that needs a study guide, get the free one from NYSTCE's website. Don't waste your money on this! It is unclear and not nearly as helpful as the free one NYSTCE offers. Good luck studying, and save your money!"
4,Good Book for Beginners,"This is an excellent book for beginners who want to know more from the conceptual view what Interdev is all about. For a hard-core programmer, I highly recommend Interdev Unleashed(99 ed.)"
2,Too many errors,The author tried to make the concept simple for beginners. But the amount of errors in the sample code is unbeliveable!
1,A total waste of money.,"I have bought quite a number of Sams Teach Yourself books in an attempt to, well, teach myself various technologies and this one ""takes the biscuit"". Very little works in this book, not even the updates. It has left me totaly frustrated and has diminished my confidence in anything ever published by Sams again."
4,Dub Nation Please Rise,With this CD you will get one of the greatest dub experiences ever. Just pop this into your cd player and let it carry you away to a mixture of a light drum n bass..with some ambience feel to it..and definitely the bass pounding in your ear. Which does actually lives up to it's title. Dub n bass. Dub nation please rise and clap for this fine album. If you like dub or wish to get to know it better..this is definitely the cd to start by or a must have.
1,Where was the editor?,"While I agree with much of what Peterson so enthusiastically preaches and have read many of his favorite sources, I found myself hating the book. This book calls out more than any book I have ever read for a rigorous editing. It is hard to believe it was not self published. This book lacks a thesis and is poorly organized. Worse, Peterson's vocabularly is often curiously wrong and his writing style is perhaps best described as ugly. Further, it is hard to get through a paragraph without one or more parenthethical interruptions -- he even uses parenthesis inside of parenthesis! Instead of bothering with this book, read A HUNTER'S HEART (some great essays which Peterson edited but thankfully did not write) and Meditations on Hunting by Jose Ortega Y Gassett."
1,didnt like it,"i found this novel to be lacking...something. something important. it seemed so TEDIOUS to me! i actually put it down w/o finishing it, & plan to donate it to a used book store. i did not find it humorous, it was boring. granted, i did not get more than 20-30 pages in, but sometimes, you just cant get into a book. you might like it, i didnt. i didnt feel it was particularly well-written, & seemed on the mundane side to me. yes, that was it"" mundane. if you want a funny fiction novel, something completely not serious & with ridiculous characters, plot & situations, try carl hiaassen's work, & if you like sci-fi fantasy comedic novels, try the discworld series. this herding cats book was definitely disappointing. sorry i spent the money on it & on shipping. perhaps if i had kept at it, it would have gotten better, but it is just not my style."
4,The Zahir,Book has been the topic of much discussionwith my friends. On the one side it is about obsessionon the other it may be a cover for one's actions.Another great read by this greatwriter.
1,A Spiritual Rape,"This last novel from Coelho actually deserves no star at all.The books that came before this one, are all stellar novels, to the extent of being instant classics - genious at times.This one, however, is nothing but what the title says; a spiritual rape of the reader.Coelho claims many things in this book - amongst them, that he has found the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Which we all know to be 42... and Coelho's explanation makes just as much sense as Adams'.High-flying, lacking a storyline - and a plot, self-righteous and bragging besserwisser-ness pollute this book like a leak from a broken sewer-pipe, killing whatever joy I had for this writer and his books from the outset.The bottom line is, that it's not the worst book I've read, but it's bad, and it's definately the most disappointing book I've ever read."
5,Masterpice,"I think that this is ""The Book"" of P. Coelho. Very mature writing. A book for everybody to understand. Dealing in a special way with usual situations most people face in an everyday life.With some drops of cynism...I read it twice!!!"
4,A nice novel to read... an excellent one to make you think,"I didnt know if I was reading Paulo's personal story or my personal story. I think what is great about Paulo's novels is that it gives me time to stop in the middle of this busy life, and think about myself, my past and future. Therefore I recommend this for you.One star less than perfect, because it could have been better."
4,Another Paulo Coelho added to my collection,Wonderful transaction. I was very happy with the condition of the book. I would recommend this seller.
2,the Zahir,"A slow-moving, pretentious novel. The main character is arrogant and unbearable. Throughout the entire book, my feeling was who cares? And, to the author, just tell me your message. It could have been said in one sentence. I don't need a boring story to get your point."
5,I agree! Excellent movie!,"I have read through the previous reviews and I agree - I want more! The cast fits together so well, from Kerendi(sp?) to Valentine to Tyburn and the stories are all so well written and acted that I hated to see them end. I especially loved the friendly romance taking place between Tyburn and Harker which culminates in simply a kiss at the end of the movie - not some steamy love scene. Some people may think PBS is boring but I found this movie very exciting and have seen it both times my local PBS station aired it. It is well worth the money if you love a good mystery that makes you think and like a good group of characters that fit together well."
5,Complete and informative,"Noel Rowe's book on the primates of the world is a solid reference and extremely well organized. There are many photographs of rarely seen species, and to have them all in one place makes this a great sourcebook. The writing is clear and concise. Highly recommended."
1,pasta machine,"I ordered and returned this item twice. I was under the impression, I was ordering a new./ never used product. Both times the item was used, not completely cleaned with some visible rust spots, and a piece missing. I have returned it and ordered elsewhere."
3,Not Fleischman's greatest work,"I haven't read all of Paul Fleischman's books, so I can't say exactly where it fits in the ranking of his books, but this was not his best. I can say that with confidence since I read ""Whirligig"" just about three weeks ago, and it was much better than this one. I was a little confused if Courtney was going crazy or what was going on in that girl's head. Did this boyfriend from Italy really exist? The book is just slow and the most character developkment would be from Courtney being tired and not willing do things to crazy and hallucinating. I would not recommend this book unless you just really love to read. If that is the case, I am sure you will get something out of it."
4,and Jesus meant it,"A truly scholarly anaylsis of the teachings of Jesus from a Catholic's point of view - but applicable to all Christendom. Certainly makes one think about the views held by the Religious Right and promugated by the evangelical churches in our country today. Since Jesus never wrote a book, or recorded a DVD, etc. we only have the words of the gospels to let us know his philosophy, doctrine, and connection to the Father. By his life, death and ressurection, we can know how to live and die."
5,Wonderful,This book is excellent for true believers and followers of Jesus. It reminds me of another excellent book about the boy Christ called The Little Boy by Rohan Hall. I recommend both books highly.
1,"More sola scriptura, if you like that","The book delivers the promise on the dust jacket, of showing the Jesus who is not political or ""religious"" in any conventional sense. It's nice to read Jesus words anyplace, in the Bible or elsewhere.But, Wills betrays his Catholic upbringing on many pages. He finds no mention of priests, bishops, or popes in the New Testament, nor does he show any respect for any other form of organized Christian religion.He doesn't give the Catholic Church the credibility to rub two nickels together, much less to canonize the works of the Bible itself. Wills shows so much contempt for organized Christianity, as being unfaithful to Jesus. He ends up sounding to me as if he's criticizing Jesus for failing to lay down a plan for spreading the gospel. If it was not via an organized church, then what does Wills think Jesus meant?"
4,Not For the Right or the Left--Well Worth Reading,"Those who would align Jesus with today's poltical right or political left (and there are both) may not like this book. They may well brand it heresy...But those of us who think Jesus was not a political figure in the sense of today's thinking will find it well worth the read. Much of modern religion tries to compartmentalize Jesus to espouse their preconceived notions. Thus the title of the book: ""What Jesus Meant"" It could be subtitled ""What Jesus REALLY Meant!"" A reader who approaches this book with an open mind and a sincere search for knowledge and truth will find this to be a valuable read. Those who come with preconceived notions of their own infalibility will be threatened by it. Read it. Think. That is part ""working out"" one's faith."
2,don't confuse a story with history,"If Wills was actually a scholar, he would know that most of the story in the New Testament was copied from a biography of Julius Caesar that was popular around 50 AD. The ""real"" - and I use the term loosely - the ""real"" Jesus never said any of the learned phrases that were attributed to him in the decades after all of the people who actually knew him passed away.So, as far as telling us ""what Jesus really meant"" goes, nothing in this book is credible. The title is just another empty sales pitch."
