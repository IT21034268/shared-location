4,"Not That Bad, Folks!","I personally don't see why so many people are down on Season 2. I came to it with very low expectations, based on all the reviews here. Surprisingly, I was very pleased with it. It certainly isn't up to the bar of Season 1, but what is? Season 1 was almost perfect.With regard to the writer's strike, I'm sure that took a toll on everything--rushed productions, rushed story-arcs, etc. I give it the benefit of the doubt on that front. That said, there are some criticisms...Could it have been done better? Probably. But I still like this season. Should they have killed of Sylar? YES. He's getting very tired/old/annoying (Time for a new villain, folks). Did they need to bring in Maya and Alejandro? NO. Dumb, dumb characters. Especially Alejandro.The main issue is this: Is this show still better than 80% of the other stuff on TV? YES!If you're not sure about it, rent it first. I lost patience and purchased a copy this weekend. I wasn't disappointed (much). I eagerly await Season 3!"
3,They got the price right. But the season was terrible.,"I loved the first season. But the second was a huge let down. However... it's still better than most other television shows (except for Lost).On the plus side, Unlike the Lost S4 DVD, they actually LOWERED the price on the Heroes S2 DVD since the Season was shortened."
1,What about my MAC?,I find it hard to believe Amazon is not making it possible for MAC users to watch these shows. I guess I will stick to iTunes!
4,Stakes are just as good as season 1,"My wife and I got sucked into season 1 after randomly renting it and we were instantly sold. As you probably know if you're reading this review, season one of heroes is five stars! season 2 doesn't disappoint but the writers strike caused it to be too short - only 13 eps. Not 24 like the first season. Regardless it was still pretty cool and entertaining. The overall stakes don't feel as dire and all the characters don't feel as connected story-wise. Still worth four stars to me though. Buy it - you'll like it. LOST is better any day though..."
1,Purchased and it doesn't work... bad service,"purchased the show, charged my accountand it won't play..... what a junk."
1,Unsatisfying in just about EVERY episode,After the end of season one.. I attempted to give Heroes a second chance. Although... Most of the characters I'd grown fond of were gone... the new plots were.. kind of odd and not well explained. Each episode was nonconclusive on all levels. I dunno... LOST pulls this off somehow by giving a little bit of info here and there... but this one managed to highly irritate me.
1,Did not get the DVD,I never got this DVD and never got any response from the seller. I also did not get a credit.I am very unhappy with this seller.
2,Even Tim Kring....,"If Season Two was allegedly so great, why did creator Tim Kring feel the need to publicly apologize for the first seven episodes? Nothing happened. No plot. Let's see....Hiro's in medieval Japan. Next week, Hiro's in medieval Japan. And still more weeks of this tedious plotline. Nothing moved the story along. It's like Lost; like they ran out of fresh ideas. It was like watching paint dry. Thank God for ""24"".It gets an extra star as a wedding present for George Takei and Brad."
1,No Mac Viewing Capability,It would seem that this can not be watched on an Apple product (ITunes/Ipod/ITouch) which is disappointing to say the least.I am a loyal Amazon user (at least two purchases a month) but this decision to provide episodes (but not for mac users) makes it easier to switch to other suppliers of product.Amazon - you are better than this. Get this resolved for Mac users.
4,Heroes volume 2,I actually have just gotten back into this series. I use to watch it when it was on t.v. I like the plot and the excitement of how the heroes go through their lives trying to figuring out how to save the world while learning how to use their powers.
5,Heroes,Excellent tail of evolutionary jumps. Love the style of the tale and the chesiveness of the the plot. The characters are believable and show reall life adversity. Looking forward to the rest.
3,its entertaining,well the show has a lot of promise and i cant wait for the 3rd season. this show seems to just linger on and it could be better if it had a story line every episode.it feels more like a soap opera or a movie that doesnt end than a show.the concept is great but the way they brought it together kind of sucks.they should have a different story line every episode instead of the same story for a whole season...very annoying.
3,Disappointing,"I'll still order this shortened box set because Amazon is putting such a good preorder price on it but I'm highly disappointed in Universal and some other studios for expecting full price for half the product. We understand the writers strike slowed down production, but the price should reflect the fewer episodes we're getting! $29.99 would have been more appropriate for this set."
3,Strike shortened season - 11 episodes,"When buying Heroes on DVD, you should know what you are getting with each season.Season 1: 23 episodes, plus the un-aired alternate version of the series pilot, 1035 minutes total. Quite a bargain at current prices.Season 2: 11 episodes, 484 minutes. Season 2 was ruined by a writer's strike.Unlike some Heroes fans, I enjoyed the time spent with Hiro in feudal Japan, but at the current best prices (about $6 used/$10 new for Season 1 and $8 used/$17 new for Season 2), I'm not eager to pay to watch Season 2 again on DVD.Season 3: 25 episodes, 1073 minutes."
3,Too short,"My biggest complaint about this season, and I know many others have the same, is that it was too short. The Hiro storyline was a bit too long, the Peter storyline was a bit unnecessary, but I did like the Nathan storyline. Mind you, I didn't hate the whole Peter storyline, just the part when he's in Ireland. Overall, the season left me wondering how good it would have been had there not been a strike and they could have done a real season two. I know a lot of people became disillusioned because of its length and the fact they couldn't tell the correct story for the length of the season. I didn't hate the season, but of the three that I've seen, this is the weakest of the bunch. However, it is definitely worth watching."
3,not as exspected,"This is a great little book and I was hoping to give it to a friend, but unfortunatly this used book has some water damage and is not in good enough condition to gift. I guess that's what i get for buying a used copy. I've had luck with used items int he past...."
3,Um....where was that?,"Maybe it's just me, but when I see a movie a couple times, my memory can usually remember where a certain track belongs in the film. When listening to the score of a film, I can almost visually put the movie right to, reciting word for word what's happening on the screen. But with this one, they all seem to blend together for me. Don't get me wrong the music is great. I really love the Armageddon Piano track, even if it is incredibly short. Still overall a good soundtrack."
3,Piece poor job pitting it together,"Rabin is a commercial musician. Commercial musician make a collection of songs and then put then into a CD. That's exactly what he did. Toto did the same in Dune soundtrack.I cannot deny Rabin has talent but he does not know how to create the feeling as Zimmer did in The Rock. Zimmer disk takes you in a tour. Rabin just showed he is a composer.Imagine a masterpiece, chop it, scramble the pieces and then put them on the CD. That's what he did.I can say that track 9 is long enough to break that chop-scramble pattern. I will have to re-sort that album and record it on cassette for personal use because I do not want to reprogram CD player every time I listen it.Of course if you listen the samples you may see he's got talent. All in all he is good but I still prefer The Rock."
4,GREAT SOUNDTRACK BUT MISSING SOME MUSIC,"I REALLY LIKED THE MUSIC, HOWEVER MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE WAS MISSING FROM THE ALBUM. 1)THE MOVIE OPENING SCENES, 2)WHEN THE SHUTTLES CIRCLE THE MOON THEN CRASHES AND LANDS ON THE ASTEROID, AND 3)WHEN HARRY STAMPER PUSHES THE BUTTON AND DIES. THE SOUNDTRACK HAS MUSIC NOT IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIE. THAT'S NICE. BUT, WHEN I HEAR MUSIC IN THE MOVIE AND IT IS MISSING IN THE SOUNDTRACK I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN CHEATED! I FEEL THAT THERE WAS ENOUGHT TAPE TO PUT ALL OF THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE ON IT. I GUESS THERE WILL BE A SOUNDTRACK SCORE II? JUST LIKE THE TITANIC SOUNDTRACKS. OTHERWISE, IT IS A GOOD SOUNDTRACK."
3,"A very good CD, but missing the best bits of the movie.","This soundtrack captures a lot of the 'feel' of the original movie but I only give it three stars because the best music from the film (astronauts preparation, burn around the moon and Harry pressing the button) are completely missing. These bits of music are fantastic and were composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. They are far superior to the tracks produced by Trevor Rabin. If you have seen the movie and want to buy the soundtrack beware - you will be disappointed!"
2,ANTHROPOLOGY STUDIES HOW MEN DEVELOP IN PRIMITIVE TRIBES,"David D. GilmoreManhood in the Making:Cultural Concepts of Masculinity(New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1990) 258 pagesConventional manhood as found in several primitive tribes:warrior, food-gatherer, big-talker, etc.Each culture has definite ideas and means for creating 'masculinity'.If you would like to know about better books on 'masculinity',search the Internet for the following bibliography:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
2,Ugh...,"This book was horrid. I was bombing the class all year with this text, until I bought REA's electromagnetics problem solver. Going into the final, I had maybe a B. By studying the REA book and working my [...] off before the final, I got that up to a final mark of A-. The physics students at my school used Griffith's electrmagnetics book, and they seemed to enjoy that book a lot more.This book was slightly better when I took a waveguides course... imagine my disgust when I found out we were using this book, again! Even the waveguides sections were still quite weak, though, but they do keep me from rating this book a 1."
5,lowest price for small trade off,the book was in a decent condition with only one problem. The picture showed hard cover and US edition but recieved a low-price edition with paper cover but the contents are the same.
1,would not play,"Tried to play it, but it read could not play in this zone, whatever that means. It was like it wasnt formatted for this region. Anyways, will not be ordering from this seller again. I think when you put in a dvd, it is supposed to play right? Not this one."
2,It's a tube of jelly.,"I did not like this product. You might as well eat regular jelly, because that's what it is, a tube of jelly. It's not very tasty and the texture is not a good texture for a snack. I love their fruit leather though."
2,Almost impossible to read,"This is one case in which the caution about an e-edition is justified. In this book the apostrophes, so important in French, are suppressed, and it becomes very hard to read. I gave up after the first page. This hasn't happened in any of the Kindle e-editions in French that I got so far. In general, they are excellent and I have enjoyed them and will continue getting them but I want to warn future readers of this book. A pity, because I had never read anything about this famous author and would have liked to."
1,Not a TRUE Artist!,"Temmora claims to have written ""There's no ME"". She is a liar! She did not write that song. An artist in Memphis wrote that song. His name is Fletcher. He is an awesome singer and Temmora and Hewitt did no justice to the song, they actually butchered it!! wanted to give 0 stars but could not."
3,The Raven,Intriguing but a bit morbid which we should have realized if we had read more of the preview or watched the trailer. We got hooked on it because we needed to find out who the culprit was.
5,Love John Cusack in this,I found the movie interesting and loved John Cusack in this role. I have recommended this to all my friends.
1,Disappointed,This movie sucked I would have rather spent my money on a dog terd or a big green slimy booger!
2,BORING,Ugh... this movie was boring. I bought it for a date night and we turned it off after 20 minutes. I watched the rest another day and was said to have wasted 2 hours to John Cusack.
3,Disappointing,"As would be expected, one has to have some basic familiarity with Poe's life and work to appreciate what this film at least tries to do. I cannot imagine anyone who's never read him having any motivation to watch ""The Raven"" all the way through. On that note, however, Poe fans may also be in for a let-down.Though one really has to strain to keep disbelief suspended in certain places, the plot is solid enough and makes good use of meaningful clues and details--good for those who like to figure out ""whodunit?"" The acting is competent, and the script avoids being too stereotypically 19th-century. The delivery, though, is flat and rehearsed, and the way EAP himself is presented as such an arrogant and histrionic twit doesn't help matters.The whole feel of ""The Raven"" is quite contrived, like watching a play that's not quite good enough to make us forget the stage and all its props."
3,I liked it more than it probably deserved.,"3.5 stars.I think it's cool that they made a movie having anything to do with Poe. Still, the plot isn't exactly original. I won't spoil the ending but it is not the cliche happy-ever-after ending, which I appreciated. I like John Cusack too, so that also contributes to my liking the movie more than it probably deserved.Recommended."
5,Watch this 3 times,I love John Cuzak and he was the perfect person for the Edgar Allan Poe Character. It was well played out and the mystery keeping you on the edge of your seat!
3,"Decent movie, just not in the elite class!","This movie is entertaining and contains some very good acting. The only problem the movie as a whole is that it does get very boring at times, and as a result, does tend to lag through out the entire movie. It just gets a little bit slow at spots, and as a result, is not the most pleasant movie to watch. It is worth watching, just not one of the best ever. Ciusack is great, so ate least the movie has that going for it."
3,It was OK,"I love John Cusack, who doesn't. With that said this was not the best movie I have seen. Not the worst either."
1,Dont watch,"Please dont rent this movie, I dont u/s why they made this it was not good, or worth your time."
1,"For your sakes, don't watch it!!!","This movie was horrible! For the potential story to have that much promise, it falls flat like a 2-dimensional brick! At the end, I didn't care about the story; I just wanted it to end."
3,It was cool,Well the film used quite a few of Edgar Allen Poe's story's avd mysteriousNovels. I would say anyone familiar with his writings would find it intriguing.
4,The Raven Review,It is difficult for me NOT to love a movie with John Cusack and The Raven is no exception. A+ casting and a fun story make for an engaging film!
3,See this movie,The Raven is a telling film about Edgar Allen Poe and all his many flaws. It's a journey through the abysmal depths of the darkest minds and how even darkness can inspire heroism in the broodiest of minds.
1,Don't watch if you are easily bored...,...this has all the momentum of a sloth climbing a slippery tree. After 30 minutes i gave up and turned it off. It is a movie that fails to capture attention and build expectations that are necessary in any decent story line.
2,so troubling,"The acting was adequate. This is not the Poe I know. The actors must work within the realms of what is written, and they perform admirably. The writer didn't quite catch poe as a character. Ladies man? Bar room brawler? They missed a chance to give life to a weird, dorky, twisted genius. Pearls befor swine."
5,Extreme,"This movie was at an extreme hieght for this actor, he has fallen to the dark side, but in a goodway. I remember him in Serendipity, but if you look close in 1804 the movie gave off a little of that character, in ""The Raven"", the character did not have enough caffine."
3,"the raven, just ok","the preview made the movie look much better than it was. i would give it 2 and a half stars out of 5. the film was just ok, neither good or bad. it tried, but didn't quite make it."
1,Never got to see it,Time ran out before I was able to watch the time frame to watch was to short but my fault not the movie I did go an rent it and was very enjoying
3,Too dark,"I expected the story to be dark (and it was), but the cinematography yielded a film that was so dark that I often couldn't see what was happening on the screen."
3,Cusack fan,"We like John Cusack's movies for the most part (major exception - 2012). He does a superb job in this movie as Poe, and the plot is engaging and complex. Well worth watching. I did not rate it higher as I did not care for the ending. Cusack is exceptional and makes the entire movie worth the viewing."
5,Superb rendition of the path,"Thanks! I suspected my copy entitled ""The Journey to Enlightenment"" and this book ""The Spirit of Tibet"" were the same book. Your post verified that. This is one of my favorite books. I have read and re-read the poetry many times--especially when I need encouragement on the path. The author has a cryptic manner of pinpointing the path for the first seeker to the guru. Khyentse Rinpoche was an extraordinary teacher and this telling of his story is absolutely breathtaking--in the pictures as well as the poetry."
1,Waste of time.,Didn't fit. Waste of time. It bent inside the arbor and after an hour of messing with it it bent and broke. Thanks for charging me $6 to mail me one washer.
5,This band gets around!,"I was amazed to read another review on this album, saying these guys were spotted in Alaska! I live in SoCal and have seen them everywhere. I first saw them play at the 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. I was absolutely enchanted. I bought Reflections there. It was wonderful to see people in the streets dancing to this inspiring music. You can't resist moving your feet and clapping your hands when you hear them play. I saw them again at a the Fairplex in Pamona. I also randomly spotted them in San Diego on a day trip. They really get around!It's hard for me to put my finger on why this music is so infectious. There is something about Andean instruments -- they have such an emotional voice. I listen to this music when I'm writing, when I need relaxation, when I am tired of the world and need to hear a joyful harmony... it enlivens me, and just about everyone who hears it.This is the purest form of musical beauty."
2,Poor Quality,"This paper was advertised as being a ""Bond"" paper - However, it is thin and flimsy, not what I would consider bond. It can be printed on one side only, as it is so thin that the ink bleeds through the paper -- If you are looking for a quality paper, ""DON'T BUY THIS""..........."
3,Sorkin lite,"Remember West Wing? The dazzling dialogue. The complex, interweaving storylines. The intensity of the moral dilemmas. The great height of the stakes.Well, Sorkin brings many of those elements to this show, except for the stakes. They are quite low, and all the reflex Sorkin intensity is borderline laughable. It doesn't work but, because the Sorkin way is unusually entertaining and allows for some interesting character development, it is quite fun to watch. Also, there are some great female characters."
5,Great Show,"Some of my friend loved immediately, others need a couple of episodes, but all of them ended up completely hooked by studio 60. The show is great. I hope it continues some day."
2,Chauvinism run amok,"On the job, when a man asks a woman out repeatedly, and she repeatedly says no, and she then asks him point-blank to stop and he says, ""No."", that is, by definition sexual harassment. Not only does the show seem to think this creepy behavior is romantic, he actually gets the girl. There were parts of West Wing that were sexist and condescending to women, but this show is far, far worse. I am so glad that it went off the air after only one season. It deserves it."
4,"Great Series, fairly good Dvd","I've enjoyed so much this series. It's a shame it got cancelled. They always cancel the best shows..The dvd is fine, you get to see some extras but not as many as I would want. Anyway, it's worth it, don't lose the chance to watch this magnific show."
5,Tied for best of the season.,"There are several excellent episodes but I have two distinct favorites:1) Christmas Show. FCC fines, christmas tree covered in socks, burnt coconut for snow, Danny Trip falling in love, forceful Ed Asner all make this a good show to watch. But it becomes outstanding with the treatment of the New Orleans musicians. So moving and beautiful. If you like horn music, this is a must. Seen it several times and the music still gives me goosebumps.2) The Harriet Dinner Pt 1. Comedy. Farse. The ferret. Just gotta laugh."
3,Great Writing; Predictable Politics,"Aaron Sorkin remains the best television writer in Hollywood. If he would only get out a little more from the echo chamber of left wing politics he might be able to keep a show on the air for longer than one (Studio 60) or two (Sports Night) seasons. A little sublety would be a nice touch. Instead he pounds the viewer with a storyline that revolves around the ""courage"" of attacking the Christian Right and the cast's lone and apparently misguided Christian character. Someone needs to tell him that courage should be made of sterner stuff. Attack Muslim extremists with the same gusto and I'll be impressed. The cast is high quality and well suited to the task. They do a good job of delivering the always sharp Sorkin scripts in spite of the heavy handed self-righteousness."
5,Sorkin Fan,"A very good show, it was getting better towards the end, and I can understand why it didn't have the appeal of The West Wing, who cares about rich young wise guys? Anyway, I missed it mostly when it was on the air, but did enjoy the complete series... Sorkin's style of writing is my favorite. If you want something lighter try Sports Night, also written by Aaron Sorkin."
5,studio 60 - a show worth watching,"Studio 60 , even in New Zealand was given a horrendous time slot. That said i made every effort to watch it.Studio 60 provided something different to all the hospital/CSI/Police type shows on television , and with a lot more class. Honestly the show has been the most intelligent and interesting show that i have seen in a while.the characters were likeable and one could relate to the characters in all their failings and successes.i really am looking forward to getting hold of this series and watching over the entire lot again"
3,We Get It....,"Having a Christian in Hollywood is CRAAAAAAAAAAAZY. I mean, nothing has ever so wild and unbelievable as having someone of faith be an actress. This horse is dead by the first episode and beaten over and over for the rest of the series. The best part of the series comes when John Goodman shows up as a back country judge and spends the majority of the show shutting everyone up and telling them how unfunny they really are, which is a sad thing for a show supposed,y about a variety show and comedy writers and comedians.Imagine 30 Rock that isn't funny. That's this show. It's an intense drama about comedians which makes the tone and pace way off. I went from watching The West Wing to this, hoping it would follow suit. Not so much. Interesting, but not good."
5,fabbo tv,hey folks...Ive only seen two epoisodes of this show on sat tv.... and im so buying this box!!! what Im wondering tough is.... how can such a fab tv show fail to find an audiance.... kinda makes you wonder... if you like quality tv.. this is a must
3,Only mediocre...,"This movie is good.. but not as good as i've seen. It shows you more of the Dragon Ball Z universe, but it still only shows the kaios (God of galaxies) hierarchy, and none of the Kaio-shin (God of galaxy clusters). Not much action, and Goku doesn't even go SSJ. However, this video has it's moments; the action scenes with Pikehan are extremely cool! And as stated before, this is much more of a filler to the DBZ plot, just like all of the DBZ movies.Verdict: Rent it, borrow it, or get it from the library. Buying it is not a good way to spend your money."
5,2003's Most Beautiful Home Living Book,"The cozy timberframe home - also known as post-and-beam - is the one home design style that probably elicits more `longing for' than any other. Unfortunately, with cookie-cutter suburban developments plopping `bloated toad' houses on barren lots, not too many of us can escape to our lodge-like home. But we can sure lose ourselves in the dreams of owning one - or designing and building one. Now, good friend of our LivingHome.com site, Michael Morris, and Dick Pirozzolo, have produced with The Lyons Press 2003's most beautiful home living book, The Timberframe Way. This holiday we can't wait to sit around the fireplace in our way-more-ugly home than those pictured in the book and drool over every picture."
4,Good adaption,"This movie was a decent adaption of the book. Written by the same author, many of te small details and personalities of the team members have been put in the movie. Naturally, the movie is at best, a synopsis of the book due to budget and time restraints, which is why I recommend reading it first, then watching the movie. As a stand alone movie, it has decent action and a pretty good plot (the novel fleshes everything out alot better) and Sean Bean as always, delivers lines and action the way he always does. Not a bad purchase."
5,Ultimate Resource for Golden Age WONDER WOMAN fans!,"Written with obvious love and admiration, this is the definitive history of the Golden Age Amazon Princess and the effusive character who created her, William Moulton Marston. Filled with wonderful art work, rare photographs and fun facts...this a collectible no Wonder Woman fan should be without. Well done!"
3,different,"Declaration is comical, its probably more entertaining for children then the older dragon ball z fans .But for anyone who wants to collect every episode of dbz it will be good ."
2,For the intermediate or advanced folder,"This book has some negatives but also some pros. First the pros: the color photos of the finished projects are quite lovely and there seems to be lots of information. Now the negatives: there are too many dissimilar projects included, no suggestions on making the project your own, projects organized in a stiff and formal manor, instructions feel as if you have to dive right in rather than testing the waters to see if you enjoy the process, no rating system (i.e. beginner, intermediate, challenging) to gage how difficult the project is, and it seems to assume you already are familiar with the technique already. I wanted to like the book and the technique, but it felt like an intermediate or advanced text rather than for a beginner. You might have better luck if you already know the technique."
2,certainly not automated,This book is basically about using moving averages. The author at times does not recommend using stop loss. Books by Elder + study guide I found to be more useful in money management area. The method is discretionary and is difficult to program into any computer for backtesting to see performance statistics.
4,"Wow, that was difference!!","Just been given this cd as a birthday gift. Didn't listen to for a while , then one night i put it on and found myself falling in love with it within minutes, so laid back but not. Very mellow and yet at the same time has so much energy in each track, the guys that did this sure know how to make someone relax....""storm"" being the one for me"
1,Fundamentally Flawed,"Mr. Harvey has done a commendable job of listing important events and some of the principal figures that participated in the great wave of revolution that freed South America from her colonial masters. However, in tackling so vast a panorama, the author fatally damages his own efforts. Harvey ignores critical leaders, their underlying motivations and critical social and economic undercurrents in an effort to preserve his focus on the more ""heroic"" liberators. He would have been better served dividing his work between the principal regions: the Viceroyalty of the River Plate, Portuguese Brasil, and New Granada; they are sufficiently different that they should not be treated in the same work, anymore than a history of the United States need necessarily be joined to one of Canada or Mexico. I would not recommend this book given that there are far better and more accurate websites for interested investigators (though most require a knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese)."
2,Book was damaged in shipping.,"Book was damaged in shipping I presume, and I cannot reach A1Books by phone to speak with them.I would be happy to change this unfavorable rating, but I would need another copy of the book"
4,Amazing Film,"Wow,,, after watching this movie I was really impressed. The filming is great and the story line is fantastic. The plot isn't all that realistic but the setting is. The soundtrack is a good fit for the film and the artwork is good. People interested in the underground artwork community will love this as well as serious writers.Overall I was extremely satisfied with this film and would recommend it too most."
1,This movie is a Bomb,"Graffiti is fascinating stuff. The people who do it are artists. This movie, however, is garbage. Over-acted and force-fed with idiotic slang that is already dated, ""Bomb the System"" takes a fascinating subject and portrays it in a way that trivializes all the motivations and purpose behind graffiti. I can only assume that the stellar reviews this movie has gotten so far are from people with no first hand experience of the subject, the same way that ""You Got Served"" was praised for its accurate portrayal of the breakdancing subculture by an overweight housewife in Muncie, Indiana.Avoid this steaming pile at all costs."
4,audio technica,"great turntable, the only problem was a few scratches on the dust cover. The sound is great, if you can find for under 200 you should definitely buy it. It is professional quality that anyone can use."
3,NICE LOOKING PIECE,"I like this turntable for an entry level price.Sound quality is great although upgradable,but I can't justify any need to spend anymore on something that is fine as is.I guess this is in the DJ catagory,so with that my only gripes are:1.Why do you need a reverse.Yes,you can play stuff in reverse.2.No auto start,must be done manually.3.No auto off,when a side ends you have to manually lift the arm off and set it back in it's holder.It has a lever to do all this smoothly though without actually touching the arm itself."
3,Sounds great. Missing a few features though.,Maybe it's just me. My record players in the past has automatic features like arm returns to it's home when album is finished. Push one button and arm starts on song 1. I guess I didn't think about these issues beforehand since I figured this was a givin'.Other than that major issue for me the player is wonderful. You can do just about everything with it. It also allow you to play those old 78 records from the old days which was I was really concerned about. It's really sweet looking compared to those $99.00 ones.I'd suggest it if the auto features are not an issue with you. It should at least be an option.
2,Good looks--Poor performance,"Sorry to report this, I really wanted it to work for me and I love the features...but...What it all boils down to is quiet, and it's not. There is no ground strap which once was part of any turntable equipment. I can not rid this turntable of motor hum when it's turned on in either a direct to phono connection or using their built in phono pre-amp. There is always a slight hum each time it's turned on--no way around it. I am thinking of returning it, which is discouraging because I like it in every other way. Grrrr!"
5,A Great Buy,I bought this record player for my boyfriend and it has turned out to be a great investment. I didn't know the first thing about record players but a friend recommended I buy this one. I did a lot of research and decided to go with the audiotechnica. The quality and the sound it puts out is really worth the purchase. My boyfriend loves it! And not to mention it looks awesome and is really well made. For $200 you can't find a better buy!!
4,From B.O.N.E enterpri$e to Bone Thugs this album is tight,"Creepin on ah come up had only 8 songs and the last 1 moe cheddar is instrumental. That is probably the only reason why is not a classic or as good as East 1999 Eternal. Bone Thug's second album (due to faces of death release under B.O.N.E Enterpi$e name) brings it the quija and murder style that later on characterizes Bone Thugs throught the country. The young thugs rip up the mic in classic singles like thuggish ruggish bone and foe tha love of $ wit Eazy-E. But if you hear those two songs on the radio and think their good. Creepin on ah come up's production has songs like no surrender with a fast tight beat that blows up lyrics. A defenite satisfaction, but due to the lack of number of songs it only gets 4 stars"

4,True to its title,"This collection of short fiction is bound to have something to interest any reader of Fantasy. If you're new to Fantasy or Tanith Lee, this collection will definately give you insight into the spectrum of the genre and Lee's talent. Since some of the stories come from other collections that share a common theme or concept, they can be confusing standing alone, but are still likely to entertain any reader. The best quality is that the stories can be read and re-read, and still maintain their intrigue."
2,Nearly 3 hours of alexander? no thanks,"Look, three hours is too long.THis movie is not a good movie but I don't want to be so mean.The cast is very poor. Colin farrel playing a hero and a bold and loyal conqueror? sorry, he doesn't fit it. I always see him playing a druggie or a bad person, he's better at that as it suits his raunchy personality.Colin and angelina Jolie do not fit. The battles look boring and hopeless. talking... blah... and things like that.the story line is not good. Please view a documentary. its more informative. There are some good parts but are over shadowed by the faults in this movie.I wish there were 2 Alexander films, then there woulod be more competitiona dn you can choose to see which one is better.avoid..!"
1,Curious motivations.,"What this movie boils down to is one great battle scene surrounded by incessant character assassination. Why, more than two thousand years later, a popular director should be so offended by a historical figure as to create work of such intense defamation has to be wondered about.The film segments which show any of the major characters in anything resembling a positive nature could be edited down to several minutes in total. The remainder is dedicated to proving that Macedonians were foul people, their leaders even more foul, and the world around them only a debauched cesspool.Three versions now of this pejorative portrayal. How could one director be so obsessed with such perverseness?"
1,What a waste!!,"What a waste of time! After viewing the original I had higher expectations for the new director's cut. With all the flashbacks it was difficult to follow what was going on at certain times. Keep your finger on the fast forward button, this is the only way to watch this film."
4,Not as bad as the critics would have you believe,"I have to admit Colin Farrell is not the sort of actor I would ever envisage as Alexander the Great, despite this he does do the role credit despite what many people have said.Angelina Jolie howver is brilliant as his witch Queen mother, beauiful, seductive and full of feminine wiles whilst Val Kilmer gives a great performance as the doomed father of Alexander who does not see his son's worth.There are some great battle scenes, fabulous scenary, stunning costumes, and all in all the cast gel together to make it a watchable movie for the older members in your family.My only complaint is that it is rather long winded in parts but other than that it is a pretty good movie."
2,Mediocre,"Hopkins is still the best, but himself alone cannot save the movie.Too bad. Fight scenes? I guess Gladiator set a standardand nobody can reach it yet.More to say, but ...I'll save it.Wasted my money."
1,The worst movie of all time.,"This is truly the worst movie of all time. This is what I have been saying for the last year. I was one of the fools who paid to see this at the movies. And somehow managed to stay until the end. The only enjoyment that came from this film was hearing the other theatergoers laughing at this sad, sad film. If you love motivational speeches there are about ten in this film. If you love pointless attempts at being contraversial. Then this may be the movie for you. But probably not. Please dont fall for the 'Directors Cut' ploy by the studio. A director who has fallen as far as Oliver Stone cant be trusted. And I doubt Spielberg could help this one. Maybe someday we can get a laugh track version of this film. That may get a little action from the discount isle. But again I have to say probably not."
1,Terrible,I saw this with a friend in theatres and was so disappointed. He should have died many times making impossible escapes.
2,Crushed,"When I heard the bad reveiws for this movie I couldnt belieive my ears. I mean with a cast the likes of Angelina Jolie, Collin Farel and Val KIlmer how could this movie be bad!!! So I bought this movie hoping to see another classic done with a new twist. I didnt beleive the bad reveiws on Troy and I was extremly happy when I saw it a classic reborn with a new twist and a new generation of actors that climb to rival the old generation of stars from the 50s and 60s. When I watched Alerxander my hopes were crushed. The actors did their best with the material they had but I beleive the story was too convoluted and kept jumping from future to past and present too much. The story line was hard to follow and instead of keeping the story linear it was just too confusing. The battle scenes while acted and performed well were just as hard to follow. In my humble opinion I would pass on this movie. If you like period peices from mytho9logy I would suggest Gladiator or Troy."
1,Not for straight guys,"After hearing Collin Farrel and Val Kilmor with Celtic accents..It was like watching Brave(Gay)Heart part two, I thought Slavic was the dominant language in Macedonia??? Too many homo scenes. For those rating this movie with Five Stars...How much were you paid??? The CD case should have a self distruct mechanism in it. Collin Farrel looked like a fag in this movie, not that he's already one to begin with."
1,Why I buy used ...,"I lived in rural Alaska for some years and missed being able to browse through my favorite new and used CD/DVD stores in the Bay Area ... Rasputin's and Amoeba. Happily, I live near them again. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This movie is the near perfect reason why you should buy used. This movie does what only a handful of movies have done before ... it both blows and sucks! I haven't witnessed any comparable level of bad acting in recent memory. I won't address issues regarding historical context here ... it's a movie people, Hollywood is Hollywood and they don't care about history ... they care about entertainment, or they care about the lowest common denominator, or they care about both ... whichever choice will make the most cash. As for Oliver Stone, he can be entertaining, but here he is just inept. I lay the fault for this crap squarely on his head. One question, though: Colin, dude, what were you thinking?"
1,There's nothing like a great epic,"And this is exactly what we have here. Yes, Oliver Stone's Alexander is nothing at all like a great epic. I can't believe anybody here actually rates this dross.Oliver a word of advice, go and study Kurasawa's Ran before you make another battle scene."
3,Bad acting gets in way of a nice production.,"I had high expectations for this movie, but was very much disappointed with the acting. Perhaps there was too much focus on the homosexuality and Oedipal issues. In my mind this is because these were different issues back in ancient Greece when, apparently, homosexuality among soldiers was encouraged to develop esprit de corps. I wish a better historical backdrop could also have been provided, as this alone is fascinating."
2,flat,"I just couldn't see Colin Farrel as Alexander. Instead of ancient Greek/Macedonian, Colin managed to look modern Irish with a blond wig for the entire movie. With the exception of Anthony Hopkins in the role of the aging Ptolemy, nothing in particular about this movie stood out."
2,Alexander the Numbskull,"I'm not attacking Oliver Stone's effort or anything. I'm just saying, strictly as a member of the audience who's shelled out money with the hope of being entertained, that it's hard to enjoy a movie when you can't wait for the main character to die. Alexander leads a huge uninspired army that wants to go home. And all he does for much of the movie is force them to keep going. At some point, I could no longer sympathize with him. It would be different if his followers WANTED to conquer the world, but they didn't."
2,Homsexual to the max,"This movie started out perfect. Alexander the Great is well known and should have been a perfect movie to depict the life and times of one so popular in his realm, but the amount of homosexual innuendos suggested in this movie made me sick. It ruined the entire movie for me and my family. YUCK YUCK YUCKIf you are sickened by extreme presentation of homosexuality, disregard this movie."
2,Miscasting at its worst!,"Colin Farrell was absolutely the worst choice for Alexander. He was never believable. It was the most cardboardish characterization in movies I have ever seen. Colin Farrell looked like a bleached blond porn star. Yikes! What was Oliver Stone thinking!?? Horrendous. The fact that Anthony Hopkins spends a sizable chunk of the movie narrating the movie to a scribe does not help either. Rent, don't buy if you must check out the train wreck for yourself. Try Troy if you're looking for a nice epic."
2,Alexander,"After seeing all three versions, in three one gets a better perspective asto the nature of Alexander. Reading other reviews I have come to the conclusion that most individuals have read little or nothing about Alexander the Great. Oliver Stone has taken some poetic license in his movie as is to be expected. It is still entertaining even for someone who has read quite a bit about Alexander."
1,Broing and confusing,"Alexander the Great is an amazing story, yet Stone failed to doanything with it, instead delivering a confusing and boring film.Some of the key elemnets from the Alexander story are left out, like the conquest of Egypt, and Darius betrayal by his own generals.The Richard Burton film form the 60s is much better."
2,Director's Cut edition...worse than the theatrical version,"I bought both edition of the DVD because I was attractive at first as the movie broadcast on TV station. However...after I saw the Director's Cut edition. I was disappointed. All the structure of the movie became worse in this edition. The connection became strange, too. Director cutted the parts that were good in the original theatrical edition. However, some terrible / strange parts ( especially some inflate acting...etc...) were kept. Besides, the movie loss its focus. I can't feel the great of Alexander. I can't feel his emotion and personality. I can't feel more about his friendship and relationship to his collague......etc......I saw the movie became fragile and inconherent......The director may try to express something but become %#$@#$......."
3,Bad but worth it!,"After I saw this movie I started to reflect on how historic characters are perceived nowadays. Alexander did not write his biography. So whoever is going to write about him, would have to use some imagination to fill the pages of the story. Throughout history people drew many faces of Alexander's personality, and each personality is definitely influenced by the human thought of its period. To me, this movie is not about Alexander, it's rather about us. Alexander the person for sure has much more complex and rich character than the one portrayed in the movie. Oliver stone used modern ""Pop culture"" pigments to paint Alexander. The hero of the movie is no different from the hero/winner of ""survivor""!I have to admit somehow I enjoyed the movie!"
2,"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Movie","I apologize the the children's author for mis-using the title of a very good book, but it seemed so right! Assuming that the Greeks lived much like the Oliver Stone asserts, and why not, then it was hard to be Macedonian, Greek, and royal. There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life. Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much. I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie. They are the redeeming features of the whole thing. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue. Read a good book about it!! Sorry, Oliver, but it's JFK all over again. Plausible, but just not the case."
2,A waste of money,"I cannot imagine, that anybody was thinking: this is the movie we have been waiting for. Who is still interested in the longforgotten battles of an ancient Macedonian army nowadays?Colin Farell is horrible in this movie, but I didn't have a clue what Angelina Jolie was doing. Although everybody speaks English in a normal way, she is using a strange kind ofaccent. Only the fighting scenes do pass the test, but that is the only aspect of the movie that does. Do not go and see this one if you like this genre. You are still better off watching Troy.That one wasn't all that either, but at least that movie's cast isn't so bloody annoying. (SARR)"
2,This movie was trash! ! !,"This movie was garbage. I fell asleep, then the DVD started skipping, but we didnt even care because it put us out of our misery. It was worse than reading about him in Social Studies class. And I'm a history major. All it was was going from one place to the next conquering the area. Uhh.... Duhh we already knew that!!!! It only got two stars because Rosario Dawson got naked, and Angelina Jolie was in it . But the move was wiggidy wiggidy whack!!!"
3,"Some Awesome scenes, but still has inaccuracies","The battle of Guagamela was hard to see because of all the dust in the air, but the battle in the Punjab of India was nice-I've never seen a battle scene like it. Stone did a good job on the scenes with Alexander and his mother at the end, and when Alexander brings his troops home from India.innaccuracies: -The Persian troops at Guagamela were speaking Arabic-Rosario Dawson does NOT fit the description of the Bactrian (modern day Afghan) Princess Roxanne (look at the girls in Darius' Palace when Alexander enters Babylon)- Roxanne wore a burqa on her wedding day, with her face completely covered-this did not even exist nor was common in Bactria in the times of Alexander-The burning of Persepolis and the insult to Zorostrianism after Alexander's drunken fit was completely left out of the movie-Alexander didn't have blonde hair, why the whig?Despite the innaccurracies, its still a good movie about one of the best conquerors that ever lived."
1,Worthless tripe,"Except for the scenic counryside there is nothing of value in this film.Jolie is humorous as she goes to and fro with her ""accent"". Sometimes its on; sometimes not. Farrell has three things to do and he must do them many times in this movie. Get angry. Look sad. Bellow and cry. He does this over and over and over. And thats the foundation of the story."
4,I like it!,"This did prove reasonably helpful. It introduced him to the concept and help him see what he needed to do. He pretended that Henry would go the bathroom and sing the songs. I was surprised, but appreciated that the doll is anatomically correct. In the end though, I've resorted to books and bribes and that has really done the trick. I'm still glad I got the set though."
5,"Good analog tester, multi-tone options on the tone generator invaluable","On some other toners I've owned and used it is very difficult to be sure you've identified the exact pair you want. With this tone generator you simply short the pair by touching the wires together or using a screwdriver (or the tone probe tip) to short the 66 block and it changes the tone to a different pattern which is pretty easy to notice. This feature along with the really good battery life has left me impressed. The bed of nails on the tone generator leads is handy as well for identifying unterminated pairs, and the RJ11 plug works well in both RJ11 and RJ45 jacks, and it has enough power to identify even through twisted pair cable without having to use alternating pairs."
5,flukePRO3000 Franco's review,"Recien recibi el equipo, aun no lo hemos usado. Sin embargo, se recibio lo que se esperaba y luce robusto. Actualizacion se hara tan pronto tengamos informacion adicional."
2,Fell Asleep during Evening News,"I give two stars for the spelling and the use of the word 'jounced'. Yes, it is a tragic opening. Following that, completely unlikable self righteous Mom and Dan who are completely wrapped up in their intellectualized pain. So Mom takes to drinking and Dan takes off. Poor Teddy (the shooter) lives a frustrating and aimless life until his birth father wisks him away to Nebraska where he is building a dog/cat motel. 300 plus pages of selfish introspection tied up with a nice tight bow."
1,tedious,"The subject matter was of special interest to me as my extended family recently experienced a similar tragedy. But, I was turned off and totally annoyed by what I perceive to be the author's prejudice towards fat people which was blatantly portrayed in the book. Maybe the author is unaware (ha!), but when Giselle was unfairly or cruelly treated by strangers, they were always described as fat (one was ""grossly overweight."") Maybe I am particularly sensitive the negative portrayal of fat people in all of our media, but I also can no longer stand by silently and allow it to go unnoticed. Author, find another forum for your prejudice. Or better yet, find some therapy."
1,caveat emptor - you've been warned,"this product consists of 2 fans each of which has 12 blades. within the first week, 2 of the blades broken off, on their own. at this writing, the number of blades that have broken off is equal to the number that are still attached. this product is 2 months old. i'm disappointed in this product. it is a piece of crap. buyer beware."
3,Targus Chill Hub,"Targus ChillHub works great; I've had my first one over 15 months. However, one model comes with a built-in USB Port, and another does not. I prefer the one with the USB Port as it help keep desk tidy"
1,not real product,hey the product is not the one publicized. The pad you will receive do not have usb ports. As you can see the ones in the pictures show some additional USB ports (the reason I got this one) dont buy... you will pay more for shipping than for the actual product.
5,A Must Have For Any Madonna Fan.,"This is Madonna's second album.This album takes me back to goomey bracelets, net shirts, big hair bows and lace gloves.Madonna is truly the greatest female singer of all time!!!Madonna Rules!!!!"
1,MAKE HER AN ICON BUT IS THIS ALBUM REALLY GOOD,"The songs of Like A Virgin and Material Girl are the only worth listening songs here, the rest of the album is pure filler. No wonder she promoted by the VIRGIN years two tracks that were not on the album, such as the superior dance song INTO THE GROOVE and the melting sweet ballad CRAZY FOR YOU, LIKE A VIRGIN produced by CHIC crooner Nile Rodgers falls so far behind from his clever years with the DISCO act...fact is that Madonna dislikes MATERIAL GIRL, and LIKE A VIRGIN sounds classic but extremely overplayed. So IF you're plannning to start your Madonna collection with this(Cos it sold more than 10 million records in the US alone), you are truly misinformed and will end up not listening to this, buy the DEBUT stand out album, is more street more real."
5,"Madonna's ""thriller album""","this is the album that put madonna on top of the charts and made her the biggest female star on the planet. She had the pop-rock material girl, the sweet song angel, the sexy like a virgin, the cute poppy over and over, the hot ballad love don't live here anymore, the rocky dress you up, the ballad shoo be doo, and the songs pretender and stay which has the 80's sound written all over them with the synthesizers. This album is more edgy than the first one and madonna gives the dance music a pop-rock combination and goes all out in fashion and music videos."
4,Good enough to sell,"This album made of Madonna the big star she is now, but it's far from being her best. Despite of that, this album does contains two of her best tracks, the catchy and groovy ""Like a Virgin"" and the awesome ""Material Girl"". Other good songs here are ""Angel"", ""Dress You Up"" and ""Shoo Be Doo"". The rest are just fillers, like the stupids ""Pretender"" and ""Stay"", and of course the awful torchy ballad ""Love don't live here anymore"" (give me a break)"
4,Like a GOLDMINE !,"This is a classic example of 80s Pop perfection. Madonna became a massive global star due to the strenght and quality of the production on this release. On this project, Madonna (aka: MADGE to her U.K. fans) continues to vocally sing in her higher register. Some may find her vocal performance to ressemble MINIE MOUSE trapped inside a danceclub. However, her vocals add more flavor to the 80s kitch factor. Having a massive hit with ""LIKE A VIRGIN"", considered as a controversial single for radio in the mid 80s and peaking at the #1 position on the BILLBOARD charts greatly assisted to turn little MADGE into ""THE MTV DIVA of the 80s"". Other radio hits on this album are ""ANGEL"", ""DRESS YOU UP"" and ""LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE"" while ""OVER AND OVER"" became a huge... danceclub hit in late 1984. (1984)"
4,The Material Girl Does It Again,"""Like a Virgin"" spawned two of Madonna's best and most famous songs, ""Material Girl"" and the title track. (Also included on the album is the ""Dress You Up"" song that has resurfaced in the recent GAP ads.) Most of the other songs are also good, from the fast beats of ""Angel"" and ""Over and Over"" to the slightly slower (and one of my favorite tracks) ""Pretender."" But I don't particularly like either of the slower songs, ""Shoo-Bee-Do"" or ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore."" And the album's short length (only 9 songs) also detracts. But otherwise, it's a commendable and catchy sophomore effort from the Material Girl -- and if it happens once, you know it happens twice."
5,the best hands down,"the best work boots hands down, dont waste your time looking any further, I've tried them all. Wolverine (decent) Redwings (good but very heavy) Timberland (gave me blisters) DieHard (cheaply made) DrMartins (good but heavy and not really ideal for work) I do Market refrigeration and A/C & dont really need steel toes, I will tell you that from the moment you put on these boots you will know what I mean by comfortable...ohhhyaaa no break in time. These are more comfortable than my Nike BBall shoes! Trust me get these, you wont be sorry."
4,"Anatomy of Love: A Natural History of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray","Very infomative work about the cultural, biological, social, emotional and societal influences on why we stray. This book helped me understand the impact on our sexual behaviour from these things and allowed me to also understand that infidelity is not personal. When one's mate strays, it doesn't mean what most of us think it means about us. It can be a very healing experience to have this information."
4,Catchy pop-funk by ground-breaking British group,"Hot Chocolate, remarkable for being the first black British group to have continued success, made a carefully costructed, catchy brand of funk and soul music. Everyone knows You Sexy Thing because of its inclusion in The Full Monty, but most of the other 18 songs are well worth hearing too.Hot Chocolate, fronted by the songwriter Errol Brown, didn't have a lot to say musically, but were at their best when their songs were emotional pop narratives, like Emma, It Started with a Kiss, and the anti-racist polemic Brother Louie. The major hits So You Win Again and the eponymous song are just pleasant light funk.It's worth buying if you enjoy their biggest hits (and they stacked up an impressive number of them), but it's hardly an essential addition to one's collection."
1,"Amateurish, Child-like plotting and dialogue","A friend said it best - who said Nancy Drew books were dead? Pity it's published by a reputable house and in the adult mystery section - and that its actually from a series. Definitely pass on this one, even if you are just checking it out of the library."
1,corny,"Some of the lines are hard to watch because they are so corny.Some times one would think a child directed it.I even like Jim Davis,But it was hard to watch at times"
4,A veggie cooks dream come true.,"This book was amazing, and had some of the most delicous recipes in it. I held a dinner party and made a variety of things from it, and even the most hard core meat eater was impressed that there wasn't any meat in it.I highly recommend it!"
5,Rambo is still very powerful!,"After all these years, Rambo is still very powerful. The movie is very brutal, but it is true in some undeveloped countries.I love Rambo!!"
5,awesome,"I love the action that come with this DVD, by far Sylvester Stallon is one of my favorite action heros"
3,Brutal.,This movie made Saving Private Ryan look like Dora the Explorer. Need anything more be said?
4,Stallone Outdid Himself,"Stallone was in rare form in Rambo IV.The action was excellent. Rambo was a stud.Listen to the hype on this one, Rambo IV is for real.The end of the movie was perfect and I am glad the movie ended the way it did."
2,Not The First Three...,"Although the effects were great and the base story was decent, this really wasn't that good... I'm a big fan of the first three movies and this was just not like them..."
4,Surprisingly GOOD!!!!!,"I was expecting a joke of a movie, instead I really got riveted by the seemingly realistic and overall message of this picture film. Rambo is back!!!!!!"
5,great movie!!!,"i saw this movie while it was still in theatres. i loved it and couldn't wait until it was released on blu-ray. it looks incredible. this is a ""must have"" for those starting a blu-ray collection."
1,"Profanity unleashed, Christian or family viewers beware",We are always looking for Christian movies in my family and this one in the synopsis says a new Christian delivers a pizza to a dead body... There is no rating so I took a chance. The F word (and others) is used about 3 times per sentence in the first minute of the movie which is all we watched. My 2 year old heard more profanity in the few seconds it took me to reach my laptop than she has heard in her life. I am incensed to have paid for this; it is pure vileness.
5,Do promoters read these things?,"First of all, this book is not in a romance genre. It is erotic horror thriller and people who have mislabeled it should be hurt because it will cause a lot of unhappy reviews. But on to the story. If you have read ""The Lady's Tutor"", you will find that this book is sexier, darker and much more explicit. The characters are strange (and Ms. Schones' writing style contributes to the impression). I delighted in both Michael and Gabriel and I believe that this book is begging for a sequel... But I am not going to tell you why because it will spoil some serious plot twists. :) Ms. Schone, please, oh please, tell me you are going to write a sequel!"
3,A walk on the dark side,This book was nothing like the others I have read by this author. The story was difficult to follow and some of it very cryptic with no explainations. I will continue to read her but with some caution.
4,Passion and evil abound,"Robin Schone's THE LOVER is proof that erotic romance can be about more than just sex. Ms. Schone's ability to combine explicit sex with heartbreaking emotion is astounding. I'm not a fan of erotic writing in general, however, Ms. Schone caught my attention with THE LADY'S TUTOR and did not disappoint with THE LOVER. Along with the erotic, the author doesn't skimp on emotion, characterization or plot. The underlying message in both novels is the empowerment of women in a time when women had little or no control over their own fate. It's a stunning read, although some people probably won't be able to appreciate the richness of the story because of their inability to get beyond titilation."
1,Flat - this book even makes sex boring,Unbelievably flat characters and dialogue - I kept reading hoping it would get better - but the contrived situations and stilted prose never ended. Wow - a waste of time!
2,Not for the romantic at heart,"I was first introduce to Ms Schone by her short story in Captivated and was interested in her work. This is my second foray into her style of writing and while it was interesting, I would not call it romantic. Erotic horror (or mild porn) is more like it.I found the storyline was extremely confusing at times with all the dark undertones. As well, trying to figure out who the Man was gave me a headache.I am not sure if I will read anymore of her work."
2,An (unwelcome) Change Came,"Beware; this compilation has the watered down version of ""A Change Gonna Come."" The version to seek out has Cooke singing about being discriminated against on the basis of his race. Three stars deducted for dishonesty. The rest of the songs are, of course, great."
5,Sam Cooke,This CD is well worth the money. All of Cooke's big hits...plus some of his very early songs.
2,Don't waste your money!!!,"The book is completely padded with been-there-heard-that crap. Worse still is the reveal: The whole point is to peddle yet another enzyme-rich protein powder. I don't know if I was angrier at myself for not seeing this coming, or more amused by the baseness of the author's pitch.In any case, you're much better off reading Humbart Santillo's book called Food Enzymes: Missing Link to Radiant Health. Santillo has no hidden agenda and packs a ton of well-written and reader-friendly introductory material into this smallish book. (That's quite a compliment considering how overwhelmingly complex this subject is.)The Enzyme Diet Solution is my 3rd foray into the world of enzymes. Though the enzyme section is OK, the other two books were much better. (The 2nd one is Enzymes: The Fountain of Life by K. Miehlke et al.)With a paltry 44 pages devoted to enzymes in The Enzyme Diet Solution, I don't really believe this was worth the $$$ and do not recommend it at all."
5,Darkness is great,"The darkest, dirtiest, grittiest, most disgusting, disturbing,baby eating, fire breathing jungle/drum and bass ever conceived.I for one endorse this album wholly, and enthusiastically.Get it, nuff said."
4,Scooby Doo Comes Through,The whole family watched and enjoyed it. It is not the old Scooby Doo voices like Casey Casem days but the more updated version of Scooby Doo. The story was original and kept moving. We would recommend it to others who enjoy Scooby Doo mysteries.
1,Parents beware,My five-year old son used to love Scooby Doo until this movie. The bad guy in this cartoon was a knife wielding psychopath in a camp like setting. It was very adult like; way too much for my child. He had trouble sleeping for months and still references the bad guy from the bad Scooby Doo episode from time to time. Avoid.
3,"Fast delivery, good purchase but.....","Fast delivery, smooth purchase. Book was in good conditions but it has a lot of handwriting all over the pages."
3,CD Player,"It is a nice cd player, but very phiniky. Has trouble reading alot of cds, especially if there if fingerprints on them."
2,NOT CONSISTENT,GREAT PRICE BUT DOES NOT PLAY ALL MP3 GENERATED BURNED DISCS.THESE DISCS WERE PROPERLY FORMULATED ALL FROM THE SAME SOURCE.
2,Will not read injet printable CDs,"This unit will not read injet printable CDs. I tried burning new ones using a different burner. No help. It plays other CDs, no problem. Had Amazon replace with another unit. It has same problem. I don't know what could cause this."
1,No Disc Read,"I bought one of these CD players hoping for a solid, straightforward, single disc player, but I am extremely disappointed with it. I cannot play the majority of my CDs. The ""no disc read"" keeps appearing. I can play all my discs in the car and others' CD players, but not on this machine. Often I have to resort to playing them on my DVD player. Unfortunately, I noticed all this after the 30-day return policy date expired. I would not recommend it."
1,100% Junk,"This is a piece of crap - it plays store bought CD's fine, but don't even bother trying to play mp3's on it (it skips over some, won't play others, etc). I returned it, and got a thirty-five dollar (shipped to my door) DVD/CD-R/mp3 player from WalMart, it works perfectly, and plays mp3's all day long.On the plus side, J&R; Music and Computer World refunded all my money (the whole refund process took a week).Once I got my refund, I bought the below unit from Amazon instead - it works great, sounds great... and I'm REALLY happy with it.Sony CDP-CE500 Compact Disc Playerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NQU4YY/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00"
2,Takes too long to load and play,I use CDs in a university class and I don't like to waste students' time by waiting for the ESP to function - I take it off and it still doesn't load any faster - sometimes up to 45 seconds. I wish I could return it. The old saying is still true - you get what you pay for.
3,just the facts,"As this book is more of an in-depth research paper concerning all things Blackbeard, it deals mostly with litigation and politics surrounding his life. That is what all the known public records deal with, and that is almost all that is in this book. The last 75 pages are footnotes. It's well-researched and interesting if you want that level of information."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,I should have took the negative reviews seriously and not bought this piece of junk. After two weeks it doesn't stick to my guitar anymore. It keeps falling off so now I can either throw it away or use it as a paper weight. I'm sure there are loads of better tuners out there and cheaper as well. Shame on Sabine for putting out this junk.
5,"a readable, interesting art book","Any book about art or an artist that doesn't make me fall asleep gets five stars from me. The only downside (but it still gets five stars) as that you don't get the full representation of the pictures and need to look at the description to see the medium. For example the foil overlay. Still wonderful. (Feb 17, 2008)I eventually found a small, beautiful, cloth-bound catalogue of his Australian and New Zealand exhibitions (the one I have was produced in 1973 by cicero, gmbh and titled 'Hundertwasser 1974 Australia') and there you get glimpse of the phosphoric metallic brilliance that I find missing in many of the books about Hundertwasser - although for the price of these books, no complaint. This book and the catalogue are a good combination. The catalogue I was able to find at a very reasonable price of $30, but it took a bit of searching. (April 16, 2008)"
3,found wanting,"This is a nice portfolio of prints of his artwork. It only covers twelve of his paintings, and one print of the poster he did of the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna. Although there are very few pages, they are quite large, and have beautiful colors. This is definately coffee-table sized. This portfolio contains very little. Would have liked to see more of his architecture."
5,An Absolute Must...,"I picked this up, sealed, in a bargain bin, for $3.00.Had no idea who Elmo Hope was.I bought it thinking I would use the empty jewel case to replace a broken one I have.Fast forward three months, and this is the title most often played in my collection. I find myself taking it from the car into the house because I can't stop listening.Based on this set alone, this man should be as well know as contemporary and boyhood friend Bud Powell. I enjoy this set more then any of my Powell collections. (Though of course I am a great Bud Powell fan also. How can you not be?)I cannot say enough good about this set. The mastering is outstanding. Even though it is chronological, the tracks flow perfectly.Back when I worked at a CD store, there were certain discs I would guarantee people would like. This would fall into that catagory. If you like jazz piano in a trio setting, you will end up an Elmo Hope convert the same way I did. Pick this one up and thank me later."
5,Chicken Wings,This is a light hearted look at the world of small airplane driving and the strange folks that inhabit that world. The sometimes dumb but lovable folks and their antics are easily identified with in the real world aviation community. Most pilots will know an ego-maniacal airplane driver like Chuck who pulls his foolish antics regularly.
2,Yep- not too good.,"Reminds me of Bad Religion with less interesting tunes, and lyrics that are simultaneously easier to understand and more pretentious. The tune on ""Short Music for Short People""-- all 20 seconds of it-- was much better than this entire album."
2,Very average aftershave,"I was looking for a moderately priced aftershave that has some character. This one had good ratings from quite a few people. However, I was disappointed. It's more in the category of Gillette and Nivia and does not deserve the pricing it has. It does have some faint aroma, but it only lasts less than an hour. Plus it has push-down squirt, which is not inconvenient, but will also leave a good amount of aftershave unusable in the end.My search continues..."
3,OK Story - Very Nationalistic,"Told form the perspective of an 18 year old crew member, this memoir focuses on the horseplay and ""extra curricular"" escapades of a junior enlisted man on a German U-Boat in WWII. The author maintains a very pro-German perspective and ignores the atrocities committed in the course of the war.There are many other much better WWII memoirs available."
4,German U boat 505 and WW2,"An excellent account of the exploits of the German U boat, 505 during World War 2 and it`s subsequent capture by the American navy. Worth a read."
4,A good WWII read from th prespective of the Germans,It is an interesting view of WWII U-boat war from a crewman's perspective. How did they get men to go down in those boats?
5,What a fascinating piece of history.,"Having toured U-505 at the Chicago Museum of History and Industry, I found Goebeler's personal experience of what it was like to serve aboard this boat most compelling and interesting."
4,Good Historical view from the other sides point of view.,It was a very good perspective of a young German boy who matured in the service of his country in the U-Boat navy.
4,Worth a look,Reading the book has made me want to go tour the sub in Chicago. Nice level of detail and a quick read.
1,Not particularly exciting,"I picked this book up on a whim, the cover looked cool, and I wish I hadn't. This book was my first, and last, foray into the Kris LongKnife novels. The only character development in the book consisted of everyone telling LongKnife what a great person she was. That got real old after the 57th time that somebody brought up the ""great"" Longknife tradition. The space battles were entertaining, but seemed to drag in parts. The rest of the book was a bewildering collection of contrived scenes. If you're looking for a great sci-fi series to get into, check out David Weber's Honor Harrington series. Its everything that Mike Shepard is trying to mold the Kris Longknife novels into."
3,Good for a Naval Weapons Officer,"While it was a quick read, it was a rather obvious conclusion. I liked the issue of a young Naval officer woman trying to live up to her famous family. Obvious strings that should have been addressed were left unfinished clearly for later books in the series. I would have liked to have seen a little more character development but perhaps space operas are heavy on action and lite on relationships. A good read!"
5,"Great Characters, so-so editing",Have read 5 of the Kris Longknife books and will buy the rest of the series. What makes this series is the excellent characters and the fast pacing. I'm grammar picky and often find word mis-usage (udders vs utters) and typos. Shepherd needs a better editor but those details are often funny and don't detract from the overall pleasure of the books.
1,Not Steve Martin's best ... by far,"I am not sure why this movie has received such high ratings from other reviewers. This movie is well below average for Steve Martin and is, at best, an average B movie. I can see how the movie would appeal to my daughter (age four), but fail to see how an adult might derive any enjoyment from it. Go figure."
5,This movie is a mixture between...,"obvious humor and subtle, quirky zings you have to pay attention to ""get"". A good movie for the entire family. I sat with mine, ages 14 through 45, and we all enjoyed it greatly!"
1,Reiner could care less about his fans,"Carl Reiner COULD'VE made sure this classic comedy was done right on DVD but obviously Carl Reiner could care less and likes to RIP PEOPLE OFF. If you ask me Carl Reiner (especially his political wacko Meathead son) are THE JERKS.Thanks for nothing and ripping off one of your past fans.This HORRIBLE DVD version should be burned and everybody who bought it should be able to get their money back. NOT IN WIDESCREEN, GOOD SCENCES WERE DELETED, AND IT HAS A BAD PICTURE TRANSFER, ALL IN MONO SOUND!!Thanks for nothing Meathead'sfather.Steve Martin should take part of the blame also for allowing this horrible dvd to be released to unsuspecting fans that wasted their hard earned money on it.I'l beware from now on when buying ANY dvd from Steve Martin or especially any Reiner's.You could tape this off cable tv and get a WAY BETTER picture, sound, etc."
2,"""Full Screen"" means HALF SCREEN",Full-screen means you lose about 50% of the picture (and still pay full price). It's one of the greatest and funniest movies ever made but I will not allow myself to be ripped off by paying for the 'full screen' edition. The stars are for the movie. The three missing ones are all because of the way it is presented.
1,Did I miss something?,"Here's what this book never explained: if you are WILLING to cook at all, you can cook anything you want. So why do you need this book? You don't. Cooking for yourself is a personal hurdle that you either accomplish or you don't. If you can get to the point of cooking at all, then you don't need this book...the world is at your dutch oven. The advice in the book is nothing that you haven't read in ANY magazine that you can pick up, whether it's a men's health magazine or even any ladies magazine. The recipes may as well have been gleaned from the same pages as those same magazines. There was NOTHING in this book new. This was a major league disappointment."
1,I been SUPERSIZED with a load of bull,"After reading this book make me wonder if the two what wrote this book really be athletes or if they stay running one step ahead of the law. Sister give me this book cause she know I like to eat. And I do exercise. But this book stank so bad if you hold it next to the food you eating, you lose your appetite, and maybe your meal before that."
2,Overall A Disappointment,"After the three exquisite single releases from her equally exquisite LIGHT YEARS set, it borders on idiotic as to why anyonewould choose this limp track as the final release from the album.The song is average at best, by far the lowpoint of an otherwiseseamless set. Catering to the then-popular Latin music movement,the Latino vibes fail to enhance what is already a DOA track--I'mnot sure if it's the music, lyrical content, or production, butit nonetheless adds up to the usually-reliable Minogue's mostuninteresting single in ages, and quite possibly ever."
2,please go...,"Ok so PLEASE STAY may not have been the best choice for a single. Get this cd if only for the video extra. Do not get it for the remixes. Oh Kylie, great dance diva, remix vamp extraordinaire. What happened? The remixes are horrible!!! Probably the worst I've heard in a long time, and for Kylie that's rare. She's known for having some of the best remixes. If anything get cd1 for the non-lp tracks and the nifty calendar."
3,Light reading for academic types,"Two sisters-- one natural, one adopted-- engage in a series of trials and love affairs that lead them from strange coincidences into the truth.Light reading, but smart enough to feel like you aren't wasting your time. This is my first Trapido, and while I found her a talented writer, I didn't find anything really special about the book-- sort of a cut-rate Drabble or Murdoch. All the same, an entertaining enough read."
2,Halloween clock,Face/dial very nice - clock works but scary sounds are intermittant and do not always work - went all day on Halloween with only twice hearing the sounds.
4,Ehhhhh,"This toy is kind of okay. 4 things about this toy#1 It's a bit to over weight#2 Has only 1 earbud#3 Abosutely fun for kids#4 Dropped it, cracked"
4,Some come back...,"It's been twelve years since Jim Capaldi's last great studio album,""Some Come Running""(1988).His new work is worth the wait,surprising the listener with a very concise and disciplined rock,and also with some hints at his past work with Traffic.As always,there's a lot of soulfulness in Capaldi's music-he has a certain hopeful and shining vision,emerging in articulate songwriting.This time around those invited to the party include:Gary Moore,Deep Purple's master drummer Ian Paice,Steve Winwood,and George Harrison;the last two were heard on ""Some Come Running"" as well."
5,Great Showmanship Movie!!,"Beau Bridges superbly performs P T Barnum who from his impoverished begginings to properity and wealth is the 1800's King of Showmanship and founder of the famous Barnum and Bailey Three Ring Circus as he master's his gift to attract,amuse and mystify an Audience into the biggest show ever!!"
4,Man this stuff grooves!,"Throw yourself back to the late sixties and early seventies! Unfortunately I missed out on all of this scene, as this was during the time I was born! The album covers are worth the price of admission! The best ""hippest"" tracks are towards the end which is quite unusual as the best stuff is usually found at the beginning of albums. The cuts Roaring Twenties and Omar Khayyam really get your toes a tapping! Also check out the albums (CDs) Sound Gallery 1, Music For TV Dinners: The 60's, & Beat Tempo if you are into ""mod"" music. Wish this type of groovy jazzy sound would make a revival! Well at least you can still listen to it whenever the mood hits you! So put on your bell bottoms, Nehru Jacket, flash the peace sign, grab yourself a kicky girl and get a go-going, man!"
4,Glenn Hughes builds the machine quite well!!!,"Ok, let me start saying this: It`s been a long time since I first heard this album but it stands as one of my favourite Hughes albums. I bought this album right after it came out here in Norway. I was very into Glenn Hughes and his voice from albums such as Deep Purple-Burn and Stormbringer, and Since that I have always been a hugh fan of his. Ok, I bought this album in exitement of hearing his voice in the age of 50 i suppose and was trilled about how good it was!!!! I couldn`t believe what I was hearing!!!! That voice is amazing and now i can understand that people call him: The Voice Of Rock. The music is also very good. It Rocks big time. This was a very big surprise for me, because I had never heard anything from him since his Deep Purple days. This is a must for all Glenn Hughes fans"
5,Exceptional,These books are excellent. Can't wait to read the next one. Great writing and wonderful reading books. I hate Amazon's x number of words required. I said what I wanted to say.
4,What a journey!,"Jonathan Rundman's ""Sound Theology 1"" is a treasure of an album, or should I say, a cask of treasures. Yeah, sure it has some tracks that don't hold up, but most of them do, and do so admirably. And as a whole (especially when listened to with its twin, ""Sound Theology 2"") it satisfies not only the yearnings of the ear and mind but that deep yearning of the soul for authentic songs that deal with the subjects of life, love, and the Divine.Rundman is like a jeweler who appreciates the gem for its natural uncut beauty. He does not over-polish his work, thus allowing the listener to find the beauty within the interplay between the music and lyric. Rundman let's his music flow from the genuiness that is his life, and thus holds forth with what he sees as truth. You cannot get more authentic than that, and it can be heard on every song, making this a must hear album!"
1,I am disappointed.,I am very disappointed with this book. alot of the so called facts are wrong. You have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the answer key. If you plan to enter a trivia contest with it you better find another place to get your facts.
5,Covers Pet Odors Well,"We have 2 dogs and usually nobody that comes into our house can tell but lately they have been acting ""bad"". So we have been looking for something to cover the smell up and we tried several carpet deodarizers, sprays and powders. I came across this stuff in the dollar store on sale at the time and decided to try it knowing that arm and hammer works well with eliminating odors, and it worked great! Although it is very powerfull it smells great and our dogs had no problems with it I will definitely be buying it again!"
3,Great for knowledge,This book is pretty technical and great for a general and advanced knowledge of soap making. I however found it a bit disappointing that it had more knowledge than actual soap recipies and no photos.
2,"The tops ""A to Z"" book in soap making","Whether a neophyte or an old salt, this is simply the most comprehensive book on soap making from start to finish. Written neither in a ""Ned and the Primer"" style nor in an officous manner, it is packed with both simplicity and a wealth of information, wisdom and understanding that lends greatly to new appreciation of the soap making craft."
4,The Soapmaker's Companion,I was looking for a book that would teach a beginner saop maker how to make soap. This is an excellent book with lots of recipes and a thorough education on the art of making soap.
5,Rock meets Blue Grass,"A friend gave me this CD because he loved it so much. At first I was a little sketchy because I don't love twangy music but listening to it got me hooked. Right off the bat, he sounds like Eddie Veder & the guy from REM. As the CD goes on, it goes back and forth between rock and blue grass, adding the twang at all of the right parts! His lyrics were awesome & his voice is so smooth and versatile any qualms I had disappeared within the first couple of minutes. If you want a calming rock CD that still has an edge, buy it!"
5,Awesome in concert,"Mark McKay's ""Nothing Personal"" is great, but he is even better live in concert. I saw him open for Frog Holler and everyone in the room was perfectly still and listening. It was amazing. His music has a real hypnotic and strong effect. The music is rock and roll but also has an alternative vibe, slightly, somehow. It's very dark and moody. Kind of like Whiskeytown. His voice too is very smooth. I cannot explain this so I can only recommend that he should be seen in concert, and whether you can or not, definitely buy the cd online here today."
4,Great Album,This is a great cd no matter who you are but most especially if you are a Del fan. Buy it for a third of the price however straight from the source at Hieroglyphics.com.Lyric Lickin' is my favorite song on the album but its good all around.
2,No Way Del's Best Work.,"Man, it really makes me sad. I have liked Del since MY BROTHER GEORGE... and the video for Misterbobdobalina; but this is the worst.There is nothing really good I can say about this album besides it is really that long.Don't buy it if you want to hear what Del and Heiroglyphics are capable of. This album is a poor representation of a great artist."
2,Just Going Through The Motions,"Steve Windwood has added alot to the pop music scene. Unfortunately his efforts on this disc don't hit on all cylinders. Some of the rhythms are pretty catchy particularly on Hearts of Fire, Holdin' On, and Don't You Know What The Night Can Do. However, the lyrics are extremely basic throughout this eight song collection. And the overuse of the synthesizer is just plain annoying. Try some of Stevie's other work such as Back In The High Life or John Barley Corn, Low Spark from his Traffic days."
3,AIrstyle Wireless,"I bought this controller several months ago instead of waiting for the Logitech Action Controller to be released. Works great except that I get dropped signals because my PS2 is off to the side and not directly next to, in front of, on top of, or below the TV. If you have a large object (like my buddy Mark) in between the Airstyle and the receiver, expect to get a dropped signal."
3,it's okay,"Bought this book recently and was slightly disappointed mainly b/c many of her ideas seem a bit cheesy. A few sugestions even made me wonder if I'd look like a total dork for doing what she recommended. If you lean towards sappy this is your book but for those who aren't, don't waste your money."
3,The Grooming of Alice By Phyliss Reynolds,"I thought this book was an ok book because it is about a 14 year old an she was ok. Alice is a girl in the 8th grade. When there was only one week befor schoolended Alice and her friends realize that they needed to look good for highschool. So, they started excercising and by the end of the summer they started noticing some results. The only part I did not like about this book was when she kissed patrik on th eye lid."
5,Alice Rules!,"All the Alice books are really cool. She is a teenage girl whose probs are totally realistic. In ""The Grooming of Alice"" Alice volunteers at a hospital, helps deal with Elizabeth, who might be anorexic, and Pamela who is having a family crisis. Even with the obstacles along the way, the summer before high school is a good one for Alice. Reccomended to anyone who wants a funny read!"
5,The Grooming of Alice,I am a big fan of the Alice series and have read each book a number of times each. Before this book the books seemed kinda unrealistic. Like some of the stuff they did I never would do. But in this one it talks about the disese anorexia. I think it is good to educate kids about that cause I know someone that has that and it has TOTALLY ruined their life. So I really recomend this book to everybody.
2,not the best....,I expected better from a brand such as Yamaha. As soon as the year warranty expired so did the drive!
4,Near Perfect Unit,"I've burned several CDs with the unit now, and it is super fast. Works very well, and I only have one problem with it. It never burns at 24x, as it blames the media used. I have tried cds up to 32x, and it drops to 16x. That's still smokin' fast."
5,a superb final constribution by carl sagan,"a readable, comprehesible, and absorbing work the the greatest science writer ever, with a very moving constribution by his wife."
5,Excellent Movie!,This movie is terrific and for anybody who has spirituality and faith. Jeffrey Hunter is great in this role and you can't help but be moved by this movie.
1,didn't help,My parents have this book...it didn't help them. They are divorced now. Thanks for nothing.
4,Intense Journey,This book is heavy and necessary. Be prepared for an intense journey. DaveDavidson.com
2,God's word has the real answers,"I read this book nearly 10 years ago when I was dating someone who was addicted to porn. Although the book helped me to deal with my own hurt by finding someone who understood my pain, in the end, focusing on my pain was a dead end. I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who shared that instead of turning to books or people, she went back to the Bible and of course to God. God's word is what helped me to overcome and make the right choices for my situation. I moved on and have no regrets."
3,Ideal for a case enthusiast,"I doubt this book will do much to win the hearts and minds of those new to this case. Elchols remains his own worst enemy on many levels. Who, in his circle of influence, thought publically releasing this work was a good idea?That aside, this book is a must have for anyone fascinated by the case. If writing this was a cathartic process for Damien and ultimately helps fund his defense. I wish him the peace and justice he deserves."
1,Would not bother,I wouldn't read anything from this man if someone paid me to. I don't believe a word from him whether it's verbal or written.
3,Workshop prose,"Ms. Chang's book Hunger has moments of genuine fresh prose but on the whole it seemed a fair representation of the kind of MFA program writing that is clogging publishing today. One wishes for the spontaneity of story telling exemplified by Ha Jin, and other writers of the Chinese/American immigration experience. Instead, one is left with the feeling Ms. Chang workshopped this novella and stories for too long a portion of her young life, and might have worn away the originality of her writing stone in the polishing. Let's hope her subsequent work springs from the heart--not class."
1,not happy,I ordered a metal detector which was a piece of junk.You have to touch the metal before it will beep.The shipping was the same as the price of the detector $79.95 and on the package it was marked under $30.00 for shipping.I tried to cancel the order right away and it was not possible.I did get a call from the detector company and the left a number to call which I will do.not happyJohn
1,Please don't waste ur money or time,"Take it from me, I have already done it and it is not worth it...First of all, it is unauthorized, poor quality film, and is just a bunch of pics put together and is narrated by someone who has the nerve to not even know how to pronounce certain words!!!!When she mispronounced (the narrator) and I was getting annoued with the poor quality film, I just turned it off!! I didnt even watch the whole thing and I won't!!I only gave it one star because I couldnt give it 0!!!"
3,Would be a better book if he weren't trying a hatchet job on Rizzuto!,"Actually, I liked a lot about this book. But early on, he claims that he doesn't mean the book to be a putdown of Phil Rizzuto, and he then proceeds to put Rizzuto down in chapter after chapter. Even when his statistics seem to justify Rizzuto's inclusion in the Hall, he then claims that the statistics are not to be trusted -- a strange case of having one's cake and eating it! And the very last thing in his book is a statement that Rizzuto doesn't belong in the Hall. This is unbiased? I think not.Excluding the hatchet job on Phil Rizzuto, it's an interesting book. It goes into the history of the Hall, tries to come up with criteria for Hall of Fame membership (distinguishing what he might like them to be from what has guided the selectors), and presents a lot of statistics (which, of course, is what James is famous for). If he'd been more neutral on Rizzuto, the book might have gotten a higher rating."
1,This book had a chance and James choked in the clutch!,"The Baseball Hall of Fame is full of paradoxes and Bill James turns into a literary paradoxical decomposition throughout this effort. Nevermind the man is not at all funny as he uses poor choices in language (do not read this book to young children), but turns his book into a paradoxical attack on ""Scooter"" Rizzuto and manages to trash Don Drysdale and a few others. If one is seeking the good and the bad along with a history of the HOF voting and members, then prepare to be left in scoring position; you may not be able to finish this book."
4,"Quick, straight forward helpful advice","If you are even thinking of even buying a condo, townhouse or condo, this book is a definite buy. It's definitely worth the price to educate yourself about some things to look out for when looking to buy. It is in a question/answer/tip/trap quick and to the point format. I bought the book because it was recommended as one of the top ten real estate books to buy in the real estate section in the Washington Post for 2000. Highly recommend."
2,"Somewhat helpful, lots of filler","Like all the books I've read on this subject, you'll get some useful advice, but you'll have to wade through a lot of filler."
3,full of entertaiment because smith is the hell of a nice gu,"david top onamadeIheard this music the 9th day of september lastyear,when i heard it i felt like been a musician because the guy really impressed me with the music,then i planed to find out about the film too, and some weeks after i was succesful.infact i was really impressed with the way smith acted in the film too .so now anytime i remind myself of the film i will then switch on my radio may be i'm gonna be a lucky one tohear the MIB music that particular moment.fortunate enough amazon.com is a very good site and they were always serving me well. so i will be glad to have the cd (MIB)."
1,Very bad condition,The book is in a horrible condition.. All the paper are fallen of the book.. Couldn't use it had to take copy of it
4,Really great book.,"This was a very interesting book. I am in advertising and I think it helped a lot to think about how to get people to agree with you. It might sound a bit sleazy, but that is, in effect, what most jobs and success is about. It is not about manipulating people, rather to convey your message in the best way for acceptance.Good for anyone in business, I highly recommend."
4,Reasoning behind the actions,Great reference to understand the whys of individual behaviors and thus provides possible means to deal with those behaviors.
5,A CLASSIC on INFLUENCE and PERSUASION,"This book is a classic in the area of influence.It deals with only 6 tools of persuasion, but it does a mightily good job out of it.The tools, or weapons, as they are called in this book are: reciprocation, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority and scarcity. The examples of these tools, as used in practice, provided in this book are enlightening and eye-opening.Whether or not you are involved in influence and persuasion professionally - you will find it very useful to recognize when someone might attempt to use these tools of influence and persuasion on you.After all these ""weapons"" are the tools used in sales, advertising, and marketing and you're bound to encounter them in your life."
3,"pretty good, but there is better","If you are just getting into sales, this is a good start. More advanced students would benefit from books like ""Maximum Influence"" and ""The 8th Habit."""
3,Its. Okay,Its one of THE manyThee al know or stem to knowBut do thee realyWell many of This books are al coppies of other books in This geneAll i van say its okay
5,An Absolute Must-Read,"INFLUENCE: The Psychology of Persuasion is quite possibly the most systematic study of the tools of persuasion ever written. It contains many, many examples from everyday life of the techniques used by Compliance Professionals to effect behavioral change.At the conclusion of each chapter, Dr. Cialdini provides insight into how to recognize when these tools are being used against us. He then offers guidance on avoiding unwillingly falling prey to those trained to employ persuasion techniques in the attainment of their own, often selfish, goals. The writing style is highly enjoyable and the lessons in the book thereby easily digested.The book is well researched and thoughtfully presented, and its instructive style is sure to have a profound effect on the activities of anyone who is fortunate enough to experience it."
4,Interesting read,Influence is an interesting read that deviates from my main reading. I haven't had a chance to read a lot of social psychology but this book really caught my interest. As there are both examples and references to studies made in the past as well as stories from readers it makes a pleasant introduction to the persuasion part of social psychology field without being overly complex or academic.
3,"Hardly a ""revision""","With a 2006 publication date, one would expect that this book would contain recent research. Alas, the most recent reference is 1992! The principles in this book are sound, and the author's writing style is engaging, but the examples he uses are clearly dated. Surely he could have done a little more homework to make this truly a revised edition, not just slap a new cover on it."
3,Basically Common Sense Approach,There's actually very few book on the subject of persuasion - most are written for the sales department and take that particularly aggressive approach liked by sales management and trainers who long left the coalface of real selling and continue to use the terminology of war tactics and strategy. Personally I never quite understood the mentality of 'attacking' markets and 'controlling' clients. However this is an interesting addition to the conversation and pulls together quite a few examples and analogies. Overall though I feel this hasn't been written in the heat of actual persuasive discussion. It feels more like a course for baby sales and marketing people still in college.Buy the book if you're creating a library on the subject (it's been around a long time so it can't be all iffy) - but there are plenty more to reasearch.
4,What's the difference between several version of the book?,"I read Influence: the new psychology of modern persuasion, a 1984 Quill version. I wonder what's the difference between different versions about this or similar book? Is 1984 content outdated?"
4,Seminal Work!,"As my title suggests, this book really is the seminal work for anyone interested in the field of persuasion and influence.However, it is more than just that. Exponentially more. It is essential for anyone that wants to be more and more aware of how they are influenced and the way in which human beings respond to a great many stimuli.It really does belong on everyones book shelf as a book to read over and over and also to use a reference.Adam Eason, Psychology of Persuasion Licensee"
1,I Would NEVER Purchase One Of These Again!!!,"I purchased a $200 gift card to give as a Christmas gift. I decided not to give the card and then attempted to use the card myself. I was told that the number was no good. After attempts to get this resolved I was told that the card had been used by an unauthorized party. The card had never left my possession, so I know noone other than myself ever saw it. I don't know if they issued the same number to more than one person, or if I was just scammed. Either way, I am out $200 and was told that I would need to contact my credit card company to file a claim. Well, it's been 10 months since I purchased the card so it appears that I am just out $200. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to purchasing this. It seems I'm not the only person that this has happened to!!!!"
2,Gift Card Nightmare,"I received an Amazon Gift Card as a workplace gift in August 2012. I'd previously ordered many products through Amazon with no problems. After placing my order using the gift card I could immediately tell the system hadn't applied my gift card to the order. After a couple of emails and one extended phone conversation I was told by Amazon CS on 8-10-12 that my gift card amount would be credited to my credit card. I checked with my bank on 8-22-12 and no credit was posted. I once again contacted Amazon CS and got yet another email reply saying my gift card amount would be applied to my credit card, in 4 or 5 business days. Exactly what I'd already been told back on August 10. I have yet to see any satisfactory resolution from my customer service runaround."
5,This offering does not disappoint,"I have enjoyed Ken Tamplin's style of singing (wide vocal range with great pitch and control) and fast and accurate lead guitar playing from his days in Shout up to the present day. The lyrical content of his songs also are a very positive spin on what has become generally a negative view on life, where he is not afraid to deliver the truth. This offering, Wake The Nations does not disappoint at all. Good range of musical styles from hard driving rock to mellow melodic rock. One goes away from listening to this cd being built up with hope for a better day after confronting our here and now in the light of Love. Best tracks ( even though all tracks are excellent )are The Story Of Love, Falling Houses, God In Heaven and Every Day Is Precious. Highly recommended"
2,"Yes, I think it's lop-sided too.","As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?"
2,Stereotypical character development,"1000 White Women is one of my favorite books so I read this in anticipation of another great read. However, it's not very good. The premise of the story is similar to 1WW (taking a tiny piece of history and fictionalizing a story around it) but the plot is rather predictable and the character development relies on silly xenophobic stereotypes with rather ridiculous dialog."
2,Credibility inconsistent,"Ned is the best character and he holds your interest throughout the book. The premise of the book is appealing, However most of the other characters were laughable, and so I did. Especially Tilley who in that time would still be in the closet."
2,Overrated,"The examples are woefully few and too easy. You cannot figure out most problems without consulting other books or online notes.The exposition is sometimes good, but often confusing and unclear. Maybe it is because the book has two authors.The book is overrated and I would not recommend it."
3,only so much possible in an helicopter !,"Would have liked the storyline to have been a little more developed. It relies a bit on flashbacks to fill it out. Only so much possible in an helicopter I suppose ! Still I'd have liked to have seen development of relationship with girl- There was opportunity for that at the end. It all ended a bit too soon for me. I was wanting it to go on. David Janssen was absolutely fine, & wanted to carry on watching him. Sadly that was not possible in film or real life."
4,wish they kept the 3 fishes,"i watched it today and i was disappointed that the songs had been changed, the dialog seemed different, it even seemed to be missing a flying sequence."
4,Intriguing romance,"Adventure, mystery, a historical setting are all attributes that combine to make this romance intriguing and fun to read. Discover the background, goals, motives, and desires of the main characters J.W. Walford and Louisa Burgess as their lives cross paths in East Texas shortly after the Civil War. Follow their relationship as they form a pact that takes them to San Antonio. Each of them has his/her own agenda. These agendas will surely affect any long term relationship that could develop. Find out where Tess Ramsdale, Claire, Morgan, Dalhart, and Diamond fit it and affect the outcome of this novel. A good read for the summer!"
4,Previous Reviews,"I read previous reviews on this product so I was nervous. I had to get a couple sizes up, so go by the waist description not the size."
5,Excellent!,"This is truly a movie masterpiece. My brother and I were entranced by this mini-series when we were little and after years of searching I was finally able to find it again. The first three installments are better than the final two, as they cover the early childhood years and the American Revolution. The whole series is of excellent quality and very historically accurate. The primary historical source for the series is the biography on George Washington by James Thomas Flexner, which is very thorough and the most noted in the field. I actually wish there were a soundtrack available as the music is very fine as well. The series appeals to both the young and old, oddly enough, the under ten crowd is as entranced by this historical series as anyone can be. It is truly magnificent."
4,"Complete book, incomplete ending","An incomplete ending does not a bad book make...it's just that most of us read mystery genre novels to provide a tidy little wrap-up to life's puzzles--a situation which, frustratingly, doesn't exist in our real lives. So, along comes William Krueger with Mercy Falls, and our expectations are denied. YOu can sense the frustration in some of these reviews--'how DARE he?', etc., etc. Interesting--because Krueger does solve the mystery, and answer the puzzling questions, just as our expectations demand. What he doesn't do is provide a 'happily ever after'. Instead, he leaves traumatized good people with a long period of recovery, a bad guy hellbent on revenge, and a hero in hiding. Of course that's a frustrating ending...but it's a real life, meaningful ending from an excellent writer of a very fine book."
3,Action starts on page 64,"A little slow start but then it starts to get interesting. If you like Cork, worth reading. Krueger's writing definitely improves over time. In any case, I almost long to camp in those forests. If only I could take a warm shower at night!"
3,Good but....wanted more history and philosophy,"This book was good, but I think the author could have delved into a little more history and some more of the philosophical aspects of tai kwon do."
1,My download has not still come through...,I have not yet been able to download this album... What is going on with this! Very frustrating and im extremely pissed off I waisted 8 dollars on this...
5,A great collection to have.,"If you love the series and haven't gotten the movies yet, now is your chance! The box set is great for someone who wants all of the movies and doesn't want to buy them separately. It's also a great value."
5,Great DVD package,"The DVD's are in a thinner plastic case and all 6 are in a box sleeve. Really compact. Wouldn't it be great if all DVD's were like that, allowing for more in a smaller storage area. This is a great addition to my collection and will be fun to watch again and again. This package is definitely a best buy."
3,Harry Potter Years 1-6 Giftset [Blu-ray],"The blu ray is ver good, although the wrapping and the words a in the UK languange. The company that sold this product (Electronica Direct) has to import their poducts form the UK, and that is why the packaging is different."
1,Harry Potter years 1-6,disk 2 is corrupted and doesn't play. disk 5 is defective and some chapters freeze up making it necessary to skip forward. all and all not that great a deal...
5,Great Gift for children (or in my case... Husband),"I got this on a lightning deal and couldn't be happier with the price for this product. My husband watches every HP movie on tv he can find, which leaves me sometimes frustrated, so I got him his own Blu-Ray DVDs for Christmas so the movie will end faster without those pesky tv commercials. Shipped and packaged nicely."
5,Family favorite,Great that Harry can be had in a 1-6 Giftset containing all the movies... in BLU-RAY! Now my 4 kids will want to watch them all over again (hooray!). Get the popcorn ready!
3,Busted Cases,The Discs themselves were in excellent condition but the cases and box itself look like someone drove over it with a car.
5,Harry Potter Giftset,The movies are great. We just started watching the movies a few months ago and was excited when the movie was added to the set. My children are reading the books now and they like to compare the movies to the books. This is a great buy.
5,Great Value for Great Movies,"This is a great gift set for anyone who would like to own the first six Potter films without all the fluff. While the movies do have some special features like deleted scenes and some interviews, these are not the two disk versions with hours of bonus material. Each DVD comes in its own case (the extra-thin kind) and then all six fit into the bigger box. I've had no issues with any of my DVDs and I was glad to find that there were the usual standard features to accompany the movies. I found this to be a really great value, especially if you're wanting a set to tide you over until all of the films are released together"
5,Loved it,"I got it for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. You couldn't beat the price either, much much cheaper than in the stores"
2,Missing parts in movies,"The box is basic which is fine, there are parts missing in the movies, some parts actually seem pertinant if you are into how deep the HP shows go. I wish I would have spent extra to get the full shows."
5,Blu Ray only...,"I keep reading reviews about how this set is not for ""real fans."" I grew up with Harry Potter...started reading the books when I was 12, went to see Sorcerer's Stone at midnight when it opened, and I have to say, I disagree. I already have the special edition versions in SD format, but I really wanted to get all the FILMS on Blu Ray. I don't mind if the special features are missing. I got a great deal, so it doesn't matter -that- much, especially when I've seen all the special edition footage anyway."
5,great deal,"Wanted to buy the Harry Potter movie set before the last 2 come out. This was a great deal. No special features, but I don't really watch those anyway."
4,Great set,"We had a ""Potter-a-thon"" once the set arrived. Great fun. The only drawback I saw was that some of the earlier movies did not have a ""menu"" screen. They just started playing automatically. No big deal and didn't effect movie quality."
4,Harry Potter years 1-6,Was delighted to purchase all the current years at one time. Doesn't contain a bunch of extras but the movies were what we wanted.
1,Harry Potter DVD,"It was an awful experience, bad quality and one the tapes Part III was actually Polar Express. I have sent it back two weeks ago, but still have not got my refund."
3,Amazon 2010 Shopping Experience,"My 2010 on-line shopping experience with Amazon has been a mixed bag. Amazon had most every item I was looking for and it was convenient to order from home but when I had a problem I found them unresponsive. As an example, Amazon is running a credit card promotional sponsored by Chase bank and also pushing their own store card through GE Credit. When I ordered a Kindle for my wife it was not clear how to take advantage of the Chase promotional and I ended up with the non-promotional Amazon store card. The Customer Service response was ""so sorry YOU did not click on the correct option."" My Amazon assessment; Barnes & Noble has the Nook available locally and you know the terms of the purchase. Alternately, I can read both Kendle and Nook e-books on my iPad. For electronics I find that B&H Photo has comparable priced electronics and their customer service is much better."
1,terrible quality DVDs,4 out 6 DVDs are deleted and some scenes. Never buy any DVD movies from Amazon ever again!
5,Great Sounds,"Again, Tift Merritt delivers some great sounds. The combination of her sweet voice coupled with the sounds of her strong band is what makes for some of the best music in country. It's her songs we should be hearing more often on the top 40. But like so many other obscure talented song writers and singers, Tift is left in obscurity on CMT or GAC and their award shows."
4,"Doesn't Make Me Forget Bramble Rose, But....","This is a rocking album, and Tift's vocals are still hers alone. This album does remind me of Dusty in Memphis and you can hear the influence of Dusty in Tift's vocals and style, but there's an original artist here who is still developing. Maybe I'm in the minority but I thought Bramble Rose was really a resonant album that got better and better after many listenings. This album comes off initially as a cut below....something you'd put on at a party, or listen to along with a Tom Petty album. Or maybe like it's trying too hard to be the ""breakout"" album. But, settling into it, the album does what it does awfully well, that band is tight, and she's a very deft songwriter who is just going to get better with time. And her singing is mezmerizing and those other adjectives that mean you want to hear her again."
5,Suited fine for kids' science fair projects,"Not splitting the atom, but the kids used it for a science fair and seemed to get consistent results. None of them were cracked. Couldn't for sure tell you that they were sterile or not, but they claimed to be and as i said before, we got consistent results."
2,not that functional,"I bought this for my daughter who wanted to learn how to sew. It's ok for this purpose, but don't count on it for great sewing. The speed is very slow, the pedal is cheap plastic and can break easily. The size is easy to handle for quick-fix sewing. The bobbin case is flimsy and comes dislodged easily."
2,Gets some Facts wrong,"Quentin Reynolds has written an interesting book; however he gets some things wrong. First of all he declares Mick Mannock the highest scoring ace for the Allies with 73 Victories. The fact is that the Great French Ace, Rene Fonck, with 75 confirmed victories was the highest scoring Ace. I have no idea how Quentin Reynolds got this simple fact wrong after 25 years of research. Also he is heavaly biased against Ritcofen( Red Baron). He makes it seem like Red Baron is a heartless killer that enjoys killing, which is simply not the case."
3,"Very thin, not as usefull as older versions.","To thin, not durable, needs improvement - should be more like much older versions of this type of stick on paper."
1,More frustrating than motivating,"There isn't a lot of instruction in this video, so unless kids come to it with a working knowledge of kickboxing, they're not going to benefit. The moves aren't explained, which is essential to prevent injury, and Blanks doesn't cue well, so it's difficult to keep up. The nine year old in our house hates this video and finds it frustrating to try and keep up."
1,EXTREME CRASS COMMERCIALISM!!!,"Paris Hilton has a highly commercial and hyped CD out in the marketplace for the exact same reason the dyslexic dufus idiot George W. Bush is our President. Mainly, they are both VERY uninspiring, mediocre, and average people with VERY wealthy and influential parents, whose 'coattails' they rode to fame and fortune. Must be nice to have minimal talent or intelligence in an area, and to have been 'spoon-fed' and coddled all of your life to be able to buy fame, a recording-contract, or even the Presidency! Alas, 'the dumbing-down of America' continues unabated. How much more will we lower our standards here in the U.S.?! WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!"
2,no 30 sec amazon preview.,5 versions of the same song and amazon doesn't have the 30 sec preview of any of them. sooo it's an import ??? where is the international version of the music video??
1,"Stars are blind, I am deaf now.","I can't believe there is an actual fanbase for her and this bottom feeding garbage. First off how did she get famous? second she aint that hot, third who told her she can sing? but now she is all over the radio and TV and having people say this song is so hot, most watched video on the internet and mtv and one of the biggest gainers in radio. Now I just rather put my collection on my Ipod then just to pick this off on my radio with tweens going "" oh my gaw, I luv her, she is my Idol and she is the best singer since hillary Duff"" Get this album or song only if you want your whole town to be drowned by barking and whimpering dogs. Basically dont support this non talent and free us of paris mania."
1,Why Can't Amazon Allow a Zero Star Rating?,"I admit it; I didn't buy this CD. Thank god for that. But unfortunatley I did waste half-an-hour of my life listening to it, thinking that perhaps it might be really, really good. Stranger things have happened in the music industry. But I have to agree with a majority of the other reviewers here. This is truly awful. With all the money spent on producing this thing she should have saved several thousand kids from starvation. Traci Lords' music is WAY better than this, and that's not much of a compliment. Paris ought to just stick to doing what she's good at, which is absolutely nothing."
1,Attention K-Fed shoppers:,"Bland and innocuous ska-pop that is sure to receive heavy rotation in the elevators of a certain European hotel. The vocals are breathy, restrained and probably so heavily processed that dogs will find it more interesting than people. That's unfortunate, mainly because dogs don't spend a lot of money. Of course, the whole point of this audio abortion is brand extension and market penetration--hey, stop laughing, that wansn't a joke! In any event, ""Stars Are Blind"" is less pungent than the Paris Hilton perfume and not nearly as annoying as the Paris Hilton TV show. However, the song and its various remixes are, appropriately enough, pointless.(p.s.: I've also seen the video for the song, and let me tell you, it's not nearly as, um, ""entertaining"" as her last video.)"
1,Someone put this skank to bed,"Triple H: What the Hell is music coming to, Paris Hilton has a record out? Shawn Michaels: Apparently so my man and it s*cks. Triple H: We are not referring to her sucking d*cks or c*cks neither(which she is superb at) but her singing is a joke. Shawn Michaels: This girl got famous for being a heiress, what the Hell is a heiress. Triple H: Who gives a f*ck, I thought she got famous for having affairs with married women's husbands, Puff Daddy and that dog who looks like a rat and would get killed with one kick in the head! Shawn Michaels: No, she got famous for shooting up with Nicole Richie and her l*sb* friends. Triple H: Stars Are Blind is awful and if this is music then may I shoot myself. Shawn Michaels: ME TOO! Triple H and Shawn Michaels says if you are not down with D-X, we got TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells S*CK IT!)"
2,Disappointment,"After hearing Paris' dance songs on XM Radio, I thought this album would be equally as great. Not true. This album was a disappointment, to say the least. The teenie-boppers may love it, but it was quite ""cheezy"". I still like the same two songs as before, but as for the rest of the album?? You be the judge, but I'd wait to buy it used."
1,Going deaf...,"I'm not a kid, I just don't feel like creating an Amazon account. I don't normally review items, but this time I felt compelled to. I would give this single zero stars if I could. It's basically just a bunch of monotonous whispering over a forgettable beat. It's so forgettable, I can't even remember exactly what it sounded like, other than it was really bad. Thank God. By the way, I did not buy this single, nor did I waste my energy downloading it. My friends and I were subjected to listening to it in a movie theater 3 times while we were waiting for a movie to start. We hated it, yet we could not escape it for fear of losing our seats. We're now going deaf. Can we sue Paris for punitive damages?"
1,Stars are blind????,"Since when a song that is catchy means that is good???That's just to show you how bad the taste for music has become. We're basically buying whatever is ""catchy"". OMG !!!Good for Paris that she's doing something with her life but it's sad that that song is considered a #1 hit in the charts.It's not even the rec. industry's problem here, but the consumer that buys the album and request the song in the radio."
1,Dreadful film. Even worse DVD.,"Cheesy adaptation of a pretty good Stephen King novel. While the film is fairly faithful to the book, the directing and acting are so horrible, I thought I was watching an ""A-Team"" rerun.On top of that, this is the worst looking and sounding DVD I have ever experienced. While the DVD restores the film's original widescreen composition, the sound is incredibly muddy and muffled and the visual quality is dull and lifeless.While I wasn't a fan of this film, there is no excuse for a DVD that looks and sounds this bad."
1,"a huge billboard dance hit gets cheap ""radio edit"" treatment","unbelievable. Big remixers, small remixes...track times are:1) Eric Kupper radio edit (3:35)2) Motivo/Antilles club mix (full length 6:28)3) Tony Moran radio edit (4:08)4) Album version (4:42)All 3 remixes are slammin' house/hardhouse. my two favorites, are, naturally, the two radio edits."
3,A good -- but not great -- book on Douglas aircraft,"This hard-bound book, *Douglas Propliners, DC-1-DC-7,* by Arthur Percy, was written almost in the style of Jane's *All The World Aircraft* in an effort to outline the development-progression of the historically important Douglas Aircraft propeller-driven transport aircraft. As such, the book describes with good detail the timeline and development for each aircraft, but these descriptions are somewhat inprecise and grossly lacking in technical detail -- especially regarding the later versions such as the all-important DC-7A-C-series final DAC propliner. As such, I would not recommend this book as a serious reference book on the subject. In contrast, there are books written about the Lockheed Constellation, such as Claude Luisada's superb book, *Queen of the Skies: The Lockheed Constellation,* that are far superior in nearly every regard to this book on Douglas aircraft. It is the level of detail and organization in that book that sets a standard."
5,Great price....,"Okay, I buy these for my dog...lol. He licks his paws and this seems to help lessen his constant licking! Good price and fast delivery!"
1,Is it really that good?,"Well now some call Mark Boals better than Yngwie Malmsteen. It's very interesting. But may I ask a question? Who was Mark Boals before singing for Yngwie? Never heard of him, honestly. He has learnt everything from Yngwie it's clear to see, it's everything copied from Yngwie. Well almost everything. After all it's MacAlpine on guitars and wasn't it him who has tried to copy Malmsteen's work all his life and call his own? Sure it's so. And why did Mark hire just him? There are so many others who could play as well on this album... well the ones not like Yngwie."
5,Very Good Results,"I used this product to repair cracks and holes in two different areas that get moisture, a bathroom ceiling and exterior soffit paneling. Held up well even though I didn't get it primed and painted right away. No shrinkage."
2,More of a hazard than protection.,"Well, the knobs are just an inconvenience, and because you cannot really see through it well, my dad ended up leaving the stove on very low for 2 days before I picked up the pan and realized it had never been turned off.We will not be putting them back on, they aren't very childproof either."
3,Can you say big,"These are a great investment because my little one loves turning knobs, but they are very big when placed on the stove. My stove isn't stainless steel....maybe it was made for a larger model stove. But they do the job just fine."
1,Disappointed,It was not as expected because i thought that it would fit comfortably. It said on the description that it was universal but it is very uncomfortable. Very disappointed.
1,Bad experience with stove knob covers.,The joints melt within a week. It just can't take the heat from the stove or from the oven that is underneath the stove. So the knob cover is hardly usable for a week and then you need to replace it. I am still looking for some reliable cover that would last more than a week and protect the stove knob from my 19 month old really active son.
1,Same problem as below and there is a solution,Save your eight dollars and just take off the knobs for a while. I store them in a locked cabinet and then when I cook I just put them back on then remove them when Im done. Then when your child is old enough just put them back on. I have found this to be the easiest method of protection concerning stoves.PS I also had the same problems as below thats how I came to this idea
3,they're okay,"These covers are fine. They do the job their supposed to do but are extremely annoying (like most child-proof products)! They are hard to open but after a little while, they get easier. I put them on early (my daughter is 3 months old) so they won't be something new to interest my daughter once she's a toddler. To her, they'll be the same old knobs that have always been there."
4,Kittie-proofing the stove,These stove knob covers have given us peace of mind after one of our kitties inadvertently turned the knob on our gas stove. The covers are easy to place over the stove knobs and are made to fit all sizes. They stay on at all times and they're easy to open/close when you need to use the stove. We are definitely satisfied with this product.
2,"Nice Idea, Didn't work!","They didn't work on my mothers oven. I purchased them because she has dementia and keeps trying to cook on the stove top. We removed the knobs, but she somehow finds a way to turn the stove on, so we had to turn the gas off."
3,Works as advertised but not to durable,"This would be my secodn set in less than a year. They certainly work very well and easy to install. I have large gas knobs on My LG oven and they do fit. The biggest complaint is that you have to be VERY gentle about opening and closing them. The little metal pin and plastic hinge assembly are delicate and break easy. I already have one broken. The hinge is plastic and very small. It the plastic was thicker around the pin or somehow made of metal, it would probably be perfect. Even broken, I can at least clip it closed, but when you open it, the top falls off. I haven't found many alternatives for this same product.Three stars for function, but can't give it a five becuase of durability."
3,Stove Knob covers,"great idea, however as a daycare provider, the coloring is so different from the stove, they actually attract the smaller children to them, which is more of a safety issue for myself. Would be a 5 star if they had different color choices based on your own stove."
1,Won't last long...,"These covers, while effective, are very fragile. The plastic around the hinge pin is fragile and breaks easily. 3 of the 5 in my set have broken so far. Time to replace them with something sturdier."
2,Not worth the cost,"With our knobs being on the front of the stove, these covers hung down over the oven door, and either got in the way, or were popped off on a regular basis (or pulled off by our 16 month old). We found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop wasn't in use."
3,A blogging overview,"For beginners, a good overview of the blogging phenomenon and a primer for what you need to get one going. The book is an easy read and should get you up and running before you're done.The author is excited about blogs and brings it to a head with practical steps. It does concentrate on the Blogger family of software, but does mention some of the other options, plus quick overviews on HTML and CSS.Get learning on blogs. With this book and the web on your screen, you'll find ideas on on how to integrate this phenomenon into your business marketing strategy."
2,too wordy,"I've lost interest in the last third of this book. I'm skipping over many pages. I feel that he is too wordy and descriptive. A lot of his writing is not essential to the plot? Just get to the point. He should definitely not be compared to the great Elmore Leonard, I love his books."
2,Not for me,"This really didn't address my concerns regarding menopause, but that is not to say it is not the book for you."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought this for my girlfriend after her smoothie maker broke. I was at first a little skeptical choosing a brand that I was unfamiliar with but so far this crazy little bastard whips up all types beverages. And I'm not talking about your run of the mill boring drink, but a beverage that is smooth like a Sade album on a summer night. I'll keep everyone updated as I keep using it."
2,Bypass St. Clair Entertainment,"The prints don't look restored and the music doesn't match the action on the screen. A friend found me incredible prints from Image. The same thing happened with a Keaton collection. I won't purchase anything from St. Clair, again!"
5,"A quiet, moving story","Although the story takes place in a now extinct city called Bombay, the interactions of the modern Indian family have an eternal quality. Futehally is a writer of the classical tradition: universal, poetic and honest. A great book."
4,Decent replacement part,"Bargain priced that had peaked my attention, and since they are Gabriels, they should hold up well. Upon receiving the struts, inspection revealed made in china, but construction quality appeared good. Installation went without hitch, all the holes were sized right and aligned properly. Ride quality is nice after a couple of weeks after install, smooth and not harsh. I wasn't expecting a sport car style suspension ride, just basic a quality replacement part and that's what I got."
5,Easy Listening!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD! Since I have purchased it, I have listened to it over and over. It's one of those CDs you will never tire of and has been a great addition to my collection.All of the songs are great and are played beautifully by this talented pianist. I look forward to future recordings by Laura Kutscher.I highly recommend this CD!"
1,Please people....,"no ""To Cry You A Song""?1 StarHow do you edit a 40 minute song into 3 minutes?Buy the early CD's... Tull is not a ""singles"" band."
1,a book of quackery,"Dr Weil is a quack and making a lot of money off some very misleading information. If you want to waste your money, you can buy this book. It makes non-evidenced based medical claims as if they were fact and plays on the readers ignorance and desire for a simple cure-all. I work in the medical field and am always shocked by the amount of misinformation that is published. Save your money and don't buy this book."
1,Quackery and Pseudoscientific Shennanigans,"Like Weil's other books, this one is filled with pseudomedical flapdoodle, unprovable claims, unsupported conclusions, and a complete dearth of scientific method. This book is for the desperate, the uneducated, the gullible, and the pollyana population who require no scientific proof of something that sounds good to them. Weil promises health and spontaneous healing to those who already believe outrageous claims without the rigor of proof (also known collectively as ""the stupid""). This book has no basis in scientific medical reality, none of it has been proven clinically (where is Andrew Weil's cirriculum vitae?), and it is all designed to milk cash from the soft-minded, newage (rhymes with sewage) followers that depend on a corpulent quack for advice on eating."
5,Heal Yourself,"Everyone should read this book. Your body is a healing system. This book shows you how to heal yourself from illness and injuries / trauma. Dr. Weil shares with you his experiences traveling the globe in search of true healers of the body and mind. Also what types of food's and supplements we should all be consuming to facilitate healing and better health. Dr. Weil also brings to light the powerfull connection between the mind and the body. Just as Dr. Weil explains the reasons for the onset of an ilness, he also makes it clear what a person needs to do to overcome and reverse the problem. How to turn the healing switch to the on position, so that one may triumph and prevail over his or her illness or traumatic injury. This book teaches us how to be well and how to stay that way. Thank you Dr. Weil. You are the best!!!"
3,partial retraction,"I made a comment about Weil's position on acid/alkaline condition in our bodies. I was wrong. I was refering to Sobel's and Klein's ""Arthritis: What Works"""
3,Wonderfully Informative,This book has a wealth of information that benefit anyone who reads it. It makes a great tool for reasearch.
5,One of the most practical guides to healing ever written.,"As in his past book, NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, Weildispenses wise advise for the experts and laymen alike. SPONTANEOUSHEALING goes in depth to talk about the body as a whole andwhat we can do to maintain good health. From our physical wellbeing to our mind and spirit we learn the secrets to longevity.The testimonials in the beginning of his book will make a believerout of the most skeptical. This book packs a punch and makes onereally stand back and take a long, hard look at thier own health.Everything from removing toxins in your body to ways to transitionyour diet, he tells you. Read it to learn about your bodies owninborne abilities to heal itself."
1,Disappointing,I am a huge Stephen Hunter fan but 'Havana' was a big disappointment. It should have been called 'A Book-Too-Far'.
3,A little dull and predictable,Not Hunter's best work by far. It seemed to be a book with no purpose. The life of Earl Swagger didn't change much due to the actions taken in the book and you feel as though the whole book ought not to have happened at all. Disappointing.
4,Well written and believable for era,I couldn't put it down and will purchase more of this writer. The book gave an accurate and believable depiction of this time span within the country where the story transpires.
3,The law of diminishing returns,"Hunter squeezed another Earl story out of the limited timeline he'd constructed for himself, and this one feels contrived. There is still a good amount of enjoyable stuff. The set piece where Earl senses danger and avoids a trap has the excitement of the better efforts in the series. Some of the minor characters are well-drawn too, such as Roger the ineffectual pretty-boy Harvard man.But I've had enough of the technical gun business, and another annoying aspect for me was the sloppiness in little things. Frankie talks one way when he's first introduced and then another later on. Another minor character starts as a Yale man, then later he's Harvard. And there was an awful lot of misspelling that the editors could/should have caught.I ripped through it on a plane and then left it behind."
2,All of us have the potential to go off the rails now and then,"I love Kaus' blog. Insightful, witty, and thought provoking. He was one of the few who understood the enormous gains to be had by the working poor with the advent of Welfare Reform. I believe he was the only liberal voice who wholeheartedly embrace that legislation.When he touches upon such themes as forcing the poor into the mainstream of society, The End Of Equality is an engaging book. However, when Kaus descends into the quicksand of Great Society thinking (Guaranteed Job, Universal Health Care) the The End Of Equality comes off more as an artifact of the 70's than any forward looking book.Smartly written like his blog. However the book sinks under the weight of poorly thought out ideas."
1,What rubbish!,Want even more extreme policies from the radically egalitarian vermin than we've seen evolve within the US over the past century? Follow the ideas of this turkey and you'll get them! You can have freedom or you can have this kind of enforced utopian egalitiarianism--you can't have both. I'll choose freedom any time.
5,A Must For Michigan Traverlers or Even Those Who Live Here,"This book is incredibly detailed and easy to use. Along with a GPS, there is nothing you cannot find. Whether an occasional traveler or a resident, this is a must to have for God's Country, Michigan's U.P."
4,excellent for those who like to explore,"I spend a lot of time off the beaten path. This map is great for getting there and back. Very useful. This is my third one, as I keep wearing them out."
5,Fantastic!,"The complete Frank Miller Batman, is made up of three books, or two and one issue. The first book is Batman: Year One this is Frank Miller's take on the origin of Batman. This is a good graphic novel that shows how Batman became the crime fighter he is. The second is Santa-Claus Wanted Dead or Alive. This felt like a single issue its not very long and i was a little disseminated with it. The last part of this book is The Dark Knight Returns this is one of if not the best graphic novel i think i ever read. It's the story of Bruce Wayne's return to his alter ego after a ten year hideouts. If you like comics at all its a must read."
1,Cynical distortion,"I feel that Roiphe has capitalized on the celebrity value of Charles Dodgson to sell her story. Anyone who knows anything about the real life of Dodgson is aware that she has distorted this man's life very cruelly. Nabokov wrote a fantastic book on a similar subject to Roiphe but it sold on its own merits not on the celeb value.I didn't think the book was badly written,but there is nothing that makes it special - other than the fact it has hitched a ride on Dodgson's coat tails"
2,Creeped me out!,"While I agree that the writing style was interesting and that the subject was engaging, this book gave me the creeps. I couldn't get past the feeling that I was reading about a man who was one step away from being a pedophile. He was already a stalker; given more opportunity, I could see him moving past obsession into inappropriate action. Now, before somebody says, ""You have a dirty mind,"" let me say that I am the mother of two daughters, and I would never allow a family acquaintance of the opposite sex to have the access to and familiarity with my daughters that Dodgson/Carroll had with Alice. Whether Roiphe's novel was more history or more novel, I don't know; she certainly seems qualified to handle the subject. However, I felt dirty for having even read the book!"
5,Inspiration for Our Times,"An in depth and masterful compilation that demonstrates how people have transformed their sorrow and grief with forgiveness and positive actions. "" Beyond One's Own : Healing Humanity in the Wake of Personal Tragedy"" displays again and again the strength and creativity of humans in crisis. This timely book presents intimate stories we can use as models and inspiration in this time of crisis."
4,sufficiently spooky,"This was a lot of fun to watch. I am terrified & fascinated by the dead walking among us...at any given time, we could be ""being watched"" or studied by those who have passed before us. This really captured the essence of what they all went through, unlike a lot of shows these days that seem kind of canned."
5,Bigger than expected,Case is convenient and holds lots more maps than we thought it would. No more fiddling around trying to find the right map.
1,Will Rogers' Evil Twin: A Movie Buff Who Never Met a Movie He Didn't Hate,"Thank god for the Internet. When I was a film reviewer and reporter for the Daily News in the pre-Internet era, I had to rely on an earlier edition of this reference book, but mercifully, only when I needed a quick date or the name of a cinematographer.I agree with the previous reviewer. Halliwell is the Pauline Kael, Roger Simon of film critics and pundits or Will Rogers' evil clone: He never met a film he didn't hate.One example of his capsule reviews that are so acidulous they can give you an ulcer: Halliwell gives Citizen Kane four stars, then, to use Alexander Pope's phrase, he ""damns it with faint praise"" such as ""A brilliant piece of Hollywood cinema...despite lapses of characterizations [whatever tha means] and gaps in the narrative...""Fortunately, the Internet has made cranks like Halliwell unnecessary for research purposes.Frank Sanello"
4,The Son Also Rises,"Adam Cohen is a fortuante man with a heavy burden on his shoulders. He is fortunate because everyday he can watch himself in the mirror and say to himself ""Your father is Leonard Cohen"". But he has also decided to follow his father's footsteps and that's not easy not now or say a hundred years from now! This freshman album succeeds admirably. The songs are intelligent and some thinking has been put into the lyrics. My wish is that he'd continue to write (and next time around alone)and experience life and write based on his experiences and not what the top 40 Radio wants to hear! I was fortunate to see him perform live and meet him in person. I had the decency not to ask him about his father bacause that was his night. He is one of the sweetest guys I have ever met. I know he will do even better in the coming years."
1,AWFULLLLLLLL,"If you have money to burn or rather to throw away at some rich son of so and so buy it. otherwise leave it alone. Terrible lyrics, pretentious, spoiled and downright mean to his subject matters. Sounds like someone thought him a lesson about life and he never forgot it (SIster song)"
2,For a teen,"Not my favorite, it was kind of boring, and useless information drags on and on. Its not necessarily my favorite book..."
1,Absolute piece of junk,"I was attracted to this unit by its low price, but I soon realized that you get what you pay for. I went through three of these and each one lasted less than 2 weeks.The first one worked fine for about a week, then the signal started dropping. I spoke with Sirius customer service and they told me that where I live (Orange County, just south of Los Angeles) I shouldn't be getting any signal drops and that the unit was most likely defective.I exchanged it for a new one and had it less than 48 hours when the remote control stopped working, so back to the store it went.The third one I got worked fine for about ten days until it stopped playing music. The artist would appear in the screen, but all I would hear is a loud hiss. I messed with the FM Modulator settings, but nothing worked. I returned it to the store for a refund."
3,Same ol' songs recycled for posterity,"This set contains songs common to other compilations from over the years. The only difference is that some of the songs are the mono single versions. In addition, a couple of songs, like THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY, ANGEL OF THE MORNING and SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER are not common to the zillion other compilations out there. There are also some less-known songs by artists, such as THE MAGIC GARDEN by The 5th Dimension and SOMEDAY MAN by The Monkees. All in all... not a bad set, but not a critical add to any record collection. The quality of the recordings themselves is excellent."
1,I am completely disgusted.,"I am completely appalled that this site would sell an item like this. Dog fighting is not a sport. It is an illegal, horrific attack against a beatiful amazing dog. Pitt Bulls are NOT BAD. This are wonderful animals, friends, and family memebers. I am completely disgusted."
5,Fun to read to my 2-year old .. but watch out,"You may want to have some fabric on hand for your young child to ""sew"" after finishing this book. OH, and hide your scissors!!"
3,its ok,As I am in France and cannot order the actual tub stoppers decided to try this. Its is great for keeping shower curtain in at the top but does nothing for water at the bottom of shower curtain. Good idea though.
5,A great improvement over Robert's Rules,"Our Advisory Neighborhood Commission (a minor elective body in the District of Columbia) has been using this book as its parliamentary guide for several years. It's clear, understandable, well organized, and accessible to modern readers. Forget Robert's Rules of Order -- Sturgis provides the same essential rules, but in a manner that doesn't reek of stuffy, archaic 19th century parliaments. Sturgis offers Robert's Rules for the 21st century."
3,So Many Errors!!,"As a previous reviewer mentioned there are errors in the answers to this book. But not just a few, there are over 100. My professor actually handed out a 3 page sheet of corrected errors that were sent to him by the publisher upon request. This is a good tool for learning, but I would recommend waiting for the next edition."
5,A wonderfully skilled summing up,"This is a marvelous book. I don't believe it's a total exaggeration to say that Thomas Frank shares the incisive social perception - and the ability to express it succinctly - of two great writers, George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut. Frank's analysis of American folly and manipulation is a joy to read; although it might not have been so much fun if I'd picked it up when the present administration was still in full swing. One question for the dittoheads; has it occurred to you that the three trillion dollars being spent to pursue an old man in a cave might just possibly, some sunny day, need to be repaid? Duh!"
2,From a Kansan....What's the matter with...Minnesota?,"Mr. Frank asks why we Kansans are intent on voting against our own self interest. Which brings up the question: whatever happened to the ""ask not"" credo of JFK? We Kansan's should not be asking what can I do for my country, according to Mr. Franks and the Democrats we should be saying "" what's in it for me"". As for the idea that we vote against job protection by voting conservative, how's that protection working out in Michigan or Ohio? As employers flee California and other liberal states due to the enormous burden of the welfare state how can Mr Franks possibly make such ludicrous statements? Care to compare unemployment statistics between Kansas and Michigan? KA-BOOMAgain I ask..What's Wrong With Minnesota,Eh? Those good folks have elected a coke-head comedian as a US Senator and this after having elected a professional wrestler as their governor .."
4,It made Kansas interesting,"A supurb piece of modern story telling. Author has a severe liberal bias, so we don't see both sides of the Kansas question....yet it is easy to see his side of how the far-right wing hijacked Kansas politics. There are more than tumbleweeds in his state!"
3,Take from one that is here......,"A fine book that suffers occasionally from over generalization ( e.g., the portrayal of Wichita sounds like Michael Moore's Flint , Michigan) but in the big picture Frank makes a compelling argument that is difficult to refute. The over simplistic pop conservatism that has swept our state, and let's face it the nation as a whole, started off as being just annoying but has now evolved into something a whole lot worse. Frank tackles the reasons why with a clear, concise writing style that makes this book enjoyable and informative on many levels."
2,What's the Matter with Thomas Frank,"This book conclusively demonstrates that liberals wear blinders: Mr. Frank and his ilk simply cannot see that people vote for freedom, thus for limited government. Democrats are the great materialists. They think economic parity, by outcome, should be the paramount value to the ""self-interest"" of middle America. But it is not, and never will be. Opportunity, the child of freedom, is what they value most. Average Americans have no enmity for ""the rich"" because they feel they may be rich too - if that is what they desire. And, by the way, most Americans are not devoted to the simple goal of making as much money as they can. They want to be free, live free, and think freely. Mr. Frank does not acribe any value at all to ""freedom"". Food stamps have value; the freedom to work and earn however much or little food one wants has none.A sorry, misguided, poorly reasoned book that only a liberal elitist could love.R. Richard Livorinedlivorine@comcast.net"
1,Self-loathing,"Hello, My Name Is Thomas Frank. I wrote a book. I'm from Kansas, but I am very ashamed of my background. I feel very insecure when I am around my sophisticated Eastern Establishment idols. So I wrote this book to try to impress my new friends and to disassociate myself from the poor unfortunate souls back home. Goodness knows, I don't want the good people at the New York Times to think that just because I am from Kansas, I am some kind of rural, hick, uneducated religious freak. I mean, if the world must know that I am indeed from Kansas, then perhaps I can somehow redeem myself by bashing my home and the people who live there. That's it - if I can throw in enough stereotypes, skewed statistics, ""colorful characters,"" and mock sympathy, then Maureen Dowd and Howell Raines can see just how much I have overcome from my deprived past. Why, I'll even seem heroic in their eyes! Well, sorry to run, but it's time for me to meet with my French tutor. Au revoir!"
1,Silly snob sniffery,"This book is a perfect example of how liberals just don't ""get it' when it comes to the ""blue state-red state"" divide. Written by someone who steps over the bodies of the victims of the politically correct ""blue state"" every day, and can't recognize how morally bankrupt that world is, this book is perfect for anyone who wants to understand why the Democrats are destined to be the minority party forever. I am sure that Frank would feel at home writing for the New York Times or the Washington Post, but of course like most plains state liberals who don't understand the blue states, he wouldn't survive a week in his alternative utopia like DC, the murder capital of the world. I love this book because it gets so many reviews of people who keep the Democrats driving straight for the cliff. Especially those who supposedly live in ""Benton"" Arkansas, but have never steped a foot out of Manhattan. Just amazing. Step on it!!! Go Howie and Hilly."
5,Lives Up to its Hype,"Just finished reading the paperback version, which includes an afterword about the 2004 election. After everything that was said about this book by the right and the left leading up to the election, I was prepared to be disappointed. Yet the book provided a rare combination of humor, insight, and almost elegant prose that puts Frank in a rare league-- with the likes of Orwell and Mencken. This is really an essential book for those seeking to understand the trends in American politics, and a breezy, funny read to boot."
1,liberals: vote for us cause you're an idiot,"I read this book a little over a year ago in response to a suggestionfrom a left wing blogger. I suppose to be fair, I should go back andreread the book in order to do a better review. But I'll try to ""wingit"" by memory, which may be a real challenge because the book isquite forgetable.Basically the entire premise revolves around the idea that you morons outthere don't know what's good for you. So, the thing to do is to vote forthe left because they know best.Whoever you are, left or right, liberal or conservative- you probablydeserve a little more credit than that. You'll vote for who you think isbest; best for you or for your country. I'll make a deal with liberals:don't call me stupid for voting conservative, and I won't call you stupid.I may think you're pretty stupid, but I'll keep that to myself."
5,Rhythmic Country...,"...or a wonderful blend of soul and country is the way to describe this collection of alternate takes of Elvis recordings from the mid 1970's. The sound quality is usually better than that of the original versions. Some of the versions are much better produced as well as arranged, for instance I Got A Feeling In My Body which totally beats the original version from the Good Times album. I've Got A Thing About You Baby, which is the best song on this album, is here sung charmingly backbeat throughout the first verse. A little bit of soul and a little bit of country presented by Elvis in a rather informal manner + great pictures and recording details cannot result in anything else than five stars."
3,Lionsgate DIGITAL COPY EXPIRED,SIX DISC SET ONE DISK IS NOW A COASTER BECAUSE Lionsgate DIGITAL COPY EXPIRED;AND YOU DO NOT GET THE TIN BOX PICTURED.THE RESTOF THE DVD'S WORK WELL
5,Rambo pack,It was a good gift! The person really enjoyed it. I love how I can pre-order things and get them right when they come out!
2,DOUBLE DIP,"This is bs. I just bought the 'complete' Rambo collection a couple of months ago and it was just parts 1, 2, and 3. Now, after I buy it, of course they decide to release another collectors set including the 4th movie. I should have seen it coming, but why did it take so dang long for them to release it?"
5,Love the Rambo Collection,"Have always been a fan of Rambo movies since I grew up with them. So when I saw this blu-ray collection on sale in Amazon, I just picked it up. I didn't get a chance to view all the movies, but saw part of Rambo II. I felt the clarity wasn't as good as the movies you see nowadays in blu-ray. But I believe its been just re-mastered, you can't expect the same quality. But for the price and being a Rambo fan, I like this purchase and would recommend it."
3,Great movie collection,"This is a great opportunity to get the complete collection of the Rambo movies, so popular during the 80's and the recent production from Stallone of the last Rambo movie. Is a very nice package of 6 cd's with a lot features like interviews with Sly, documentaries, etc. The package I got is not the metal box, guess it might not be available anymore. The bad part about this kit is that it includes a cd with a copy of the last Rambo movie to be downloaded to your itunes or computer windows so you can have it available to watch anywhere or your ipod, unfortunately the code provided to download the movie is already expired so you end up not been able to use the cd, Itunes won't let you download anymore. Thats is the reason I did not give this kit 5 stars. The rest is ok."
4,Weasels Ripped My WEASELS,"When I heard that these new editions of 60 of Frank Zappa's classic albums were coming out, I was both overjoyed and puzzled, but also curious enough to see whether there would be any sonic upgrades from what was out there before from Rykodisc and other sources. The mastering for this album is fantastic, except that this edition omits the extended ""Didja Git Any On Ya""; I wonder why. Also, I want to note to others who really like the jam called ""Orange County Lumber Truck"" that, if you really like that bit of instrumentation by this particular group of Mothers, seek out a copy of a disk called MOTHERS AHEAD OF THEIR TIME which contains the full jam; it cooks! Hopefully, some of these missing pieces will end up on their own compilation or we will indeed see a reissue of the afore-mentioned MOTHERS AHEAD OF THEIR TIME disk!"
5,Entertaining from start to finish!,I really did love this book from start to finish. If I was a writer I could really write down how I felt reading this but I don't think I know the words! Its was beautifully written and the magical element fit in perfect. The recipies were delicious and the caracters were loveable. I love reading but I normally do not review but this time I felt it deserved it. Congrats Literary world as I think we have a new Maeve Binchy on our hands.
5,"A page-turning, good read!!!","This is a really, really good book. It sucked me in and I couldn't stop reading. I highly, highly recomend this book.This book is simply magical. Lovely and mysterious are the three sisters who settle in beautiful Ireland and set up a Middle Eastern cafe in a crazy Irish town in Mayo. The mad Irish caracters and the mysterious Persian women all make up for a amazing and unique read which draws you in by the use of old Persian recipies which begin at the begining of every chapter.(I have made the Lentil soup over and over, its amazing!!!!)I loved the beautiful descriptions of the town and the countryside and it brought me back to my trip to Ireland two years ago. Its DEFINETALY worth getting this book, and devouring it, I m glad I did"
3,"Some interesting recipes, but weak on story and character development.","Mehran's story book put me in mind of _Like Water for Chocolate_, _The Mistress of Spices_, and _Chocolat_, but it never quite delivers. The characters are just caricatures and not well rounded at all. They seem to change instantaneously and it is not quite convincing. The village in Ireland is not fully realized. We are told it is beautiful and green, but never really shown that it is. Also, Mehran's attempts at magical realism just doesn't convince like Esquivel's book does. What Mehran does well is share interesting recipes as she clearly conveys the fear and pain the sisters experienced in Iran before escaping to England and eventually settling in Ireland. A fun read, but not great literature."
1,cliche upon cliche upon cliche,"I read this book as I am interested in Ireland but what I found was a book that used every stereotype, cliched metaphor, and the most purple prose I have ever read. The language is excruciating at best, one wonders if the writer has ever met a thesaurus that she didnt like. I would not recommend this book to anyone other than for some decent recipes that one could find on any Persian Cuisine Website. The book does not even begin to portray what real life in Ireland is like, instead it hopes for the reader's ignorance about rural country life. Overall the novel is completely derivitive of every travel/foodie lit novel but does this without any real depth. One hopes that this young writer learns that content is far more important than flowery language."
2,This Book was Just So-So,I found this a bit tedious; didn't understand the novelty of having the recipes printed thoughout the book. Book just didn't hold my interest.
5,Beautiful!!!,"This was a beautiful book! Well deserving of the praise and bestseller status here in Australia. The cover is amazing and much more inviting then the US cover. The caracters are exactly what I imagined and reminded me a little of ""Ballykissangel"" but the the infusion of the Persian girls and recipies make this book so much more then just about Ireland. Its so well written that your imagination takes you to this place in the West of Ireland and you are drawn into this Village and become part of it. The adding of the Middle Eastern visitors into a not so multi-cultural Ireland makes for some great comedy and drama. I see many more ""Pomegranate Soup's"" in the future as I feel this story has not been told yet and I have just reached Chapter 1. Bravo Ms Mehran!!!!"
1,Boring,I've read a number of books that outline the life of the greatest Marine. Sadly this one seems to have nothing new to add and seems to be nothing more than a boring rehash of the others.
5,Now I know what all the hubbub is about!,"Lee Strobel was born in the Chicagoland area, earned a journalism degree from the University of Missouri and a Master of Studies in Law degree from the Yale Law School, before becoming a journalist who specialized in legal issues. A confirmed atheist, when his wife converted to Christianity, Lee decided to investigate the case for Christ. When all was said and done, he found the evidence so overwhelming that he decided that the evidence demanded a decision, and he became a committed Christian. This is Lee's retelling of his investigation and what he found.I must say, now I know what all the hubbub is about! This is a very interesting book. The author went to a number of highly respected authorities and asked them some very interesting questions about Jesus, and their answers are really enlightening. I really enjoyed all of the time I spent reading this book, and I highly recommend it to everyone!"
5,Lee Strobel's The Case For Christ,Everything Lee Strobel presents is backed up and proven by technology.Is is exciting and very interesting.Lee Strobel's The Case for Christ
5,EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY FILM 5 STARS!!!,"It's an excellent documentary film, definitely a most watch and most have. It will change your life!!!"
5,AN EXCELLENT VIDEO,"This is the best video I've ever seen on the subject. It's clear, concise, awesome!"
1,Repels critical thought.,"Loud, quippy, hurried, soundbite-type journalistic expose where a Chicago Tribune writer converts to Christianity. Strobel draws you along toward his conclusion using testimonies of (exclusively) Christian scholars and it-happened-once-so-why-not -type logic, and quick dismissals of his atheistic objections to the Bible. I couldn't watch this. I had just finished watching the excellent ""From Jesus to Christ"" by PBS. That PBS film interviews the real scholars at the leading edge of New Testament analysis and 1st-century thought: Michael White, Elaine Pagels, Paula Fredricksen. And their narrative asks questions as though they really want answers. If you would rather watch a careless man exuberantly kicking off his atheism like a pair of old slippers, rent this. If you enjoy care, detail, and rigor in your historical analyses, keep looking. Strobel is critically negligent."
1,"A dull, dull, dull follow-up to Revival...","Revival blew me away. I picked it up at a used CD store and fell in love with the CD. I made numerous copies of it (I'm a Deadhead tape trader and turned a LOT of people on to Gillian Welch!). I couldn't wait for this. I tried and tried to like it, but it's just another case of the sophomore curse. It's dull, and unfocused. Let's hope her junior effort will have the spark of Revival."
4,"Not Welch's best, but worthwhile.","""Hell Among the Yearlings"" is no ""Revival"" or ""Time (the Revelator)""; it lacks a clear direction or theme, and it's a little dark for my tastes overall. That said, there are some great songs on this CD; the opening track, ""Caleb Mayer"" gives me the shivers, and ""One Morning"" is simple but grabs your attention and does not let go.I think the more old-time songs, especially those with Gillian on banjo are the strongest -- gorgeous open harmonies and simple melodies.It's a very dark album; I was listening to the CD the other day and realized that track #6, ""Miner's Refrain"" was the lightest so far, and it's pretty rough when the cheeriest song on the first half of an album has the refrain ""I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a deep dark hole.""In short, this isn't a great CD, but there are enough great songs on it to warrant buying it."
5,Great coat rack,"Really pretty, sturdy, and easy to assemble. Plenty of space to hang things and it can hold all our heavy coats."
4,Good for the price,"It's fairly good for the price you pay. Looks good. Not heavy duty, but should serve it's purpose. Easy to assemble."
5,well...it holds coats,"Excellent coat rack, its just what I'd hoped for. It is light weight but well balanced. You can put multiple coats on one side and it will not tip over. There are little adjuster screws on the base so you can make sure all four feet are in solid contact with the floor. It is a good size and look good.Assembly was easy and took only minutes and the only tool was the allen wrench that came with it. There are bolts of different sizes so make sure you look at all of them before you use them.Recommended 5/5!"
5,Awesome!!!,"I love this coat rack. I did extensive research on the Internet to find the best deal out there. This coat rack is the best deal for the money and construction. I literally have scarves, several puffer coats and puffer vests, and sweaters on it and it is stable!"
2,updated : not so good anymore,"this is my previous coomment:The rack is actually looking better than the picture. It has this retro style, which i like. it might not be a very high quality one, but definitely good enough for holding my clothes. The installment needs a bit more care that you have to put each pieces on the right postion and right angel. anyway.. good value for such a product.UPDATE:I ordered 1 for myself, and it works pretty well...so i ordered another 2 for my frd,..none of them works..defective legs..either the hole of the legs are at wrong position..or the screwer would not help put legs on the stick.... very much disappointed... this is piece of LUCK thing..if you get a good set. u r lucky..but i hate to uninstall the parts i already did ..and have to return them..."
3,The Hat Rack,"This product is pretty when it is put together, but do yourself a favor and buy some JB Weld along with it, because the manufactorers glue that is used to hold the beams together does not hold. I used the JB weld to anchor the top piece into the middle, good as new, works fine. Doesnt wobble. Worth the price really, since most coat racks run at about 80 bucks."
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN (OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER)!,"This ""comic"" book is filled from cover to cover with blood, weapons, graphic violent language (""Really dead, I'll be wearing his skin as a shirt kind of dead...""), scary monsterous drawings, people being shot in the head, etc. I ordered this subscription for my 8 year old nephew who waited 10 weeks for his first issue. When it came we were horrified! I canceled the subscription and demanded a full refund. Don't buy this for anyone not in their teens (and think twice before buying it at all). One star is required to post a review, but not worthy of ANY stars."
1,More proof that clowns are evil,"This CD made me want to vomit, over and over again. Hopefully their fame is short-lived or better yet, non-exisistent."
4,A good quick read,"I read this book in its entirety today. It was a good way to pass the afternoon, and as always I enjoy Francine Rivers' books. However, the actual story part of this book is only about 130 pages (there are devotional-type questions in the back that are additional). The Lineage of Grace books are not on the same level (in either quality or length) as Rivers' other books like Redeeming Grace or the Mark of the Lion series. I would definitely recommend reading the Lineage of Grace series, but you might want to just borrow this book from the library and save money, since it will only take a couple hours to read."
2,YAWN,"I read this book for a small group Bible study, but wow-- it is so boring. The other thing that frustrated me is that there are maybe 2 sentences (if that) about Tamar actually in the Bible. The rest is pure speculation. I have no problem with fiction, but I just don't really see the point in crafting this detailed history that is 1) boring, 2) repetitive, and 3) not even in the Bible. I'm hoping the rest of the series isn't as dull."
1,An insult to injury!,"Being a member of the specific society on which this book was written, I feel that I have the ability to write a review on such an incorrect piece of literature. The author of this book portrayed the people of the Creole Cane River community as uncultured and shallow persons. The basic plot of the story is focused on a Young Creole woman who seems to only wish to be ""white"". The author completely ignores the historical correctness of the time and his peice is therefore crucified upon the charge of bias and ignorance on his own part."
2,helpful to some degree,I had a few embarrassing experiences with this tool in my experience living in Sir-Daria & the Farg'ona Valley. The numerous outright typos and mistaken translations proved interesting. Better than learning the language empty handed. Luckily I had good teachers.
2,Occasionally works against itself,"Despite how ugly much of this is, there is an undeniable energy emanating effectively on some of the better orchestrated moments of unhinged dance-punk nastiness."
5,Weird but in a good way,This is some crazy schizo electro/house industrial music featuring a screaming Japanese woman & is only recomended for people who want something completely different from modern day music. This album shouldnt work at all but it does & thats why its brilliant.
3,Book Review,"I like the book, the author has some really good points. It goes on and on a bit too much for my tastes about the ""poisonous pedagogy"". But that being said, he has given me food for thought. Also, to be fair, I have not finished it yet!"
2,Hard Evidence,The story was put together with great detail. And then it ended in a few pages. A surprise but left you hanging. I don't like to invest time reading a lengthy story to have a fast ending. It seems that the author just bailed out. Because of the ending the book was not worth the price I paid.
2,Unprofessional and out-of-date,"This work is divided into 5 parts. The first 4 appear to have been produced around 1990. Their production is a bit corny. But, the facts that they present appear to be accurate and their presentation is only mildly biased. The fourth part contains a segment about ""environmental terrorism,"" which seems a bit biased. The fifth part on the third CD is very recent, very biased, and corny. It covers 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I skimmed through it and at the end, it says, ""Enduring Freedom Productions."" I got this video through my library, but if I had purchased it, I would be pretty upset. To summarize, this video isn't worth purchasing due to the unprofessional and out-of-date production."
1,what? who? where?,Have you ever entered a conversation or meeting half way through and try to figure out what everyone is talking about?This ia exactly what reading this book is like.I gave it one star because it was only 12 bucks.
3,pretty good read,"Good for students of design, it lay outs the basic geometric principles of composition.I would expect a more in depth analysis of geometry and how it has been used in art and design (geodesics, tensegrity etc).a good start!"
2,Biased,I had to read this book for a class I took. The book was intriguing and very informative. Gave a interesting point of view on the topic but did not tell both sides of the story at all. Was extremely biased and seemed to be almost degrading at times.
4,A good performance of a sexy film score,"The producers of the Varese Sarabande Film Classics series should be thanked for giving us a fine recording of John Barry's score for the film ""Body Heat,"" one of the sexiest ever written. This CD by Joel McNeely and the London Symphony Orchestra, though not labeled original sound track, appears to follow the composer's original work. The performance and the sound quality live up to the music, which makes excellent use of a small orchestra, particularly the saxophone. You can find an even sexier re-orchestrated version of the main title on the compact disk ""Moviola,"" a collection of John Barry's film scores conducted by the composer.Michael Michaud, Vienna, Austria"
5,a torchsong elegance that pierces the depths of blues,"I've listened to Nina for many years and she always seems to amaze me with her talent, which actually is a God given skill. Her live performances allow her audience to capture glimpses of her soulful work. She has extraordinary presence that is reflected in her music. On the ""Shades"" album she takes her audience in the the chambers of her heart in songs like Crown and Left. Keep an ear on this one, but hands off because this birds' got to fly!"
5,A CONGLOMERATE OF WONDERFUL SONGS,I purchased this cd not knowing a thing about Nina Storey or ever having heard her music. Once in awhile its nice to try what you may feel is an unknown artist. I was more that pleasantly surprised. The variety of songs on this cd is amazing. I felt that I had went through a full spectrum of music types only to finish the with Shades which left me wanting to play that track over and over again. This cd is so amazing that I will be watching diligently for her next release.
3,"Beautiful and fun, but paint is chipping off!!","My 23-month-old daughter loves this toy-- she hasn't figured out the more difficult square puzzle yet, but loves to stack the circles and octagons. My 6-month-old son loves it too, but has chewed off some of the paint, which surprised me after hearing what great quality Melissa and Doug toys are (this was one of the first 2 M&D; toys I bought). I, like other reviewers, have been a bit frightened of him falling on the 3 prongs and hurting himself. Maybe when he starts walking this toy will get put away for a while.Warning: keep this in a limited space (on a blanket and/or in one room). The pieces could easily be lost if carried into other parts of the house, and this could frustrate children (not to mention OCD parents like myself)."
2,Paint Chips on Melissa & Doug Products,"We love wooden toys and are all about non-toxic products for our baby. Unfortunately, we purchased this product, wiped it down to ensure it was clean, and within days, the paint started to chip. It's chipped all over the item after minimal use for two weeks. I was really disappointed and will probably avoid this brand in the future."
2,Great Designs but Paint Is Chipping!,"I purchased 3 Doug & Melissa toys for my grandson, while he loves the colors and they are easy to handle, every single one of the toys has chipping paint. Poorly painted and since we don't really know what the paint is we no longer allow him to play with these toys. I am surprised that toys clearly intended for rough play, i.e., pounding, grabbing, throwing, don't last more than a few days. Disappointed!"
4,variety stacker,I bought this geometric stacker for my 14 month granddaughter. She can already put the shapes on the stick and will be able to play with this for a few more years to challenge her as she grows. I like the rectange size of how they fit together. I do suggest that parents only let children under age two to play with this toy with adult supervision because of the sticks could be a safety issue.
3,I read a lot of reviews...,"I read a lot of reviews of Melissa and Doug toys and overall the toys I have purchased have been great. This one, however, I finally experienced a problem I read over and over in the reviews regarding the paint. Pieces of this puzzle were stuck together and when pulled apart pulled paint off. I HATE that. Why? And it is a fairly small puzzle but that doesn't bother me like not getting to have a nice new toy for my daughter to destroy. Shipping was very prompt."
4,Great New Orleans Brass!,"What can anyone say about this exuberant example of modern New Orleans brass jazz? New Orleans has been undergoing a resurgence of brass band music for the last fifteen or twenty years, and this little-known group is an under-appreciated part of that movement. Personally, I like this CD as much as a lot of the stuff put out by the more famous Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Its fantastic rendition of the Munsters theme song is such a standout that it's worth the price of the CD all by itself."
5,'Oh boy look at those cavemen go',"Hunky Dory was Bowie's last album as an aspirant, just before he found fame with Ziggy Stardust. It's a fascinating work on many levels that display lyrical depth, vivid imagery, wit and great musical variety, from the music hall pop of Changes through the sixties pop of Oh You Pretty Things to the cinematic lyricism of Life On Mars, a soaring masterpiece. Another of my favorites is Fill Your Heart, a quirky number with his somersaulting voice over lively piano and cheeky sax. Elements of the folkie singer/songwriter are evident on numbers like Song For Bob Dylan while The Supermen reminds me of his later science fiction work likeDiamond Dogs. Bowie also salutesLou Reedand Andy Warhol here, in fact the whole album makes references to his musical influences. Hunky Dory is a bridge between his earlier music hall style and the glamrock that was to follow, and this was just the right mixture of catchy tunes & brilliant lyrics to ensure a timeless classic."
3,good drawings of different types of goldfish....,"but the space requirements were bad advice. Goldfish need a minimum of atleast 15 -20 gal per fish,and koi need atleast 100 gal per fish."
2,Uriah Heep - 'Sonic Origami' (Spitfire) 2 1/2 stars,"An 'okay' 1999 release by Uriah Heep.Not really so bad,just too generic sounding,I thought.All I can say is that hardcore Heep fans would likely get more out of this CD than I did.Decent cuts here to check out are ""I Hear Voices"",""Perfect Little Heart"",the prog-like ""In The Moment""(almost sounds like Asia)and the uptempo ""Everything In Life"".I got to see Uriah Heep play just once,on their 'Different World' tour.Guess they don't tour the states like they once did.I'd still go see them play just to hear the classics.I'm sure I'm not alone on that."
3,not fun,"the book is a little bit boring,I bought the whole series, and my daughter just spent 3 minutes reading it since it sit in the shelf for one year."
4,It was Very Good although many details about others,I think this was a great book although it went on a lot about the thing other people did around such as the life stories of many of the singers and rappers he produced. The only other problem i had was that i did not like the constent telling of the number one hits
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","This was my first Romance book. Victoria Chandler is the perfect dansel in distress, with no solution to her problem. Until the handsome and rich Kane Taggert walked into her life. Kane, become her knight in shinning armor and slays all her dragons in the name of love. This is a book the you can read over and over. You also must read the other books in the Taggert's Sage. Love Francis Ray writing style."
4,Getting close to what I want,"In their third venture into the CD world there has definitely been some improvement. Most of the songs on this CD are the same as their prior Pristine Smut CD, but some have undergone rework. This CD is more pop oriented then either of the Murmur's previous CDs.I was disappointed that this didn't follow the same style as the debut CD, The Murmurs, but certainly happy that they had moved on from the 4 person band of Pristine Smut. It's a good CD, and the Murmurs have learned to perform pop music well, but will probably be a disappointed for fans of the original."
3,Audience Bootleg with Spirit,"Sound quality is poor at the outset, like so many shows. Trench Town Rock and Burnin' and Looting' sound like poor audience bootlegs. The sound system is tuned in by the time we get to No Woman No Cry and Lively Up Yourself. Those two tracks are the highlights in my opinion. The audience is very appreciative and enthusiastic throughout. Still, I would recommend this only to people who can forgive bootleg sound."
2,"Great playlist, bad quality","I am very disappointed in this product. First of all, the music is very high-pitched. Second, Bob does not sound like himself at all. Third, on some of the tracks you can barely hear him singing. We will just have to wait until it is released on the Tuff Gong/Island label. Save your money!"
4,Dont mess up the first time,"Using a grommet when running the power wire through a cars firewall is a must! And these are a very slick, and clean way to acomplish a sometimes tedious and time consuming task. When is came time to do a amplifier install in my Mitsubish Eclipse I wanted to take special care in doing a sound and secure installation. I drilled the hole in the firewall after checking the clearance in the engine compartment and interior. The thing I didint take into account was the part about screwing the two halves of the grommet together, I had no way of getting access to it in the engine compartment. This is the only gripe I have with it, even after drilling another hole in a more accessble area it was still a workout geting it to fit tightly. I give it 4 stars because it works well if installed correctly but I have recomend using a much cheaper tight fitting rubber grommet that can be pushed into place."
5,Thank God for Dr. Ash,"This is a truly terrific book covering the basics of probability theory, but it goes far beyond a mere topical treatment of the subject. I was preparing to take a graduate course required for getting a PhD in statistics, and this book was an excellent way to get a leg up in the course. It is clear to me that a great deal of effort and thought was put into making this an excellent text. Thank you Dr. Ash!"
3,swivel plant hanger,"At 2.07 the price is right (not very heavy construction so don't use a large planter), however shipping and handling for an order of two seemed a bit high at 7.35. Vendor response was VERY fast. Had the product within a few days!"
2,My Review for Windtalkers,Windtakers Didn't Have a Strong script.Like Saving Private Ryan.Alltrough It was Silmiler Storylineset In world war two story About Soldiersand Of course Violence. The Movie I thinkIs more about Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage)Then The Navajo Codetalkers.Like In Ryan' It has A little More FocusOn James Francis Ryan. (Matt deamon)Alltrough Windtalkers Had Violent SceensBut It was Pale Compared to Saving Private Ryan'sIn your Face Nightmarish More Graphic PychologiclyMore Disturbing Then Windtalkers. The camera Just FliesIn Windtalkers But In ryan I'ts Like Somone Had a Hand HealdCamera Looks more Like a domcumenrty.Windtalkers It's More Sentimentel Then RyanSaving Private Ryan is More Blunt RealisticThen WindtalkersI recamend Saving Private Ryan. Then Windtalkers.
1,Top 5 worst movie,"I have watched hundreds of movies, but this was one of the worst I have ever seen. I love WWII movies and can usually stomach even the worst ones, but not this. This movie looked like it was directed by a 12 year old and the acting was horrible. Script was bad. Not worth it. Even the action, people blowing up and getting shot were cheesy. Not worth the time."
4,Excellent movie,"One of the best movies I have seen. Very realistic like and true. Shows a lot of blood but hey, that was how war was like. There was a flaw in the movie though that the movie should have reflected more on how the navajos used their code rather than World War 2 battle scenes. One flaw, but everything else was good."
1,Windtalkers,Disappointing to say the least. This WAS NOT a factual film....this was an insult to the Brave Men who gave their lives and saved thousands. The Navjo Windtalkers were the deciding factor in the Pacific Theater and their Nation should be given a formal apology by this entire nation as well as Nicolas Cage and John Woo. Both have lost a devout fan...how sad! Windtalkers is a disgrace!
2,"Great Story, Good actors........bad directing","I found this particular movie much of the same old genra of most WWII movies. Nick Cage is a fantastic actor and I enjoyed most of the characters. However; the story and most of the scenes were no where near the realism of Private Ryan. As one of your coined "" the private Ryan of the Pacific"" I found incredibly inaccurate. Plus if you pay attention you will notice much of the combat scenes take place in a desert setting. The battle for Saipan actually was more of a jungle setting somewhat like Guam or Okinawa. As usual Hollywood should pay more attention to accuracy then they do. Many in the audience saw this and it certainly hurt the realism and effected the story as well."
2,disappointing,"Low budget movie and it shows. Nicholas Cage's performance is so bad that every time I see him on the screen I just want to look away. It was painful to sit through 2 hours of the movie focusing on him and not the codetalkers (who the movie title suggests to be the main characters). The two codetalkers and the other sergeant (played by Christian Slater) who is supposed to protect one of them are my favorite. Seeing them always puts a smile on my face. To be honest I like everyone but Nicholas Cage's character. Get someone else to play him and I'd have rated this movie 2 stars higher for mentioning the role of the Indians in WWII. If you want to give this series a try, I highly suggest renting it."
2,More cowboys vs Indians movie.,"This movie kind of stinks. Nicolas Cage's character is a marine corp sergent who is in charge of making sure that his Nevajo Indian companion who acts as a code talker doesn't fall into the Japanese hands. This movie supposedly took place during the invasion of Saipan during WWII. The enemies, which are the Japanese Imperial Army soldiers, were basically nameless and faceless. The only purpose they serve was to be shot, just like the Indians in your old typical western movies. The movie doesn't give you the perspective of what the whole war was about. Also, it was a little unrealistic that at the end when the marines were sent to scout a hill that was supposedly heavily bombarded by the American battleships, and yet, you don't see a single shell hole anywhere. It could have been made better."
2,"A good idea, that could have been better... way better","Windtalkers is suppose to be a epic war movie place in saipan island during WWII. Right from the get go the movie starts and lets you know the settings and whats its going to be like for the rest of the war parts. There guns and gear are very accurate, and some of the battle sections are pretty huge. As far as the reality of it all, its horrible, like it was edited for little kids. It doesn't feel like there in a real battle, and the over acting in the movie is heartless, no feeling comes from the actors. Its a very good idea, really badly done."
2,I Walked out,"OK here's what you're thinking going into this movie, John Woo, Nick Cage, Christian Slater, WW2. This is going to be a great flick right? Wrong! As several other reviewers have noted most of what we see is the patented Nick Cage manic depressed looks in various enviroments. Nick depressed with bullets flying, nick depressed in the grave yard, nick depressed in hospital...get the picture? I can't say how it ends up because I walked out after ""Nick depressed with sake after the mission got fouled up"" Thank God AAFES only charges $3.50 a ticket."
3,Workable hardware. not so good software.,I bougth this product to tape things from tv. The software leaves a lot to chance and I don't know how to convert the files.
3,Always searching for forgotten dreams,I loved their two hits. I saw them on Dick Cark. I put this record on and at first everybody likes it. After awhile they want me to play something else. It's a good record to play if you are doing something else.
1,Review,It was a waste of money. It was the wrong version for my Project Management class. I made a mistake buying this book.
2,Not worth the price.,"This thing is a bit flimsy and lightweight; although in a way that's good so you can move it around. Problem is, the existing anchor system will NOT hold it in the ground during strong winds. I was out in the garden at 6 a.m. trying to keep the thing from being torn to shreds in the last Nor'easter. The instructions (which are awful) suggest supplemental anchoring in windy conditions (I live on a mountain side so yes, that fits). But they don't really tell you how to secure it properly. Instead of planting and doing real gardening tomorrow, I'll be working on some kind of way to secure this thing to the ground so it's not a total loss--probably wires, stakes, anchors, etc. What a pain!"
3,This is how I remember George Hamilton,I rented this because I remember seeing it as a child and thinking how handsome George Hamilton was. It's a straight-forward drama in that late 60s style but acting is good and it's fun to see how many actors who were obviously just begining their careers.
5,Power Metal On A More Somber Note,"This is an awesome debut that is not your typical power metal with happy-go-lucky choruses. Although I love power metal in general, it's refreshing to see a band mix different styles to come up with something original.Pianos are one of the main driving forces in their music. Bands like Savatage and Virgin Steele have used piano in their music for years, but unlike them, Soul Takers uses it in a more tragic, romantic style as opposed to a rock opera-ish/theatrical style.This is great music to listen to on a rainy day. If you're looking for something a little more unique and not your average power metal, this band might be right up your alley."
5,"Ahhh, relaxation in the desert","The beautiful red rock scenery alone is enough to make this DVD a winner. Matthew's soothing voice and careful demonstration of the Qi Gong moves makes this even more special.The Fire practice gently eases you into your day; while the Water practice helps you end your day on a relaxing note. There is something magical about circular movements that soothe the body.Matthew provides just enough instruction so you can do the moves correctly, without detracting from the workout.A very highly recommended workout for anyone wanting to experience the magic and the peace of Qi Gong."
5,Great DVD for a home practice,"This is a great DVD, both as an introduction to Qi Gong(for beginners)and as a tool for developing a personal home practice. Both sets are great, and having the choice between the two sets makes this a perfect DVD for whatever your intention for practice is that particular day(whether to energize or relax).The instructions are very clear so you do not have to watch the DVD to follow along, but the scenery is so beautiful that visually the DVD is pleasing as well."
1,Awful!,"This is an awful retelling of the Lady Godiva story. It's mainly a sensual ode to Godiva and her body. Ugh. It's selling on Amazon for pretty cheap, so I won't say don't buy it. But don't spend more than $1 on it!"
4,nice scent,I fell in love with the scent when I purchased a sample/travel size before a trip. Could not find a full size at any local drugstores but was lucky when I found it on Amazon. Getting low on my current bottle so need to order more. I love the scent!
3,"It's helpful, but...","I'm going to take a cruise to Alaska this summer. And when I saw this book in the bookshop, I bought it immediately. It didn't say much about cruise and any helpful tips for the visitors. Also, it didn't describe the places with much details. If you are going to Alaska by YOURSELF (not tour guides) and you would like to do some investigation, then this book is for you."
3,Hitch hikers guide to Alaska.,"If you hitchkiking, backpacking or not using an RV that this is your book. If you using a RV, this book as little value."
3,good for gourmets,"This cookbook is a fun, neat cookbook - especially for those looking for recipes to bake for Jewish holidays. However, this book is certainly not for the amateur baker. Even if you are a chocoholic, like me, don't buy this book as your first cookbook."
2,A Disappointmen,"I am trying to learn quilting techniques for a domestic machine. This book wasn't very helpful. It may be of use to longarm users, but I didn't learn any thing at all."
4,Incubus Lover,"The book came in perfect condition. The cover and pages are beautiful. The book is actually thicker than i expected. I think Brandon put a lot of his heart and soul into it. I'd say if you are a big fan of his and can appreciate music, art, and a creative collage of memoirs and poetry then this book is great for you. It also looks really nice on a bookshelf or coffee table on display."
5,Great Resource,"I love this book. I first learned about it at the library and got tired of trying to use it on someone elses time table. So I bought it so I can read and study it on my own time. I have a fairly large personal library and this is perfect. I love the timelines and tables. The author did a wonderful job in illustrating and laying out the material to be easily understood. After purchasing this copy, I inherited the other books of the series. I love it!"
5,Excellent gothic metal,"First of all, the album cover is gray, so it gets an automatic 3 stars. However, the last two stars are definitely earned. I got this in the mail and have listened to it like 9 times in a row! It's that excellent.Is it hokey? Of course, it's GOTH! Is it gloomy? Absolutely. Is it metal? Definitely.I've been listening to goth music since circa 1995, and I must say I'm not sure why I waited 3 years to purchase this masterpiece of despair. Get it; you will not be sorry!"
4,"Good album, Great KMK album","This is a great album with some fat basslines. ""Play On"" is a standout track."
5,Kottonmouth kings rule,"This album is great, Dloc and Saint Dog are great, this is my favorite band ever, no group could compare to them, Kottonmouth kings rule everything, every song on this album is awesome, i recommend if u like metal, hip hop, punk or if ur a skater definitly buy this album its great, it sux that Saint couldnt be on high society it would of been a better album with him on it. peace out"
4,a world of wonderful animals,"Suprising the children by using vertically opened pages, this book begins with a simple storyline and evolves into listing an impressive range of exotically named animals. Jonas' lifelike watercolour illustrations with clean lines are given an unusual perspective through the playful use of scale and contrast of shapes. Included in the book is a good glossary of the animals named within the story, a pronunciation guide as well as a list of each animal's country of origin. I like the fact that Jonas included extinct animals in her listing which can serve as discussion sparkers on environmental and conservation concerns with children."
2,World War II music collection,"I have a number of similar CDs of this genre of music and the versions of some of the songs on this CD are quite noticeably different. Without picking on specific tracks, I will simply say that certain songs, on other CDs, sound like the singer to whom the vocals are credited, while on this CD the quality of the rendition is such that the claim is dubious. My wife is as favorable to this genre of music as am I, and she quite agrees that the music is not of such a calibre that one would listen to it often, if even more than once at all."
4,great compilation of 40's music.,"i was born in 1961, but like the geeky audiophile that i am, i have eagerly dug into all the decades that have produced recorded music. i always thought that the forties were one of the weaker decades out there when it comes to sonic delights. so why do i love the two volumes of ""songs that got us through wwii"" so much? rhino records has a lot to do with it. as all audiophiles of the cd age now, rhino is one of the best outfits around when it comes to compilations of music. on these 2 wonderful discs from the forties, they have done it again. pure pleasure is to be had here. one drifts back to another time, across decades, to experience the popular songs of another american culture. this is a perfect introduction to that decade for anyone. having heard these two volumes, i can't wait to give the forties another chance. i am being won over, i think. thanks rhino."
3,Good but not top,"Good musicians, good rhythms, phantasy in the melodies and harmonic structure; poor in the lyrics.And although it's well executed, it still mimics Genesis quite a bit."
5,grand and sweeping,"I first heard this album 15 years ago, and find myself returning to my now worn-out cassette again and again. For me it is a perfect introspection album, the music and the lyrics have the power to transport me back in time. While some critics accused the lyricist of pomposity and heavy-handness, I appreciate the way youthful exuberance, anger, and regret all meld into one sweeping epic. I'm excited to finally get my hands on the CD!!!"
3,They Might Be Metallica,"I dig TMBG as much as the next guy, but listening to this album... All of the old songs: Ana Ng, Birdcage, et al -- they're exactly the same except completely different. The meter is lousy, the mixing is bad... Yes, they're live, I can understand, but they're not good examples of what I thought TMBG is. The new stuff is okay, but I reccommend Flood and Factory Showroom (or Then)."
5,this is one of my favorite rl stines ever!,"this is my favorite rl stines ever! i totally loved this book and i couldn't put it down till i was done, and i think that everyone should read this book......it was so unpredicting and u suspect everyone but theres one on true killer...read and find out....you MUST READ this book"
4,Very good,"Being a Richard Laymon book, this is, of course, excellent. To be honest, I would say it is probably not one of his books books, but very enjoyable nonetheless.It is about 2 sisters written alternately from the point of one sister - Penelope - and from the point of the other sister (Melanie)' s boyfriend, Bodie. Both of these characters are very likeable as always with Laymon.I found this book stange as it seems more of a mystery thriller than a horror, the plot being of combination of Penelope being increasingly afraid and paranoid of some obscene phone calls she recieved and Melanie, Bodie and Penelope trying to find out how the girls' father ended up in hospital after a hit-and-run (as Melanie suspects their step-mother and her lover).Slightly different from Laymons usual style but a very good and enjoyable read, with an interesting twist at the end."
1,Tie me up (or I won't sit still for this dog)!,"As your mother used to advise, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."
4,Boy...I oughta get a job working for the MPAA...!,"Pedro Almodovar's done some pretty good stuff--but nothing quite like this. It's, well...UNIQUE. Well, let me tell it like this. No other movie of Almodovar's was rated NC-17--and this one shouldn't have been, either! What was the MPAA thinking when it rated this movie?! According to what I've read...this movie contained two sexually explicit scenes(although one of the two had really nothing to do wiht sex--remember that bathtub scene?)that got the movie rated---yes, X! But when it came to video, they HAD to change the rating for home video--and since NC-17 ws the closest to what it was rated before...well, they marked it NC-17. I have the movie at home, and I watch it when I'm sleepy--the rating, however, is at the very least...QUESTIONABLE."
4,Long road from Albany...,"I have Happy Rhodes's first two tapes carefully stored away in a box; they've only ever been played to make duplicates (which were played to pieces). I bought them mail-order, back when she was just an 18 or 19 year old kid from the Albany (NY) area, trying to get coffee--house and record store gigs. That was 1986 or so.A couple of years ago, I saw her discs on a co-worker's shelf, and said: ""I had no idea she wasn't dead."" Or a housewife somewhere.And while she's more polished and practiced (and less pretentious) than then, the core of her work -- truly fine vocal skills, strong lyricism and good arranging -- are all still there. She had the raw skill (and frankly the looks) to ""make it"" by other means if she'd wanted to; I'm happily surprised to see she's hung on in her own way all these years."
2,Queen of Heart halloween costume,I appreciated the sellers promptness in getting me the order but once I received the item it had completely different accesories ( that were of Dollar store value) than the pictures online and it seemed very obvious the item had been used though this was never noted. I paid over $100 for this crappy costume!!! If you feel you need to deceive ppl in order to make your money then that's on you but I will NEVER buy a costume from the site again!!!
2,What you see is not what you get.,"My pup loves this item.But I was disappointed. The advertising is deceptive. The picture for the product shows two of the kneecaps and it is not shown in the packaging. It says that the items are 3-4 inches each. Farther down the page, it says that the item is 8 oz. It never says how many there are. The advertising implies that there are 2 kneecaps that are 3-4 inches each. Wrong! You get one kneecap for $6.00. Finally, the ad says that it weighs 8 oz, the package says 2.5 oz and the actual weight is 6 oz.I will not buy another Jones product for my animal and will be very cautious when purchasing anything from NYC Pet Supply and fulfilled by Amazon.You can buy Ranch Reward 5 pack for $9.99 ($1.99 ea) here at Amazon. That will be my next purchase."
4,help me!,does any1 know that techno song that they plays in this movie? while he turn on the stero? Email me at babymoo7@hotmail.com
1,unhappy with size,"This is the third pair of Sudini's I have purchased. The two other pair are mules so I purposely ordered this pair in a wide size. But, when they arrived they were too tight. Therefore, I was not happy with the sizing of this Sudini product. And, I had to pay for the shipping both ways when it really wasn't my fault that they weren't sized properly. Needless to say, I can't give this product a good rating."
5,What was I thinking,"I bought this CD back in 1997 for one song only: Staten Island Groove. It's sat on my CD rack for 14yrs. Recently a friend of mine was playing some really funky stuff. He said it was Down to the Bone. I checked it out on iTunes and realized what I've been missing all these years. I downloaded every CD they have. Absolutely incredible stuff. And it makes me mad that I had this CD with all of this funky stuff on it just sitting there all these years.But I'm all caught up. I'm a Down to the Bone junkie and I can't get enough. There is no such thing as sitting still when they guys are playing. To anyone who hasn't listened to this, please give it a chance. If you like old-funk but even funkier, then this is the group for you."
3,Strong elements go nowhere,"Because I admire both Nichols and Feiffer, I wanted to like this film. And there are many things I did like--it's witty dialogue, authentic performances and progressive, adult treatment of sexuality. It's fatal flaw is that the characters aren't well-developed; no person in this film demonstrates any notable emotional trajectory. Ultimately, the creepy awareness sets in that you've been held hostage to an intellectual exercise, built on cliches. Feiffer wrote a stage play based on an obvious premise, and Nichols rendered it cinematic with heavy-handed framing devices. I guess the continued viability of the film hinges on how long people are titillated by the word, ""carnal."""
5,Massive Grooves indeed!!!,"Doug Pinnick abandons his bandmates and flies on his own to deliver one the most thunderous, crunching and catchy cds in my personal catalog! No reason for over analysis here. As Doug has stated, ""Don't dissect it. Just let the music be good to you."" This music will be very good to you! Standouts include ""Shake"", ""Blindeye"", ""Love"", ""Soul"", and actually several others(I just didn't wanna name every song on the cd). Doug is at his best when it's left up to him and only him. No compromise. No outside ideas. Just Doug and his music. It is then that you see what a truly extraordinary musician he is!!"
4,Good workout to stay in shape,"If you want to get in shape or just stay in shape, this is a good video for you. The music is fun to ""dance"" to and Richard keeps you going. I'm 63 and felt this was just right for me. I'm an outdoor walker but felt I needed a cardio workout as well and also on those rainy or snowy days when you are stuck indoors."
5,Richard Simmos: Mega Mix Blast-Off,"Excellent. I love it. Better than I expected. Gives you a real workout, you sweat head to toe. Just what I was looking for."
2,Not one of my favorites...,"This tape is a little fast paced for me, as I need more repetition and better cues to keep up with the exercises. I am holding onto it, because I am hoping that in the future, I will be able to keep up with the pace better. It does have good music and is entertaining, but I like some of his other tapes MUCH better! In fact, this is the only tape in that series of three that I kept. The others in my opinion were much too fast paced."
4,A tender portrait of passion and dignity regained...,"In the mid-'70s, Malle embarked upon a decade-long visit to America where, after 'Pretty Baby,' a sensitive but finally tedious look at child prostitution in 1971 New Orleans, he makes 'Atlantic City', in which an aging small-time mobster sees his romanticized memories of villainy become reality when he acts as father confessor, protector and, finally, lover to a lonely young croupier...Part romantic comedy, part thriller, part fairy-tale, the film is simultaneously mythic and rooted in reality and charms through its wry acknowledgment of human delusions and its tender portrait of passion and dignity regained...""Atlantic City"" received critical acclaim and was nominated for five Oscars (best actor, best actress, best director, best film and best original screenplay), although it won none... It was to be Louis Malle's most successful film..."
1,Depressing and improbable,"This film ought to be on everyones list of the the ten or twenty worst ever made. A depressing film about a bunch of trashy people. The plot is a stretch, why does Sarandon perform her ablutions in front of an open window instead of in the bathroom like the rest of us? Louis Malle the French director is supposed to have quite a reputation. I can't see why after viewing this film. Even in this age of longevity, life is fairly short, so don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Functional but dry and non-comprehensive...,"Lonely Planet guidebooks have been very helpful to me when travelling throughout Asia and Europe in the past. However, I've been reading this particular guidebook on Amsterdam to plan on a vacation, and I feel like it is lacking spirit. Also, as I am a budget traveller, it only lists like three hostels to stay at..and doesnt include much information on them at all. I am somewhat disappointed...Moon Guidebooks are more interesting and comprehensive, it seems..."
2,Uneven acoustics,"As many times as I've listened to this recording I can't get past the acoustics to enjoy the performance. The piano sounds like it was recorded under a horse blanket, dampening any brightness or upper partials. The singer sounds like he is in a phone booth, all brightness with no lower resonance. It is as if the engineers did not want the piano to interfere with the lightness of Bostridge's voice. Unfortunately, the result isolates each performer in the frequency spectrum, making it hard for me unify what I am hearing."
5,This book gives the real truth about what the food industry is doing to our nation!,"If everyone knew the contents of this book, the world would be an entirely different place. People would actually be healthy, less dependent on pharmaceutical drugs, and there would be less incidence of mental illness."
3,What am I eating?,"Nutritionist Carol Simontacchi looks at how the pseudofoods being promoted today - from infant formulas to supposedly health-conscious packaged meals - can physically erode our brains. Examining the relationship of diet to changing levels of chemicals in the brain, this book offers nutritional primers, solutions and recipes to stop the damage.The Crazy Makers provides individuals with the tools needed to confront and turn their backs on American consumer ""foods"". This book is highly recommended for all those interested in obtaining accurate nutritional information on the negative effect such foods have on our mental health, throughout all the stages of life."
2,Can't get a close shave. The clean light comes up after 2 shaves,"I've been using Braun shavers for more than 12 years and this would have been my 4th one, but I am disappointed. As reported by others, it's very hard to get a close shave. After shaving with this one, I can still use the 7+-year-old Braun 5000 series to clean up a lot of beards this new one has missed. On the other, the Clean light come up after 2 shaves regardless whether it really needs a clean or not.It's on its return trip to Braun."
1,JUNK,"Terrible device a waste of your money and time. Broken after one use. First time I used it, I compared it with the oven reading and a digital probe thermometer wired to a receiver outside the oven. The oven and digital thermometer read within 4 degrees of each other. The trutemp 3506 was 50 degrees lower. Decided to give it another chance about a month later. Never got a reading, never moved off 0. Its going in the trash as soon as I finish this review. JUNK"
1,Just plain junk,"What junk this thermometer is. I set my brand new $1000 Kitchenaid gas range for 325 degree, and this junk read 375 degrees. I realize that the temperature should initially over-shoot the set-point, but not by 55 degrees! Also, the needle on the thermometer rubbed against the face causing the needle to chatter its way along. This product is inexpensive and so is its quality. The trash is the only suitable place for it."
3,SQUASH,"I have to say that for fans, ""Sanitarium Blues"" is worth the price of admission alone.But alot of this material has been released many times before & any previous incarnation is far superior than what has been dressed up here. The overall impression is that of a corpse being dressed up in his Sunday best for an open casket funeral."
3,can be had elsewhere,"A not terribly spectacular collection of the Wailers' late 60's sides, which can be found on other, better, collections of their music.The price is fairly attractive, so if you don't want to spend on Wailers' box sets completely covering this perios of their music, then perhaps this cd will make more sense to you.The music is good rude boy and rocksteady style material. Bob does most of the lead singing on here, and the harmonies from Tosh and Wailer (some with Rita Marley, as well..Bunny was in jail for herb possession during some of these recordings)are quite pronounced..Good recordings and well worth having, but again, they can all be had together elsewhere."
4,A baeball education and a good story.,"I am not a baseball fan. I read a review of this book and there was just something that intrigued me about the story. I was prepared to be disappointed but, once I started, I couldn't stop turning the pages to see how all this was going to work out. Of course it was interesting to read Billy's take on the gay part of the story but, I think even with that removed from the picture, this is a moving story of a boy's dream and his struggles to achieve it. It certainly was a most pleasant sojourn into the baseball business and the life of a ballplayer."
2,I was very disappointed in the video!!!,"After reading what others had to say about this video I really thought that I would like it. I was very dissapointed in most of the Phantom of the Opera numbers. I really only enjoyed Music of the Night and Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again. It was like watching music videos not Broadway plays. There wasn't the feeling in most of the songs like you get when you see them performed live. I may be in the minority, but I would not recommend this video."
2,Not what I expected from Walter Matthau,Too many expletives and too much booze for kids viewing. Even as an adult I didn't enjoy it and normally I love everything Matthau does.
1,Burnt Bottoms,"I have used this cookie sheet with and without parchment paper. EACH time it burns the bottoms of cookies and rolls before the tops are done. It also leaves a stain of where the cookies and rolls have been.I think the problem is that while the top is a light, silver color, the underside of this cookie sheet is dark. The dark absorbs the heat more and overcooks the bottoms of cookies and rolls.Terrible for baking, but great for store-bought pot-pies!"
4,Paranoia before the USSR,"This being Dostoevskys second book doesnt really achieve the peak use of language he would later attain. However this is a fascinating book for its paranoid overtures and glimpse into the roots of psychosis. There is much in this book which goes unexplained which I feel lends to the overall feel of the book. After all, how much of neurosis and psychosis is following normal reason? One does come to feel a certain pity for one Yakov Petrovitch Golyadkin. One certainly doesnt want him to be committed. (the apparent but unknown conclusion.) It creates a creepiness and eeriness that makes most modern horror flicks seem amateurish and groping."
2,Doesn't Work,"Not sure what it is, but this just doesn't work at all. Maybe it is Love Hurts with Deeper Well but there is no continuity here at all. What are you trying to do? Too many bad songs with bad arrangements. Calling My Children Home, Where Will I Be, Love Hurts, Green Pastures all stink. Are you kidding me? Another huge missed opportunity. Tulsa Queen, All My Tears and Born to Run are terrific though - just too many bad songs here."
5,"Great Album, But what else would you expect","I usually don't like live albums. They usually sound like they were recorded in a garage, but the vocals and the band sound great. It didn't totally blow me away like Wrecking Ball (which I would have to say is the best album I have ever heard). The songs are not new, but Spyboy puts a new twist and they sound fresh. It is amazing that once an artist is not out to impress the music establishment, the great music they come up with."
4,Emmylou Harris:Spyboy,"I have been a fan of Emmylou for many years. This CD is a great one. Her rock, folk, and country talents show through on this CD. One word sums it up:GREAT!"
4,Emmylou and Spyboy too,"""Spyboy"" is the name of the funky coutry-rock band that backs Emmylou Harris on this fine live album. The sound has much more in common with her recent Daniel Lanois collaboration ""Wrecking Ball"" than it does with her country roots. The musicians on the album are very good (especially crack guitarist Buddy Miller) and the surprise is that she allows them some solos and some instrumental jams. In between those tidbits, her voice is as strong as ever. Twenty-five years ago, this album probably would have found airplay on a mainstream rock radio stations next to songs by Jackson Browne and The Eagles. Fortunately, Emmylou is one artist who continues to insist upon challenging her audience."
1,Flat and noisy,"Sad disappointment this disk was after reading so much hype in the reviews. Advertised as ""Folk Singer of the Year"", this album is not about folk. Harris uses a ""country"" rock band with a compressed range. Her cover of Love Hurts does no justice to the Nazareth original. It just plain sounds awful."
2,Quite awful.,"This movie stars that guy from friends in a movie even more superficial and shallow than its subject. Most of this movie really is just a collection of breasts, without any semblance of a good storyline. The end is worth it, when women who have been ""enhanced"" begin having problems with the implants, but slogging through the soft-core porn to get to it is no easy chore. Maybe Schwimmer was training to be an ""E.R."" doctor in the making of this movie. One of the worst ""Original Movies"" I've ever seen on HBO."
2,Misleading Title,While this guide appears to be excellent for lake fishing it's title as a comprehensive fishing guide is misleading. I ordered this for a planned fly fishing trip so I could find some good rivers. The book has nothing but lakes. If you are interested in lake fishing in BC this is probably a good resource. If you wnat rivers don't bother.
2,Actors posing as musicians.,This record is a manufactured inauthentic contrived piece of garbage. Buy this record if you don't know who you are or what you like to listen to.
5,The Best CD I Have Ever Heard.,"Phantom Planet truely captures what true music should be like. Passionate, inspired, and meaningful. Inspired by the Beatles and other classic bands, Phantom Planet makes this incredible album worth every cent. I urge you to buy this album, you won't regret it. The flowing, catchy songs will be stuck in your head all day."
5,Great Entertainment,"This product consists of one sparkling performance after another, featuring top knotch artists at their best. The selections couldn't be more representative of Webbers' finest work. An outstanding value!"
5,donny osmond was one of the best,donny osmond and glenn close had the best voices i never knew she could sing! but donnys voice really touched me he is one of the greatest singers!
5,Discovering Elaine Page!,"I have always considered ""Memories"" an insipid song (although I am a great fan of both Andrew Lloyd Webber and T.S.Eliot!!). And being allergic to cats, I never paid much attention to the musical when it first came out (negative conditioning). But the first time I saw and heard Elaine Page do ""Memories"" on this DVD, I realized that this was not the ""Memories"" I had so disliked before. Had I been on another planet? How could I have missed out on Elaine Page all these years? I was transfixed by this blonde vision in black (great dress with a cat-like neckline). What expressive eyes, what a gorgeous voice! Her face and voice must've covered a thousand emotions in those few minutes. Was she this good twenty years ago? Or has experience given her that performing edge over younger actors/singers? Man, that girl knows how to work a stage!"
5,The Very Best Selection of Lloyd Webber,This is a beautifully produced DVD which reproduces a 1998 concert in celebration of Lloyd Webber's 50th birth anniversary.The performers are uniformly the best and the selection shows the very wide range of the composer's ability. No lover of LloydWebber's music should be without this DVD.
5,Fabulous Concert,Great...Great songs to enjoy in this DVD. Enjoyed it thoroughly and listen to it over and over again.
3,I caught this on PBS,"It is too bad that they don't list credits, but the PBS version did. For those who are wondering, the young woman who sings the final version of ""Whistle Down the Wind"" is Lottie Mayer. I believe she is also the star of the London play."
5,Andrew Lloyd Webber Review,"Good recognition and praise for an entertaining phenomenon, with many pearls of his creations performed by various great artists, including his ex-wife.Very enjoyable."
4,Excellent!,"I totally loved it! It was beautiful! There were only 2 things that I didn't like in the entire thing. 1. Michael Crawford wasn't there (sniff sniff) 2. Antonio Banderas singing phantom, he sounds good, but that accent is just not right. And, did everyone hear what ALW said, about a continuation of Phantom of the Opera? I'd heard rumors of that but I didn't belive them, I hope it's good."
3,It was okay,This book was okay and i learned some new things. But this book seemed to wiccan instead of just witchcraft. It's worth reading though.
3,witchtwo,"This book did not go into the details of the topics that I purchased it for. I was disapointed because I did not learn about the things which I was searching to know. The book did cover some interesting topics and I did enjoy reading it, yet ifit had given more detailed information it would have been much better. It is a good read for a beginner who has not read much on the subject of witchcraft, but if you have read several books on the subject you will see very little that is new."
5,Not another fluffy bunny beginner book ...,"Finally! An author who writes with an earthy appeal, and helps the reader during their journey of decision-making about the Craft by providing sound, time-tested information in an easy-to-read fashion.This is _the_ book I recommend to most in response to questions about Witchcraft. It is more than a learning tool. It is reminiscent of having a good heart-to-heart discussion with a beloved, trusted friend about matters of great importance."
4,Felt too rushed...,"This is a decent start to a promising trilogy, although this seems to be a very early start in Salvatore's career (his writing improves greatly during 'Streams of Silver'). The main problem in this novel... the battles have too rushed a feeling to them. How does Drizzt seem to escape battle after battle, etc. with hardly any wounds at all?How can any character possibly defeat the enemies with the mass numbers, mass sizes, and even demons so easily? This in all honesty has that feeling that if I read it to my son for a bedtime story, all would be ok.Don't let these questions deter you away from this novel/author though. As said above, the next novel shows real promise... within the first chapter I noticed a difference in the writing style. Pick this up, and begin your journey with Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruenor, and ""Rumblebelly"" (as the halfling is called)"
2,Ack! I restate my review here:,"Remember my review? Sure you do, the one with the Rating system. Remember how people enjoyed it? Well, to say the least, I direly regret that review. This book can be summed up in one word: Abhorrent. This book is not literature. It is nothing. Nihil. Whatever. This book is just ad nauseum for teenagers, nothing more. (Sorry for exercising my Latin)Do not read this book, it is a dreg of a book. (Do not take offense) It is a read for young adults who are familiar with fantasy, yet have a sub-par taste in literature. No, this book is a waste of good trees, art, and ink, that's for sure. I can't advise you enough on reading this book. Please, just don't. Some good Alternatives to Salvatore's juvenile sophomore effort: *Tolkien*, Jordan, Martin, Eddings, or Moorcock."
5,Seriously good boook.,Another R. A. Salvatore classic. Better take a paid vacation 'cause you won't be able to stop reading.
4,A 2step Wonder!,"Mj Cole has outdone himself on this one, I consider this the best single this year! The original version is a 2step garage masterpiece, the Todd Edwards mix is what can I say ""spectacular"" 4/4 Garage, and Attitude well a great start to any Dj Set!"
3,"WE LOVE YOU, BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!","I'm a fan of her first album, especially her songwriting, but Mirror Mirror is more of the same. I just ordered a CD Pages From The Book of Life: Chapter One by Joya, which blows Kelly Price away!!! New sounds, new music, don't do the same thang over and over Kelly!!!"
3,Rear View Mirror,"I had been anxiously awaiting the release of Kelly Price's ""Mirror, Mirror"", the follow up to her debut ""Soul of a Woman"", hoping that the second project from this soulful singer would prove to be a more even effort that her debut.The jury is still out on that.The album begins with an unnecessary interlude of Kelly waking up in the morning (Come on Kelly! We just wanna hear that singing voice!) and continues with typical, radio-friendly R&B fare.The only stand-outs here are ""You Should've Told Me"", ""National Anthem (interlude)"", ""Three Strikes"", ""As We Lay"" and ""Love Sets You Free"". These are the only songs that support Kelly's incredible vocals.On the rest of the album, however, Kelly suffers from what befalls other gifted singers, such as Patti LaBelle- writers and producers who are more concerned with remaining contemporary than with crafting music that is as gifted as the voice singing it."
3,Kelly Price's Mirror Mirror doesn't show her talent,"Mirror Mirror is a good attempt by Kelly, but it does not show the power or the expression of her voice. Instead on this album she continues with the trite formula of the typical R&B record instead of using her voive to make divine expression. Her album focuses on the typical problems of love gone wrong. The song ""You Should've Told Me"" focuses on all the reasons why she couldn't be with one particular man. ""The National Athem"" features R. KElly over the music to the national anthem is Kelly Price and R. Kelly arguing back and forth through lyrical expression. However, the good songs on here are the classic ""As We Lay,"" ""All I want is you,"" ""Love sets you free,"" and ""The lullaby."" This album receives 3 stars for following the path of a typical R&B album with an amazing voice."
4,Price is the Diva,Kelly Price's new album is just another piece of evidence that she is a true diva. She doesn't sing to you ... she tells you in song what she wants you to know. You'll love it. If you need to feel something ... listen to her album and know that she knows how to feel and express those feelings.
1,battery life,"I use 2 AAA batteries in my wrist mounted GPS/pedometer. I have been using Kirkland Batteries from Costco and they last 7-8 days on my 3 mile morning walks. The GPS is older and power hungry. I'm tring these Universal batterys but they only last 2-3 days max. The spent ones tested at still 50% charge but not enough to power the GPS. They are cheap but not worth screwing with, I'll go back to Kirklands."
2,Not up for the long haul...,"You get what you pay for and these batteries are the perfect example. If you are going to use them in an item that doesn't get used often, they might hold up. I however was using them in under cabinet tap lights I bought here on Amazon. I had the lights on for 3 days at about 3 hours per interval. That was all it took to do them in forever. I ended up buying some rechargeable batteries and am happy with the purchase. Save yourself an extra step and a little money by buying right the first time."
1,Not good!,These batteries don't last long. Bought these for a couple of wireless mouse and keyboards I have and they died out fast! Went through half the box in about three weeks. Not satisfied!
1,Awful,Waste of money. Put four of these in an electric ruler I own and they wouldn't even power it up. Wii remotes eat these like tic tacs.
3,Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too Soon,Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too SoonGood shipping time and excellent condition!Relatively corny version! Story line is somewhat in line with the original story but has been tampered with. Makes for a fair kids session ages 5 to 16. Includes two full stories of Capt. America.
2,Mt. Whitney: The Peak and Surrounding Highlands,"While this book's contents and descriptions are adequate for the trails covered it is incomplete in it's scope of the Mt. Whitney region. I returned it as it did not include a reasonable selection of available trails or even primary ones such as the High Sierra Trail or Whitney Portal. Odd, considering that it's title states it's The Hiker's Guide to the High Sierra. I have to travel significant distances to experience the premier hikes in North America and prefer my hiking guides to be more detailed to enable me to make a more informed trail selection decision in an area I've never been to before. This book might serve someone adequately that is already familiar to the region. The backpacking tips and outdoor advice seemed dated."
3,Bitter after taste,"This is a so-so product. Sure, it has a nice chocolate and nuts bouquet, and the first thing your palates will sense is a somewhat lemongrass, berries and wild flowers taste. But beware: the after taste is horrible, it's almost like drinking pee.It does go great with amazon's ""fresh whole rabbit"" though. Add a few crackers, and you've got yourself a dream valentines dinner!Also, I'm very unpleased with amazon. This product does not have any instructions or guides, like what kind of food this item makes a nice pairing, what glasses you should use (I use martini glasses with an olive, or, if I'm feeling frisky, a dill pickle) or at what temperature this is best served (I recommend slightly chilled or lukewarm).Also - come on guys, can't you make a more attractive jug? You have a lesson or two to learn from the tuscan milk guys!"
1,Very Unhappy With Product!!! Not Good!!,"I buy this product on Amazon for use as deer deterrent/wolf attractant but product not work as advertised!Yes, wolf come to my home, attracted by the smell of wolf musk in product, but also comes crazy lady Sarah Palin in helicopter, shooting at me from above like dangerous shooting bird or something! I hate this product!This product is not safe and nobody warned me. I could have been killed, one of my dear children could have been shot, and now I have several wolf and moose carcasses littering my lawn after being shot by this crazy woman attracted by tantalizing wolf musk, who does not even eat her kill or dispose of it.This is not what I wanted Amazon! I want all dead moose and wolf bodies removed from my property and all my money back."
1,Waste of money!,This product does not work at all! I have displayed the Lure in my back yard for a whole week and not one drop of Wolf Urine has appeared. What a ripoff!
3,A tad disappointed.,Today is Valentine's Day and I hoped that a little splash of this would drive my lady wild. But alas... I sleep alone again. Also I keep hearing all this howling outside my bedroom.
5,Our needs are the same!,"This man writes from the heart, a very dark heart soaked in dark love! Beautiful and extremely real with only the raw blood dripping truth to stare at! I am loving this mind so do spend time with him before you are unable to."
4,Great performance - video could be better,"I loved the music selections for this concert. Dudamel is really something to watch - so much enthusiam and passion for the music. Excellent musicians all around.The only issue I noticed was with the video being muddy for wide shots. Close ups look great, but pictures of the audience and the orchestra seem out of focus. Since the concert was shot so recently I expected the video quality to be excellent. Maybe on a large screen TV the video is fine, but on my 12-foot projection screen the sharpness is just missing except for close-ups. Am I hooked on the hi-definition of blu-ray?"
4,Einstein With Only One Equation!,"This is an interesting book about Einstein's life and work. There is only one equation -- guess which one! When the book said you only needed high school algebra to understand the Special Theory of Relativity, I wish it had included those equations. But -- one can find them elsewhere."
2,"Poor Quality, not as pictured in photo","These feeding buckets are not as pictured in the photos, handles are very different and the quality is poor. I returned them all."
4,"good, but not as great as his others","This book, along with Chris's other books, really make the Book of Mormon come alive. While it's not as great and The Feathered Serpent II, it's still a book that I think everyone should read."
1,This book says nothing new--very promotional,there are much better books out there about the business. i got a little tired of reading about point and figure charting. this book is very promotional.
4,somewhat more familiar,"If you are looking for Sister Hazel to expand or develop musically from their last album, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for another feel-good record full of pop hooks, tight harmonies and dualing guitars, then buy Fortress.Sister Hazel does not unveil a grand new musical strategy here. What they do is stick to a formula that produced one of the most catchy, entertaining albums of the 90's.I loved Somewhere More Familiar and Fortress is exactly what I wanted; Somewhere Part II.While some will say that this is a sophmore slump album, give it a chance anyway. Sister Hazel doesn't break any new ground, but like Hootie and Blues Traveler before them, they continue to cultivate a fertile musical plot of land.If you are looking for maturity and diversity of style, buy Todd Snider's ""Happy to Be Here"", if you wish that Somewhere More Familiar was a 2 CD set, buy Fortress.Great album cover, also!"
5,Amazing Moisturizer!,"I purchased this body butter in the Guava. It is very rich so you won't need to slather a lot on like drugstore brands. This leaves your skin feeling velvety soft without a greasy residue like you might expect from a body butter. It is especially hydrating for dry areas like your elbows and knees. The Guava body butter has a pleasant, light scent which reminds me of Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion. Bonus: my BF commented on how good I smelled after I put it on!"
3,The way for beginners to know something about cars aerodynamics,"It is rather interesting especially for someone who is a beginner in the subject. Not so much for those who already bear some competency in the area.These will have learnt aerodynamics applied to airplanes and I was especially interested in learning all the ""twicks"" of underbody / tunnel air routing but I was somehow deceived.Joo Carlos Matoso,Mechanical Engineer (59)"
4,Good Function and Value,"The stand is a strong four stars when you take into account the price. I have three components (DVD, HD-DVR, tuner) and all fit well on the shelves."
2,Cakey,"Very dry feeling, looks cakey. Made me look like I had wrinkles. HOWEVER, good coverage. But not exactly how described"
5,A Colorful Labor of Love!,"I loved this book. It is a colorfully illustrated, thought provoking, tear jerking, meditative, spiritual and eye opening book."
5,Great feel to teeth,"If you have any gum problems, or just like the feeling of teeth that have been thoroughly cleaned, you're going to love this toothbrush. It cleans under the edge of the gums so that all the tartar and other gunk gets taken away. The built-in timer (one signal every 30 seconds for each quarter of your mouth, then another to tell you you've finished two minutes) helps you to make sure you brush your teeth sufficiently. This is just a part of a complete program to ward off gum disease, but it's a critical one."
2,2 years later,"This is a good toothbrush and you won't have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months. While brushing, it works best to progress slowly from tooth to tooth without trying to brush back and forth or in circles. It definitely does better than regular brushing but my checkups are not better than before I started using the brush. The back teeth and the gumline seemed to be missed more but the main surfaces feel smoother. After 2 years, the battery is not holding charge well anymore and the charge indicator LED lights only dimly. Overall, I would say it is worth it but I want to see if there is something better. I am going to buy a Sonicare."
5,Nice Brush,I've used this toothbrush for 9 months now and it's been wicked good. My teeth feel fresh. The toothbrush hasn't broken or shown signs of wear. The battery still charges well. I find that the heads don't wear down as fast as they say. Overall--satisfied.
5,great. puting my dentinst out of business,"I am really happy with this model. I bought it to replace an old Oral-b that now seems really underpowered compared to this. I really think they can produce this item in a different color, like all yellow and sell it as a grout cleaner. Anyways buy it!!!"
1,Sure he can smile while blowing a soprano sax but so?,Insipid. Bland. Awful in every way. Far better to use Amazon.com recommendations and order music by artists such as Monk or Armstrong themselves. Get the real thing. Kenny G is a most feeble facsimile.
1,Desecration,"Kenny G desecrates Gerswin, Armstrong etc. For this he should never be forgiven.Soon to be heard in dentist offices and elevators everywhere."
5,The Best Yet,"This is a phenominal CD. Every track is good, many are superb. The recording quality is the very best.Track 2 is a wonderful rendition of The Look of Love, a song previously unknown to me, but now one of my favorites. But, the Ellington, track 5, is a phenominon! It's absolutely elegant in every way.Perhaps the weakest link is the singing rendition of Girl From Ipanema. Really not so good and it just doesn't stack up to the Getz/Gilberto original. Still, there's some redemption in that there's a nice instrumental version thrown in at the end of the CD.All other Kenny G recordings I've heard pale in comparison to this one."
1,this is quite bad . . .,"I don't know why Kenny G put his horn to actual classics. He is much better suited to play his own compositions, which are shallow, like his playing, and his improvisational skills, which don't exist."
1,Business as usual...,"I first heard this in a restaraunt-- The HORRID ARROGANCE of such a mediocre musician dubbing himself over Louis Armstrong! But it doesn't matter whether he's ""jazz"" or not (even for ""smooth jazz"" he's quite talentless). Even if you take away all the ""categories"" of rock, pop, jazz, country, classical, etc. you are left with a disc of music that is uninspired, with a cookie-cutter ""emotionalism"" that is two-diminsional. For shock value, it might be entertaining to buy this and pair it up with Bolton's ""classics""..."
1,Extremely disgraceful,"Kenny does not seem to want to rest until he's ruined all the classics by Davis, Adderley, Armstrong, Jobim, and Gershwin. What's with that smile man? Do you know about your malicious intent?"
1,Louis Armstrong Is NOT Smiling.,"This CD aims to pay tribute to jazz artists of the past. Unfortunately, when Kenny G does it, it is like Lawrence Welk playing at Woodstock.... and poor Mr Welk has passed on years ago! The biggest abomination is where Kenny G overdubs his sax on Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"". Listening to this song makes me both very sad for Satch and very ill. There are those listeners who rate this CD highly because it is ""relaxing"". As Amazon users, that is their privilege. I personally find this music numbing and always unchallenging. Too bad that we cannot give this CD no stars or ""minus stars"" because this CD is definitely deserving of that distinction."
1,Listen to it vs. Drink coaster,"My wife loves this disc, but I would prefer to use it as a drink coaster rather than have to listen to it."
1,"Should be called ""Classics in the Key of B(oring)""","I'm no jazz afficionado and don't want to argue music theory. I simply know that, unless one can offer new and interesting variations on timeless classics, one should leave well enough alone. This means YOU, Kenny. These tunes sounded very much like grammar school recital pieces to me. ""The Look of Love"" is a haunting and HOT, sultry piece. You played the notes correctly, Ken, but where's the feeling? Ugh. Ugh. But I must give Mr. g bonus points for selecting a terrific assortment of classics; only too bad he had to hack them up."
5,The best yet (outside of his christmas CD),I like it! He shows good breath here. Variety and with good composition. I like the interpretation of some real classics and the mix with the Master Louis is very nice. The smoothness and familiarity of these classical selections mark this one as a true smooth jazz winner.
1,About as appealing as a dentist's drill,I could not decide if the incessant whining or the everlasting droning was worse.
1,tasteless insult to the jazz masters,"Kenny, you have a lot of nerve. I was slightly disappointed when I heard ""What a Wonderful World"". As time went by, I was outraged. You have disrespected the true legends of jazz. I hope you don't consider yourself in the ranks of Charlie Parker and John Coltrane. If I could I'd give negative stars."
5,"Kenny G is really great on this CD, a must for his fans.",I have been a fan of kenny G for sometime now and enjoy all of his CD's. Classics in the key of G is a standout in my collection.
3,I mostly like it.,"While driving to work yesterday I heard Louis Armstrong singing one of my favorite tunes, 'What a Wonderful World.' But something was different, it had a more full bodied sound and a 'sumptuous' arrangement. I loved what I heard, and when the DJ said that it was Kenny G/Armstrong I knew I had to add this cd to my current (500+) collection. I am a 61 year old black man, and I've been to europe during the late 50's when 'cool' jazz was the rage. I love Miles, Coltrane, Monk, Ella, Sarah, Brubeck, Desmond, right on down the line. Kenny G is not in their class, but I think it's unfair to say all these bad things about him. Music is something to make you feel good, and all I know is that when I heard 'What a Wonderful World,' I felt good. Oh, I also loved 'Summertime.'"
5,Believe everything you read about this CD!,"I have seen Chris Smither perform live twice. This is as close to the real experience as you can get. Everything the other reviewers have said is absolutely true. He is a unique performer, the pure exhilaration is incredible. Don't miss this chance to hear a master!"
4,good product,Seems to work ok. no adverse reactions on my mini schnauzers. helped clear up skin irratations and scratching. I would recommend this product to people.
4,Good book,"I read this because I liked the ones Ally Carter has written for teens. It is a fun, easy read. I hope to read the sequel."
4,Very good.,"This is an excellent C++ book either for the beginner or the more advanced programmer. My only problem with this book was the way it introduced the type Class but didn't explain this fundamental concept thoroughly. If you are a novice at object oriented programming this could be confused as the example class ""Gradebook"" quickly becomes populated with member functions. The book spent more time harping on the = versus == stumbling block than the idea of classes!Other than that small problem I found it to be an excellent C++ book."
1,no online access with valid key,"bought this book used, to my surprise the key for the online service was still intact, (not scratched off, so unused)BUT the company that runs the service refuses to accept the key and simply states that it had expired with no further explanation or recourse. When purchasing the book I was not expecting the online service, but certainly also not expecting to get the run around. They look for reasons to not provide service, and do not care. Replies are quick but are preformatted.When I stated that I bought it from Amazon ""We are sorry but Amazon is a third party vendor."" Thats all they said, so I really don't know what that means and they will not clarify."
2,Design Patterns: for Dummies....,"Any time I read books that claim to be the product of epiphanies I get worried. In this case, it's more than justified. I bought this book because of the good reviews here, thinking that it might be a good way to get some of the junior programmers in our group into patterns. Instead, it's ultimately a very shallow revelation delivered in a style that eventually makes me think the writers are slipping back into the same stories over and over again between bouts of polident and fibercon, repeating themselves ad nauseum. There are many good, important points made in the book, unfortunately they are all lifted from other books. The original material here, when you strip away the bowdlerized, readers digest sendup of the gang of four, Meyer, and Alexander, boils down to how the authors solved one silly problem with a legacy CAD app (zzz....zzzz....). Save your money."
5,Read my mind...,"I tend not to heap praise on books because of one thing: I think we buy books that we need at the moment, so it seems that they all have ""something to offer"". That said, I have never read a book like this one that seemed so approachable, and yet very deep at the same time. What I mean by this, is that there are certain gems of wisdom that are very thoroughly explained. This is a book to read twice or more, and keep the red pen handy to write in the margins for epiphany moments. You will have them.The authors are very careful to give credit where it is due, and to explain that they are fellow pilgrims.This is a very PRACTICAL treatment of what can be some way too abstract concepts."
2,Second Edition a disappointment,I like the way this book teaches the bridge pattern. I liked the first edition as a stop-gap. I had anticipated that the second edition would beef the book up in several areas - it didn't. My main problem with this book is that it doesn't stand the test of time. I do not find myself coming back to it.
3,"Decent book, presents good prespective on programming","I picked up this book after reading through the original Design Patterns (GoF). Although they discuss similar topics and this book refers to the GoF book quite frequently, I wouldn't necessarily associate the two with each other despite having similiar book titles. There isn't much code in this book or elaborate examples but it is a nice quick book you can read and is something that can be read easily understood by any level of programmer. In my opinion though you should probably read this book first before you read the GoF book despite this one actually being the one that is supposed to explain the other. To me it felt more like a synopsis and is too brief in many places. More or less it makes a good introduction into design patters but will not be the book that will give you a full understanding of what it really is."
4,Very good Switch Box,"I've read all the good and bad press on this one before I choose to purchase the product. I have found it works very well as long as you use good cables to reduce signal degradation. I have found that Plasma and LCD are more prone to artifacts, while my Mitsubishi projection TV has never had an artifact issue.Unless you really need to have a remote and control more than three HD systems, consider looking at ""Pelican HD System Selector"" or the ""GameStop Universal System Selector"", between 15 and 20 bucks. I have one of those too and have found it to be just as good a appliance.I have had this working for 4 years w/o any issues.NO HDMI ports."
3,"John Kerr, A Dangerous Method","The book reads easily and keeps interest throughout. However, like most American Freud biographies, it ignores the entire critical research effort made by Lacan and his followers, thus remaining within a purely anecdotical (i.e. non-analytical) level. Furthermore, like the movie's final captions, it wholly disregards the hideous collaboration Jung had with the Nazis. The conclusion is that Jung and his followers were extremely succesful in erasing any trace of the former's virulent antisemitic writings and activities (as well as those of the authors he patronized and edited as the President of the German Psychotherapist's Association from 1933 to 1939), consequently preventing the evidence of Nazi ideology in his works to be demonstrated."
2,PLASTIC COLLAPSABLE BARREL,The barrel is very satisfactory but is smaller than I thought.. It will be very easy to store for the winter..
4,Excellent Actors,"Several of the actors in this movie, made the movie. I really like Ray Stevenson. I first picked up on him in the mini series ""Rome"". Since then I have enjoyed his acting in several movies. Several of the other actors have also been seen quit a bit here lately."
2,Outpost,I liked the concept of this movie but execution was more desiring. Thought it was well acted but the thought of phantismal zombies just did not make the cut. Amazon did good job getting movie to me in a timely manner.
4,Outpost Review,This movie was pretty good. A different take on the zombie sort of theme that is unique and interesting.Would definitely watch again.
3,Good Diversion,"This is not a bad movie, much better than a Sci-Fi channel production. It would make a good rental but promises more than it delivers. Similar theme but knock your socks off is ""Deathwatch, it makes Outpost look like a child's bed time story."
4,Low budget with a high gloss finish,"Surprisingly good, is how I would describe this Nazi zombie film. It is impressive for several reasons.* Original screenplay.* Well done cinematography* Better than average acting* Decent musical scoreThis film is very memorable and fun to watch. The gore is not over the top. For a low budget work, it comes off as costing far more. The Nazi zombies have a measurable cruel streak. It makes them very interesting. The characters are not very likable, but this seems to have been done on purpose. The film builds slowly and it is a very long time before we see any zombies. They are introduced in a very creepy fashion, and the originality of the film takes off from this point. All in all, OUTPOST is a very good addition to the Nazi zombie genre."
2,Was not scary. Ray Stevenson was good,"The film was shot well and well played out. But I never thought Nazi Zombies could be kind of boring. How many times can they read ""Mien Kaumf"", it must be tough.It is very well acted, but there is very little story for the actors cling too. I am really mad because someone on the board compared ""Outpost"" to ""Dog Soldiers"" which it sure as heck is not. The direction and action scenes are not even close. This was a film someone looked at the script and said for half a million we can make a horror film and become rich!You really just sit through the film waiting for something to happen. Which is painful. Go see Dog Soldiers and ""Pontypool"" is you want to enjoy a couple of real horror action films."
1,Minus33 thermal top,"These were pricey & I would have expected more for the price I paid. They are warm, they are soft, they are a little thin but no thinner than other brands of mid weight wool thermal underwear. My problem with them is that they have developed what appears to be moth holes in the tops & bottoms. The top was worse than the bottoms; the holes began appearing after the first wash & every time I wash them (hand wash) they have more holes.If they had been manufactured with better quality control & were thicker I would definitely be in love. But alas the hole issue is too much to bear with a product of this price. Too bad but I'll try a different brand next time."
3,100 million bc,"100 million bc is a good movie but again for the asylum it has flaws like the others they made, I will tell you about it right now.The bad things about this movie are that again the computer graphics are lacking so they need to make it better. The acting is good but they need to put more effort in to their acting skills now. Also on the cover it looks like there is a t.rex but it something else that I don't know. And finally the one scene that the soldier was in the water being attacked by a group of creatures, the camera work was really bad because its just one quick scene after another and it was just blurry, so the camera work needs work.The good things about this movie is that it has a good level of violence, gore, action, some suspense, and something that will make everyone feel ok with, a good ending.So keep doing the reviews you feel is right for you."
3,100 Million BC,"Michael Gross doesn't have a large role but he does it well as an inventor of a time machine. The rest the cast are reasonably engaging as they travel back in time and try to avoid being eaten by a T Rex. In a nutshell this is a decent SciFi for a rainy day. If you enjoy low budget SciFi movies like the SciFi channel puts out this is one of the better ones they have released. A decent story and acting concerning time travel, with not to horrible of special effects make it a good rental or even a buy at the current six dollar price.CA Luster"
4,Small but solid hoop,"Easy to assemble with patience and a lot of time; parts were well organized, directions acceptably clear. One person job for most of the project, two help for some of the aligning of parts and dealing with the rim/backboard assembly, although resting it on the ground on the rim worked fine."
5,goodness,"i saw this guys open for dashboard confessional a couple of months ago and thought they were ok. then i heard some samplers from their website nad thought they were good. so i got the cd and now i know theyre amazing. this is really good and original music, if youre in doubt, doubt no more, i once was a wooden boy but now i know."
4,Nice Read,"Book was a nice read. It was relatively short, and so ended quickly (unfortunately). But, because of the length, I have time to read the others in the series now.The book did a great job of bringing to life the story of Rahab, and personalizing it. It was interesting and alive, and relevant. I would definitely recommend reading this."
5,Awesome,This book is great! It really makes you think about the awesomeness of God. The author really makes great speculations as to what could have happened at that particular time in scripture.
4,Picture not as accurate as shown--however great product,I have never found coasters that work better than these. They absorb all sweat into the stone and none pools on top of it or drips onto the table. This is extremely important to me. I have several sets and have also given them away as gifts.The product itself deserves 5 stars. I docked it a start because the picture here shows a border before the pattern starts. What i received was the pattern taking up the whole coaster--the result was that it looked too busy and messy and loud for my tastes. I'm sure there are many others that would prefer the pattern take up the whole coaster.I highly recommend thristystones!!!!
5,Ultra 1000 HDmi Video Cable 4ft.,"We needed a high speed HDmi cable to connect from our cable box to the HDTV, so we could receive all stations in high def. The cable company wanted $50.00 to buy theirs. I went on Amazon & found the same brand for 1/2 the price. It said it was for home theatre hook-up, but it works perfect for whatever you need a high speed HDmi cable for. And the brand, Monster, is the best!"
1,UNHOLY is right--unholy boring,"I can't believe the ""good reviews"". The acting was bad. I'm normally a fan of Adrienne Barbeau.But I wasn't impressed with it. IT BORED ME SILLY and I had to really fight to stay awake."
4,"GREAT costume, but get a size up from what you need!","GREAT costume, but get a size up from what you need! This is a very nice costume, especially for the price!!! But I HIGHLY suggest, you need to get 1-2 sizes larger for comfort!!! The hat is separate, but is a match (same makers)."
5,Very Pretty,"I was very comfortable in this costume. I ordered a medium/large and just barely fit into the top. If they had a large/Xlarge it would have been better, at least on top. I received many compliments....who doesn't appreciate them!! I'm really glad I bought this one."
2,"Beautiful, but runs small!","Just tried this on. Normally, I wear an extra large. Ordering a 1X-2X seemed safe, knowing that most costumes seem to run small. This was way too tight. I'm so disappointed!"
2,lainey,"These are very cute, but I ordered two, and got two different sizes. As I was ordering these for siblings, I could only give one as a gift due to this aspect. I had to, then, come up with an alternate gift, because at the age they are, size and content DO matter!!!!"
2,Deteriorates too fast and is too hard to clean,"The silicone on the spatula works fine (although as some other people have said, it's rather thick). The stainless steel interior material is fine. It does not rust at any rate. But that horrid black rubber handle is pure [deleted]. It not only flakes apart in the dish washer leaving black marks on items near it on the rack--it MELTS if you touch the hot pan with it for too long. I did not spend all this on a spatula only to find I can't wash it in the dishwasher and can't let it rest on the side of the skillet unless its perfectly balanced. I've switched to Zyliss products and am perfectly happy with those."
3,Not for eggs,"This is not your spatula for fried eggs. Its too thick to slide under the egg quickly (I have busted many a egg with this sucker). Works awesome for pancakes, and thin burgers. It is too flexible to hold heavy burgers. It is well made and looks nice, very durable. If you are in the market for a pancake spatula...this be it."
5,bigger than expected,"This product works great, but it is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I didn't read the measurements which was my fault, but I'd suggest doing so because it is quite large."
1,Track #4 is the only worthy bit of the whole CD.,"You may as well skip to track 4 for a rousing theme, which in the movie, was played over the final battle scene. Every other track is a waste, mostly repetitive and dull."
4,The Patriot,"John Williams does it again with his masterful score for The Patriot. While evoking memories of other Williams fare such as Amistad and Jurassic Park, The Patriot is nonetheless fresh. The score relies heavily on the main theme in many of the tracks. Instead of giving different scenes different sounds, Williams has chosen to fall back to the main theme and for The Patriot, this works well. The music does not utilize too much in the way of period music but there are segments of flutes and a beautiful piece played on the violin by Mark O'Connor. Revolutionary War buffs will note that this is not O'Connor's first experience with the Revolutionary War. He scored PBS's Liberty miniseries (also a recommended cd). And for those of you who like to get what you pay for- the cd is almost 73 minutes long. Definitely a must-have for Williams, O'Connor and Patriot fans."
4,Great original music too!,"In addition to the tunes that found their way onto this CD, this film had some great original music, including the absolutely beautiful title piece written by Joe Henry. I'm usually not much on soundtracks that just collections of other people's songs, but this unusual collection combined with the original music make this a gem."
3,disappointed second time around!,"PERFECT size for the baby changing table. We use these over the changing pad and they come very handy when we have little accidents...we just remove it and toss it, instead of having to change and wash the changing pad every single time. Highly recommend this product to all parents out there. Great for changing diapers on the go as well! ***I am changing my review on this product. I had originally given it 5 stars and changed it to 3 because when we ordered them again they sent us a different product. Quality was not the same. The pads are very very thin and of poor quality. Don't understand how we got a great product the first time and such a terrible product the second time. Not buying from this seller again."
2,very thin,I was really disappointed with the thickness of these pads. The plastic backing is very thin and so is the padding. I have bought others at an other sight that were thicker for the same price.
2,"Cliched storyline, completely uninvolving","The World of Eldaterra: The Dragon Conspiracy was interesting - if you are the type of person who enjoys books containing no emotion. The storyline was interesting, if a bit unoriginal; the idea of saving multiple worlds is not new. It did have an interesting little tie-in with an investigator, but even that lacked flavor. I never felt very connected with the characters throughout the course of this book. I didn't particularly care what happened to them and I couldn't empathize with them. The only highlight of this book was the writing, which was on the better side. But all in all, this one's a book to miss."
2,Is that all?,"I love Seinfeld's sense of humor. I loved the TV show. I own all the available DVD's. I'm eager to see him on stage.As for this book, if you've seen the show, you will have heard the jokes. I was hoping that the book would have talked about more about his life. I would have liked to read about his relationship with Mike Costanza, the guy who was to a degree the inspiration for the antics of ""George Costanza"". It would have been nice for Jerry to acknowledge the extent to which Mike Costanza helped Jerry become a success. A good book to read that covers that subject is, ""The Real Seinfeld: As Told by the Real Costanza"" by Mike Costanza and Greg Lawrence. I strongly recommend that book if you want to read about Jerry's rise to fame and glory.Sadly, this book doesn't do more than tell us jokes we've already heard."
1,"Awful, awful, awful.","Anyone who had any doubts about the longevity of Seinfeld's initial schtick will be clearly vindicated by the contents of this book. This awful, awful book. This book is what happens when a limited, one-dimensional gimmick is singlehandedly responsible for the fame of a given celebrity. It is a case study in trendy humor. Barely above the level of ""you ought to be a redneck if.."", Jerry's observational ""didja ever notice.."" formula becomes scathingy obvious af ter the the first ten pages. Not only can you start predicting how every joke will end for the remaining 95% of the book, the experience is even more excruciating when you start hearing his whiny voice in your head. This book is clearly for pop culture historians or Seinfeld fanatics _only_. Just look at what readers who like the book recommend. I mean, in the words of its irritating author, ""Who ARE these People?"""
1,"Seriously, don't waste your money","As a long time fan of Glenn Hughes, I can only imagine how embarrassed he must be that this session is even available to the public at large... Some recordings are just not meant for public consumption and this is a prime example. You would be well advised to instead spend your money on any of the brilliant official Glenn Hughes releases..."
1,"technically what I ordered, but not what I expected","I was unable to find these nails at any brick and mortar store near by where I live, so I looked online. The picture of the box is the same as what I have seen when I bought 3"" nails, but I wanted to 3 1/2"" ones. I read the reviews about the nail packs being broken and figured I'd take my chances on shipping and having some broken. When I got the nails it was in a brown box about 16x16"" I assumed that the smaller Bostitch box was inside. Was I ever wrong.... the nails were in the bottom of this box and filled it about half way. It looked like the were picked up off the floor out of a big pile and thrown in. I have no idea if I got the 4,000 per box as it was just all thrown in, and I'm not about to count all these nails since most of them are broken and single nails. I will not do this again :("
1,Too easy to open!,"Definitely put this out of your child's reach. My daughter's previous daycare had one on their mini-fridge, and all the 1 year olds could open it easily. (It soon broke, after which the teachers replaced it with the same model and the cycle repeated itself.)"
3,"They work well, but break easily",These work well when they are working and are a great deterent that my three year old cannot figure out. The only problem is we go through about one every three weeks because you have to remember to open the latch to close the fridge or eventually the plastic will snap. We keep buying them though because they do the job...
1,Not so great,I used this for about 3 months and at first it worked great and I was so happy to keep my toddler out of the fridge. After some time the stickiness wore off and my toddler pulled open the door. Its very hard to get the glue off the fridge now.
3,not flexible,This product only works for side open refridgerators...it is decieving becaseu it looks like it is flexible and does not work on my side by side electrolux fridge.
4,"Works well, but wears out","I agree with previous reviewers who report that this lock wears out after awhile, and it can fail if a visiting adult decides to force your fridge open. However, it is the best lock we've found. Properly installed, it sticks fine to a standard refrigerator door and it doesn't allow any ""play"" in the door (meaning a toddler cannot open the door partway by yanking at it). My 2 year old cannot open it even though he understands the general mechanism. I like that it automatically locks when the door is shut. I don't have to remind my older son to lock it. We have a standard fridge with one door, so the lock is mounted right at the height where you'd normally reach for the handle. Ours lasted about 12 months and I'm buying a second one."
5,"Great movie for kids, can watch it over and over","If your child is into trucks and big equipment, this is a real winner! Peppy music, lots of action, no dull or boring spots. As with any video for a two year old, be prepared to see it over and over. This one is actually interesting, and you can learn new things for the first dozen or so viewings! You'll see the whole story of garbage day, from early morning coffee, to dumpsters, rolloffs, recycling, and landfills. My child liked the child in the video, the dog bringing recylcing, and all the friendly garbage men waving. I liked the compressor full of waterballoons, the backwards video in the landfill, and the water-melon crushing scene. Something for everyone if you absolutely must watch a half hour about garbage!"
5,The Best Song Ever!,"This is the best cd i ever got. i play it over and over.The BRAVO ALL STARS with there single "" Let the music heal your soul"" are now starting a major fund raising effort 4 the NORDOFF-ROBBINS MUSIC THERAPY FOUNDATION.Its has,TOUCHE, The boyz,The moffatts,scooter,aaron cater,bsb, 'NSync,sqeezer,blumchen,R'n'g,and gil SO BUY IT TODAY! YOU'LL LOVE IT"
5,Great!,"This is great Boat set for kids and even adult too!My kids love this!!Kids use it in the pool, works fine. two kids can sit at the same time, still plenty of room.Great quality,.."
2,What An Incredible Person !!,This video shows the miracles performed by Sai Baba and I am truly impressed. But I am more looking to know his beliefs and teachings which are not covered in detail in this video.
3,"Opteka,X-ray Filter",This lens is not what I expected it requires longer shutter times similar to night time photography. An the image results in alot of noise.
4,A long way from thirsty boots,some people change and some just stay the same..trouble is most of this generation of writers just did themselves in.....thank god eric andersen is around to inform us what happens to talented writers when they stick around for the distance(ok ok dylan is still here but thats another planet)......eric has gotten sad about the world and our foibles and that could be a real drag to listen to but it isnt...he even makes a murder in chinatown groove along.If you didnt recognize the voice you would think this was robbie robertsons first solo album.So if you are expecting the old eric forget it but if you like the sound of change listen in
2,Don't waste your money or time.,"I guess you get what you pay for, very cheap looking. If you're looking for a real latex appliance try mostlydead.com or screamteam.com"
4,Great Book,I am very pleased with the books and have used them for several projects and have more I will do.
4,Amazing Pictures,"I consider this more of a picture book than a story book. It tells the story in a bland, watered-down sort of way that's honestly not so great, but the pictures are fantastic. If you want to read Peter Pan's tale, I recommend the original J.M. Barrie story.I give this book 4 stars for the absolutely amazing photographs. They are high quality, super clear, and tell the story themselves. Bottom line-- If you loved the movie, whether it was the visuals or Jason Isaacs or Jeremy Sumpter, you are going to really love this book. I actually scanned some of the photos and made some really nice framed pictures for (yes, I admit it!) myself and my little cousins who are currently in love with Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan).Another note, this book would be great for young children who are just learning to read. The original book might be a bit tiresome for real young children, but this one gets the story told in a way that's easy for them to read and understand."
4,good for beginners,"My 9 yr old son enjoyed it at first, seems like playing a game. He has now figured out that he is ""learning"" and it isn't as much fun. It does teach typing, but I wish there was more mandatory practice before moving on to the next group of letters and more emphasis on proper posture/sitting/finger position. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it and my son is learning how to type without hunting and pecking."
2,It crashes my computer,"My daughter likes the typing game. However, it does lots of harm to the computer. After installing and running this game, my computer is totally ruined!"
3,"Lacks the magic of the letter factory, but OK","I'd hoped Leap Frog would take on numbers, and unfortunately I was a little disappointed with the result. We own every Leap Frog DVD, and this is the only one that I really don't care for much. The concepts are a lot to fit into the time, so there are problems destined from the start. My kids both count pretty well already, so I'm hopeful that over time the adding and subtracting will sink in. My main annoyance with this is that Quigley's voice is different. The redeeming point is one great song that gets stuck in our heads. Other than the song, it's just OK."
4,Great for pre-schoolers,A very well made DVD the teaches numbers and relationships of numbers to pre-school children. Very easy for the child to follow and maintain the attention span.
2,Don't waste your money,Very dissappointed since the letter factory was so great! It does not keep my 2 year old's attention. I don't see my son learning too much from this video. They go through the numbers too fast.
2,Disappointing,"After buying the great leapfrog ""letter factory"" and ""talking word factory"" this DVD has been a big disappointment. It does not explain anything! Your child will gain no knowledge from seeing this DVD!"
3,Not as Good As the Original,Definitely not as good as the Talking Words Factory. Actually quite annoying and a bit confusing for the younger ages it is intended for.
1,GOES TOO FAST,This DVD covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds! It does not give enough BODY to the addition explanation and is hard to follow. It was a pure waste of money.
3,Didn't work for my son,"My son, who is 2.5 years old, did not like this at all, I could not get him to watch for a minute. However, my daughter who is 6 years old likes to watch it even she already knows all the information in it. I am guessing may be the characters only attract older kids? I am hoping my son will like to watch it one day or my money will go waste. He loves all the Preschool Prep series though, he can watch those over and over and learns quickly from them."
4,works great,"Very easy to use. Stable construction. I've had it for a few years now with no problems. Have used it on two different computers, both Windows based with no problems. Would purchase again."
1,Worked for a Few Months...,My hub stopped working after a few months' use. I agree with 2 of the other reviewers - find a different company to do business with.
1,Really swingin'.....'sept for the singin'!,"This could have been a great c.d.- if only the ""singers"" on it would shut up!!!! The bands are terrific- but the singers are generally awful, and most of the lyrics are super-dumb! What this c.d. needs is a Ray Charles, or SOMEBODY that has some singing talent! But it doesn't, and it is hideous. However, if it were all instrumental, it would have been wonderful. The bands are terrific! What a shame- it coulda been a contenda!"
2,Steven Seagal formula film,"Another blood and guts epic with a young daughter as ""human interest"":I bet Steven Seagal like Elvis Presley wonders where the formulahas gone wrong? He's thicker and older and he playsa gray place between good and bad that he seems able to do better than a good guy. Steven Seagal is the stuff of villains, not heroes.He a a natural bad guy and these roles don't match his""character"": he can't sell hero anymore."
3,Kindle for ipad version was defective,"Seems like a solid resource from all the other reviews, which is why I bought it. The version I purchased was unusable though. Not sure why the kindle version would be defective but 4 out of every 5 pages looked as though they were in Cuneiform."
2,Useless for traffic cases,"The guide is very basic and general, and it is doubtful whether or not it will help you resolve your issues in court. If you have a traffic court case, this guide is especially useless."
4,"There's a lot of helpful information here, but it may be hard to really put into practice","This book has a lot of helpful information about how to prepare and try a court case. But it may be hard for most people to really do that.Practicing law takes practice. Judges can be harsh on amateurs. For those non-lawyers who want to try, this book will help, and help a lot. But don't expect too much."
3,"Nice topic, little text","I really like the idea of this book, however there is very little text to it. Of course you can use it to talk about the topic more with your child. I will look for something with more story to it for my five year old. I think for a three year old this book would be nice. The design is a question of taste. I do not like the bold colors so much, but I knew that before I ordered it."
5,Simply Lovely!,"This lovely book lovingly and simply states the obvious- in our 2012 reality, there are many great ways to be a family- and the key ingredient is love! it is all inclusive and helps the kids to feel part of this world, no matter what their family situation is.it was a huge favorite for my son, who is now 9, and I put a picture of our family on the front cover with the simple words:This is Our Family.this book should be in every kindergarden/first grade class in the country!"
1,The Family Book by Todd Parr,"The counselor at my child's public school read this book to my daughter's 1st grade class. I didn't know my daughter would be exposed to this without my consent! My daughter,age 7, asked me how it was possible for families to have two mommies or two daddies. Apparently this is a book about many diverse types of families. I don't have a problem with that. I do have a problem with the public school system allowing the homosexual marriage agenda to be taught in the classroom. It is disguised under the label ""character education about diversity"" and teaching about ""tolerance'. I think teaching tolerance is wonderful. Tolerance can be taught in public schools without being anti-tolerant of Judeo-Christian views as well. I feel similar to the other reviewer, who explained that she is not ready to get into teaching the ""birds and bees"" to her young child just yet. This book is definanly not appropriate for any child!"
3,"useful, well laid out; but often I don't follow given rule","really helpful in most situations. When I disagree with a given rule for a specific situation, it usually gives enough information for me to select and justify another format."
1,Enough Collections Of Horrible Songs From The 80's,"I know somebody that said that Whitesnakes ""Is This Love"" was the most requested song at his DJ's friends parties.Well,apparently it must have been an American Legion Party for the people over 40's 80's celebration.I listened to it.OH MY GOD! What a bunch of lies!These bands have no talent at all.Rock is really bad.I listened to the ""Monsters Of Metal""-Ac/Dc's album too.Sounded like some guy making up words that make no sense,while his band plays the worst performance of all. ALL 80's MUSIC IS TERRIBLE!!(EXCEPT FOR THE REAL TALENT OF THE RAPPERS N.W.A)"
5,OH MY GOD THIS CD IS RAD!,"FRIGGIN WINGER? IM TALKING BOUT CINDERELLA AND MR BIG ALL ON ONE DISC! I have to dig through the seats of my 84 camaro to find all these tapes at one time! Im stoked...i even started re-growing my mullet! screw shaving your pubes, im talking about Aqua-net and L.A. Gears again man! Rock ON!"
4,Really good.,"I bought this CD a few years ago and it's just a amazingcollection... This is a really good list until you getto the last 4 songs which sound like filler. You have""Is this love"" which is Whitesnakes best song IMO... Youhave ""Can you take me high enough"" which is a really goodsong and I like the solo ALOT. ""Wind of Change"" is one ofThe Scorpions best songs as Carrie is pretty good also.If you enjoy 80's hair bands this album is for you."
2,"A good recording, as far as it goes.",I was a little disappointed to realize that this was a shortened version of the TV offer. Many of the better songs were left off this one.
2,Same old thing!,"Why can't the Drop Kick Murphy's do anything new? Every album sounds the same, and that was cool for a while, but I'm sick and tried of hearing the same old thing over and over again. Don't get me wrong these guys can play a wide range of song styles and in this album they sure as hell do that but it's like they have about four or five styles and that's all we ever see in every album. Blackout is NOTHING new. I swear it's like it's just a b-side track to Sing Loud Sing Proud. If you are a die-hard fan of the Drop Kick Murphy's get this CD, but personally I'm sick of hearing the same old stuff over and over and over and over and over again. For the love of God, EVOLVE!"
4,Doubles as a component video switcher,"As a conventional S-video/composite video and analog audio switcher, the Entech Director AV4.1 may be a bit over-priced.However, this is a high quality stuff with very wide bandwidth. Just how wide is it? Both composite video and analog audio signal path can switch HD component video with very minimal degradation (confirmed by Monster's engineer). Yup, this thing can double as a HD component video switcher (just plug in your Y, Pr, Br into composite video and analog audio pair).As an automatic component video switcher, I think it is an attractive buy."
2,Frustrating,"This recording contains some solid compositions. Unfortunately the delivery of these same tunes is dramatically sold short by the mediocre band employed by Fish and, for the BBC, a poor sound quality. True, there are worst sounding live Fish albums but this one is by no means in the same league as other brilliant BBC live recordings (see VDGG's Maide Vale). Give this one a pass. Turn instead to Fish's Sunsets on Empire or his debut solo recording as others are, at best, a mixed bag...Simon"
2,Disorganized,"When I think of soundtracks, I think of them being unified and flowing, nicely fitting together and working well with the movie or whatever it is used for. This CD, sadly, is not like this. The music does have nice individual pieces, but none of them fit together or the content of the BBC program. ""Aldebaren"" sounds like it would be better on a sci-fi soundtrack, "" I Want Tomorrow"" doesn't fit with the CD or the show, and then songs such as ""Epona"" and ""Fairytale"" didn't fit. There are some nice songs on this album, but ultimately all together, they all sound disorganized and as if Enya didn't know what she wanted to record or what she was recording for."
2,THE CELTS BY ENYA,"IT PLAYS WELL BUT IT CAME WITH THIS CRUSTY CRUD ALL OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE CD. AND ITS DIFFICULT TO GET OFF. WOULD I ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN,, PROBABLY NOT. I THOUGHT IT WAS IN POOR CONDITION EVEN THOUGH IT PLAYS WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE COOKIE DOUGH THAT WONT COME OFF RIGHT IN THE CENTER,"
5,CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD !,"I have written a review of every Enya album I have ,which is nearly all of them,except this one.So here goes!I have only been listening to Enya a little less than a year.Boy what I'V been missing!All that talent in such a small package!This is primarily a soundtrack album so Enya don't sing alot but everything comes togather in such a magical way.When I listen to this CD I can close my eyes and almost see a small celtic village,knights,prince,and princess.Of course the princess looks just like Enya!The music on this album is magical and haunting.Just like Enya's beautiful voice.The fold out sheet that comes with the CD tells where they got the ideas for each song.A lot of Irish mythologies.Makes good reading when listening to the CD."
1,translation mix up on digital copy,"For those of you who may be philosophy majors or have another reason to be particular about the translation you receive be aware that this title as a kindle e-book is not translated by Lewis White Beck as each of the photos of the book suggest. Instead when i ordered it as an e-book I received a Thomas Kingsmill Abbott translation. This to some may not seem important, but translations hold important differences also the Thomas Kingsmill Abbott translation is abundantly available for free rather than paying $5."
2,CLUELESS went in the wrong direction with this one!,"Having the entire collection of CLUELESS Cd's, this one is perhaps the least exciting of all. Not much of a dance cd."
2,Super 80's Camp Cheese,"A big-hair 80's movie with Dean Cameron as a rock-and-roll vampire, Thomas Dolby as the pirate antagonist, Toni Basil as the sex crazed vampire mom...cheesy doesn't begin to cover it so nuff said. Still Toni Basil sure could dance."
5,The unsung heroes of early Gay lib,"It is most unfortunate that only a handful of reviews of this book appear here. The younger generation needs to know about these people. The variety of these people ranges from soup to nuts. I was a friend of Bob Basker, and am disappointed that his work with Miami GAA is barely mentioned. I also met Kameny and Troy Perry, and stood near Ginsberg without speaking to him (all in 1972). Those were heady days. These potted biographies, in many cases, are likely to be the only ones to ever appear on specific persons."
3,Only Fair to Me,"While I expected great things with regard to this book, I was a bit disappointed with the author's seemingly ""love affair"" with what at the time was an enemy of my nation but of course he can write what he likes.He even mentions that his wife was residing in Moscow while he was in 'Nam! Sorry but I served my time in the US Army and darn nearly reenlisted and being the dumb kid that I was, this author's buddies would have killed me.Good content as far as what life was like in Viet Nam but I can't kowtow to these people!"
3,Not what I thought,"First of all, I thought this was the Dermalogica precleanse and not the makeup remover. (My bad.) But being a Dermalogica fan, when the bottle came I thought to give it a try anyway.This eye makeup remover is a disappointment and not suitable for the eye. Imagine slathering gelatinous goo on your eyes, then pouring buckets of tepid water onto them to rinse it off, so that you can open your eyes to see again. Yes, the product does remove eye makeup -- along with your eyesight, if you're not careful. The goo is not eye friendly and stings. The texture is also annoying for eye makeup, although I may be using too much (a dollop of goo will do). Would not recommend to friends, even die-hards of Dermalogica."
1,Why buy it?,"I have worked with CAT-5 cable. I have used it in spool form (like this product) which requires you to attach your own adapters. And I have used it in precut lengths in which the vendor attaches the adapters. If your time is worth more than 25 cents per hour, then I suggest you will be more satisfied with precut lengths. I can hardly imagine an end-use situation in which buying a spool of this stuff would make sense."
3,"Journal will not display correctly, and can't be entered.",It is everything it was adverstised to be but I was unable to access the personal journal feature and this essentially left it worthless for my use except for aesthetic appreciation.
2,Huge Disappointment for a Band that could've been the next Led Zeppelin,"Colossal disappointment. From a huge LedHead who loved Deluxe, Friction Baby, and the ""Circle of Friends"" soundtrack song, I thought this band had tons of potential, but this album was tepid. While every song was phenomenal in the first two albums, only a couple were worthwhile here."
2,"Experimental, but less passion than self-absorption","Fortunately, they've backed away from the maddening grunge expectorations of 'Friction, Baby', but haven't found their way [either] back through the fertile ground of their earlier 'Deluxe', nor ahead to something new, inspired and fun."
5,A beautiful album with lots of emotion,"I have been a fan of Better Than Ezra since 1993, when I was only in third grade! I remember hearing their stuff on the radio, and oh does it bring back memories...their third (or technically fourth for those of you who know about surprise) is such a beautiful album chock full of emotional songs that have become stuck in my head forever...their classic better than ezra rock combined with other melodious and unusual instruments creates just a beautiful sound...the words are poetry, if you can figure them out-that took me a while to think about what they meant. Better Than Ezra is the best music group on earth and they give the most kick butt concerts! Get this CD...it is definetly worth it, it really grew on me. See ya fellow Ezralites!"
1,This book is a joke - written for a child,"I feel it was useless to have so many filler pages with no information on them. It deceives the reader that there is more than there is. IPO should stand for ""I Paid Out"" too much for this book!"
4,EAST COAST DOOM,If your in to the east coast doom scene this is a must have If you want to check out some doom bands you havent heard before all most every thing on there is great.
4,Didn't work on mine.....,"This product didn't scan any of my vehicles unfortunetly. It's didn't specify which vehicles it does even under the obd1. I wish it would of worked with mine but on my friends and family's, it did! I would recommend this one over the craftsman since it's cheaper and does the same thing!"
4,Adorable Christmas Movie,"Kind of like It's a Wondeful Life--loved it. Acting was well done, cast was good and it was just a nice feel good movie."
3,Christmas Carol-ish,"After seeing this movie, I thought immediately to Charles Dickens' Ghost of Christmas Future in ""The Christmas Carol."" That's essentially what Comfort and Joy is about. The main character, Jane, relives a portion of her future, which she finds more pleasant than her current life. Like the Ghost of Christmas Future, the vision allows Jane to see what was wrong with the ""old Jane"" and how to life life in accord with the Christmas spirit.I knocked this movie down a star because, while I love the concept, it does look like a made-for-TV movie. The characters are decent, but sometimes a little too wholesome (particularly Sam, Jane's future husband). There really is never any climax to the movie, and it ends rather abruptly. And the cuts to commercials are a bit too obvious. Some of this is simply the editing job as Lifetime transferred the movie from TV to DVD. Still, it just feels like it reached less than its potential."
4,heart warming,This was a very heart felt movie my girls ages 16 & 20 also loved this movie . It makes you see that grass is not always greener on the other side . That some things you take for granted you would absolutley miss if you didn't have it.
4,Sweet,"I enjoy Nancy McKeon and Dixie Carter, and together they make this great. I never miss it, and now I won't have to"
3,The movie was good but had an unusual ending. The Barn Quilt movement is very interesting and the book is great.,"I'm very interested in quilts and their reappearance in the American Folk Art world. I might not recommend the movie only because it didn't end the way the viewer expected, but I wouldn't mind watching it again. It was well done."
5,Great little grinder,Bought it to grind up spices. Very sharp and efficient! Would recommend for careful cooks only! Those blades are sharp!
5,Great Display (especially for the money).,I'm sure there are better out there but honestly this display (the first LCD I've ever owned) has superb picture quality. And I've found text very readable (often a complaint people have about some displays).About the only negative is that the cable is a bit hard to connect (but seeing how one does that rarely it's something I can deal with).
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"It will stop working after a few months. Read the other bad reviews and you'll see what I mean. YOU WILL JUST WASTE YOUR MONEY. If u don't believe me, go ahead and buy it, and let me know after a few months to a year."
3,Suffers when compared to other models,"I'd probably have been happier with this label printer if I hadn't already tried the other handheld Letra labeler. By comparison, this model is bulkier and less comfortable to hold, harder to use one-handed, and uses more label tape for a given amount of labeling (it prints labels with more unavoidable whitespace on each end). Stay away from this one and get one of the other Letratag printers!"
2,UGH!!!,"This works well but is an ENORMOUS battery power hog! It can deplete a quality set of rechargables in about ten minutes! I was THRILLED that it had AC power adapter capability, but when you add the whopping $24 cost of the adapter to this price tag--it's no longer a value! The labels are fine-- although they give you the useless paper and clear labels with initial purchase. Only the plastic labels last for any length of time. Also, on the larger size print, many of the letters look condensed or ""shmooshed"" into the space--it just looks awful. BUY A BROTHER!! My last label maker was a Brother p-touch and I'm so sorry that I decided to buy this one."
5,label maker is exactly what I wanted,"This label maker is exactly what I wanted. Granted, a friend of mine has it so I was able to test it out before I bought it, but for me, the labels don't fade like I read in some of the reviews and the battery life is surprisingly high for normal household batteries."
1,Dymo LetraTag Plus LT-100H Personal Label Maker,"Window does not light up so you can not tell if it is on or not. Additionally, I don't remember where I bought it or I would return it."
1,"Labels dont stick, ink fades","After only a few weeks, the labels begin to peel. Eventually, the writing fades completely! Especially if you put the label in an area exposed to sunlight, like in a car. Three weeks tops, and you can barely read the text anymore. I am going to try to upload some pics so you can see what I mean. There are ancient label writers out there that make labels that last for YEARS! What a piece of junk. Do NOT buy this label writer! Look elsewhere!!!"
5,New Batteries Fix the Faded Label Issue,"I like this label maker. It is fast, easy to use, portable and has a variety of options for refill labels.I was getting the faded label issue but I tried fresh batteries and the labels look perfect again.It takes four AA batteries. There is also a spot to plug in an AC adapter, but the version I bought at Target did not include the adapter. It's fine without the adapter, as long as you have fresh, or freshly recharged, AA batteries on hand."
3,Not as good as other Dymo products,I purchased this mostly because it is supposed to be able to print clear labels. Unfortunately they come out pale and streaky - almost unreadable. It does work well on white labels.I have had a Dymo postage/label printer for 2 years and it is excellent. Apparently the quality of their product line varies quite a bit.
4,A little heavy but good overall,"I've only used my LetraTag a few times but I can see that it will be very useful in the future. I read all the reviews and even viewed several videos made by satisfied users and one woman talked about how light it is in the hand. Not so, at least in my judgment! I would prefer a colored plastic label to the clear plastic one they provide, and the paper label might be useful when I organize my papers. I wonder if they include these two label choices knowing that customers will have to purchase replacement cartridges to get what they want. In any case, it works easily and efficiently. I'd recommend it. I do wish they'd include the AC adapter though especially since I've learned that the LetraTag burns through batteries."
2,No Talent.....But if you liked Aaron Carter.........,"Okay, I would be impressed with Stevie Brock's vocal ability if I saw him in a middle school talent show, but to have a CD? He's really not that talented. He's young and hot...but is that enough to get you a record deal? If you are 10 and like bubblegum pop such as Aaron Carter and Britney Spears, you might actually love this album. Some of the songs are catchy, and they do have good beats, but Stevie himself isn't fabulous. If you are looking for a truly talented young artist, I have two words for you........Billy Gilman."
5,Stevie is awsome!!!!!!!!,stevie brock is such a good singer. i love his songs. ignore all the bad reviews about stevie because he is really cool. he has great music that makes you want to get up and dance. my favorite song is shut me down. it has a really good beat to it. stevie brock is not another aaron carter. he has his own style. he is so awsome!!!!
5,Super fine but it is inaccessible!,"Everything, that here is written below is absolute nonsense! This kid tries for you and much who has estimated it.Stivies voice is wery fine and rather melodious, fine manner of songs performance. I wish him all successes!P.S. My wishes to moderators of a site:Files exposed here on a site not always can be reproduced successfully. I has bothered constantly look up for software updates!Michael from Hungary"
1,"(sigh)Lol,No No No!!!!!!!","0stars,12years old ,rrriiiggghhhttt.Voice=X,Looks=like a wannabe Aaron Carter.they really ruined it !!!!!OOH MY GOD!! No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no NNNNNNOOOOOOO!!!!!!!BBBBAAAADDDD kid singer whats his name!? Sorry but i didnt like it . P.S Im a BOY!"
3,"Excellent Connectivity, Think Design Could Improve",Yes these are just what is required for top speaker wire to plug into speaker connectors. The only suggestion I offer is that the tubular portion which is crimped onto the wire have some texture rather than smooth. This would improve the grip of the crimp on the wire.
5,Rewarding Purchase,"This mouse was the perfect choice. It was easy to install, and it works perfectly on any surface from great distances. Don't think twice. Buy it."
4,great,"This is a great mouse for the price. It is compact and easy to use. I will buy another one to have for my main computer, as I got these for the laptops for my girls for Christmas. Definately a good purchase."
4,Wonderful work.,"Let me lead in by saying I grant 5 stars only for CDs that transform me or my life. I would give this CD 4 1/2 (if I could).The melodies are stirring. The voice is angelic. The production is deep and incredibly evocative. The songs have real feeling, are infused with real emotion. If you have a soul, this music will reach it. If you don't have a soul, this music will help you find it."
3,"Enya's Watermark, UNextended version, 1988","I was very disappointed that I had ordered a ""shortened"" version of Watermark, the original I guess? I had the tape of Watermark, forever, and am starting to replace them with CD's . What a surprise that there are two versions! I LOVE that last longer version of Storms in Africa! So.....I am disappointed that I got the wrong one! Would have liked to understand that there were two versions of this album; didn't understand that! Love Enya ALWAYS! But not the idea that one song is worth $3 more?! I will send back the 1st one, and get the extended version for the $3 more, but the differences needed to be clearer right up front...""extended version"" included!"
2,BORING,"A great disappointment. I was expecting a better product from this artiste. There is so much much non-directional filler instrumentation that I feel like I bought a CD that was an Enya / New Age elevator music collaboration. You would be better off picking up something by her sister Maire (comparable voice, more creative presentations)."
5,"Wide ranging, yet soothing, collection of songs","I bought this several years ago and never really listened to it. This past year, a 3-day employee retreat that is supposed to instill teamwork used ""Watermark"" as background music to many of the sessions. I found myself entranced, and at times emotional, as we practiced a relaxation technique with the title tune playing in the background. It is now one of my favorite albums, full of rich sounds with a warm essence about it."
5,There is beauty on every track,"This was one of the first CDs I ever bought. It has been almost twenty years and I still have that original CD, albeit a little worn. I do not think that a month has gone by that I have not listened to this album at least once. Every track on this CD has a something to offer. From the haunting ebb and flow of ""River"" to the beautiful longing of ""Na Laetha Gael M'?""ige"" I think every listener will find something on this brilliant album. This is a true modern masterpiece!"
5,"let me sail, let me sail, etc.","Enya is brilliant. I've only got two of her albums, this and SHEPHERD MOONS, but I have to say she's brilliant. This is an amazing CD. Highlights are of course WATERMARK, the bouncy ORINOCO FLOW, the sweet EVENING FALLS, and my favorite, the huanting CURSUM PERFICIO, in which you can hear undead voices chanting the title over and over. Spiffy! It's my opinion that if more people listened to Enya's music more often, there wouldn't be so many wars-that's the power there is in this CD. Buy it!"
3,Pretty Average Casebook,"It's a typical casebook. Some are sprinkled with neat insights, tidbits of knowledge, or commentary that reads a little like a novel. This one really isn't. It is purely functional, on a topic that doesn't lend itself to much excitement."
5,perfect,"The ends took a little longer to get as one set was shipped from another supplier, but they are excellent quality and I will buy more if I get another set of wires that require them."
3,Solid upgrade to your digital system,"80% of the sound quality of Entech's 245.2 at 50% of the cost!This piece lacks the front pannel controls of the 245.2, and is not as sophisticated, most noteably in that it is not 24Bit/96KHz. However, this is still a great upgrade to the sound quality of lower-mid priced CD and DVD players.Do you want deeper, tighter bass from your music? Do you prefer smoother, more detailed highs (cymbals that sound like cymbals and not someone saying ""SSSSS"")? Do you enjoy music where the performers voice sounds like it did when you saw them perform live? If your answers are ""yes,"" then this unit is what you need, and it is inexpensive!If you need even higher resolution with earth-shattering life-like reproduction, then you may opt to pay that additional money (around double) for the Entech 245.2. The value however, clearly lies with the Entech 203.2. Happy listenning!"
2,These shoes are HUGE!!!!,"My daughter wears a size 6.5 so that is what I bought and they are waaaaayyyy to big, they probably won't fit her for another year or more!"
5,we've needed this for years....,"As a counselor who has ran quite a few groups for male perpetrators of violence, I heartily recommend the wisdom of Wexler's course. Noting both the strengths and the weaknesses of the Duluth approach, Wexler integrates Self Psychology, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and other useful approaches into a package that challenges abusive beliefs and attitudes, educates men about the triggers and consequences of violence, and emphasizes the respect, empathy, and ability to confront needed by good DV counselors."
3,Ffoulkes - Armourer and his Craft,"More of a historical record - with reprints of armour related period text, invoices, and treaties. A few photos of armour and period engravings. An interesting read for the armour historian - not a 'how to' or 'techniques' text."
5,Loud and Heavy,If you have any pent up rage listen to this disc and let it all out because there is enough raw talent and energy on this cd to make Metallica sound like Matchbox 20. NO DISRESPECT TO METALLICA. ROCK ON!
4,Down & Dirty,"This is the most erotic book I have ever read and ranks up there with anything dreamed up by the Marquis de Sade. Chloe Thurlow introduces us to actress Greta May. As she makes her way from being an unknown to becoming a star, it is quite possibly a metaphor for what stars have to go through to become stars. From the casting couch to the floor, public nudity, sex on a crowded subway train, sex in the bathrooms of bars, lashing if spanking, a taste of the cane and whip, pulling a pony trap nude in cross-country races with other pony girls (the writer summons up all the excitement of Ben Hur) and (think Gladiator), I almost fell off my chair reading her bare armed (and assed) combat with the randy bill goat. If you like your erotica with plenty of down and dirty erotica, this is for you."
4,Beethoven symphonies with live auditorium.,The music is great but the only thing I do not like is the clapping from the people. It is a good CD for its price.
5,Heavy and durable,"If you like a heavier stick, the Pro-Mark Japanese Shira Kashi White Oak 747's should be on your list. I've tried many others, but keep coming back to the Japanese Oak. Just something about them..."
3,GOOD ACTION,"An older Jean-Claude shows that he still has it. This is the first Van Damme film I have seen in quite some time. I have several in my private collection. Time Cop is my favorite. While some of his signature moves are no more (particularly the Van Damme split), he still can mix it up with the youngsters, who are given a nice amount of face time. We also don't see the Van Damme ""I'm cute and I know it"" look that was in every Van Damme film when he was young and, okay...cute. This is a much more mature Van Damme and I am glad to see that he has moved to roles that fit that maturity. Don't get me wrong, this is not Shakespeare. The plot and story are thin and the acting and dialogue are passable. However, it is a good action flick with enough going on to keep you interested. If you don't expect any more than that, you will not be disappointed."
4,Great read,"It may seem as though the ending is cut short, but if you think about it, it's as though it was meant to be. As if it is suppose to give of a sence that he shouldn't dwell on the past anymore.And that bit near the end when he drives off to vegas, well it wasn't annoying. It was kind of exciting that he might run off again and start yet another life. And it continued with the great imagery throughout the book.It didn't blab on about the things that didn't need blabbing on about. Some descriptions were kept tamed and at other times it was well written. I definitely did not expect some turns this story took. But it was exciting and I always wanted to read on.Great book."
3,Good start but Kennedy gets ridiculous on us.,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book and liked the protagonist(Ben Bradford) but the story started losing it's great strength in the second half. I could come up with so many more stable endings! Why does the author think he has to shock the readers using contrived story lines? Also, I noticed an enormous miscalculation on the author's part... The few days of Ben's New Croydon cover up (right after Gary's death) take place over Halloween. All of us suburban USAers know how huge an event for kids Halloween is. Kennedy completely ignores the mention of the costume/candy loving ceremony and forgets that in reality the little Connecticut suburbia would have been crawling with brats, (and their yuppie parents) ringing Ben and Gary's doorbell all evening!!! Kennedy has been in England too long."
5,Contemporary thriller writing at its best!,"Gripping, well-paced, great dialogue & style. One of the best (perhaps the best) mainstream thrillers I have ever read. Maybe not grade A 'literature', but so what? This tale says more about human relationships, moral choices, values and loss than any dozen pretentious 'serious' novels. If I could afford it, I would buy copies of this terrific tale and give them away so that others could enjoy it as much as I did, but I can't, so you'll have to make do with this recommendation! Honest, it is THAT GOOD! Do yourself a favour: get out and buy a copy of this now. You won't regret it!"
3,"Creepy, in the best and worst sense","I poured through this book in a weekend and feltguilty that I had enjoyed it so much. The writingis quite sharp, and in the book's first half Mr.Kennedy did an admirable job developing Ben'sspiritual and emotional drift. But then thecraziness sets in. The mechanics of the plot growmore and more absurd, and, as other reviewershave noted, the luck the protagonist enjoys is toomuch to accept. The ending is probably the onlyway Mr. Kennedy could write himself out of thecorners he had painted, but it mocks the moralityplay he established so well in those first 150pages. Our hero not only kills, but he dismembersthe body in the goriest way possible, and we'reasked to gloss over that. In the end, it's a fastbut shallow excercise in style."
3,Shallow treatment of intriguing premise...,"If you're going to write a story about the most serious moral dilemma a person can face, you ought to have done some critical thinking about it.Douglas Kennedy, in what presents itself as a plausible and compelling situation (a murder of passion), supplies us with a main character who is utterly one-note when it comes to any reflection of his crime. All of Ben Bradford 's actions are fear-of-punishment-driven only. That coupled with his relentless cynicism regarding all things metropolitan and/or thirty-something, makes for a character who is has little appeal; who, because we're alone with him much of the time, becomes tiresome very quickly.Douglas Kennedy , like Grisham is a competent storyteller, but unlike Grisham, he has not yet explored the personal depth of his subject matter.Bar"
4,"Fast-paced, unique - a real nail-biter!","Having never read Dan Simmons, I was impressed with his historical knowledge, his literary expertise and the general flow of the plot. Although I found Fires of Eden strange at times, I also found it thrilling and occasionally chilling. His ability to intertwine two stories at once attracted my attention. He combines history with the paranormal to form a story that captures and holds the reader's attention"
1,Ripping off Roy's fans,"Deceptively packaged ripoff (like all the Studio 99 ""tributes""). It ain't Roy. If it weren't for the people fooled/cheated by the packaging, it would never sell."
1,Do not buy,"This was the worst comforter I've ever seen. The padding on the inside was all messed up and would not lay flat, I tried to iron the actual frabric to help it shape into place, but that didn't even help. The entire thing was so misformed it wasn't funny."
4,"Great cable, but pins hard to find","This cable has the usual Monster quality (at least in their heavy duty line), but I found the tips a little hard to find. They can be readily ordered online, but don't automatically expect to wander down the street and find them at the nearest retailer.And, of course, the master tip system adds to the final cost, although the versatility is a nice touch."
4,River of Time,"I enjoyed this book and it gives a very good picture of what it was like in Southeast Asia during the 60's and 70's. The description of the fall of Phnom Penh was especially interesting. This was one of several books recommended for a trip I took to Cambodia. Read with some of the first-hand accounts from survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975-1979, you can get a real sense of what reporters at that time experienced in Southeast Asia."
2,A Ghost of Former Greatness,"Burroughs was a great writer; in many ways he was even revolutionary. However, by the time he got around to writing this VERY short novel, there was nothing new in his bag of tricks. Every sentence and situation feels like it's been pulled from the pages of one of his other books. He's said the same things before, and said them far more effectively. I finished this book because it's Burroughs and only 58 pages long, not because it was particularly compelling."
2,the eye 2 is unfocused and blurry,"ok,ok maybe i'm a little unfair and judgemental.This second film directed by the Pang brothers clearly goes in 2 directions.First it goes hollywoodish then it gets gross.The first one dealt with an eye transplant.She could see things that no one else could making her seem like she's crazy and two her eye can predict things or rather see results of circumstances before they actualy happen.The movie Premonition was identical to the Eye.This is not even close to making sense logicaly or intellectually.It's neither creepy or a horror film,its just another entry in the let's make money off of gore movies.A movie about dead babies please! We can watch the news for that kind of crap and the best part is it's for free.Folks rent the Premonition instead of this filth........ PLEASE I BEG YOU. DON'T BE A VICTIM LIKE ME"
2,Not quite as easy as I was expecting,"As a beginning quilter I got this book b/c it was supposed to be good for beginners and easy to follow. I didn't find it easy to follow or use at all and got another book instead. Of course, this could just be me. With all that said, I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't familiar with quilting."
2,Datetd,"I was disappointed in the book because it is dated - the pattern , tho, is good and can be done in more ""modern"" fabrics - just a matter of taste perhaps."
5,Delorme Atlas & Gazeteer,"These are wonderful to have when taking outdoor vacations where scenic destinations and camp sights rule. They show many back country roads you will not find on the best regular maps and they also show all well known hiking trails. They even tell you where every type of publicly owned land is in the state. I go out west every year and have one of these for Montana, WY, & CO. They are worth wile investments."
1,Not what we expected,"For the price we paid I was expecting a high quality kit, but I was unimpressed by the materials offered. We are a family stationed in Germany and I ordered the German version - since we have been here for 4 out of the 7 years of our son's life and he has been from German Kinder to German Elementary, we wanted to practice with him so that we can continue speaking German to him. Both my husband and I were unimpressed."
1,Doesn't stick,"Maybe I have a defective one, but the one we have will not stick to the window. I've cleaned the window and even moistened the cups slightly, but after putting it on the window, a few minutes later it falls down. I will be returning it."
5,Her stories are gems!,"Judy's stories are creative and clever in unexpected ways. I had to pace myself so I wouldn't finish the book too fast, each story was a treat that I looked forward to reading. Some of the stories are truly astonishing and disturbing. There is a wicked streak in stories like the cheerleader story and the first story was one of my favorites. It's definitely a book of stories you'll want to read again."
4,The hunt is over!,"MHC was a riveting read. I am pleased that John Saul has cleaned up the supernatural element in this latest action/suspense story. However the characters need more development, we also need another bit of drama going on in the sidelines. Double plotting is a great literary gimmick when the author is presenting something not terribly innovative, usually another derivative novel about crime and ugliness. Neil Gaiman certainly presents a more interesting novel about the homeless in ""Neverwhere"" And we get the best poetical immersion experience concerning the plight of the unwanted in James Herbert's ""The Others."""
2,Survivalist Writing Gets a New Name,"John Saul's novel The Manhattan Hunt Club is an intriguing piece that places it's mark among Survivalist Writings. In it Jeff Converse, a college student, is convicted of a murder he did not commit. However, things take a turn for the worse (yes, it can get worse) when he is kidnapped during a routine prison transfer, and placed in the subway system of underground Manhattan.During which, he is a pawn in a game of survival, when ""hunters"" are stalking him like game. Jeff Converse, with the help of a sexually frustrated serial killer named ""Jagger"", must fight for survival, and freedom.This has been my first read of John Saul, and even though I thought his writing was not extraordinary, found myself intrigued by his work. I think the works of David Morrell or ""The Most Dangerous Game"" do a better job of what I call ""Survivalist Fiction"", I do think this piece ranks up there with very good survivalist writing."
5,"Enjoyable,intense read",This is one of Sauls best.Of coarse he is one of my favorite writers.This starts of with and bang and kept me turning the pages to the very end.Great characters as well
2,It should be thrilling but it's not...,"In ""The Manhattan Hunt Club"" John Saul takes a premise that has been done a few times (people hunting people) and moves it to a new location. Jeff converse has been falsely accused of murder and, after his death has been faked, becomes the prey for human hunters in the maze of subway tunnels and sewer system beneath the city of Manhattan.Unfortunately, a good premise does not a good book make. Saul never manages to pull ""The Manhattan Hunt Club"" above mediocrity. His characters aren't particularly interesting and, for such an exciting concept, the novel moves at a snails pace. These problems are rounded off with suspension-of-belief breaking coincidences. Somehow Saul has managed to fail to deliver intensity from a premise that almost exudes it naturally.""The Manhattan Hunt Club"" has made for TV movie written all over it. This is at best an average offering from a well-known author.Read more reviews on our official site:[...]"
2,getting your feet wet is only the first step,"Any book that proudly uses such over-the-top buzzwords as ""insider guide"" and ""A to Z"" should really pack a lot of punch. It should be filled with useful, lengthy and original material and make the reader feel as if they have really invested their valuable time wisely.Unfortunately, the publisher name ""WetFeet"" speaks volumes about the severe limitations of this empty pamphlet. They are asking way too much money from people who are looking for jobs. They deliver only the bare essentials and hardly anything new or worthwhile.Tons of other books on this subject do a much better job: What Color is Your Parachute? is only one."
5,"Beautiful Cookbook, Beautiful Thailand","I've just been to Thailand, and there I bought this book as a present for my mother, it's not only simple to make the dishes, but also you can make the food taste just like Thai food (Wich I have to admit I LOVE IT). It's really worth paying the price for it, you don't get disapointed, besides, you can see pictures of Thailand, places, people and food, with a brief review of each region in Thailand. I enjoyed being in Thailand, and enjoyed the book beeing back in Chile, enjoy it yourself."
5,"I LIKE THE CONTENTS, BUT...","This is an outstanding cookbook and a must for any avid Thai cook. My wife is Thai and when she saw this book, she was shocked to see some recipes that she have not seen (and had) since she was in Thailand many moons ago. I was very impressed and very delighted with this book and I strongly recommend it. The recipes, if carried out to the letter, are authentic and worth trying.That said. The book is too large and bulky to carry with you to the kitchen while you are preparing dishes. Additionally, the pages are glossy and for sure you don't want set it on the kitchen counter. In order to preserve the book condition, it is best that you write down the recipe on paper. I am not deducting any points because of this incovenience though I wish to take off a quarter point for that.Overall, I am very pleased."
5,A wonderful book!,"I think the only serious competition for this book isThai Food, and I would cautiously award the blue ribbon to this book, if only because it contains lots and lots of recipes that I have actually seen and tasted, whileThai Foodseems to have a lot of recipes like ""Beef and Mangosteen Soup,"" which I have never heard of, much less tasted. I suspect that a lot of this may be Royal Thai Cuisine, which is undoubtedly delicious but rather requires a kitchen full of servants.(!)This book, on the other hand, shows you how to cook such everyday items as ""Pork Fried Rice"" (and their version looks GREAT) plus dozens of other items. In fact, if you know of a Thai dish and cannot find it in this book, that will be a big exception.Full marks for the lovely photographs as well! Just leafing through this wonderful book will make you hungry."
5,I've eaten over 4000 meals in Thailand and LOVE this book.,"I had the great fortune to live in Thailand for seven years. I never learned to cook because the food was too good and cheap in the markets. When I returned to the US I was given this cookbook and was, I'll admit, skeptical, because it's so big and glossy....'Just didn't look like a real cookbook.It is an EXCELLENT cookbook for three reasons: First, everything I've made in it tastes authentic. Secondly, the photographic glossary clearly shows what different ingredients look like. Finally, almost every dish is pictured.This, in combination with David Thompson's new cookbook, are the only two Thai cookbooks I'll ever need."
5,jagged alliance 2 gold,"great game, welll worth the price. I wish there more more of these genre of games"
3,Excellent Performances,A fine film that needs a DVD release. The Uav VHS tape (blue box) is a transfer of a poor print - both picture and sound. The film was also released by Warner Brothers on VHS. That one is probably of much better quality.
5,Six Stars,"Roslyn Carrington paints a vivid picture of life in Trinidad - so vivid that you are transported there to experience it with all of your senses. She has an exceptional ability to view the world through the eyes of her characters. And this is an intriguing, enchanting world which most outsiders never see. An interplay of quiet dramas takes place within a small residential courtyard. The central characters, a mother and daughter, face identical problems, but are unable to share them with each other. The other characters each have their own stories which are woven expertly into the fabric of the central theme. An outstanding reading experience! You will want the story to continue!"
4,desired look for my project,"desired look for my project, desired look for my project, desired look for my project,desired look for my project, desired look for my project"
5,This group is unique,"Ernie Haase and Signature Sound are not only fine musicians, but their brand of soundis very delicate and compelling. The touch of their pianist is also delicate and refreshing.I'm delighted that Amazon makes their music available"
4,A good starter sampler of ambient music,"This recording is a collaboration between Roach and other luminaries in the ambient music field. The music is not challenging, which is to say it's a good place to start if you're interested in exploring the ambient world. I heard some of this CD on the Public Radio show ""Music from the Hearts of Space"", and was quite taken with it, even though my background is, shall we say, rather ""square"" -- I live on Bach and English church music.The cut that first got my attention was ""Point of Safety"". It was intriguing enough to get me to buy the CD. Since then, I have obtained several others, mostly by Roach (if you like this one, I'd suggest ""Quiet Music"" and the relatively new ""Midnight Moon""). Since this recording is a collaboration with other artists, you get more than just Roach. I haven't been able to assimilate some of the other artists as easily as I have Roach's music."
5,Good product series from Leapfrog,Good product. 4 1/2 year twin boys like it very much though the word factory (complex words - with silent vowels etc.) is at a higher level for them.
5,These DVD's are the BEST,"As a homeschooling parent of 8, I've been there - done that with most educational products out there. A friend recommended these videos to me, and it was only her fervent insistance that they were the best thing out there that made me willing to buy them. I have to say I have been REALLY impressed! I was hoping my four year old would enjoy them, but I have to admit they have captivated the entire family. (Even my 13yo ds stops to watch when he enters the room. Shhh, don't tell that I told you.) The songs are very catchy, and the kids really do learn from them. I was shocked to find my 4yo and 2yo were talking about the sounds different letters made and trying to draw them on paper, and my 2nd graders even benefitted from the reviews of long and short vowel sound words. I've not tried the other Leapfrog products, but these videos have impressed me enough to make me want to try them."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed in the quality of these pads. Did not absorb much of anything. Would not recommend this product.
4,Great for the diaper change table,I find these excellent for our home diaper change table as it saves spills on the material change mat. They are very absorbent when those accidents happen before the diaper gets put back on! They are fairly inexpensive and last quite a few diaper changes as well since they are just there as a safety guard. Also great to have in the car when you are pregnant incase you have an emergency run to the hospital!
3,"Good, but not as good as the ones I had in the hospital","I was looking for chux like the ones that the hospital provided for changing my newborn. Unfortunately, the top layer of this seems to separate from the bottom layers too easily. They work okay, but I am still looking for the ones I had from the hospital."
2,Puppy Pads,I purchased these for my Chinese Crested pup that is in quarantine right now. He is a very small dog (5 lbs) and his urine leaked through these pads. They are pretty small but that is ok but I have used many pads and I rarely have issues with any leaking especially under the plastic. I would not recommend these to anyone really because they are too this and have nothing to absorb even a small dogs urine. I love my dog but that doesn't mean I want to be cleaning up the tile when he pees in the right spot! I always prefer the washable bed pads to throw away but for situations where you need to dispose of the pad there are much better options that are not that much more expensive. Trust me a few pennies is worth not getting on the floor scrubbing pee.
4,The tour de force of the gamebook genre,"As part one of the Sorcery series, this book starts slowly, but grows in stature by the end. Published initially as a boxed set with the Spell Book (which was to be required for all the successive books) but later all books were republished with the spells in the back. A copy of the original set is very rare"
2,poor,I was very dispointed with the product I receive. I ordered enamel over stainless steel burner covers. And what I received was made out of tin. I didn't want tin ones I can buy those anywhere. I plan on sending them back.
3,Fine For Cable TV,"I found that the 8-way works fine to split cable TV services. However I had a loss of signal in splitting to my regular Digital Phone Service, an older Comcast Phone service (not VOIP). There also was a loss connecting to my internet Modem.I was hoping to consolidate all into this one Splitter, but I had to go back to a four way followed by a two way combination."
4,They've come a long way from here,"I'm glad this album wasn't my first Hypnogaja experience, or I'd probably have skipped over them. Their later work is MUCH better, and while you can hear the seed of what they've become this album is definitely not their best work. I'm glad they decided not to continue with the girl. Not that she doesn't have talent or a great voice, but she doesn't fit with the overall sound, which is obvious once you compare this album to their other work."
2,SierraSil is the Miracle Mineral,Wandering what this book is about? It's about a natural mineral deposit found in the sierra mountains called SierraSil. You can read all about it on the SierraSil website and don't need to buy the book.
4,Anita is outstanding on this live recording...,Anita O'Day is at her peak on this highly enjoyable set of jazz standards with the wonderful John Poole at the drums. The only problem is the sound quality. It seems they didn't have a good sound system(considering that this was recorded in the 70's. Still the music is so enjoyable and her voice is so at it's peak tha tyou can overlook the sound quality. O'Day takes plenty of chances and swings constantly. Highly recommended.
4,Billy is back,"After hearing the new Zwan record I can't help but feel a bit of excitement knowing that, once again, Billy Corgan and a new batch of talented musicians are back on the scene creating music that rocks outside the box. In a world of nu-metal, Ppearl Jam [takes], and nu-grunge it's refreshing to hear a voice from the recent past bringing a cool new blend of rock energy. The album, although not as pleasing to the ear as the smashing pumpkins, proves to be some very good music! I recomend this cd to anyone who appreciates creativity in their rock! Thank God Jimmy is back on drums again as well~!"
4,A little bit of sunshine...,"Happy rock. We can't always be dark and brooding, can we? I love the feel of this whole album...Zwan is definitely not the Smashing Pumpkins, though. As great as they were, it is an era that has seen its time. Corgan is moving on and evolving his sound into something that is sure to have far reaching appeal. This is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of this album - experiencing another level of Corgan. I love watching artists grow and change...IT'S A GOOD THING! Definitely recommend picking this one up. Throw it in on a cloudy day while you're driving with the windows down...bring in a little bit of sunshine!"
3,"A pleasure to read, but","This book is very elegant, a pleasure to read, but not a great textbook -- after reading you are likely not to remember anything other than having enjoyed it (this is particularly true of the proof of Dirichlet's theorem). For actually learning to work in the subject (of analytic number theory), Davenport's bookMultiplicative Number Theoryis VASTLY superior."
2,Lack of precision,"While I applaud the author's creativity in showing lots of variations on a basic pattern (the sloper or block), I have lots of concerns about the accuracy of the final pattern using this method. She doesn't account for deformation and merely ""tracing"" the item doesn't give a decent pattern. Her recommendation for correcting errors is to compare them to a commercial pattern (which seems to defeat the purpose here).I'm afraid the reader will spend far more time correcting the pattern than just going out and buying a commercial pattern and adjusting it to the style of their existing clothes.I recommend Patterns from Finished Clothes: Re-Creating the Clothes You Love by Tracy Doyle for a more precise technique."
5,Cheaper and more satisfying than buying patterns that don't fit!,"I bought this book when it was new and have used Bensussen's method successfully for many years. The point of making a pattern this way is to preserve/reproduce the style and cut (fit) of a particular garment, rather than attempting to alter a commercial pattern to fit the way something you already own already fits. If you lack confidence in your drafting ability, Bensussen advises checking sleeve caps and armholes against commercial patterns, but this is redundant: The accuracy of your pattern can be checked by pinning your traced seam lines onto the seam lines of the original garment and adjusting as necessary. Or you could just learn how to draft a sleeve :)"
2,Vague and hard to follow,"This book is outdated and the instructions for recreating patterns are vague. The book has limited pictures, though very skillful fashion drawings. This book would better be used a supplement to another, more technical book."
5,Tip Of An Iceberg,"Wake up people, read this fantastic book, if only more writers likeWilliam Blum research and write books like ""Rouge State"" we would atleast know (a little at least) of the rotten truths that the USGovernment is keeping from the public ( all in the new name ofNational Security)Come forward ex-employee's of Government Departments, expose their warcrimes.Well done William Blum."
2,SIGN OF THE TIMES,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE IN AMERICA. WITHOUTINDIVIDUALS LIKE MR. BLUM, MOST AMERICANS WOULD HAVE NO IDEA HOWTHIS COUNTRY HAS CHANGED FROM A PLACE OF HOPE TO A CHILLINGDARK UNDERSIDE OF HATRED. MR. BLUM STATES VERY FEW FACTS, JUSTOPIONIONS THAT SATISFY THE LOONY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS THAT QUITEFRANKLY JUST PLAIN HATE THIS GREAT COUNTRY. HE SHOULD WORK ONTHE ALIEN THEORY NEXT."
5,CONTROVERCIAL,"A disturbing picture of the USA. Even if partially true, it's a bombshell. Apparently Bin Laden's favorite book. We sit in the USA very unaware of all our nation does world wide."
2,Good subject matter but bad presentation,"First of all, the subject matter is very engaging. The issue is that the pages are barely readable. This edition is a photocopy of the original and the actual image size is much smaller than the size of the book. Add to this that some pages are blurry and reading becomes a challenge. Every now and then, one page is blank, which shows the level of care which went into this edition. Mayhew deserves better treatment."
3,Bland overall with amaturist dances by several nice figured girls,"Dancing is primary impersonal, with just sways and twists between pointless talking, breasts bare only, but last segment has highlights along a very nice vocal ballad, although pretty cheesy in production.Probably worth a low used price depending on what your looking for."
2,I was disappointed...,"I was disappointed in the Handbook for Beginning Legal Assistants and Receptionists. When I bought the book, I didn't realize that the copywright date was 1989, but I wish I had because some of the information seemed outdated. I also noticed quite a few typographical errors in the book, which didn't help me trust the content."
3,"Good Walker, specs on the page are wrong.",I bought this walker for my grandmother who is only 5 feet tall. The specs says that the walker arms can go down to 28 inches. This is wrong. They go to 32 inches at the lowest. This is way too tall for my grandmother. The quality of the walker seems good if your tall enought to use it.
2,Irregularity should be disclosed,"I bought this wheeled walker about a month ago to replace one for my great grandmother. It came on time - that was the good part. When I took it out of the box and assembled it - it looked like it'd be bought and returned before, which is fine with me if there's no problem with the item, BUT it was clearly wielded together in the manufacturing process at a slightly off angle. The metal frame's angles were visibly not square. It doesn't really affect it's functioning, which seems fine, if with a very slight lean to the left, but it really gives a visual impression of veering left. Aside from this major flaw with the particular one sent to me, know that the seat is rather high - a tad too high for my (now) 5ft tall grandmother. Otherwise it seems sturdy and well made. I think this could be a good deal if you get a good one - so go ahead and order, just check it out very well and be prepared to return it if there are issues."
4,Rolling Walker with padded seat and basket,"Bought this for my mom after her stroke for half the money in a store, store price $180. After her stroke she was very weak and felt heavy this rollator supports her great! She loves it, it is sturdy, safe, steers great and rolls easily. Great product for a great price. Only draw back is assembly, I was all thumbs! Thanks Amazon and Giga Dollar."
3,Uncertain,"My purchase is quite recent, the winter weather persists, so I have not yet used my rolling walker. Because I haven't used it, I cannot realisticly rate it's performance. Overall first impression is good. The seat cover appears flimsy and poorly put together, so I'm expecting a problem there -- hope I'm wrong. I know I could have paid more and received better quality, but already being 85 I didn't think it would have to hold up too long."
3,rollabout walker,It is easy to assemble. The walker is light weight and easy to collapse to put in the car. The fact that the front wheels are stationary (go only forward or backward) makes the walker difficult for a weakened disabled person to maneuver on angle turns. Would be better for us if the front wheels rotated 360 degrees.
5,My 100 year old great Aunt loves it!,"My 100 year old aunt is a wonder. She hikes the halls of the apartment complex she lives in everyday. She lives on her own, no nursing home for her. She is sharp, manages her finances, visits with the neighbors, goes to the bank and grocery store. One day she did mention to me that she got a little tired walking to the end of the hall and that it would be nice to sit down and rest a bit before heading back to her apartment. She hated to admit it but a walker might be helpful. I shopped on Amazon and found a really nice rolling walker with a seat. It arrived in just a couple of days. She was absolutely thrilled with it. It fits her perfectly, carries her purse when she goes out, and is just what she needed. Her neighbors have nicknamed her Flash. Great product. I highly recommend it."
3,not as described,"product description says the seat is adjustable --no it is not. it is welded in place to only one height. the handlebars have an adjustable height, but I wanted a lower than normal seat for my short mother. so the product description is wrong, or they sent me the wrong thing.Also said it could be put together easily without tools--not true. We needed to tighten the brakes with a wrench before it would lock.Otherwise, it is okay."
2,Mediocre,"My first double edged shaving set came with these blades, and they were satisfactory.I recently tried another brand(Gillette 7 oclock) and was surprised at how much better they were.The Merkur blades work just fine, but for the same price you can do much better."
4,expensive blade but good product,"These blades are more expensive on the whole than some of the others like derby or sharp but with my thick beard they really don't do any better shaving than the others. I use an expensive Mekur razor but, again, these baldes aren't any better than some of the other blades but do tend to cost more."
5,Full of Inspiration,"This book just screams ""play with me!"" I love the use of color and the technique is easy enough to follow. Great for the adventurous or advanced beginner, though some would disagree with me on that point. Other books to consider with this one would be Ginger Luters's Module Magic and Horst Schulz's Patchwork Knitting books."
4,There is something for everyone on this CD!,"Stop with the Dame Edna insults! She performed with the blessing of Mr. Sondheim - helped sell tickets for an excellent charity - and thrilled both the audience and cast. The cast members filled the wings to hear the Great Dame! The audience was in stitches. The London Philharmonic was in top form. And while one reviewer may not like Michael Ball - he has legions of fans that do love him. Julia Mackenzie's Barcelona is awesome! Admittedly I am biased about this CD - but rest assured, there is something for everyone on this recording. And the sales of the CD benefit the Alan J. Lerner Cancer Charity!"
5,: Who will conduct a Beethoven Symphony after him?.,"1942: It's wartime. Once more Wilhelm Fürtwangler conducts this work. But this is not another additional performance.Fürtwangler has decided that evening that the Ninth must elevate far beyond the podium and the hall. Something in the enviroment will be shocked since the first bars.In the First Movement the cosmic fury and the tragic mood face one each other.The Adagio is a true Requiem; the baton of W.F. works out as Achilles sword. This Symphony that evening will mean a clear message for the present listeners and thinking about the listeners of the future: the end is near.Never before in the story of the music a performance will resound like this one. The intrepretative violence is not gratuite: Every time Fürtwnagler conducted Beethoven it was a true ritual a real cathartic experience.This historical recording overpasses by far, all the adjectives to become a cosmic experience.Who will conduct a Beethoven Symphony after him?."
1,Nothing practical,"I bought this book, but regretted it. There is nothing practical in this book. Mostly introduces lots and lots of different, unrelated, mechanical things such as gears, pulleys, etc. Has a completely useless chapter on walking robots, mostly about linkabes."
1,What was George smoking?,"I don't know what would cause George Lynch to involve himself with this unprecedented degradation to his usually excellent taste in music; I perhaps have never been so shocked as when I listened to that junk while fully expecting to hear another of Lynch's usual--awesome hard rock. What happened? Korn? Oh, no..."
3,Not what you would expect,"Having listened to just about everything George Lynch has done, this is not what I expected. If you're looking for classic 80's melodic metal, go get the new Dokken and Def Leppard albums. Smoke This is a blend of hip-hop and metal. It's taking time to grow on me but I have not given up yet. Just be prepared for what this music is and what it is not."
1,"Painful to listen to, even for just a moment.","""Smoke This"" is an appropriate title, because obviously Lynch was smoking something that really messed up his mind for him to think this mess sounds good to ANYONE.If you buy this excepting it to sound like Dokken you are in for a BIG surprise. Don't say we didn't warn you."
2,Beware Mob Fans!,"The greatness of Mr Scary has taken a complete 360! His sound is now a hybrid of metal,hip-hop,and rap. There are about 4 songs that are enjoyable to me, the rest can go to file 13. Do not get me wrong, I am a huge Lynch fan(the guy is a mastermind on the fretboard), just do not like this cd very well. I will give it to George for getting enough nerve and trying a new sound. He knew he would lose some fans and gain some new ones. If all the songs on the album had the punch of ""Hollow"" or ""What Do You Want"", this might be a 5 star cd. If all you old school Lynch/Dokken fans want to hear the stuff George is respected for, he has a new instrumental cd coming out first part of next year. I think it will put a lot of the criticism and negativity to rest! Thank heaven for George Lynch, new or old style!"
2,What happened?,"I'm a Dokken and Lynch Mob fanatic, but when I heard this album, I could not believe the change in music style. Lynch Mob meets rap..doesn't work! I was expecting Oni to be back singing, but when I bought the CD, it was somebody different. Go back to your roots George and stop selling out to your fans."
5,"great, great, great",can't get a band with more heart and soul. This band is different and i love the emotion in their music. I highly recommend their album! What Ya waiting for: BUY IT!!!
5,The Fans Are The Winner,"Wow. Now we know what Marty sounds like outside the confines of the clueless opinions of the members of Michael Hutchences' former back up band. Rock 'N Roll as it's meant to be played, without apologies. INXS is history. Long live the Lovehammers."
3,repeat,"I thought this CD was a repeat of the Lovehammers first CD. Marty DID take advice from INXS and stopped screaming so much but some of the remakes just didn't sound as good as the originals. The CD is good but if you purchased the first Love Hammers CD the only song really missing from it is ""Trees."" I look forward to some new material."
3,phone just dies in converstaion,"this has happened at least 6 times after getting my phone 2 months ago. during a conversation, suddenly i can't hear anything and pushing bottoms (except pushing the shut-down bottom hard) doesn't work either. i have to re-start the phone and apologize to the person that was on the phone. this phone is an eye-candy, but it has a quality of M$ windows 98."
2,Nice but has issues,The KRZR is a really cool looking phone - but it has 2 huge issues - a very short battery life (1 day) and sllloooowwww reaction time - push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up.I would explore other options.
1,Terrible Quality,"This phone was terrible from the start. The screen would flash in and out and it would freeze constantly. These clam shell phones are known for having problems with their screens. I will never buy a clamshell phone again. I ended up bying a cheap Chinese phone because I thought it would be better than this miserable phone, and it is."
3,"An original perspective, a worthy effort, but...","...I would tend to agree with an earlier reviewer who spoke of this work as a ""religious tract."" The author seems so invested in his thesis of ""revolution as Satanic plot"" that he does tend to beat the reader over the head--and also seems to give Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the doomed king and queen of the time, more credit as rulers than they are due, based on his own admiration for thier personal piety and good character. Those familiar with more recent history need look no further than Nicholas II and Alexandra of Russia (and Alexandra, somewhat ironically, strongly identified with Marie Antoinette) to realize that one can be personally devout, upright and ethical, yet a complete disaster as a ruler. Given the nature of the subject, getting any ""ultimate"" insight into the minds of those 16 nuns may be an impossible task--writing as a hagiographer, conciously or not, is not perhaps the best way to come close."
5,Cool Camcorder. Easy to Use. Compact. Nightshot system is great too!,"This camcorder was purchased to replace my 250. It is great! It has sony's nightspot system, and is really easy to use, and transfer digital images to my computer. Love it!"
3,NOT backward compatible,"This model is NOT backward compatible with old analogue Hi8 tapes. So, if you have some old footage from your old analogue camcorder that you want to dump into the computer, this is NOT the camera for you. I was told by the store that it would play them, but it doesn't. And Sony also agreed that it does not. That feature is not available until the 460. <br /><br />I can't comment on the record side of this camera, because I never even tested that. I tested its ability to play old tape first, and it does not, so back it goes."
4,Does the job,"I bought this case for my wife's phone. She was not disappointed. The case is attractive, and snugly fits the Omnia 7 phone."
4,Hard tech step mix for the true dnb massive,"Dieselboy puts forth a tightly mixed CD of aggressive drum n bass. The flavor of his live set is captured well here. He also drops one of his own tracks ""Atlantic State"" which is getting dropped repeatedly by drum n bass DJs throughout the world. If you like drum n bass and are not afraid of aggressive beats, pick up this CD."
2,Diesel boy has done better,3 count'em 3 good songs and a cool intro... That's it! Oh wait the cover art was good.
5,This book is an excellent reference to telecommunication,"This book is an excellent reference to telecommunication engineers, providing features, equipments and data about Installation Optical Network. It's easy to read, besides being one of the most important literary composition about this matter. It's useful to optical projects, exhibiting the technical data by a practical way. So, without the slightest doubt, it's important to purchase it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"While Shirley Maclaine and Kevin Costner had their moments, the main character, played by Jennifer Aniston, well, let's put it this way; just watch a rerun of ""Friends"", and you'll see the same character: whiney, juvenile, and not movie material. Within minutes of watching this film, I knew I had wasted my good money.Shirley Maclaine had some great lines, and for that, I'll grudgingly give the movie one star. The lead actor played very well, despite the woman cast opposite of him.Brad, we know why you left her, and I'm sure you're sleeping much better these days, even with two kids climbing all over you."
3,"The gimmick works, pretty much","The movie has the gimmick, ""the Graduate"" going for it. The movie has engaging actors, Aniston and Costner are very good. I smiled rather than laugh through the movie. Aniston pulls off the character, who played by anybody else would be an unlikeable character. You still like Aniston even though she treats her boyfriend like trash for most of the movie. Costner plays it just right, handsome, charming, and a bit of a rascal. You believe the women of this family falling for him.The movie in the last analysis is cotton candy. You really don't care that much if the main character gets together with lawyer boyfriend. It was a pleasant way to spend two hours, but they should have played more Simon and Garfunkel music. It would have helped."
3,Should've and Could've,"A great director, and good cast, and a story that sounds really interesting. Why wasn't this better? Aniston is likeable, but doesn't really blow you away with her performance. Ruffalo has some funny lines, and MacLaine is a hoot as the grandmother. Costner does his charming bit well. The story basically involves a young woman(Aniston) who is engaged to a lawyer(Ruffalo). They are coming home for the marriage of her sister. Aniston is very uncertain of herself and of her engagement. When she learns that her family might be the basis for the book/movie ""The Graduate"", she goes out to find the man who bedded her grandmother and mother and could possibly be her father. After that, things fall flat for me. This one is not for me."
5,Brings back memories,Great entertainment especially for someone who is about to be a Grandmother for the first time. I really enjoyed it.
1,Aniston wrecks it again. What little there was.,"With Jennifer Aniston, it always seems you know what's going to happen in a film. There's never a mystery of surprise in any movie I've seen her in. Terrible acting. Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine's parts weren't any funnier. I'll save you time here. THIS REVIEW NOT HELPFUL."
2,Shirley,"Interesting Story, but a typical airplane movie (which I where I saw it accidentaly). The acting is ok but not their best, and Reiner... well, let's say he will forever be a god for making Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally. This movie, how clever interwoven it is with The Graduate, didn't do anything.Extra star for Shirley MacLaine, she is great in this one."
3,OK I guess,"Kept thinking that Sarah(Jennifer Anniston's character) was a selfish little brat through out the whole film. The story was fairly interesting, but predictable. Costner was good and so was McLane but the actor who played Jeff Daily was the best part about the entire. Mark Ruffalo should be commended for an excellent performance. He is the heart and conscience of the picture."
3,"INTERESTING TAKE-OFF ON ""THE GRADUATE""","A fairly amusing Jennifer Anniston vehicle, RUMOR HAS IT...stays afloat thanks to some excellent performances from the cast (particularly Shirley Maclaine and Kevin Costner) and the script's dextrous realization of some very complex characters and their multi-layered interractions with one another. Anniston is attractive and mostly likeable as the easily confused protagonist, and Mark Ruffalo is highly convincing as her dissed fiance'. Nowhere nearly as good as THE GRADUATE (from which RUMOR HAS IT...takes its cue) but it is almost possible to see these people playing out that classic's comedy-drama for themselves. And even though it's directed by Rob Reiner, at least he has enough sense to keep his personal politics out of the plot. Unless you're a big fan of some of the cast I wouldn't really recommend buying this one, but it might make a good date movie or a cute but harmless rental."
1,Poor design and low quality,"I was very disappointed with this item. The first problem is that the insertion holes are simply too small to accommodate larger diameter higher quality cables. (Yes, like the one's that Monster sells.) Conversely, if you decide to use pin connectors on your cables (also from Monster), then you'll find that the spring loaded receptacles are so weak and flimsy that your cables will constantly pop out. I suffered using one of these for about 6 months until one of the connectors finally just broke, rendering the entire device useless. Honestly I find it baffling that Monster would design and sell a unit like this that is essentially incompatible with their core products. Obviously their design choices were made in the interest of cost rather than quality and function."
2,"Ok for the price, but read the fine print","It does not hold the wires very tight. Because it was from monster cable, I suspect it was made this way on purpose so that you would buy their connectors. If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased a more universal product,next time I will read the fine print before ordering. For a $20.00 item it does the job adaquately."
2,"not natural looking, too concentrated","color is way too black, not mixed wel in container, messy, discolors fabrics, don't recommend this except for possible halloween contume product,"
3,"It works, but with some draw backs.","My boyfriend has always been self conscious about his crop circle on the back of his head, so I found this spray and ordered it for him. When he first used it I thought WOW!! his problem is solved in seconds and for under $10.00 too. It was amazing, you couldn't even tell. The only problem is that periodically through the evening while we were out, he would forget he had this on his head and would touch his hair. The stuff came off on his hands. However, we danced a lot that evening and it did not drip from sweat thank goodness. It came off on the pillow as well. All in all it still does the job, and looks great."
3,A neat movie!,"This is a good movie! I see that a lot of people don't like it. I'll admit it's slow, but it has a good lesson. I mean, it's totally patriotic and wonderful! You can really see how patriotic the Duke was. James Arness costars and is cool. I enjoy watching it every so often, and I think it's a good movie. That's my humble opinion!"
4,Good Film,"This movis tries to show the viewer that the House Un-American Activities Committee is(the present tense applies to the time this film was made and released)a noble and necessary function of the Federal government. We know better today. John Wayne plays a government agent, with his partner James Arness, who investigates the undercover agents of Russia in Hawaii. Nancy Olson is the romantic interest This is actually a good movie that I have Enjoyed watching several times. Recommened."
5,Great CD,"This is another album that Missy and Timbaland had their hands all in. I like the way the album is organized, and I also like how this girl is singing songs geared towards a younger audience. She's not talking about Let's Get It On, she's more to sticking to that Let's Wait Awhile. And I likes that."
1,Delphi DVD,"Terrible. I paid a professional installer to put this unit in on Saturday and it was broken by Monday. It makes all sorts of noise even when it is not on, leading to believe it IS on, killing my battery, it wouldn't play any DVD's today and the screen went green. Wouldn't eject the DVD, wouldn't turn off. Took it to the installer this morning and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. They said they'd seen quite a few that went bad like this. Hoping the manufacturer warranty will cover me but I still paid installation that won't be reimbursed. My advice, don't bother. A waste of money and a heartbreaker for the kids."
4,Helpful,"This is a great resource to have. However, I have found that you need to be open to other methods of discipline. This is quite informative and a great resource to have on your shelf."
4,Minus one for being boring.,"This book was okay, and I really could identify with the character, but at times, the story was a bit boring. The ending wasn't all that great either. It was more like a down with the system book."
4,Man's Favorite Sport?,Classic Howard Hawks swrew ball comedy. Rock Hudson played Rock Hudson to the T while Paula P over did the character at times. The comic routines were entertaining with the rest of the supporting cast complemented the story.
5,One of Rock's Best,This is one of Rock Hudson's best light comic films. I saw it when I was a kid and I really enjoyed it. It still holds up today. A film may be light and it may be comic but as the best of its kind it has something to say about how we as human beings conduct our lives. This is a good film.
5,Great old movie,"A hilarious old movie involving fishing and the trouble a beautiful girl, on a mission to publicise her friends resort, get one poor man into."
2,Cryptic,"This book was apparently written by Math PHDs for use by Math PHDs. I found it to be pretty impenetrable. With this sort of language report, and the shortage of ""how to"" books for beginners, SML is probably doomed to obscurity, which is unfortunate."
3,good but falls short.,"This product rather than push button on and off switch should have had individual volume control in order to better serve my purposes. The differences in individual speakers make that important and imperative. In addition, further speakers require more boost than the the ones closer."
1,Don't be deceived,"His theology may cause the reader to ""perk-up"" his ears. But that is because it is different from what he has heard in his mainline church. Swedenborg's theology is full of errors and what could only be called heresies in most evangelical churches. He was a brilliant man and there are some tasty bits here, but they are laced with spiritual rat poison. I reccommend you stay away."
5,The most complete description of eternal life ever written!,"Swedenborg, who saw into the heavens and hells when the Lord opened his spiritual sight, describes the life of heaven and the life of hell in this book (one of more than 30 books he wrote under the Lord's direct guidance). When one dies, he or she lives to eternity in the place that best matches the loves he or she has fostered in his or her heart and mind while on earth. This book describes the places and the people! In heaven, people are married, go to work (work that they love), play (have recreation) and worship the Lord. They have spiritual bodies in the same form as earthly bodies, except there is no illness of any kind. Read this book (and other books penned by Emanuel Swedenborg) if you want a new perspective on God, life, faith and good works."
4,Deeply Intriguing Romantic Saga,"A great historical romance that allows the mind to wander along some of the most intriguing times of the 20th century. If there was ever a woman I would like to emulate it would be Helene, this character is truly the definition of a Phoenix, and her rising from ashes again and again to make her life a fulfilled one and truly incredible. The author simply is amazing with her talent for balancing three differnt era's and societal factions in a truly imaginitive story."
5,Best Book Ever!,"This book takes you into the life of Taylor Connolly. Having lost his boyfriend, he seeks help from his best friend Gen Pouissant.He leaves the city to get far enough away from his ex-boyfriend, but still close enough to keep his job. Just coming out of a 'long-term' relationship, he wasn't expecting to meet someone like Tom McEwan. Was he ready to be in a relationship so close to his recent breakup?The book tells you what happens between Tom and Taylor and shows you which choice they both make.You will love this book.I read it in one day and I laughed so hard and maybe added a couple of ""awwwwwww"" 's in their too.I can't wait to see what happens next in Finding Peace, and I recomend this book to everyone."
1,About a bad as a novel can be,"I foolishly believed some of the reviews I had read on this site and bought this book. This is dreary stuff from start to finish. The writing is so dull that we get no sense of who these characters are, nor do we care. Vacuous and simple-minded, this is a book entirely without conflict and the characters are evidently modeled on some romance novel cliche. Anyone with a reading level beyond pre-adolescence or who admires intelligent writing should avoid this weak and disappointing effort."
5,"Review of one chapter ""American Girls, Raised on Promises""","The chapter ""American Girls, Raised on Promises"" is fantastic. It's a critical look at the differences between the way culture and gender have been viewed through the lens of rock music lyrics in the 80s compared to the 90s, then extended to views of women and bodybuilding. In particular Ms. Haywood focuses on the poignant and ironic song ""American Girls"" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and how Petty manages to describe to perfection the way young women in America, esp. the 30-somethings, feel about the gap between what we were raised to believe we could do and the hard realities of the world. I keep coming back to this essay again and again because it says so much about me, like a little wound that needs licking."
1,Leonard Maltin's 2003 Movie And Video Guide,"I have been buying Mr. Maltin's book for over ten years and am always disappointed that it is never up to date. It you are going to call a book a 2003 reference you should include most of the best movies of the previous year. I realize that many of the best of the year do not come out until November/December, but if Mr. Maltin can't get an advance copy to review he should delay publication until he can include at least some of the top 25 and/or Golden Globe/Academy Award nominee's. The 2003 book has 2 0r 3 of the 2002 25 best, and none of the award nominee's."
1,dont waste your money!,"I just saw these two in concert. they looked interesting, so i thought, hey, i'll go see them...little did i know that they are a couple of insecure, talentless women who wish they had something that men do.....the whole show was about how angry thay are to be lesbian women....get over it! i'm sure glad this is to be their last tour together....save your money, dont buy this cd, do not support people that are so hateful and angry.....in a time when we need more love in this world....."
3,Gateway's LCD,"Here im going to give you the pros and cons on the Gateway 18"" LCD Flat Panel TV (which is an subpar LCD TV)Pros- nice silver finnish- pretty nice sound for size- component input- s-videoCons- why is this not 16:9-its a Freaken GATEWAY people- no HDsupport- sort of blocky picture- reds are alittle to deepoverall i give this LCD a 7.9 for good, perfect for a teen's room but i suggest going to www.dell.com to purchase there 17"" 16:9 LCD which has HD support and the picture is of better quality."
4,Great show,What can you say about Paul Rodgers. One of the all time greats. Check out the 16 year old guitar player he found. Kid is good. Also check out the tune Paul's son performs. The legacy continues...
5,Paul Rodgers - Live in Glasgow,I have purchased 3 copies of this DVD so far. It's one of the most entertaining videos of a band I have seen. Paul Rodgers is a great rock vocalist. I hope he puts out many more DVD's....
4,Uber radio-friendly,"I picked this album up at one of her showcases, half expecting it to be some slickly-produced, nicely-packaged fluffy pop album. It turned out to be a tad more than i'd bargained for. I granted this album a couple of repeats on my CD player, so did the people around me, possibly because the tracks are uber radio-friendly. For instance, Tata evokes sensuality on the track, ""Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy"": ""...people think it's intimidating when a girl is cool with her sexuality... I'm a 180 to the stereotype girls like staying home and being innocent...""The first few tracks are indeed the more noticeable ones on the album, including the title track ""I Believe"". If you're the occasional pop listener looking for a feel-good pop album, this is one album worth listening to."
2,Overpriced for what it is,"I would expect a book thats title is ""big book"" would be more then a paperback binder more then a couple of hundred pages long. I would think that there would be a lot more balloon art. But there were big gaps and I may have well have just stuck to you tube to learn. It has been a good reference point but at the end of the day over priced for what I got."
5,the best ballooning book on the market,"As a hobby balloonist, I have found this to be the best book on the market. Many other balloon art guides offer the basics, and one or two advanced creations. This book offers the most bang for your buck (or pop for your penny), providing not only the ""how-to"" for all flavours of folds, twists, seeds, and other techniques, but non-traditional models--motorcycles, mermaids, lobsters, moose, bicycles...the list goes on. From beginner to expert, this book will please all but the most advanced balloonist, and maybe even teach the advanced balloonist a thing or two."
3,Interesting but not up to date.,"Here is a biography that should be revisedto include Mr Walters latest years and exploits.His regard for his master still comes through.Otherwise it is a bit weak on original ideas,more like a mellow stroll.Also recommended;Newer Editions of ""Autobiography of a Yogi"""
3,Tales of Hollywood,The tape contained some interesting historical information; however the background music was very annoying! Reliford
2,If your think you're getting all the Top 40 singles-NOT,"VERY DISAPPOINTING.Record companies are always so upset why people download songs & not buy the CD's/music & end up paying the licensing fees to everyone. I agree that the artists & people involved in the songs get paid. YET... IT IS SO FRUSTRATING that the record companies screw the collectors/consumers over. Case in point..Classic singles Nat King Cole DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE ALL THE TOP 40 SINGLES, much less all the charting top 100 hits. None of the box sets do. It enough to have to make an honest person download the boot legs. If u want an all inclusive Box set of Classic Singles THIS IS NOT IT!!!!!!"
2,"Great product, good features, but bad company!","The Ergodex idea is awesome, the board itself is fantastic, the company though just plain sucks.Don't believe anything on their forums since they edit the posts of others to say what they want.Don't believe their main site, it's said Vista drivers are in beta testing for almost a year now.Want mac support? Sure! Just toss us another $32 on top of whatever you've already paid to purchase the ""upgraded"" software.Really a fantastic product with poor software support (nothing past XP) and lousy company direction.If your stuck in the stone age of computing and want to dump more money into an old PC then sure, pick this up. If you want to progress beyond XP to Vista or Windows 7 then don't waste your hard earned money on this product.Edited 02/09/2009"
1,"Will not work with Vista or Windows 7, else would rate 4 stars","Back when I was using XP, this pad was great! But heck, even you ""Vista haters"" will upgrade when Windows 7 comes out, then it's just a piece of junk. The ErgoDex site has had the message that they are working on Vista drivers, and have a signup for beta testers. These pages of ""we're working on it"" have not changed since Vista came out. If you check their forum, they filter any bad feedback, so you will not see all the pleas I (and I'm sure others) have made to please support their customers.They are the most unresponsive company I have ever attempted to deal with. My only hope is that Windows 7 will be a big enough success that they will finally have to fix their stuff or go out of business.Ergodex, if you see this, fix your drivers and this one star moves to four... you'll never get a 5 as your company is too arogant to answer to the people that you expect to pay for your products."
1,bloodrayn 2,this movie sucked i liked the first one this one was bad all the way around bad story bad action bad actors i am glad i did not buy it new i would have been mad ana
3,not worth the price,Billy the kid being a vampire was just stupid. The plot sucked as well. Good acting and cinamatography but not worth the money I paid. Way overpriced.
5,good movie,i got both i and 2 when the blockbuster in my town was going out of business i like the both of them. They got slashing parts when i say slashing parts i mean people it has been a while that i have seen then but i like the movies.
1,Are you kidding,Look Truth is I'm a true BloodRayne die hard fan. She did carry a gun in the game but nothing like this six shooter she carries in this movie. Next the guys she fought Rayne would easily despense of these clowns.Next when ever she was weak she could easily feed on her enemies to regain her strength. As far as martial arts she didn't use any in this movie.THe first one was more entertaining than this even though they butchered it too. Furtehermore anyone who plays the game that she can't come near water it burns her skin instantly. i could go all day long about things they left out about her acrobatic abilities they should have included but it won't do this movie no justice. If you gonna do a movie about a game character at least geta a better depth look into the character damn!!!!
4,Blood Rayne 2,"Awesome movie, enjoyed the western theme very much,like the fact that they showed vampires in western times, good quality DVD"
2,Bloodrayne 2,"I only paid 3 bucks for this and that was still ""expensive"" in terms of how much this film is worth. Try 50 cents if anything. I fell asleep during the film but maybe I was just tired to begin with but then Bloodrayne 2 was boring. It is really rare for me to rate a movie low and more so to not enjoy it. If I had her weapons, I'd be using them non-stop and her she is only using them, if not just one of her blades for a very short time. It's mostly just shootings and some blood here and there. I didn't care for any of the characters or plot. Bloodrayne is a bad ass videogame and Rayne is mighty fine so it's sad when the films stink. I dunno why Uwe Boll sucks at directing and hasn't discovered it yet. I hope they remake Bloodrayne into the gory, nasty, sexy film it's suppose to be. I respect Uwe Boll for all his films and work but he really needs to try harder so he can make a movie that can earn more than a 2 star rating."
3,"full of info., but poorly put together","As someone interested in starting a vending business, I found that there is a huge lack of information about the business - the types of vending, the How's, Why's, the money, everything. Bill Way's book is just about the only good resource you can find, and it's only 'Okay' at best!This book is frustrating in that it's basic, while being too 'dense' to make sense. The pages are put together in the WORST example of graphical layout I've ever seen. You'll be reading, following a column down, and realize it no longer makes sense! Oh!, they jumped over to the NEXT column and continued!!Good as a re-reference book, but possibly a bit too expensive for what you get... the only reason I rate it so highly is because it's just about the only thing out there to get you started.Unfortunately, he also spends a lot of time in the book promoting his website...."
1,One big sales pitch--awful,"This book is horribly written and the author is doing nothing but promoting his company which SELLS vending machines. Give me a break. I want my $25 back. How can you believe anything he says, when all he is trying to do is sell you a machine the whole time? Don't waste your money on this book. It's awful."
5,Best book for teaching your child to read,I have launched two readers with this book and am currently working on a third. The book can be used initially to teach a child letter sounds and then launches into lists of three letter words that are similar. The book progresses to the point of making your child at least a level 3 reader. You can go at your own pace -- the back of the book has very helpful and extremely short description of skills being taught on each page for the parent. I highly recommend. I have tried at least 7 other reading programs-- this is the best in my opinion.
3,Pretty good,"This is my first razor, seeing that I am only thirteen. Shaves pretty well. Leaves no irritation on the skin. The color is great, the pink color adds more of a feminine touch to it. And now, you can use the venus divine cartridges for the regular venus. There are only to cons to this product:1. The handle is hard to grip, especially if your hand are wet and all of the soap/gel didn't wash off of your hands. Ideally, a larger grip would be better.2. I have cut myself before. Sure, thats just part of shaving. But the advertising says that it offers unbeatable protection. There are plenty of other razors out there that have better protection.Overall, you should only buy this product if you don't mind occasionaly nicking yourself and you don't care about the protection. This razor offers a close shave, no doubt about it."
5,a change,"i notice my urine color changed. it gotten extra brighter yellow while taking milk thistle, so im assuming that it is cleansing my liver considering that its what milk thistle does. i take 1 a day. 120 caps = 120 days"
4,"Finally, A Credible Dance Compilation!","I'm a big fan of Insider magazine, so I was anxious to receive their first music offering. I was surprised by its unique producer collective and diverse soundscape. I was pleased with Dj Lego's and Erick Morillo's remixes. This is definitely a keeper. I would recommend this mix to anyone who wants to listen to a genuine dance mix that's fillled with soon to be club anthems. Volume 2 will be on my Christmas wish list for sure."
4,A Gentle Gem,"This is a portrait of six months or so in the life of Wayne Weaver, an 18-year-old Amish boy. It relates his thoughts and lifestyle. As a picture of Amish life from his perspective, it is very interesting. Wayne has some doubts about his life, but his thinking is clarified by certain events. I believe the Amish are portrayed favorably, and I gained insight into their way of life. This book is simply told and thought provoking, and Wayne's essential goodness of character is attractive. I intend to read this book again."
2,Regretted buying,"Dificient contents as a paid computer based material. I was expecting this MWCD would be more full coverage dictionary rather than a thinny handdy reference. Lacking examples and ediums, it only offers short definitions of words which is not eye-catchingly displayed though by the way. Relatively easy install and access, yes I agree on that. But it did bump with my Windows ME and word 2000 several times and I needed to boot-up again once in a while. Slow pop up was another pain. You may want the definition boxs to come up in 2 seconds when you have COMPUTER DICTIONARY INSTALLED, not ten seconds chewing your finger and listening your hard drive deadly spinning. I also felt crooked that there are many free on-line dictionaries with comparable quality(actually I feel them better) including pronounceation. One virtue of this MWCD is it plays on and with word processing software. With a few mouse clickings, you can consult and find right on working paper."
3,"Mediocre, at best.....","Old-timers waiting for another Kansas ""classic"" to turn up-don't hold your breath! You won't find it with ""Somewhere to Elsewhere"". Gone are the melodic movements and brilliant arrangements as demonstrated on ""Song for America"" and ""Masque"". Instead Kansas, puts forth a ""tired"" sounding effort, void of the old intense musicianship. Kerry Livgren, the creative force behind Kansas needs to channel his energies ""elsewhere"". Forget this one, and remember Kansas in their glory- circa 1974-75......"
2,Original Kansas sound-Not even close,"When I heard that Kerry Livgren wrote this material and that it reminded him of the Kansas sound I was very excited. I have always been a huge fan of the original Kansas music. This cd is not even close. It pains me to say that most of the music is boring. The original Kansas sound takes me back to great songs like Song for America, Hopelessly Human, Closet Chronicles and Mysteries and Mayhem to name a few. I honestly don't understand how people can say in their reviews that this is the ""old Kansas sound."" One Kansas cd that I hardly ever hear mentioned that is worth buying is Freaks of Nature. I hate to be critical of Kansas because they will always be my favorite band but one must be true to the music."
3,EARTH TO KANSAS FANS....,"Ok folks.. After reading about 30 reviews, I was finally compelled to respond. In short, there are some great moments on this CD - definitely reminiscent of 'old' Kansas. And yes, Steve DOES sound the best he's sounded in well over 10 years. But the one thing I really missed was the classic soundscapes that Kansas were masters at. In the mid to late 70's, one didn't listen to Kansas albums and pick apart every single instrument. Instead, we were treated to one solid wall of sound made up of individual bricks laid by the members. On Somewhere To Elsewhere, the mix is so spacious that it fails to produce that wall of sound. Instead, what we have is a well produced demo. And that is the major part of the album that disappointed me. All in all, it's a good album. There ARE some good songs. But folks, PLEASE stop saying it's BETTER than Leftoverture. I think we all know better than that..Feel free to email me at freethinkernj@aol.com"
4,What a surprise!,"Being a Kansas fan since the debut album I had lost interest after college(1978) with the mediocrity of the songwriting. They had lost so much of their edge and had no new vision. Then I heard the original group had reformed and I thought""well just another dinosaur milking the oldies cash cow"". But I went to see Yes' Epic tour in Nashville and Kansas opened for them. Blown away! I saw them last in 1977 and they sounded every bit as tight and crisp as they did over 20 years ago. How good to have Steve Walsh back in top form and the band hitting on all cylinders. The played Icarus II and Not Man Big. Next day bought the cd. Do yourself a favor..you buy it too. If you love Kansas youll love this cd..albeit no Song for America on here. If you are a 90's neo progrogessive rock fan buy it and see one of the major influences of those bands youve been listening to. You wont be sorry!"
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed. The story was rushed with little plot. The art work was good, not great. I read the reviews and thought this would be a wonderful addition to my library, but I'll sell as soon as I can. Michael Manning or Parris Quinn as better options."
4,Steal Track #1?,"This is generally just an OK soundtrack - except for the 1st song ""Time Has Come Today"" by Sheryl Crow and Steve Earle which is just... phenomenal. Actually, IMHO, it is one of the great covers of all time and alone is worth the cost of the CD."
1,Save your money and use your user manual.,"This book is good for beginners I guess, and teaches you noting else but the basics. I think the manual that comes with your software gives you as much. A big let down. It should be named ""how to start with photoshop and nothing else."" It shows you couple of tricks at the end of the book but no explanations, tools used nor process but vage descriptions. Like that is a secret you'll find in a book named ""How to do Everything with photoshop CS2."" Save your money and just play with photoshop without this book. You'll speed you learning."
4,Highly Recomended,The story is very well written. It is amazing when you realize that it was written more than a hundred years ago.
2,Lord of the world,"This book was a little complicated to read.but managed to get through it.maybe other people will,have a better time reading this then imdid"
5,Omg that pillar is so random,Everyone should watch this at least twice. Absolutely hilarious and great performances abound. Educational and provocative in a dignified way
5,Love this show!,"This is a great show, and the DVD package added in some good bonus features. Now, I just can't wait for Angry Boys to start up."
5,Essential Viewing if You Are a Celtic Fan!,"Or if you are a fan of selfless play, super passing and true teamwork; I started becoming a fan of NBA basketball in the early 80's and so I was spoiled by the Lakers-Celtics rivalry and their unique brands of basketball. I still think the '86 Celtics are the best team ever and would have beaten the Lakers handily even if they had managed to get past the Rockets that year. They were a true team and were almost machine-like in the way they got the job done, methodically dissecting their opponents.And so, while us long-suffering Celtic fans wait for the next Larry Bird, we have this dvd set to keep us company and to remember where and how this team came about on 5 discs. As the game footage come from deteriorated master tapes, the visual quality isn't perfect but is still good enough to enjoy.Recommended."
3,good book....,"This book is really great. I learned things that I didnt know. And now I can interpret my dreams really easily. But i only have one negative comment about the book, and that is when i read the first part of the book (before the interpretations section) it wasnt that ""free flow"" reading as I thought I would be. But apart from that, it is a very useful book."
1,Disappointing; re-recordings not sounding as remembered!,"As the Feb. 2010 reviewer noted, these are simply re-recordings by the same artists, without the same original sound... close in some cases (as with ""Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye""), missing in most others. Don't buy this. Typical K-Tel!"
2,Not the best from these 3,"When you get anything from any of these 3 musicians, you would usually expect something worthy of your music collection. I was kinda dissapointed by this CD. I will buy a CD just for one track if it catches my ear. The rest usually take some time in getting some listening to appreciate. There is none of that on here. I have owned this cd for years now and have tried it on many times to see if there was something I wasn't hearing before...no luck. Sorry, but this only gets 2 stars from me and thats just because I find it hard to give these guys any less. There is just no focus here...get GHS3 instead."
2,very light in my opinion,"As always I continue to look out for the newest stuff that these guys put out. This particular recording to me is simply boring and uneventful. A couple tunes are worthy but the rest is complete mush. I love Steve Smith to death but his bland plain drum tone is almost the same on all these newer recordings. Take a listen to the ""Players"" disc or Vitals ""global beat"" . Much warmer and fuller tone. Live its a different story. But im not impressed with the recordings that are being done at his home studio. If this was the first disc you heard by any of these guys, you might not ever buy one from them again."
1,namco guncon 2,It doesnt work-you can hear the gun shoot but there are no crosshairs. very disappointed.
4,Dogstar happy ending - A Pleasant Suprise,"Although I am seldom drawn in by celebrity hype, I admit that I bought bought this CD because of that and my curiousity.I continue to listen to it because it is good. Glad I took the time~"
4,Alarming surprise,"Happy Ending reflects the emergence of maturity and a sense of cohesion between band members. A lack of pretense found in the lyrics upholds an easy flow that allows the music to pulse and the insightfulness to pour. The lead off Halo rolls easily. Radio darling Cornerstone and Superstar anchor the middle tracks. Brett Dombrose's smooth voice carries Washington, a gorgeous idea. The last three songs truly accentuate the kind of music Dogstar is capable of creating should they decide to really let it go. The hypnotic guitar playing and sexy theme of Alarming will truly blow you away."
4,Dogstar Shines with Happy Ending,"As an avid fan of R&B and Jazz, I was pleasantly surprised by Dogstar's solid musicianship. These guys are very good! Brett Domrose's soulful lyrics are backed by the strong rhythmic stylings of Robert Mailhoue & Keanu Reeves, and combined they produce a musical offering which is powerful in it's simplicity.I'll be honest - I heard all the jokes and snide comments about 'vanity bands' and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, this band's quality speaks for itself. I was not disappointed. The work stands up great as a whole but I found 'Cornerstore' to be an exceptional ballad and I caught myself humming Halo after the first listening. The fact that their cover of 'Superstar' is excellent has been mentioned more than once so I'll just add my accolades to the others.There's a reason why the Dogstar shines brightest in the night sky."
2,This is an apocolpyse??,"I think Fulci put that in the title (or however it translates to in Italian) to capitalize on his yet as unrealized desire to create superb horror. Westerns were not his forte' There is some violence, but it goes out of it's way to be gratuitous. There is an annoying song that is used throughout half of the movie. There is a kickass villian who sould've gotten more screen time. And there is loads of Fulcian nilhism that both the story and this view could've done without."
2,Very disappointing,"Owing to the fact that i am a huge Fulci fan i was very excited about seeing Four of the apocalypse. I have enjoyed a wide spectrum of his movies including the beyond, conquest, house by the cemetary, city of the living dead, new york ripper, contraband, lizard in a womans skin, dont torture a duckling etc etc.Unfortunately with four of the apocalypse,i was very disappointed. The acting is good and im a fan of Fabio Testi but the pace is slow and plodding, the soundtrack awful and there is very little of Fulcis signature violence to speak of !Worth a look but for Fulci completists only, I would certainly recommend renting this first before you buy it !"
1,Missing Cartridge,"When I received this product, the back was opened and one of the cartridges was gone. I am shocked by such outrageous act of dishonesty."
1,"Not Sharp, blades went dull quick.","Funny because I had a mach 3 for a long time, and I love it to death.I decided to go ahead and try the new razor. I bought this from Walmart. Very strange, indeed. This has never happened before. Is the Mach 3 supposed to be dull for a faster shape? maybe they used dull blades so people can shave fast without cuts? Or I just got a bad package.I decided to go ahead and do this review for amazon because I saw there were a lot of reports of dull blades upon purchase. I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real. It seems possible that Gillette may be letting go of some of their quality.Sorry all but the blades suck. Just because you didn't think so, doesn't mean mine weren't dull. This is a crappy A razor. You can go you know what."
4,good story about an intriguing character,"A historical novel which sends the reader off in other directions to find even more information about the characters is well worth reading - and such is the case with Duncker's latest effort. James Miranda Barry is certainly one of the more curious figures of mid-19th century English life, and discovering why ""he"" became what he became makes for a very enjoyable read. The supporting characters (some actual persons, others creations of the author) are well-drawn and add further color to the story of the enigmatic doctor. The author does a fine job in presenting the contradictions and confinements under which women lived during this time as well as presenting the issue of slavery as an institution which bound more than those who were officially enslaved. I would recommend this book to any who are taken up by well-written historical novels with unusual twists."
4,The South,As a guy born in Arkansas in the 30s this book was a terrific look at life as I knew it in the south. I think it is a lovely read for either nostalgia or information or both. I recommend it to anyone interested in the reality of the real south.
3,"Not bad, but didn't live up to my hopes","One of Nancy Farmer's previous novels, ""The Ear, The Eye & The Arm,"" is on my all time favorite books list, and this is the first of her other books I decided to read, so maybe I got my hopes up too high. Compared with the unbelievably thoughtful, funny, engaging characters, setting and plot of her previous book, I found this one a bit dull. I found most of the characters to be a bit lacking in personality, and I had to force myself to keep reading, because any minute now the plot might become actually compelling. It never really did. That said, however, ""The Sea of Trolls"" is not actually a bad book, just sort of forgettable."
1,"Average Book & Too Long, Disappointed","Unlike most of the reviewers I found this book on the boring side. I think it could have been half the length, too. A lot of it was unnecessary and should have been edited better. I enjoyed The House Of Scorpion, but not this one. This book was average, nothing special and written with a lot of passive voice. It wasn't unique. It read like many other similar books."
5,The sea of trolls is awesome!,"the sea of trolls is my favorite book in the world!!! The book is writen in a way that it feels like your living the novel, that you are part of it. It is adventurous, but unlike other books, it is not centerd on the adventure in a way that the rest is empty. There is a full story behind what is happening so you know the past too. I have read the book four times and it still doesn't get boring, that's how good a book it is."
3,Backpack,"Seems to be well constructed; however, not as big as I would have liked for a book bag for school"
1,"Great idea, didn't work for us & wouldn't recommend","This product is hard to get a reading. The child cannot be fussing at all and it takes about 10 seconds to get a reading. During that 10 seconds, the child has to be completely still and quiet - very difficult. It read as yellow (2 out of 5) on my 8 month old and she had a very serious ear infection. It read green (1 out of 5) on my older daughter when she also had an ear infection which kept me from taking her to the doctor and her ear drum ruptured. I would not recommend this product. Good old parental instinct is much better."
2,This must be an early effort.,"The cop had his moments, but on the whole the characters were not very well drawn, and the manner in which they interrelated were slapdash. Maybe it was just typical of the disco era in which this book was written, but I thought the dialogue was atrocious. The puzzle was not all that compelling, and the author's political overtones seemed both simplistic and schizophrenic.Final verdict: a poor attempt at mystery fiction."
3,Not Thomson's Best,"Thomson essays the question, 'What is an actor?', using Brando as a template. This book is only a biography in passing. Thomson argues against identifying actors with their parts, or treating them as the accumualted amalgamations of their roles. The cult worship of Brando, especially among the sensitive and intelligent, provides Thomson with a poignant model. Yet this is often a frustrating read. Thomson's argument is diffused by the book's chronological structure, while the details of Brando's biography serve a hypothesis rather than an accurate portrait of the man. He treats Brando as a text to be analysed, hence his use of present tense in describing Brando's history and the lack of interest he takes in the last thirty years of the man's life.An incisive but one-dimensional portrait."
5,this book is sooooo good!,"I am fifteen. And I just happened to pick this book up when I saw the front cover and read the title. It was really good. The horror and action was magnificent. Sometimes, people who read Stine books for a long time think that they know who the killer is going to be........... this time you wont. you will aboslutely NEVER EVER guess who the killer is unless you finish reading the book. And when you do find out who it is, you will just die in shock and amazement. It is sooooo good and it's definitely a page turner. READ READ READ THIS BOOK!"
4,the current Deep Purple guitar player with his solo album,"Mr Morse (DIXIE DREGS and KANSAS) is a typical high professional guitar hero. This album represented his solo work, his technique by picking guitar is excellent and a lot of beautifull ballads. That's the reason, why DEEP PURPLE /heavy rock Dinosaurus asked him to join them to replace the old Guitar veteran Ricthie Blackmore. Because they know that MR MORSE is the only one guy who replaced The old veteran Ritchie Blackmore. If you love Deep Purple, surely you will love MR MORSE solo album too."
2,Mixing and engineering is mushy,The album may have been good except for the mushy mix -- sort of like sound trying to go through water. It is amazing how important the engineering can be. The tracks fail to jump off the CD -- not crisp at all. I was disappointed. Sorry.
5,"Monster, volcanoes, death, love, regeneration",This would make a great movie. Mt. St. Helen's volcano will never be another eruption due seismic forces. Whalen writes scary books with heart rendering characters. For more information about this author (a lot more) e mail me. Joan (rjhue@bossig.com)
5,The Best Soundtrack Ever,"This soundtrack is the best soundtrack you will ever listen to. After watching the movie I felt that I had 2 listen to the soundtrack. Because I play the cello this music was very enjoyable for me. Some of these tracks were so good that i got the chills. ""Whisper of a Thrill"" is yet my favorite song on the cd i listened to it and began to cry because something about it made me feel sooo happy yet a little freaked out. Anyways the cd is great I listen to it when i go to bed and when I'm cleaning it's something that anyone can enjoy even if they dont like classical music."
5,Music for the soul,"Listen to the words, and listen to the sound of Kate Markowitz's powerful voice. A career session and back up vocalist to the superstars, Kate Markowitz captivated me with her depth and sound. THe music has a nice rhythm, one that she says was influenced by the Brazilian music she listened to as a kid, as well as the R & B, Motown and the performers she accompanied, including James Taylor and Shawn Colvin. I cried when I listened to I Remember You, a tribute to her late parents and to the late JT band member and friend, Don Grolnick. It is about life, loss and learning. And it is about romance. The last song, Who Needs the Spring, was written by her parents to each other. It is better than comfort food for the soul. I love Kate's music!"
4,Romantic after 20 years!,Their love story is a journey through hardship to rise at the mountain top. This CD is a culmination of these struggles that built a love that no earthquake can move.
4,A good basic overview of the German Cuckoo Clocks.,"Offers the industry's history (including machinery), many tips about the adjustment and restoration of these clocks, tools needed, etc. Photos of unusual clocks and the factories. A ""must have"" for those interested in, or repairing, the German Cuckoo Clocks."
2,Video Quality,The original release had 4 episodes per disk and the video quality was appalling. This new release will have 5 episodes per disk. I doubt the video quality will anything but worse. Maybe the studio re-mastered them to improve the quality but I doubt that. Also the studio's website lists the retail at $19.98 so why is Amazon charging $24.98?
3,"Great to have Xena on DVD, BUT...","It's wonderful to finally have Xena on DVD! But, having said that, there are several drawbacks to this release. The grain on the transfer is at times atrocious; like looking at a movie through your front porch screen door. There are also no subtitles or closed captioning - funny, since at least the broadcasts were closed captioned. I have friends who use this feature a lot for hearing issues and missed or difficult to understand dialogue - with a DVD release, you'd think they'd include at least ONE of these options. And finally, the extra computer DVD with photos, trivia, mythology, etc. was really nice, but would have been a lot better if the disk had been usable in a regular DVD player. I really enjoy having the episodes on DVD, but with a little more effort this would have been a far better release that what was published."
3,zena 1,Wow. I started watching this dvd not being already a zena fan. Some how I didn't remember the show being so cheezy. I think it gets better before it gets corrupted
3,Grainy,"Each episode of Xena: Warrior Princess is presented in its original 4:3 broadcast aspect ratio, and the source material is shockingly grainy.Every once in a while (mostly during bright outdoor shots) the film grain rears its ugly head in a major way. Maybe it's an aesthetic decision, or just poor film stock, but regardless its annoying. Aside from the grain, the source material is in good shape with little real defects or other anomalies. Colors are fairly well-saturated if not particularly impressive, but black levels fluctuate too much for a show that is still relatively recent, with indoor scenes looking good but much of the outdoor sequences suffering from a washed-out look. Detail is thus only is fair and shadow delineation wanting. There are no examples of compression artifacting to speak of, but this is still not a set of transfers worthy of a warrior princess. The show is great but the video on this dvd that was remastered by Anchor bay is why I gave this set 3 stars"
3,Its what it is.,"I thought I was ordering a bigger can. It worked well for what I needed in any case. Could have bought the same thing in bigger size for what I paid with shipping, etc. Dont think I will be ordering stuff like this again, due to the cost."
1,The Punisher 2004 WAS THE BEST YET!!!,"This Movie was absolute TRASH!!! I liked the idea of having Dolph Lundgren as the Puniser and Louis Gossett Jr. was great in this movie like any other. The story was lamb, the punisher didn't even have the skull shirt!!! HOW GAY!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED. I'm a major Punisher FAN! Don't waste your time on this version. THE THOMAS JANE version is the BEST!!! Please...if you have this version of the movie, before you watch it...wipe your ass with it and burn it!!!!"
1,Punisher fan says this SUCKETH,"This stinker pretty much went straight to video. It's lame, has no plot, and makes a mockery of the Punisher. Where's his sidekick? Why are they preaching that it's wrong to kill murderous gangsters? I had to write a quick review just to bring the average stars down. This DVD should get the coaster of the Millenium award."
5,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!! TO HELL WITH THE NEW PUNISHER.. DOLPH DID A GREAT JOB IN THIS.. PLUS ITS ACTION PACKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH
1,Disgrace to the real Frank Castle,This movie was a disgrace. If you are a hardcore Punisher fan like I am you will hate this movie to the end. IT doesn't follow the comic in any way at all. I know very well that you would not have to worry about making the Punisher movie it was action pack and had a good plot. After they changed of course see what happened. They got a B rated movie that is stink up Frank Castle's name and the rest of Marvel with it.
5,Super Thanks For Asking!!,"My whole life on this world i have been subjected to bad movies. I mean i have seen some really bad movies from tombstone to jay and silentbob strike back, but this movie right here was a breath of fresh air. This movie's story line was on point with the comic unlike pieces of crap comic turned movies like the first batman and the tobey magayier spiderman movie. For $3 you cant beat that at all. i bought 20 one for my grandma who broke her hip, one for my cousin in toronto because you know canadains have no good movie sense, one for my mom because she thinks dolf is an underrated actor, and the other 17 are for my personal use because i found out with good movies people dont tend to return them once barrowed. So get some copies its a great movie."
3,Too common,"Everyone knows that this movie is based on the comic book character by the same name. But it doesn't seem like it when watching. Every element that made Punisher so unique on the comic book pages is gone. The character has simply been turned into just another maniac with a big gun. Although filled with good action scenes, comic book fans are advised to skip this one."
1,"Bad news, bad service","I bought the AR230 thinking it was a trustworthy brand name at a reasonable price. The unit I received would not play commercial DVDs or record on blank the DVD+Rs I bought or on the DVD+RW that came with it. Gatway told me to throw away the DVD+RW supplied and upgrade the firmware by downloading a file from their website. I told them I had a Mac, and they said no problem. Well it does! You have to have a Windows XP or Windows 98 SE machine to download upgrades. I had to find a friend with one of those operating systems and that was not easy.I downloaded the upgrade and loaded file into the Unit. It loaded fine, but it still would not play or record. Gateway promised a replacement would arrive in one week. It never arrived. On my fifth call to them to fix the problem, they told me it would take another two weeks because they were out of stock. Over a month has passed and now I have to wait another ten days for the return authorization.Bad product and even worse service."
1,Gateway AR230,"I bought this from QVC in 2004 and paid $249 I tried copying my home movies from VHS onto DVDs and I couldn't get more than 1/4 of a 6 hr VHS tape onto a disc. Within a month the machine didn't work. The eject didn't work unless you unplugged the machine and plugged it back in again. I sent it back and was sent a new machine. This one worked for a while and now it won't play any discs. At first it would freeze for a second and then continue. Then it started to freeze and stay frozen. Now once I click on play it freeezes and won't play anything. I have been trying to get tech help from the Gateway site, but it brings me in circles and I cannot seem to get anyone on either chat or email. I guess this is going into the trash."
1,Breaks Down,"We bought a Gateway AR230 a year ago. It worked great for 3 months, then would not format anything, or read anything it had recorded. We called Gateway and sent it back. We were sent a new one, and it worked for 8 months before the same thing happened. Our warranty has now expired, and we will definitely be buying another brand."
4,The Rugrats are so cute!,"The Soundtrack is cute too! The songs and lyrics are clean and sweet and safe. Not like most music today. You get a variety of music! It's a nice soundtrack! All the songs describe the Rugrats well! I think there is a line between cute and annoying, it's not a CD that would always be playing in my stereo, but I think that it is a fun album!"
4,All people who critize this game suck,"I want to get one thing straight. This game does not copy Yu-gi-oh. It is in no way like Yu-gi-oh. Those who say it is like Yu-gi-oh are imbeciles. They are wrong. This game can get tedious, yet calling it like Yu-gi-oh is too much of an insult."
3,Fun but way too repetitive.,"Fun game for the gameboy. It's an RPG hack and slash. There is a card system that is pretty cool but you'll find annoying later on in the game. You need moogle points to get any ""good"" cards. Once you hit the second world set you'll find that you need to hit up the moogle store a lot. The game play is fun but gets old quick. After you complete 1/4 of the game you'll more than likely want to stop playing for a while. The game follows a pattern along the lines of; synth world, kill monsters, synth room, kill monster, fight boss, rinse, and repeat.Unless you're into the series I wouldn't recommend buying it. Your best bet is to rent the game because it's pretty much useless once you finish it. The constant repetition in this games take the replay value out of it."
5,Coolness,First of all i would lik 2 say WHAT A GREAT GAME!!!!! seriously it is a great game. the new card based system is pretty much good after u get used 2 it which takes lik 5 mins of the game. it also has over 24 (only sora s side) hours of gameplay and the graphics r excellent. the unknowns in the game r cool and the best part of the game the tension keeps rising and rising so ull love it. and riku is avalable wen u beat sora s side and his gam play hours r lik 10-16 hours and he jumps higher and can go into...o heck just buy the gam and find out.
2,Not as good as it seems...,"This game seems like it has it all, especially because of all of the rave reviews and good graphics, but all the stages seem the same. The card system is REALLY bad. This game is not anything. The only hard part is the bosses, which take forever to beat. They are the only thing that brings lenghth to the game. I played kingdom hearts for PS2, and it was so superior. I usually write positive things about games, and when I write a boo review I often include positive things. Here they are:Pretty good graphics, but don't be fooled.That is it. Please, consider this before buying the game."
2,this sucks,this game sucks and its only good if your a kingdom hearts fan(or a live action tcg style fan?) overall this fills a couple story gaps that arent that important but if you want this game and you also want kingdom hearts 2 wait for kingdom hearts 2: final mix it has chain of memories AND a bunch of other cool things
5,I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS,I cannot wait for this game to come out! KH was the greatest game and Ive been anticipating this games arrival forever! As soon as I beat KH i was looking to see when another was coming out! Im so glad that Its so soon! This was my first RPG ever and i absolutley fell in love with it! Happy playing!
1,A Repugnant Film,"A one-sided hagiography of a failed president who slanders an American Ally (Israel) for trying to protect itself from Palestinian terror bombers. In this film, Carter is self-pitying, unctous and surrounded by sycophants--he wears his piety on his sleeve.Apparently, the man has no sense of shame--even after contributing (as President) to runaway hyperinflation, endless unemployment, gasoline lines, Iranian hostages, ""malaise"", and a ""giant rabbit"" which unfortunately missed its target. And now the Dorkus is once again singing the praises of Hamas. OK--the man can build houses . But he weakened this country tremendously. He was a disgrace as a leader and was soundly defeated in a landslide election after only 1 term.More recently, he said on PBS that no senator or congressman, ""Could ever vote against an issue favored by the Israeli lobby."" And he said this with a mean, goofy, sarcastic smirk. You'll learn nothing from this film which is to be avoided!!"
5,An excellent way to learn or review,"I was wary at first of buying this because of only one sketchy amazon review.Aside from the cheesy country music that plays during the lessons every now and then, this is an excellent program that makes complex topics in united states history very simple. I wish they had this for every school subject. The quizzes with 100 multiple choice questions per disc (6 discs in all) are great review, and the questions are very SAT II-like.One warning though, you won't find every single topic in u.s. history. This software only culls the most prevalent topics in high school courses.The old-ness of this program and its interface make this and its ancillaries (dictionary+encyclopedia) very easy to use. All you have to do is plug and play."
5,You'll laugh and cry and hope there's a sequel,"Sandi Kahn Shelton knows how to create characters that amuse and intrigue. You'll find yourself relating to Maz's struggles and the ""if you don't laugh you'll cry"" that helps her get through them all. It's a great first novel."
1,I couldn't even finish it,"Maybe I'm not a true chick-lit connoisseur even though I generally can't get enough Keyes or Crusie, but I couldn't even get past Chapter 3 of this book. And I have to say I pride myself on finishing every book I start. However, this story line made me so sad and uncomfortable for the main character, Maz, I couldn't read another word. I won't speak for the entire book, because there may be some miracle that occurs later in the book that makes it palatable, but I guess all I can recommend is if you're going to try it out, at least power through to Chapter 4. Perhaps, I was just too impatient."
3,Crazy comes after crazy,"Good book, could have used a stronger ending ( possibly because the author is a nicer person than me).Fun to read"
2,Confusion,I needed to purchase a 512 MB DIMM for my Dell notebook. Either I misread the offering or they shipped me 2 256 MB DIMMs instead. No doubt the memory worked because I have never had a bad memory from Kingston in the past. I didn't try these because it was not what I wanted and generally you cannot return opened memory packages.I gave this transaction a 2 because I'm not sure whose fault it was but I still had to pay shipping for the return.
4,"cool games, bad case","games are cool but the case is rather cheaply made, all of the decorations glued to it have since popped off. Games included are nice though. I'd still buy it again though - the kids love the bingo."
1,Enough Is Enough Already!,Once again we have studio releasing a piece meal DVD while in the middle of releasing seasons. Why bother buying a single DVD with a few episodes while you can get the whole season for a little more.As for the length of the time before complete season release. All I can say is they better wise up. Every month they make me wait just lets me wonder whether I want to spend $500 on all the seasons over time...
1,Why?,"Why release random sets of some of the more mediocre (relatively speaking) episodes?Why not do a ""Fan Favorites"" DVD, with the most popular episodes according to fans or something like that?Poor choices for a theme, and while the episodes are funny and watchable, there are so many better ones around.1 star."
1,ENOUGH WITH THESE RANDOM TEASERS,"NOTE TO FOX - We are tired of your gouging The Simpsons fans by piece mealing these lousy single DVDs in order to make more money. Just release the box sets without the comentaries. Then release another version of the box sets with the commentaries for those who think it's worth the years of waiting. I have listened to some of them and half the time, the creators drift off into subjects not related to the episode. Why would I want to listen to that?"

2,Not very good,"The 1976 version Helter Skelter was far superior. This version felt thin and not as well researched. The courtroom scenes were really poor and not historically accurate, at least from what I read. Even some of the names were different. Just not a good account of what really happened."
5,Great floor lamp,"Buying a floor lamp by Internet is a bit odd. This new model by Sylvania is well worth it! Not only is it attractive looking, easy to assemble, and ""cool"" to the touch, it illuminates the reading field very well and at a great distance. I can adjust it to serve as a reading lamp for the other end of the couch - about 9 feet away."
5,All-Time Greatest,"It doesn't matter what mood I am, it seems like I can listen to this tape (yes I still have it on tape...haven't graduated to CD yet). Mike Ness is such a hottie!"
5,"Great Album,Must Have for your CD Collection.","From So Far Away-Drug Train, every song is great. Once you listen to this CD the songs stay in your head all day. This is by far the best Social D studio album out there. Live at the Roxy is the best Social D CD,and Mike Ness Cheating at Solitaire is the best CD I own. I over 300 cd.P.S Dennis keep jamming at that gig in the sky."
5,One of the best discs of all time....,"Having listened to 'punk' for the past 20 years or so, I can say that I've been around long enough to say that there are some bands that just rock. Social Distortion is one of those bands. This is one of those records that, no matter what, can be counted on to rock. Whether you want to call it punk or rockabilly or cowpunk or whatever. These guys are great. Along with the classics Mommy's Little Monster and Prison Bound, this disk stands the test of time. I have this on LP, tape AND CD. And if you ever get the chance, see them live!! I haven't seen them since the early 90's, but what you hear on the CD is what you hear live. And they play forever (hours, well worth the price of admission). This was probably one of their best tours. Stop reading, buy the CD already."
5,I couldn't put the book down!!!!!,"After finally receiving this book, I found myself reading it hour after hour!! Reading this book has helped me in so many ways. The things she talks about is just what it is like. I was an escort for 4 years and should know!! She made it out and so I have. So I encourage anyone who is struggling with this so called lifestyle to get it RIGHT NOW!!!!!"
5,No Way Out,What an overwhelming tale of a young woman's struggle to find a loving caring place to grow up and finding none turning to the oldest trade in history. I found her story fascinating and yet terribly upsetting that this was the fate of a young woman in her first exposure to the outside world.
4,Worth Reading,All too often one is exposed to the glamour of the life of a diplomat. This book is an insightful look into the work-a-day world of an American diplomat. Well worth the read.
2,Okay but not High Quality,"Summary - Poor acting kills a classicDetail - As a fan of TinTin since I was a boy, I expected more. Although the DVD follows the story line more closely than the new movie, and the animation is very much like the book, the detractors outweigh the entertainment value. Sadly, the quality of the animation is average and the voice acting poor. My children, who generally are tolerant of most of my trips down memory lane and also fans of the boy reporter, disliked it so much they left the room and told me they would rather watch nothing then put up with the acting in this show.Recommendation - In the end, even through rose-colored glasses of a fan, the best I can say is this is okay to poor. I am disappointed and do not recommend this disc."
4,Tin Tin Season 1,A great addition to my movie collection. I used to watch this series when I was a kid and enjoyed it then and now. four stars because it would have been nice to have some extras about Herge on the DVD.
1,Fast Way Off Of The Charts,"That was the worse cashmoney cd to come out ever. Everything sucked from the beats, to the lyrics. I think he should have promoted the three that left. That cd will not crack the top 2o on the billborad charts."
4,"Pretty good, but not what I expected.","This is a high quality product--it never flakes up, and holds a lot better than most *extra hold* products do. Though it does hold well, it's not what I expected. I probably had unrealistic expectations based on what a couple people told me about this product. It's a very good gel for men, has a very masculine smell to it. Luckily, that smell diminishes when you blow-dry it. But it's not for the ultimate mohawk or similar styles.Got 2b Glued Styling Spiking Glue 6 fl oz (170 g)holds better but has the chance of flaking up. So which is better is determined by which you prefer--high quality smooth stuff that holds pretty good..or good quality stuff that holds very well that might like you look like you needHead & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo, Ocean Lift, 23.7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)"
4,great,"A great product if you don't want your hair to get crunchy when styling and holds for a long time. However, this stuff doesn't come out as easily as you might think when washing your hair and can get flakey/white if someone really rubs your head."
3,Let Down By Poor Sound,"Whatever people think of this individual reading (I happen to like most of it) the recording has always let it down. When originally issued it was very bright and harsh up top while extremely light in the bass. Some balances were also a little odd (up front cymbals and a nearly non-existent rute in the third movement, but this may have been Rattle's hand). It made for extremely uncomfortable listening.Remastering has slightly softened the top end and added a marginal amount of depth but it can't put in what was never there to begin with -- bass frequencies. This sound picture seems to have been a trait of many Mike Sheady engineered recordings. A simple comparison with many Mahler 2's and even Rattle's own beautifully recorded Mahler 3 show the stark difference."
5,child hood,i grew up on these cartoons and thats when cartoons were good. the wild thornberrys rock and its a good buy. if you have kids or are just a big kid like me the get it
4,How a shy boy is able to use his talents.,"This is a short book for children about a young boy in a Japanese village who is very shy, quiet, and is kidded by his classmates for being different. The book was a 1956 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for children. Children always seem to love this story. Perhaps because many feel shy at times themselves.Interestingly, I believe that this is the first Caldecott Honor book (as far as I can tell) appearing after the end of World War II depicting a Japanese character. As such, it may have also helped to heal some old wounds from that war. It shows how similar children can be from another culture."
2,DVD Guide to the Citizenship Test & Interview,The actual DVD was of poor quality so I couldn't even watch the program.
3,"Fun music, especially for a party featuring tequila","I don't know if I would have ever bought a Billy Bacon CD if I hadn't seen them in concert. It's not very sophisticated music, but it sure is fun, and funny. More fun live than you can imagine until you've experienced them. I first heard them on vacation in the Clearwater Beach area, and I ended up buying a number of their CDs to relive that night, but this remains their best CD. I used to work at a restaurant called the ""Texas Star Fajita Bar,"" and we played it frequently there, though it got on the bartender's nerves. It's Spanglish, Tex-mex-gringo inspired, cerveza-drinking party music, nothing more, nothing less. Play this at your next Cinqo-de-Mayo party, and make sure your guests go home in cabs, not driving."
2,"grainy quality, very slow drying time.","I was terribly disappointed in this product which I bought for use in my Canon Pixma iP6000D printer. The image is grainy and, if you touch the photo within 5 minutes, you will leave marks. I laid anothe picture on top of one done 5 minutes earlier, and they stuck together. I have had very good luck with Canon paper."
4,open mind see different opionion,"This book was published in 1999, it predicted something happened today. 10 years ago, I tried to collect books and later sell books on amazon, I did not continue to sell books until 2005. Instead occasionaly, I start to read some books in my garrage. Now it is June, 2009, it is funny to read this book too late personaly. Anyway, congratulation to the Author Larry Burkett, you are not forgotten."
3,Its ok,"I wanted a better movie editing program. I was using Micrsoft Movie Maker.Its ok. Its alittle hard to get use to. It's not easy to just open it and get started you need to really read the book and figure out the program. I still use Microsoft Movie maker to edit and put captions to my movies than I go to Ulead to make it a DVD. So thats all I use it for now. I have had it for several months and I keep atempting to use it, but get just to fustrated with the program."
5,My 16 m/o LOVES this!!!!,"My daughter got this kitchen set for her 1st birthday. We kept it in the box, storing it in the closet, thinking she wasn't &amp;amp;quot;ready&amp;amp;quot; for it. Now that she's 16 months, we decided to take it out and see if she likes it...she LOVES it!!!! We keep it in our basement (faimly room), and whenever she sees it, she squeals and runs right over to play with it. The size is PERFECT, and it has enough features (doors, knobs, hooks, pull out trays, etc...) to keep my daughter interested. I love (and so does she!) how she can walk around it - it has a stove on one side and a refrigerator on the other. It was quick and easy to assemble and is extremely durable! What an AWESOME gift!!!! It is something that she can play with now, but also enjoy for a few more years."
4,"Good quality, great value","We bought this kitchen for our 3 year old son. He doesn't play with it too much unless we participate, but once he is at it, he enjoys fixing fries, coffee and hotdogs for us.Pros:- basic colors that suits both boys and girls.- It comes with some food and cups, plates, silverware...- Easy to assemble.- Good plastic quality.- Lots of features in a small place: oven, fridge, sink, ""cupboard"", 2 burners that makes boiling/ frying sounds...- Way cheaper than the bigger ones.- It has wheels to move it from one place to another.Cons:- A little bit unstable; if your child leans on the side trays, it will fall down.- As it has the fridge in one side and the oven at the other, your child will only be able to use one of them if you decide to lean the kitchen against a wall to avoid the knock down."
4,"Fantastic pretend play toy, but may have durability issues","I purchased this for my 2 year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it. I purchased an additional set of play food, although she seemed to be perfectly happy with the food that came with the set. There are a couple of things I'd point out. The oven door, does not stay shut and the top comes off every time I try to lift it. Still very happy with it though. I would warn those folks with shorter toddlers that the top is used to store the plates, etc. and it can fall over if pulled (it's very light)."
2,DIdn't really care for this one...,"The songs just seem too slow and funeral-dirgish. I do own Odelay! and enjoy it, but this just makes me want to sleep.If I had to pick a ""favorite"" (Which is stretching it) ""O Maria"" would probably be it.I was surprised there weren't more negative reviews (one-star)....until I read them: they all seem to be written by the same person. So obviously SOMEONE out there likes it."
4,Excellent CD from talented songwriter,"Beck is starting to show his true potential in this CD as he starts to write, sing and compose a terrific blend of rock, country-western and blues styles. The songs are intelligently performed, with lots of character and feeling. You won't be disappointed."
5,Beck is a remarkable artist.,"Here's a puzzler: if Geffen releases a Beck album but does little to promote it is it still a Beck album? Afraid that this departure from Dust Brothers-produced collage sound of the best-selling Odelay might confuse and disappoint fans of Beck's most immediate previous work, the label has quietly released Mutations, treating it as a beck album--It's got his name on the cover--but not a ""Beck"" album. It's a testament to the inherent wierdness of conservative 90's marketing that an artist who found breakthrough with something radically different would be treated with distrust when trying to follow with something that doesn't match the sound of before. A beck album, and an excellent one at that Mutations draws from many far-reaching influences, just without samples and elaborate studio construction. He's either the ideal end-of-the-millennium artist, or the first important rock star of the next."
5,Beck..surfing the oceans of velveeta americana once again..!,Beck is Beck is Beck -- long after the fair weather radio goo-goos have tossed aside a dusty Odelay....the beck will still be drifting in his hazy languid reprose and dousing america in a cheese-wiz jet engine reflection of our own national spew.... yeahhhhh Beck!
2,Lyrics are real depressing,"What is with these lyrics anyway? Death, decay, decadence, flies, and other wonderful subjects. I get the feeling that Beck is just writing this stuff to get attention. Hey, we can't write positive songs and keep that ""edge,"" now, can we? So let's throw in a few grotesque, risque, and/or disturbing lyrics. That'll make the kids stand up and take notice!Typical '90s calculated logic."
2,Beck's answer to Enya.,"There's something about this album that really nauseates me. I start listening to a song and my mind goes on auto-pilot or something. The trax just don't hold your interest. Is blase a good choice of wording? I guess what i really want Beck to do is make a whole entire album of ""Beercan"" (considering that song is tha bomb Beck track). The only song that stands out on ""Mutations"" is ""Tropicalia""? I think I like Beck's ""fun"" side rather than the somber/serious Beck. What I might do is use Mutations as a ""play while your falling asleep album"", right along side enya and b-tribe. Yeah, that's what i'll do................................THANKS!"
4,mutate into something else....,"The best collection of songs from one of rock's most intersting artists: this is just plain good music - for a counterpoint, see Beck's predictably hip-hoppable and cringe-worthy ""Midnite Vultures"" release. It's amazing that these works were created by the same artist; if you are more into ""shaking your booty"" than listening to interesting verse, pick up midnight vultures... if you are into interesting and complex musical and lyrical tapestries, get Mutations. His best work , earning equal marks alongside One Foot in the Grave and Stereopathetic Soul manure. You can't go wrong with this one."
4,Beck Folk,"Beck has shown his talent in many of his albums before this one, but this album introduced him to pop culture. It gave him the popularity he deserved for so long. If you started on Beck through his newest album, Sea Change, then you will very much enjoy this album as well. It shows his talent in Folk music. He has offered many different music variations, all coming from folk. He has clashed folk with some hip-hop and also with techno and even heavy metal. Beck is one of the great musicians of the last decade in his varies musical capabilities. So go out and buy this album and i also recomend mellow gold and the flaming lips 'soft bulletin'"
5,Beck! has always been the best at this!!!!!!!!!!!,"I recall him mentioning this CD won't be that commercially successfull like Mellow Gold or Odelay! . I think the sound of guitar, electronic samples, lyrics and his unique voice fit well each other. I am convinced there is always something original in music BECK! is doing."
1,Unlimited Blah,This CD contains NO Donna Summer vocals! ... which is apparent from the first note. Second-rate studio musicians create a 10-minute medley of Summer's classic tunes that is slightly interesting but worth no more than one or two listens.
1,"A lame effort, a waste of time and money!","This isn't the real Diva singing. At its best, it's ten minutes of glorified aerobics music."
1,"Useless, stupid",Anyone who is reading me is able to adapt to technology. Do we need a stupid book to tell us so?
5,Friends for life,"We bought two of these as possible replacements for our son's beloved first stuffed puppy. We purchased them in the fall of 2007 hoping to rotate them, but he discovered here were two. So, both of them have become an every day part of our lives.Jeckyll and Hyde go everywhere with us. Our son is six years old and sleeps with them each night, takes them in the car, travels the house with them. With the exception of one minor repair, they have held up exceptionally well for ""toys"". They get a bath every other week, more if needed. I will add that one of the puppies doesn't have eyes, not really sure when that happened but it's been a while.Last year, when our son went to kindergarten, J&H; would be on the entryway table waiting for him when he got home.The recommendation is 3 & up. My son is delayed and while he received them at 2.5, he was more 1-1.5 developmentally. My other son, now 2.5 himself loves these puppies too and we're scouting out some for him."
2,A fidne mov;ie on a cheap disk,"Item 1 on this page refers to a gave, not a video. tsk, tsk.I will choose a levelm using the stars.The movie was enjoyable. The second time I tried to play it, alli got was ""DISK ERROR."" cHEAP COPY?"
5,Tricksterreprocessed!,"I heard about Kidneythieves when I was playing an awesome PC game called Deus Ex: Invisible War. I was told there were six songs in the game from the album Tricksterreprocess and after hearing the songs, I went online to their site and bought the album. I did some more research and found out that reprocess is the digitally remastered version of Trickster, plus reprocess contains two new songs and a bonus DVD. But since Tricksterreprocess is only available at the KT website, I thought I'd post my review of it underneath the Trickster album. I plan on getting every KT album that's on here! Every track stands out in its own way, plus within the crowds of NIN and such, Kidneythieves stand out on their own. They need their own crowd for their type of music!Does anyone know if they're still around? I just recently went to their site and found out that the latest update from them since was late 2004. Please e-mail me at XNAILSTORMX@aol.com with the subject ""KT Status.""KT Forever!"
3,Hobby Horse,Excellent workmanship in the making of this hobby horse. I will really suprise to see how smooth and uncomplicated this item is. My 16 month old grandson like it.
4,What a gun!! whoa,"Wow, this gun is really good to start your career as a Airsoft player. this gun is preety powerfull, the laser is a little bad but indeed it is a very good pistol. the other accesories are really good it is a real buy this. i tell you buy it it is cheap for its quality i tell you it is a good buy"
4,Hitty: Her First 100 Years- Rachel Feild by A. Walker,"This book was interesting and fun to read. Ride along with, the doll, as she tells her life story. Watch as she goes from one owner to the next. This book is an adventure to read. Hitty has seen so much you forget she is a doll. This book pulles you in like a vacuum cleaner. You'll love it when she travles to New York. You'll jump out of your seat when she goes whale hunting or when she gets stuck in a tree. There is a couple of settings but it doesn't jump around. The message that i got out of the story is live life to it's fullest I would recomend this book to preteen girls that like history and fiction. This book was fantabouls!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed with composition of book,"I bought the hardcover assuming it will be like a modern day hardcover. Rather it was a paperback binded into hardcover and fonts were small and lines were too crowded. Kindle edition would have been better. The content is great and storytelling is great, but overall experience of hardcover book was lost. This review is for specifically the hardcover edition and not for content."
1,Breaks Easily! Not Worth It!,"This gingerbread house kit is a P.of.S! While working on the first one with my daughter, one of the roofs collapsed as we were GENTLY putting candy on top of it. Had to run to the store and buy another one. Same thing happened! Re tried using unbroken parts from both houses to piece it back together and the whole thing just fell apart! I followed directions meticulously, waiting nearly 30 minutes instead of the suggested 15 for the frosting to solidify. I didn't put any more pressure on the thing than necessary but the thing still broke apart.$20 later, I'm stuck with a sloppy, sticky mess in my kitchen, no gingerbread house and a disappointed 4-year-old on my hands! This product sucked!"
3,"Not very ""deluxe"" for the $","It was not very ""deluxe"" for the price. You can get it at a craft store for a lot less money. Not packaged very well. Had a few broken pieces."
1,Big disappointment...avoid this brand.,"Our family makes these gingerbread houses every year at Christmas time - in completely different environmental conditions from hot and humid to cold and nippy. So we have lots of experience putting the houses together so they stand in any conditions. Despite it being cool and no humidity this year, the frosting in this kit was just soft and unable to hold the house sides up or the roof on. The kids finally just gave up and piled the pieces on top of one another."
2,"Awesome gingerbread house, but did not survive shipping","Don't get me wrong, the house is pretty awesome. There are quite a few pieces and accessories, and as gingerbread house kits go, it's very well-stocked. However, it arrived in quite a few more pieces than I expected. All the trimmings and accessories were strapped down well, so those all survived. The main blocks that made up the house itself though were pretty loosely packaged in the box, and those all broke during shipping. All in all a good product, but I think I'll pick it up in stores next year instead of trying to get it shipped."
5,awesome for the price,"but I found it at target and paid $8.00... great kit, but look around because 13 bucks (and almost 10 to ship) is too pricey."
4,"Works fine, looks nice, shipping pricey...","This kit made a nice gingerbread house with everything included. It's not too hard to make something as nice as what you see on the picture. The snowmen and Christmas tree were a little tricky to stand up in the frontyard, but we got it to work eventually. As another reviewer mentioned, the shipping does add over 50% to the cost, so watch out for that before you buy."
1,How do you buy a 20 dollar gingerbread house?,"This is not a review of the quality of the product. I just don't understand how anyone pays this much (even the on sale price) for a gingerbread house unless it is a dollhouse sized mansion with more candy than you buy for halloween.Craft store, Wallmart, even the grocery store has these things.If you are a family who doesn't eat the house, buy a post holiday house on sale and save it for next year, it lasts. You can buy a Halloween house after that holiday and decorate it for christmas - cost 2 bucks.Just saying."
4,Memorable Characters,"I LOVED this book. I bought it because one of my favorite authors, Thomas Pynchon, wrote the forward. I was not disappointed. The characters are all memorable. I loved the definition of the difference between an Outlaw and a Criminal. (In fact, I think most Americans are outlaws at heart and that's what makes us difference from the rest of the world.) I enjoyed the story and Daniel's journey. Without giving too much away, my only problem was that the ending was a little weak. Get this book! You will love it!"
3,quality,"the color was nice but the material is very thin. Not what we're used to going to the military shops, especially for being the same price. Disappointed"
4,...has become the standard guide for my wife's work.,My wife used a borrowed copy and found it to be an excellent guide to filling out term report cards... I had to buy her a copy.
3,Bowling shoes,"Unfortunately when the shoes arrived the top lacing loop was pulled from the seam, making them impossible to tie. the Problem was addressed and the shoes are now wonderful :)"
5,A standard book for digital systems,"This book is a reference for the study of digital systems. I consider it a special one because it is complete, including since the basic concepts on digital logic, like Karnaugh diagram and Boole Algebra, through the study of sequential circuits, memories and introduction to microprocessors. It is a standard book, which every electric-electronics engineer should have in his personal library."
1,This is not the CD you think it is!,This CD is a lot of people screaming there heads off. THIS CD IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. Maybe its just me but I buy music to hear music not to hear people screaming. But at times there is few songs I like so I gave the song 1 star.
2,Missing episodes,"WARNING!!! Disc #4 episodes 11,12 13....#12 AND #13 ARE NOT ON THIS DISC!!Instead it repeats #6 and #10#12 The Godmother and #13 The Quiet Fields are nowhere on my 4 discIn all fairness to amazon they are sending me another copy at this minute. They responded lighting fast and at NO COST to me.Thank You Amazon!!"
4,I love my camera,"I love my DX6490, I did so much research before buying it to go on holiday a few months ago. I am a rubbish photographer, but get great shots, my brother-in-law is a good one and gets awesome shots. It took a couple of days of slightly blurred pictures before I got a handle on how to use the camera, so I'd reccommend buying it a week or so before the big event! I also struggle with the zoom when it is right out, but am stunned by the results when I manage to get past the shake. I think that next time I'll go for a smaller zoom. The macro is fantastic. My inside shots became really good once I got into the habit of putting up the flash! I get frustrated by the fact that the manual is on disk, as I usually need to read it when I am away from my computer, but this would be my biggest gripe.I now have hundreds of photos on my computer and can never decide which to use on my desktop, they all look really good."
2,"Great outdoor perfect-lighting pictures, really poor lowlight pics.","We have had this camera for over a year now. We have had previous good experiences with kodak cameras, so when we bought this one we were confident that it would take great pics. What a disappointment when we realized that it takes horrible lowlight pictures (I mean, really bad!). Outside in perfect daylight, the pictures are clear and really great. Inside or outside in lower light settings, the pictures do NOT turn out at all. I would not buy this camera knowing what I know now. Too bad - Kodak had our loyalty until this experience! We are planning a trip across the US this summer and are going with a different brand hoping for better overall picture quality as we treasure our family pictures and want good quality for them. Our advise is to not buy this - it is not worth the price."
5,This Clock is Fine,"I had read all of the reviews and this clock is fine. I had an identical one and it lasted 5 years and then it did start losing time. I looked all over town to find another and no one has anything even close. I have had this two months now and it is just fine. No complaints. For the money, you cannot beat it. And finding one with a lighted dial at this price is almost impossible. This is a bargain, even if it only goes 5 years."
4,Someone You Should Know,"Good-bye, Mr. Chips by James Hilton is a portrait of an aging man who has mostly good memories about life as a teacher. In a very simple way, the author creates a warm picture of Chips as a man who loved his wife, loved his job and loved his students. All good things must eventually come to an end. When Chips isn't needed in his job any longer because of his age, he focuses on remembering the good times. Mr. Chips is the kind of person who makes the most of situations and has no regrets."
4,A sentimental book that also throws some light on a pretty much forgotten period in time,"Goodbye Mr.Chips is definitely a sentimental book but there is more to it than that. The book depicts some of the social controversies of the time such as the rise of the New Woman and World War I. I was very interested in this aspect of the book and this material served to keep my attention in the more sentimental sections of the book. Mr. Chips, by the standard of the time, was a gentle soul. However, he was still wont to giving thrashings to his students something that would be unacceptable today. This, and many other presentations of life in a school for boys at that time, are interesting for a peek at how things worked in a school back then. In general, between the descriptions of life in the academy of that day and the references to the larger world's events, I found this book to be worth reading."
3,Meniscus cartilage question,"Good information but in addition, I need to know if anyone out there knows about auto grafting/auto transplantation/autoplastic graft as it relates to meniscus cartilage and/or articular cartilage of the knee joint"
4,But I Love When She's a Bounty Hunter,"Like others, I read the 11th book (but it's actually 12 with ""Sugar Plums"") in a day. Stephanie Plum has me in stitches every time! Her forays into drycleaning, serving up grease in a bucket, and evading the smarmy advances of her button factory boss were terrific, but I miss the misstepping bounty hunter.Terrific tension between Stephanie and Ranger as her new boss were just an added bonus. :-)"
2,Not impressed,"First Evanovich book I've read, and I'm not impressed. This novel was not gripping, thrilling or excited, it was mildly entertaining. Eleven on Top had the highest reader reviews among the Plum series, can't imagine enjoying any of the others."
3,Still a fun read,"As with all books in the Stephanie Plum series, this is a fun read with humor and enough mystery to maintain the interest. It is certainly a pleasure to visit these CHARACTERS - a word chosen deliberately - to catch up on their lives. I had been anxiously awaiting this book, but was a little disappointed with the result. Not wanting to give away the storyline, I will just state that the plot seemed as tired as did Stephanie; however, I will continue to purchase and read this series because I always have FUN and LAUGH OUT LOUD --- and that is the best recommendation I can give. Thanks."
4,where can I find men like Ranger and Morelli in real life?!?!,"I love Janet Evanovich's books, and although some of the ideas are getting a bit rehashed, I still laughed out loud several times while reading this book. Grandma Mazur is still a hoot and Ranger is still sexy as hell."
1,Worst Book I ever heard,"I had heard about this author, but never read her. Thank god for that. I tried to finish the first CD of 11 or 12. But it was too awful. What a piece of junk.bill"
1,It goes on and on and on...,"I have, in the past, adored Stephanie Plum. As others point out she is getting stale. This book was truly boring. I can not believe this author would use the same tactics throughout the entire book. She did not really get into the mystery until the final 15 pages (and it was predictable).Actually I didn't think this one was going to be a mystery at all. I cannot think of one new twist, other than alittle insight into Ranger's other life. Just the usual car bombings, food in the hair, Joe or Ranger... Blah, blah, blah. It would have been nice if Janet had used this book to wrap up and marry Stephanie off to one the hunks. Just be done with it. I know I am."
3,More of the same,"I was going to give this a one star rating, but then changed my mind and decided to give it three stars instead. The main reason being that for what this book is, it's okay. Not good, not bad, just okay.There is always going to be a core fan base for this series of books, regardless of whether the books are good or not. Personally, I found this to be more of the same ole, same ole. I think I laughed once while reading this (which is less than I laughed while reading the last book, and I gave that a one star rating.) I'm sure most readers probably love the ""sexual tension"" in this one, but for me, I found it annoying, bordering on boring. The characters are the same, the story is the same, the laughs are the same, but if that's what Evanovich thinks appeals to the fans, and it appears as though she does, more power to her."
4,CD this time,I bought this on CD for the first time. It was funny but still not as funny as 4 & 5!!! Not sure that I liked the ending in this one...glad I didn't sit and read the book this time. Still some good laughs...that Grandma is just too funny!!! And will Stephanie ever decide what she wants to do with her life...Joe or Ranger!!! I guess we'll see what#12 brings!!!My husband has never read any of these; we listened to this in the car when traveling...he was amused!!!I suggest listening to this one rather than reading it!!!
3,STILL FUN,I always enjoy this cast of characters. An easy quick read. Great for a plane ride or just before bed or poolside. Wish I had thought of these funny people. But Stephanie is so messy. She is so smart and I would like her to find something that makes her successful.
3,Typical Stephanie Plum,"Just finished ""Eleven On Top"", Stephanie Plum SeriesThis wasn't one of my favorites in the series. Didn't think it was as funny. The characters and their antics are getting a bit boring. Same story lines. I would like to see characters grow up a bit more and act a bit more grown up now instead of constantly acting like the Keystone cops. I will never give up on Stephanie Plum, Morelli and Ranger. On to the next book."
3,"Better than 10, but not as good as 1, 2 or 3","Life has moved on for Stephanie. She now works for Ranger, so the tension between Steph, Joe and Ranger has moved up a notch. She probably needs to marry Joe to maintain the tension, if she continues to work for Ranger. Lula is now a bounty hunter, and she seems about as capable as Stephanie was.Grandma Mazur is on fine form, unfortunately not much from Stephanie's father in this book. The not-so-perfect Valerie marries Albert Kloughn with the help of Sally Sweet, as wedding planner. The wedding epic was the weakest point in the book, and Stephanie's claims to be able to play a musical instrument was just plain daft. There is less good writing and more madcap lunacy in Evanovich's writing now. Is she a bit senile? It's okay, but not one of her best. Stephanie Plum is still 1000 times better than Metro Girl and the obnoxious Barney and Nascar man.Worth buying, but not at full price."
4,J. Evanovich,Another excellent outing for Ms. Evanovich. Glad to see Stephanie is expanding out her world of chaos but I think Ms. Evanovich has painted herself into a corner with the love triangle. It's going to have to end sometime soon and it will be disappointing whoever Stephanie chooses because both male protagonists are wonderful.
3,LIGHT Reading,"A female bounty hunter - the possibilities are endless, so long as you don't feel limited by reality. The writing isn't bad; in fact, on the strength of this book, I acquired and read another in the series. The two books were so much alike that I have difficulty distinguishing them in my mind. The heroine bounces from one set of improbable circumstances to another and between two alpha males who can and will rescue her from any peril. The characters - all of them, including the heroine - are poorly developed but the story moves so fast, you hardly notice. This is light reading, something you do when you're just trying to pass the time. You won't remember much when you're done."
5,"I love all of Janet Evanovich's books, especially this series.",This whole series was hilarious. My favorite characters in the stories were Ranger and Lulu. Especially Grandma. Read this whole series for a good read.
5,Janet's still terriffic!,"I can't believe that there are 11 books out already, I hope Janet isn't getting tired of crafting Stephanie stories because I love them and can't wait for the next installment.Eleven was very entertaining, and the heat continues between Steph/Joe and Steph/Ranger. Janet does a great job of keeping it steamy but not explict. Personally, I don't want any resolution to Steph's predicament since I love both Ranger and Joe and would hate to see one ""lose""!I was grateful that the climatic showdown of the book didn't follow a cliche and take place at Valerie's wedding.Eleven kept me guessing until the end, and I love the surprise villian, but have to wonder how it will impact the Burg life going forward. Bring on Twelve!"
2,Not so Good,"First of all, I really find Lorelei King annoying as the reader. Her midwestern accent is so miscast(Hat Dag?). She is also not a very good actress. The first Stephanie Plum novel I listened to was read by Debi Mazur. She was absolutely the funniest and the best. Her attitude was perfect. And I have a bulletin for the author: New Jersey natives do not call our state JERSEY. It's NEW Jersey, thank you very much, and if we were to believe the deprecating humor about it in these books one would wonder why it's one of the richest states in the union.I am afraid Stephanie stopped being a sympathetic character in this book. She is self-destructive, wreckless and just plain stupid. Half way through I stopped wanting to be bothered with her. Why on earth these two allegedly sexy men find her to be so delicious is a complete mystery to me; the only mystery in the story, apparently. Enough, already!"
4,The funniest yet,"I've been tearing through her books, relieved that I don't have to wait a week for the next story, like you do for a favorite tv show. And though I admit Stephanie's ""love life"" can get a little old, it's still funny and well-written. Every book has made me laugh out loud, but in my opinion, this was hands-down, the funniest, and a nice break after the anxiety of number 10."
3,Magnets Need to Be Stronger,"They are great for not being seen, but we've noticed that as time goes on the magnets seem to wear down and if the tiniest spec gets on the magnet it will scratch your cabinets will you try to get it open."
1,Hole through my door,"This is a horrible product. I followed the instruction, and drilled within 1/8"" of my door front, the slightest bit past and you will have a 9/32"" hole through your brand new cabinet doors. This happened twice so far, and I only installed 3. I also had to make a shim to fit my door as well. I contacted the manufacturer and they said you will need to buy a stronger magnet, they don't make one. They also are going to send me a replacements set, so that I can put a few more holes through my door. Unfortunately they don't send replacement cabinet doors."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was very disappointed with these cabinet locks. They were difficult to install and, once installed, did not work very well. The magnet was not nearly as strong as it should have been, and I kept having to move it to figure out exactly where the other magnet is so the door would open. We took the latches off and decided to keep only child-safe things in our bottom cabinets. We're much happier that way (and my daughter loves playing with the tupperware, lids, and kitchen towels, etc, that we keep in our bottom cabinets and drawers)"
4,"Good, solid workhorse",This tool set is the basic toolset that every home should have! The tools are built to last without the price.
2,Great Special Effects...Nothing Great After That,"I thoroughly enjoyed the special effects...quite creepy...but beyond that this was a slow-moving...plotless...boring sci-fi flick with little or no substance. Sub-par acting, a horrible soundtrack, and mediocre editing made this one a ""possibility"". It could have been a box-office smash...but it missed on nearly every level. Another reviewer claimed this will grow on you. Not on me. One time is enough. 2 stars...for the special effects."
1,Stay away from this book!,"The authors include diagrams without caring to explain what each of the different kinds of arrows mean. That is, if you want to know what a bold arrow means, you'll have to read the surrounding paragraphs, inferring from its contents and the topics covered what they mean. Even worse, the text itself is unorganized and awfully structured, which makes it a pain to read.Add to the fact that it uses an obscure diagram notation, and it is really an excruciating experience to study from this book. Good luck trying to find info on the net about this notation, you will have a hard time doing it!"
1,Put in your Don't Buy List,"This is the worst text book that I have ever used. The author seems to have no experience of writing text book. The concepts are not explained in the clear/easy understandable way. After reading some of the topics, I did not feel help rather confused. I am really disppointed. I will not recommend this book to any one since it is a big waste of money:-(!"
1,Incomplete!,"The authors have not finished writing this book, so you ought to reconsider purchasing it. Throughout the book, it refers you to the website for the book, which purports to have scripts, files etc for students to use while doing the problems the book provides. However, much of the supplimentary material is MISSING and though myself and other students have tried to contact the authors, we have received absolutely zero response.Frustrating to say the least! Do not buy this book until you can verify that it is in fact COMPLETE."
1,Bad written book,"Had to use this book for my database class at university. The book is poorly written and it is difficult to understand the toipcs the author is attempting to explain.I don't know why they would choose this book for a university class, when the book is clearly not written for students.Steer away."
1,This is the other Eidolon,"This is not the group with the trademarked name of Eidolon. This is a punk-type group with words whose imagery disgusted me. If you were looking for the Eidolon group whose intelligent songwriting and impressive acoustic musicianship is played on National Public Radio and the like, don't make the mistake I did when I preordered ""Eidolon's next album"" -- it isn't this group. I read the words to the first song in the little book that comes in the CD and knew something was very wrong. If you're ""into"" punk, you'll want to avoid the Eidolon I was looking for. Good luck sorting out the confusion."
4,This is the remake,"Both 1939 and 1963 versions have been supposedly based on the same book, ''CORAZON'' by Edmundo D'Amicis, and I say supposedly because there is a difference between them. As I have not read the book, don't know who changed what, Alejandro Galindo or Julio Bracho.1939: The teacher knows his pupils and tries to help them as much as he can. Not only teaches them their lessons but teaches them to become better persons. So much that in the end, after a very important test, some of them are rewarded with scholarships and medals.1963: The teacher arrives as a substitute after the old teacher dies. He learns about each kid and tries to help them as much as he can. Not only teaches them their lessons but teaches them to become better persons. One of the kids, leaves the town to go to the big city searching for his mother, who works there.Both movies are very good. But I still think the remake was not necessary."
3,The previous volumes were better,"This is the fourth volume of the wallflower, and to be honest, I wasn't too impressed with it.Sunako still looks cute , especially since she was the size and shape of a beach ball all throughout the manga. In the previous ones, she appeared as a lady much more frequently. I managed to read the whole thing in 20 minutes, it didn't have much to read, all the pages had a couple or three talk baloons.The story this time was about getting Sunako to become a lady in order to go out with the blind date her Aunt was bringing back. So they try as usual..Having said that , the drawings are very nice, which is why I bought this volume, and it is extremely funny at times. I will definitely buy the fifth also, because I want to know what happens!Up to you to decide :)"
4,Servicable set of tools at a great price,"Let's not beat around the bush: This is a set of cheaptools. These are not the tools your mechanic uses. Theseare not even the tools you would use regularly if you workon your own car (or house). However, as a set of conveniencetools--that is, tools you have stashed away somewherefor quick access when you are too rushed or lazy to dig outthe good ones--this set can't be bettered at the price. Thisis NOT a tool set for heavy use. But it's perfect asan emergency set in your trunk, or a second set around the house,or a starter set for your kids...This tool set features a nice assortment of tools, fromwrenchs to screwdrivers to pliers to sockets and more. 131 piecesfor about the price you'd pay for a single high quality set ofpliers at Sears or from SnapOn or Mack. That tells yousomething inescapable about the quality, but there are timeswhen it's OK to skimp on quality...David"
4,Dark Shadows,"The Dark Shadows set is for a friend, I ope that she enjoys it as much as she did when it was on tv. I have watched the series yet, I am waiting to watch it with my friend.Chris."
5,What a great set.,This exceeded my expectations. I loved this series and was so excited to get it all in one complete set. Love the packaging...what a great concept. A must for any Dark Shadows Fan!
3,Disappointing coffin,"The selling factor of this was not just the complete set itself, but the coffin display case it was packaged in. However, after receiving it, I was highly disappointed to find that it was merely a cardboard construct, torn and split in several places, particularly on the lid. Granted, I could have returned it, but I didn't want to risk something else happening to it in transit, potentially getting another one in the same condition, not to mention having a $400+ purchase in limbo. So I'll settle with some patchwork with black electrical tape and a sharpie to cover the damage. Don't get your hopes up thinking this is a really greatly constructed case. You might be better off finding one in a store so you can examine the purchase first."
