1,"awkward writing, slow plot, poor characters","If you enjoy mysteries, you'll be disappointed. The reader is not given any chance to solve the puzzle... the author simply trots out a series of (uninteresting) revelations.Like character development? You won't find it here. The characters are one-dimensional.The writing is awkward, filled with disconnected, jarring observations, and laughable lines like, ""A fortissimo cry erupter from Bella's mouth.""The author also seems to believe that by sprinkling Italian words through the book, she makes it more authentic. (The words are printed in italics, just to be sure the reader doesn't miss them.)Don't waste your time on this book!"
3,Lackluster Ending to an Otherwise Good Movie,"I'm writing this after watching the movie for the second time - I watched it the first time a little over a year ago. I thought it was pretty good right up until the last 10 minutes, which made little to no sense. I'm not an idiot, and I've watched enough Japanese horror movies to know the endings too often make the viewer think or say WTF?, but it seemed like they couldn't decide on an ending and just threw multiple endings together at the last minute.It's still worth watching, as it did have some creepy moments and well-done scenes (Miike is a fine director), but the poor ending took a lot away from the movie."
2,Steams up!,This watch fogged up every time my wife wore it.Had the seal replaced....but the problem remained.looks nice. But it's a dog at heart.
4,"Quick, give me my torch","I am a fan of creme brulee. So... when I happened upon this book, I just had to buy it. The pictures alone with get your mouth watering (and each recipe has it's own picture), but it's actually the taste of these recipes that will keep you coming back to this book.The recipes are well written, easy to follow, and the ingredient list will not scare you off. In fact, you probably have most of the ingredients in your pantry and refrigerator already.I really like the fact that instructions are given on how to torch the sugar. I know now how far to hold the torch away from the top of the creme as well as how to evenly 'burn' the sugar across the dessert. So with the guidance of this book, my creme brulees look as good as any I order in a restuarant.So far, I have made the classic creme brulee, the double chocolate, and the pumpkin. Each tasted as luscious as their respective picture."
3,Canon Audio/Video to TV Cable,"The product made it simple to view our video movies on a large screen TV - However, I am disappointed in how easy the miniature plug 'pops-out' from the jack on the camera body.Not certain if this is a Canon problem or the plug on the cable is too small."
4,Mini to RCA for Camcorder,This product works well and is just what I was looking for. It is a three to one video cable.
1,Confusing,"When we received the watch monitor the battery was dead. I thought the watch as broken. I contacted Mio to let them know and they said for $22 I could send it in for a new battery...on a brand new monitor! Not good.The product does what it says it will do, but it not user friendly. The watch menus are not easy to use. You have to go through menus to get the info you need , insead of just pushing a button or two."
2,Cheaply made and dirty.,"When I received the twinpack, I opened the packaging impressed with how well they were secured. Unfortunately, the actual product was not nearly as impressive.The UV filter looked to be fine, but was dirty and smudged out of the box.The circular polarizer, however, was much worse. Rotating it resulted in a sickly grinding noise, and the glass was wobbly. I couldn't imagine how I would get an even effect with such a poorly made product.I immediately returned them for a refund, and am waiting on a much higher quality polarizer to arrive."
3,Could use some help,"I bought this book after reading the reviews on it. I have to agree with the review of it not being finished. The book leaves you hanging. It really needs an ending to it. I think it is okay, but I still have to do a lot more explaining with this book than I do ""Little Miss Bossy."" My daughter, who is very smart gets Little Miss Bossy, but asks a lot more questions on Little Miss Stubborn. Good book, but be prepared to end it yourself."
3,Orient,"Do not recommend it, the chronometer failed and lost their adjustment. The manual explains how to set it, but it could not be"
2,Very Disappointed,"Very disappointed that Amazon could sell this as a ""series."" There is only one episode of 95 minutes with David Jason's love interest a woman who could be his Grandaughter and did not add a thing to the plot. All of the other series have at least 3 episodes.Hopefuly, Amazon and BBC Television will begin listing this as just one show instead of misrepresenting it as a series."
3,Not up to par,"I'm a great fan of this series. But the time to stop has arrived. This single 95 minute movie (hardly a season) has a very weak story and resorts to a series of gross situations that reflect the sad state of our popular culture today. And then there is the ""love interest"" between Frost and a woman young enough to be his granddaughter. (She's also about four inches taller.) Ridiculous. A great series gone sour. Enough!"
1,This is not Series 13 of Touch of Frost,"I own a multi-region dvd player, so have ordered Frost from Amazon UK in the past - up to series 12. The episode (Endangered Species) in Amazon's ""Series 13"" was the final episode of season 12. I checked the Amazon UK site, and Series 13 supposedly has a run time of 279 minutes. I ordered Series 14 from Amazon at the same time and it contains 3 episodes. I don't know what went wrong with their (Amazon USA) version of Series 13, but I hope to get a refund."
3,Just what I expected,Last page has been given some extra play and is worn but expected with a used item. I am surprised that Kipper is so expensive for new items. I suppose it is now a collector's item.
2,Poorly researched,This book is poorly researched. One section of the book talks about fungi being plants that do not undergo photosynthesis. This idea has not been accepted by the science community since the mid 50s. It goes on to mention potato blight as common pathogenic fungi....potato blight is not casued by a fungi. The causative pathogen (an oomycete) was once in the kingdom fungi but later moved to a different kingdom in the late 70's. This leads me to beleive that the authors have taken a lot of updated information for granted. I could go on and on about this book. If you are new to gardening and and want something to ready this is an OK book. If you want or need a book that give real uptdate advice this is not the book. In my opinonin this book falls into the catagory of books that are ment to be on a coffe table and not really used. A good name was used to sell a poor product.
1,"To full of ""I"" and ""me""",I liked his Trilobite book but this one was so filled with who he knew and what he did that there was little meat about the book's subject.
2,"More stuff, less fluff please.","Fortey is surprisingly adept at constructing an elegant English sentence. And he makes this clear to the reader over and over and over again. During the entire page that Fortey spent musing about the early death of the ""English Mozart"" George Frederick Pinto, finally to compare it to the early extinction of some Cambrian animal, I found myself thinking how much I'd rather be shown a drawing of a Cambrian animal, or perhaps read a brief definition of ""mitochondria"" or ""brachiopod"". I don't think I'd exaggerate to say half the book is spent in elegant digressions into his career, pop culture, the arts, and myriad other tangential topics, while the other half suffers from a deficit of detail. Perhaps he thought these would engage the reader, but I, for one, am a reader who found the title engaging and would like to read a good deal more about it than this book offers."
3,Sometimes slow but a good book,"""A Natural History of the First Four Billions Years of Life on Earth"" is a pretty big pill to swallow. Depending on your interest you might not think he takes enough time here and there to explain current thinking but I can't imagine a better springboard to the big picture. He writes well but does seem to go on a bit - sometimes I wasn't quite sure where. A good book, though, with tons of information."
2,where was the editor?,Do not read this book if you are interested in learning about the history of life. There are much more concise and precise books on this subject out there.Do read this book if you wish to see a scientist quote poetry. attempt to be funny and meander from topic to topic in a stream-of-consciousness format.
4,Battery works well,"I have a an ancient (that's 8 years in techonology time) Dimage camera, and the batteries that came with it can no longer hold a charge. Bought two of these for a trip abroad and they held a charge for a good long time."
1,Keb Mo? Puh-leez,"If you honestly can't bring yourself to say the words ""I shot a man in Reno/ just to watch him die,"" I guess that's okay. There's just one requirement with that condition, and that is that you don't ever, EVER attempt to sing Folsom Prison Blues. Whoever let Keb Mo do that song on an album without the most important line should be fired, and Keb Mo should be kept from recording ever again. Heresy. Blasphemy. Scandal. A pox on everyone who let this happen."
3,Crawford ladder stabilizer,"Good stability, but the bumpers on the ends are slick plastic. Wanted to get ""mitts"" like you can for the end of the ladder, so it won't slip or mar the painted surface. Crawford says they make these, but its hard to find them."
5,High-Quality,First time ever changing my own oil on my Ninja 250. It went perfectly. Filter locks in tight and all gaskets seat nicely as well. Definitely recommend this filter.
4,Wrong Picture,"This is a fine filter, but it is not as shown in the picture. It does not have a chrome cover."
5,"Ah, a legal fakebook","Many years ago in the '50's, a tenor in my choir spoke of a fake book, illegal though it was, Ijumped at the opportunity to get one. Indeed, hemanaged to get three, expensive, but great for me and my guitar.Now, unable to find my wife-packed books [did Ijust say that?], it's grand to have one that's enjoyable, and legal."
4,Very nice,"This is a very nice book, price was about what I would expect to pay, and the book is obviously well made and easy to assemble"
1,Good router if it works,"I bought this router about two months ago to replace my old netgear router because of Draft 802.11n specification and better range.The setup of the router was very simple and configuration options looked very promising (Traffic shapping, uPnP support, WPA2 etc) for the router of this cost.. until the router simply died on me while I was working. There was no indication of any kind of power fluctuation etc (All my other devices continued to work during this time).I am not sure if I just got a bad piece or the quality of this product is suspect. It does look like more reviewers in this site have success with this router."
1,nothing but trouble,when i first got it it worked most of the time......after awhile sometimes.....now it doesn't work at all....piece of junk........only 90 days old.....don't buy!!
2,RangeBooster,I have poor reception at the end of my condo. A friend recommended I upgrade from a g router to an N. I purchased this router plus an N RangeBooster network adapter for my laptop. I found no difference in range and returned the products. The good news is that the Amazon return procedure was excellent; easy and no hassle.
2,Intermittent drops,"this product works well, when it works.... for whatever reason, my router keeps resetting itself often, but i think it is just receivng too much interference... dont go draft N.. go N"
4,"D-Link DIR-625, a good router...that could have been even better.","-The documentation package of the D-Link DIR-625 is excellent so does the setup steps. The D-Link configuration utilities are very easy even for the regular user.-This unit could be set either vertical or horizontal position (there is a stand included).-All ports and lights are clearly labeled or color coded.-This unit comes with QoS a technology that helps streaming media and VoIP (Skype, Vonage, Video chat, etc) with reliability.Cons:-This unit like most Draft-N does not fully operate with other brands at its full speed.-Do not believe all the publicity, since when it comes to real life configurations, I cannot see that much difference in speeds between G and N routers. The best results are obtained when you are using matching N routers and N adapter cards.Note:Make sure you upgrade the firmware before you setup the router to avoid bumping into some bugs."
2,Poorer range than people are saying.,"I switched from an old Netgear router I got used three years ago. It was five years old and had a better range than this router! Sure, I like the features. Many ways to tweak settings, most of which I know nothing about. I was looking for gaming range and quality signal. I live in a railroad style apt with a lot of brick walls. Is that affecting the signal? All I know is, I get 1 bar max on my Xbox 360 in the living room (and I'm using the 360 wireless adapter). Which means I get kicked off every other minute. We have a SMALL apt. Less than 1000 square feet. Come on. It should be able to handle that at least."
1,"Unreliable, drops, crap connection most of the time.","This router worked ok for about 6 months then became my worst nightmare. Good when it's connected, connection drops often. I have tried everything to resolve this but it simply won't keep a good connection for very long. Already replaced it with a Netgear router which hopefully will be more reliable."
5,Great Product,Works well. Auto focus is a nice feature. Image quality is good. Great value. I would recommend it to friends.
4,I spy,"This lens is bright and crystal clear. The images are crisp and pristine. Although the price was reasonable, the model is a previous and discontinued version of the lens. I believe this information should have been disclosed by Amazon and/or the seller. The product is quality, but I dislike the deception. I probably would have purchased the lens if I had known it was a discontinued model. I dislike that the vendor was disinclined to reveal the information."
5,Does the Job.,This lens fits my need of taking close of pictures of small items. It does this in lower light and does make clear sharp photos. It is a great lens for the application.
5,Canon EF-S f2.8 60mm Macro Digital SLR lens,This product has impressive build quality and really does the job I bought it to do. The picture quality is sharp and the colors true. I'm excited about the range of photographic possibilities this lens opens up to me. Well worth the money.
5,The Complete Book of the Quarter Horse,"This book is a must-have for any Quarter Horse breeder or enthusiast. It is full of wonderful information and photos of all the important foundation horses. The author's style is rather dry and technical, but it has to be if you're discussing bloodlines, I suppose. A truly absorbing book for Quarter Horse lovers!!"
4,Useful starter,"This book is well written with good explanations and illustrations of difficult neuroanatomy (eg brainstem and eye movements are covered extremely well) and is particularly easy to read and comprehend. Some essential concepts are included that I havent seen in other texts. The author includes clinical case studies from his own experience, which are sometimes quite useful in illustrating the more obscure presentations of some conditions. I think the neurogenetic section needs updating. It does not cover the anatomy of the ventricular system. Irrespective of this, you wont be dissapointed if you buy this book, and it is something you will refer to frequently to clarify finer points of neuroanatomy."
1,"Warming sometimes translates as ""burning""","Be wary of K-Y Warming Liquid or other warming liquids. I have had experience with this product alone and with a couple of partners. The liquid does indeed feel warm when applied, though I only sometimes found it enjoyable. The consistancy is less than stellar, and the taste is absolutely god-awful.But the worst part is that one experience left my girl running to the shower in order to get rid of the ""burning"" sensation that she felt.Overall? Do you really need a warming sensation? Think carefully, and make sure you test it in a small quantity to make sure there are no unexpected problems."
5,"""...yuugure ni kimi to mita...""","You know it'll be a good movie when it's got HYDE [and] GACKT! Being a fan of L'arc-en-ciel and Malice Mizer I wanted to see how my vocalists did as actors. And it was beautiful. Gackt (Sho) started a little rough vs Hyde's 'I've got it under control so CHILL' Kei. Yes, there will be gunfights, but for the most part it is comical (I say that because...). Although Happy Pizza :) is the only thing made clear about the gangs, all will be implied and understood. Yi-che...annoyed me. I don't know why. Her presence just angered me. [shrugs]You can read the plot (that's what the description is for o.o) but it doesn't go into detail about how Sho is struggling /along with/ Kei. In the end, you will see the (orange glow) light.If you don't see it because of Gackt and Hyde, if you don't see it because of how =excellent= it turned out, see it because they have this wonderful talent of switching from Japanese to Cantonese (spelled?(...)) to English.LOOK FOR THE HIDDEN DDR PADS!!"
3,moon child,"i liked the movie but no english version only subthe back ground music was 5 star goro composseracting was good. two of the stars looked kind of gay, tei & sho, to much makeup, toshi was good and son and shinji to.i have a copy of the moive, so for personal use i got somekids to help me translated in english were still working on itand spanish it was difficalt to sinkronize lip movement"
4,Great product and DVD combination,"To whom it may concern:This item was purchased with the DVD. My daughter loves to use them and will even perfer to practice her violin to talking with her freinds and playing video games.Sincerely,Harold"
5,Excellent DVD. Perfect guide for beginners.,"We purchased this DVD when my young children started playing the violin. It was the perfect accompaniment to their lessons. They loved watching the DVD, and doing so only increased their interest in practicing and playing. Ms. Rhoda offers terrific instruction in form and playing that will provide a rock solid foundation for any beginner violin player. An absolutely worthwhile purchase!"
3,Basic Filter Kit,For what I paid I am quite happy. I have had the uv filter on since I got the set. I have been shooting with the polarizer with satisfaction. I shoot up alot with the sky as the background. I like them so far althought I have not yet tried out the warmer.The filters came faster than the adapter - the shipping was quick and the buying experience was smooth.Kurt
2,Very little filter on reflection.,"the Circular Polarizer filter has very little filtering on reflections on glass, water or the sky, the UV filter I use as a lens protector and the other tinted filter has very little value on enhancement on light. I would not recomment this kit."
4,Just a standard kit,Well these filters do what they are supposed to. They are the standard set. There is nothing exceptional or disapointing about them.
1,Threads Didn't Work,Everything about these filters seemed great until I tried to thread them together (as I would on the camera). The threads would not fit together. I ended up with Hoya filters which seem to work fine.
1,Wrong size,"I have a Cannon Camera with 55mm lens, i bought the 55mm filters from Tiffen and they wouldn't fit, i have bought other brands and they have fitted perfectly. I don't know if it is manufacturing defect or lack of technical information from Tiffen and Amazon to make for my lack of technical expertise."
4,Good Value - Trusted Name,Tiffen has been a household name for amateur photographers for many years and I have bought their filters over the years. The three pack of these filters was a perfect fit for my Nikon D80 and the 2 lenses (I already had a UV filter for one lens so this was for the additional zoom lens).No complaints on filter or the ordering process.
5,Good starter kit for Nikon D5100,I had just bought a Nikon D5100 twin lens kit and wanted the Tiffen filter kit as a starter filter set. I am a total novice at photography and the expense of the better known brands seemed outrageous for what differences would be imperceptible to me. Fast international delivery and no hassles as product is as described.Plato
1,Useless filters,"I've played with these filters numerous times and haven't been happy with the results. That said, I've only worked with them when using b/w film, so maybe they have a better response with color."
4,Not sure about it !,I feel that these filters are not required if you have digital camera the coze you you can do what ever you like by computer graphics programs only the UV protector is important.
3,A Good Stick Fighting DVD for Beginners,"""Filipino Stick Fighting"" taught by Lester Griffins is a good beginners DVD. Lester Griffins demonstrates basic blocks, strikes and combinations, as well as simple footwork to be used with these techniques.The DVD runs about 55 minutes; about 30 minutes of which is good instruction. There are several minutes of full-contact stick fighting shown at the end of the DVD (Dog Brothers stuff) which is worth seeing, but between these two segments is Griffins trying to demonstrate stick fighting drills in a swimming pool. Training in water is a useful technique, but I felt the swimming pool segment distracted from the quality of an otherwise decent instructional DVD.I have mixed feelings about this DVD. Lester Griffins clearly has skill in stick fighting, and one can learn some basic techniques from studying this DVD, but there is nothing that makes this DVD stand out from other stick fighting DVD / Videos on the market."
5,Great Watch at Greater Price,I got this watch for my wife who's owned (and loved) Locman watches in the past. They were over $400 in Nieman Marcus and this one was only $129. Works and looks great.
1,Didnt fit,I had purchased this cable to get my panasonic cam recorder to connect with my I mac. The plug for the mac side did not fit! bummer
4,Good One,This Product was an exact match for my CANON ZR40 Camcorder. You will have to buy a 4Pin Male - 4 Pin Male Firewire cable. I was able to interface with my DELL Inspiron Laptop (this has a 4 Pin firewire port)
5,A good buy....,The layout of this book is very confusing. It doesn't really matter because it's packed with great phrases throughout and it's extensive. The midi files come in handy too. It covers arpeggios nicely which is important. One thing I've noticed about this kind of learning material is the approach to diminished scales. Most often they are done 2 notes per string. I find this difficult to do but it is easy to substitute with more farmiliar fingerings.All around this is a great book that should provide inspiration for guitarists.
1,THANK YOU AMAZON,"I saw an article on this book in CIVILIZATION magazine and looked forward to buying it. Just as I was about to call the Library of Congress and order it, I thought I would check Amazon. Thankfully, Amazon reviewers noted the conspicuous shortcomings of this expensive book. Thank you, Amazon for saving me money. Buy the magazine - all the maps are in color."
5,cornerchisselreview,"You won't be disappointed. It is well designed, does not require instructions, and has few moving parts to break. Mine is still working after 2+ years. I haven't even had to sharpen it-yet. You won't find it at Harbor Freight. It is worth it. Just buy the dumb thing! Tom"
3,Helpful manual!,"If you know nothing about iMoviw or iDVD, this book will help you understand the basics of what you need and what you DON'T need. Very simple program with good muscle under the hood."
4,Price and Quality,"This product offers a realy equity between price and quality, and a good results in photos."
1,Mean spirited.,"The author accuses the victims of being nasty people. This is a very disappointing book. When I finished reading it, I felt even more hurt."
1,Not a good test prep,"Not all Microsoft Press books are equal. This one is difficult to read, overly complicated and poorly organized. I stopped studying with this book and switched to a CDROM-based video training program, which proved much better."
3,No more Jar?? Just a tube..!!,"I recently ordered the Jar( 1.75oz.) of NeoStrata Face Cream Plus AHA15.A great product. However, what I received was a smaller 1.4 oz. 'tube' of this product, (a picture of the JAR was on the order page!!!!) I was charged for the price of the 1.75oz. jar, even though I got the 1.4oz. tube. Shame on you Amazon and NeoStrata (SkinCareRx) for deceiving me with that ad placed on Amazon AS A JAR, at $23.95"
5,Love love love this!,I saw this at a friends house. It is a pretty great concert movie if you love this band. I would recommend this to any Tokio Hotel fan!
2,"Bulky, useful only to hikers/backpackers",Motorists driving the roads of coastal California will find little useful information here. The book does have exhaustive information about all parks you might drive by!
4,Thanks Soprano's,"We heard a tract from this CD at the end of a Soprano's season. Glad we bought the entire CD. Not our usual genre, but very good!"
2,Get the information from the source,The book describes how to setup a basic configuration of FogBugz on your own server. The information is the same as you would get in the online documentation with some added commentary. There are a couple of extra sections on plugins and the book does a good job explaining the structure of the database FogBugz uses.I consider this book a waste of money as you can get the same information from the online manual which will be more up-to-date.
4,A good reference for the occasional technical writer.,"Bugs in Writing is a ""Strunk and White"" for the technical crowd. In short, easy to digest (though occassionaly conflicting) sections, Dupre covers the writing problems she has encountered while editing technical manuscripts, and lays out clear examples of how to fix them. I keep this book within easy reach."
4,Interesting....,"Let's start with the good things...I loved the plot. I thought that the lead female character was awesome. The book is a breathe of fresh air in the ""vampire hunter"" genre. However, the writing could use some improvement. There were certain scenes where the writing didn't...flow like it normally did. This is not for the little vamp lovers!! Swearing, sex, and gore are aplenty in the book.It was a very original book. The concept of ""the Other"" was very cool. It was an over all good book. If you like Hamliton before she turned porn, get this book. If you want a good vamp book to accompany you on those lonely nights. GET THE BOOK NOW.(The artwork on the cover is stunning too...but you can't judge a book by its cover now can we?)"
4,Good Basic Approach,"The book presents good diet guidelines. Anyone who follows these guidelines will probably be eating in a healthier manner than they were before. While I do not agree with everything, I agree with 90% and I have been examining diet recommendations for more than 25 years."
5,"""Gllllllorious album""!!!!!","Hi!...thanks for reading this review!..forget the 1st. reviewers comments ..this is a 5 star c.d. Christian , or otherwise , this is still one of my favourite singers , and only Dion (di mucci) seems to be able to touch the human heart in such a poweful manner !!""Centre of my life"", ..""Sweet Lord Jesus"", ...especially ""The Truth will set you free""!, ( my all-time favourite Dion song!!!!!) ..all the soings on this c.d. are truly remarkable , and , friom a Christian perspective (which i am !) ...incredible!!!!!BUY!!!!!"
3,"Maturing, but not enough yet...","No tan bueno como sus discos mas recientes (Teatro Real, Picasso en mis Ojos). Vale la pena comprar solo por la ultima cancion del disco: ""Vidalita"".Not as good as later albums (Teatro Real, Picasso en mis Ojos). Worth the buy for the last track: ""Vidalita""."
5,"Great Product, fast delevery and very affordable","This product is very durable, perfect size, and very lightweight. I love it. Very simplistic and very reliable."
5,Outstanding widescreen HD TV at a reasonable price,"Contrary to popular opinion, you don't have to buy an expensive plasma or LCD (liquid crystal display) TV to get a great high-definition picture. In fact, many experts (including Consumer Reports) assert that high-definition TVs using traditional cathode-ray tube technology -- as this high-definition Sony does -- currently offer a sharper picture than plasma and LCD TVs, plus they are much less expensive and more reliable. This widescreen HD Sony TV has a very good picture with standard broadcasts and an outstanding picture with HD broadcasts and DVDs. If you'd like to get a widescreen high-definition TV now but you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on an expensive plasma or LCD set, please consider this 34"" Sony. The picture is superb and the price is quite reasonable."
4,Ricky review,I didn't care for all the songs. But the ones I wanted were there. The disc was recorded well. I was happy with this product.
5,Used in Saltwater,"Took mine on a trip to the Caicos island where it was promptly dropped, mauled and possibly even slightly neglected (I never soaked it after bringing it out of the saltwater). Worked without flaw. Just as easy to use as without the case. If you've got kids, for Pete's sake buy one of these. While making it not only virtually trash proof, it enables you to take it places you would probably never take your digital camera otherwise... to the beach, to the pool. Forget about it! Got mine at scuba.com for $150."
2,just aight,alot of this Material is just kinda there&not even worthy of a Burn on a disc.some aight cuts at the start. most of the better of the stuff is at the start of this Compilation.when these Sets do as well as they do they just show that more than ever there are far more singles Acts than Album artists.but these Compilations serve there purpose.but I wish it was with the better stuff on a whole than some so-so to forgetable cuts making the final Cut.
3,Good but doesn't beat Now 17,"This is a good CD. I liked ""Turn Me On"", ""Roses"", ""On The Way Down"", ""This Love"", ""Don't Tell Me"" and a few others. But, I liked Now 17 better. It had better songs and more chart-topping. Totally Hits 2004 #2 was a good CD, but I would buy Now 17 too because you'll probably like the tracks better."
4,Fun Read II,"This is a great, fun, historical fiction work. As said by others, it may not provide doctoral-level historical information, but it provides an exciting and beautiful backdrop to a fast-paced story. To expect otherwise is a bit unfair. She is not distributing a textbook. In addition to it being a fun read, it makes the reader want to visit the rolling hills and tidewater areas of Virginia, and the paradise that is Bermuda."
4,Sensei Ray Dalke,Sensei Ray Dalke was very inspirational to me inmy brief study of Shotokan at the University ofCalifornia at Riverside.His #1 student Edmund Otis was also inspirational.I cannot speak highly enough of Dalke and Otis.They ran one of the very top classes in the worldand everyone knew it.There is certainly no substitute for in-person practice.Stuart
5,"Subversives ""protest and dance""","I literally compare these guys to the Oxymoron of the US.. If you are into punk / street punk you will love this album. Track 1,3 and 5 are the best tracks on the album. If it puts into perspective mainly I listen to hip hop now but still like SOME of the punk I used to listen to and The Subversives are still one of the bands that I still blast in my car. Guarantee satisfaction for anyone who loves street punk.. These guys are amazing !!!"
5,A very gifted writer,"A engaging and enthralling collection of stories. Mr. Ardizzone is a very gifted writer who combines all elements of life, be it realistic or magical, contemporary or traditional, and it is done in an enjoyable and immediate manner. He joins the ranks and stands proud with the gifted writers and poets who hail from and write of Chicago. My hat is off to this writer and this work."
5,Moon Phase Manga,I was very satisfied with the product. I came in in a short amount of time and was in good quality. It was also very interesting.
4,Fun and Funny,"I enjoyed this book in which Dorothy returns to Oz. There, she meets wonderful new friends in a quest to return the royal family of Ev to their kingdom. Very good book indeed."
1,Ladder bag is junk!,"Bought this bag when I purchased a larger Telesteps ladder.. I wast charactarized as being canvas. It is actually a woven plastic material that looks like canvas. My previous Telesteps bag for my smaller ladder is canvas and is still in good condition after ten years. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for this latest bag. Both zippers are completely separated and useless. The bag is already torn. I lay my ladder on the bag and use the Velcro top to actually close the bag. I can't believe Telesteps has allowed this bag to be used for their ladders. Please, Please do not waste your money. This bag is a complete piece of junk sold by a company in Grand Prairie Texas."
2,There are better alternatives,"I've used Porter-Cable with much success. I tried to save a few dollars and go this route. Trust me, it doesn't come close and won't hold up for more than a couple of doors. Do yourself a favor and go with Porter-Cable."
2,Archival Benefit,"I expected the footage to be somewhat degraded, but was hopeful that given the product editorial: ""This tape is top quality..."" I might be in for a pleasant surprise. I was, the footage is so grainy and dark that you cannot make out the faces. The only advantage to the production is for the witness via glimpses now and then of titans of karate in their prime. Be suspicious of offerings from Rising Sun Video Productions: witness the botched sound quality of their Hirokazu Kanazawa ""Mastering Karate"" series."
4,Ideas more than instructions,"This book has many ideas, but if you're more of a beginner, you probably won't be able to duplicate a lot of what you see. Still, as more of a beginner myself, I was able to mark several pages that I can go back to for ideas."
5,Keeps me safe,"Sturdy, strong, safe. I am 240 and have been using this with a 24ft ladder to reach the second story roof. I don't know what I was thinking using the ladder before without this thing. I could tell a huge difference between using the ladder without the stabilizer and with. Works as advertised on corners also. The pads do fall off from time to time when I move the ladder around but nothing a touch of super glue won't fix.Highly reccomended."
1,Horrible Quality,"I ordered this guitar hoping for a nice decent guitar that was'nt to expensive. When it arrived, i was greatly disapointed. The glue-job was terrible, the sticker around the sound hole was peeling, as well as the pick-guard. Furthermore, the strings rattled and the string boards were crooked and bent. Even for a cheap guitar i expected a lot more. I would'nt buy this guitar for even 10 dollars. THIS IS A HORRIBLE BUY!!!"
1,So Glad You Asked,"This item did not fit our needs as we expected it to, but I found it so costly to return to the manufacturer for exchange that the pot sits unused in my son's home. It was a wasteful and disappointing purchase.ES"
4,Alright towel,"The towel is alright, but I expected something a little more different, atleast a bit larger size. Make sure to check the size before buying. Eventhough you know your size, try to compare it with your other towels to make sure you know what you are getting."
4,Surprisingly sturdy,"This unit assembles quickly with push buttons, and although a little rickety, holds many sizes of bikes securely in place. It would be nice if the unit connected together more tightly."
2,A So-So bike stand,"My men's mountain bike falls over in the stand, so I have to lean it against a wall. The last time it fell it damaged my handle bar grip, so I'm a bit mad. The stand did go together easily, but it isn't robust enough for a bigger bike."
4,The 100% Better Version of GBA,"The SP is a small step for gamers but a giant leap for Nintendo. The convience, fun, and portability of the GBA just got better. The SP is smaller, easier on the hands, and has an illuminator behind the screen so you can actually see the game you're playing. Also the SP doesn't switch games so you can still get the GBA Games for it."
1,Dirty,"Description said ""like new"" but when I got it it was extremely dirty and the screen had permenant spots on it"
4,Best one yet,"The new game boy advance Sp is the best one yet! The design is perfect, including conviniatly placed buttons.PROS- A backlight (a light built into the screen - like a tv has so that you can see it in the dark with out turning on the lights) for at night play, in boring movies, on the airplane, or on long road trips.- the L and R buttons are convenientily placed- built in battery that is charged by connecting the gameboy to an in the wall outlet, or car outlet- while the battery is charging you can still play a game- you control wether you want the back light on or not- can play game boy, game boy color, and game boy advance games, as well as the new videos available- better than a video now player for videos, this screen is lighted like a tv screen, in color, and has a bigger screenCons- there are none!"
5,"If you want the best for playing anywhere, buy this one!","I first had the original Gameboy Advance, it was great, with incredible graphics, great sound and amazing games, but it has one big problem... you couldn't play it without a good ilumination, that was a big problem because in the night you should sit down right bellow a lamp to play, but all that is gone now, with the new integrated screen light in the Gameboy Advance SP you can play virtually anywhere, even if in total darkness, but that's not all, this gameboy is small and easy to carry in your pocket, plus the screen is protected to scratches because it's not exposed until you open it; other great thing is the rechargable battery, it gives you about 13 hours of playing with only 3 hours of charging!, so, if you are searching for the best for playing anywhere but this, and remember that there are thousands of games out there, some of then incredible!."
4,As a textbook,"Power Sales Writing is valuable for writers and for anybody doing sales work. It is a down-to-earth and fun resource.I use this book as a text in a Telecommunications course I teach: ""Writing for Sales"". Sue gives concrete examples on style, content, and methods for writing good sales proposals and letters. I especially enjoy the section on etiquette for writing and sending emails."
5,Write like a sales pro the easy way,"Power Sales Writing is an excellent tool for those who want tominimize the time they spend writing while maximizing the results ofit. Let Sue Hershkowitz-Coore show you how to make your points, closethe sale and keep the customers coming back for more.- Michael LeBoeufAuthor of ""How to Win Customers and Keep Them for Life"""
5,An inspiring story of the wonder of love and forgiveness.,"The Christmas Wish is a heartwarming story of a man's legacy of love, kindness, and forgiveness that reaches beyond his life to touch all who meet and know him. Grandfather's life teaches his grandson, Will the true meaning of forgiveness and love which reaches beyond one's own family. Will finds something in himself that he hasn't realized he has lost until he tries to fulfill Gram's Christmas wish. A touching story to read again and again."
4,Fun with Japanese,"What impressed me right away was the fun these hosts are having with the Japanese language. I've taken so many courses where the instruction was just really dry and flat, it was so cool to get this DVD where people are actually having a good time teaching and speaking Japanese!That said, this isn't an instructional video for beginners, but for someone like me who's had a little bit of Japanese instruction already and wants to move to the next step of talking like you know what you're saying! My Japanese friends tell me they sometimes hear the same things over and over from beginners, so I definitely won them over with the phrases from How To Impress Your Japanese Friends.I prefer Keiko much more than Chie, and George (the main host) tries to have fun with them both, but I think Keiko ends up being more fun. I also liked that the hosts were mostly native speakers of Japanese so it was real-life conversation, not textbook."
2,"Kids love TRAINS, not kiddie songs","My 24 month old LOVES trains and everything about them. He does not, however, like kiddie music. With a title like ""Kids Love Trains"" I thought it would be a hit with him. Not. About 10 minutes into it, he grew tired of the music and asked for a different video. The music detracts from the train footage and the things that he wants to hear and see. My child's all time favorate train video is ""Choo Choo Trains, Close Up and Very Personal,"" which is also the one I would recommend. If your child wants to see and hear trains, there are better videos out there. If your child loves kiddie music and trains are a sideline interest, this is the video for you."
3,Kids Love Trains,"It is a wonderful video and my 4 year grandson who lives in Seattle had seen it before and loved it. The only problem is that there are several places where the sound skips. It does not bother him and he has it now, so I did not return it."
1,save your money!,The video quality of this video is horrid and I don't buy the excuse that it is because the footage is old. Even the computer graphic opening menu is blurry and full of macroblocks. Whoever mastered this video should be shot for this chump hack job! Save your money. It is a shame that a video covering the grand master is so shoddy.
4,This CD rocks and is funny as hell in places!,I am not sure how i got this cd but i love it.Chosen Ones & Foolish Love are similar to other 80's power ballads3HC is as funny as AC/DC's Big BallsShes a bitch is a perfect song if your ex wife (like mine) is a real big bitch. The chorus consists of the men in the band shouting Shes A Bitch.East Coast rose is decent as is Out With The Boys.All in all a solid effort. I wish they had done a follow up so they had a second chance to get big
3,Beautiful Concept...A Bit Repitious.,"Like the title my review suggests, Mickey Hart/Taro Hart's concept CD, Music To Be Born By, does good in concept but the piece is a bit redundant or repitious.It has a nice melody against Taro's fetal heartbeat and Mickey's lite percussive rhythm, but it doesn't go anywhere as a change in tune - it is just continuous.The CD is a nice relaxer for about 10-20 minutes. After that it gets boring.Maybe if I was in labor I would understand the premise more clearly.Bottom line, it needed a bit of variation on the tune - not the rhythm.A fair job by Mickey & Co."
3,"Love the album, but not the original Ryko release as advertised","I love this album, and bought it to replace a long-ago stolen copy. I hadn't seen it on the market for years, so I was pretty excited to find it. Unfortunately, Amazon and sellers don't do a very good job of being careful about what edition they're selling--this was advertised as the original Ryko release, but it was not. I actually ordered two copies- one from a seller and one from Amazon's own stock. NEITHER were the original release version as advertised.Don't get me wrong, I'm VERY glad that the Smithsonian Folkways Archive has finally reissued this classic concept album, but sadly, it does not include the original liner notes. Luckily, I still have my original Ryko case and insert, so it isn't the end of the world for me. But still, PLEASE SAY WHAT YOU'RE SELLING, AND SELL WHAT YOU ADVERTISE!! Substitutions are NOT OK unless explicitly advertised as such by the seller."
3,60's Soul Jazz.,I vaguely remembered the title tune while browsing Amazon. So on a lark I purchased the CD. I am glad I did. Once I heard the title tune it came back to me. The music is instrumental jazz in a 60's soul vain. It is like Ramsey Lewis Trio with vibes added. Not all songs are great but over all the music has a soulful feel to it and goes dowm well.
3,"AN AGED, BUT STILL WELL-DONE JOB","Sir Flinders Petrie was a reknown Archaeologist and Egyptologist even beyond the circle of scientists devoted to the study of Pharaonic Civilization. So that, at the time of writing and printing the original edition, the offered translations of a selected group of ancient Egyptian literary pieces was considered a fine task carried out to its end and fulfilling its purposes. But many years have elapsed since those days and Egyptology has kept pushing forward; as a consequence, much better translations and analyses of these texts can be found in more recent books dealing with the literature of the Egyptians. This book can be recommended only as a token of completeness in the bookshelves, especially for the section on the immortal ""Father of Scientific Archaeology""."
5,Direction,David knew just what he was doing when he did this one. He had a direction he was going in and knew what he needed to do to get the rest of us there. And he was so subtle about it. I love these tracks. I have had them in every format. Which is why I love this new technology. Can't wear them out now.
4,Space Oddity,"Space Oddity being Bowie's 1969 release and his 2nd studio album contains one of his famous tracks ""Space Oddity"". Other fine tracks is the angry and impassioned ""Letter to Herminone"". The booklet has some very fine photographs of a very young looking Bowie. All the lyrics are included and we also get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."
3,Man of Words and Music,"The first of his ""rock"" albums is rather unique in the Bowie canon, featuring, as it does, mainly narrative lyrics accompanied by acoustic instruments. For anyone who reckons Bowie is all artifice or that he can only write abstract lyrics, listen to this and re-evaluate.The songs are, on the whole, rather fine. Apart from the title track, standouts include Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud, Letter to Hermione and Memory Of A Free Festival (although there's a better, electric version doing the rounds). The rest of the songs are pretty nice too.It's a gentle introduction to David Bowie and listening to this album, you'd never believe there was a glam rock monster waiting to be spawned."
2,Innovation over inner vision,"2 1/2One of the few artists whose consistencies can't seen to generate emotionally resonant output for me, this album, like many I have, has all its merit in a few choice songs and otherwise plagued by mechanized intelligence."
3,"The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party.","This is David Bowie's first ""rock"" album, and his second album overall. That first album cast him as a Bob Dylan wannabe, and the less said about it, the better. Recorded several years before the title track became a hit in the U.S., Space Oddity marks the emergence of a different beast, a slippery rock & roll chameleon. Aside from the alien resonance of ""Space Oddity"", the album flounders amid indistinct writing and playing. The album does have it's moments, especially on ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"", ""Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud"" and ""Memory of a Free Festival""; but Bowie is still trying too hard to emulate Dylan, rather then developing his own style. A decent album, but better things came later from Bowie."
2,Fashion Model Santa's Daughter?,"I'm sorry but Jenny McCarthy is not who I expect for Santa's daughter. Plot was lame: daughter tries to 'high-tech' her father's (Santa's) operation and things get screwed up; predictable love triangle between old (good) boyfriend and new (bad) boyfriend. Not funny. Ok to watch once as a rental, but not worth buying, IMHO."
5,Santa Baby,This movie may be a bit cheesy but it is fun to watch. It arrived sooner then I expected. In great condition.
2,WYCLEF SCREWED HIM,"The only good song on this cd in knockout k.o. besides that, all the beats are weak. the reason is this, u dont get a producer like wyclef who is not a hardcore rapper to do a hardcore rappers beats like canibus. it just wont flow right. dont bother getting this cd. just burn knockout k.o. on the other hand i have already heard the whole new canibus cd and it is off tha hook! dj clue did a good job and i give that 5 stars."
4,great blues sound,"A friend bought this record more than 10 years ago and let me tape it. Although that tape is long gone and I haven't talked to him in about the same amount of time, I still remember her name. Doesn't that say it all?"
4,The required headline or summary of my review,"Uecker's book is hilarious. I have loved it for years and decided to buy another copy while I could still find one.Product(s) arrived in a timely fashion in the advertised condition. I would do business with the seller again.I, Top Reviewer Ranking: 12,966,132 , have spoken. There. How's that? Now let go of my sleeve, you vile beancounter. (Not you, darling - I was referring to the Amazon slave driver who insists on words and not just stars and a certain number of them at that and only then specific ones and we have to stand up straight and not answer with our mouths full and we hate them and hope they trip and fall down the stairs at their earliest opportunity, don't we? Yes.)"
4,Very Funny Basball Memoir,"From my childhood, I recall seeing Bob Uecker all time on those Miller Lite commercials. And I continue to quote his, ""I must be in the front row..."" to this day.Anyone who knows anything about Uke, knows he is a very humorous indvidual. He also had an interesting career as a back up catcher for the Braves, Phillies and Cards.This book details Uecker's years in the minors, majors and after baseball.His sense of humor is apparent throughout this one. There were many out loud laughs and chuckles in this book.If you love baseball and need a laugh, read Catcher in the Wry. Bob Uecker, the master of mediocrity, really shines in this one!"
1,better off using electrical tape,"They look awful. I should have paid attention to someone else's review. Yes, they do look like electrical tape. I ended up giving them away."
3,"The B Vitamins don't belong, unfortunately.","It's OK, if you drink it immediately. If it sits for more than a couple minutes, the B vitamin taste comes out rather unpleasantly.I recommend Emergen-c."
3,"I love Zelazny, don't like Dick, gonna quit reading Dick now","A disclaimer: Like a previous reviewer, I will read anything Zelazny wrote, because he's a true master. Amber! Lord of Light! Amazing stuff. He died far too young.Philip K. Dick, on the other hand, doesn't float my boat. I've read three of his books now, and didn't like any of them. I'm gonna quit. I should have quit before this one.Bottom line: If you loved Canticle for Liebowitz and Lord of Light, you'll like this. I loved Lord of Light, but Canticle is as far as I want to go into questioning Christian theology, so this one gets three stars, mainly for Zelazny's influence."
2,What a conflict!,"When this one came out I would (and still would) buy anything by Zelazny and avoid anything by Dick, so I was truly conflicted. I bought it, and I could tell exactly who wrote what and loved the good parts and hated the rest. I wish Zelazny had spent time with someone more useful (Jack Vance would have been an ideal candidate).This sounds unkind, but perhaps this was a charity act like the oft-chronicled donation of ideas by Robert Heinlein."
4,Good Introduction To Glyconutrients,I am reviewing the second edition of THE MISSING NUTRIENTS which is recently revised and expanded to include new information and graphics. Dr. Nugent appears to be very knowledgeable about his subject and this small book is packed with useful information. The author's main theme is that our modern diets are sorely lacking in nutrition and consequently there is a clear need for dietary supplements.Even a strictly organic diet is not sufficient.The most important supplements are glyconutrients. Nugent discusses glyconutrients in great detail and makes a strong case for the addition of glyconutrient supplements to everyone's diet.I recommend THE MISSING NUTRIENTS to anyone seeking a basic introduction to the topic of glyconutrients.
3,a fascinating little film,"This is a fascinating little film to catch. It's an Indian production that imitates every cliche of American mad slasher films of the 1980's. All the cliches are here- a killer, in clown get-up, targeting pretty young college girls. EVERY cliche is here, even down to the bit where our heroine hears a stange noise in her deserted house, and it turns out to be a cat. But, what makes the film interesting are the Indian characteristics. Unlike American genre films set in colleges, the students here are VERY SERIOUS about studying. There is no sex, women are not seen as sex objects (They are seen as second class citizens here.) The biggest culutre shock is the scene at the Indian frat party. The students are thrilled over the only beverage avialable- Pepsi."
1,Unavailable,I would love to write good things about a product if I could get one. Ordered in June and scheduled delivery date move 4 time to sometime in October.
5,Buena Bachata...,"This is a great CD for those of us who love the beat and pace of bachata. There are some beautiful love songs on the CD plus one reggetone/bachata combo that reveals another side to this duo, still enjoyable. Driving in Austin is stressful. For those of us who use music to 'calm' our road-rage tendencies, bachata fits my bill. It's great to add these voices to my 'goin' down the road' audio library."
4,For Todays homebuilder,"If you are looking for old traditional Adobe home plans this is not what you are looking for. Other than, this is a very interesting book, very useful in where to get things done."
1,Not worth the trouble,"This product did not work as described. Sometimes the tabs would not detach from the roll. other times two would come off at the same time. by the time i got to the fourth corner of the photo, one would inevitably have fallen off. May be ok for doing the occasional photo album but it was a pain using these to mount pictures on mats. Double sided, acid free tape worked much better and faster for me."
1,Horrible quality,I normally purchase the 3m brand and they work wonderful. I bought two boxes of the Pioneer brand today at Joanns Fabric and they are horrible. They do not even stick two sheets of computer paper together strongly. Do not recommend the Pioneer Brand :(
4,Functional and goodlooking,"Love the fact that this step stool, unlike others I've used, doesn't teeter when folded up because the legs are equal length. Be warned, though, that the photo on amazon's website is somewhat deceptive. The actual stool is orange (rather than red as shown). Also, the top steps look slanted in the photo, which isn't the case. My only criticism is that it takes a little work to open/collapse the stool. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln very much enjoys the product."
3,Okay for less than $5,"I bought 2 of the red and one black based on the positive reviews. If I'd been in a store and looked at them as clearance items, I would have passed on them. The color is pretty but they are very thin and look like a less than $5 item. I agree w/ one reviewer who commented since they are acrylic that hand washing in Woolite would suffice vs. the expense of dry cleaning."
1,Becareful,"I bought this for my intrepid. Even though it says it fits for my car, but it doesn't. It is too wide."
5,Laugh out loud book!,"This is a hilarious, laugh out loud book that my wife and I love. It incorporates different life-with-kids situations with wit, honesty, and Christian principles. I highly recommend it."
5,HOODWINKED PART 2,"I love Hoodwinked 2! This a good Sequel!The movie is not that bad of a cartoon movie.There are bad sequel that have no action,humor at all.This movie have some action and some humor but not too much as the frist one did but good!Thats better then nothing!"
3,Younger audience will like it,"When the original came out it had a different spin on this fairy tale story and it was interesting. I rented the movie with my young son in tow and the clerk told me. ""This is not a kids movie."" The sequal is definately a kids movie. My now eight year old son loved the action parts. My husband and I were bored. At one point I had to get up and I said: ""Please don't stop the movie for me."" If you like movies like Over the Hedge, this may be a good movie for you. For us this sequal fizzled."
3,It's ok but not magical,"I really liked the first one, but this one doesn't have the same funny moments the other one had. It's a very cute movie but wasn't very good."
3,Not as good as the first,"Hoodwinked Too - Hood vs. Evil, is an interesting expansion on the lovable first movie Hoodwinked. It was designed to be entertaining to adults but still accessible to children - much like the beloved Shrek series. Unfortunately, the second movie in this series is entertaining, but has the feel of cheap direct to video, follow-on film. The kids enjoyed it (especially my 10 year old daughter) but have not watched it repeatedly."
1,SOOO disappointed!,"Wow! The first Hoodwinked is one of our families favorite all time movies - we've watched it many, many times. We were very excited when the sequel was announced and could not wait to see it. My first clue to the disaster we were about to witness was when we were the only people in the theater as the movie began. I can not remember being as painfully bored with a movie in my life, which only made the disappointment worse. I have to admit being a tad angry at the makers of this movie as I felt taken advantage of. It will be a while before I can get the bad taste out of my mouth and enjoy re-watching the original. Save your money and your time - avoid this movie!"
3,Very predictable,"Hoodwinked II sets fairy tales on their side. Not all good characters in the story are good in Happily Ever After and not all bad characters in the story are bad in Happily Ever After. But you are not always told who is who. But the problem is that it is very obvious what is happening and who is good and bad.The only really fun thing about this movie is Hayden Panettiere's Red Riding Hood. This is very reminiscent of her Cheerleader in Heroes.Now I did not see the first film and maybe this dove tails into that film but I cannot say. So if you have not seen the first, then pass."
5,Fun Movie!,"My seven-year-old boys really enjoyed this movie! We didn't see the original ""Hoodwinked"" movie, so I wasn't sure if we would be able to follow this one. But we had no problem understanding the characters or the plot. The movie started with plenty of action, which got my boys interested right away, and they stayed interested all the way to the end. This is a clever and fun family film that everyone will enjoy!"
1,Crack and leeak after 1 year of use,"This machine worked well, and produced nice distilled water.After 1 year of use, I let it sit for about 3 weeks without using it. When I filled it up again with water, the water leaked on the counter. I noticed a long crack on the inside, going from the top to about half way down. It had rust around it.This unit was left stationary on the kitchen counter, and nothing could have caused the crack besides aging. After only 1 year, being used barely once a week, this makes my distilled water very expensive indeed.From reading other's LONG TERM user's reviews, I can surely say that this machines do not last more than 2 years, if you are lucky."
5,An Excellent Distiller,"I have been using this daily.The unit it well designed, the water tasted perfect.Takes about 4 hours for one gallon.No leaks, no escaping steam.I use the water for everything from baby food mixing, to coffee.Stainless steal carafe is very easy to clean.The plastic pitcher does smell like well ... plastic, but if you clean it properly and air it out for a little bit its fine."
5,"Good Investment for clean water, pays for itself","My order was shipped quickly, and the product is great. After 15 uses, it pays for itself in comparison to buy $1 16oz bottles of water. I hope one day I can hook it up to a renewable energy system, (two sunforce 400w wind turbines, or a couple of solar panels could do the job). I was very pleased to see in the instruction manual that it even removes radioactive elements (radium plutonium) from the water."
1,lancome,doesn't live up to it's description - does not matify. that's the reason for which i purchsed it. used it quite few times. the weather's not even hot and steamy yet but it just didn't work.
4,solid for working at 3 foot height,"This scaffold held my weight (230 pounds) at three feet with no problem. Did not sway or wobble. Great for painting tall walls, allows you to move 4 feet across before moving. Moves easily and weighs little. Glad I had it."
4,Liked this very much,I love Sydney Sheldon his books keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the reading.The intrigue will surprise you at every turn.
3,Interesting Portrait,"Given the time it was written, and the delay after the events described, this memoir from the sister of the nation's first Presidential Assasin provides a useful, if inevitably incomplete, account of his fateful devotion to the cause of the Confederacy."
4,A great album...,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this album, but I have to say that it is diverse, original, and damn good. Labrie sounds awesome, and the album weaves through many different styles to create something interesting and engaging."
5,a classic,"This was a gift and became my first Lorna Ballian book. She is my favorite children's author. I read it to my children many, many times and now have to read it to my second graders. Just like my own children, they say, "" Read it again!"". Like many of Lorna Ballian's books, another story is going on in the illustrations.Watch that bear! Children love those tricks she plays in the illustrations!"
4,Keep your eye on the bear.,"What a fantastic children's story. The illustrations are fabulous. This is certain to become a Christmas classic in many homes. I read this with my child and he loved it, couldn't get over the pictures. Very well written."
2,"OK for designing questionares, poor at tough techniques","The book spends too much time on developing a questionaire and what errors you can have in sampling a population. Then in the factor and discriminate sections the books blows throught it too quickly and doesn't explain the difference between determining attitude vs. behavior differences. Not a good book for non-MBA people, even as a class textbook it wasn't so good."
3,Duddy Kravitz wears down with time-don't we all,"Recently saw and then read Barney's -saw it was by Mordechai Richler, started to talk with my wife about this book/ movie, she'd never seen it.We got it(pristine copy, reasonably priced) and greatly enjoyed seeing a lot of YOUNG actors-I loved it, but the other 3 people watching repeatedly called it""dated"" and ""slow"". I thought it was excellent, and got both Richler(Pulitzer Prize winner) books."
5,Passion/Chutzpah,"Yanky brings to light what all folks who have asked themselves the question ""do I have what it takes to strike out on my own as an entrepreneur?"" Do you have the fire in the belly? The passion in the pit (of your gut) The real guage of success is if you can make the adjustment from the security of the world of traditional 9-5 work (ladder world) to the land of freedom. Yanky's book makes you ask yourself the critical questions. I have witnessed this book's ability to change peoples lives.I recommend it highly, and if you ever get the chance to see Yanky in person, don't pass it up you will be impacted and enlightened by the experience."
4,Wonderful,Bewitched is one of the best sitcom's and this video has some of the highlights. Could do with having a longer tape though..more episodes please.
5,Track Info on This Item,"On This CD:1. Christian August Jacobi: Der Himmel Steht Uns Wieder Offen -19:142. Johann Joseph Fux: Alma Redemptoris Mater - 4:223. Johann Heinrich Schmelzer: Venite Ocius, Transeamus Usque in Betlehem - 10:014. Jan Dismas Zelenka: Pro Quos Criminis - 7:335. Anonymus ('Di H'): Cantate Domino Canticum Novum - 10:10"
2,McGRAW-HILL COULD DO A LOT BETTER!,"If you need to know how to pronounce ""telescope"", its here. But no definiton. And no entry for Maksutov or any other type of telescope. Many satellites and asteroids are here, but very few star names. I guess they are too hard to pronounce. All the constellations appear to be here but not the possessive forms which can be tricky to pronounce. Solar activity, solar day, solar max, solar month, solar sail, and hundreds of other simple terms are here but nothing on interferometry. You get the idea. This book would be of very little help while reading a history of astronomy or a book on telescopes or even an astronomy periodical. For some one like me who has been an amateur astronomer for 40+ years and lives far from population centers this book is a disappointment. I still have trouble with many pronounciations and was hoping for some help. This book is a start, but you will need help from many other sources."
1,Hyperbin is worthless,"This product is a joke, not at all what I expected. The lining ripped in about 10 seconds, it came out of the stitching that attaches it to velcro, which attaches the lining to the bag. When I tried to undo the velcro, it remained attached, but the lining blew right out of the stitching with virtually no force. It's ultra cheap material, a plastic bag not much better than what you'd bag groceries in. The zipper is extremely flimsy and feels like it will blow out at any moment. Shoddy materials all around, terrible stitching (the stitch count is very low, meaning it's 5 per inch when it should be closer to 12), really, do not buy this for your dog's food. I'd give it 0 stars. It is clear they wanted the cheapest possible product at the highest possible margin, taking a page from the Walmart playbok.I am returning the hyperbin immediately."
1,Not a pair,"This product would be great, if, they came as a pair of hooks with wheels. As it comes, however, as a single item, it is not adequate to move a ladder by itself. The cost, which is not insignificant, indicated to me that I would receive a pair of hook and wheels, and a review from a subscriber blatantly told the readers that they came in pairs. That was why I ordered a set, I thought. I returned mine."
5,Terrific Product,"I have a very steep roof and there was really no way to get up there short of tethering on like a rock climber. Using this product was much easier and safer. Keep in mind you do need two of them and I used two safety lines, one for me and one for the ladder. Without the ladder hooks I am sure I would still be trying to figure out how to paint the upper portion of my house."
3,Use a ladder stand-off (bull horn),"These are steel and add a lot of weight to a ladder. After getting the ladder onto the roof the wheel is very nice and weight is not so much an issue.Before I found this, I used a werner ladder stand off (bull horn), lighter, more stable, padded ends. It's a very versatile product and worked great. It just needed a roller to aid in getting it in position, but I made do.Every description on multiple websites for this brand and others say they come as a single item, BUT the manufacturers recommend 2 of these hooks for safety, but they only sell them as single items not in pairs. If 2 are necessary, then sell 2, not 1!Apparently people just buy things without looking at them and studying the specs/descriptions. The $20+ price for a manufactured piece of steel plus a swivel wheel is fair and then add shipping and retailer mark-up to be in business. Quit whining and sending jobs to China. You should've read descriptions."
1,damaged product,"The product quality was good, the problem is that I ordered it as a Christmas gift for someone who had been wanting to buy this item for quite a few years, but could not afford to do so. I ordered it as a surprise. By the time I got the item it was a couple of days before Christmas, too late to send it back for a replacement. The spoons arrived damaged. I gave them some of the product so they would not be disappointed. I am stuck with the rest of the damaged product.After inspecting the spoons very carefully I determined that the damage was not due to shipping but rather, faulty inspectin before shipment. All- be- it, someone else may have over looked the chips on 28 spoons and used them anyway, I am not that person.Is there any information available to pass on to me, about how this company will deal with my situation? There remains an unuseable portion of this order. Please instruct me on the matter."
3,Broken Spoons,"This product arrived in about 6 individually wrapes stckes of spoons.Two to three spoons on each end were broken.I bought them for a very reasonable price, so I just let it go.I am using them for a class on Accupressure (Gua Sha) Scraping"
2,Not even solid research can save this,"While I admire Mehta's brave plunge into the underworld his research seems to have no final conclusion. Maximum City is nothing but a string of obervations strung together with none of the brilliant analysis of, say, Naipaul or Dalrymple. My patience finally wore out with the section on ""Monalisa"" - a totally uninteresting, narcissistic bar girl of limited intelligence. Unable to explain why he wanted to know ""why she cut herself"" Mehta falls back on a bunch of ""hooker with a heart of gold"" cliches that would have done justice to the corniest Bollywood production. Face it Suketu: you just thoguht she was hot."
3,A good 300-page book...,"...trapped inside a 500-page book. Like the blurb says, Maximum City explores Bombay's underbelly, with stories of gangster life, the sex trade, the movie business, politics and other shady pursuits. It should have been a recipe for seedy fun, but sadly Mehta is that guy you get cornered by at the party. You know, the one whose anecdotes are a little too long; who forgets the punch line to the three-minute joke; who is interesting, but not quite as interesting as he believes himself to be. And my goodness, I don't even know who half these people are, but even I can tell that Mehta is dropping way too many names. Maximum City is full of bloated stories that would have soared at two-thirds the length. What with 18 million people in Mumbai you'd think Mehta could have found a good editor. I thought Maximum City was an interesting but flawed book. I'm glad it was written, I just wish it had been written a bit better."
2,painfully long and pointless!,"this book is interesting, don't get me wrong... but the author really went overboard with the length... it's too long... it's divided into two parts: power and pleasure. Power is interesting, but i was looking forward to the second part. I thought it would concentrate on the social aspects that make Bombay the city that it is... religion, food, tradition, etc. All I got was 200 more pages that centered on several characters who are not special at all...It ended up bothering me, how he dedicates such a long part of the book to this dancer that he calls ""Monalisa"", when there is nothing extraordinary or remotely interesting about her... complete waste of time...I don't understand his infatuation with her.The endless stories about his experiences in Bollywood are boring as well. Very disappointed...It would have been a good book had it been only 200 pages long.Sorry Suketu!"
1,Uttter rubbish,"Mr. Mehta has lost the plot. He returned after 21 years to find the city different. What did he expect? I mean seriously...Heck I returned after 3 yrs and found a massive difference. The character of the city is such that it constantly keeps evolving. Was New York the same 21 years ago? Mr. Mehta is a gifted writer - it's not how he writes but rather what he writes that is important. And he writes utter crap - you can't possible raturn to a city after 21 years and say ""Oh boy! It's not how I left it!"" Some authors love potray the negative aspects of India cause it pleases the western reader - they empathize with him. Bombay has its share of flaws. I'd rather live here than anywhere else."
4,First Time User,"I've never sewed a day in my life, but I always wanted to try so about a year ago I finally went to the local Walmart and bought this. It was the cheapest there (less than a hundred).It's really easy to use. Never using a sewing machine before, I felt like a pro.Easy directions to thread the needle, and all those different sewing possibilities. It was great!Perfect for beginners!"
4,Seeing through the eyes of Lacey,"MHC makes us experience through the mind's eye the hardship of someone who is running away and hiding from a stalker determined to eliminate. Strength, wit and determination are needed in order to survive the ordeal. It makes you feel bad for the people who constantly live in fear. This is an exciting read - and I simply had a hard time putting it down"
2,Predictable,"In the past I have truly enjoyed MHC's books. Perhaps by now her story patterns have become too predictable: single girl has information of use to a criminal, which handsome man vying for her affection can be trusted? This was pretty dull."
1,Not so good -- stupid behavior,"The main character is presented as someone who isreally smart: figures out complex relationships in the sparse evidence, good memory, ... If she didn't, there would be no plot.She makes every stupid move you can imagine, thus avoiding catching the bad guy throughout the book.I couldn't finish this book."
5,Best Ever,This is the best Mary Higgins Clark book I have read so far. It kept me trying to figure out the plot throughout the entire book. There were several good stories/plots going on at the same time. I really enjoyed the book.
2,Amateurish effort.,"This was a quick, easy read. Unfortunately, Clark seems to have no faith in her readers, feeling the need to smack us in the face with the clues. This was a very predictable book - predictable plot, predictable addition of characters and their actions, predictable outcome. Because of her hamhanded treatment of the clues and red herrings I knew immediately what would happen. A bit more finesse might have kept me guessing until the end. She never even explained how and why the conveniently placed villains (police dept, restaurant) reported to each other. I was disappointed she never tied up loose ends. Other novels of hers are better, but perhaps try another author!"
1,"Either pretend you don't see her, or still watching....","For almost twenty years, this writer has used fomulated receipe to write simplified so-called thriller for simple-minded fragile readers to get goose bumps for no obvious reasons; if you feel like nail biting, contact your family doctor and elementary school teacher. All her books are almost the same; either still watching after twenty year since falling out of the cradle, or gradually turned into a typically formatted across-street scenario; somebody's still watching, but you could be pretending not seeing yet. Same formula like S.Grafton's books, when A to Z are used up, what's next? This one, as usual, a quick flip-through and bore-to-death read (sigh...)"
3,scary,"This book absolutely terrified me. The part that didn't scare me was boring, but the rest was very, very good. I couldn't help but give it a 3. It deserved it for the freaky part. It had me looking over my shoulder for a while there."
3,The Plot Didn't Go Anywhere,"I am 13 and I have read many of MHC books. There hasn't been one I haven't liked. This book in my opinion was just a wild goose chase that lead nowhere until the very last 10 pages. When she was in Minnesota nothing happened there...Her worst book so far-get it from the library, don't buy it"
4,"Great author, another great book.","I am a recent college graduate and before my graduation did not read books for leisure that were not text books, class books, etc. I found this book exciting and well-written. I love MAry Higgins Clark and also loved this book!"
2,What?,"I was very disappointed in this book. I usually enjoy Clark's novels, but this one was sort of a drag. It had a weak plot with even weaker characters. The romance aspect between Lacey and Tom seemed very forced. I wasn't engulfed but the story and plot like many of Clark's novels have done to me. I suggest All Around the Town. I found that novel much more interesting. This book was just dull. Nothing spectacular. Predictable, and very longwinded. I do not recommend this book."
1,Don't do it!,"The Krause ladder I thought was the best I ever used. I had it for 5 years with trouble free use. It got me everywhere I needed to get to. I Maintained it better than what the manufactures specs. Then it failed me. I was up on it for about 10 mins. then I repositioned it to get closer to my work with out touching any of the mechanisms. All of the sudden one of the sections decided to open and throw me thru a large window and break my foot. Needless to say I am now a proud owner of a little giant ladder. Everyone I work with had one and I said no mine was fine until it failed me. They had their ladders for 15 years without incident. So really research, talk around with others before buying this particular product."
5,Phenomonal dance album!,"Ok, kate ryan has had a CD out for sometime now, I had the priviledge of picking it up not too long ago, I have now placed this CD in my top ten playlist permanantly, all dance fans owe it to themselves to snag this CD NOW. From the opening track to the ending track, pure aural pleasure! Get it now!"
3,This is definitely not for amateurs.,"This book covers alot of information from finishes to selecting your materials, how ever when it come to the step by step do it yourself, if you don't have a clue about woodwork then this is not the book for you, if you are a professional, it may be of great value. Guess what! i am a amateur! laterz folks."
2,Save your money and don't buy this book,"This book is old school and is way outdated as far as making cabinets. This book is very hard to follow and laid out very poorly. If you want a good book to make cabinets look into ""Building Kitchen Cabinets"" UDO SCHMIDT"
2,Disappointed,"I read the first chapter before getting this book and I liked the way the heroine was able to laugh at the situation. Unfortunately, that seemed like the only light place in the book. There was so much angst here! Erin was very immature and a tease and I never could understand why Nathan wanted to spend any time with her. The fact that Erin was going to try to raise a baby without any help (and without much forethought) was scary. Not reccommended."
2,The title should be 49 knits and 1 crochet pattern,"If you like to knit, this is your book. They had some cute patterns, however, I don't knit. I don't have the patience to knit. Only one pattern was crochet, it was a pretty shawl pattern that I could have gotten anywhere without spending the money on this book."
3,Good patterns for knitting only,"I was disappointed that it had only one crochet pattern, and not one that I would make. The knitted patterns are beautiful and well done. Would recommend for knitted only."
3,"LOVE the story, dislike the illustrations!","First of all, I love Diane Redfield Massie, and so does my son. If you can get a hold of ""Good Neighbors"", published in 1972, do so, as it is a wonderful story that we read again and again, and a great intro to her work. Redfield Massie was the principal oboist for the Honolulu Symphony, and she began writing children's books for her own brood. I can understand all the interest in reprinting this book, and making it larger than the original, as it was quite small. Also, I should say that ordinarily I love Stephen Kellogg, but well...YUCK! These pictures are garish and scary and sadly, they completely detract from the gentle and charming good humor of the original. My son has been waiting and waiting for the book to come. He was so excited to see it, but now that it is here, I'm disappointed. I will look for a copy of the tiny, lovely one we had as kids."
2,"""Distinctly Average""","Having bought the first one and being disappointed I hoped the second attempt would be slightly better. I was wrong. I found this book to be rather bland and severely lacking in detail. It covered too many episodes in too few pages and, to me, a fans' episode guide to a television series should be more than half a page of synopsis and a 5 second interview with a cast member with some random behind-the-scenes drawings and photographs shoved in to fill the back pages. Just like most other ""official"" guides to television series, it was too brief and not worth the 10.99 or so that I paid for it.If, like me, you expect a lot more information and detail from an episode guide, I'd recommend ""Beyond the Gate"" by Keith Topping. Much less official with much more thought put into it."
1,This product emits really bad chemical smell.,I bought this product for my 6 and 7 yrs old nephews. I am very disappointed about the bad chemical odor that this product is emitting. I have left this product out in the patio for 2 days but the bad odor has not gone away. My nephews are very disappointed because they cannot play with it. The smell is so bad that it fills up the room when I try to bring it back into the family room. I have to move the product back into the patio hoping the odor will go away.
3,Franklin Sports 6-in-1 Table,"The table came within two days of ordering which I was well pleased. However, the condition of the table was a disappointment. My husband spent two days putting the sports table together something that should only have taken an hour or two. Screws were stripped out leaving the screws very loose and protruding, so the screw holes needed to be refilled and rescrewed. One of the wooden end plates of the table was cracked and had to be glued and clamped. And lastly, one side groove for bottom game board was not cut long enough and had to be chisled out so the table would fit together properly. Thank goodness my husband is handy with tools and had enough time to finish it before Christmas. My grandson is only 7 and hasn't noticed anything wrong with the table, the whole family is still having fun with it. All and all it is a good table with lots to do and is quite sturdy if only it arrived in better condition."
1,POOR Quality - Not worth the inexpensive price,"This table is extremely poorly made. We were barely able to assemble it. It wouldn't hold up for one week with active play. The life expectancy of this table is not worth the money. You don't even get what you pay for - it's cheap but won't last long enough to be worth the $120 or so it costs. I'd rather pay more to get a quality game table that will last. This one will be in the dump before the end of the year. After this experience, I don't recommend purchasing game tables on-line. I'd rather inspect them in person first to test the craftsmanship."
2,NOT an outstanding Bowie album. Don't dissapoint yourself!,"Yes, there are a few really good tracks on the album; Fascination, Fame, and maybe Young Americans. His duet with Lennon on Across the Universe is good. But, to the Bowie enthusiast who likes such masterpieces as, ""The Man Who Sold the World,"" and ""Hunky Dory,"" this album is a real bummer. It's probably a necessary transition album for better things to come because ""Station to Station"" and ""Low,"" that were made after, are brilliant. Skip this one. There are too many other Bowie albums that are worthy of buying."
3,Far flung funk,"3 1/2YA may not be exemplary of Bowie's most innovative instincts, but still has enough production savvy and charismatic arranging to excel as one of his more agreeable earlier albums."
2,"Worst of the ""Classics""","This is easily the weakest Bowie album from his 70's heyday. Other than the hits, there really aren't any good - or even passable songs on here.Check out Diamond Dogs or earlier or Heroes/Lodger/Scary Monstersif you want a more challenging/rewarding experience."
3,Un buen disco de soul,"""Young Americans"" es una de los discos más personales de David Bowie. En él no intenta sorpender al público sino ir hacia algo más ""standard"". Se trata de un álbum más digerible, pero no por ello al que hay que dedicarle menos atención. Las canciones son para escucharlas y sentirlas. Puede ser que no sea lo más brillante de Bowie, pero abundan temas notables como ""Young Americans"", ""Fame"" (a dúo con John Lennon) y la conmovedora (hasta las venas) ""Across the Universe"" (sí, la de Los Beatles, también con Lennon). Recomendable."
5,"Get it for ""Fame"" and ""Fascination""","...(with it's Lu Vandross heavy vocals), but check out ""Right"", ""Across the Universe"" and ""Somebody Up There..."" and kick yourself in the pants for not gettin' into Bowie's ""Young Americans"" 'long ago..."
3,A good deal,"Needed it for a college course, much cheaper then the bookstore on campus. Arrived in a timely fashion as well."
1,Bad quality.,"I found it to be very slow even when printing black and white. Three days after the guarantee was up it quit, was quoted $300.00 to fix it."
1,JUNK,I9900 IS JUNK JUST LKIE EVERYONE ELSE I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME TRYING TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY AND NOW IT WILL NOT TURN ON. DON'T BY THIS.
5,three months and still WOW,"It's not easy to drop 400 clams on a printer but you often get what you pay for...and this one is great. I use it only for photo printing in trio with my Canon 30D and L lens. From 4x6 to 13x19 the quality is sweet. A $10 a pop, replacing individual colors is not cheap but at least I can change specific colors as needed, rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water. BUT it's not like I'm running out of colors after only a few prints. No regrets."
5,"WOW!!! The print quality, speed and clarity are outstanding!","I have owned this printer for about 2 months now and it is AMAZING! The quality of the prints from my nikon d70 and this printer is simply unbelievable. The 13x19 prints are great. This printer is quiet and fast too, when I first used it i thought it was broken because I could not hear it and then a minute later there was a borderless 8.5x11 print. For anyone who has images that are high enough resolution to deserve this excellent printer, buy it! You will not regret it!"
2,One major problem,"I didn't really have a problem with this printer until I started printing pictures with a lot of black in them. There seems to be a lot of faded stripes across each picture that can't be eliminated with a nozzle clean. Since I've started to print more dark pictures with black in them, this printer is basically worthless to me. I'm currently looking for a different printer."
4,COLOR PRINTER,This printer prints excellent and quality pictures that are stunning. The only problem I have with it is its size. Too big. I would have rated it higher if it were not for the size.
4,Worth It,"Very stable, easy to use, and reliable. I bought this to replace an old printer that I used to print 11x17 sheets of paper. The old printer kept grabbing multiple sheets per print. This printer can take one sheet out of a large stack of paper without fail. It is more than the HP counterpart, but it will not let you down."
1,A little scary,"These seem fine if your work only takes you up 5 to 10 feet. After that things get very shakey. My set needed repair straight out of the box and left me 15 feet up a couple times because it refused to move down. Only with a lot of struggle was I able to get it to release and get back to ground level. Spend the money on the better set up, full scaffolding or hire a contractor."
5,The most beautiful piano music ever written,"This album is in my top three all time favorites. Mike Garson is at his most inspired, I think, with JIm Walker."
2,Find some staples,These didn't stay together on their own. Couldn't get a straight angle until I stapled them at the corners. So they're cheap for a reason.
4,Good multi-use ladder.,"I bought this after buying a 2 story house with a loft. I needed a large a-frame ladder, a ladder for stairs, and a ladder for odd positions trying to reach high spots near the vaulted ceiling (I now know why the previous owners never painted up those walls). I was going to purchase a few regular ladders, and all together would have been around $600. I decided to invest in this, and I am glad I did. I works everwhere I needed other ladders at less than what I would have paid for all of them together. And, I'm sure you've guessed by reading the other reviews, it IS heavy. The pre-attached wheels help moving around however."
4,Good Selection,"This was not Hold On Help Is on the Way from the movie, but it was a solid collection of songs. Enjoyed hearing each and every selection. Good overall CD."
4,NOT THE ORIGINAL TRACKS,"This CD could have had 5 stars. This group is amazing. The sound quality of the CD is good. The sound of the band makes you feel that you are listening to live music. However...the tracks are all remixes and not the original songs you have grown to love by this group. The originals are better!!! So if you're trying to find the songs you love by this group, get another of their compilations, as these are all remixes of the original. If you already have their CD's and just want to add to your repertoire of Fruko y Sus Tesos...then it's a GREAT addition!"
5,Spectacular Translation of a Great Poet,"This is the first and long-awaited translation of the renowned Israeli poet Zelda. These are powerful poems: profound, sensual, and deeply spiritual. The beauty of the original is not lost in translation: Marcia Falk's English versions are marvelous! Exemplary translation of an important poet."
5,Power and Size,"This battery grip obviously provides an almost excessive amount of power, but the true appeal and value of it lies in the second shutter release. Adding the other shutter release (plus the other manual buttons) allows the photographer to take pictures with a steady hand from a comfortable position without thinking twice. I haven't had any problems with the unit, and I have to say that it has already paid for itself in the stress it's eliminated."
5,Makes the 350d & 400d much more versatile,"I love this grip! I have big hands but still love the 400d camera body, so this is a fantastic add on. It makes vertical shots so easy and gives you longer Canon battery life (stores 2) or you can use good old coper tops!"
3,on off switch inoperative,"Like the batery grip, however the on off switch is inoperative so I will use the on off switch on the camera top rather than going thru the rat race of returning for a device that is fully operational."
3,Definitely not Swarovski.,"I was disappointed by the ""crystal"" of these rhinestones. They weren't shiny or sparkly enough for what I was hoping to do. However, I shouldn't complain, since they're not Swarovski crystals anyway. They also didn't adhere very well to surfaces because the bottoms were too smooth (I used super glue). If you're gluing them on, make sure you don't get any glue on the tops of the rhinestones, otherwise the glue will dry and leave marks on them (that are impossible to clean/scratch off)."
5,Must have for any GTFO bag,"the mask fits very well and is easy to get on and off, even after tightening and adjustment. mine passed a pos/neg pressure test just fine. I can't tell how old my filters are since it's written in Israeli, but it appears to be brand new."
4,Not too bad,"It is in no way a bad purchase, I just wanted there to be a drinking attachment.All in all, good gas mask."
4,They are exactly as advertised,"We were very pleased to see that this item looked as good as new and were exactly as advertised. We tried them on and they fit properly. Fortunately, we haven't needed to use them but, it's nice to know they are there in case of an emergency."
5,Good quality and awesome mask!,"Purchased this as part of a costume for an upcoming project. It's very good quality, and when attached correctly, will definitely keep your face airtight. You'll get exactly what's shown. The straps are rubber and they are sturdy.One reviewer mentioned there's no instructions, however, anyone who has adjusted a strap can figure this out. You basically loosen the 4 straps and put it over your head. Then pull the loose ends of the straps to tighten as needed. Not rocket science here.Also comes with a rugged filter. The container is a solidly built, perhaps a tin material. It doesn't look like the filters itself are removable."
4,Comfortable,"This mask is very comfortable, as far as gas masks go, and is fairly easy to breathe in (I'm not accustomed to breathing through something, though, so its a little difficult to get used to at first). I don't forget that its on like a few others said, and it does get a bit hot, but I'm not gonna complain, especially since it was so inexpensive- I half expected to be ripped off, but I was pleasantly surprised.I was confused by the tube at first, but later discovered that it was so you can drink without removing the mask.The only thing is, my breath fogs up the goggles- maybe I'm not wearing it tight enough or something- and I can't wear my glasses with it on, which leaves me blind.But those are very minor issues, and it arrived in a timely fashion. All in all, I'm very pleased"
5,Great deal. Great masks.,"Okay, so gas masks are creepy for some people, but the way I look at it, it may save your life someday. These are well-made masks, and come with all the accessories. I think they look great and hopefully they'll work just as good for that day when I need one. Great deal when I got it, too. These things have really come down in price.Do yourself a favor. Get one for each member of your family, store it away in the basement, because you never know when you may need something like this."
5,Great Value!,"This gas mask seems to be a great addition to any military collection of goods. It fits well and it feels like it'll work. I've heard that the filters that they give out are old so you might need to buy a new filter.I just want to say that if you're going to use this for real, you should make sure that you are familiar with the nomenclature of the mask."
5,"Cool item, great prop","Yea, I purchased this for a prop. I shoot a lot of abandoned buildings, and this thing just looks cool hanging around, or on a model. Perfect condition, brand new."
1,Attributed the item and did not return money,Attributed the item and did not return moneyThe deduction from my $ 79 and I do not know why
4,Gas mask/adult/,"Was as advertised,fit fine.. no leaks.. no issues.Yes expired filter but those filters are good long after the date they state on packaging. Zero complaints. Would be 5 stars but had the expired filter. Wont hesitate to order more. Im 6ft 4in and My hat size is7-3/4 and there were no issues with fit...One down side-it, does not work with glasses,but I am OK with this as I knew it when I purchased it."
4,The Balancing Act,"The author, N.Sivakumar performs a balancing act backed up with facts and figures regarding outsourcing of tech jobs to India. The book conatins many funny and interesting personal episodes of the author as well."
3,Not a bad little TV Movie from Canada.,"First off, most everything Cookieman said in his review is true and I won't rehash what he had to say about this movie. I'd just like to add that I thought this movie was entertaining without being ""over the top"" as many post-apocalyptic movies can get.There are no biker-gangs in this film, no road warriors and no bizarre characters like you would normally find in this type genre.The film has a sort of ""this could really happen"" kind of feel to it.If economic collapse or a crop collapse were to occur, I could see this sort of scenario with city people raiding the country farmers playing out in this fashion.This is not a great film, but I enjoyed it for what it is and I am giving it 3 stars. I think it covered the subject pretty well."
3,Not one of Wheelers best books.,"It is a good read maybe if you hadn't read some of Wheelers better books. I have read about half of the book and I dont think I will bother with the rest be cause there are some good books i havn""t read yet and there is only so much life left."
4,FUNERAL DRESS IS A GREAT BAND,"Its a good cd, But i don't like live albums, this ones alright, tracks 7-16 are live. Great Band"
5,A must have ...,"For any girl who knows in her heart that mermaids simply and surely must exist, The Book of Mermaids is a must have. Not only does it confirm everything she always knew to be true, it gives a fantastic view, rippling with romance and realism, into the underwater world that seems only a tail-flick away. From merlore and history to details about merfamilies, merfashions and merfestivals, this book is a celebration of fantasy worthy of a reading during Jewel Time festivities. Beautiful, murky water-colored illustrations give a glimpse into a world we all wish to be real."
1,So disappointed!!,"I ordered this book as a Christmas gift for my great-granddaughter and am greatly disappointed. While the artwork is lovely, the writing is amateurish. There is NO story to it whatsoever, despite other reviews to the contrary. While the writer refers to mermaid legends, she offers no details about the numerous mermaid legends and myths, only a lot of trite, disconnected paragraphs presenting made-up 'information' about mermaid life. If only a little research and effort had gone into the text, this could have been a charming gift for a little girl. As it is, I will be scrambling to find a suitable last-minute present for my great-granddaughter to open on Christmas Day."
1,Terrible,"The Barbie Plug and Play 12 Dancing Princesses thing is a joke. My daughter only wanted that for Christmas for three months. After the one on Christmas morning did not function at all, the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days. The graphics are straight from 1981 and the ""dancing princesses"" even make roboty bendy noises as they move. Very strange and disappointing."
2,Not the greatest,"I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. I was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat, not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. I tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. I threw the box away and I'm sure I need that to return it. If I could I would get her something else in return that she could use."
1,Awful!!!,My daughter just received this as a Christmas gift. She was so excited. My husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it. 15 minutes later my five year old is in tears. I wish this had been reviewed before we purchased. The graphics are terrible. This will be going back to the store. Glad I still have the receipt.
5,"Excellent, but missing the extras!","This was one of my absloute favorite shows growing up and I was shocked to see that the whole season was out. Well I knew I just had to have it. I think it was totally cool of them to put in the original pilot, since a lot of the shows don't include that. How else will we know how it all began? My only complaint is that there are no extras with any of the cast members, just a silly featurette with people who I've never even heard of. I hope that season two will include a lot more goodies than this one did. My advice is that if you're a true fan of this show, the little bit of money that it costs compared to the other shows that are out on DVD is completely worth it to me! Now that I own it I recognize a lot of people who became stars in the 80s that made guest appearances in many of these episodes. Be sure to check it out!"
1,"At Last It's Here, But....","Yes, it has arrived: CHARLIE'S ANGELS on DVD! I am happy that the pilot movie for the series was included as well as a retrospective special. But this is where the joy ends, everyone.I won't automatically award 5 stars for this box set just because it's available. When I read that the episodes had been digitally remastered, I expected a good picture. Instead, each episode looks as though it could have been taped off of TV Land. Apparently, there have been no improvements made. Big disappointment! More care should have been taken to restore such a classic show, especially before a DVD release.The packaging is awful too - flimsy, bare plastic DVD cases, and only a brief fold-out containing the episode credits.It's better than nothing, but disappointing for sure.But since CHARLIE'S ANGELS is here, if only we also had WONDER WOMAN, and THE BIONIC WOMAN as well!!"
4,run free in your dreams,"The beauty of Carol MacLean Carr's ""Fairy Dreams"" surpasses that of most similar books. Each picture in this book is filled with a sense of life and love.""Fairy Dreams"" is essentially a far more beautiful, even lyrical version of the old ""Where's Waldo?"" books.The fairies leave things lying around in each picture. The job of the reader is to pick them out of the background. Such books do not test the knowledge of the reader, but rather the fullness and keenness of the eye. One must ""know"" how to see things skillfully.This is all fine and dandy, but I'd recommend losing yourself in the pictures and words before you go searching for the items. This stuff is just plain eye-popping. Spend some time with it and let your imagination run free.I give ""Fairy Dreams"" a high recommendation."
4,CLOSEST THING TO A CURE!!!!!,"This cream worked so well, within 3 weeks a huge difference in the bumps and dryness on my legs. The within 1 months considerable amount of fading with the brown marks left behind and overall smoothness."
1,Terrible and *not* family friendly movie,"As a Father watching this movie with my family and young kid, I felt insulted watching this movie because it reflects Dad's in poor light and promotes the concept of broken families where parents are separated.I was raised by good parents and I see good Dad's all around me. To show Dads as incompetent and selfish as portrayed by Eddie Murphy should be insulting to all Dad's.The movie deals with a trite adult concept of a 'busy father with no time for kids' in a way that is not appropriate for kids.Further, the movie promotes the idea of broken families with Father and Mother living separately.Hated the movie."
4,good modern hard rock CD,"I like this CD a lot. Shinedown has a talent for writing songs that both get in your head melodically and let you get your rocks off musically. The guitar has a clean, heavy sound to it and I like the singer's voice. Some people complain that the singer goes overboard especially on songs like 45 and Simple Man. My feelings are if you have the pipes, use them, and I'd rather hear someone sing with emotion than sounding bored like some bands do. The CD isn't perfect, I think the drumming is a little pedestrian and some of the songs at the end of the CD aren't as strong as the first half, but overall it is very good. If you're looking for a band to compare their sound to, I think they sound somewhat like Hoobastank, but I feel Shinedown's songs are better."
1,leave a whisper,"worst service ever. dont order new cds if you want a new one, they send used ones. And if you are not happy with the service and send them an email about the problem expect nasty emails from the company in return. He told me not to shop with amazon again."
5,Earlier CD by Shinedown - and it is one of the best ones!,"I just started listening to this band a couple months ago, so I ordered this CD. It may be a few years old, but the songs easily fit into this generation. Some are really heavy, some are softer. The vocals are great. There are about 12 songs on this CD and they are all fabulous."
3,Uneven Disc- Great Vox,"You'd have to call this Radio Metal- guitar-driven, chorus-filled songs with emotional, catchy melodies. The best tunes on the disc are probably the first three, which bristle with imaginative breaks, memorable hooks and passionate vocals. The third, 'Lost in the Crowd', is interesting because it mixes a bit of Doom into a basically radio-friendly song. The tunes grow looser and weaker as the disc wears on, ending with the earnest, but tiresome, suicide ballad, '45'.But if the tunes are uneven, the vocals are not. The singer wails his head off, walking the line between old school metal and Seattle-era grunge with ease. He's a one-man refutation of the dozens of tedious Rap Metal vocalists we've been stuck with for so long. If the disc isn't great, it still has some great songs and a singer that actually sings. I'm interested to hear what these guys do next."
4,Maybe there is hope for music on the radio.,"I first heard 45 on the radio & lIKED IT. Then I heard simple man at first I could'nt stand it , I thought how can they butcher a classic , but the more I hear it the more I like it . This guy can realy sing . Then they played here in Augusta and they rocked our a$$e$ off . I had to buy the CD and dont regret it one bit. Have you listened to the radio , latley the music industry is about as sorry as Hollywood . It is rare now days to hear anybody with anny tallent or skill it's like the record CEO'S tell us this guy is great & they cram it down your throat. These guy's have tallent."
5,Buried Treasure!,"I can absolutely say that is truly a buried treasure in the world of melodic hard rock. This is an incredible album with not one weak song. To me, these guys sound like an amalgam of Saliva, SOiL, and Stereomud with perhaps a bit of Systematic thrown in. Either way this is a fantastic band and will hook you with one listen of their first single ""Fly From The Inside"". But that is only a taste, do yourself a favor and pick up this album, you will not be disappointed!"
4,good CD,"This CD is good. Vocals are great. And I love the song 45. My only complaint is, I buy this freakin' album, and what do they do? They re-release it with three more songs. What about us poor idiots who already bought it? It's just wrong. So now I'm supposed to re-buy an album I already have? Don't think so. Studio is just out for more money. (kind of like DVD's that have the regular edition as a first release, then the special edition a few months later, then the super, extra, platinum edition) Drives me CRAZY!!!!"
4,"Does Cream City mean Milwaukee, Wisconsin?","I was told by a musical friend that Aalon comes from the ""Beer Capital of the World"", hence the title ""Cream City"".The album starts with a tribute to ""Cream City"", it then goes into the ever-popular ""Rock and Roll Gangster"", then leads us into ""Midnight Man"".One of my favorires however, is ""Summer Love"", simply because of the guitar ""scratching"" and the mellow synthesizer sound - perfect music for an afternoon drive down the coast.Another favorite is ""Magic Night"" - Aalon's guitar talent really comes out on this one, along with excellent keyboard support.Aalon's lyrics and vocals on this album are solid.Overall, an album (still) worth its weight in gold."
4,About what I expected,"Decent outdoor patio lighting units. Hardware to open up units for lightbulb replacement is a bit flimsy, but overall the units look good."
3,Israeli M15 test with CS Grenade,Length:: 6:30 MinsMy girlfriend and I test our recently purchased masks off Amazon with a CS grenade.
2,Misleading pictures/description,"These Israeli M15 gas masks are great but this particular item on Amazon is misleading. I purchased from this seller (Fox Outdoor) vs the dozens of others selling this mask specifically because the pictures indicated it was the latest M15 mask with the side voice emitter. I also liked that it came with the standard hydration tube AND a canteen cap according to the product details, most other masks out there only have the tube.Sure enough, I get the masks and they have NO side voice emitter on the mask and NO canteen cap in the package (just the tube and adapter for the mask.Returning the masks now and ordering from another seller. If these details arent important to you then go ahead with this item. If so, look elsewhere."
5,Excellent!,"Taut and intense throughout. Intricate subplots ties together nicely. Well thought out plotting. I liked it better than it's American successor, Next Three Days."
3,"dated & at times impractical, but a good starting point","While the book was published in 1993, it is a compliation of articles that appeared in the magazine Fine Homebuilding,leading up to that point. Thus, you'll find articles from the mid to late 80s. While many of the designs are dated and at times impractical, because of technological improvements since then (and really now, how many people can live in an earth berm house?) The take home message shouldn't be lost in, at times, bizarre approaches: heating the floor via an embedded series of air ducts.Rather, the take home message should be (and is readily apparent with the cross sectional construction drawings) in insulating the home and making it as tight as possible. Because of the excellent photography and the diagrams, I would start here, but certainly not end here. Moreover, for $5, it's not a bad starting point."
2,Not what I expected,"The title is misleading, the book is filled with stories about time travel and only about two pages of How to with little detailed instructions. You can find a lot of books better than this one, for shure."
3,History,The animation was okay. The history account was useful for a history lesson for an older child; I say 8 years and up.
3,"Good, but superficial","Nice, respectful treatment of a true genius, but rather superficial. If this were the first book anyone were to have read about JD, it would not be very enlightening."
3,Worth the price,"I purchased this item for what I thought was an old Marlin 336. Turns out my rifle is a model 30A, so the foregrip was tricky to get on. The buttstock bolted on perfectly, and the foregrip took a little bit of easy drilling. For the price, the product works, and works well. It was pretty much exactly what I expected. The only reason I did not give it four or five stars is because it did not exceed my expectations in any way. It's just a decent stock/grip for the decent price.Took me about 45 minutes to remove the old parts and install the new ones."
4,A quick and healthy way to make pizzas.,My husband and I are happy to have found healthy pizza crusts that we don't have to make from scratch. These taste very good. The reason they only received 4 stars is that sometimes they get moldy very quickly. I hope the company finds a way to package them better so that won't happen anymore.
1,"Not worthy of the ""Book Swap"" section at the library","I have to agree with the other ""one star"" reviewers. I am a military wife of 9 years, and I could not identify with either of the book's two primary characters. It isn't until almost the end that either character even becomes a military wife. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. There were many grammatical and typographical errors--was it even edited?? I normally donate the books I've read to the local library for their swap section--this one went in the garbage. Don't waste your time on this book."
2,A disappointing read,"There may have been potential for a good story in this book. It definitely need more editing though. There were multiple very obvious errors and the characters were often completely unsympathetic. The basic plot wasn't horrible, but all and all this book was a disappointment."
5,dog leash splitter,"This is a convenient product. It's much easier than having two leashes. It's strong and works well. This product arrived a little earlier than it was promised, and it was in new condition like it was meant to be."
4,Timex watch keeps ticking,"I have had Timex watches for a long time, using them for work. They last a long time taking a betting and without changing the batteries. They do what the old ad said they do."
5,Great watch,Great watch! I have had one of these watches for years and I have always been happy with it. Would purchase it again.
4,"Fun, flavorful, and pretty affordable","I was without a watch for awhile, but am thrilled I've found this. I've owned it for several months, and like the gold color coupled with the LED -- it feels kind of 80s retro, like something out of the Miami Vice era.Haven't had any problems with it thus far; it does what it says, tells time, and looks great doing so.On the downside, it's not immediately intuitive to figure out which button does what, but through repeated usage, you'll learn.One notable feature omission: a countdown timer!Aside from that, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
2,Generic and uninspired,"I tend to shy away from books that fall under the banner of ""series."" Many times they contain top notch material, but many times they will slip in mediocre material. Such is the case here. This is a bland volume on Washington. Points are made over and over again, more like a persuasive essay than real scholarship. The word ""obviously"" is used many times to conclude a point. Furthermore, how many times can the word ""undergirded"" be used in a book...? I stopped counting. There are almost a countless number of books on Washington that are better."
1,george washington,"Too many random people quoted giving platitudes. Not much inforfation about washington at all, siblings, children, parents, education, etc. not much else to say. A brief flattering book."
1,"pettty, immature academic view of Washington","Burns and Dunn seem to think ambition is a dirty word, and that one can't have ambitious goals for oneself combined with modesty. Perhaps they've never known modest, hard-driving and successful men - that is, people with outstanding abilities who want to realize their potential and yet are innately modest. So we get the historian picking on Washington, exposing him for a hypocrite, instead of informing us on what contributed to Washington's outstanding leadership and moral qualities. very disappointing. I quit reading after chapter 3."
4,Not as good as the original,"Miracle of MarcellinoI saw this movie as a child, but another version. I purchased this one thinking it was the original. I liked it, but want to purchase the original as this was not quite as good."
3,Thump this!,"Well, I was a little disappointed. I originally wanted the CD for the song, ""Smoke Two Joints"", but with a name like ""Thump'n Reggae Jamz"" I expected the whole CD to be... a little more ""jamin'"" if you know what I mean. But that's just me..."
5,"AWESOME ALBUM, DUDE....EVERY SONG IS CLASSIC!","This is one of the best of the ""best of"" albums you could listen to! Most songs are Marley's, and deservedly so! 4:20......time to kick back and schmoke some weed!Peace Out!"
4,A little surprise,I was expecting an anthology but it is basically just a 3 part story. Enjoyable reading all the same.
5,Heaven-like Schubert,"These are works for musicians of the highest caliber. Schubert's piano sonatas can be celestial or, depending on the interpretation, a succession of painfully disjoined notes. Therefore, let's all take off our hats and humbly thank Murray Perahia for this jewel that honors the music of Schubert in the best possible way."
4,El Ingenuo,"Excelente. Increiblemente actual, un espejo de los absurdos de la sociedad. Una radiografía del poder y la mezquindad de algunos hombres que sucumben ante él y también, un tributo al amor y a los hombres buenos. Muy entretenido y a veces, conmovedor."
1,so bad it`s good,"Review of Miracle Pictures disc. Talk about being made on a shoestring, this movie must have used only half a shoestring. The cast has some good performers but they`re stuck with a terrible script and laughable sets. You can have fun smiling at miniaturized sets and inept dialog. Picture is just fair and sound is good. A curio from the past."
3,The Wisdom of Everyday Matters,"Nardi Campion has written a gem, a witty and wise reflection on a life lived to the fullest. Like any great memoir, it introduces us to a new world, filled with parents and children, triumphs and tragedies, exaltation and despair, with humor, curiosity, and an enduring love constant throughout.This is a book for readers of all ages, any man or woman who treasures thoughtful and clear writing. If you're tired of shallow celebrity driven drivel, this is the book for you. I'm buying multiple copies to give to my family at Christmas.Particularly noteworthy is the book's exceptional coda: an original poem by Stanford poet Peter Martin Campion."
5,Possibly the best Christmas album ever!,"The music on this album serves as the perfect counterpoint to the craziness of the Christmas season. Each selection is an introspective gem. You can listen to it all day long and never tire of it. My favorite is track #7, it has one of the nicest piano arrangements I have ever heard."
3,Winterlude,A wonderful CD--it is very enjoyable and relaxing to listen to. Great service. Received my order promptly. I would highly recommend the CD and Amazon.
5,Terrific music,And there is only one Barbara Cook!!! Worth the price of admission. One of the great musicals that finds itself under valued.
1,damn little comfort and no joy,"Muzak to my ears. Vapid, unimaginative arrangements more suited to department store bargain rooms than the home (not that I like piped in music anywhere). It's got one star because it is not possible to give 0 stars."
1,Mummies and the Wonders of Egypt,"Sorry Friends, I expected more from Egypt or from the producers of this DVD. Those incessantly flowing pictures made me dizzy."
5,Beautiful Watch!,"I find it difficult to purchase online, since pictures never do items justice and you can't get a real ""feel"" for what you are looking at. After days of comparing different watches, reviews, and pictures, I decided on this watch as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.He loves it! It looks great on his wrist, and he has received several unsolicited compliments about his watch. I wasn't there when he set the time, but apparently is was straightforward enough to do quickly and without reading directions (he usually skips that step). I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Really Different.,"This album is cool, but if you don't try to get in and create a mood for it you won't get it. Dim the lights, read the song titles and imagine you're right there with the natives, you'll dig it."
5,Finally a factual guide plus an excellent history,This book combines a complete factual reference guide with a clear and fascinating historical narrative. The photos are excellent; many previously unpublished. Foster is the best Jeep writer out there.
3,Plain Ditsy,"There is no other way to describe this soundtrack other than ditsy. I absolutely loved the movie and it's retro look and feel.I bought the soundtrack for the score rather than the songs, even though Renee and Ewan's song is fun, the score is a blast! It's the third major character in the movie, in my opinion.Not the meatiest of soundtracks but definitely one of the more fun ones out there."
2,Just an OK Film,"This movie was very predictable and used lots of cliches. It was made for TV and you can tell as the scenes wind down for a commercial break (although there are no ads on the Amazon version.). I believe it showed as being PG-13. This show is really a G as there is no foul language, violence or anything else distasteful in the movie. If you want a low budget movie, that is sweet, but not rememberable, this will fit the bill."
5,For the Love of Grace,"I just watched this movie for the first time, and absolutely loved it! Am ordering for my own collection. I will be watching it all through the year. One of the best movies I've seen lately.Clean,wholesome and touching!Recommend it to everyone!"
4,good film,The film was predictable but also enjoyable. Life is always changing and disaster can often alter your view and cause you to focus on what is important
3,It's great Book BUT??,"I think this is great book and helpful to write good resume, but not covered the most important part which the resume covering letter, and I think most of the time the resume covring letter more harder than to write your experinces and your details,,"
3,Laptop Holder Also,"Although the wrong photo is being used in this listing, You are actually getting the small, the photo is of a large. The sizes give in the fine print are correct. However it's still a good product if you would like to stay away from plastic options. We have owned the large for many years and it's still going strong! I purchased this to elevate a Mac-book as it has no solid back and the laptop can get good airflow. It stops me craning my neck to view the screen"
3,Has its moments,"Definitely a weird one. They should have inserted the LSD section at the end, AFTER Rachmael goes to Whale's Mouth. Then it would make more sense, because it's what happens to him when he gets there, not before."
4,"Lies, lies and more lies...","After all, should you believe any review?I rather enjoyed this particular novel, not your usual Philip fare, some psychadelic drugs thrown in here and there- definitely some interesting reflections on WWII, despite them (the ideas) being(now) well known.Final verdict: I recommend it!"
1,time is of value - this book is not worth it,"Since I paid for the book - I finished it. Not worth it. Incoherent story, too many characters with hardly any description, no clarity. Nobody really cares in the end what happens."
5,Long Live Film Cameras,"This is a great film camera. it takes nice picture, has easy to use features, and is easy to carry around. This a good value for the price."
4,I could not have gotten along without it,I used the aluminum extension plank all summer while painting my house. The only issues was the weight which was a lot for one person.
5,32GB in Canon HF100,"No problems in about 5 months with the Canon HF100 camcorder.But be sure to note-- ALL the SDHC cards will *require* an SDHC card reader. They will NOT work in an older SD card reader. (that includes this card, although it's not a fault with the card-- it's the SDHC standard)."
1,Won't Work,"Just got it in, tried on two different camera, both rated to use the 16g SDHC cards. Just got errors. Now I have to go through hassle of returning it. Not the useual PNY quality."
5,Perfect for today's DSLRs,"Yea, bought this card the other day. Says I can take almost 400 Raw+Large pictures on.I went from shooting 500 medium size pictures (6mp) to being able to shoot 400 Large (12.1mp) pics and 400 raw images.Perfect for my canon XSi"
4,Weird compilation,"This album isn't really a ""Greatest Hits"". There are several newly-recorded songs, one from the vaults, and a mishmash of good tunes taken from earlier records. It's always sounded arbitrary to me."
4,tommy turrentine cutout,this cd is awesome i highly recommend it. he is a jazz great like his brother stanley. had the honor of meeting him in 1987 in newyork. heard him play his trumpet personally then. since then i listen to jazz quite a bit.
4,Brain Food for Freaks,"I found this really irritating for the first couple listens... but I kept wanting to hear it again. I want to hear it again right now, but I can't find it. Truly wierd, creative, intense. Better for headphones than driving, but if it's up loud you can drive with it too. Oh, and I think Pixies are to Pere Ubu as Tom Waits is to Captain Beefheart. Which means if you're a Pixies fan (and if you aren't I don't want to talk to you) you'll be interested in this..."
3,Jack Dorsey,I don't know much about this artist but Escape on xm is now playing some of his beautiful music songs.From this song track listing it looks like he also did beautiful christian instrumentals as well.
5,Third brake lite,"I purchased this product site unseen and from the description given. It is everything I wanted, and performs just like advertised. I modified it from a hitch lite to a permenant third lite for my Suzuki Samurai. I love the flame light in blue, and it really lites up when you apply the brake."
4,Not As Bad As You Might Think,"O.k. so Hugh Cornwell leaves the Stranglers. They should have called it a day, right? I think wrong in this case. This release actually has some pretty decent cuts on it. A lot of critics seem to think anything the Stranglers released after thier second or third album was trash anyway and I am not sure why. Actually a lot of the songs contained here harken back to that early Stranglers period and they are pretty good. Favorite cuts: ""Time To Die, Sugar Bullets, This Town, Leave It To the Dogs, and Vicious Circles""."
5,A Great Mystery and a Fun Read,"Leave a Good-Looking Corpse left me wanting more books from James R. Preston. I was completely caught up in this great mystery set in Huntington Beach, California. T.R. Macdonald, intelligent, brash, and very likable, encounters many colorful and believable characters during his adventures. I liked the fact that T.R. is not a professional detective and is learning the ropes as he goes along. It gives the story tension as well as lots of humor. I found myself laughing out loud countless times. Mr. Preston is an awesome storyteller and Leave a Good-Looking Corpse is filled with suspense, intrigue, and a terrific unexpected ending. I read it in a day and a half. (I would have read it in one day, but I forced myself to finally put it down at 2 a.m.) I highly recommend this book; it was a lot of fun to read."
3,A difficult listen...,"What she recorded in the 60s is fantastic, and she's undoubtedly the one opera singer who crossed over into pop successfully, but her pitch problems are abundant here, and it makes this, and in fact, the entire Reference Recordings issues a difficult listen."
3,"Wall Walker Scaffold Device - good idea, needs improvement","The Wing W6-38S Wall Walker Hanging Aluminum Scaffold Device is a good idea but needs to be lengthened to be practical for most workers and for many projects. At 6 feet total length, it hangs on the wall leaving less than 6 feet for head room. Since for many projects (setting trusses, for example) the worker's head would be in the way of the material being worked on, it is not practical. There may be projects for which it is practical, but my carpenters framing a house did not find it useful. They had no complaints about quality. It appears to be well-made. They believe it would be a very useful scaffolding tool if it were two feet longer."
2,"Bland, stolen","Candy says stop stealing Lou Reed's lyrics.I must admit to liking ""Buena,"" but this album, with its horns and airport bar vocals, is cheese city. This album is for the Adult Alternative crowd. That's not entirely true. It's for ironic indie kids with Adult Alternative souls.Shronk!"
4,"If the blues and jazz procreated, you'd get Morphine.","If you're not sure where to start with Morphine, start here. Amazing album from start to finish. Even the sax on the title track somehow escapes being cheesy, despite its 80s wailing. Mark Sandman's voice is sex wrapped in chocolate."
4,Displaced emotions on the floor...,"Entering the realm of Dino Felipe's mind is a challenge.The soundscapes are psychotic and mesmerizing, finding beauty in those stuttering glitches and discovering peace in its chaotic noise. Both ethereal and neurotic, these are not songs but rather pieces of Dino's psyche, watching fire melting in the water, flowing in the stream of reverence and surrender.I believe only true idm listeners will appreciate the skill and art to make music like this. ""Flim Toby"" is a glimpse of Dino's beginning, a witness to his stems growing in the vines, these songs are more like de-structured thoughts without rhythm, without a clear-cut path. Try and make sense of this wonder and gem, and you just might catch a glimpse of Dino's shadow hiding from the sun."
4,Good patterns and book design,"If you crochet or both knit and crochet,you should be pleased with these patterns. The majority are for crocheters and,although the designs are traditional,there are quite a variety. This book is not for people who only knit or are looking for trendy designs because there are few of either. I especially liked the categorization for patterns (e.g., ""easy stripes"", ""timeless classics"")and the spiral binding is great (wish all knit and crochet books would use it).The graphed designs are generally well done. All in all,the book is worth the price."
1,Denise Austin's eye cream,I can not recommend this product. It did absolutely nothing! Don't waste your money.
1,Don't waste your money!,I have tried the method described in this book 5 times. I hopes of having a girl - well I have 5 wonderful boys. The Author of this book needs to research more - her so called system doesn't work. Also look at the Basal chart she says was her own - funny she can write a book but does not know there are only 30 days in June. I feel this book is a waste of your money & just a way for a mother to make money from people like us!
2,Not as good as our first Asus,"Tne motherboard performed very well. I did not make any extreme use out of it.But, once in a while, it would tend to not recognize the RAM, and I would get 4 beeps at post - it would not boot. Was only using 2x1GB sticks, and switching them to the two other channels did not solve the problem. When this happened, the best solution was to open the case and touch one of the sticks, and it would work well again. Cleaning the contacts on the sticks had no efect.I was kind of surprised to see this behavior. We have another Asus motherboard (A78N SLI DELUXE), of about the same price range, which is still going strong after 8 years of use and has never given any problems.Finally, after about two years and 8 months of use, it died. There was no power at all. The diagnostic LED would not even light up.I guess this might have been an odd board."
4,Totally exhaustive!,"I'm glad to finally get my hands on this! The features prove just as I hoped: Enumerates the number of occurences for each entry, and each occurence is paired with a 5-10 word context line. 3 columns per page. Includes 32 key phrases of special theological importance like ""Angel of the Lord"" and ""Children of God"". Includes over 1000 common words in the KJV, and gives their NKJV equivalences. Even includes in the back a list of the 100 most common articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and pronouns (without the context lines).For quality, the book's binding is average, but the pages are thicker than most, using the same amount of paper while containing 300 less pages. Not too much to complain about!"
5,It's a life changer,"This book reaches into your heart and pulls out things you were feeling but couldn't put into words. The ""bondage"" of our sinful nature keeps us from all of the joy God has planned for our lives. This book teaches you through prayer how to get rid of all of that and it's backed by scripture! I can't say enough about this book. God bless all who find and purchase it. Friends and family have noticed a change in me after reading this book!"
1,Boreing,"This is a book about an egotistical, self promoter. If you want to read about how great Cyr believes he is buy this book. You would think this guy was working on the cure for cancer rather than getting people that already want to come to the casino to actually come to the casino.No new stuff here."
5,Quality,"I should have bought this 3 years ago!Every tune is a winner, the music that masters at work listen to. Well put together and a true rare classic."
5,Pearhead Side Photo Album,Great photo album! I love the way that the photos slide easily in and that there is room next to them to put down comments. It also comes with very handy stickers that are technically to be used on the binding to say what the album is for but the extras work really well for labeling the photos neatly in the memo spaces inside! I think I will buy one for every year of my daughter's childhood!
1,This is not what I expected,"The description of the product says that it is for 1,000 pictures. However, when I got it I noticed that it is just for 200 pictures."
5,Great Mix!,"There are a lot of rap compilations out there, but this entire set by TIME-LIFE MUSIC is a great mix of the best old-school rap. They did a great job assembling this set! It's good to have all these old cuts in a single collection. Also, you get the full songs, they are not cut-off mixes by other DJ's. This is where it all came from. These artists deserve serious respect!"
5,I Think I'm Turning Afro-Brazilian!,"Befor this video I thought I knew Afro-Brazilian dance, but I now know how sourly mistaken I was. Vanessa Isaac's dance/ workout film showed me the way. I recommend this video to everyone- both young and old, dancer or non-dancer. Whether you've spent your life in ethnic movement classes, or are just starting out; this video is the one for you. This film transports you from a workout in the studio to an alluring ocean side dance, and back again. It's obvious that Isaac knows what she's doing. This is my favorite dance/ workout video. Vanessa Isaac is a genious!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!!!!,The introduction was very deceiving. It made me feel I was actually going to enjoy this tape. The instructor was too focused on her charms. The dance steps didn't go with the music. It was too slow and boring. There was no afro-brazilian music!!! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
5,fun discovering new muscles!,"This workout is a lot of fun! I love the Brazilian music, the great beats, the moves, and especially discovering muscles I didn't know I had. No wonder Brazilians are so gorgeous!"
2,Disappointing.....,"I am a big fan of Preston and Child. I thought The Cabinet of Curiosities was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I wasn't expecting much of Still Life with Crows and thought that was excellent as well. So, although this is minus Child, I was anticipating the Codex with great excitement. Unfortunately, I was let down.The premise is pretty good, but the story is way too shallow, as are the characters. Most things are fairly unbelievable and the plot just seems get more and more unrealistic as they venture further into the jungle. The love story is completely pathetic. Why even make the love story part of the plot when you are going to devote about 1 full page to developing it, and most of that consists of a sexual encounter in a hut after struggling through the jungle for a week to the point of near exhaustion? I got about 7/8 of the way through the book then decided it was not even worth my time to reach the conclusion.I'm looking forward to Brimstone."
3,Pleasant Afternoon Read,"There is nothing special about this book or the story, but it's a fine read if your at a resort and want something to keep you occupies while you sit on the beach or at the pool. It could even keep you busy on the flights to a from the resort.But as good literature, it's not. There are too many cliches floating around and the characters are all flawed not to mention one dimensional. The idea of a pipe smoking englishman who teaches art history at a north- east college, a new-age hippie looking for nirvanah, and a selfless vet working on an Indian Rez is just too much. Throw in a beautiful blond who is an expert in ethnopharmacology (I kid you not), who then falls for the Vet, and you could lose your dinner.The bad guy is a cigar smoking ex-vietnam vet (from New York) with an accent you could cut with a knife, central american bad guys (who sound like Eli Wallach in a spaghetti western)...get the idea."
3,The DaVinci code it is not!,"First and foremost, please don't believe the reviewer who claimed that this was another ""DaVinci Code!"" There are absolutely no riddles in this book! I hate to give away any big plot devices, but the great quest to find their father's hidden tomb was solved by just picking up a phone and finding out where he last flew to!That said, this is a mildly entertaining adventure romp through the jungle. It would be fun beach reading (especially on a trip to Central America), but hardly qualifies as one for your permanent colletion."
2,Did anyone edit this book?,"They come upon a young Indian fishing with a bow and arrow. The boat gets closer and he drops his ""rod"" and runs. They shouldn't go ""father"" than the falls up ahead. And so on.I'm not sure how good the book was... the shear lack of editing was very distracting.As to the ""elusive"" codex [see later reviews]... I later discovered that this section was re-written in the paperback edition of the book. So if you read the hard cover edition and get the chance, read the third paragraph of chapter 82 to find out. No one did a final proof read of this book before it was published originally."
4,Reads like a movie script but it's still fun!,I'll have to agree with many of the reviewers that the writing isn't spectacular but the story line is still fun! This is an easy to read book and makes for the perfect type of read for a plane ride or vacation! I hope they make this into a movie -- it was great fun!
3,Good fun.,"If you want good, fast paced fun, straight and simple, maybe this deserves a couple more stars. It really is good fun. These days we demand a lot from fiction with science references and in this the science references fall a little short....again though, it IS fun. Only complaint about the action, and I intend this for all novelists, tv shows and movies...if someone is going to shoot someone, they shoot them...they don't talk about it until the victim gets away. This is such a dinosaur of an escape that it should be, well, taken out and shot."
5,This novel has it all!,"Starting off, this is the best fictional novel I have in some time. Douglas Preston has put together an excellent cast of characters. He also gives us the usual chills and spills like his other books with Lincoln Child. If you like tales of jungle adventure, hidden treasure, and a quest that is never assured of working, you will love this book!"
3,Not bad...,"Once you get past the premise that 3 brothers would go into the Honduran jungle having NO experience in jungle travel, NO idea where they were really going, and NO idea what exactly they were looking for, the book reads quickly and is pretty decent."
4,Thrilling Indiana Jones Type Adventure,"Okay, the premise of The Codex may seem a little silly-- extremely wealthy Maxwell Broadbent takes his sizable collection of art and antiquities deep into a swamp in South America and has himself and his treasures sealed in an ancient pyramid, leaving a message behind for his sons Tom, Virgil and Phillip that if they want their inheritance, they must work together and claim it.Even sillier is the name of one of the main characters, ""Sally Colorado,"" -- that surely has to be a nod to Indiana Jones, however, the book doesn't make any pretense at being anything other than a thriller-- it's almost a literary version of the Indiana Jones movies. I read the book and then a couple of years later listened to the audio version and enjoyed it both times. I found it to be a very strong suspense novel, with lots of action. Yeah, sure, the plot was wildly improbable, but it was still a fun read."
2,A Let Down,"This book was quite a disappointment. After reading other books by Preston and Preston & Child, I expected a much better story. The Codex reads like it was the first book he ever wrote."
3,A useful addition to the TR6 technical collection,"This book is not the comprehensive guide that some people may be looking for but it does provide one more set of data points. I found the discussion of ignition options and the Miata seat conversion to be worth the price of the book while I was dismayed that the only Weber carbs reviewed were the triple 40/45 DCOE's that require extensive engine mods, with no mention of the dual DGV option that would work better on a road car. Many of the parts for suggested upgrades are from small UK suppliers that US readers may find difficult to access. If nothing else it is an interesting read and will provide food for thought while the New England permafrost sets in."
3,"GOOD STARTER, BUT.................",".......incomplete. Once I got a hold of this album, I'm like thinking to myself, well this is pretty good but one exception, you urge for more Bowie because it doesn't have every song I like of his, and to be quite honest, I like his earlier sets better, like Space Oddity, or even Ziggy Stardust, or maybe even Diamond Dogs. Well the list can go on and on but I would be ramblin now wouldn't I. Yeh I guess it's fair to say if you're a casual listener this would be good enough, but if you like his work, go out and just get his studio albums, they're more worth it, unless you like to here just bits and pieces like Let's Dance or Fashion, or even Chinagirl, what about The Man Who Sold The World, or even Rock and Roll Suicide. Well, either way be warned."
5,Without Flaws,"This is a greatest-hits collection that had originally been released in the 70's, and continued to be updated up unto about 1990. All of his pop hits from 1967-1983 are all here, as well as a mix of ""Fame"" that holds up respectably. Not really much to be said here....a little bit of trivia: Stevie Ray Vaughan played the guitar solo on ""Let's Dance"". For the post (geez, over 3 years ago) assuming that Mr. Bowie is racist.....his WIFE is an African-American, so.....need I say more?"
1,Author forgot a few things!,"I was thumbing through this book and noticed that the author forgot to add two very prominent social service jobs. Mental Health Counseling is a huge field and also one of the oldest social service jobs around: Social Workers (which is what I happen to be)! Back in the day anyone from different disciplines could call themselves counselors or social workers, but now days many employers expect you to have AT LEAST your Masters degree in Mental Health Counseling or Social Work to even consider hiring you. That has become the standard in the field. Now having a Bachelors degree is like the equivalent of a H.S. diploma a few decades ago. Author clearly overlooked a few things."
4,Good enough for casual needs,"Fast focus, sharp and accurate at very cheap price. I would rather give 4.5 stars for this lens. I am not a professional photographer. I shoot kids running in room, outyards, parks, and occasionally family gatherings. I upgraded to this lens from the kit 18-55 lens and have not removed it since the day I got this. The zoom is enough for my need. No VR option on this lens, which hurts sometime, but still, I am happy with it, because my friends who carry similar nikkor lens (almost 3 times expensive) mostly produce poor picture than me using this cheap replacement."
3,"Great pictures, lots of noise, slow to focus...","This lens takes great pictures....BUT... I am just beginning in the world of professional photography. I decided that I could afford this lens over the Canon version when Tamron had a sale. However, I wish I had spend the money to buy the Canon lens for 2 reasons. First, this lens is very noisy compared to the Canon version. (I have used my Grandmother's Canon.) Second, it takes awhile to focus. (The Canon lens is faster.)Overall, this is a good lens if you are not in a hurry to catch just the right shot and if you don't have to be quiet. This lens will not work for the upcoming wedding I'm shooting, but the average person, not using it for professional purposes would probably be happy with it."
3,Compromise - Know the trade offs.,"On paper this lens seems to be exactly what anyone would want for their Digital SLR. We used this lens with our Canon Digital Rebel XT. Overall, it was great to have the 28-320 (35mm equiv.) zoom. The size and weight of the lens are nice. But the 2 big issues that ultimately made us send it back were 1) focusing problems and 2) backward zoom rotation (from the Canon lenses) and replaced it with a Canon EF-S 17-85mm IS lens.Most of the time the focusing was just fine but on certain shots it would really search for a focus. I never did figure out if it was certain conditions or what. The fact that the lens rotation to zoom was backward of the standard Canon zoom lenses drove us crazy because every time you wanted to zoom in / out a little bit, you ended up going the wrong way. This was especially a problem in Sports Mode with the subject moving towards you.If these 2 problems don't bother you, you will probably like the lens."
1,fuzzy photos,I am really unhappy with this lens... unless I am in bright sum it seems all my photo's are extremely fuzzy. PS Amazon replaced this lens and the replacement works great... Still hard to focus in low light .
2,"Good for basics, not for professionals","This lens is appealing for its wide to zoom abilities. BUT it has a very VERY small focus. The focus seems to move around constantly, especially if there is any kinds of movement. It seems good for still life but for people it does not work well. I tried shooting a wedding and a portrait with it and found many of the images were out of focus and while I was working with it the focus kept moving all over the place."
1,Don't Do It!!,"I'm soooo sorry I opted for this lens instead of the Nikon Brand. I should have just kept saving for the real deal. This is one of the WORST lenes I've ever owned and I have been a photographer for over 30 years. I got it in August and didn't take many shots until I went on vacation at the end of September. Now I have 167 files that over a third of the image is blurry. Since I waited past my 30 days, Amazon wouldn't help me. I sent the lens back to Tamron for warranty repair. I got it back and it is better, but still not really sharp. How disappointing! I've always hoped for a lens that would cover all the bases, but I guess having it be sharp is TOO MUCH to ask!!! My recommendation, is RUN the other way from this lens.I've used Tamron a LOT over the years and never had a problem....this is a true lemon."
1,Slow focus,"I am a professional wedding photographer and I tried this lens on my canon 7D at my daughter's Halloween party at school. I'm glad I didn't bring it to a wedding off the bat. The room (as most school rooms are) is well lit from windows and the florescents were on - the lens couldn't pick up on the dark costumes to grab fast enough. It hunted a lot and I lost some shots. At the widest, there was A LOT of blur around the edges. Not a crisp shot. I returned it today (after receiving it the day before yesterday). I do have another Tamron zoom that is slow to focus, but this one was much slower in lower light - would not have worked at a wedding ceremony (especially a church) nor a reception."
4,Great Travel Lens,"Great travel lens with plenty of versatility. The quality is far from USM glass obviously but for the money and peace of mind knowing how much it costs, you dont have to worry about losing it or getting it stolen. The quality is acceptable and is pretty good for what it is. I would say the photo quality is slightly better then the Canon 18-55mm IS kit lens."
2,An ok mat,I wasn't expecting the sun and moon to be painted onto the mat... I thought it would have been dyed yarn or something.
3,"Handy, but could be better.","I teach an Interior Design Graphics class and find this book to be useful for a number of tracing images such as trees and cars. The people section is not as up to date as I'd like. Lots of the figures look like they walked out of an old Charlie's Angels set. Still, though a basically good book for its purpose. Just don't expect it to be the end all."
5,A Wonderful Book for Both Parents and Kids,"""Come as you are,"" says the invitation to Jennifer Giraffe's taffy-and-tea party. But Dandelion decides to make himself over -- and to his surprise, no one is impressed. A good lesson for children (and their parents) on the nature of true friendship and genuineness, and the folly of appearing to be someone you're not. This is a terrific book. One of my daughter's favorites, not to mention to mine!"
3,Still prefer Bernstein for Rhapsody,"This version came highly recommended. It is probably a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the Bernstein versions of Rhapsody In Blue and other performers for the additional Gershwin pieces."
1,"Not a mystery, barely a book","This is the poorest excuse for a mystery that I have ever wasted time reading. It is full of idiotic New Orleans cliches, completely one-dimensional characters, and innumerable inaccuracies. All of these things could be excused if at least an interesting, believable story were told. However, the book seems little more than an excuse to get the reader to buy book number two in order to answer questions raised by this book. Since this book was pure garbage, I think I'll save my money. I truly cannot imagine how anyone can recommend this book with a straight face and a clear conscience. I must agree with another reviewer, if only it were possible to give it no stars.Miles"
2,It broke very quickly!,"I bought this item because you dont have to connect it to a network for it to work. You just store your pictures in a compact flash card. I did like it, however I must say that it would show some pictures too many times, and others would never be shown. It sounds like a small problem, but it gets very annoying. Eventually the item broke during a trip to Europe, when I tried a store bought DC adapter that didnt have the Amps needed. I know it might have been my fault, but given it being such an expensive item, I felt that it was made kind of cheaply to break just because it was pluged two seconds with the wrong Amps!"
1,Kodak should just go out of business..,"Although the frame and the orginal Storybox concept was excellent, it is just another orphan product by Kodak. I own one and am looking to begin a class action suit against Kodak for misrepresentation of the product. As a long time user of Kodak products, this is the third time that this company has left me with a nearly worthless product, and I will never again purchase anything that has the Kodak label or is manufactured, merchandised, or supported by Kodak. I would strongly recommend against purchasing anything from this company, including film. I have even switched to all Fuji film in hopes that they will sell enough to continue products. I certainly would not count on Kodak!"
1,This product no longer available,Don't waste your time looking at this one. Google for it and Kodak's site says it's no longer supported.
2,Not Picture Perfect,"I wish I bought the Ceiva rather than this frame because I thought it would be easier for my parents to see their grandkids but it turns out that although the screen may be nice, it's harder to use and more complicated for them. When my parents told me that their friends had a Ceiva I thought they would like the Kodak frame better, but it has more buttons and they really don't need the smart card feature, since I'm the one sending all the photos to them. So in the end, I made the wrong decision which cost me more money."
4,Pleasing performances,"These are nice performances of Mozart's quartets no. 16 and 18, well worth the budget Naxos price. The Eder Quartet works well as an ensemble, producing a sound one reviewer has called ""suave"" rather than, say, passionate or harsh. The style works well with the mostly sunny disposition of the works. It's a pleasure to hear this music well performed, as it is on this disk. The recording itself seems a little distant, maybe because it was made in a large space - a church in Budapest - and not a studio, but that's a quibble."
3,A fun modification of Trivial Pursuit,This cd presents an interactive twist on Trivial pursuit. It is fun and definitely livens up parties. Best enjoyed with a CD player that has a remote control on it. The stories are fun.
3,She didn't tell it all,"I read the book expecting some inside information, I did't get it. She didn't tell anything but the odd things and odd people. My ersonal experience over a long period of time and many establishments she wasn't telling what really goes on, at least part of the time with some of t he dancers. Iknkow htere is a lot of fooling around that happens eveywhere than she disclosed."
1,Waste of time and money,"The woman who wrote this is one of those who thinks she's ""seen it all"" but in fact she's seen basically nothing if you can believe anything she wrote here. She looks down her snooty nose at other strippers and does absolutely nothing to bring you into the REAL world of strip clubs. I've been in them and owned two over the years. She makes out like she was the Virgin Mary of the stripper world -- and her stories are tame, boring and frankly, a lot of BS.There is a lot of hot and tawdry stuff that goes on in a strip club. She does nothing to shed any light on any of it."
3,Ingenious time paradoxes,"Although it would have to be called one of Dick's weaker novels, Dr. Futurity, first published in 1960, is still a lot of fun. It concerns a present-day doctor who is plucked into the future by a tribe of Indians with time-travel technology. In their world the healing arts have been lost, since the ideal of dying to make room for an improved breed of humanity has displaced the value of living one's own life. The Indians, however, are inspired by a fanatical and paranoid leader, who is lying mortally wounded, on whom they wish the doctor to operate. In his effort to save the man, the doctor is thrust into a series of ingenious time paradoxes, which can be seen as a warm-up for the far richer novels Martian Time-Slip (1964) and Now Wait for Last Year (1966)."
5,Product was simple and worked immediatly.,"This product is much simpler than any of the other Fung Shui materials I have used. I found the directios to be clear, simple, and very explanatory about it's purpose. Needless to say my businees has been in a constant upswing after only one week of purchising this particular item."
1,Lossing always top and botoom,"Nice idea, but the details?This T-jak is continuously separating top and bottom from the main pole.Is hard to look for it at the end of each job.Janusz Waksmanski"
1,Turning Richard Raffin,"The three volume work is well done and was written by one who knows his subject. He approaches each topic with an organized process and was easy to follow,even for a beginner, which I am. I have just finished the first two volumes with one to go. I like the way he works in his cautions about turning ,with humor and not preaching. I know I'll re read sections a second and third time as the need arises. The work is complete and much more than I expected. Happy I made the purchase."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I wanted a radio alarm clock that would play MP3 CD's. I think Bose is the only one out there at this time. Anyway, the sound clarity of this unit isn't very good over the speakers. Headset it's not to bad. There is a couple things I don't like about it is that the ""Sleep"" function does not work with the CD player.... You can only use the sleep function with the radio, and the amount of light it puts out. It's like having a night light in your room. Also you can't put regular batteries in the cd player and have it docked because the dock will try and recharge the batteries!"
2,no cord,It would have been nice to know I needed to purchase a chord to make this headset work. I haven't used the head set yet.
3,Okay,"It's nice but I have one question, is it out of date, otherwise it's fine. The actual outlook of the filter suprised me, I thought it would be smaller but it's fine the way it is."
4,Percy Faith CD,CD contains some of my favorite songs arranged by Percy Faith. Music would sound better if CD had been remastered; but still very enjoyable to listen to.
5,Amazing Book For A Student Becoming A Chef!!!,This book is a very useful tool. I am going to school to become a chef so it was very helpful with getting all the information. This book is WONDEFUL!I have probably ready over this a few times...and it a big book!It is such a great book; it has so many useful things to know.I know I will look forward to the 9th edition.This is a keeper!!!Thanks!!!!!
5,The right book,"This is a great book, it has all the I formation I needed and more. The recipes came in real handy at the restaurant. If you need any info. about the kitchen, food and Presentation, local and international recipes, this is the book for you."
4,Good reference,I find the book well worth of four stars. It's an exellent reference book. It shows a variaty of techniques and bunch of recipts. It strenghtens your fundamentals in the kitchen.I own a bunch cookbooks. All of them given to me or come to my hand for free. This is the first cookbook i buy and i dont regret a single dime. It's different form all cookbooks i know because it teaches you technique not a recipe.GPP
5,Perfect book for the budding home chef,This book is used in many culinary schools and is such a pleasure to own for my home also. Bought a copy for my son-in-law who is a novice but really interested in cooking and he absolutely loves it.
1,Falls apart during cooking,"I've made falafel many many times using various mixes, and I am never buying this one again!! I followed the directions, but the falafels disintigrated during frying. I tried broiling some but they were so fragile I couldn't flip them without them breaking. Never buying this brand again. I've had great luck with Casbah brand falafel mix. I'll stick with that!"
5,Extremely well built,"Great product and very very well manufactured, it should last for years on my sailboat, the signal has doubled on my Wilson booster switching from the magnetic antenna to this item! Well worth the investment."
4,"If Harney made Paris perfume, I'd buy it.","This tea smells amazing. It tastes pretty good too. It just seems like a very likeable tea, so it makes a good gift, especially for francophiles or French teachers."
3,Not as dead-on as some other releases,"I hope this isn't a sign of a permanent change in the group. This release, while it takes the formula of others like ""Dispepsi"" and applies it to several original themes, just doesn't ""have it"" in the same way as other Negativland releases do. Still above average, but check out ""Dispepsi"" instead, if you haven't already."
5,I Agree With Everyone Else,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? Not much, so I will basically echo what most everyone else has said: This is a clear, concise guide on how to use a valuable tool. The examples are fairly simple and realistic. What I like are the sections surrounding the examples, such as ""Why do I care?"", ""How do I do that?"", ""What just happened?"", and ""What about..."". These sections essentially surround the examples with more information, allowing you to extrapolate on what was just covered."
2,A dated intro,"In its day, this must have been a useful text. It certainly served as a good introduction to what Hibernate is and does. The examples in this book use Ant 1.5 and Hibernate 2.x. If you still use Ant, you're probably using 1.8.x. Hibernate 4.1.1 has been released as of this writing. I enjoyed the challenge of migrating the examples from Ant 1.5 to Maven 3.0, and hunting down replacements for Hibernate idioms, methods, and fields that were deprecated in version 3.x and removed in 4.x. Take the time to do this, and you'll still get plenty of value out of this book. If you're not interested in doing homework, you're better off looking for a more recent publication date. Also, while this book reads nicely front-to-back, it is difficult to use as a reference due to headers that say meaningless things like, 'How do I do that?' over and over instead of meaningful things like, 'How to generate schema""."
3,its ok,"i think it is an ok book,certainly it does give u a start, but it is not for u if u want a comprehensive book.The content is written in a very understandable fashion.but lot of the content he picked didnt make me feel was worth mentioning."
1,fairy tale bride is lacking..,I'm not sure what happened with this story. It seemed like there were several chapters missing and the way a lot of the events are written is laughable. My copy (kindle edition for $0.99) also has weird german characters in random spots instead of a word or a letter and part of the sentence will be missing. This book wasn't even worth the 99cents. it's a struggle to get thru and leaves you more irritated at the pace&writing then wanting to actually read it.
3,3 1/2 STARS,"Okay, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews that the story line was not believable. But, having said that, it was a very entertaining read with interesting characters, good character development and just fun. It kept my interest and I read it in one day."
2,Fine to read on a bored day,"Decent read, but it's cohesiveness falls apart midway through. I couldn't keep track of all the events and the plot is indiscernible."
3,A cute fairy tail.,"This was a cute story. It was not the best book I have ever read, but it was not the worst. It was a nice love story and it had a happy ending. It was a nice story to read on a rainy day."
5,Thank Goodness for CNBC!,"I am a CNBC junkie -- I just can't get enough, particularly when it comes to understanding what's going on in today's crazy markets. This book not only has same straighforward approach you find on CNBC, it also provides you with an invaluable analysis of how markets work and a list of resources where you can get up to the minute information on world markets. Any book that will help me make sense of what the current stock market is doing will help me feel confident in the choices I make as an individual investor and is worth the price. I highly recommend this book. Thanks."
3,"Good material, quite small","The material used for this protective mat is very good. However the mat itself is very small. It is barely wide enough to cover the cargo floor of my HHR, and is too short to attach over the front seats. It does stay in place with the clips on the front. It would be better if I could use it in just the very rear cargo area with the two back seats in the upright position but then my two dogs would not fit in the cargo area. Although the mat is as described it would be more useful if it were larger."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"Well, almost. I know how to knit and can do some basic things, but I was looking for a book to take me a little further on in my skills, but to date I haven't found the book that can do it. I was also looking for some things to decorate my home with, as always, and this book gave me that. The patterns are simple for the most part, easy to accomplish, and simply explained. I'm looking forward to doing several of the throws for my furniture. One of the things I wish authors wouldn't do so often is include baby items all the time. There are just too many books on the market already on knitting for baby, it's not needed in every book that comes out. The title is excellent for the book."
5,Unbelievably good,"An exquisite black tea with a little extra. If you're fond of black tea but think Earl Grey is a bit twee, give this one a try. The flavor and aroma are brisk but refined. It's become my standard."
3,BArefoot contests at home: everydAy recipe...,Very good and looks rather simple and I am anxious to try using my kindle. Recommended to a novice. Try it.
2,Mediocre,"I have all of her previous books and I have to admit that I am getting a little tired of her cookbooks. I have used her first two books numerous times and the recipes are no fail. However, with the more recent ones and especially this last one, I am beginning to fill that her repertoire needs some refreshing. There is nothing new and exciting here and I have encountered and excecuted extremely close version of these recipes from a number of other chefs/cookbook writers. Let us hope for something better in the future."
4,Easy and Delicious,"I was excited to learn that Ina Garten had a new cookbook coming out. I own all of her previous publications and couldn't wait to see what she had next in store. Sure enough, she's done it again. She's created another series of delicious yet simple recipes for all to share. While sometimes there is more fat added than one would like, the recipes are always yummy. To her credit the recipes are always correct in terms of measurement, degree of heat and timining - a feat within itself! Highlights my family has enjoyed are mustard-roasted potatoes, the lamb kebabs and fresh pea soup (that we made with frozen peas and was delicious). These are simple anyone can do it recipes. It reminds us that anyone can cook their family a healthy meal with less effort than it takes to drive to McDonalds."
5,Another Good Contessa,"Gave this to my wife for the Holidays. She immediately found a great recipe for Cream of Wild Mushroom Soup (pg 48). Also look at the Mustard-Roasted Potatoes (pg 153). If you are not familiar with Ina Garten, you should check out her books. My wife uses the first, The Barefoot Contessa, all the time."
1,"Turn down dying kids, people hate you. It's that easy","I actually took a piss on this book and flushed it down my toilet. Anyone who snubs the make a wish foundation TWICE, is cold and heartless and deserves to fail at everything she does in the future. Her last wish should be to borrow a shovel so she can dig a hole and hide in it forever."
1,waste of money,it is amazing that (my wife) people would buy a cook book so tailored for one persons taste. We sent it back.
3,Not quite everyday recipes,"Okay, so I found the title pretty deceptive. An everyday recipe to me is one that is easy to make, easy to get ingredients for and easy to enjoy. I'm not so sure that the recipes in the cookbook qualify for those 3 criteria. Not a bad choice, but it shouldn't be your first choice either."
2,Disappointment,"I love Ina Garten's cooking style and have all her cookbooks so I was very excited to purchase the latest one. I was disappointed in that there were no recipes that were especially new, some were even a rehash of recipes from her previous books. I have made a great deal of her recipes from prior books but have yet to find one in the new book that is worth making. Sorry Ina, your old recipes continue to inspire me."
4,"Good recipes, easy to make, very summer focuses",This is a very good cookbook with a wide variety of easy to make but yummy sounding recipes. It is very summer focused. By which I mean all the recipes seem like something one would serve a t a summer party in the Hamptons...I guess that is Ina's shtick. Overall a good addition to any home cooks shelf.
4,Feet on the Ground,Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa helps all cooks keep their feet on the ground with recipes that appeal to most appetites.
3,Not Impressed,"I love Ina Garten's recipes on her show so I put this book on my wedding registry. The book was pretty and has nice color photos of each recipe. However, most of those recipes could be found on foodnetwork.com. There weren't that many recipes to begin with and the worst thing was there were a number of fillers like the infamous garlic croutons. I should have listened to the low-rating reviews. For beginner cooks I guess this book would be fine. I found that it's much better to get cook books that specialize in one dish, like a soup cook book, a bread book, desserts, etc... instead of food network books that try to tackle BLD + desserts all in one book. And those non-celebrity cook books could be bought really cheap at the used books section of Amazon.I still love Ina but I'll stick to just watching her show and getting the recipes from the website."
3,Beautiful to Look At - Disappointed in Recipes,"This book is beautiful to look at. Ina Garten also writes well. The problem is with the recipes themselves. I found them to be heavy, full of things like butter and cream which I just cannot cook anymore. My objection is not to the taste of the food, but I can't afford the calories!!!"
5,This stuff works!,This stuff removed my corn in a week. It peeled the skin around it too but I just had to really moisturize my toes after I was done using the remover. It never occurred to me to use on my callus because all i wanted was to remove a corn but I will see what it does for the pad of my feet because I wear really high heels.
5,Great size!,"Great size to cook absolutely anything! I use it all the time - because it's wok-shaped the food practically stirs itself, so nothing sticks to the corners. A must have for my kitchen."
1,Don't buy if you are Canadian!!,Cruesset Canada will not honour the warranty up here on US purchased items!! We have to send ours to the US at our expense. Buy it in Canada!!
5,Sturdy belt,This is a nice belt and was the right size for my 2006 Jeep Liberty 3.7L gas engine. The belt I ordered is #4060868. It was easy to install and is silent so far.
4,"Installs, works well, sometimes hard to remove without damage","Installed in a few places where my mechanic lost the original clips under my Lexus's hood. Installs easy, stays in place,but sometimes, especially if you don't have access to the back of the clip, it's difficult to remove. Soyou need to gouge it with a screwdriver to remove it and destroy it in the process. Luckily, they give you plenty. Typicaldisposable Chinese product. The design could be improved if there was a notch so a fingernail could get behind the plungerto disengage. Much better than paying $2-3 a clip from the Lexus dealer."
2,Ok but expected more,"Formula writing and not much that grabs someone from the onset. Too bad because handled well this could have been an interesting albeit untraditional good read. I see it was self published and can appreciate why. Still, not a bad first self publication effort although it rambles all over the universe - difficult to follow."
3,Well-rounded review of the Krakatoa story.,"Can you give half stars? 3 stars sounds about right. Very interesting read that covers everything from geology to biology and even the political and sociological impact of the Krakatoa Volcano's massive 1883 explosion. I learned a lot and enjoyed much of the book, especially the discovery of Alfred Russel Wallace and the Wallace line. This amazing story and discovery is worth the price of the book. I did find the book rather uneven with a really poorly written first chapter, "".a Pointed Mountain"", but give it time and you will find much to reward in later chapters. If the topic interests you, I'm sure you will enjoy this well-rounded review of the Krakatoa story."
4,Interesting & Informative,"This book was very interesting. I enjoy non-fiction as much as fiction & I found this book to be one of my favorites. It was a little long on some of the in-depth stuff, but overall a book I recommend to friends."
1,tedious,Way too many digressions with large amounts of unnecessary minutia. If the book was half the size I would have enjoyed it a lot more. His Professor and the Madman was also too stretched out.
2,Too dry for me,"Maybe I expected too much from this book. The author seems far too proud of his researching skills and never fails to mention useless bits of informtion that he found. He even goes on his own little personal trips down memory lane, which just made him seem a little pompous to me. But the overall amount of information made me feel like I was swimming against the current to get to the interesting things. Like telling me the life story of a man who did nothing but report the eruption.For example, his plate tectonics explanation was far too complex and riddled with unrelated information. I found myself skipping over large portions because they were simply too technical or had nothing to do with plate tectonics.Overall, I found the book uncompelling and the author's need to show off his researching skills snobby."
4,"More Than History: Very Detailed Scientific, Political and Environmental Analysis","This book is more than just the explosion of Krakatoa. It covers plate techtonics, the history of Dutch Colonialism, the development of Indonesian culture, and the biological recovery of a post-explosion island.Truly this is deatialed, so anyone who is interested in only one aspect of te event (say the historial) may find themselves skimming through sections decribing the evolution of the scientific theory of plate techtonics. However the book is so detailed in every section it does cover that that flaw is minor at best.If you like history read the histrory bits, biology, read the biological bits etc. The story even in these niches will be enough to keep your interest, and you may even learn something by skimming the other pieces."
2,"Longwinded, repetitive and messy","I bought this book months ago out of curiosity. I read it after the Asian tsunami happened Dec 26,2004 since it seemed relevant. The book certainly is well researched, although perhaps this may be its problem. The storytelling is never quite exciting enough. It's longwinded, repetitive and quite messy - the author sounded over-excited. The danger with a subject like this is there are tons of facts and information that when handled the wrong way can make a book a chore to read - and this book is. You get bits of this and that but never quite the big picture. This book needs editing."
3,"Interesting, Though Marred By Digressions","Winchester's book on the largest eruption in recorded human history, at Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, suffers from the same flaw as his book on the San Francisco earthquake: lack of self discipline in policing his own digressions. The story line is fascinating -- and Winchester's discussion of the geological causes of the eruption and its remarkable destructive effects is riveting. But he cannot keep himself from straying way off line in his ramblings about cultural history and personal anecdotes.The subject matter is too interesting to pass up. But this guy should get an editor."
2,2 Good out of 15,I can not believe that Franklin White had me running all over town looking for this new edition. How dry this book really was. Some stories ended before they started . I gave it two stars because there were only two stories that were well written and had a good start and finish. I would like him to pick up with Cee-Cee and Khalil story with them raising Kelly's son. Very disappointing.
4,Fast Paced & Very Interesting,I thought this book was very fast past and a very interesting read. The contents of each story I could easily relate to and had some really good points. I've read all of this authors books and he continues to grow as a writer. A fun read.
1,Worst Album Name Ever,"I've already stated my disgust for this Baptist Youth Group Jam Band in a previous review of anothe one of their waste's of recording time. I am merely writing this review to state that ""In Between Now & Then"" is the lamest, most uninspired, unoriginal, trite, and meaningless album names ever. I mean....EVERYTHING IS IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. Why not make an album called 'Red Means Stop, Green Means Go'.P.S. - it's been used before as wellP.P.S. - Brother Ali Rules"
3,"feels nice, but nothing special","I bought this because I wanted to give my eyes a little extra moisture, but I'm 20 so I don't need anything for wrinkles yet. This gel feels nice. It goes on smoothly and cools (especially if you keep it in the fridge!). Sinks in well so that make-up goes on over it without a problem. My eyes don't look/feel any different after using it for awhile. Then again, I don't have many problems in the eye area to begin with. On the plus side, it lasts FOREVER. Great gel for a little extra moisture, but doesn't do much in the brightening/dark circles department."
1,Inauthentic Herbert/authentic Percy Faith,"If you love the Percy Faith orchestral style, you will certainlyenjoy this typical example. The disc is full and the selections are numerous and varied, including characteristic pieces, operettaexcerpts, and even a couple of excerpts from one of Herbert'sgrand operas.BUT - if you're primarily interested in the music of Victor Herbert, then the advice has to be to avoid this seemingly tempting item. The combination of anachronistic arrangements, altered harmonies, and orchestrations foreign to anything Herbert would have imagined or countenanced ends by falsifying the charm and character of Herbert's music. In essence it's more like ""1950's Fantasies Loosely Based on Certain Herbert Themes."""
3,Good subway reading,"I always have a stash of books that I save for reading on the subway. These books should be easily accessible in terms of the writing style, plot, ideas, and physical size. They should also be interesting enough to make me want to finish them even if it takes weeks of 10-minute subway rides. Victoria Thompson's mysteries fit the bill. MURDER ON GRAMERCY PARK is a delightful turn of the century crime novel. I love it for its details of old New York, though I must admit that they do get repetitive at times. This is not the cleverest mystery, but it's fun to read, the pacing is good and it does make you want to read Victoria Thompson's other books if you haven't already."
2,The Music of Upper & Lower Egypt,Side 2 is the best side to listen to on the tape. Each song on side 1 seems almost identical. I am still looking for some great music on ancient egypt. Please email me with some anyone! thanks
1,"If I could rate it *less* than 1 star, I would...","I also bought this cd when I was first looking for music from Egypt. IT IS AWFUL! The BEST cd's I own are : ""Yalla- Hitlist Egypt""; ""Sif Safaa""; and ""CamelSpotting""."
2,"Knife is OK, but the snap on the case is dodgy",The snap on the case is a real bear to close and requires enormous effort to secure. Otherwise the knife seems ok
3,Schrade OLD Timer knife,"The knife is great for a China made knife & delivery was fast. But the sheath in a month has already started to fall apart, I use the knife all day every day so maybe the constant in & out has taken its toll. Overall not to bad"
5,Something for the teenager,"I surprised my daugher with this creature. She has given it a name and a place in her room. What more can a mom ask for? It is so ugly that it is cute. Feels nice to touch and it is the perfect color. And when her friends want to know where she got it. (She tell them she ordered it)So, for my 14 year old I would say 5 stars."
1,"Pirated edition, avoid!","Don't buy product from pirates. These theives don't deserve your business.Get the *real* Max Fleischer classic Popeye cartoons here:Popeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Vol. 1and here:Popeye the Sailor: 1938-1940, Vol. 2and here:Popeye the Sailor: 1941-1943, Vol. 3.Now, if they'd only do similarly for Fleischer's Betty Boops!!!"
4,High Quality and Heavy,"First-class construction and nicely rubberized to protect your bike. It is too big for me to mount on my bike frame, however, unless I remove my water bottle. Best bet is to put it in your backpack. I live in NYC so I need to the security, otherwise I would suggest something lighter."
1,"Bulky lock, terrible mounting system","The lock itself seems fine, but considerably heavier than I anticipated. The biggest problem is the EZ-Lock mounting system, which is atrociously bad. I tried to get it to stay on my bike for upwards of 4 hours with no success. The instructions have grainy, thumbnail sized black and white pictures and terrible, hard to follow writing. They refer to a youtube video guide which appears to have been taken down. If you intend to mount this lock, please get a different one."
5,I'd give this a 10...if I could! Great Product,These chairs are the best of the best...so well made & reasonably priced.They recline with ease in many positions & are so comfortable.These chairs are so HUGE... big enough for 2 persons to sit on. They aren't lightweight but thats fine & they do take up alot of space when storing them.I LOVE THESE CHAIRS.
1,Disappointing,"This product is huge. Seat very low and sinks. Packaging was pitiful. Arrived looking like it had been through a war. Plastic bag, (yes bag!) was inadequate for such a large and heavy clumsy item. Return was a hassle!"
2,very flimsy for being advertised as large chair,"I bought two of these chairs. They are over sized as advertised, but so poorly constructed that I will be afraid to have a larger person sit in them. The packaging for shipment was so flimsy that the leg joints were poked out of the box and one of the chairs was broken at the leg joint. The leg joints are made of plastic, which I consider inefficient for a Plus size chair. Chairs are large, but poorly constructed. Certainly overpriced for the type of product."
2,"Look sturdy, but are not","These looked wonderful when we received them. We didn't have opportunity to use them much last summer -- once or twice. They were put in the garden shed for the winter. When we took them out this summer, we realized that two of the four were broken. The chairs are made of both metal and plastic and these ones broke at the plastic parts. It is very disappointing, because they look sturdy and are the most attractive folding chairs I've found."
1,Booorring,"Man, this is one lame CD! Save your money. If these jokes were any older, they would have had to press this on vinyl."
1,This is a wonderful CD... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!,"Horrible... I love the Triumph character and have collected many of the videos available on the web, but this CD/DVD set is less than mediocre. If you are looking to find anything on the order of the Bon Jovi, Star Wars, or Hollywood Squares videos, there is none of that here. AThe CD is a bunch of reasonably lame songs and repeating tired jokes, and the DVD is just video of the same stuff that is on the CD. I bought 4 of these for Christmas presents, and 1 for myself. After watching the 1, I decided to buy other things for Christmas and return the 4 for a refund."
1,Not even close to Triumph's best material! Terrible!,"Look, i've been a fan of Triumph the insult comic dog for years now, especially some of the most classic moments showcased on Conan and other TV shows, such as when he toured the Hollywood stars' homes, or all the Westminster dog show skits, the Bon Jovi interview, etc, but there is nothing on this CD/DVD that even comes close to the classic, truly funny stuff! In fact, I want a refund, this is so utterly mediocre. The record company responsible for this garbage 'filler' material should be ashamed for releasing this second rate stuff! This release is truly, unequivocally FOR ME TO POOP ON!!! The CD would make an excellent 'pooper scooper'."
2,Not worth it...,"The songs are widely available on the 'net. For 10 bucks you could listen to the album on Napster and have access to thousands of comedy album, including all of Adam Sandler and Richard Pryor albums and 500,000 other songs. The whole album is available on their premium service subscribers, so you can listen to it as many times as you want for a month.I mention this because only 5 songs are funny and that would want to listen to more than 3 times. The prank calls are painfully unfunny.This is definitely an album NOT worth owning. But Triumph fans will want to listen to it ONCE they try my suggestion.The best songs are:'you got to work blue''Benji's qu**r''I keed''blackhawk'There are basically 8 songs on the entire album. The rest are filler. The prank calls are a big FU to the people who bought this album."
1,A steaming pile of crap,This album sickens me. It's not funny and it's a big FU to everyone who ever thought Triumph was funny on Conan's show.Conan insists on singing on this album and that is equivalent of terrorism to the listener.You may want to download it on Kazaa if you are a masochist. It's available there for free.
1,Great CD...for me to poop on!,"I've always loved Triumph, always will, but this is just a crappy album unless you find loads of profanity amusing. And I am in no way against profanity. There's just so much of it that the ""jokes"" become repetitive and boring.Skip the CD, watch Conan"
2,Triumph is funnier than this CD,"I wish I could be more positive about Triumph's first CD/DVD, because he's funny enough to have a great one.It's just not this one.His appearances on Conan O'Brien, Comedy Central Roasts and Hollywood Squares are absolutely hilarious and perhaps, because of the restraints of TV censors, he's funnier because he has to hold back on obscenities. The nonstop profanity actually becomes tiresome after several tracks. I wasn't offended, I just got bored by it.There are funny moments, but nothing that would win Triumph any new fans.Instead of confining Triumph to a stage show, they should put together a DVD of Triumph's segments from Late Night (the Bon Jovi concert, the Hollywood bus tour, the Star Wars premiere are all hysterically-funny classics) with some interviews with ""celebrities"" and such.And, of course, Triumph violating Muppets or the Petsmart sock puppet."
5,I hope the dog wins!,"Triumph, you are the king of poop! When Conan announced you were nominated for the Grammy I had to get this cd. How did you get Conan to do that duet? He must have lost his entire cat audience after this came out! It is one of the funniest songs I have ever heard, so it was worth it. Thanks T-Dog. Now I can laugh as hard in my car as I do watching you on TV!"
2,I Thought it was better,"I didn't like this movie unfortunetly. I'm a Linda's fan and she's a great actress. The movie is boring, too slow and the sound quality of the dvd is not good.The characters are shown too superficially."
5,Born Raped!,"I saw Born Innocent on 5/27/03 and for people who says that she was raped with a broom stick was actually raped with a toilet scrubber in the shower-room. It was a good movie overall and it was very dramatic for a girl name Christine Parker who has an abusive father is the reason why she runs away constantly from home.Overall, I give this movie a 5!"
2,Old time Cheesy,"I bought this because i remember growing up watching this, you can tell its for sure late 70's, early 80's. It is cheesy but back then it didnt seem so on tv hahha. I probably will never watch again, but it was nice to relive my youth for that 90 min. I've always loved Linda Blair also."
4,In the Absence of the Sacred,"Provides a good overview of the history between native people's and the US government's policies toward natives. Shows the impact that American economic policy is having upon indigenous peoples here and abroad,as well as, the impacts upon the environment and cultures, worldwide. I would recommend this book, especially to those, who like to hide their heads in the sand and pretend the US and it's economic theories are so innoculose."
5,A must read,"This is an all time favorite of mine and an absolute must read for everyone living in the ""modern"" world of today."
5,Prime Products Elite Folding Rocker,It is great! I got it to rock my grandchild. I can quickly take it to any room in the house. I even took it to the 4th of July fireworks. I like to put a seat cushion in it to make the rocker a little more comfortable.
3,Decent Rocker Sturdy Build,This is a very decent sturdy built rocker. It's heavier gauge tube construction should last a long time. Canvas seat and back. Someone mentioned that this fits a large person - it does not. It fits the average size person. I would recommend it. I might buy another one.
4,Great book that really makes you think about finance !,"The author's humor is not always funny and is mostly used to fill up the pages, but the contents are interesting and enlightening. It gave me courage to continue what I was already doing in the stock market, buying ""losers"". A must read for everybody interested in investing or finance !!"
4,smells good but not washable,"It doesn't say it is washable, but I typically think that toys and crafts for kids should be easy to wash off of skin and clothes, not with this product. I would recommend only buying this for older children."
3,"Nice zoom range, not so great quality","This lens is great for what it is made for, being versatile in its zoom range.That is about it for this lens. The quality of the images in a 4x6 are also fine, you can't tell the difference between that and the nikons I have, but only when you look at 4x6 prints. However, when you start to blow up the images you can really tell the difference of quality. The images are not sharp at all, and not because of a lack of focus.If you are interested in this lens for professional photography, I would not recomend it, there is no way I would shoot a wedding or any other event with this lens. But if you want a cheap lens that has a pretty decent zoom range, this is not a bad choice...assuming you don't plan on enlarging your images past 4x6."
2,Not dated,"Thefilm arrived in the box but the area which identifies the batch and the expiration date for the film had been cut from each of hte 5 boxes. CLearly, I annot tell if I have out dated film or not until I use it.Poor action on the seller's part."
5,Quality Sheets at Full Retail Price,"Sferra ""Celeste"" sheets are 406 Thread Count, Egyptian Cotton, Percale, made in Italy.A quality sheet,for sure. If you're willing to pay, Sferra offers higher thread counts too.Don't be misled, the price here is the full retail price you can find anywhere, no deal on amazon. In fact, if you shop around a bit, you can find better prices on Sferra."
4,"Quiet, but not right for my Jeep","I purchased this as a replacement for my Jeep Liberty. Although quiet at first, I soon noticed a burning smell coming from the serpentine area. It turns out that the OEM Liberty belts have a grooved, or grippy pattern on the backside of the belt. This proves to be important since the back side drives the water pump, and it will slip on that pulley if it's not the right belt."
1,Don't buy these!!! They are defective.,"Did not want to give 1 star. By prior reviews, these should not be sold. These people aremun ethical'to continue to sell these coasters."
5,Perfect Bible for Teens and PreTeens,Our school purchased these bibles as graduation gifts for our sixth graders. They were very much appreciated and the kids loved them! The side-bar commentaries and real life applications and history information is especially nice.
1,A bad translation of the Bible,"I am very dissapointed at this version of the Bible for young Catholics. The translation used is very poor so that it sometimes distorts the original meaning of the passage. It is just a collection of selected passages anyway with some features thrown in to make it special, so you end up re-reading the same passages in a regular bible with a more faithful translation. In other words, just give your young catholic a regular bible and let him skip through it and you will have the same result."
2,Dry and Too Technical,"This book seems at first to appeal to a more general audience, but then drowns the first chapter in technical and dry prose. Although the author clearly knows his material, the delivery was so dry that it was difficult to get through. The title proves different than the content, because it really deals less with helping readers to take risks, but seems more about the field of risk management. I think the author intended this book for professionals in the field, but for generalists who want to understand risk, I would recommend other books. For instance, ""Predictably Irrational"" by Dan Ariely and ""Feel the Fear...And Do It Anyway"" are much better books for personal and professional development when it comes to risk and fear."
4,Ridiculous but fun serial!,This is a ridiculous serial (What do you expect? James W. Horne is the director!) but it's a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed the short fused master villain Ivan Shark and his inept henchmen. Dave O'Brien is fine as the Captain and the supporting cast is fine. The print quality is not quite as good as it is on some of the other VCI DVD serials but it's more than adequate. 15 chapters on 2 discs with some bonus serial trailers. Highly recommended for serial fans!
3,More hilarious serial fun from James W. Horne,Serial purists will roll over in their graves or fall off theirsofas after viewing this one. James Craven is back again rantingand raving against his underlings and wearing many ridiculous disguises. One hilarious scene has him arguing with his daughterover the sillyass disguises he dons--of which she strongly disapproves. In another scene his numbskull thugs knock each other out. Keep your tongue firmly in your cheek and you will have a lot of fun watching this one.
3,Limited band with two anthem tracks,Ok so they sound forced most of the time but and this is a big but for those that were on the club scene in the UK when this came out Groovy Train and All Together Now were huge and generally would get the masses moving. Download those two tracks and thats all you need to know.
3,Outdated Indie,"When people will think back to bands from Liverpool, they are more likely to think of The Beatles than the likes of The Farm and The La's. Not surprising as The Farm can't even manage to find 14 tracks to fill this Best Of, relying on four remixes to end the CD. Groovy Train is still a funky track and All Together Now is destined to appear eternally on indie compilations in the emotional section but otherwise the tracks here are pretty unmemorable a few years after they were released. Stick to The Smiths if you want British guitar music as they did it so much better and with much more consistency."
4,Great New CD!!!,"Smile Empty Soul's self-titled CD is most likely going to be one of the best CD's of the year. ""Bottom of the Bottle"" is the song that gained this CD it's popularity. However, in my opinion, just about every other song on the CD is just as good if not better than that song. ""Silhouettes"" is my personal favorite. The only criticism I have towards this CD is that the lyrics are somewhat poorly written. However, this is thier first CD and I'm sure that this will be taken care come thier next CD. If these guys keep up, look for them to be headlining major events before too long!!"
5,awesome,"I heard SES's song Bottom of the Bottle and thought they were pretty good but then i bought the CD, THEY ARE AWESOME!!! If you like this sorta music I say buy the cd cause its really really good."
4,one of the best new bands,"I live in seattle, and the i listen to 107.7 THE END. I first heard Smile Empty Soul while listening to the radio, and they mentioned this new band, and i loved what i heard. I have been waiting for the cd to come out, and in the meantime, i've listened to several of the song samples, and i had to buy it. The only reason i rated this cd 4 out of 5 is because i just got it and i haven't had the time to listen to all of the songs, but from what i've heard, it's well worth the 10 bucks i spent on it. I really hope these guys make it, because they have a lot of talent! Keep up the good work!"
5,Bottom of a Bottle,"Smile Empty Soul is a good band. It is one of those groupes that you listen to once, and you get hooked. Bottom of a Bottle is a real catchy song. Their new single, Nowhere Kids is a good one too. The Other Side is another great song. I think 10 of 14 songs are good on this one, but that's just me. Get this one. It is good."
5,Remarkable and Enlightening to the Realisms of the World Today,"My friend had let me borrow Smile Empty Soul about a year ago. She had told me that it was slightly depressing, which indeed it can be. I had never heard of Smile Empty Soul prior to this and was astonished by what I had heard. Smile Empty Soul hails with realism and enlightenment of the darker side of life. ""This is War"" is a brilliant song in a time where America is at war and it almost feels as if we are hearing a soldier's thoughts on war. It is incredibly touching. Smile Empty Soul has lyrics to be thought about over and over again, gaining new meaning and understanding with each play of the CD. This is one CD that, if you're anything like me in wanting to analyze and find true meaning in music, you can't go wrong with. It's a diamond in the rough with its almost ominous melodies accompanied by the deep, meaningful lyrics. This is a must-have CD that everyone should include in their CD collection."
4,Awsom Awsom,"I just wanted to drop in and submit my review as well. I was at the music store the other day and saw them and could'nt remember who they were but knew that I had heard of their name before. I then remembered that they were on tour with Trapt and Seether (both of which are bands that I truly love!). I listened to the cd on cdnow.com and really enjoy the song ""bottom of the bottle"" so i bought the album. Like the other review, I too give them a ""4"" for a rating because I have yet to listen to the entire album because of how much I enjoy the first 5 songs. I continually play them over and over again. I to agree that this has ultimate potential to be a very gewd album and i recommend it to anyone who is looking for what I feel to be a ""combination of seether and trapt together""."
4,A suprisingly good debut album from Smile Empty Soul.,"I didn't expect a whole lot out of this cd when I bought it. The single, 'Bottom of a Bottle' didn't do much for me. I didn't hate it, it just wasent amazing. I didn't think their other songs would sound much better either. That is, until I bought this. This is a great debut, and one of the best cds of 2003. The song lyrics are all very personal. Some of the songs are darn catchy too, such as 'Radio in a Hole'. I personally don't hate a song on this album which means that is really good. This is a great cd and a suprisingly good one too. I would give this the 'Suprise Hit of the Year' award. Go check it out. I wasent dissapointed."
4,Don't Care High is a great book for any child.,"This book envokes a feeling that brings about a sense of envolvement. The characters show us their feelings of mystery, even to themselves. The end left me wondering about Otis and his car. The movement of the story was swift but unnoticeable. The end came about quickly, and when it was over I had to read it again"
4,This is a funny and fun book,"This is a good book. Though this author is more geared to guys, I (a girl) really liked it. I would definitely reccomend this book. This is a school you'll wish you went to"
3,Great at first but...,"I bought this battery in July 2008. It's September 2009 and it's dead. At first it was amazing. My computer was a super star, running about 4-5 hours on a charge. However, 3 months ago or so, it started draining a LOT faster. Now it's down to 20 min. Perhaps it's my computer or the battery. I own a T43, so it's definitely getting old. However, the battery only lasted about a year for me. Any one else experience this?"
3,good but monotonous,"good songs and cheerful arrangements but the songs all sound the same (same voices, same instruments) so it gets monotonous. everything starts sounding the same after a while."
5,Great collection of songs,I love this collection of songs and look forward to listening to them with my kids and singing along.Good quality for the price!
5,Great to hear these songs all together,"My kids have been introduced to many of these songs at their daycare. I remembered some of them vaguely from my own childhood, but it's been so long, I wasn't able to help them carry the tune. It's fun to have this music at home for our family, and it puts a smile on my 2 and 4 year olds' faces."
2,yawn,"sorry , i tried but it was just plain boring and got more and more hokey. i gave up half way. not much to recommend here.also it became obvious that this was written quite a few years ago despite the alleged publication date of 2011. there needs to be some way of clarifying this in the product details."
3,Pretty good,Pretty good- a small town feel - likeable characters- held my attention fairly well. A quick easy read. Good dramatic ending
4,Great Value,"well I got this camera a few days ago and ,I am really impressed with all the features of this little thing. I would say its downright perfect for pretty much everything other than professional print photos or something like that. I mean I bought it cause it was cheap , if I wanted soopa doopa picture quality I would have bought one of those 2000 dollar nikon jobs. you cant beat the price! picture quality is better than you would think too. Like all the other reviews say its great in low light, no flash needed. ok I'll stop rambling."
5,Elmo edible cake art - perfect product!,This was my first time buying an edible cake art. It was a perfect decoration for my son's 2nd birthday cake. He loves Elmo and when he saw the cake (which I made myself) he was very excited and couldn't wait to bite into the cake. The picture itself was very easy to remove and place on the cake. It blended so well with the cake that nobody believed that it was a place-on picture. I am very happy and recommend it highly! Thank you!
4,It is wonderful,"Realy, I like the CD. Because I am form Argentina and here the CD was not edited. I recommend you listen the ""Misty blue"" song. Excellent. And the others. Thanks."
2,Title IS misleading.,"I am writing this review just to reiterate another review a customer wrote that: ""much of the first half of this book focused on the question of whether you should leave the profession of law (which may be helpful for people who have not yet made this decision.) The remainder of the book was EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL to any reader. When it comes to the ""300 things"" you can do with a law degree, Ms. Greenberg simply lists other professions that lawyers have held. Very superficial."" It is exactly how I feel about the book, though I gave it an extra star than the other review. I'd think that the 300 things would be the meat and potatos of the book and it'd be the most helpful part of exploring options, but it's merely a list of a professions that other lawyers have held."
5,"A great, inspiring book","This is a GREAT book! It's aimed basically at the highschool student, but can be applied to anyone. JK talks about the problems with the way most education is setup, the problems with teachers and parents. He says ""Learning is possible only when there is no coercion of any kind...There is coercion through influence, through attachment or threat, through persuazzive encouragement or subtle forms of reward."" I reccommend this book highly! Next time you see it in a used bookstore get a copy of it."
2,Seemed to Lack Substance,"The video was entertaining in that I found myself listening to two expert story tellers, but it lacked a certain kind of substance.I noticed the lack of substance when Ms. Tickle made the comment that people take no ""political risk"" when they share their story to others. And by political she meant that it would cause no social harm or risk of being ostracized. I respect her opinion, but I just know that is not a true statement.I think the reason we dont share our stories more often is that there is such a risk, especially in the Christian crowd, of facing these judgements once people know some of the choices we have made.Reading the previous review on here, I totally agree that there are so many valuable stories waiting to be heard, but it seemed for me that this DVD didnt invite me to share mine with anyone new. Sorry!"
2,Nice bag but no room,"I purchased an InFocus IN26. Nice bag to store and protect the projector, but has no extra room for cables. I returned and purchased another bag. Amazon was excellent in handling this return."
2,not for 3/4 hardwood flooring,There are better options if you plan on using this for 3/4 solid hardwood flooring. I think this would work fine for the laminate or engineered hardwoods but for what I used this for it didn't really work.
3,frustrating,"The effect of this book on me was much like Rubin's attempts to control her weight--frustrating. The irony is that she's very intelligent and self-aware, yet is utterly unable to change her own behavior. I do commend her courageousness in documenting it.There's only one mention of BED in the book (binge eating disorder). I wish she had explored this more. Also, I wish she had realized that therapy was something she needed at least as much as a nutrition program.For me, the book is having the effect of a powerful negative example. I'm hoping to use Rubin as the model of everything I don't want to be. I hope it helps."
5,"Gutsy, honest, true.","A book this raw deserves five stars, just for plain guts. But when you add in Rubin's way with words, her self-deprecation, and her humor, it makes me wish I could give her a few more.Anyone who's ever struggled with their weight, self-image, or food will relate to Rubin's tale of dieting, falling off the wagon, bingeing, and trying again. She speaks for everyone who's eaten too much and hated herself for not being able to zip up that ""skinny"" pair of jeans. Full of raw emotion, gut-wrenching honesty, and a good dose of humor, Rubin has written a story that the majority of women -- whether they have to lose 5 lbs. or 50 -- can relate to.I remember Rubin's columns in SHAPE and am so glad that she shared the stories behind the stories with everyone. I do wish she was a little more descriptive in the epilogue, though -- has she made it to a ""healthy"" weight? Is she happy? Has her obsession with food and weight decreased? I can only hope she'll write a sequel."
2,Should have read the reviews,"I could barely finish this book. It started out great, but after a while it really got on my nerves. Having spent the last year loosing 70 pounds, I feel Courtney just does not GET IT. You can't diet, you have to change your lifestyle and she never does this. The last half of the book, detailing her binges was extremely painful, especially since she never recovers from it.If you are loosing weight, this book will do nothing to encourage you, only depress you. Just awful"
2,Not for more than one bike,"Have used this model for about six months now, the retaining straps on the top bars slide to the end during longer trips. If you put two bikes on the rack the top bar can bite into the trunk top if you have a sedan and leave a dent. Not meant for heavier bikes or long trips. I have upgraded to the stronger Saris Bones 2 model. Now I can carry two bikes and have no more problems with bikes shifting or loose straps."
4,Perfect for my HHR!,"Very pleased with this bike rack. Fits on my HHR, was easy to install (this was my first bike rack, and first time ever trying to use one myself and it only took 10 minutes), stayed tight with no shifting. Also fits my boyfriends Forester which is great. Overall product does what it is says."
3,Good for the price,I got this because it was pretty cheap and it fits on a ford focus hatchback. It works fine with one full sized mountain bike but I think the 2 bike capacity must be for road/kids bikes. It works fine for short distances but I would not be very comfortable using this on a road trip without having to frequently stop and make adjustments. I also recommend bungee cords in addition to the straps to hold your bike in place.
4,One problem,"This bike rack is really easy to use and I like it. The one problem I faced was on a 200 mile drive; the plastic rings that attach the tie-down strap to the metal frame kept sliding forward allowing the bike to slide forward as well. No matter how much additional straping I used in trying to secure the bike and stop it from leaning and sliding while driving, nothing worked. Upon arriving to my destination I went to a hardware store and found a plumbing, pipe clamp that I attached around the frame preventing the tie-down strap from slipping forward. I purchased and attached two of these clamps directly infront of the tie-down straps, and the last 200+ miles of my trip went perfectly. I also recommend getting some pipe insulator tubes to protect your bike where the tie-downs go around the bike frame."
2,Wow what happened,This seller appears to be selling a complete box of cards. I got one small single package with about nine cards in it. The same one that would run about 3 bucks at any store. Oh well my fault too. The add does say it is nine cards ... The picture add appears to be a complete box with several card packs..... Read all the details. I do think the seller is being sneaky and many people thought they were buying
1,Previously used and missing parts,I never got a chance to use it. The tool arrived missing parts and appears to of been previously used as a significant amount of the orange paint had been scraped off. Returned to Amazon for refund.
5,A new Christmas treasure,HILARIOUS!! Touchingly acted and undeniably British. I love Christmas movies and this is a new staple for every year. Yule love it too!!
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!,"This movie is so much fun! I saw it in the theatres in Dublin in 2009 and have been eagerly waiting for it to come out on DVD in the states. If you liked Love Actually, this is the holiday movie for you. It's fun and silly and festive - you won't be disappointed!"
3,A Very Enjoyable Christmas Movie,"This is a very good movie which starts off a bit questionably (primarily with the obvious comic relief character, the teacher's aid) but really develops into an enjoyable movie. I've given this movie a solid three star rating because it is not a perfect five star movie. The elaborate show at the end is fantastic but unrealistic given a school's resources and the characters don't have great development except for the lead. But these are minor nitpicks in what was an extremely enjoyable movie. Definitely recommended. I do wish there was more than a Spanish subtitle (there's a cute blonde boy (who looks like a young Simon Pegg)) who just cracks me up but with the English accent, is hard to follow. There's also no extras beyond a trailer for the movie. But if you think a delightful English Christmas movie is right up your alley, then definitely check out this movie. I bought my DVD sight unseen and I'm very happy for doing so."
5,RotoZip Carbide bit RZ250 1/4 inch.,This little piece of metal performs magical cuts in most of the hard surfaces I have used it on. And it lasts & lasts. A time-saver for me at work.
1,aspenbill,"Worked great for 3 recessed lights, (lots of Dust) after that it would not work at all. It had burned up way to quick for the price of this bit."
1,Blatant exploitation of the Yanamamo for religious propaganda,The book is a cheat. It appears to be a true story until the middle of the book where the Christian claptrap becomes obvious. The author simply uses the Yanomamo as a shill to promote his own religious beliefs with a story that is clearly fictional.
5,hypnotic,"I've never been a Tori Amos fan before, but this album won me over. It takes a few listenings to appreciate all the tracks, and there may be a few superfluous ones, but one the whole it's sheer beauty without the affectations that sometimes could be a bit off-putting about her earlier music. The standout-track is Sorta Fairytale. I can't stop listening to it!"
3,Volatile,"I really wanted to like this CD, but I just couldn't get into it. I admire what she was sharing, her feelings about humanity's treatment of itself... It just did not convey into musical scores I wanted to listen to."
5,Tori Returns,The new record returns us to a pre-strange little girl state and is much more sonically pleasing. This recording clearly represents her return from edge. I recomend it highly to both new and old fans.
1,Not the best ever.....,"I bought Scarlet's Walk expecting Little Earthquakes again. Like another reviewer, i feel that this album is boring!I wonder what happened to the passionate piano and lyrics of Little Earthquakes, Under the Pink, and Boys for Pele. I have been listening to Tori since the early 90's and I think that her fans have been disillusioned into thinking that everything she puts out is a masterpiece. These songs blend together like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that has been sitting out for a week. Although the extras with the album were fun, I would have rather bought an album worth playing all the time. I'll stick with the old stuff....."
5,Tori's Back,"After ""To Venus And Back"" came out I was a little worried. ""Choirgirl"" was pretty good, but I was depressed with some of the more techno, drum machine beats.""Scarlet's Walk"" gets back to the real deal. This disc is very well written and produced. There is a lot of emotion in the songs, and the use of real drums is a major plus. Her vocals are sensual and the lyrics flow.The packaging for the limited edition DVD is insane. I don't understand why more bands/artists don't put this kind of effort into a project. Tori went all out with this one. The only thing that bothered me is the old guy in the video(s). In particular, the part where he unzips her dress.......????????? Disturbing.I honestly cannot believe that the overall rating isn't a full 5 stars."
3,Scarlet's BORING walk,"it grows on you. the more you listen, the more you'll find. tori is the best live performer out there. her latest tour was stunning."
5,Tori in her old style,"To be honest... Tori's last cd's didn't catch me that much as her first cd's did.I missed the typical songs. Songs like ""Baker baker"" or ""Winter"". The songs without a noisy band, songs that stand on itself. Just Tori and her piano.Now on this new album, Tori goes back to her old style.All the songs are catchy and the story behind it is great (look at the map and the enclosed polaroids! What a fantastic idea!)I really like the calm songs and Gold Dust is a real good last song of the cd.The first Tori-fans will love this...definately!"
5,Tori amazes again,"""Scarlets Walk"" is one of Toris Masterpieces!The Album contains sensitive songs with beautyful melodies and good lyrics.In this album Tori isn't too hard to understand (in contrast to her recent album)the melodies are clear and Toris voice is beautyful and at the same time very interesting.The listener can quickly get attached to the songs.Like every Album i reccomend though to let the Album play a couple of times first so the melodies can find a nice place in your ear.I bought the ""Limited Edition"" which i regret!I'd rather buy the normal CD.The ""Limited Edition"" contains an extra DVD which has dissapointed me very much, and a little ""Charm"" and a Map.The Cds are put in a ""box"" and they have no real plastic case!So in my opinion the ""extras"" aren't worth the price and it is better to get a plastic case to take care of this great CD.Buy ""Scarlets Walk"" it is a masterpiece.You won't regret buying it!"
3,A real Review from a True Fan,"I tire of reading these reviews where these insane Tori-philes (eager fans) otherwise known as ""ears with feet"" go on and on about how great Tori is. She could package up an album of pure...CRAP but still there would be praise as soon as these fans hear it.I am a fan of tori's first four albums. Venus sent her out of orbit and strange little girls put most of us to sleep.SCARLETS WALK seems to be free of the techno sound of Venus, but still manages to put me to sleep ala strange little girls.There are no big movers and shakers on this album. Dont expect to find Precious THings, or Marianne, or even Cornflake girl.Maybe that old saying is true, that pain brings out the strongest creative force from an artist.Maybe now that Tori is happily married and with a child, she no longer has that creative fire.Im happy she is out with new material, but i refuse to praise it blindly.on that note, the three best tracks are FAIRYTALE, TAXI RIDE and GOLD DUST."
2,Poor Music Considering It's Tori,"This CD reminds me of Tori's ""To Venus and Back"" mixed with ""Under The Pink"". She rips herself off and does it poorly. This does not mean all of the songs are bad, but the majority are boring and too mainstream for a Tori fan that considers 1991-1996 to be her best years. This is disappointing, considering I have been lisening to her since 1991/1992. I think this may be the last Tori album I will buy. My favorite musician has lost me as a fan."
5,One Great Ride,"Having been a fan for many years I thought she couldn't top herself, but she has. It is a long album and very involved. I really love Taxi Ride, Wednesday, Your Cloud, and Gold Dust. She amazes me more & more with every release. I am glad she took the time to write during Strange Little Girls, it shows. I really love the limited edition package, she really knows how to cater to true fans & collectors. It comes with a huge map of the albums concept and lyrics, stickers, lots of photos, a DVD and a special gift (I got a wonderful silver star pendant, a friend got a little toy, while a fan I met at her show got a plastic snake.) I wish I knew how many different special gifts were included in each package. Anyhow, this album gets better with every listen. Go get it!"
4,Music for autumn in Helsinki,"I'm obsessed now, I bought this record last week and I've listened to it a couple of times every day. I immediately fell in love with it - and the feeling just seems to grow. : )I like melodic and melancolic, but hopeful songs and in my opinion this is one of Tori's best albums. I 've purchased all of her albums except Strange Little Girls and From Venus and Back. Scarlet's Walk is ""easy listening"", compared to the intensive and dramatic From the Choirgirl's Hotel, but that doesn't make it boring. Tori's outstanding ability to create an intense atmosphere is the key to her success in my opinion (and in my ears). Actually, I can't say anything negative about Scarlet's Walk right now.Of course, listening to this record make me think of the terrible scenario in New York September 11 last year, my thoughts are with all of you concerned by the tragedy."
3,"Not bad, but I miss the old Tori","It's more of a return to her older style than her last couple of albums, but this is definitely ""the new Tori."" There's some solid tracks on this disc, but it lacks the raw emotion and feeling of Tori's older recordings. If you're just discovering Tori Amos, you'd be much MUCH better served by looking into her first three recordings--Little Earthquakes, Under The Pink, and Boys For Pele."
5,"Easy to read, hard to put down","This is a short novel that is very easy to read. Ienjoyed it very much and I would recomend that anyone looking for a good book, read this one. It is about the Navajo people and their customs. I am very glad that our professor required us to read it. The symbolism and the imagery are simple and clear. I can not stress how much I enjoyed this book"
3,"Excellent story, poor execution","999 Officer Down transports the reader behind the scenes into the life of Phoenix cop Russ Reiker. Written by his wife, Catherine Marfino-Reiker, the narrative is heartfelt and poignant, describing great triumphs and losses in this man's life.Unfortunately, Mrs. Reiker is not skilled in the craft of writing. She gets her story across, but without the help of a good editor. I frequently stumbled over mid-sentence tense or point-of-view changes. I was also left feeling unsatisfied at the end because she provided few details about the cause of Russ's accident.For the story, this is great book. If you also read to enjoy creative language and vividly painted images, you're likely to be sorely disappointed."
4,"Great 3/4"" Hardwood Flooring Nailer.....That's it","Works great as a true 3/4"" hardwood flooring nailer. I do not recommend it even with the attachment for laminates or engineered products. It damages the flooring."
4,The mallet,"I have put down thousands of feet of flooring, manually and pneumatically.I have enjoyed my new Bostitch stapler, but, the urethane faced mallet provided with the stapler self destructs after about 500 feet of use. the face crumbles and leaves pieces between the flooring that makes for poor fitting. I have gone back to my rubber faced mallet and I hope that Bostitch does too."
5,Flawless victory!,"This tool will simplify your job a lot. I used it for black bamboo flooring (what? ... I know) it worked flawlessly (see picture). For bamboo flooring you have to lower your PSI, in my case it was 85 PSI; start low, say 75 PSI and keep increasing the PSI until the staple is flushed with the tongue of the hardwood (use scrap for this testing).It comes with a nifty ""pre-finished-flooring adapter foot"" which protects your pre-finished floor while installing it. You can also align and tighten the floor planks by tapping on this adapter foot directly, no need for a piece of 2x6. If you do not want to use this, or do not have it, or want to get close to the wall, then tape (blue painter's tape) all sharp points of the tool including the bottom shoe and voila no scratching of your new installed floor.Also, make sure you lubricate it. Lastly, make sure you use the right spacer shoe for your floor thickness, in my case it was the 5/8 spacer."
4,"Interesting documentary if you're not looking for something ""paranormal"".","Unlike the first reviewer, I wasn't expecting this to be a set of ghost stories, just an exploration of some old and forgotten places in Florida, so I wasn't disappointed. It IS just that. Nothing goes ""boo"" and nobody's walking around with tri-field meters and recording EVP activity. There are NO ghost stories aside from a rumor of a supernatural ""curse"" ascribed to one location. If you're looking to be scared, it's not going to happen here. But if you're a fan of ghost towns this is a new and slightly different twist on the ""Old West"" variety, in that it's set in the far southeast instead.Not having ever been to Florida, I enjoyed this micro-snapshot of its history and the exotic scenery it's set against as a backdrop."
4,Dealer Button,"Fast service and a good overall price. No complaints. The item arrived as was as advertised. Not much more I can say about a small white disc with ""DEALER"" marked on it?! Hope you win big with it."
1,NOT JUST ANOTHER GOOD MOVIE,"This movie did so well as ""The Chaos Experiment"" they renamed it ""The Steam Experiment"" and re-released it. After the original came out, the state of California reacted to the film and made it illegal for Eric Roberts and Val Kilmer to be in a movie together for the greater good of humanity.Val Kilmer shows up at a Grand Rapids newspaper and wants his manifesto published on how global warming is going to destroy the world in 2012. He claims he has 6 people held hostage in a steam bath and they are going to die. The police are called in and the movie swaps back and forth between the steam room and the police interrogation, neither of which has enough drama, acting, or clever script to hold my attention. Once Eve Mauro put her top back on, the movie was over for me. Oh yeah, there is a twist at the end which only makes the movie worse, if that is possible.Doesn't work as a horror, drama, action, or thriller.F-bomb, nudity, a mouthy Italian, and a cop with a pinkie ring."
3,Fun and Educational but gets frusturiating,"This is a great adventure game. But if you are not very, very aware of every single thing you see you will miss something.There are parts of the game where if you do something wrong there is no 2nd chance. One thing I rate a game on is how easy it is to move around. On a rate from 1-5 this game gets a 2. The control is the mouse. After clicking where you want to go there is a very long delay. This can get very frustrating when you have to travel a long way.The acting could use some work but it is good to a point. What this game DOES have is very good graphics. You really feel like you are walking through a tomb. Good game I enjoyed it but you should wait til it is on sale."
2,Two of the most wonderful albums,"These are two of the most wonderful albums to come out of the mid-60's. I only wish I could say the same about this CD. After reading the other comments and reviews on this site I have to wonder if I purchased the only defective transfer to CD. The distortion is horrible and the levels are so all over the place that it boggles the mind. It is sad to have to settle for this. Perhaps, another company as a labour of love, will attempt this project again, giving it the quality control it so justly deserves."
2,roto tile bits,"roto tile bits will do a good job on thin ceramic tiles for cutouts-straight cuts are hard-thick tile,marble,etc-forget it--bits burn up quickly on cement backer board and at $5.99 are not cost effective. Buy a small diamond blade for your 4"" grinder--makita-dewalt etc. which are very effective, with a little practice they work fine--wear a dust mask and eye protection"
3,the end drags but the first half is solid,"i saw revis on tour with evanescence back in april 2003, and i grabbed their cd when it came out.i heard ""caught in the rain"" weeks ina dvance, so i was pretty cultured on the band and i really liked that songs catchiness.""your wall"" was song number two, and it became my favorite from the album.the guitar work complements the vocals tremendously well.""spin"" is the same driving rock song as ""your wall"".""seven"" breaks things down a little bit-you would think by the lyrics that this song would fit better as an album closer,but nonetheless a solid track.""straight jacket labels"" combines the tones of ""seven"" and smashes them head on with ""spin"" to make a very mellow verse, and rocking chorus.after that, the album kind of drifts away into a state of boredom, with everything sounding the same and no song sticking out or rocking out.overall, a decent pick up if you like bands such as fuel,tantric,and socialburn."
3,"Dreamy, catchy, but a tad boring","Places For Breathing by Revis is a good, solid, alt rock album. And the disc has cool dreamy sound effects which kinda put peaceful feelings in you. But unfortunatly, most of the songs dont really have a hook that pulls you in and keeps you listening. There are a couple of good ones on here though, these include Caught In The Rain, Seven, Your Wall,Spin, and Re Use. I'd recomend you listen for yourself and see what you think."
1,Oh please......,"Another overrated band that contributes to the lack of talent of today's alternative music. Revis sounds just like any other popular modern band. The first one that comes to mind is Creed. Why would a band want to sound like this? How many bands have you heard that try to sound exactly like Creed? Regardless, this band should make the most out of their success now because they won't keep it for long."
5,One of the most important people in Reggaeton!,"He is producer, rapper and singer and did a solid album with ""bad boy"". It`s a classic!"
5,A real good book for learning antenna theory,"This is a real excellent book for learning antenna theory. I enjoy this book very very much. By now I have not found for me another book that is better than this one, refer to antenna theory."
4,More fun in teenland,"Their sophomore effort is overall a fun ride, and contains some top notch moments like ""Tearproof"" and ""Wednesday Week"" -- songs that pinpoint that poignant yearning feeling of youth. And then there's the playful, self-mocking teen angst tunes like ""More songs about Chocolate and Girls"" and ""My Perfect Cousin"". It's similar to their first album, with some songwriting development. Great fun, really."
2,Be wary of listed strategies,"While this book has some valid accomodations and strategies, many of the listed ""strategies"" are not research- or evidence-based for improving the desired skills. They are simply 1.)restating what the child can not do (e.g. Reading Comprehension-Have the student read passages and answer questions about the passage), 2.)data-gathering activities (e.g.Make a list of those verb tenses the student most commonly uses incorrectly.), 3.)an activity that is either busy-work and/or not evidence-based for improving a skill (e.g.Have the student make a book of adjectives with one or two adjectives for each letter of the alphabet; Read a list of sentences with child's errors and have him make appropriate corrections orally.) Teachers, school administrators, and SLPs who are involved in response-to-intervention activities who use this book should do so with a critical eye."
2,You get what you pay for...maybe,"Staples are basically the same no matter which brand you buy. At least that's what I thought before opening the package. The box was broken, and so were half of the strips of staples. After taping the box back together, I put all the broken strips back in. I'm not sure why, but there was extra room in the box. I'm not going to count 5000 staples to see if I received what I paid for, but I won't buy this brand again. I have purchased Bostich staples also and did not have this problem with their product."
5,Some music you want to keep near you your whole life.,"Once in awhile you find some music you never outgrow or tire of...such as Ian & Sylvia. Their beautiful voices and lyrics still touch me as much now as they did several decades ago. ""Early Morning Rain"" and ""Four Strong Winds"" are two of the most moving songs ever written."
3,"Ship's a goin' down, ship's a goin' down...","This is the sound of a band dissolving before your ears, a band that decided to go out with not with a bang but with a fizzle. Ah but what a fizzle it is. It's truly timeless as other reviewers have pointed out. Timeless in that if you heard this thing without any foreknowledge you'd be surprised to find out it was recorded in 1974. But it's oddly incomplete and offhand sounding. Auteur Alex Chilton has lost his band and he's none too happy about it to the point where he sounds like he's beyond caring. Sister Lovers is beautiful in its own sparse and shambolic way but if you want to hear something a bit more cheery I suggest putting on some Radiohead. Big Star chose to go gently into that good night on a raft of despair, without hope and with precious little rock."
2,I just don't hear it,"I have seen that some of the reviewers of this, the Third release by Big Star, claim it to be a classic. A dark testimony of a troubled artist flipping the bird to his management and the record industry. I just don't get it. A fan of the first two Big Star releases and no stranger to dark and daunting works by other artists, all I get from this is a feeling that Alex Chilton laughs his heinie off everytime he cashes a royalty check from sales of this album. A collection of unfinished pieces, dirges, fair, but unspectacular covers and unfocused songs, I have tried numerous times to try to get into it's murk without success. It probably does an excellent job of showing the state of the artist at the time, but honestly, how many times do you go back and listen to this if you own it? If you come to this expecting a legendary work, take the time to preview this before parting with your hard earned money. Buyer beware!!"
3,Business sold to Bosch,"A very handy tool, but after occasional use the charger lights listed the batteries as bad. Looking for replacements discovered that Rotozip went out of business. They sold their name only to Bosch tools who redesigned it. Bosch will repair the old tools, but commented that they had few parts left."
3,"It'll do, if you've nothing better to do.","From this Author, I keep reading the same story over and other again. It's like she's phoning it in. The first story I read of her's was wonderful, so I made it a purpose to go and get titles written by her. Since I am a hopeless romantic, I shall probably read more of her work. Why do they use phrases like ""had been"" when they could just say ""was?"""
4,Great upbeat comfy read,"Sara Lewis has this great writing style - so immediately immersible, light, funny, and reassuring. I liked this book so much that I went back and got Heart Conditions and But I Love You Anyway. Do yourself a favor and read them all. I don't usually read ""light"" books...more typically I'm a fan of more heavy, ""literary"" stuff. However, I'm glad I discovered this author. Now, I only wish she'd write more, since I've exhausted her supply! There's also something inherently comforting about her writing. I love curling up every night with the familiar characters before I go to sleep. Just a terrific, absorbing read! And, actually, I think But I love You Anyway is my favorite book of hers...i'm still not finished with it, though, so that could change...read them all!"
1,Fake,Fake version of the mask. Beware of ordering online. I am really disappointed in this product. If I could rate it a zero I would.
2,Just OK,"I bought this because it got such rave reviews and it is an all-natural product (plus it wasn't very expensive).Based on the reviews I was expecting some amazing moisturizing, but I was very disappointed. I didn't think it conditioned any better than a regular bottle of conditioner. Also, I didn't like the smell at all. Smells like pantene and plastic.I tried it 3 times and will keep using it until it's empty but will certainly not purchase again.Too bad... I really wanted to like it. Still looking for a good hair masque..."
1,"not the fake stuff, but it just is not a good product","I will not order this again. It came in the same jar as pictured, so it's not a fake, but it seriously doesn't work. I thought i'd get soft hair, full of moisture, yet this does exactly what any conditioner - regular conditioner - will do. It's the same thing. It makes your hair soft while it's in your hair, but once it's out your hair will frizz and it will be worthless. Will keep searching for a better product that delivers as promised. I think the people who gave this good reviews probably were reviewing it based on how it is in wet hair in the shower, not the after effects. Not worth it for me."
1,"FAKE, DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER","I never write reviews for the products I buy on amazon, or online in general, but this one I just had to. The product smells completely different from a previous one that I had ordered for my girlfriend and I can assure you that the one I had before is 100% authentic. Checking previous reviews for this seller shows that it is not just me who have been sold fake products. BEWARE."
3,so-so,"this product is decent, made my hair softer, and smells good. but its little bit on a pricey side. and i felt like it only temporarily softened my hair... dunno if im gonna get it again"
5,The Best hair Product,I LOVE this hair product. This is the best thing I have ever had for my hair.My hair never looked so good!
4,It makes my hair really smooth.,"When I'm in the shower, I leave this on for about the recommended seven minutes. The time it takes for me to listen to two songs, basically. I would say that it's tougher to rinse out than normal conditioner, but not by enough that it matters. The masque makes your hair ridiculously smooth while in it and while it dries, but once it is dry, I don't see a huge difference. Maybe it's a long term thing."
3,Cute but they hurt my daughter's feet,"My daughter has average little girl feet. I think these run narrow. They are really cute & if your little girl has narrow feet-buy them. Otherwise, skip these ""ouchy"" shoes! Also, I think the elastic in the back was a little unforgiving on the backs of her heels."

3,Too Flexible,"For me this is a one star, but it is as advertised, Flexible! This has a short handle (6-3/4"") and a wide surface (5"" side to side). It's 4-1/2"" from front to back of the turner surface. So, it was the size I was looking for but it is way too flexible for me. It bends with a single egg on it. It's called the ""flexible"" turner and if you are going down the side of a 12"" cast iron pan to get under the side of a pancake it's great. It will go down and flex right under it. But getting it to the plate, you will have to take the pan to the plate and slide it out right onto the plate. The turner has no ridgitity at all."
2,Needs Better Glue,"I love almost all the Dye products I have used....except for one, these pods...The pods are nice and the one finger auto opening is great. But out of the 7 pods I bought i've had 2 that have had the lids pulled off when I tried to pull them from my pack, spilling my balls all over the field...Not what you want in the final game at a tourney...I have since gone back and replaced all the glue with stronger super glue and they seem to be doing better."
5,Does What Its Supposed To,"I've been using the Troll for several months now, and it does a very good job with 3/4"" mdf and ply. 4x8 sheets just do not have good handles on them and my arms are not 4 feet long. With this tool you stand them on their side, lift up a bit, slide it under and take off. You would think that maybe the wheels are a little small to get over obstructions, but the handle makes it easy to lift the wheels up and over, in fact most of the time I am using the Troll to carry the sheets without using the wheels anyway. The bottom rail is long enough to give you good balance. The outer edge of the rail is kicked up to keep the sheets from working their way off it. All in all, it does what it is designed to do very well and makes it tolerable for one person to handle big sheets."
4,Sexy shapeshifter seeks single sad soulmate,"Sorry for the title, I like alliteration. This is really more 3.5 stars. It's a really good book, and pretty good as romances go; very little sex/smut in this one. (Which doesn't necessarily make it good, as I usually read romances for the smut.) The shapeshifter aspect of this is what makes the book - the best romances have something BESIDES the romance going on, and this one does a good job. Maggie is a fun heroine and Julian is a little cookie-cutter, but he's a rich young widow, so who can blame him.The pregnancy thing was a little too forced, but I like that Maggie was honest about it, both with herself and Julian. I really wanted to see a lot more shapeshifting out of this book; the aspect was underplayed to the romance part, and just the hint of what Maggie and Marcus' shapeshifting sex life was like heated up the room. All in all, a good book; well written, goes down smooth, strong female character."
4,Excellent resource,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone studying terrorism. I used it as part of a bibliography for my final Army War College paper. Though the paper was about National Missile Defense, I found an incredible amount of data I could use. It is sober, insightful, and easy to read....unlike many books on the same topic. I have loaned my copy to other Army officers as a primer for curent events. Hope I get it back."
5,I wish I had bought this book.,"No- I did not buy this book. I bought and read two others on travel to Venezuela. If I had, I would not have been the victim of pickpocketting in Caracas. As a fellow traveller in Venezuela pointed out, this book describes verbatim my experience of ""being setup"" at an escalator in one of the metro stops specifically mentioned. For whatever reasons other reviewers may have for you not to buy this book, I can simply say: this book was right-on regarding crime in Caracas. The price of this book may save you $500 in cash, $1300 in fradulant credit card charges and alot of bad feelings toward a vacation you should not miss."
5,Superb remastering! CCM did it right for a change,"I am not a Les Elgart fan, so I have no knowledge about the particular period of his life that he produced and arranged the best jazz-band music. Based on the performance of this CD (my first Elgart CD), I am very impressed by the vivid rhythmic energy, the superb jazz musicianship of the musicians (ensemble, intonations, rhythm, balance), the simplistic yet detailed orchestrations (especially the skillful use of the brass and woodwind instruments for various rhythmic and solo instrumentation) in spite of the absence of the piano.Although Collector's Choice Music (CCM) is not a reissuing record label that is famous for superb digital remastering of albums (of different genres) from yester years, the sonic quality of this CD is suprisingly good and dynamic! I have quite a few CDs of the same genre that are remastered by CCM. When the remastering is poor, the performances often end up sounding like elevator music or Muzak you hear in the supermarkets."
3,I Agree With Joseph E. Billman,"The earlier Elgart stuff doesn't quite grab you the way their early sixties recordings do. I for one highly recommend the CD entitled ""Best of the Big Bands, Volume 1"" which was recorded in the early sixties and is currently available. Some fine interpretations of classic big band themes with the unmistakeable Elgart touch (prominent bass trombone, guitar in lieu of piano, Larry's captivating, incomparable lead alto and solo voice). If only SOMEONE would reissue the great material that Larry recorded for MGM under his own name (e.g. ""The City"")."
5,Happy with purchase,"This book arrived very quickly. It has been gently used,but is in great shape and my son doesn't have to lug this text book home from school."
4,My Daughter Loves this game,"I have to say I was surprised, but my daughter just loves this game... of course she is 1 and likes to use the box to stand on and dance on. Sometimes she uses it as a little chair and sometimes as a step to reach things she's not supposed to touch.After playing the game twice I never thought it would escape the trash bin, but 24 the DVD game is now one of my duaghter's favorite toys.***Clearly, my husband hijacked my account here. So sorry. The game does totally suck, though."
2,poorly designed,"Controls are very slow, some times just have to press buttons randomly and wait for it to respond; not too much thinking involved either. Still, it's 24! (that's why I gave it two stars). Definitely will not play again once I beat it."
1,"Awful, avoid at all costs.","DO NOT BUY!! With such a concept, we suspected the game would be fun. Oh how wrong we were. At first we thought we just didn't have quick enough fingers to make it past some of the security cameras and to win the minigames. Nope, the game itself just likes to take it's time reacting. We spent the whole ""24 hours"" just trying to make it through a couple of the sections, I have no idea how you'd finish the game in the time given. The ""board"" isn't even really used and the clues don't help at all, most of the information was given at other points in the game.We played with a friend who has never watched 24. Needless to say, she doesn't ever have a desire to watch the show after this.Jack's on his own to stop these terrorists because as much as we tried to help, we're useless to him (and he certianly let's you know it when time runs out).This game has a mind of it's own, it's like it wants you to fail."
1,Avoid this product,"I bought this product on a whim, thinking I could use to re-enforce my ""guitar for dummies"" knowledge.While the cover looks exciting (play along with the band, many views of the guitar, etc.), once you load the product and start trying to use it to learn is when you realize how badly you want to get your money back.I think the biggest complaint, is that there is no order on the lessons. There is a table of contents, but nothing even remotely indicating ""start here and go in this direction"". It is the most unorganized piece of software I have ever purchased.Save your money, and run away from this product."
5,great Tool,"I read all the other reviews and do no it share the sentiment. I found it to be a great tool. i use it for everything i would normally use my jig saw for. I find it to be great on plywood, drywall, plaster, vinyl siding, and pine, and just about everything else. I haven't touched my jig saw since purchasing the Rotozip about a year ago. I think that's too bad about the folks who have bad luck with it but to each their own i guess. Good luck all!"
3,doesn't fit the original u have to call,Doesn't fit the original. I believe there are parts missing because it doesn't fit my rotozip.IF YOU CALL them they will sent the right adapter for free.Have not used it yet but it looks like it will work.
1,Save your money,"If you are looking for a book just to give you some ideas on different home designs, then this book might be useful.If however, your thinking of actually purchasing plans from this book, DON'T!!!The companies represented are not exactly full of integrity and do not fulfill their promises of what you will recieve for your money.The plans that I have seen are not nearly complete enough to be of any realistic use.The best way I could describe this whole operation is to call it a ""Dairy Farm"", looking for ways to entice you to spend a large amount of money only to discover you have to spend a good deal more to get what they already promised you in your original purchase. It's a very flaky set-up, and you will find their representatives less than helpful."
1,1001 All Time Best Selling Home Plans,"This book was cumbersome to say the least. When looking for a plan I narrowed down my wants to 1) Garage not facing the street 2) 3800 sq feet and up 3) Master Suite very large. After that I found several plans, and pondered them down to my dream house. Then I ordered the plan, spent $1200 and got absolutely nothing useful. These plans are not as advertised. One cannot actually build a house from the prints that are bought. My many phone calls were not returned, the company rep angrily argued with my contractor, my money was not returned and I was lightly threatened. Overall, the plans are nice to look at with a magnifying glass, but performance of promises is nil. I know that my dream house was dashed by this book."
5,love,This is such a funny and clever movie and I love that it was only five dollars. Worth every penny!
3,Its okay,Got this for my grandkids for the holidays. They seem to like it okay but its not a favorite of mine.
2,Eh.,Started out pretty good but then it went on a tangent about bees suing people (and apparently U.S. courts effect THE ENTIRE WORLD) and I just lost interest in it at this point.
1,Surprisingly B-movie-ish,"I wanted to like this movie. The premise wasn't bad, and it seemed like it would be a fun, lighthearted romp. It wasn't. Sure, there were a few chuckles, but mostly it was long periods of boredom interspersed with areas of preaching. I don't mind if movies have a moral, but the aim should be to subtly weave it through an otherwise interesting story. This movie failed on the subtle front as well as the interesting front.I can't see myself recommending this movie to anyone. There are far better animated movies out there - spend your time watching one of them."
1,what the ??,I do not understand why such great talents such as Jerry S. and Renee Z. would waste their time with such a horrible movie. I usually like all of the animated movies but this is awful
2,Depressing movie with confussing messages,"This movie was so weak. Jerry Seinfeld, who I love, is the main character. Unfortunately, his humor didn't carry the movie for me. He plays a bee who becomes obsessed with the knowledge that humans are taking all their hard made honey. He goes to court and wins all the honey back. As a result, the bees stop working, flowers aren't pollinated, everything on the planet is dying.So what is the moral? Is it wrong to steal others work, is it wrong to sue, is it wrong to relax when all the work has already been done? There were just a lot of confusing messages and very few positives.It was a depressing movie with an ugly court case, like we needed another one of those. I have no desire to ever see this movie again."
5,Awesome!,I have nothing to say except my son LOVES this movie and I do too. If you have a kid like mine that likes to watch the same movie over and over again this one is great because it isn't annoying!
4,Fun for the whole family,"This movie was so enjoyable! We watched it together as a family and all enjoyed it. It wasn't the deeply moving experience that NEMO was for me, but it is great entertainment with ""meat"". My boys (ages 3 and 5) loved the animation, the music, and some of the humor. Thankfully, there was a lot of quintessential Jerry Seinfeld humor for us, as well as great stuff for the kids. Yeah, it's far-fetched, but aren't most animated movies? It's got a good message,too - several of them. It's real message is about the balance of nature and how our actions truly affect the whole of creation/nature. It's also about finding your passion and pursuing it. And lastly, it's about how sometimes you find true friends in the most unlikely places! ENJOY!"
5,Color Harmony,"What a wonderful book. Color choices, harmony, placement and proportion - when the quilt is about color vice pattern harmony really matters. Well thought out, consistent content and lots of choices. This book is for those who love color, as well as those who intuitively work well with color but do not understand why. From novice to expert this is a book worth keeping in your personal library - - you will go back again and again!"
4,This book was very helpful,I really liked this book. I could look through it and find exactlly what I was looking for without having to even read what the chapter was. It was very useful because of my science projet. I had to do a research paper and it was very hard to find information that I could understand but this book was very clear.
3,4 pannel Screen,"The box was damaged when I received it,as a result there was a ding on the wood of the screen. I did not have the energy to go through the return process so I chose to keep it. Better packaging would have prevented that. The screen is not very stable and does not stay upright very well. Would not recommend."
5,Just the right thing,"I ordered a 4-panel screen o serve as a space divider and privacy screen for some open areas in our home. We wanted to have it on hand for when guests came, but we like it so much that we find places to keep it on display all the time. Sturdy, beautiful, and easy to move around."
3,Shoji screen that has gaps,"I bought the cherry 4-panel but the color was too red and didn't match the interior. The gaps in between the panels are a little big, so there is no complete privacy."
5,Don't Let the High Price Tag Turn You Away,"I must admit it was sticker shock at first when we came upon the Performer. Other charcoal grills were much cheaper, especially at the 'club' stores, but taking Weber's reputation into consideration along with the grills' warranty we decided to purchase the Performer. Assembly was hassle-free. I was intimidated by the cooking instructions at first but once you start following along it all makes sense. We purchased the hardwood charcoal based on another raters recommendation and love it. The food cooked on the Weber Performer is fabulous!I cannot get over the difference in taste along with how moist the meat is if you follow the directions; don't pierce the meat, don't cook without the lid and let the food rest for a few minutes after removing from grill. That's all it takes to have a great meal. Clean up is simple, too. I don't know why I'd ever want to use a regular old gas grill again."
5,For the Grilling Challenged,"I love this grill! My biggest problem with charcoal grilling has always getting the charcoal lit. This solves the problem! I have made complete dinners on the grill, and know that I'm ""Cooking"" because the thermometer on top tells me at a glance that it's hot enough. I don't care for gas grilling, not the same taste. I get a great charcoal taste and get the big advantage of having gas to light my fire!"
4,critical mess,"Wind on the water is an album with 5 or 6 very good songs, but somewhere in the middle the album has some less interesting songs on it. Songs like Mama Lion, Bittersweet, Homeward Through The Haze en definitely To The Last Whale... are that good that it diserves the fourth star.The duo-albums within the CSNY-colaboration are often better than the ones they've made with the three/four of them in a later stage.In conclusion: a good band, a lot of good songs, but also some things that are less interesting. Being a fan of CSN, and not owning Wind On The Water would be a bit strange, but when you own the box with the best of CSN(Y), you can do without it, for the best songs of the album you can find there to."
4,Wind on the Water,"I've always loved this recording. It shows in many ways how stiffled these two guys were in CSN&Y. The Intro to the song Wind On the Water, which I believe is, To the Last Whale & Wind on the Water it self are both hauntingly beautiful. Also Crosby's 'Carry Me' is just a great song both musically and lyrically."
4,The Crosby and Nash duo teams up for a second album,"""Wind on the Water"" was the second album that David Crosby and Graham Nash recorded together, coming after the first CSN&Y reunion tour tour (how many have there been now?). This 1975 album is on a par with their self-titled first effort, but is not quite as good as the stellar solo albums each produced during that time. Crosby and Nash always had the virtue of bringing out the best in each other and that is the case here. Their two-part harmonies work, from the opening track ""Carry Me"" to ""Homeward Through the Haze"" and ""Naked in the Rain."" Of course, there are also background vocals from the likes of James Taylor, Carole King and Jackson Browne, which just goes to prove the more the merrier. ""Wind on the Water"" is nicely bookended by the two most substantive songs in terms of the lyrics, ""Carry Me"" and ""To The Last Whale: A. Critical Mass and B. Wind on the Water."" This is just a solid little album of rich melodies and solid vocal harmonies."
1,Should be banned by the SPCA,"Anyone seriously interested in listening to this tripe should save their money and spend it on something more worthwhile, like a donation to their local animal shelter, or homeless shelter, for that matter. Yoko Ono's music always has and always will sound like someone gutting a still living cat."
1,Power adapter stinks,"This unit suffers from the probles ALL HP notebooks.The reciever which you connect the power to is a peace of junk.It is made from brittle plastic designed to break if it comes under too much stress.Good idea, but stupid implementation!You have to replace the WHOLE system board if it breaks! HP wants $600 for a new system board! When I told HP parts that, they said ""Oh let me transfer you to sales!""Yea right!I took it to a local shop for someone to replace the broken reciever and they told me that HP is the worst about the power recievers!Never buy an HP! <delete><delete><delete><delete> Always buy an HP! Want to buy mine? Cheap?"
3,Pamphlet-writer still fooling many,"1. Ajami is a Lebanese Arab who moved to the US at 18, and who holds US Citizenship. In this context he is about as ""neutral"" a source as Zbigniew Brzezinski is with respect to NATO enlargment into Poland.2. Did you know that all those troops were heading off to the Gulf to give ""gifts"" to Arabs, who already collect $bn's in USD every year from the US Treasury?3. Or were you one of those nice folks who thought they were sent in to save your babies from mushroom clouds?And finally,4. Will Americans ever learn to spot the Belgian Nun?"
2,"Old Technology, Mediocre Interactivity",The good thing: Lots of pictures.The bad things:All the pictures are of fairly low quality.The CD ROM was built for Windows 3.1 so the interface is clunky.(No nice Marcomedia director stuff here.)The tone is for a junior high school student.Random access is possible but not complete: Much of the information is in the walk through slide show with commentary.Summary: Most worthwhile as an artifact of CD ROM media in it infancy.
3,Interesting Shading to Tiresome,"In the introduction, the author, Ed Kugler, claims ""it's the best damned Nam book you'll ever read!"" Well, maybe. But even the ""best damned"" of anything gets tiresome after awhile. Admittedly, Ed tells a good tale of his coming of age in Nam as a Marine sniper while learning to lead the ""good guys"" of his side, and kill the ""bad guys"" of the other side. It's told with the unflagging energy and Weltanschauung of a 20-year old. But that's the problem. The book was published in 1999, presumably recently written by the author while in his early 50's. Until the epilogue, I didn't see any evidence of wisdom accumulated in the three decades since Nam that might have otherwise tempered his narrative. Too bad, since Ed has been at the top management levels of both PepsiCo and Compaq Computer Corporation. I mean, he must have grown up just a little since the 60's, right? Ed, I'm in my 50's too, and your book left me none the wiser from your experience."
1,Boring,"I've read many books on sniping. This is about the most boring. What the author did in the war was very brave and honourable. I am commenting on the writing style of the book , not his actions. Fighting men who bleed and fought for their country should be honoured and revered."
5,Excellent - really real,"I just finished reading the book this morning having started it yesterday morning. I couldn't put the book down! I love how the author showed the importance of patience and a sense of humor to a sniper. He also clearly showed what would happen to snippers if they weren't patient (which he wasn't on more than one occaision). I liked how the author wasn't afraid to tell of his own mistakes and the mistakes of his buddies. It is sad that the Vietnam Vets weren't treated the way they should have been: with respect and love (like the WWII Vets). I think that this should be required reading for US history students in high school. So the language is a little crude, everybody knows those words by then. :)"
2,Expected Better Quality,"Andersen and Grimm are supposed to be classics. While I like having the collection and while the illustrations are very nice - the pages themselves are much closer to newspaper-stock than what I'd expect from a durable, long-lasting book. Very thin, gritty, and easily tearable. It was kind of disappointing. This also applies to the Grimm book from the same editor."
5,A very good breed standard...,"Ms. Terry continues her Chihuahua journey from ""The Chihuahua"" to this more detailed tome. I, as a handler, breeder and show person in several breeds really like this book. It gives some of the basics a beginner would need, but also take us further into this tiny body and lets us see that, just because they weigh in at 3-4+- pounds there is still a LOT of dog there. Worth the purchace and I highly recomend it."
4,history,This book was interesting to our family as William Paul Whitsett was a relative and we greatly enjoyed reading about some of the family members in the past. I am not sure others with no connection to or knowledge would find the same level of interest. Possibly they could still enjoy the history of the development of southern /California area and the bringing of water from the Colorado river.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE FLOORING STAPLES!,"I opened up the box from amazon to find a vastly smaller box inside that had been damaged and the box of 5,000 staples was busted open and the racks were all broken up into small pieces. This was not as upsetting as the following. I installed a 600 sq ft wide plank maple floor and found out that the orange glue that binds the staples together to form a rack was so thick I ended up taking my thumb and rubbing the rest off of the head of the staple once it was driven into the plank. Those staples that had no so much glue on them eventully had a glue sliver poke up between the planks in rare instances. So I ended up taking a razor knife and cutting them out very carefully as not to scratch the planks. I LOST A LOT OF PRODUCTIVITY ON THIS JOB thinking I was saving money on the price of flooring staples compared to Lowes or Home Depot. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND BUY THE BOSTICTCH BRAND STAPLES! Never again will I buy these staples."
1,Bad dispenser,"I had used this product in other packages and it was ok, but this tube dispenses a large amount of product each time and is uncontrollable. If you really want this product I would get a different package. I went back to using Perrigo Trolamine Salicylate 10% as it has no odor and works better."
5,AWESOME,"Studio quality is MUCH better, and they seem more structured about being chaotic! Really nice hooks, I also think it has a super high re-playablitly rating. I love this album. I think it's fantastic. It's so plaful sounding, yet they throw ""one two"" beats all over the place. You mat really enjoy the singer's voice, really cute sounding, like if it's a pokemon character, guitar does some amazing effects, (try to think SIMILAR to r.a.t.m.) and the bass lines are GREAT. i really enjoy them. drums aren't super technical, but it's not simple beats either... hope this helps!"
5,A one man operation.,"I am very surpise to find a item that works as well as you want it to. I am drywalling my house by myself. Being in the trades for forty years, you find that some times it's best to do your own work. The only problem is in a hall way, the unit base is app. fifty three inchs. The easy of fitting a ceiling panel is worth buying the unit alone. Now if it could only tape the joints."
3,no devanagari,"To my disappointment this book has no devanagari script but roman transliteration.To my pleasure I have Arthur Mc Donnell's Practical Dictionary.It has devanagari for the main word, and the derivations from the main word do not have devanagaris.I think Sanskrit Wörterbuch may help accelerate finding the words by using Latein umschrift.I have also bought Otto von Böhtlink's Sanskrit Wörterbuch in kurzerer Fassung recently from Amazon.de"
2,Not as much of a program as advertised,"This program leaves quite a bit to be desired. It does not break down a project by hour which is sometimes very handy dealing with a small project or one that has many at a facets per day. The tutorials fairly good but it still leaves something to be desired in the finance area. I have not been able to find any way to add materials or cost of machinery or services other than labor.I have had to resort returning to an old program that I bought a number of years ago called Project Manager by Softkey.Tom Walker, Arizona"
2,"Don't buy this, you won't be happy with it","Really Poor Graphics and really cheap presentation. Felt Cheap all around. Didn't hold my interest, so I fast forwarded to all the dinosaur scenes, but even they were so cartoony feeling, that I really can't recommend this to anyone."
3,Paleoindian Book,"I was really looking forward to this addition to my early American library. Fortunately I ""Looked Inside"" at the Table of Contents and Index and was very surprized to find no mention of the Atlatl, the major hunting weapon used by Paleo people the world over. Predating the bow and arrow by thousands of years. Not only artifacts but wonderful petroglyphs in the US Southwest. A simple but most effective weapon still used by the Aboriginal people in Australia's Outback as well as well as South American Indians for large fish in the Andean lakes and by Alaskan natives for seal.Maybe I missed something.Barry VanWinkle"
4,Very Good Except,"This tool does the job very well and is very intuitive. I had perfectly fit riser/tread in 45 mins. This can make for building a set of stairs quickly. The only thing with it is that some of the 'stays' are plastic. I had one break after it fell off the table saw. My fault for dropping it. Next time I use it I will mill up some new ones out of aluminum or a hard wood. Great tool, very useful"
5,The wizard is magic!,"For a ""closed"" stairwell this tool cannot be beat. I have used several different tread jigs and have never created a better (or faster) product easier than with the wizard. Well made and collapsable for easy storage, this jig is by far a the best stair tool I have used."
3,1st Sandra Brown...too many cliches,It was mildly entertaining although filled with cop and romance cliches. Here are couple of the biggest cliches: a by the book cop basically falls in love with a suspect upon first sight of her then risks life and career for her and a partner that idolizes her partner but suddenly doesn't trust his judgement involving suspect. If he's such a great cop then why would his partner and his commander ask him if he can be objective. Are we to believe that he's willing to throw life and career out the window for love of a married woman that he knows nothing about?
4,Another Great One From Brown,"I really enjoyed this book. The mystery and intrigue kept building up and building up, and just when you think you have enough questions left unanswered, even more arise as events take place.The surprises and twists kept coming until the very end. Great read."
2,Not one of her best,"I have read all of Sandra Brown books.I was disappointed in this one. I havealmost all of her books in my bookcase,but when I finished this one I gave itaway."
3,Cliffs notes do not do it for me,"Perhaps I am just being prudish, but it seems to me that one should be glad for the opportunity to read Shakespeare as a requirement for school. Cliifs' Notes, as widely used as they are, do not give anything close to the sense of the unique genius of classic authors, one of whom is the unparalled William Shakespeare."
1,NOT FOOD GRADE,"Despite what it says, 8% H2O2 is not food grade hydrogen peroxide. Look for 35% H2O2. If you're looking for water storage peroxide like I am, do not get this."
4,Xmas with JJW,"Always liked Jerry Jeff's live act so when I saw this Xmas album I knew I had to have it. Nothing fancy just JJW's laid back interpretation of well known holiday songs, harmless and fun.Merry Christmas to all your older Gonzo brothers and sisters"
4,A good place to start,"The author doesn't claim this is an exhaustive or authoritative study of the esoterica of Qabalah which, as Lon DuQuette has said, will ""count the nostril hairs of God."" But for those trying to get their bearings, especially in the hermetic application of Qabalah, this is a good start. The rituals are less than perfect; they taste rather of ""new age"" instead of true ceremonial qabalism. But you can ignore them and substitute your own or those of the myriad other authors who have written on the subject, from Crowley to Regarie to Mathers. Start here; there is much more complex and confusing material you can puzzle on later.If you're a hard core Thelemite looking for an accessible basic intro to Qabalah, stick with ""The Chicken Qabalah"" by Lon DuQuette. It's much funnier and more relevant to Thelema."
3,Disappointing when wide open,"This is a very decent lens, but my images are very soft if I open it up to 5.6 or wider and I'm zoomed in beyond 70mm or so. I'm using a Canon 20D. Images are sharp when I close up the aperture or zoom out. I actually sent the lens back to Tokina for repair. The technician read me a document he had which states that the lens was made for film, not digital, and that we could not expect optimal results from the lens when used with a digital camera when the aperture was opened up."
3,Michael fans of the eighties,"Okay, folks, like a lot of books from the eighties eras written about michael, basically they're the same thing. the authors seem to copy each other. so basically this book is like Mark Bego's books about Michael. The cover is of Michael in the Beat It Jacket. with like blue lights gleaming all on the cover."
1,Confused.........,"I am a potential buyer of this Crain Cutter 810H Super door Jamb saw kit, but I am confused. This is not the same saw that is in my Toolcrib Catalog for October, 2000. Please explain this to me, as I would like to know what I am going to get if I should decide to order this saw. Thanks Ron Mueller"
2,Cannot view English subtitles,"The Amazon description says ""Format: Subtitled, NTSC"" but I could not figure out how to turn on the English subtitles when viewing this on my computer. I'm searching the internet for answers. If anybody knows, please feel free to post here. I hope its something simple, even if that makes me feel like an idiot."
4,A must for OpenGL programmers,"This book is a must for those wanting to fully exploit the power of OpenGL. In this 3rd Edition, the authors have included the newest features of OpenGL, Version 1.2. In particular, the discussion about multitexturing and imaging subset deserves a special mention, since they represent the latest rendering techniques available in form of a standard library.Although all features, from the most basic to the most advanced technique, are covered in this book, it is not an introductory graphics text book. Readers should have a basic knowledge about computer graphics in order to benefit from this book. Also, it is useful to be familiar with 2D/3D geometry and other graphics libraries. As code fragments and samples are written in C, experience with this programming language is also required.I recommend this book for any serious OpenGL programmer, perhaps complemented with the ""OpenGL Reference Manual"" and ""Programming OpenGL for the X Window System"" by Mark Kilgard."
1,"This book is out of print, get the 6th edition instead","This book is out of print. Get the new editionOpenGL(R) Programming Guide: The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL(R), Version 2.1 (6th Edition) (OpenGL)instead. I was on the wait queue for restocking for a month before I realized my mistake."
5,BEAUTIFUL BOOK BUT NOT BABY -PRESCHOOL,"THIS IS A LOVELY BOOK WITH CREAM COLORED PAGES, A RIBBON AND WONDERFUL ILLUSTRATIONS. IT IS NOT HOWEVER ""BABY PRESCHOOL""It is for older readers. Nice translation from the German."
4,A beautiful book,"This is a fantastic resource filled with great examples of handmade design masterpieces. There are a few sections of illustrations that are already starting to look very dated, but a lot of the featured designs are timeless in their inginuity and beauty.Whether you are already using hand-made techniques in your work, or you are searching for some inspiration on how you can get a more hands-on tactile feel with your designs in this age of InDesign, Photoshop and stock graphics, this book is great."
4,good mask,works great. has a snug feel. i can keep it on for about an hour and then if i can ill take it off for a minute. not too uncomfortable.only ships with one set of filters.
4,rainbow man,look all i said was i paid more for this last copy than the first copy i bougth . SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD
4,Fun retro stuff,A good piece of midlife rock n roll.Nice oldfashioned production. Fine songs. Brilliant Springsteen renditions.
5,A simpliest book that probes the inner conscience of man,The essance of Camus is well written in this book. It probes the conscience of man. It deals with the guilt and punishment of guilt. Similar to Crime and Punishment.
3,Am I missing Something?,"""The Fall"" was my introduction to Camus. I believed it was high time that I read the work of this Nobel Laureate and, so, in I dived.I regret to say that I was disappointed. Camus' short work is a monologue from its principal character, Jean-Batiste Clamence, who serves as the narrator of the tale. First person grammar is used to tell what can best be described as a very meandering story. To use the term plot would be unfair. The book simply has little or no such plot.Now, it is probably quite unfair to come to a sweeping conclusion on the basis of one short work. The work of Camus is widely praised. Many people deem him to be one of the literary giants of the twentieth century. So, it is incumbent on me to read further into the work of Camus. I trust that my efforts will be rewarded in due course. For the moment, I feel somewhat cheated."
4,Far from the best of Camus,"This is the Camus novel I least like. It has a bleakness about it. The judge- penitent Jean- Baptiste Clamence who tells of his own fall from a position of moral superiority to one of what seems to be nihilistic lostness speaks it seems to himself for himself. Unlike Camus greatest work ' The Plague' there is no sense of other live and interesting characters, no sense of a social world. All is enclosed in upon the narrator himself who has lost his way in a world which seems devoid of grace and joy and love.This was for me the most discouraging of all the works of Camus I have read. For even Sisyphus with the rock rolling down time and time again has the decision of whether to begin rolling it up again. Here the narrator seems to surrender completely to the void of his own fallen world."
3,Behind the Mohegan Laker I stand; The Fall is decent.,"The format of the book--a monologue--was interesting, and the philosophy expressed was worthwhile, but the book itself was stilted. I don't regret reading it, but I wouldn't read it again; The Stranger, and The Plague, were far more worthwhile and gripping."
2,"Unchain the melody, PLEASE!","I originally had just wanted a good recording of the Righteous Brothers' ""Unchained Melody,"" but purchased GHOST on the basis of several of the rave reviews below. Mssr Jarre is obviously a talented composer, but the two renditions of ""Unchained Melody"" are really the only things on the disk that I can stand. The rest of the selections are quite cacophonous and unmelodic; the music works fine on screen to convey tension, fear, dementia, etc., but it's not what I would ever choose to listen to. If you're like me and have a hard time appreciating much of modern ""classical"" music, you'd be much better off just buying a Righteous Brothers CD - ""Unchained Melody"" really is a slow-dance classic."
5,"Short soundtrack, but powerful...","Good things do come in small packages! This soundtrack is a masterpiece, despite it's only a shade over 35 minutes in play time. I think the thing to really point out with this recording is its perfect support of the movie's storyline. I've seen plenty of movies and listened to plenty of soundtracks in my days, but rarely do a movie and soundtrack have the synergy these two have together.I really like to turn off the lights, light a few candles, relax in my recliner and put in this soundtrack. Tears still well in my eyes because of the sheer beauty of the music. I hope you've had the chance to experience the same feeling. It is a wonderful thing!"
4,myself,"I love the romantic music, I do not care so much for the rest, but of course that is the way it should be."
3,LACKING FEATURE AND MISREPRESENTED,"THE ITEM WAS DESCRIBED BY CONAIR AS WITH 3 HEAT AND 2 SPEED SETTINGS. WHEN I RECEIVED IT , IT ONLY HAD 2 HEAT SETTINGS (NO COLD) AND 2 SPEED SETTING. IT HAS A BUTTON FOR COLD BLAST BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE CHOICE TO RUN COLD HEAT WITHOUT PUSHING AND HOLDING A BUTTON."
2,Not Really Worth It,"This guide contains 34 short pages, 18 of which are actually about designing and building a winning car. Regrettably, while the information it contains is useful, there are no winning ideas in it which you can not easily find for free on several websites. I was hoping for more.I'd say save your money unless you have no access to the web, (but then in that case how are you reading this?)."
1,"Brilliant allbum, dreadful CD","One of the truly great albums of its time brought to its knees by the absolutely awful sound quality of this re-issue. Why, why, why? This is unlistenable. My advice, buy a turntable then hunt out the album, which I think is what I'll do."
3,Just a little bit boring,"I love ancient history and found the book interesting, but just a little bit stale."
5,"""Every song sounds like a single"" said Brian ""Big Bass"" Gardner.","Too bad this band broke-up right after finishing their debut CD! Featured appearances on the CD, mixed by Big Bass himself, Nate Morton and Josh Freese, two of the top drummers in the Biz. Chris Fogel did some of the mix. (He did Alanis' first and second albums as well as Seal's stuff).After breaking up, the guys from the band are now TaTu, playing with those Russian Girls who have sold millions of records.THE NEGATIVE REVIEW SEEN HERE IS FROM A GUY IN LA WHO DIDN'T TRADEMARK HIS BAND'S NAME, WHICH WAS ALSO ""DRIVEN"". HE WAS UPSET AND SO HE LEFT THIS NONSENSE REVIEW. LISTEN FOR YOURSELF. GREAT MUSICIANS, MIXERS AND SINGER."
2,Lisa Simspon in an odd role,"There's not a lot to say about this film. It tries to be a comedy, then it tries to be a 'true-life' style drama, and it never really succeeds at either. And it has Yeardley Smith, the actress who does the voice of cartoon Lisa Simpson, briefly topless. The film kept me interested enough to watch the whole thing, but probably not enough to watch it again."
2,Didn't work for my bad bunions.,"It took a few days to get used to them, and it made wearing most of my shoes unbearable. They did put some strain on my smaller toes rather than relieve my bunion as well. No sooner than I got used to them did they no longer hold their shape, and on the last day I wore them I had to laugh when I took them off to find that they were squished like little slivers and did nothing to hold my toes apart! They were cheap enough to try. Maybe they would work better for lesser bunions."
3,Getting Streetsmart - your money better spent elsewhere,"The first half of this book did an admirable job of introducing the reader to various stock valuation terminology & methodology.Unfortunately, the second half of the book focused almost solely on explaining, applying, and encouraging the purchase of their stock valuation software. Without this software, the second half of the book is somewhate limited in its value and use.The book's not a total loss, thanks to the first half, but is probably a better exercise in ""book valuation"". This one's valuation falls somewhere short of its purchase price. If it were a stock and I were to apply the owners valuation principles, it might be best to pass on buying it...Hope this helps! Cheers!"
5,My inquiring mind found out,"when I read that Carlos Santana asked Cindy to marry him I was shocked. I never knew that he and deborah had divorced. I felt a personal connection with Deborah. After I read this book I saw what she had gone through. I hope that she will always be happy, ahe and her childen."
5,Great Experience,The item came earlier than expected and was what was asked for. Would use the same vendor again.
3,Outdated print - lack of color illustrations,This is my first book on cabinet door and drawer building and I must say I wasn't impressed. The print is way outdated - not in the classic woodworking techniques - but in presentation. Washed out black and white photos that barely show the beauty of wood? You've got to be joking. The only color you'll see in this book is on its front and back. Page 85 (bottom pic) shows author's left hand barely an inch from his table saw's rotating blade as he demonstrates a plunge cut. I hope he still has all of his fingers. I am keeping the book for a basic joinery reference.
5,Best game!,"It's Way Better Than the first Driver.Actually It's Better Than any game!I mean You get to get out of your car and into other cars,(stealing)."
2,Player of games,I purchased three of these for two young men. The first one played great but the next one had a glitch that caused the game to freeze up. Because it was used I returned it thinking it was a problem with the disc even though it looked good. But guess what...the next one I ordered had the same issue...freezing up while driving making the game unplayable. I would not purchase this game...nothing more disappointing than anticipating playing a game and it won't play.
2,"Two thumbs down, and Infogrames had one up their A#*!","The frame rate is realy bad, and the pop up is pure death! Auto Destruct was a good game, it came out in 1997, but it didn't have this much damn pop up! The first Driver felt like it was based in th 70s, but this felt like it was based in the 90s, but with 70s cars. It's just ugly! I'll sell it, if I can find anyone who wants it!"
2,"Good points, and Bad points","The idea behind the game is very good, and I believe that we will see great games like this in the fuure. Indeed, i would like to see a game that essentially combines a Driver type game with a flight simulator, providing a more thorough 'life' simulation. At any rate, I feel that Driver 2 was a rather sloppy release. The graphics are not very sharp, the popup makes it very hard to see what is not so far ahead of you. Many of the missions are so difficult, that I had to attempt them 20 or 30 times before I was lucky enough to finish them. Needless to say, I still have not gotten to Rio or Vegas... what they really lack here, I believe, is a setting for difficulty levels. The game is perpetually on 'Extreme'. Personally, I like a game to be challenging, as well as fun. I do not find Driver 2 to be fun."
3,This Game,"This game, is a good game but it is easy to crash and run out of gas. It also takes a long time to fill up. It takes many restarts and the game is realy hard on easy. but if you liek easy games go play pac man... But they are more games a lot funner."
2,"Good game, bad graphics","I like the game and how you can get out of your car and all, but the graphics are terrible, they are just awful, and I'm using them on a PS2, and it also runs slow."
2,One Size does not fit all.,"I purchased this product because I don't like neck straps. When I got it, the strap that wraps around the wrist was quite small. It would have been nice to have the actual dimensions listed."
3,"Entertaining, nothing more","To put it plainly, the book is entertainment and nothing more. On the minus side, it is full of coincidences that just don't happen in real life -- without these coincidences, the story would have held fine, but it just wouldn't have been as ""cute"".On the plus side, the writing style is very fluid and entertaining, the characters mostly very realistic. The style keeps you going on the next chapter, even though you should have been asleep half an hour ago. It's easy reading, great for lounging by the pool or ocean. Don't expect too much, and you'll be entertained.This book has a headliner (I believe that's what they call one-line ""reviews"" from popular newspapers or critics, that are printed on the back cover) that is about a different book by the same author -- which I find totally rediculous. Had I noticed it before starting to read, I probably would have put the book aside..."
1,Guaranteed to make a Scrooge out of you,"In recent years I've found myself growing unaccountably grouchy as Christmas approaches. Finally, I figured out the problem: my wife played this CD. The Roches have only one volume, loud. They make no effort to blend their voices. They don't always stay on key. They don't try to capture the spirit of any of their songs, singing everything in the same top-of-the-lungs way. Listening to this CD is like nothing so much as being in attendance during the third hour of a kid's birthday party, when the kids are hitting the wall with sugar and fatigue and the screams grow out of control."
4,Me gusta,"Fue algo que compre para hacer juego a un set de fichas y me parece bastante bueno, es una excelente opción para las partidas con los amigos."
3,You get what you pay for,Quality is very low. Creases hard to get rid of. Printing was smudged. Recommend spending a little more to get something better.
3,Fairly Funny,Quick read and rather crude drawings. I especially like the drawing on the cover. It is fairly funny but will then collect dust...
1,disappointed,"Front cover had a rip and a sticky black residue on it. I was able to wash it off, but 'very good' condition is not how we received the book."
5,"Absolutely, the most user friendly tool for sign language",The most simple way to learn easy and more difficult signs. This book makes it so easy to dive into a world of communication where too few have gone before. Easy to understand instructions and simple pictures.
5,Memory upgrade the right way from the beginning,"Just like other reviews said, its very important for success/ failure of your purchase to educate yourself on your systems needs before trying to upgrade by your own.Dim's max capacity supported -256 mb, 512 mb, 1gb, 2gb-Dim's Max Speed supported -433 mhz, 533 mhz, 667 mhz, 800 mhz-Dim's Memory technology supported - DDR, DDR2, DDR3, etc-PC's max memory capacity -Mostly of systems 4gb-"
2,Radiance revisited after 2 years,"So, I have continued to listen to this CD again and again over the last couple of years... and it still leaves me cold. I know, why such a masochist... well, maybe the answer is that I really do like Jazz, just not this album.Obviously some people like it from the preponderance of the reviews. But I would guess that the vast majority of Jarrett/Koln concert lovers will NOT like this music anywhere near as much as most every other album he has created.If you love Art Monk, you will probably like it (I love Monk, yet DON'T like it). If you loved Jarrett's Melody at Night, you will probably not like this album much.At least this CD should come with a label: Caution, this music comes out of left field and is not suitable for the majority of listeners."
2,What Do We Mean By Mean?,"That old Monty Python line comes to mind when I listen to Radiance. I have been a Jarrett fan since the Koln days and had eagerly anticipated (and feared)this release. I put it away after one listen and then went back after several months. No change, unfortunately.In recent years Mr. Jarrett has taken to exploring the far fringes of diatonic, chromatic and every other ic of harmony. I'm not sure to what end but it seems more for self gratification than to offer his fans and jazz fans something a bit more palatible than Radiance. Being challenged by jazz music is worthwhile and listeners of Cecil Taylor and Andrew Hill can certainly feel rewarded by music that is both eclectic and appealing. But on Radiance, Jarrett finds combinations of silence and atonality that seem to speak only to him and the ""art critics"" who will forever praise everything he issues. And while I can't stomach the retro jazz genre in general, I wish that Keith Jarrett would get a bit nostalgic for Koln."
5,revealing,"this must surely be one of keith jarrett's most revealing and haunting releases ever. without being over presumptuous, on my part, this, to me, is a compelling honest read of his journal. each piece an extension of his pathos...jarrett's influence by post classical composers such as prokofiev, shostakovich and contemporary free jazz/third stream pianists such as paul bley and marilyn crispell shine brightly and in compelling fashion, with short lyrical and melancholic motifs dispersed throughout. it's been awhile since i've heard his playing and listening to this work is inspiring and daunting for pianists all over. jarrett is a pianist's pianist..."
4,"Great Product, Difficult Assmebly","Was going to build a miter saw stand myslef (per Norm's instructions) until I saw this one. Now that it's assembled, it works great. Makes life, in the shop, much easier. Putting it together was a bit of a chore, though. Especially when it came to the new bracing straps. Had a very hard time ""stretching"" one of the straps to fit it into place. I wish that the engineers, that designed this stand, had actually tried to put one together..."
3,I am a believer,"I think Mary K. Baxter's description is pretty good BUT my first concern is she is the 1st person in 2000 years to have had such a personal contact (over 30 in this book alone) why isn't the church more involved? this is big!!!! or not!Also she said that Jesus told her that he'd never leave her, BUT he did TWICE!I feel she also added her own prejudices too.I certainly believe in hell, I'm recently reborn but people like her ( and her prejudices) was one of the reasons I left in the 1st place THEN I figured out that I wasn't worshipping her or her kind BUT Jesus!"
1,NOT A DIVINE REVELATION AT ALL,"Anyone that is familiar with the character of God will know immediately that this book is in no way inspired by the Lord.The author paints a picture of a pitiful God that wishes He could do something about the situation of the lost, but is powerless to do so.Scripture is very clear that God is omnipotent and knows the beginning from the end. To insinuate that He created mankind knowing that this would be their lot, makes Him out to be a monster worse than anything the world has seen.A thorough study of the scriptures in their original language will prove that the punishment mentioned throughout the Bible is not ""eternal"" and it's end result will be in drawing ALL mankind back to the Father. ""IF I be lifted up, I will draw ALL men unto me"".This book, in my humble opinion, is a disgrace and portrays Satan as a successful foe to the Creator of mankind."
2,Baxter plays a childish prank by claiming Divine Revelation,"There are useful accounts of encounters with Christ that lead tovery uplifting and eye opening truths about our reality.I find it offensive that Baxter claims that this book is an account of Divine Revelation guided by the Lord Himself. Not the first time People have done this sort of thing.""Dante's Inferno"" as a fiction has more substance than this fibber. I catagorize this with the story-telling of alien abductees."
1,READ THE BOOK OF JOEL!,"I cannot believe the testimony of this book because of the fact that it misrepresents Scripture. For anyone who reads this book or who has read this book - check her references to the Book of Joel. Actually, check all of her Biblical references carefully. Joel is a short, quick read, so go ahead and read the whole thing. You will see that what Baxter has written in reference to Joel and what the Bible actually says are two very different things.I would consider this book dangerous, because it is fiction misrepresenting itself as Christian fact. I read this in an independent study of the spiritual realm of Christianity in an academic setting, so I would say that if you just want to see what's written on the subject for academic purposes only, then fine, it was a VERY interesting perspective. However, proceed to read this book only with extreme caution!"
4,Print faded,"Book material was as expected, however the quality of the printing was poor.several of the pages were faded to the point of being unreadable."
5,"Good read, great packaging","I purchased the book second-hand from seller :rjw1333She made sure that my packaging was perfect, even put a nice little note from her in the leaflet of the book.The book was a pretty good read, alhough I do have to question the way that she communicated to the people in hell. All of them seemed to say the exact same thing, even though they were supoosed to have different stories. I don't know, maybe it was just me. However I do recommend that everyone mature enough to handle the book read it. It really makes you evaluate everyday descions that you make."
1,Not very divine after all,"I remember reading this not long after it came out. I ate it up! It took me a few years to conclude that it was all her fertile imagination. I agree with another review posted here that asserts that the ""Jesus"" of Baxter's so-called ""revelation"" bears little to no resemblance to the Jesus of the Bible or traditional church teaching. I think this ""revelation"" can be safely ignored. As a telling side-note, has anyone else noticed her ""A Divine Revelation of..."" series of books? Looks like she started herself a franchise along the lines of ""Chicken Soup For The (fill in the blank) Soul""!! Sounds like money might be the big revelation here."
1,This book does not follow scripture,"After reading this book, I can only say that the author's heart was probably in the right place, but I am not sure where her mind was. I know hell is scary, I am a born-again christain, and read the Bible daily. I believe if she is trying to reach the unsaved, she went about it the wrong way. This book would only look like a bad horror novel to the non-believer. The entire book is not backed by scripture, and she is comparing herself and experiences to some Biblical people like John. The Bible is whole, and she is writing about visions and things never revealed to John in the book of Revelations. She writes that Jesus revealed secrets to her, but not to share these with the reader at this time. What is that? God is mysterious, but He provided us with all we need to know about receiving salvation. It's sad that this book may be all someone ever reads about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
1,Not quite up to the standard of her other books,"I have read most of Ms Small's books, starting from Skye O'Malley and the whole saga, Skye's legacy and the others too. ""Rosamund"" is more like a fanciful bit of English history book, where much of what is written there were mentioned in her other books too. Quite boring compared to her other books, and quite predictable. Now there's supposed to be two more of these? I can only hope them to be more spicy and saucy with an element of surprise."
5,A great album....,"A good friend introduced me to Dan Fogelberg's music by way of this album back in 1974 knowing that I was appreciative of good singer-songwriters, and this one hit the mark squarely. I went out and bought it and listened to it incessantly. I also took the time to learn several of the songs on guitar and I still play those songs to this day. Standouts for me include ""Stars"", ""More Than Ever"",""Anyway, I Love You"", ""Wysteria"", ""Hickory Grove"" and ""The River"". Along with the wonderful album ""Souvenirs"" I think this is Fogelberg at his best.Highly recommended."
3,"Should call it ""maybe""","Not as good as ""Cure for Pain"" but not bad either. A little dark - still glad I bought it!"
2,2 Morphine CD's NOT to buy - YES AND B'SIDES,"Its not a bad CD until you compare to their other work. It lazy, mentally and musically. When Sandman see's his self-respect crawling across the floor, his first thought is of this album."
2,There's a grammar error on the cover,"I find it hard to take seriously a book that has a grammar mistake on the cover of the book. Notice, if you will, the third bullet on the cover -- the one that says ""For anyone else who wants their written communications to be more powerful and professional."" Every grammar book I've ever read, including ""Bedford's Handbook for Writers,"" tells me that indefinite pronouns are singular. In other words, it should have read ""For anyone else who wants his written communications to be more powerful and professional."" If you don't like to use he because of political correctness, you can always say anyone else who wants his or her. Anyway, it doesn't make me very confident of the ability of a book to improve my grammar when the editor cant catch a simple mistake on the cover."
2,random!,"This movie is so random and awkward. The whole time I watched this movie I waited for the climax and it never happend. If you have nothing better to do then you should watch this, otherwise skip it."
5,Great purchase,"These are very sturdy chairs. They will work wonderfully for our family gatherings! The white granite is a great, neutral color."
1,Prepare to replace,"Horrible quality replaced 2 pumps, first after 2 yrs and second after 1 yr. Premium price, but certainly not a premium pump."
2,No longer being sold.,"I've had two of these pumps. The second one lasted just over a year and when I tried to replace it I was told they are no longer available due to bearing problems, etc. Beware when buying this pump."
1,Not reliable,I have owned two of these pumps and they both burned out. After doing some checking I find this is a common experience. I am going to try the Savio Water Master Pump and see if it is any better. Do your own checking but my research shows this pump to be a poor proformer and not reliable.
5,Suzanne is just plain queer funny,The CD was extremely funny. I have seen her live and the CD is almost like being there.
2,Not as good as the first 2!,"I was pretty disappointed when I got this new comedy CD by Suzanne, since I have her first two and love them! I laughed pretty hard listening to ""Nothing in my closet.."", and ""I'm not Cindy Brady"", but her 3rd one, ""Guaranteed Fresh"", I hardly even cracked a smile at. She's just not as crude and funny with this one - why the change Suzanne? What a disappointment..."
5,Get educated,Watch this movie if you have any concern for your future or that of your children. I taught me a thing or two.
2,TAP?,"Ok obviously the people who made this documentary do not live in Arizona.The tap water here is filled with fluoride, chlorine and other unnatural contaminants. If you fill a glass from the sink in AZ, you can SEE the density of the crap in the water. Yet the documentary completely ignores this concern.Now, I am in NO WAY defending the greedy, selfish water companies. This documentary exposes so many truths about bottled water, and YES I CAN taste the plastic in some bottles (In Arizona the plastic tends to melt a little into the water) making for a sickening beverage.What WE NEED is an alternative to both Bottled AND Tap."
4,worked great! but.....,"I used this product to re-wire my Harley and it worked great but I ran out fast. I'd recommend checking out your closest automotive store cause a lot of times they have precut pieces at about the same price and you don't have to pay for the shipping on a cheep item where the shipping is almost as much as what your buying, but live and learn I guess."
5,PERFECT!,"This is one of the best music scores ever,buy this CD because satisfaction is Guaranteed.I fell in love with the music of Bacharach after hearing this album in 92. It's jazzy and extremely sexy and you wont be dissapointed with the song the ""Look of Love'."
3,Teen Angst Half a Century Away,"This book shows that children in the 50's weren't as docile and obedient as your grandparents claim they were. Alice, the main character, constantly bickers with her mother, who has unwillingly dragged her to New Zealand(of all places!). In places, the book is sarcastic and funny, but I docked it major points for being rather boring in the beginning. Along with the normal problems of moving and being the new kid at school, Alice has to move into an intimidating old mansion with a lady that hates kids and an uncooperative, grumpy old man, and also discovers a mystery regarding her origins."
3,Item Pictured Does Not Match Item Shipped,The tee pictured shows an arm that can be moved to different hitting positions. The tee that was shipped has 3 post holes to move the tee arm itself.
5,"The Road Home, Riveting Masterpiece","The Road Home had me riveted. A Chinese movie that's the story of my life! I couldn't believe it.I'm a 70 year old widow who has been a weaver for many years. We held a memorial service for my college professor husband when he died; and to my amazement, just as the funeral in the film drew a multitude of mourners, past students of the dead teacher, every seat in the chapel was filled by friends who came from far and wide.A visually compelling experience.As a craftsman weaver, I can say that the film is absolutely authentic too. And including the repair made to the pottery dish."
5,Greatest Love Story on film,"I ordered this movie, thinking it was a horror film. I clicked on wrong icon. When it was delivered, I said- ""oh no, a 40 year love story- give me a break.""I did not watch it till a few days later. Luckily, I had nothing to do. I don't know where it started, but somewhere in the first 20 minutes, I found my eyes becoming misty.This has to be the most beautiful story of all time. I realized on my 3rd rerun of it that the couple do not even hug----never mind kiss.Zhang ziyi has come along way from this film, but I am sorry she no longer has roles such as these. I think she is a fine actress and seen her in almost everything, not realizing it was her. I am a big asian film fan-mostly horror buff. Occasionally, I wander but not too often. The Road Home is an exception.There are three scenes that have me fighting back the tears. I only watch it by myself. For obvious reasons---Enjoy!"
3,"Zhao Di, Yes Mao, No!","A visitor to China recently remarked that there was a traffic jam of bicycles in Peking when she visited 6 years ago, but today there is traffic jam of automobiles. After the disasters of Socialism and the murdering fraud, Mao, China finally allows economic freedom, and bingo, prosperity arrives. Chinese cinema is taking a recent look back at the disaster and forward to the future like a recovering cancer victim. The drama is in the past, the individual versus the iron boot of the Bureaucrats.Zhao Di is beautiful as the young girl in love with the new teacher. Since the villagers usually arrange marriages, this love affair, chaste as it is, is something new for the agrarians. Cruelly separated from her suitor by the State, Zhao must wait for years to unite with her husband. The theme: love overcomes all, or China becomes itself. You choose. The film is slow going, sentimental, and the plot is threadbare."
3,Good but just...,This was an o.k. read. I was expecting more. The last chapter about Israel and tips on visiting is gold. Buy used.
5,Best Rocky Horse on the market,This was a gift for my grandson. It is so detailed and cute. Looks real with the saddle and soft feel. The order arrived quickly and met all expectations.
3,Very cute but could be better made,"The doll is very cute and fluffy. Not quite 14 inches, maybe if you stretch it from toe to hair top. The quality is lacking as hair falls right away but for the price what can you expect these days. Made in China, as expected. Too bad there is nothing between made in China and Made in Germany at hundreds of dollars each. Wish there were toys in between priced and higher quality than these."
4,Like described,"Couldn't find a Zoe anywhere and when I found it online, the picture didn't do it justice. Several reviews said it was cuter than the picture so I ordered based on that. They were 100% correct, it's very cute and looks just like Zoe. It was a big hit with my little grandaughter."
4,mmm cookies,For some reason you can't find just a plain cookie monster in the store -- and my little girl loves him! Perfect size and really well made!
5,Soft & Cuddly,I've done my research and there is not a softer and cuddlier Big Bird out there. This is the quality that you expect from GUND. We have the whole collection. I highly recommend this product.
4,Great stuffed toy,The Gund stuffed toys seem to be better quality than many others. This one is really soft and cute and a good size.
3,unclear description on the ad,You could not tell from the photo if it had a moveable mouth so I was disapointed when I got it and you couldn't used it like a puppet. The doll itself is very nice but I would have liked to know it is not a puppet but a doll.
2,Not sure this is really a GUND,"Description says GUND but CookieMonster only has a label which says Sesame Street (not Gund).... Brand shoppers be wary! Also, bulk packed.... I am pleased to see that the eyeballs are plastic, white, and wrapped nicely in paper.... My 11th month old has less discerning tastes, thankfully."
1,SORRY,"It is costing us $5.00 to return Ernie, Grover and Elmo because the quality is below par.It would be better to charge $10 more and provide a reasonable quality product.This is just pathetic and would not recommend.Sesame and Gund can do better !"
3,Hard to find Bert,If your child is a Bert fan than you are probably happy just to find a Bert plush. Soft and cute and a good size for carrying around.
1,not so soft,"The t-shirts are very scrathcy and poor cotton. I expected some shrinkage, but wow they barely fit now. Length is way too short now. They are very thin as well."
2,Uneconomical,"No problems acquiring item. Cool enough for tropics and play their roll.However final conclusion ""...WAY TOO EXPENSIVE"""
3,Unfortunate formatting,"Probably shouldn't be to hard in judging a free book, BUT...As a retired English teacher, I find it difficult to enjoy poetry when the line breaks are removed. Other than that, at least the words are there..."
5,Dust hood,"The dust hood is exactly as described, but it is NOT the one shown in this picture. The JWP-13DH is the one shown in the Jet 13DX owner's manual. Amazon ought to update their photo because it seems like anything called a 'dust hood' has the same photo. It may confusing to shoppers. The JWP 13DH is a long-ish chute with the 4"" dust port oriented horizontally to the right if you are looking at the back of the machine. Like I said, I took a gamble and the right product showed up, even though the picture said otherwise."
2,2.5 karet,2 1/2Modestly powerful progressive can work as sonic wallpaper for the ambitious ex-metalhead but feels shallowly bloated under analysis.
2,Buy the Biesemeyer,"While I am going to keep and use this stop, I wish i has spent the extra $60 to get the much higher quality Biesemeyer stop. This model is many pieces held together with a few blots, all of which can easily become loose and throw off any accuracy. I would recommend this stop for work with a tolerance of +/- 1/16"". Or if you don't mind welding the 3 metal pieces together and gluing the plastic hairline cursor in place, this could be reliable and accurate. Surprise surprise, made in China"
1,Not a business biography.,"Unfortunately not a business biography but more of a London gossip column. Though the first part of the book regarding Mr. Fayed's entrepreneurial life is very interesting, after the first 100 pages it becomes very superficial, leaves out all details and provides no explanation at all on how Mr. Fayed has builded his business interests. Instead it focuses solely on his private life, repeats annoyingly the same issue (the true value and the obscure origin of Mr. Fayed's fortune without providing any insights)."
3,Read this book for a class,I read this book for a class. It provides an interesting perspective on the life of teenagers. The book fallows some students for a year in school. The author interviewed them for several years before writing this book. A Tribe Apart definitely gives you a different look at what life is like for a teenager. I would highly recommend reading this if you deal with adolescents it well help you get a better idea where they are coming from. After reading this book I bought a copy for every high school and junior high teacher that I know.I would have given the book a better rating but it is very slow and the writing style leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. Like I said the info in the book is great but it is not conveyed in that great of a way.
2,A Good Editor was Needed,"This book was required reading for one of my education classes and copious amounts of coffee were required to get through it. The author's intent was noble but the end result reads like a first draft,(a very long first draft)a sort of stream of consciousness, in an effort, I would assume, to be authentic and true to the youths' words. I had to keep rereading to figure out who was who. I found the writing very amateur and the profound realizations almost embarassing. These few kids are not an accurate crosssection of our youth society (as other reviewers have pointed out.) At least two of the kids has been physically abused and another has an acute psychiatric condition. I think it is irresponsible to call this journalism, and to present it as such. I probably would have been better reading as a novel. Also--Did anyone else wonder about the incredibly well-adjusted Chris with the perfect parents and the many details of his life only a mother would know??"
2,Totally Irrelevant,"Even assuming this is a good book with accurate information, it might as well be stored in a vault. I graduated in 1994, and I have a middle school child myself. The kids in the book are my generation, and I don't really need to read a book about that - lived it! Teenagers today are as dramatically different as we were to our Baby Boomer parents. They are tech savvy, and also the girls have been dressing ""sexy"" since they were toddlers, showing their stuff in front of the local ""Libby Lu's"". The In short, this book is a waste of time."
1,Just not the same,"Lynyrd Skynyrd is my favorite band, but this music just isnt the same. Most of the band has quit or died, including Ed King, Steve Gaines, Ronnie, Artimus, and most recently Leon Wilkeson, who died in the middle of the making of this CD. All this music is O.K, but it's just another band all together, and I think it that Johnny Van Zandt just doesnt have the same song writing abilities as his brother."
2,Sounds like Nickleback,There's only one Nickleback nu-Skynyrd.....stop trying to sound like them.Old Skynyrd was better obviously but even that was nothing groundbreaking.
2,Go Bananas instead!,"I just bought Lynyrd Skynyrd's latest album Vicious Cycle along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas (import) and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I`m not talking musical. I can't believe how boring Vicious Cycle is, the playing lacks spark and the songs simply aren't good or memorable. The arrangements are typical been there done that and Skynyrd just don't sound like their having fun! When the disc ended I knew I wouldn't be in a hurry to play it again any time soon.On the contrary, Deep Purple's new album is everything Skynyrd's isn't. Great songs, unbelievable performances and the band sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the running order of the album is just outstanding. I've played Bananas10 times as much as Skynyrd's latest.It's safe to say this is not Skynyrd's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple`s."
4,Still a great band,"Coming in somewhere between Rock and Blues, this is a very enjoyable listen from Lynyrd Skynyrd. It's true to say that they're not breaking any new radical ground and the formula is pretty familiar with a mix of heavy tunes and Rock ballads, also the latter part of the album starts to sound a little repetitive, but there aren't any out and out bad tunes here, and would you want Lynyrd Skynyrd to move away from what they do best.....me neither.Like the recent Charlie Daniels offering Lynyrd show a little bit of patriotism on a few of the songs most obviously ""Red, White and Blue"", but unlike Mr Daniels' rather unsavoury affair it's patriotic not jingoistic and ""Life Lessons"" even offers a fairly balanced view suggesting perhaps that maybe Mr Bush's administration isn't the arbiter of truth and justice that it perceives itelf to be (Well that's what it said to me anyway).All in all thoroughly enjoyable and very recommended."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent album - the best ""new"" line-up album, in my opinion. The Gimme Back My Bullets remake with Kid Rock is cool and an interesting take on the original. Well worth the money!"
3,this cd needs a little work,"I would give this CD 3 stars, It's not the best but I heard the group at the X Games and they sounded very good. I think that this group will get Big"
2,Atkinson's Depth Glossed-Over in At-A-Glance Bio,"While Dessau's book does cover the talented British comic's meteoric rise to success, the frantic pace and ""press-bio"" approach ultimately ruin what true fans await. Admirers of Atkinson's work will find themselves asking, ""and then what?"" on every page. We learn of his childhood surroundings, but very little of his family life. His impressive body of work is listed chronologically with no discussion of the blood, sweat and tears behind it. His classic influences are mentioned in passing, save his British similiarities to Stan Laurel. Left with very little insight into the creative process, Dessau's book reads like a coffee-table version of an Entertainment Weekly article with great photos."
5,"Great collection, wish it was in blu-ray","Great collection, I just wish there was a blu-ray version.I got this when it had a great sale price and definitely recommend it if you can get it that cheap as well.Some films however, like Lawrence of Arabia, have a newer remastered release already out that was not included in this box set. So just do your research on your favorite films in this box set to see if it is worth your buy."
5,Letter Game Review,"I purchased this game to use with my students. I teach reading and I have used these letter dice in a variety of ways. Students take turns rolling the dice and making words. With my older students, we follow the directions and make the crossword words. They all love it! This is a great game for all ages, too! My family played it recently at a holiday party and we all enjoyed the ease of the game. I would buy another one and use both cans together!"
4,Perfect size for baby book and baby keepsakes,"I ordered this on Amazon after seeing it for a similar price online at a popular baby store. If I had been able to find one I liked in the store, I probably would have bought it there since it would have been cheaper with a 20% off coupon. However, the convenience of Amazon Prime won out and I am satisfied with my purchase. I used it to display her baby book at her christening and have stored the book along with christening shoes, bib and hospital keepsakes in it. It has held up well so far (3 months of use). My only complaint is the picture and footprint windows are rather small."
4,beautiful memory box,"This is a beautiful box to keep baby's memories and items in. I love it. I just wish it had a few more pockets or drawers like the one I have for my other son, but this one is much prettier & is really all you need for storage of keepsakes for your child!!! Good purchase."
1,Keepsake box,"The box took a long time to arrive. When it arrived, it had black marks on the side and the top had been pushed in. I was very disappointed."
3,"does the trick, could be better","This tool does what it is advertised to do and that's about it. The tool's designers did create the perfect handle for the carrying case because the only comfortable way to hold it insures that the company logo is facing out. Very cleaver. However, in thier wisdom they decided to use a toggel switch for on and off rather than a paddle or deadman style. So if you drop it its a lot of fun. Secondly, it's not insulated or grounded and using this machine in a wet environment is problimatic. Make sure to set or remove any nails or screws in the work as they will trash the carbide blades. Setting and changing the blades is a snap and I highly recomend you buy extras! The side doors for dust extraction will go missing quickly but are easy to replace and inexpensive. Dust extraction is adaquate but I suggest a face shield and dust mask for protection. It is a little heavy and holding it over your head for extended periods can be tiring so pace yourself. Good luck!"
2,Get a Paint Shaver pro Instead!,This machine is really not designed to remove paint from claps or shingles. More or less designed to remove paint from a flat surface on sawhorses. I recommend you invest your money in Paint Shaver Pro. Useless product!
2,lean bien la publicacion,"buenas Compre Este producto Guiado Por Lo Que dice La publicacion Que son dos Piezas Cuando Me LLEGO LLEGO Una sola PIEZA deben de exigirle el venderdor que sea mas explicito en las publicaciones, es decir mas detallado por ejemplo en este articulo decir que es un cañon de 2 piezas pero que ellos estan vendiendo la pieza posterior. por otro lado el envio fue muy rapido y llego en perfecto estado gracias."
4,Just wish it was longer,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Gary McCord does an excellent job explaining numerous fundamental concepts. I wish it was longer, because I feel that McCord has a lot more to teach that isn't covered by the DVD"
3,Multiple rants of some of Bill's best material,"Rant in E-minor contains some of Bill Hicks' best material; however, it is not presented as a single performance. Bill's connection to audiences--especially American audiences--was hit and miss. And this CD gives you all of the hits. It's the situation comedy nature--like there's a laugh track--that turns me off to this CD. Bill's comedy was not about telling joke after joke. I like when the audience doesn't get it or doesn't laugh. Flying Saucer Tour, Vol.1 is a great example of an excellent comic ranting to a terrible crowd.Rant in E-minor, like Arizona Bay, has musical selections in between the bits. I like the idea of this, but I think the execution is still amateurish. Rant in E-minor has better sound mixing than Arizona Bay, but it still misses the mark.Because you won't hear some of this material elsewhere, I have to recommend the CD despite its drawbacks."
3,Hype not lived up to,This guy gets a lot of hype on the comedy circuts. Some of his stuff is very very funny and on the mark. Other stuff is just way out there weird. This album kind of feels like it was pasted together out of spare parts and is not one performance which I prefer.
4,Good fit,"Product was as described, fits well, if there is a flaw it is that it seems to be made of the same material as the original parts."
2,It's time for George to evolve,"I used to love to go see George when I would go to Shadow Lounge and The Mix in Miami 1998 -2000 - every other weekend. But, come on!! PLEASE develop your sound man.. Every one of his CD releases sound almost exactly the same. And the CD I bought of his with the red fingernails all over the cover had some of the worst quality recording I've ever heard on any CD. Terrible digitization and way lousy sound quality (by the way it wasn't just my CD - I read a lot of reviews about the audio problems with that release)I LOVE trance/Progressive House and I have a long-standing respect for George and his Miami roots, but its high-time that he brings us something new and fresh... and this album ISN'T it.If you want fresh Trance check out Anjunabeats / Above and Beyond. They have 5 volumes of some incredible Trance."
2,Nice customer service,"Great idea & very cute, as others have said, but ridiculously poor binding. I contacted the publisher, and they said they have fixed the binding problem and would replace mine for one with the new binding."
4,Another goodie...,"Wonderful and engrossing....although ""Cool Blue"" got on my nerves at times! Acording to what I've seen, the third book in the series was entitled ""Guideposts to Danger"", and only saw one printing...I would be extremely grateful if anyone could tell me where to get a copy...Thanks!"
2,Bad Audio On The Transfer,"This is not a great movie. ""Garden Of The Moon"" isn't trying to be a great movie. It does, though, feature two really nifty big band set-pieces, ""The Lady On The 2-cent Stamp"" and ""The Girlfriend Of The Whirling Dervish"". To me, that's worth the price Amazon is charging.BUT, the audio is terribly overmodulated. That means when Amazon did their on-demand transfer to DVD, whoever did the transfer turned the audio levels up way too high. The DVD I received sounds awful, like a continual explosion of static. That spoils this movie, which is all about music. The original film certainly didn't have this problem. That means Amazon, or their contractor, screwed up.I'll be returning this DVD and requesting a replacement. We'll see if Amazon can fix this. I hope so, because the music on this is a foot-stomping good time. If it's not spoiled by poor audio quality."
1,Don't bother if you're a beginner,"I purchased this video after reading several books suggesting knitting from the top down being the BEST way to make sweaters- as it allows for trying on during the knitting process. As a beginner, I decided to learn about it before the 5 piece way was set in my mind. This dvd was no help at all. Frankly, I was shocked Knitting Daily released this. Perhaos if I was a more experienced knitter, I may have been helped. This is definitely not an Elizabeth Z type demo dvd. You do not knit along with the presenter. She doesn't even knit the sweater for you to watch. The title should have been something like ""Knitting from the Top Down Suggestions/Hints"". To say it's a workshop is very misleading."
4,Style and Grace meet the Hand,"I have purchased one of the Hakuba pens (Silver) and I was quite pleased. Unlike many other pens of this nature this one never clogged, never quit working at a key moment...it continued until the end to roll the ink out onto the paper. These pens work especially great for labeling seasons' greeting cards and such and I have used them for school on invitations, I'm sure someone in need of an elegant pen would find a use for it in many, many other places. I recommend this pen to anyone who wants to create art and ballerina like elegance all in a letter written."
2,Review.,"Besides it's wonderful ballad -""If I ever fall in love again"", this CD has nothing to recommend it. The songs are pretty bland and peculiar. I was very disappointed.The Songs That Got Away"
5,Nov. 2011: $79.98 from Hip-Oselect.com.,"Yep, somehow the ""Sold Out"" status at Hip-O has changed, and they have these available again. I ordered & received one, so I can say for sure that it's legit.Get it while you can."
3,need 1/2 inch,looks hard to resharpen listing does not tell size of bits should have searched it.assumed it went up to half inch
5,King Memphis rocks!,This is a great new rockabilly CD. King Memphis are a lot of fun and have a great sound. Highly recommended!
2,Not a good choice for infrequent users.,"Epson's DuraBrite inks print beautifully, I have to admit, and the printer itself is quiet and fast. However, the reasonable price and colorfast pigment inks are offset by horrendous clogging problems and high usage for the (really not effective) print head cleaning cycles. I have seen numerous problem reports on this and other Epson series printers that use the DuraBrite inks (whether OEM or compatible doesn't seem to be the issue)- it is much harder to keep the nozzles clear on this than my old Stylus Color 740. Also, many people have had problems with the ink pump hoses detaching after the first cartridge replacement. Too bad, I really liked it when it worked."
1,This model is a lemon,I agree with the previous reviews. I never liked the way the paper fed into the printer but it gave quick sharp print jobs...until I had to replace the ink. After that it was all down hill. Thought it might be the ink so bought more. Nothing. Had a friend who works with and repairs printers look at it. After he tried everything he could he admitted defeat. THEN I looked up these reviews.....a lesson learned!
1,THE WORST PRINTER EVER!,"THE WORST PRINTER EVER!... and I don't say that lightly. It was nice until it became time to change the ink... then it printed out nothing but blurry lines, if that... no matter how many times I cleaned the print heads. I wish we could sue these people and get our money back.I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER EPSON PRODUCT IF I LIVE TO BE 100!To make matters worse.. their ""support line"" is a TOLL call, and after you wait 5-10 mins on hold, you're told that the call will cost you NINE DOLLARS!Hey Espon.. if you people read this, just know that any time a conversation on printers comes up, I will do everything in my power to stear people away from your product. Not only are your printers shoddy, but the fact that you won't provide free tech support for them says PLENTY about what kind of company Epson is.... GREEDY!"
1,Who writes these good reviews? Epson viral marketers. . .,"This printer is horrible, simply horrible. I bought it because of a rebate offer which made the stupid thing cheap. I'm still waiting for the rebate months later. Hello, Epson?That would be okay if the printer was good. But this printer sucks ink like I've never seen; the initial black cartridge lasted for about 15 pages, no kidding! The refills cost a FORTUNE, you have to change multiple colors, it is never aligned right, cheap ink doesn't work well, and it uses all the colors to print black/white (no idea why).DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRINTER! YOU WILL REGRET PURCHASING THIS PRINTER!"
1,Great printer for the first year,"I have the same experience as other reviewers. I was very happy wtih it for a year, but now it has stopped printing and no amount of self cleaning or ink cartridge changing has helped. Time to move on to HP or Canon."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I would have given 0 stars, just couldn't figure out how to do that. If you do a google search you will find that this printer will stop printing in black for no reason after a period of time. You will spend a fortune trying to replace cartridges to figure it out, but it will not work. After doing a search I found that this is a common problem. I will not be buying Epson printers again, as this is common in many of the models."
1,Worst Printer Ever,"We had 5 of these printers and 20 of it's predecessor the C82. Every single one has had the same problem. Eventually it stops printing certain colors. Head cleaning, new cartridges, and manually trying to clean the inside has left us with nothing but piles of junk that we now have to pay to have removed. WASTE OF MONEY! Stay away from the Stylus C series completely. Tech support no help. Everything surprising just off of warranty. Who would have thought..."
1,On the third and last C86,"I have been through three C86 printers under warrenty all having the same problem clogged head assembly. Cleaned, replaced and ran self tests until the cows did come home and the swell tech support of course stated the obvious "" Since it is not under warrenty I can reccomend a service site you can have it repaired at"" I said no I'm buying an HP after eight years of buying Epson. Quaility is gone with Epson and if you do buy this get the extended warrenty since you will be swapping it out every three months."
1,Good for a short time only before nozzles clog,"The Epson Stylus C82, C84, and C86 are good for a short time only, maybe one year tops when purchased new. Then, the nozzles clog, the printer becomes useless junk. Epson no longer will repair these old models.This creates a problem for those of us using older computers like my Apple imac OS 8.6, as there are no longer any printers available that work with these old computers."
1,Piece of Junk Printer,This price is WAY too much for this printer...I paid $200 brand new and it broke within 6 months. What a piece of junk.
1,Poor,"After the warranty was out, began to print badly. Took it to the shop for repair and was told one of the printing pens had to be replaced, cost $135.00 plus. Trashed this piece of junk, bought Canon printer. Best idea I ever had."
1,An hour and a half long brain fart,All the past writers and directors of the great classic horror movies should team up and sue this Roth character for plagerism. Roth just took select features from past movies and tried to stitch them together to create something original but instead produced a hideous mockery of the past greats in what proved to be an hour and half long cerebral equivlent of a really bad case of fatulence. Too bad there is no equivlent of Beano to help Roth with his recurrent ailment.
3,Barely 3,"Much of the Hype is because it is Quentin T. The film for the entire first half is just a soft porno. I went with a girl and she was not trying to see that stuff the entire time. After a while the pointless porn gets old. The movie also takes a while to get started. At times i found myseld getting board with the oh-so-predictable plot. Guys go to foreign country, guys break up, guys get lost, guys get killed. It is extremely gruesome. Most females, mainly the one I was with probably will not want to see all of that gruesomeness. Overall, the movie was okay. I will never watch it again. No scenes made me the slightest bit scared nor did anyone jump in the theater. Don't waste your time. I could have really done without this below average movie. You can too."
3,highly overrated,this moviez aiight. it haz alot of good gore. i thought it waz boring tho. probably one of tha most overrated movies of all time.
1,"Load of garbage, really bad movie....",This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. QT must be back to sniffing to much glue. This soft porn turns into a gore fest with no plot. What a let down this was. This is the only DVD I have ever paid for that I threw away after it was over. I should have used the 18 bucks for gas. Not even a renter. Please stay away from this load of cocci....PG. TCBRN.
4,Culture clash with chainsaws,"Sex-obsessed American youth culture collides with European intellectualism. Two American boys on a sexual holiday in Amsterdam run afoul of a ""hunting"" club that serves up human victims to jaded thrill seekers. The American survivor of the sadistic, bloody adventure learns with a vengeance and becomes the thing that nearly killed him. CAUTION: The unrated version of Hostel includes a great deal of nudity and extreme, graphic violence. Recommended for those who are looking for a really unusual film and can tolerate on-camera dismemberments."
2,what were they thinking?,Tarantino is a favorite filmmaker of mine. Eli Roth unfortunately is not. Yes Cabin Fever was entertaining but this film never really gets to the point. Porno flick disguised as horror movie.
2,Meh...,"I love horror movies and I love gore but for some reason this movie just doesn't do it for me. It was pretty dumb and not in the self-aware way that made campy classics such as Evil Dead and Dead Alive. Torture porn does not equal a good movie, there has to be something else going on to support it and in my opinion, this movie doesn't have it."
1,Waste of time from start to finish..I did not jump or squirm once,"Ok people said this movie was the scariest movie ever and I did not think it was scary at all I found Saw better and I did not really like Saw. Ok where to start there are so much bad things ok let me begging with the bad things.1.The first half hour was so pointless nothing happend.2.In the first hour theres just sex, more sex, more sex and yes more sex. Yes I can see sex in horoor movies but this was just pointless.3. The acting was beyond terriable4. There is no real plot to the movie5. The charactors are all stupid they all deserve to die. Now come on would you walk in an abanded factory NO and the main charactor dose are that stupid.6. It was not scary or grossOk now let me say the good things1. The one and only good thing was the last 20 min when things got interesting and the main charactor tries to escape.Over dont waste your time with this pointless trash moive."
4,HOSTEL,"I just loved this movie, it impressed me like no other movie had done it for a long time, thats why i bought the DVD, i just saw the featurettes and are great,and the movie looks great and sounds great.My only complaints are:-A lot of previews, but no Hostel trailers and TV clips, it would have been good to have them-No Spanish subtitles, i am from venezuela and speak english so thats no problem for me, but other people cant, and its weird because ive bought other region 1 Dvds and they have spanish subtitles.But overall a good DVD"
1,People Who Watch This Are SICK!!!,"What a disgusting Movie! Whoever made this movie and those that gave it a good rating should be on a National Psycho List. Unfortunately I bought Hostel 2 also, and it was just as bad. I love Horror movies, but this is not a horror, but a gross film."
1,Hostel,"...is a very sick and extremely violent film. It does get pretty rough towards the end. As soon as the 3 youngsters arrive in this retro slovakian ghost town, things turn ugly. The film itself does have a lot of asian, especially japanese, influence."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Oh sure, Hostel is horrifying enough, and some of its commentary on Americans in Europe is a bit interesting (notice who's the only person we see killing someone else on screen) but anyone with a couple million lying around can make something repulsive: a good horror movie relies on the director's craft rather than gore, and this one is all about the gore."
1,....roight,Gee...I paid $8 to see soft core porn.I feel so violated...anyways the horror scenes looked fake or were to dark to see. Very obvious movie and well.....preeeeeetty bad. Every person I know who watched it said..wow...that sucked. The idea behind it was good. But the actually script was well..lacking a movie concept. This movie isnt even worth the money to rent it as a new release. Either wait till it goes into the old movies bin or just dont waste your time(download it illegally or summin). Go see Saw 2...now that was GOOD!
1,Guys? The scarey image on the DVD box...,"...is a towel clamp. It's a surgical instrument used primarily for clipping sterile towels to one another when you're draping a prepped patient for an operation.Figure half a dozen of 'em in the average abdominal procedure tray sent up from central supply. The circulating nurse can always spill a couple more on the Mayo stand if you drop one on the floor, honest.Yeah, a towel clamp can be used as a tenaculum to grab soft tissue, sure. But that's because the pincer-like design enables you to bite into skin or muscle or fascia with *less* damage than a regular hemostat or Kocher clamp might impose by virtue of crush injury.They're actually a ""kinder, gentler"" way to grab the patient's flesh and hold it so that you can put the puzzle back together with a minimum of necrosis or scarring later.Sorry to kill the buzz."
4,torture is so sweet...,Great movie with one of the most disturbing scene I've ever seen...The first 30 minutes are just teenage-movie like which make me bored but after that just sit and suffer with the characters...
2,hostel,A little too much gore and violence for me. Definitely not something I'd have my children watch. If I could go back It's something I'd probably would've never bought. Thought of giving it away but didn't want my friends to watch this gore either.
3,It could've been better...,"I saw ""Hostel"" just the other day. It wasn't a bad movie, but at the same time, it felt like it was missing something. I'm not much of a horror fan, but I just didn't feel the horror so much. Alot of the ""torture"" scenes seemed to be highly edited till you didn't really see anything that was horrific. Also, if you're looking for a plot, ""Hostel"" isn't an award winner. It's not a horrible movie, but at the same time, ""Hostel"" lacked the gore or the plot that I was expecting."
1,Unbelievable (in a bad way),This Movie was pretty unrealistic. I can't imagin that the amount of people involved in the capturing of people to be tortured and killed in the movie would ever happen in real life. It seems the whole town is in on it. It might have been believeable to have just one or two people in on the capture and torture of tuorists but i can't believe that so many people would condone the killing if inocent human beings...especially the girl who just stands there and laughs as the final boy is captured. Completely unbelieveable. The movie made me laugh several times from this. Could have been an interesteing movie but the lack of character development and unbelievability made me loose interest. Not to mention the fact that the 3 boys are so annoying and such complete jerks that it makes u not even really care about bad things happening to them.
1,Two very sick movies,I reviewed Hostel one and two. Both are disgusting beyond description. Some people call them pornographic. They are sadistic and only show men and women of a mentally retarded stage far beyond most peoples imagination. Here is only shown the human trash of todays sick society.
4,Entertaining Thrill Ride,"Eli Roth has made an excellent 2nd film here and has now shown he will be in the game as long as he wants. A lot of movies try to copy the gruesome scenes from SAW and the violence of The Devil's Rejects. Some accomplish this in an entertaining way (Hostel) and some scare the [...] out of you (Wolf Creek).Hostel is not very believable at times. The characters and situations were a little too extreme to really believe. Still, the idea is so fascinating that people would want to kill for fun, that you just hang on for the ride.The concept of Hostel was based on true events and Roth has shown he can write an entertaining movie. The final half hour was so cool, that I have to believe Tarantino had an influence on how the movie wrapped up. You can see the movie go from all over the place to taking a very awesome ending."
3,"NOT MY BAG BUT, IT'S NOT A BAD FILM!","I have finally watched this notorious film! I must say it was nowhere near as gory as I was led to believe. There is an abundance of nudity in this film and mixed with this sort of gross out torture it really isn't my cup of tea. This movie is a thriller once it gets going and I found myself rooting for the ""good guy"" as he paid back some of these twisted F**KS! With all the really bad horror movies that come out, I can see why some would like this movie a lot. It is much better than most of the garbage they call horror these days. I am glad I watched it, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but, I don't think I need to see it again. Life is too short to get wrapped up in this sort of sick disgusting SH** on a regular basis.Happy Holidays Everyone! It's a great big wonderful world we live in!............Sheesh!;-b"
3,sympathy or empathy could help,"Luckily this movie was not as gory as I feared it would be, even this unrated version. I did like the growth of the main character Paxton though a lot of questions remained at the end about him. The overwhelming problem with this movie is that I just couldn't feel any empathy or sympathy for the three male characters the movie focuses on. The most sympathic one, Josh, is still difficult to feel much about because his history is vaguely discussed -- better than the other two whose histories are barely discussed. I couldn't understand the killers either -- no attempt was made to explain them beyond one or two scenes. Nameless and purposeless violence isn't scary to me so if the movie was meant to scare, it failed. If the movie's intent was to show how far some people will go to get a thrill, the lack histories for characters damaged it."
5,Perfect timing,"Donald Coxe does a great job of explaining how we got to where we are today. But the best thing is that he offers intelligent, witty insight into what investors should do next. At a time when most investing guides are offering bubblegum advice in a pop psychology wrapper, ths book is a breath of fresh air."
3,This may be the best book that you can find about HBT modeling in the world market.,"I met author of this book in Atlanta, Georgia at IMS2008. I ask him about 2 or 3 questions in this conference. I found that Dr. Matthias is answer my question very interestingly. But I am not sure this book talked about de-embedding or not. Eventhough, deembedding lost physical phenomena description in this device. But it is very important for circuit designer to use large signal or small signal equivalent circuit to design amplifier, filter and oscillator. etc. I confess that I have many book to read for fun but if I have research job I will spend more time on this book."
3,Save your money,"I got this unit and was not thrilled from the get go. It took alot of work to make it fit my Makita saw, much more than the adds claimed. Had to drill new holes,shim up the table to meet the saw table, and really mess with it,alot.The ""adjustable legs are just a friction screw, that looks like they may last a year.I am an contractor,who has worked in the trades for over 25 years.This isn't worth $200.00, not if you are working with your tools for a living."
2,Very few tattoos,"I didn't really know what to expect from the description ... This ""book"" contains just a couple of pages of mermaid tattoos."
2,"Long, boring and short on insights","I was really expecting something breakthrough given the buzz around this book, and was eager to dig in. Unfortunately, I found it to be page after page of uninteresting detail, with few ""aha's"" that I could apply in my work. I made it about halfway through and finally abandoned it."
3,Under their class,"A nice record, but they have made much better records. Check out for example House Tornado or University instead of this ."
4,The Avett Brothers,I download this album and have listened to it a few times now. I think it was onsale but well worth getting even if not.
4,Great album - It is the Avetts,"It isn't I and Love and You, but it is right up there. All the wistful transparency and full-on jumpin' up and down you would expect from the Avetts"
5,"Great Harmonies, Fun, Not Cynical","This band has tremendous energy on their uptempo tracks, and make me all misty eyed with their sad ballads. They keep tight harmonies throughout, and have excellent musicianship and lyrics. I haven't had this much fun discovering a new band since I was in high school. They can be knocked for being a bit sentimental, but the integrity of the performances transform what might otherwise be a bit cheesy into something sublime."
4,Heroes Of Legend,"This is an engaging story that is a study in colorful characterizations. The many characters are fascinating and multi-dimensional and yet the plot is not bogged down with a preponderance of detail. The author paints vivid pictures and evokes wonderful imagery with a minimum of words and creates a rollicking adventure yarn of epic proportions, all in less than 400 pages; rare in this genre awash with ponderous works. This is highly entertaining reading for any fantasy/adventure fan of post-""Harry Potter"" age."
2,I hate this book,I teach Spanish and the reason I hate this book is because it introducesconcepts and then gives little or no practice. The order in whichthings are introduced is a confusing at times. There is way too mucheye candy and not enough attention to working out the kinks.Other superior products are available at a much more reasonable price.
5,good service,"The book looks good, many pictures and explanations, with dictionary summary, which I love, no need to search for new words highlighted earlier."
5,Best book on process improvement I've ever read,"In my opinion, this is the best book on process improvement on the market today. It takes up where so many other books fear to tread and deals with practical issues of organizational dynamics. An excellent companion volume to the CMM, SPICE, or other technical framework."
5,"Biggest, baddest saw money can buy!!","I just finished a large timber framing project and this saw mad it soo much easier, you can cut thru any wood, the 7.5 is way more power than you will ever need, but i like it.the 18 inch blades are very hard to come by and pricy. I ran it with 230 on the job site but now it is in my shop on 460, not a hard conversion the hardest part is getting a electrican to rewire every thing (not many houses have 460 running to there house). This saw will cut thru any wood as if you just were pulling the arm,and for 7500 it isnt your average siding cutting, dado choping kindeling cutting radial arm saw."
3,Not What I Expected,"I do love many of Maxine Gadd's paintings, however the majority of my favorites are not included in this book. The image, ""Frost"" is included but what a poor reproduction it is in here. You'd be better off ordering a print or the greeting card if you want to revel in this image. I own the greeting card, and it is BEAUTIFUL. They way she paints that platinum hair is breathtaking. I was so disappointed to find my favorite image so poorly reproduced in her book. The image ""Frost"" appears faded and doesn't justify its beauty at all. Also, ""Emeron, Branwyn, Haegeth, Gingerbread House, Toadstool House"" to name a few loved works are left out.I found most of the images to be her more ""weird"" works. I regret to use this word, however for my taste and for others who adore my book list, I believe you will find this to be true.Look on Fatara World dot com and order your favorites instead. I hope one day she publishes another book with more of my favorites."
5,Beautiful,"This books is just beautiful. The graphics are sharp and clean, perfect for the art project I bought it for. But for children, this would be a wonderful picture book to introduce them to faeries and mermaids and such... Just lovely pictures and a good reference to the artwork of Maxine Gadd."
3,not instructional,kicheon is a korean internal martial art like chinese tai chi but at the same time very different in its methods it is an interesting dvd but dont expect to learn much
3,"Nice, but still room for improvement.","I wrote up a review at my blog (in quotes by my name), but I'll give it here with some tweaks.For the first few chapters I couldn't get past the downright *hokey* allusions... it's as if the author is so concerned that his readers ""get it,"" he makes the allegorical connections too obvious. Thus, I felt cheated as a reader. I like to work more for that sort of thing.But once I dropped the whole ""cocky editor"" schtick, I actually started enjoying the story. As Larry the Cucumber from VeggieTales once said, ""I laughed, I cried... it moved me, Bob.""If you can handle the Left Behind novels without too much eye-rolling, you will probably see this as our generation's Chronicles of Narnia, but all others: approach this book like you would a popcorn flick. In other words, don't expect much more than a fun ride, and you'll love it.So... I'd give three (out of five) stars. Cheesiness aside, it was alright."
4,Pretty good fantasy,"For a first in a series, and first book ever from an author, this is pretty good. It has some little flaws here and there, but overall, The Door Within delivers fun fantasy with a great message. If you're a fan of Brian Jacques' Redwall novels, try these, Wayne Thomas Batson has a similar writing style."
5,HOW CAN I GO WRONG!,"How can I go wrong, anything by the jacksons/Jackson 5 is classic music and of course good music . The only that can be said is this is some of the Jackson 5 and the Jacksons top hits, with Of course The one and only Michael Jackson on Lead vocal sexcellent CD."
4,FOR TUFF GUYS,"I received my table saw stand in a box that looked like it went through hell and back but I guess that is UPS's fault.Inside the box everything was great.The stand is very strong compared to other portable saw tables including older htc portable saw tables I have used.I mounted a 12inch dewalt sliding compound miter saw to it and it had more than enough room.Only thing I did not like about the stand was how the extension arms are to be set up.In the older htc tables after you set the main table up the extenstion arms would just fold out. In this new one you have to build it and set it up.It does take a little bit more time(1-2mins). but i have to say it is a lot more sturdier this way.In conclusion,this product is worth the money and trips to the chiropractor from lugging around a miter saw to every job site."
5,Something Special,I think this book is EXCELLENT! At the end of each chapter I couldn't stop reading. The characters were well described and the emotions were well thought out. This is the second Tamara Hayle mystery I read and I can't wait to read the others. I would also like to compliment the illustrator because the cover is what caught my attention to buy the book. I can easily say that this book is Something Special.
2,Grave's End should End,"Easy reading, but this book would have been much more believeable if the author wasn't so repetitious. She talked about the same things over and over again. I would have believed this story if the author wouldn't have stayed in the situation for so long and making excuses for staying in the house.I also found it hard to believe that she allowed herself and her family to endure such an unnerving lifestyle. Then again, if she couldn't stand up to her daughters (they insisted on living in that house) and her tenants (allowing them to stay for 1 1/2 years in her home while she remained in a cramped apartment) I could understand the personality. The book suggested that the author was a very weak personality and allowed herself to be used by her husband, daughters, tenants, and finally the entities that were in her home."
2,a definite letdown...,"i kept taking into consideration that this book was the author's 1st....and if the rest of them are like this one-i hope it's the last...some of the story was fine to read-what she saw, and experienced...but through out the whole book..she kept saying the same thing over and over,,sometimes-not even with different words...i found this book very boring...-easy to put down...and difficult to pick back up again!!"
4,Satisfied my need for a scare!,"This book was a page-turner and I thought it brought to light a lot of good experiences about ghosts/apparitions and poltergeists. However, I could not understand how this woman and family lived in the house for a very long time, 10 or more years I think, while continually being scared and terrorized. I thought it a little too naive that she waited that long before even looking into the possibility of a ghost/poltergeist or haunting. It was also repetitive at times and I found myself saying ""o.k. enough already - I get it, but I also want to hear more."""
1,I tried to like this book,"From the beginning, I believed that this was a true story. My problem is with the author, Elaine and how she handled this entire issue of living in a haunted house. She denied, she put her daughters in danger, she remained a skeptic til the end.Usually I can get into the story and allow it to be what it is. However, I found myself thinking to Elaine. What is your problem. Get some help. 10 years later, she finally acknowledges there is something wrong and seeks paranormal assistance.It's the kind of story that I found myself saying over and over again, ""I would not put that child in that room."" ""I would have done this so differently."" ""I would have given up my skepticism a long time ago and done something.""so ending this book was difficult because I voewed to finish it, and doing so made me resist picking up my Kindle. Next time if I feel this irritated, I'll just stop reading it."
3,Interesting and a fast read,"I've been fascinated with the supernatural, and picked up this book to read. I enjoyed reading it, but I cannot imagine living with the ghostly happenings for over 10 years without doing something about it! However, I don't live in house with that much paranormal activity and maybe it's just something you get used to!"
5,Enjoyed the book,I liked the writing style. It seemed a very plausible story. Almost she has made me a believer. I would recommend this book.
2,OK for an amateur writer,"After reading this book, I realize you can't trust Amazon.com reviewers all of the time! The author isn't a writer and saysso. But she should have had a professional editor. The book has some creepy moments, but they are isolated. There is no sustained suspense. Unless you are familiar with Brooklyn, you don't even know that she lives in the Gravesend neighborhood until you are two-thirds of the way into the book."
1,A book to share,Grave's End: A True Ghost Story was a riveting tale. It speaks of true to life experiences with something that is not what is thought of as common occurrence and have no idea as to the cause of the happenings. It shows how easy it would be to wonder about one's mental health. A great read for all who like ghost stories and also a training reference if you are into paranormal pursuits.
3,Its a good book......,"its a good book to read about a true haunting that wont scare you that much, compared to some other books that are out now a days its a little boring."
1,Nothing like I expected!,"I have to say that I was very unimpressed with this book. First of all, what kind of mother allows some unseen force to terrorize her children for 12 years before she attempts to do anything about it? I felt nothing but sadness for all the horror and problems that this family went through. How terrible it must have been. However, I felt nothing but anger with every page that I turned in this book. I waited and waited for her to do something about it. Well she did......12 years later. I'm sorry but that is completely ridiculous!!!! And even afterwards, she doubted the origin of the happenings. When will people realize that ghost exist? We all need to believe what we see with our own eyes and not what our faith tells us!!! SEEING IS BELIEVING!!!"
3,Plan Toy Solid Wood Drum,"I was a little disappointed. The reviews were very good, so I thought it would be great for my 14 month old granddaughter to hear the different sounds. There is hardly any sound differences and it mostly all just sounds the same. It is very sturdy and maybe some day she will enjoy it, but I am not sure what age would enjoy this toy. It seems pretty boring for all ages. Her favorite part was chewing on the drum stick!"
4,WYSIWYG ~ Good for autistic young kid,"Sturdy, good sounding, & great for my autistic kid. Produces sounds that she likes & can engage her independently for 5-10 min. Good autistic kid toy. My ratings are based from an autistic kids point of view"
3,Short but well done,"This soundtrack to the 1991 Robert DeNiro film doesn't have that much to it, but what it has is pretty good. The first half is all classic jazz standards like ""I'm Just a Lucky So and So"" by Louis Armstrong and ""It Never Entered My Mind"" by George Shearing. The second half is a fine score by James Newton Howard. This will be fine addition for soundtrack collectors."
4,Very Good!,"Although Mario's second album is not perfect, it definately has its share of wonderful songs where his vocals light up the track. I like his mix of slow songs plus the fast, party songs on the cd.MY FAVORITE SONGS1. Boom Feat. Juvenile2. Let Me Love You3. Let Me Love You Remix Feat. Jadakiss"
4,Turning Point is most def on POINT,"Mario's last album was nice and catchy but very young at best. On Turning Point Mario takes the more grown up approach with not only his songs but his image. When ""Let me love you"" hit I couldn't believe how much range he had in his voice. When the album came I quickly got it. It's very unfortunate that Usher had the year he had because Mario is gonna be put in the ""Trying to be like usher"" list. This album has many high points such as ""Let me love you"" ""Couldn't say no"" ""Call The Cops"" ""Nikes fresh out the box"" and the rock filled ""Here we go again"". Mario is only 18 as he states and if he keeps improving his music like he did with this album there really won't be any more ""like usher"" talk."
3,A'ight,"Don't get me wrong, the young man can sing...but there's something missing in this album. He has a harder edged feel and all the beats on this album sounded Old School 80's. I was so confused by the beats, especially when he was snapping or cursing. It seemed out of place. The Nike song is a ""Next"" for me. I would never listen to that more than once. Famous people doing the advertising thing gets old quickly (yeah, Busta and Nelly got the ""Next"" button too. I liked it better when Petey Pablo just added his advertising as a quip at the end. Dedicating a whole song to a shoe is kinda lame).Anyway, the old school feel took me back to grammar school, but it didn't make me enjoy it anymore or less. I would really like to see him produce his own album. I get the feeling his beats would be much better and they would fit his style. His words worked, but they didn't match the music. It seemed like somebody had to talk him into doing every song...but I could be wrong."
4,i like it!,"alriite, im in love with this CD right now! im feelin the beats and the lyrics & as a plus, mario is sexyyy. hahaa. anyways, i really liked his previous songs (just a friend, cmon) and i loveddd Let Me Love You when it came out (now i'm quite bored of it). this cd is great though! some of the best songs are:- 18- Call The Cops- Here I Go Again- Let Me Love You + the remix- Couldn't Say No- Girl I Need- +Boom has a great beat"
3,Wrong Mario (guy up top),"I can see you're confused! You've got the wrong Mario. You're looking for Mario Winans (A.K.A) the winer. You're right though, all he does is complain. He might as well do a Cd complaining to God about Satan."
4,Best promotion for wrestling...could have showcased better matches.,"This DVD is great, it doesn't have the best examples of why ROH is the best promotion wrestling wise in America. There are some top quality matches. Out of 8 about 3 would get the nod as worthy of showing ROH in the best light. The Kenta vs Aries match is a 5 star all the way around. Matt Sydal (Evon Bourne) vs Delirious would have fit perfectly here and the comedy Foley match could have been a bonus feature but not worthy of the disk. Its still a buy for wrestling's core fans. If you like John Cena stay over with the WWE's crappy DVD's. This is for serious wrestling fans who care."
5,A message from a Spice Girls fan that also likes KoRn,"I think this is a amazing cd! Its like the best songs from the album ""Spice"". I was an Anti-Spice Girl guy, but this cd made me change my mind. So, to all the spice girls haters, buy this cd becuz it will change your attitude twords the spice girls!"
1,"Desperately dull, and nothing like the original songs.......","It's unfair of me to review music by a group I have a very low opinion of in the first place, but I managed to get a 'white label' copy of this CD single to play at the club where I work as a DJ. That wasn't up to much, and neither is this 'official' release. This medley/megamix focuses on the Spice Girls' main hits, but recorded in 'club' style which is the first negative point of many. This new style makes the once familiar songs almost unrecognisable, and you're left wondering if these really are Spice Girls' songs. The mixing is okay, I guess, but nothing special to praise. You'll enjoy this CD single if you collect weird, alternative mixes of well-known songs. But don't buy it thinking it's a bona-fide Spice Girls release.Jon."
5,Great illustrations!,"Bought this to read to my grand-daughters. The illustrations are amazing, with the trolls creepy hair and nasty yellow teeth! A great classic on why NOT to be a bully like the troll. He lost in the end."
1,Reinforced Plastic,"Storehorse 10115-6 is nothing more than the original storehorse. The description is misleading, I didn't see how the plastic was reinforced with any fiberglass. Also, it does not tell you that you are buying a pair, so don't order 2 like I did, or you will get 2 pair.Added Later: I see they updated the title to include (1pair)"
1,What?,"For some reason this movie popped into my head today. I remember seeing it at the theater in 1992. It was a terrible movie, just terrible. It wasn't my idea to see this movie. Another person selected it. Bad mistake. A forgettable movie that's about..........I don't even remember. It was that bad.One star."
3,Very Good Taste,The taste is very good. I found a distinct taste in my cooking. I tried with `Coarse Salt Trapani Vincenzo'. That was good but it could not give me the perfect taste. This SayulitaSayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSaltis the successful one which helps me to bring my desired taste. It is also rich is nutritious value. I love it!
4,"""HOLE IN THE SKY"" review by Jose Paredes","""Hole in the sky"", written by Pete Hautman is one of the greatest books I've ever read. The book tells about fours teens that try to survive in the wake of a deadly flu virus that has destroyed most of the earth population by 2028. A group of people immune to the disease see themselves as ""the chosen"" and threatens to use the virus to wipe out all other survivors. Ceej and his friend Tim set out to rescue Ceej's sister from the cult, though they aren't sure if she's a prisoner or a willing participant. They meet a girl who is convicend that there is is a magical path out their diseased world and into another one. Each of the four teens narrates of a portion of the story. The Grand Canyon works both as great place appropiate for a disease, and as a hopeful site for a mistical transformation into a new uncontaminate planet. In conclusion I recommend this book especially if you like futuritis fiction and survival stories."
4,Wow! 21 songs!,"nice overview of a seriously overlooked band. Would have liked to have had the songs YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A WHORE, HEARTSPARK DOLLARSIGN, SHORT BLOND HAIR and their great cover of the Go-Go's OUR LIPS ARE SEALED instead of a few that are on here, but all in all a nice compilation. Hope Art gets a couple good guys to carry on Everclear since Craig & Greg are apparantly done."
2,Not very interesting,"Even Mould himself, in the interview that appears on the bonus disc accompanying The Last Dog And Pony Show, admits that this album is a little stiff. And indeed, it is. But I'm not sure I would have liked whiny tracks like ""Art Crisis"" or ""I Hate Alternative Rock"" even if the arrangements had been more limber.""Egoverride"" is a pretty good single, and ""Deep Karma Canyon"" hums along nicely. Plus, the cover art is pretty nifty. But it's by no means an essential part of Mould's oeuvre."
3,"Great cups, but these are not the glow in the dark version","I've had a great time with these cups and love seeing friends get addicted to trying to beat their own times and other friends times. The cups are great, the pad keeps the cups from sliding too much and muffles the sound when playing with them, the timer works great and really makes tracking your improvement a lot of fun.The cups though are not glow in the dark and the timer's battery was dead when it arrived but a spare one came with the pack. I also bought the green version of these cups and those ones are actually the glow in the dark version.Speed Stacks Glow-in-the-Dark StackPack Green"
1,Disappointed--save your money,"I ordered this book because it was about the only book specifically devoted to Cabo. I was very disappointed. I carried the book to Cabo and back but didn't really use it. If you strip away the generic ""travel"" information and the history information, this book contains little that is useful. The restaurant reviews are good, but not all restaurants are covered. The reviewers below had more valuable suggestions than this book, such as -- don't rely on credit cards, bring cash, small bills.The book is woefully out of date. It doesn't even contain a decent map!"
1,Terrible product,This product died on me 2 months after I purchased it. I called tech support 3 times in which I waited up to 55 minutes then gave up. I called customer service and got an answering machine. No one ever called back.
2,Beautiful pictures but horrible for information,I got this book and I was suprized to find out that it had very little information whatsoever as to how his tanks were set up and the techniques he uses. I would not recommend this book for anything other then something nice to look at and wish that you hand the time to put into making your own tanks look like that.
4,An excellent teacher resource,"The original documents pertaining to Shakeseare's life and works is an excellent teacher resource. The text of his will, excerpts of newspaper accounts that sparked The Tempest and the DeWitt drawing of the Globe made our studies of Shakesperae more concrete.As a loyal fan of Shakespeare, I enjoyed the reading. I think the text is a little dry for most."
4,Guns of The Civil War,"I liked this movie "" Guns of The Civil War "" because it furnished me with some facts about armament Of the armies that I seemed to have overlooked or forgotten about. I also liked it because of the photography showing the details of the weaponry involved. My favorites were the Henry and Spencer Rifles. These two weapons I feel, helped usher in the era of modern war fare along with the Gatling gun."
4,Different Sound,I bought this item as a gift for my wife. It is nicely made. It has an unusual sound. It sounds like a bubbling brook outside on our patio. Some may not like this sound but it is a refreshing change from the tinkling sound that most wind chimes make.
3,Decent product for the money.,I received this work table a couple weeks back to tackle some household projects that have been hanging over my head. Shipping was quick and packaging was fine. Directions were a little sketchy on some of the parts...directions show them as loose parts but they're already installed on the table...so I was looking around for them and I didn't need to.Only used it a couple times but it seems fine. The cranks to open and close the table top are a little flimsy...maybe they'll break in but they are very light weight and it takes two hands to get things moving. I'll update my review once I've had a chance to use it more.
4,"Good, but lightwieght","Not quite as rugged as Workmates of yor.But when gotten on sale well worth the price.I bought two, one goes on loan, one stays at home."
1,"Cheap, Cheap and Cheaper","Cheap, flimsy Chinese junk. Won't last a week under normal use. How do I know?? I've owned one of the original Workmates for 30 years. Returned the flimsy junk and will rebuild the original for another 30 years of reliable use."
2,just ok,I expected more with this table.... assembly instructions are not too clear and the final result is just ok....
4,Good product-terrible instructions,"I have owned a couple of these units in the year since they first came along. They are handy. They will make some jobs much easier. They are useful for the week-end warrior and the professional. Just bought this newest iteration of the Workmate. When you get ready to assemble it be sure to bring a lunch!! I even had to call B&D; Support, which gave me INCORRECT information. Finally figured it out but DO NOT count on the assembly instructions being much help and remember, I have DONE it before!!I've read complaints about the new top material. Do not complain about it being bamboo. Bamboo is far stronger, harder and more resilient than the previous MDF top material.In summary: the same sturdy, useful product with some nice upgrades but an atrocious assembly/instruction booklet.I would recommend it any day."
3,Half Over-Heavy/Half Over-Flimsy,"This product is a great idea with slightly flawed execution. It is, as others have noted, pretty heavy for its size. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.My bigger concern is that the vise cranks seem flimsy. Yes, the vise grips as advertised, but every time I turn the cranks I worry the thing's going to fall apart on me. So far no major problems, but not quite as solid a tool as I'd expected."
3,Pretty good tool; AWFUL instructions,"Recently purchased one of these hoping to use for several simple home projects, (and regrip my golf clubs too)Despite all the warnings to the contrary, ordered it from Amazon and yes, it did arrive with some minor damageThe illiterate, unintelligible ""assembly instructions"" were a challenge - not only for me but also for B&D; phone support - who had to keep me on hold for 10 minutes while they clarified the 2nd and 3rd instructionsFor instance - the ""jaws"" (the three boards that comprise the top of the workbench) are attached to the bench frame by an unusual mechanism, that is only vaguely referenced in the instructionsOnce past that, it seems to be very versatile and easy to use - but don't hope for any instructions from B&D; - trial and error will serve you better"
3,Necessary Evil,"Portable workbenches are a given for most guys but this one is not the best around. The one-handed clutch broke after 2 months, as did the handle turn for both sides. It is just a cheap piece that cannot bear much wear, but it is necessary for work space. Continue the quest, or pay the bucks. Two to three stars"
4,Good for its purposes,"It's built fairly decently. It's not like the one I had from 15 years ago which feels sturdier than this one. However, I bought this for my son and it does well for him. It serves his purpose of cutting various pieces of wood, holding objects in place as he works on them, and the adjustability is a great feature because he is able to clamp down various sizes of wood. The folding feature of the table is excellent because it has a small footprint when everything is folded in. I'd recommend it in general. But if you are looking for a true workhorse of a bench, this may not be the best out there for you."
4,Black and Decker Workmate 425 - strike 1,"Recently purchased workmate for a very good price when it was suddenly on sale at a discounted price. Which is good because it made it easier to accept that parts of the workmate is cheaply made. There is a cheap plastic band that is supposed to enable the vice to be tightened by turning one handle. The cheap band might have worked if it had not been assembled incorrectly which caused it to hang up and break. The workmate will still work but you have to tighten both handles, which is why I still gave it 4 stars."
3,Too Gadgety,"I had one of the original workmates in my wood shop (I am a professional sign carver) for 20 years. When it finally gave up the ghost, I replaced it with this model. Is @ as sturdy as the old model, but too many parts, etc... I also don't know yet if I will like the dual handle clamping system - my gut feeling is it will break. I'll keep it, but will buy another 225 model."
1,very flimsy product,I just got mine and this product has nothing to do with product descriptions. It is flimsy has alignment problems and crank is a joke really. And instructions are ridiculous. I will send mine back. Do not bother buying this thing unless you will use it once in a year.
5,Nice cable,Got this cable to connect my cable box with my mac mini. The cable works fine as per the specifications.
3,Unable to use,If you use this extender the flow back valve is too far away to prevent flow back. So I don't use it.
5,Working Overseas,"192 pages of ""know-how"" from a veteran overseas employer. Hundreds of current company names and addresses. Historical information and maps. Addresses many topics such as why work in the Middle East, using the tax laws to your advantage, living and working in the Middle East and an intensive look at the countries in the Middle East."
2,Still waiting,"I ordered this outfeed table on July 1 when I placed my order for the Rousseau 2775 table saw stand. I got the stand quickly. Amazon has been very good about keeping me informed of the status of the order. However, it has now been over a month since I placed the order. Either Rousseau has one heck of a back log on orders for this outfeed table, or they don't care that much. Ill wait, because I think it is a good purchase. Hey Rousseau....Wake up."
5,Pure poetry!,"My son and I loved this book! We read it so much we wore it out. The story of a Puerto Rican tree frog, a ""coqui"" who travels to New York City, it is pure poetry from start to finish. My son is now 13 and feels he has outgrown the story but I still read it from time to time. The illustrations by Brad Teare are totally charming."
5,good product for a good price,I received the batteries on time and the performance is good. I would recommend this to any friend.
2,Too fluffy - didn't finish,"Also, an avid time traveller reader. I also could not buy into either of the main characters. Sorry - they would not be that accepting of bouncing to the past or beleiving in someone popping in from the future. I started reading - got 100 pages in and pretty much said - I don't have time for a romance novel. If you want a book with time travel and some romance - - try The Mirror by Marlys Millisher. My all time favorite book that I probably have read every year since it came out almost 30 years ago."
4,REALLY CUTE...but...,these shoes are super cute!!!But the first times you wear them they can be extremely painful. The shoes take two or times wears to break in...during those times you wear them be prepared to go through some pain and back foot rub. The back of my feet peeled off (right where the shoe starts) because of all the rubbing that it did. When they finally stretched out they became one of my favorite shoes! i love the crinkly worn out appearance and hearts. The pink hearts in the white shoe are not as light as they seem in the picture; they are actually fuscia.
1,Ugly,What was I thinking?? I am too old for shoes with hearts on them!! The leather is very rigid and crackled-they look defective. They do not move with the foot because they are so stiff. They were returned. They seemed to run a half size large.
2,The bit is okay but the vendor is worthless,The bit is fine but the vendor is worthless. The first shipment was lost and I had to wait a long time before Amazon would admit it and send another.
1,Nothing Revealed,"A first, I was drawn by the Dungens & Dragons type of cover design. I thought that this would be an easy to read guide that a novice might understand. Well I was wrong! This book goes over the reader's head and doesn't explain this technology in a concise manner. It lacks the tables and charts that help visualize the material that is hard to grasp at first. Hence, I would recomend Muller's Blutooth Demystified as a better starting point for those actually interesed in learning all about Bluetooth."
2,"Who found the original screen play from ""Office Space"" and dragged it out of the trash",Same old cliche office jokes. Why wasn't I surprised when a man on the toilet scene was the centerpiece of the humor?
1,dead batteries after a year,I bought the 18 volt combo kit and i had three batteries with it and after a year all thee batteries have died.I have the same thing in a makita and the batteries are over two years old and none have died.I bought another set of batteries for the milwaukee and those batteries are dying.I will never buy another milwukee product with batteries.I'll stick to makita.Milwaukee 18 volt batteries are the worst!!
1,milwakee vs makita,"i got suckered in with the 18volt old milwakee some how , we as mobilehome techs for many many years had mikikta cordless tools , literally fell from the roof tops and still kept on working . old milwakee batterys stink , ihave all the tools saws ,saws alls drills and flash lights ,batterys just plain suk . got sukered you dont .go with makita"
1,Milwaukee Battery life,On my 3rd set of batteries and when i looked inside the case it has the same cells as the cheap batteries just a different case.
5,Milwaukee 18 volt batteries,"Could not find them this cheap on e-bay plus I got free shipping on two heavy batteries.Very happy,I will be back!"
4,Milwaukee 18 volt battery,Works good but as with all Ni-Cad batteries they are too expensive for what you get.
4,All Batteries wear out,"After reading these reviews, maybe I should knock on wood but I have owned Milwaukee cordless drills (2 of them) for about 6 years now. I use them all the time but not daily. The last time I bought batteries was 12/03 (I write the date on them with a sharpie when I get them) and their performance has been great. I am now purchasing two more batteries and I expect them to perform as the previous ones have, if they don't I guess I'll come back and give another review."
4,"Good batteries, pricey anywhere else","These are great batteries, mine have gotten a lot of use and they lasted about 3 years. When I went to replace them I couldn't believe the cost. $80 for one battery at a major national chain home center. It almost made me buy a new drill. Then I found these on amazon. Two batteries for the price of one! It's hard to beat deal like that!"
3,Revive and extend the life of these batteries,"No doubt these batteries need a little more TLC then most, but the trick to keeping them running is as follows: First, keep `em charged- leave them on the charger at all times when not in use; they safely trickle charge once the primary recharge is complete. Second, switch the mounting from time to time (i.e. forward insert vs. rearward); what the heck this does electronically I don't know but it sure has worked on all my Milwaukee 18V batteries to reverse the effects of rapid draining. Lastly, when they won't charge at all, jump them using lower voltage source batteries to obtain the minimum threshold needed for a full recharge."
2,Battery Life,Im a Contractor and havent had very good luck with Makita or MIlwaukee 18v batteries.I dont know if they sit on the shelf so long there is not much life left when purchased or they just dont last very long .Maybe they should offer new batteries sent when purchased . Kind of disapointing when spending hundreds of dollars on quality tools .
3,shipping kills the deal,"I finally spent the money for a set of sturdy well built Trojen saw horses, and I thought 50.00 each was pricey but worth it in the long run. Then to my suprise I was nailed with two seperate packages billing at 10.00 each. to ship. boy Amazon has got a shipping scam going. This was before the hurricane. find somewhere else to get them."
5,THE BEST BOOK,"Nobody ever takes teenagers seriously, especially when it comes to love. Thanks to the author for not only taking ""teen love"" SERIOUSLY BUT GIVING US GOOD ADVICE ALSO. i LOVED THE STORIES. There was one that I felt like I could have written it myself and that is the other thing I like about this book. Almost everything in it is something that I have gone through or at least could understand. They have guy's questions and feelings in there too which I really enjoyed. I always wondered what guys were thinking and if they cared."
2,Cannot Compare with Chicken Soup,Teen Love on Relationships cannot even begin to compare with the Chicken Soup books. There were too many questions and not enough stories. And the questions that were asked are not usual questions that older teens would ask. Stick to the chicken soup!
2,"cute, but scent a bit odd","the smell is not what i would expect from the name. it's a little more ""soapy"" and less ""fruity"" than i would like. the soap also didn't fizz and only added marginal bubbliness to the bath. kind of a disappointment."
2,Pretty but...,"Beautiful case! Well made...but, when you grab the case to put it in your pocket, it pushes on the power button and drains the batteries...not good. Sometimes just zipping the case (if you have 2 or more business cards in the case)pushes the power button and drains the battery. It's sweet looking but it does not protect well."
3,WHY isn't this DVD offered in the U.S.A.?? It's on in the U.S.!,"First off, the SHOW is AWESOME! It's great! I happened to see previews for it before the first season came out and I ended up watching it faithfully. If you have not seen it - it's a must see - somehow! Season 2 is in the making. Second, I'm not understanding WHY the first season is not offered in the United States on DVD??? - the show is on DirecTV (and cable). This doesn't make sense! H E L L O people we're not back in the 60s or 70s - let's get with it and put the show on DVD for ALL TO BUY! THANK YOU! I hope ""Being Erica"" fans agree! This is ridiculous!"
2,Good tunes...but 16 minutes?,"Let's be honest - nine bucks for 16 minutes of music is somewhat steep, even if the songs are really, really good.And they aren't, at least not spectacular or amazing. The CD is decent and entertaining, like most of Hybrid's stuff: not brillant but stands out in the crowd. The tracks are definitely worth listening to, and make me look forward to what Hybrid has up its sleeve for the next album.In the meantime, you're better off just downloading the two songs off the net. Normally, I don't do this because: one, techno and trance albums are often well-mixed, and you can't duplicate the fine track transition quality of a commercially produced CD; two, I like to give music groups I like money; three, I'm a lazy son of a gun who doesn't want to download MP3s all day to save a small fortune. However, I draw the line at some point. Downloading two tracks (and they aren't mixed, so don't worry) won't exhaust your mouse hand.It's good music. Get it for free."
5,Olive Season,Carol Drinkwater provides so much information and knowledge about her Olive Farm. Delightful Memoirs of her life. Excellent.
1,"Well researched, but poorly executed.","I found that by halfway through, I had to send Mr. Cropsy an email. After finding countless spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes, I emailed him with a single page that had 6 misspelled or incorrectly used words (including, throughout the book, ""there"" used when he meant the possessive ""their"") on it and asked if he was aware (assuming he was due a credit or a republishing because of the heinous mistakes on nearly every page).He admitted that he didn't have it proofread before sending off to print. It's a shame that the text such an attractive hardcover book, written from an interesting perspective wasn't worth handing off to someone for two to three hours of proofreading; that the legacy of all his research reflects the complacent, declining literacy standards of the current millennium. Photos and research: A. Execution and readability: D."
4,"Lights, Camera, ACTION!!!","Did you ever think that a good book would start with two identical Honda Civics? I know one that does! Read Janette Rallison's book Fame, Glory, and Other Things on My To-Do List to find out how. It is about a talented, young actress named Jessica. At her school, they are putting on a version of Romeo and Juliet and she is determined to get the lead. When Jessica realizes that a new boy at her school is really the son of the famous actor Christopher Hunter, she gets very excited and comes up with a plan to meet him. This book is an exciting page turner! Pick it up and you won't be able to put it down! So join Jessica, and the rest of the club! Lights, cameras, ACTION!"
2,Carry bed is cute but not easy to use.,"I got this for my 18-month old granddaughter, to go with the Corolle 12"" doll we gave her for Christmas. She loved the doll, but was frustrated with the bed because the cover does not come all the way open (imagine a huge slipper), so the doll has to be slid into the bed under the cover, and that was too hard for her to accomplish. I hope she will use the bed as she gets older and more adept at sliding the doll under the top cover, but for now I don't think she'll play with it. She did have a great time with the Corolle stroller that we also got for her first doll."
3,smaller than excpected,"I bought this for my niece as a Christmas gift. She loves taking care of her babies so I thought this would be a nice addition to her collection. It is a very cute baby bed but VERY small. I'm sure the product description gave measurements but I really didn't pay much attention I guess, my fault. Still a very cute item and maybe one of her smaller dolls will fit."
5,A spectacular debut album,"Wow, I am so glad that I had bought this CD, I actually was a huge fan of incubus, so I had already known about these guys for a pretty long while. However, since these two are indeed related, don't be fooled by MTV News & the annoying YM Magizine that they have the same sound...Dirty Sexy Knights in Paris is probaly, my favorite debut album since Coldplay. Audiovent are very much, that kind of band where it doesn't take up to 5-6 CD's to master their sound or perhaps music for any of that matter. These guys know what there doing, and they deserve a big hug just for that!!"
3,"Good, but...","...not as good as True Democracy or African Holocaust. If you don't have either of those albums, get them first. This album is still great roots reggae in its own right, though, even though there are a lot synths and electronic sounds which I don't like as much as real horns and instruments. The best songs are ""Steppin' Out"" and ""Roller Skates"" (probably the best one). Its good, but not essential Steel Pulse."
5,Have you ever been to Rio?,"I have never physically been to Rio, but mentally I take a trip there every time I listen to Carnaval. The percussion on this CD in incredible, and since I love drums I love this CD. This one makes me want to dance (ok ~ they all make me want to dance). Some people may not understand my fascination, however if they were to see Benise perform these songs live they just might understand. They must been seen live to be fully appreciated."
3,"the ""reviewers"" only review Benise!","I saw Benise on TV...looks very interesting. However, when I went to buy a CD, I see many reviews that seem to be by reviewers who only seem to review Benise! Which make me suspicious of these reviews being a concerted PR push, which I don't like. I did enjoy the Benise PBS presentation, however.So I'll still buy his CDs..."
4,Literary joke becomes sensual masterpiece...,"No one knew sensuality like the ""Sapphic"" Greeks and no one knew the ""Sapphic"" Greeks like Pierre Louys... well at least he liked to pretend that was the case. The fact is he (or his imagination) was so completely immersed in this culture that his images/syntax/symbols were authentic enough to dupe contemporary classics scholars of his day. Bilitis could have been a protege of Sappho... a literary force in her own right."
1,Not worthy of this wonderful authors name.,"The work of Ernest Holmes is without doubt some of the truest and most inspiring new thoughts books in print, With noticable exception of the Wilder Publications version offered by Amazon. This is a very unprofessional badly designed cheap and cheerful edition of a classic work that is unworthy of the authors name. They have even spelt the authors name incorrectly, correct on the front cover and incorrect on the back. The page design is poor and uninteresting. The size of the type is far too small, if this is to concerve paper then why are there blank filler pages at the back? I would like my money back or exchange it for the original publishers copy. Dave Gannaway Florida."
5,Good stuff,"We have a 97 Jeep Cherokee and the black vinyl wheel surround (not sure of the term) had faded terribly, they were almost a whitish grey. We applied about 3 coats of this product (it goes on easily with the applicator bottle it comes with). The first coat was splotchy because the vinyl soaked up the stuff. Then, by the 2nd and 3rd coat, it was becoming more of an even coat. Whalaa, I cannot believe the difference. I will try to post before and after pictures. It has made a huge difference in how the vehicle looks, and now we will see how it holds up over time. We had enough to do three coats around all four wheels. There seems to be enough in the bottle to repeat another treatment if necessary in the future. I would recommend this product."
4,Fantastic memories,"I bought this double album when it first came out - on vinyl. I loved it so much that I completely wore it out.It had a power and individuality that was totally unlike the more conventional rock and roll I was listening to in those days. I happened to be reading Romola Nijinska's biography of Nijinsky at the same time I was first listening to AIU, and the two have stayed together in my mind as emblems of artistic difference and personal expression within established genres.It's definitely not for everyone. The Japanese influence can be off-putting to people who are accustomed to a richer vocal timbre and western harmonic progressions. But if you like rock and roll, enjoy something intelligently different, and are open to a bit of Japanese edginess, this is something really special."
1,I'm a bit surprised,"My guess is that Yoko Ono is having some employees come onto Amazon and write reviews. If not that then I don't have an explanation for the glowing reviews received by this album on here. I checked it out as it was supposed to be Yoko in a more conventional sense, dropping the performance artist flare and really getting down to the music. What it showed me is that she has no singing talent. A complete waste of money and time."
2,Misleading Title,"The title of this book is misleading (Getting to know ArcGIS Desktop: The basics of ArcView, ArcEditor, and ArcInfo). This book is strictly on ArcView, and only briefly mentions Editor and Info. This is for someone who has never worked with ArcView 8.x and needs some info to get started, not for an experienced user."
5,captivated my second grader!,"Bought this for my 7.5 year old son, who is a good reader but rarely reads by choice, only by homework assignment. He couldn't wait to read this one, and finished it quickly giggling all the way through! I will definitely be buying more Captain Underpants books!"
4,Silly and fun!,"In the last book Mr. Krupp, the grumpy principal who students George and Harold accidentally hypnotized into believing he was a comic book superhero got real life super powers after tangling with a trio of evil aliens. Those powers are going to come in handy because in this book George, Harold and Captain Underpants are going to have to defeat a crazy scientist who's mad because everyone keeps making fun of his name.The Captain Underpants books are part comic, part story, all hilarious (and inappropriately so, as George and Harold point out, making fun of their own franchise, and meta-storytelling.) They're a series of fun books and increasingly George and Harold are shaping up to be real heroic good guys, capable sidekicks to Captain Underpants' outrageous, goofy goodness.Recommended for: 7- 12 yr olds"
4,This is a funny book,Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants is funny because all of the people have funny names and a guy who runs around in his underpants saving people. Goerge and Harold are two boys who like to play practical jokes on people. Sometimes the jokes go to far and get them in big trouble. Professor Pippy P. Poopypants is a new teacher and trys to take over the school by taking control of the Gerbil Jogger 2000 and shrinking the school with his Shrinky-Pig 2000.I like this book because the people have werid machines in this book. It is a funny book. They turn there principal into a funny person. I recommend this book for people who have imaginations.
1,No Praise for Professor Poopypants,"This is the kind of book that makes liberal parents consider the merits of censorship. The book has a very weak plot and undeveloped characters, so the author relies on bathroom humor and gimicks like a ""flip-o-rama"" to appeal to children who may not yet know the difference between this and good literature."
5,Nice case,"For the money, this little case is great. It does the job, and protects the unit, and the controls all still work fine. The only improvement might be if it could be made more water resistant, but thats a minor complaint."
5,Excellent Protection,When I first got my Sansa I thought it was great except that it was really delicate.... with this cover on it I have no worries just throwing the mp3 player in a bag... it is very durable. I was skeptical of the price at first but this is definitely worth it.
4,Speck Products ToughSkin Case for Sansa e200,"I love my big ""mil-spec"" Speck Products ToughSkin Case for my Sansa e200. I was fairly easy to slip the screen protector and the big case onto my Sansa and although a little bulky it is very tough. It makes it a little difficult to spin the control wheel but I still like it. I run Rockbox on my Sansa and recommend it!"
1,time to update,"This book had one or 2 pages of useful information... The rest is out of date, vague and misleading. Get a good Doc to help you with this stuff."
2,Too much waste,The goldfish's waste is all slimy in the filter after we started using this food. Other than that it is fine.
3,RIP OFF but good product,"I use this for my goldfish betta (passed) guppies (passed) in one tank. they shared it and they couldnt get enough, my turtle also in the same tank love it. But walmart has this same can for 11 dollars!"
3,Just read it,"Albeit by far this is not the best IJ's book it'll keep you reading. The problem is that a 21 years kid, or young girl, or gal, or filly, or whatever you can call her, makes all the decisions and nobody can't stop her. Not even her parents, or boyfriend, or friends, or anybody. She decides to go after a goon by herself and everybody says: ""I don't agree but I can't stop you"". I think that this is a little bit far fetched. And at the end. The book doesn't have an end. So if you'll decide to read this book, just read it with out thinking too much and maybe you'll enjoy it."
1,"LAME, AND STUPID","THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE. I WOULD OF GIVEN IT 0 STARS IF POSSIBLE.JANE IS 20 GOING ON 50, AND TREVOR...CAN ANYONE SAY ""PEDIFILE"" ??HERE'S A 34 YEAR OLD MAN WHO HAS LUSTED AFTER AND FOLLOWED A GIRL NOW AGE 20, SINCE SHE WAS SEVENTEEN. EWH....THE WHOLE THING IS JUST UNREALISTIC, AND BORING. I DONT EVEN THINK I CAN FINISH, THIS BOOK!!!"
3,Not her best,"I am a fan of Iris Johansen and like her Eve Duncan books but this one focuses on an adult ""Jane"". Johansen jumps 4 years ahead here and the attempt at bringing the reader up to date on Jane & Treavor moves very slowly. The story does pick up at the end with all the characters making a little sense. I sure hope this is not a sign that Ms. Johansen has gotten into just churning out books. This is 499 pages that probably could be around 400 and get the story out with less dragging.I am holding hope for her next couple of books and I hope she brings back her former ""get the reader hooked immediately"" style."
1,Disappointing,"This book was not one of the better ones from Iris Johansen. I felt it was missing some key components; character development,scene establishment, believeable dialogue, believeable plot, suspense, just to name several.I found the dialogue contrived. The characters lacked, well, character. The plot was patronizing.I wish I could be more positive about this one, but I really can't."
3,confused & semi-bored,"I found myself constantly going, ""Am I supposed to know this character??"" I knew this was a sequel to Blind Alley, but half the characters I don't remember, and it seemed like there were way too many of them to keep track of. Like the other reviewers, I have loved Iris's past books, and usually can't put them down. This one, however, I found myself saying, ""How many more pages before I'm done?""Ms Johansen needs to go back to stories that center around Eve & the reconstructions, or Sara and her dog...Jane is just not that interesting of a character to carry a whole book, or God-forbid, her own mini-series!!This is definitely one to pick up at the library--otherwise you'll find yourself donating it there afterwards."
5,Great Gift for a Diving Enthusiast,Beautifully photographs of the World's Best Sites; it was a wonderful gift for a friend who loves to dive with his family and is always looking for new sites.
2,Fat Cat 84 in Air Hockey table,I had heard that these were pretty good tables but was totally disappointed by the quality of this table. The supports on the table top are pretty thin pressed board as are the legs. Mine arrived with hairline cracks on the sides and the supports under the top. The table is turned on by a switch installed in the power cable which hangs below the table and is a pain to get at to turn it on. The display is powered by two AA batteries with a cover plate that has to be unscrewed with a screw driver to replace the batteries. This display is turned on separately and is easy to forget when turning off. Batteries won't last long if not turned off. The blower is weak but does give the minimum amount of performance. Assembly was quick and easy because there aren't many parts.
5,Extraordinary,I just finished reading reviews by others and can't believe they had problems with the recipes. Both technique and recipes are spectacular as always with Julia Child. I have made a number of recipes from this book and all were more than excellent. The presentation itself is inspirational.
4,Great recipes!,This was one of the best Julia Child cookbooks ever. It was bought as a birthday gift for my mom.
2,Toast too dark,"Even on the lowest setting, the toast is too dark for my liking. Also, the on light stays lit so you have to unplug it to avoid wasting electricity. Not the quality I expected from Cuisinart."
2,Cuisinart CPT 120R Electronic Toaster,"This toaster is pretty and looks good in the kitchen, however DOES NOT lightly toast regular bread. Even on the first setting your toast is very brown. The second setting the toast was burnt. The other features seem to work correctly put I had to watch them closely. I would not recommend this product to friends or family."
2,Good toast?,"Cheap construction, usage complicated and if you likegood toast for breakfast get any other toaster and do not recommended."
1,Don't do it! Seriously,"Unfortunately I did not look at the reviews on this particular model before purchasing. It seems that this toaster has either an 'incredibly great toaster' review or like mine, don't waste your money. This toaster was completely disappointing. The toaster has nine settings and yet you burn your toast at anything over two. One side will be burnt and the other not even toasted. It also seems to devoid the bread of any moisture which for my tastes is unpleasant. Think, brick toast. I truly wish that I had kept my $10 Procter-Silex Walmart special. Spare yourself the hassle."
2,This Toaster is Beautiful but . . .!,"Like all Cuisinart products, this toaster is very attractive; however, performance is another matter. At setting 2, it adequately toasts on one side and barely toasts the other. Any higher setting results in burning on one side. I've kept it only because this is probably my fourth choice. I can't seem to find a toaster that really works."
1,Not up to Cuisinart standards,We were extremely disappointed with the toaster. It only toasts well on one side; one has to turn the bread over. We are usually pleased with Cuisinart products; this is definately an exception.
2,Plight of the Eggo Waffle,"Everytime I try to cook an Eggo waffle in this toaster it only ""cooks"" one side and by cooks I mean burns. I'm very unhappy with it so much that I'm going to buy a new one. I even tried putting it on the lowest setting too. Maybe I just got a bad one but I do not reccomend this toaster."
3,instructs owner to unplug each time after use - otherwise light stays on.,As a toaster it's OK. but having to plug it in whenever one needs to toast something - is ridiculous and unacceptable.
1,"Uneven toasting, poorly made","From the beginning, this toaster toasted the bread more on one side than the other. You had to rotate the toast halfway through the process. I've had the toaster for about 2 years and today the lever just stopped working and won't hold the toast down. I'm pretty disappointed with this product."
3,"Works well, don't care for design.","This file works very well. It smoothes my rough feet probably better than anything else I have used. However, I wouldn't have bought it knowing that you had to put it together - i.e. remove the backing on the filing strips and stick them on the device. That would benefits pedicurists, for reusing equipment, but to me that means that I have to replace the strips also at some point. I don't like the idea of having to purchase parts for a foot file. For accomplishing it's goal, to smooth my feet - I give it 5 stars, but in design, I give it 1 star."
4,OPI Pedicure Foot File,It is the best foot file I have ever used it smooths out the callouses on your heel to a very soft smooth feel.Diane from Tumwater
1,Did not meet expectations,"Although Consumer Reports gave it a great review, mine has so much static that I can hardly understand people talking. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I quit using it."
1,"Great, but poor quality",Motorola dropped the bomb on this headset. I have seen MANY people complaining about the boom sensor being faulty and it just recently happened to me. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
3,Painful to connect to my Blackberry but finally...,"I won't say I am 100% happy with this puppy: it took a number of attempts on my own and a trip to the nearest T-Mobile store to get it to like my Blackberry Pearl. But finally, after the two of them get along well with each other, I am a happy camper.My only complain now: seeing how I can find a number of less expensive options in Amazon, within days of having purchased this one. I feel inclined to return it... It's not like I am attached to it by now."
2,Disappointing Voice Quality,"I didn't have much trouble connecting this device with my BlackBerry 8100 Pearl or my MacBook. I was able to use it with iChat and Skype, but everyone complained about the voice quality. There was constant static and the signal seemed to fade in and out. This is my first bluetooth headset, so maybe others have the same problem, but the quality was unacceptable for my use. I have returned this product and will try a different model/brand."
3,Summer T.,"I enjoy the sleek size and look of the product. Fits nicely around the ear and has clear reception. However the one problem that even a replacement has not resolved, is the product will redial the last dialed number with the boom closed. While in my shirt pocket, if the button is somehow press, the headset will repeatedly dial the last number over and over until the button is longer suppress. The product somehow needs to be reviewed to prevent the headset from dialing while the boom is closed.Additionally if the headset sets idle for several hours, it will somehow lose it's connection with the phone and I'll have to turn the phone off and back on again and reset the headset to get it connected again.The product somehow needs to be reviewed to prevent the headset from dialing while the boom is closed and somehow prevent it from losing its connection when not in use.Will be a nice product when and if the company fixes the few issues."
3,"Must have a ""skinny face.""","Everyone I've called has commented that I sound muffled until I pull the microphone portion slightly away from from my face (not fun to do while driving). Besides that it's really not a bad unit. But, the microphone placement is clearly a design flaw. I bet it's discontinued very, very soon."
3,Good performance / poor durability,"This headset worked exactly as advertised by the manufacturer. Great in noisy areas, good voice quality, and easy to use. However, drop this on anything harder than a pillow and you can expect it to start giving you problems. The headset fell out of my pocket 3 times in the couple of months I had it and now it rattles on the inside and works when it wants to. The durability needs to be better on this to recommend it in good conscience."
1,No range and too much static,"I bought this headset with high hopes. I have a Jabra JX-10 and love it, but thought that the H700's ""flip open the boom to answer"" feature was really cool. It is, except for the fact that you have to keep the phone within two feet of the headset or there is a tremendous amount of static. My Motorola H820 has much better range,(although without the noise cancelling microphone) and my Jabra JX-10 is in a completely different league. This headset works great if you hold the phone close to the headset, but that pretty much defeats the purpose. I would not recommend the H700 to anyone. But if you want to try one, check e-bay. This p.o.s. is going on the market."
5,Easy to Pair and Great Sound,"I've paired this with a Samsung M510 and HTC-PPC6800. On both it works great! No problems hearing someone or they hearing you. I like the folding (power-saving) option. To get better range, when pairing it with your phone place the H700 atleast 15 feet away. I wish this would have A2DP for use a regular headphone (mono) then it would be perfect."
3,Funny Fit/Fuzzy Sound,"I found the earpiece to have two problems. First, it does not positively fit to the ear. it feels like it's just hanging there. Second, the sound from the mike makes my voice kind of fuzzy."
4,Not as comfortable as I would like but overall a very good product,"I bought one for myself and one for my wife. As with many people I didn't read all of the instructions which may or may not explain why at certain times after making a call, the other party couldn't hear me talk but I could hear them. That has happened on a few occasions. The ear piece gets uncomfortable after 10-15 minutes. A soft pad around the piece would be the perfect solution. All in all I am satisfied with the product."
2,Not too good if ambient noise is about,"I hate it. It sort of works. It looks great but has some problems:PROS:- looks good.- nice lightsCONS:- has trouble with ambient noise due to mike type, I'm guessing.- people complain I 'sound like I'm in a tunnel'- cuts out- due to poor mike, my voice recognition on my Samsung [BEST voice recognition on the market, requires NO voice training] constantly make mistakes or doesn't understand me: NOT GOOD.- seems to loose connectivity with phone, but might be my phone: which is only two months old or about Sept. '07. go figure.- Cannot stray more than 12 feet no matter where I am.- have sometimes found it cannot keep connection even with phone in visor and thing in my ear. WTF!Really soured me on bluetooth....Heard the new Jabra is something to look at, and is a far cry from their first releases.might look at Samsung, too.Will be puting on AMAZON for sale...two months old...look for it."
2,"Doesn't work in car, otherwise great","My only complaint is a big one for me: it doesn't work in the car. Once the car gets above 35 mph, the engine noise in my 2004 model year car apparently is too loud and muffles the conversations (even if I try to talk/yell louder). I still use it around the house, and people on the other end don't even know that I am on a bluetooth set. It pairs very easily with my VX 9400. However, the real reason for getting it was for the car, and it is a disappointment that it doesn't work. I've resorted back to a wired earpiece for now while driving."
4,Best blue tooth headset for Treo 650,"I have tried, tested and returned no less than a dozen other blue tooth headsets from various manufacturers and have found this model to be the best in fit, feel, and function.It is lightweight, fits comfortably on your ear (either side), seems to have unstoppable battery life (I can run all day, charging my Treo 650 2 or 3 times during the day and headset still works great). I actually bought this one for my wife as we have the same phone and mine has worked so well for me.The only reason it's not 5 stars is that the way the mic sits on my face it can cover the mic port once and awhile. I simply added a little rubber pad to the mic 'boom' so it sits off my face just enough to keep the mic hole from getting covered. My wife doesn't have this problem, might be an ear shape thing!? Other than that, it's awesome!"
2,"""Muffled""","My experience with the Motorola H700 has not been a good one. Just about EVERYONE I talk to say that my voice is not coming through clearly. Especially those who are using a Blackberry. A friend of mine suggested that I not use it when I'm talking to a client because it is very annoying. He said he has to listen very carefully in order to understand what I'm saying.I do however like the size and the comfort on my ear. However, I feel like I wasted my money. Too bad the reception is lousy, otherwise it would be a great piece of technology.P. Windham"
2,"Wanted to like this, but...","I read through all of the reviews for the various headsets before purchasing the H700. Previously, I was had a Jabra 250 that worked fine but did not fit well into my ear and the discomfort made it miserable to use.I loved the look and fit of the H700. The audio on my end was loud and clear, but the people I was calling could barely hear me. I tried everything I could think of to clear up the sound (held mic away from face, re-paired with phone several times, etc.) to no avail. I finally had to give up and I am returning the headset.The reviews for all of these headsets seem schizophrenic - half of the people love the headset and have no problems, the other half are like me and cannot get it to work. Perhaps the real issue is inconsistent quality in the manufacturing of these headsets??I am going to give the older Motorola H850 a try next..."
2,5 motorola bluetooth headsets,"I received 5. 2 of which did not work. Plus the packages had been opened and all music cds were removed. This caused me to believe that they were not the new ones I ordered, but refurbished."
1,Junk,Static like crazy. I am going back to my three year old jabra. If I cant find the receipt for this one it is going in the east river.
3,Lots of static when you are moving around.,This was an overall good product.When you are sitting still it seems to work fine.It produced alot of static when I was moving around.You can get better for your money.
3,Bluetooth,"I only used it once in my apt but the reception was so fuzzy and not at all what I expected. From other reviews I thought it would be clear like a bell but it was much worse than my recption from my phone which is very good. This was just after I had charged it should have been very good. I will try it again but am a little skeptical, and I purchased this one because it had the best reviews...."
1,disappointing,i tried the motorola h700 with 2 motorola phones (v557 & razr v3) and not only would it not stay connected to the phone (which was in my pocket or on the desk) but the sound quality was terrible-- when it didn't drop the call altogether...if i could give it less than 1 star i would.
1,HELP,"I ordered the Motorola H700 bluetooth on 8/29/11. It arrived on 9/19/11 and will not hold a charge. I have 3 different chargers which fit the H700, including one that came with the product, and the bluetooth will not take or hold a charge. I have complained to the vendor, The City Trends, and have still not received a resolution for the problem, which is that they have my money and I have a product that I can't use. Several emails have passed between us without resolution and I am a very dissatisfied customer at this point. Help me please Amazon!"
4,Motorola H700,"It's a nice unit, simple to use. Battery life seems decent, although I am not a ""power user"". I use it with a Slvr L6 when I'm on the road and it is definitely a plus to be wireless and hands free while driving. People I have talked to say I sound different when I am using this unit. It may be road noise in the car, I'm not sure."
1,False Advertising - Do Not Buy From WIreless Emporium,"The ONLY reason I selected this vendor was because it specifically states 'Motorola Packaging' in the description. The packaging is a generic plastic case with the merchandise shoved in UPSIDE DOWN for display and the earpiece itself in a ziplock bag inside the casing. As I said, the only reason I purchased from this vendor is because I wanted to make sure it had a brand name look - the real packaging from Motorola, etc. because this was to be a gift in a few days for our son. Now I'm faced with having to go somewhere and purchase a nice looking gift and demanding a refund. As I said, save yourself the headache and DO NOT purchase from this vendor, do not be fooled by the ""Motorola Packaging"" - there's nothing on it that says Motorola - all it states is Universal Bluetooth Headset - and that it's compatible with Motorola."
3,ehh..,it keeps breaking off reception. u cant talk away from your phone more than 3 steps. low battery and its not worth it. sometimes it good. sometimes its not.
1,Unable to use!,I don't know whether the unit I purchased was defective or it is a universal problem but after trying to use this headset for around one week I finally decided to return it. Most of the time I got a distorted signal and could not hear what the person on the other end of the line was saying. I also had complaints from people indicating that I was very difficult to hear or understand.
2,can't hear me,"Everyone that I talked to complained they couldn't hear me well, there was too much static. People were talking *over* me because they didn't even know I was talking!Now it's broken, I've had for 4 months. I'm glad it's broken now, because I have an excuse to buy a different one."
3,"Good, but not quite there","The Motorola H700 headset is a decent piece of equipment, but I have a few issues with it still: 1) The battery is always dead! Why? Because of the fact that this device does not have any sort of neck lanyard (like the HS850), you have a tendancy to carry it in your pocket, purse, bag, etc. When you do this, it is very easy for the ""call button"" on the side to become slightly depressed. When this happens, the battery drains quickly. So, in order not to have your battery die, place the H700 in a location where NOTHING will touch it when not in use (i.e., when not on your head); 2) when answering a call on my Motorola V551 phone, if I try to transfer the call to my H700 headset after using the phone's handset, it doesn't work; the voice on the other end disappears--the H700 only works when I initiate a call with the headset on. This is extremely annoying, especially when driving in the car; 3) actual talk time is 5.5 hours, not 6 hours."
1,Ink scam!,"I only print in black and white, but according to the FAQs it still uses up the colour ink to keep the colour heads clean. The problem is that once the colour cartridges are empty, it does not let you print in B&W anymore. You are FORCED to buy three new colour cartridge even though you do not need or want them. Also when only one colour cartridge goes empty, it forces you to replace the other two even though they have enough ink left."
1,Do NOT buy this,"This printer worked fine for me for about a year but it suddenly started having the same problem as these other reviewers, IT STOPPED PRINTING! I suggest getting another printer for your purposes."
4,Works great with Macintosh,"I have not experienced any conflicts. It is a little slower and the software is clunkier, but it WORKS. After a horrible experience with HP products, I am happy with this model. And at a great price."
1,Mistake! Mistake! Waste of Money!,"On Sept. 1,2005 I purchased a brand new Epson CX4600 and all the supplies(extra ink cartridges,USB Cable). Today(Sept. 2,2005, the printer is not working! It will not feed paper and when it does decide to feed a sheet, it comes out blank! No print. The really sad part is that I bought this printer for business purposes and it has made it impossible to do any business! I make personalized shirts until now! I was right in the middle of completing a large order due on Saturday Sept 3,2005 and can not finish if the printer won't print anything! It goes back today for a different brand. Maybe Canon is more reliable? I rate this printer a big fat ZERO!"
2,Trouble from the start-now it's dead.,"I don't print a lot, and mostly text when I do. This printer was trouble from the beginning. I bought it new--not refurbished or anything. Upon installation, had to email tech support right out of box--nothing was printing. They advised me to repeatedly clean the nozzle (7-10 times in a row). This takes a lot of ink. Periodically throughout past year, had to do the same. Ink cartridges are expensive and even with my low volume printing--they don't last long. I'm one week beyond the year from purchase date where they would replace the unit and it's DEAD. I won't be buying another."
5,Beats the HP 1209 hands down!,"I bought the HP 1209 and had nothing but problems. The CD's software did not install properly. I had to download a 100 meg+ file to take its place. Then I couldn't seat the paper in a predictable fashion, so printing business card labels was impossible; they kept being off center.I ended up so unhappy that I returned it. I did some research and found this baby for only $10 more than the HP, and it's in a whole different class!Software installation was a snap (though it took a long time), totally hands-off. Printing was easy, and looking through the apps it loaded on my machine, I'd say it's going to be a fun ride. Plus I now have a card reader, so I can take both the card reader and scanner I owned previously off my desk.I'm a happy Epson customer. I've owned HP printers since the '80s, but they lost me this time."
5,Wonderful,"I haven't read this book in...ten years or so, but as soon as I read the title 'TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO, I LOVE THAT BOOK'. That pretty much covers it. It's wonderful, I wish the kids I am around would be patient enough to listen to it. :) WONDERFUL WONDERFUL BOOK!"
5,THIS IS IT,This is the real deal!! A wonderful book about a young chinese man with a very long name. Its a great bedtime story. Short and sweet. Honest and pure...clean...perfect for children. I read it to my husband and he even enjoyed the tale of the young chinese man with the very long name.....
1,An album of screaming by the woman who broke up The Beatles,For this Lennon traded away The Beatles? Has anyone ever made such a bad decision?
1,Two Sentence Review,"It is not often that even AMAZON tells the plain truth of just how hated an album is.Ms. Ono, you have earned that honor--and I mean EARNED."
5,"Simple design, striking idea.",The drill holder is a Columbus's egg sort of product. Design being simple the holder's function is greatly appreciable. Its idea is a striking thing. The drill holder is worth for an award.
5,Unbelievable,"Although the Smiths are one of my all-time favourite bands, I was never the biggest fan of Morrissey's solo work. Until now. This is an absolutely amazing album!!! It has a lot of 80's and Smiths undertones to it. Irish blood, English heart is already a classic."
5,Mussic by Moss,"I GREW UP WITH MORRISSEY'S MUSIC SINCE HIS GROUP THE SMITHS BACK IN THE EARLY 80'S, JOHN LENNON WAS NEVER THE BEATLES OR PETER MURPHY WAS NEVER BAUHAUS, AND TO EXPECT THIS ALBUM TO SOUND LIKE OTHER MORRISSEY ALBUMS OR EVEN THE SMITHS ALBUMS I THINK WOULD'NT BE FAIR FOR HIM, JUST LIKE ME MORRISSEY HAS GROWN UP AND LIKE AN ARTIST HE TENDS TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERES AND SOUNDS, SOMEBODY SAID THIS SOUNDED LIKE CHEAP ELECTRONIC EFFECTS, C'MON THIS MUSIC IS NOT NEAR A SELL-OFF LIKE SO MANY DISPOSABLE POP-RAP-HAPPY PUNK BANDS OUT THERE. THE VOICE & LIRICS ARE STILL MORRISSEY, AND IF YOU'RE NEW TO MOSS I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THE ""BONA DRAG"" ALBUM FIRST."
2,Really Disappointed,"I expected to buy a really good CD. I ABSOLUTELY love the song ""Irish Blood, English Heart."" But, that is the only song that I will listen to on the whole CD. The rest of the songs are mediocre."
5,The Eyeballs are Watching!,"This is a great compilation of the Residents. It has in my opinion, a representation of a hit/s from everyone of their albums up to the point of this compilation. It includes 10 of the 1 minute jingles from the Commercial album. One of my favorites ""SKINNY"" from the album Duckstab is also here. Other standouts include ""IT'S A MAN'S WORLD"", ""THIRD REICH AND ROLL"", ""WEED"", and ""CONSTANTINOPLE"". The music is weird,fun,synth-laden and deconstructed 60's pop with a punk edge. The Residents sound like no other band and their the pioneers of this genere-whatever it may be called. I like how they've kept their anonimity with their eyeball heads/masks(on their later albums) and top hat and tails attire."
2,IS IT OVER YET???,"This was a tedious and torturous read. I have not read something this boring since Mrs. Smith's 6th grade introduction to Science booklet. I am not one who usually rates any book under a three star rating, but I felt compelled to warn my fellow readers of this one. I found myself wanting to walk away from the book several times, but I pride myself in never doing that. Now, I truly wish that I had stopped after the first chapter."
4,Good storage,"A great storage building for a small space but VERY confusing to put together. The instructions for the shed are for 2.5 by 5 and then you get directions for an extension of 2.5 by 5. You have to move between the sets of directions which causes alot of confusion. Once constructed, it is structually sound and attractive."
4,My papa liked it,"I bought this for my father as he owns a copy of the original and is a big fan. The art in this new version is sharp and interesting to look at and the translation is inspired. In doing this, the grotesqueness is turned down quite a bit which is the appeal of the original."
4,Great drama of the effects of greed,"This is a very interesting film on the study of the effects of greed. Both stars give excellent performances. Definitely hold your interest. The movie deserves 5 stars, but this CinemaScope production is shown in a pan and scan version. Does the original widescreen version not exist? Still, it is a powerful film."
1,avoid Microsoft mice like the plague!,"I will never again buy another Microsoft Mouse! I received one of these as a Christmas gift, and Microsoft has changed the Intellipoint software so that you cannot map different keyboard keys to the buttons. You are obligated to choose from the ""dumbed-down"" list of commands that Microsoft has deemed ""useful to everyone."" I had an earlier version of this product a few years ago, and it was great for CAD, etc. because I could program the mouse buttons to work in specific programs, but now that appears impossible. Also, the ""tilt-wheel"" is useless in my opinion. I can already tell I will get chafing on my fingers from pushing the stupid wheel side-to-side. What's wrong with two wheels?"
4,ms optical mouse,"I really like this mouse. Great, simple design - easliy used in R or L hand. Smooth action. I had read reviews citing problems with the scroll wheel, I haven't noticed any problems.I use it mostly for general use (web-browsing, word processing, etc) and some graphics use (photoshop and illustrator mostly). Can't complain about anything!"
5,Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse - Great on spreadsheets,"If you work a lot with big spreadsheets you're going to love this mouse. The horizontal scrolling button helps you big time, you no longer have to be scrolling using the scroll bar on excel. The ergonomic design is great, fits perfect in your hand, you're actually resting your hand on it. The installation is quite simple and user friendly, you're going to have your mouse installed in 5 minutes."
4,My favorite mouse yet...,"So far this has been the best mouse that I've ever owned. It is just for home use, but I love not having yet another cord to get tangled. Battery life is pretty good compared to other wireless peripherals that I've used. The weight is perfect - not too heavy, yet not so light that I accidentally knock it off my desk. The color choice is a nice option as well. I've never been a fan of Microsoft products in general (I prefer Logitech) but for some reason I really do prefer this particular mouse despite the brand. Overall, I definitely recommend this mouse."
3,Weight and size wrong,"Just a warning that the weight and size is wrong in the product description.It weighs 7 3/8 oz and is 4 1/4""I was hoping for a smaller and lighter tool than the Leatherman Wave that I already have. This is not smaller and not much lighter. I prefer the Wave in this size class."
2,In retrospect--two years later,"After listening to this CD for two years, giving it many second chances, and listening to MB for the last six, it must be said that like all new, slick, hip material it has not aged well. Like a can of Cola left open for two years, it's gone rather flat and sticky. Take the wow-ee-zow-ee drum and bass machine out of it and what do you have? A pretty amazing instrumentalist who loves his weed (see the liner notes). I wonder what Martyn would sound like sober and solo. A whiter shade of pale, perhaps? Or, something really exciting, and lasting?"
4,music for the world: poetic and hypnotic,"Thank you, Martyn, for your attitudes and also, on one cut, introducing me to the poetry of Sorley MacLean. Your next effort will include Hindi film music, perhaps, something NASA related, germane and urbane?"
1,Bollocks,"This haz got to be the worst crap ive ever heard...i mean who really wonts to listen to a womand screaming and making noises for half an hour!?This is v sort of fing that shows you that John Lennon woz SOMETIMES a con artist!Dont get me wrong, im quite a big Lennon fan, i mean i bort imagine album, and DOUBLE FANTISY(Lennons best album in my opinion) but vis album is purely con, purely crap, and purely a waste of time...dont spend money on it!"
1,Would rate at ZERO stars if possible.,"The best way to describe this album in one word would be ""RIP-OFF"". It is a terrible waste of anyone's money to buy this collection of pointless noises and electronic feedback. That's the entire content of the audio recording of this package. The only selling feature is the nude cover photo of John and Yoko, and that's not worth a second look. From someone who got stuck with this expensive trash, take this advice: don't buy Two Virgins, Life With the Lions, or Wedding album. These albums are a terrible waste of money, and with the thousands and thousands of CD's you could select that exhibit genuine creative talent, let this worthless CD not be considered."
1,Total idiots,"John & Yoko are nothing more than complete idiots. I don't know what in the world those two were thinking, but I'm not impressed. They made themselves look really stupid. I think it's garbage. 'Nuff said."
1,Pretty good if you're really high,I first listened to this album at a friends house. We both had consumed a fairly large quantity of Shrooms and were also smoking marijuanna at the time. I had also just drunk about a six pack of coors.Most people might claim I was in too altered a state of mind to effectively make any type of judgement on the musical ability of Yoko Ono or the quality of this particular Album.I would counter that argument by saying that being in any Sober state of mind while listening to Yoko Ono is in itself equivalent to mental and physical torture. At least when you're high her music makes you giggle.So by this album if you're going to get really high...I guess thats the point I'm trying to make.
1,"OH! NO, Mr. Bill, Its YOKO!","More screaming and stupidity from Yoko-san! Worse yet, this is a double disc! The music on this CD should be outlawed as cruel and unusual punishment."
3,"Creepy score is not Young'sbest, but still good","Christopher Young created one of the best scores ever for a horror film, but this is not it. That score was for Hellraiser and those expecting the dark melodies of that film in this score with be disappointed. The first track contains the best work and will gets listeners hopes up high, but the rest of the album is listless and lifeless. The End Title track is fairly good but you will be hard pressed to find something that stands out from all the humming and hissing in between."
3,Ionic Pro Air Purifier,"Not sure I can tell a difference in the air quality. The noise I read about in other reviews has only been the sound of static, and only when the filter blades need cleaned. I found that operating the unit on Medium is just as efficient & the time between cleaning the blades is much longer than when operated on High. Overall, I'm glad I paid less for this unit compared to the Ionic Breeze unit by Sharper Image."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I fail to understand ANY of the positive reviews of this item since it so obviously doesn't work. I've been running it now for several months in a very dusty house (with 3 dogs, no less) and it hasn't removed enough dust to bother with-certainly no where near what the manufacture claims. And given the cost of the unit, hardly justifiable.It's just another attempt of corporate America (or maybe China,I don't know) inventing any gimmick to relieve consumers of their hard-earned cash.You're far better off buying one of the $20 fan-driven units that have been around for years. In spite of the drawbacks to these units, they do work.If you're in the market for a tall, black, ugly, object that takes up space in your living room, by all means buy this!So one more time: IT DOESN'T WORK! IT'S A PIECE-OF-CRAP! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Works but not that good>,I got this brand new i have it turned on all the time. You can feel a light breeze when its working I mean light . It does collect some dust but a small amount my house is a dusty place . I haven't really notice any change what I have notice is a strong musk electric smell when its on . If you think this will stop from you having to dust it wont you still need to dust. All in all I would say save your money buy one with HEPA filter .
1,Ozone Generator,"This thing is literally an ozone generator. I turned it on and immediately was hit in the face with a wall of ozone. Within minutes there was so much ozone in the room, I had to shut it off. Even on low setting, I can't go to sleep. If you are looking for a good ozone generator, buy this. If you want an air purifier, get one with a blower motor and an air filter. Forget the ""ionic"" type. And that includes the Orick. They don't work!"
2,Ionic Pro is noisy.,"When I first bought the Inoic Pro I was really happy with the product. We had just finished construction in the house and the Inoic Pro really cleaned up the dust. However, about 1-2 months later, the my Ionic Pro started to make little static noises. Eventually, the noises became more persistent and non-stop. While the Inoic Pro works, it's to0 noisy to leave on, it almost sounds like one of those blue light bug zappers you use during the summer and the Inoic Pro is zapping a bug every 30 seconds. I really hope that there is a way to complain to the manufacturer of this problem because for the price, it really would have been a great product."
5,Highly recommended!,"How To Interview Like a Top MBA, by Shel Leanne, is extremely well written and provides great insight into how to interview excellently for a job. The topics covered in the main text are very timely, with chapters about situations in which you may be trying to get a more advanced position, as well as ways to approach a job interview if you have been out of work for a while or if you are transitioning to a new field. The book also has a very valuable sample 100 Questions and Answers section. This book was thoughtful and insightful, and the advice from headhunters and recruiters add great dimensions."
3,Terrible,I got a thousand times better tips on a 2 buck kindle bookInterview tips from a chronic job hopperthan I did this book.
2,NO PHOTOS!,Where are the photos in this book? Take a tip from Martha Stewart and add photos in your next book.
1,wrong part,i ordered a spline to sds max and got a a spline to sds plus(never heard of sds plus. thought that would be the max.i was wrong).i would like to return this item. how do i do this?
4,decent entry,"While I used to love the Race Against Time series, I think this one was just about the only one I didn't love, although I still liked it a lot. It was a pretty good entry in the series as Stephen and Uncle Richard battled the bad guys in Scotland. The Kronom KD2 watches were cool, as always. I think you might like it."
4,rev123,"The printer is small and looks great. It is very fast and print qaulity is also good. My only complain is that when I press the one touch toner save buttone, the toner save light does not come on. The only way I can put the printer in toner save mode is to set it from the print menu. This does not bother me so much. This is a great printer considering the price of $60 or so afger rebate."
1,Total dud. Landfill it.,Put simply this product does not work. I have barely 200 pages of print off of this model before it simply failed to feed paper. Investigating the issue the rubber roller that feeds the paper is all dried out and cracking. The printer is basically new and parts are already faulty on the item. It is a piece of JUNK. Samsung I thought was a reliable mfgr. They have ruined their reputation with this product.The only thing to turn my opinion around with Samsung is if they replace this item free of charge with printer that works past 200 copies.
4,Great Value!,"I purchased this printer for a very reasonable price after rebate, and I couldn't be more thrilled with it. It is a bit loud, but it cranks out pages very quickly. The print quality is acceptable to me. Some reviewers complained of gray text but it looks dark enough to me. It's also pretty small for a laser printer, and fits well under my bed.I've also used it with Windows XP, OS X 10.4.7 and Ubuntu Breezy Badger -- and it worked perfectly in all 3 operating systems! As another reviewer pointed out, you can use the ML 1710 driver in Ubuntu."
3,Great laser for the price but jams,"Bought this for $50 after discounts for school use. Jams ALL the time: often pulls 2 sheets from the paper tray, and when it heats up the pages start to stick together. I have to watch it very closely whenever printing anything over 10 pages, ready to fight with the bugger if it starts to jam. When it jams, things really get stuck because the internal rollers are very tight and don't move. Printing is aAlso, very noisy: it squeaks a lot and you can hear the rollers inside. Okay for light use but get a better printer if you need to print more than just a few pages now and then! I wish I had."
1,Frustrating!,"This printer constantly jams. Usually when I'm trying to print on the second side. So, I'll get 20 pages just fine, then it'll jam on the backside and ruin the page numbering. I'm no tree hugger, but I feel bad about wasting almost 40 pages each time I try to print a chapter for school."
1,Donnot buy this printer,"My professor insisted to get this printer for our daily printingjob, and now this machine is annoying to me. It prints Gray color, not black, no matter how hard I have tried the settings. I just need the right color, black, to print my Ph.D. dissertation, that is all. Donnot be alured by the price, the cheap price gives you an output that looks cheap. Donnot buy this one if you need to produce decent document."
4,"great sale @ local store, but linux/Mac users beware","I got it for under $50 - thanksgiving sale - local store.Worked perfectly right out of the box WITH WINDOWS 98.Had nothing but trouble getting it to work with Linux/Ubuntu5.10.Gave up. Hooked it to a Win98 PC, and shared it to print successfully from 2nd Win98 PC, but will not print from Ubuntu (via smbclient remote share or via print-admin).Basically, this printer is for windows-only world. But, man! was it cheap and BLOODY FAST too! tho' a little noisy in a small room. After a few minutes, power-save feature turns on, and the printer acts like its shutoff, but comes right back alive, when I print. I have no issues with its less-than-perfect black ink (some other people online complain its dark gray, not black).I m Keeping it."
2,Doesn't come with a data cable,"Great delivery, great price...but no warning anywhere that you need to purchase a USB cable separately. I lost my enthusiasm for this product as I drove to a less than convenient computer store just to get the printer working."
5,Be careful who you trust...!,This vid makes you think! Don't take anyone for granted or wrong someone you trusted with your secrets.
5,ACTION Film,The movie was casted and directed very well. Once again Vivica proves her talent as an actress. I think all would enjoy this film.
4,Surprisingly Good.,"I was truly surprised at what a good movie ""Motives""turned out to be. To be honest, when Irented this film, I expected to find yetanother tactless, corny tale of urban extremes.But what a surprise!I would recommend ""Motives"" to anyone. This isan engaging movie that you actually don't mindsitting through from start to finish. Of coursethere is a bevy of beautiful people and heatedsensuality, but the acting is no disappointmenteither.Moore does great and Fox delivers anotherconvincing portrayal of a jilted woman(but this time without going over thetop.....well, not so much).I believe this is a movie that youwouldn't mind seeing more than once.Great suspense and attractive actorscertainly help.This is a great movie for those searchingfor a nice thriller to add to theirmovie collection."
2,What are YOUR motives?,"Personally I really disliked this movie. It seemed like a A+ high school film project. Good, but very amateur.But you will like this movie for any of the following reasons- The great cast- The sex- If you love black men or black womenThe plot line seems to be thrown together to keep this from being a porno.I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends. But this might be the movie for you. You might enjoy it even if it doesn't have a well thought out plot line. The actors and actresses do a good job with the script given to them. It definitely has the potential of being a very enjoyable movie if you're into that sort of movie style."
1,Maybe its just mine... but mine is terrible.,"Purchased this as a stocking stuffer for our daughter. This recorder will not even change key, tone, or anything when you cover the holes. I'm not a professional musician, but this recorder is not like those I used when I was in grade school. You could actually play those.This is just basically a wooden tube with holes that you blow in. It is not an instrument with which to make music. It unfortunate because we have been happy with every other M & D toy purchase we have made, and there have been a bunch. Thanks for reading."
2,Broken in 2 days,"My 5 year old daughter received this recorder for Christmas. She's been wanting one for a while and decided that's what she was asking Santa for. Unfortunately, my 2 year old just threw the recorder down on our CARPETED family room floor and the top part of the recorder cracked and popped off. The plastic recorders usually disassemble into 3 pieces. This one, however, does not. It is one solid unit. Now, my 5 year old is downstairs crying and wanting another recorder. She'll have to have this exact one, or it won't be the same. I will buy another one, because it's like the first one. That's the only reason. The quality of this product is substandard to our many other Melissa and Doug toys. Don't expect too much from this one."
2,Disappointed,"We've generally had a lot of luck with Melissa & Doug products - they're usually well made, fairly priced and things our son enjoys playing with. This kazoo is an exception. It's almost impossible to get much sound out of this at all, let alone a sound that resembles a traditional kazoo. My wife and I have tried any number of techniques, including some offered in other Amazon reviews, and nothing gets much more than a muffled buzzing out of it. Our son is teething and the metal kazoo we have that he has a blast playing with has paint on it that we're concerned about him nibbling off. We also have a plastic one that sounds decent as well but were hoping that teething on wood would be less of an issue than plastic. Disappointed to find out that this one didn't fit the bill."
1,Not a good kazoo,"Doesn't work like a typical kazoo, vibrates if you hum in a certain way, but otherwise does not work as one would expect. Don't waste your money on this thing. Zero stars if it would let me, but it's making me pick one star."
3,not very easy to use,"of all the people in my house who tried it, only the youngest one, my son who is 2.5 knows how to make a sound out of this. Kind of strange, but the only thing that matters is he can use it."
2,"Too ""Basic""","I expected something more than what this publication offered. Instead of getting ""how to"" do a task I got ""this is""."
4,Rage's Mixtape,"Rage is back after too damn long to bring us a new mixtape, which was supposed to be a promo for a new album. It's mostly hits and/or new songs over other people's beats, but it's still pretty bangin'.Here's the tracklist:1. Intro To VA 2 L.A.2. I'm Comin'3. Put U Up On Rage (ft Diamonique)4. The West Needs Me5. D.P.G. Set (ft RBX & Goldie Loc)6. Ten Pimp Commandments (ft Doc Strange)7. No, No, No!!!8. VA Mo Money9. Afro Puffs (Original & Remix) (ft Snoop Doggy Dogg)10. Boss Lady11. Bow Down12. There They Go (ft Doc Strange)13. Get 'Em Girl14. Unf*ckwitable15. Old Skool16. The Interview (Interlude) - The Poetess17. Str8 Outta VAPeace,D"
2,Not Great,"This item protected the phone great, but was bulky and caused some of the buttons not to function correctly on the phone. I think that it may have been where one of the buttons was pressed by the case because it was not an OEM product and didn't fit perfectly. I ended up just using the front part of the case to protect phone."
5,You won't be disappointed,"Excellent choice for protecting your 8525. Snug fit, allows unrestricted access to the keyboard, doesn't add much bulk. Great look, but no screen protection. I agree with the other review here that says it isn't very grippy. His suggestion of adding a rubber foot is a very good solution, as it tends to slide around tables too easily.As a note, I already had an Invisible Shield on my phone when I put this case on. The Shield is pretty thin but it still prevents the case from comfortably snapping into place on the phone. It is a small peeve, as the front panel especially does not snap in (though the case still manages to stay on during normal use).Overall the best case compared to the alternatives when considering size, weight, cost, and protection."
4,"Well written, exciting even!","A very readable book. Contemporary events and characters in England, the colonies, and Europe are presented in a way which enables the reader to see how their interaction affects the war. Important characters are well developed, and the battles are described in just enough detail that they remain exciting.A major flaw is the lack of readable maps. ( I nearly wore out my atlas.) Most of the reproductions of original maps are virtually illegible, and a good portion of each map is obsured by the book binding."
