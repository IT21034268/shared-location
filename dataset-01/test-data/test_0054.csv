5,A Great Buy,"It is a great buy. For the low price you pay, you will be amazed by how much it can do for you. It allows you to take pictures at low light condition and take great portrait photos. There is nothing to complain about."
4,Please be aware this lens does not have image stabilizer,"It's a great lens, if you put it on a tripod!! I looked at the price and was about to fall over then i ordered the lens and started shooting with it, and all my shots came out blurry. This is a great portrait lens, but you absolutely need a tripod!!If you want the ""real thing"" it will cost you around $300..."
5,Perfect for most occassions,"I purchased this lens after reading various photography books and blogs. I have now used it for about a month and I am very impressed with the results. The potraits or indoor snaps that I took with this lens are amazing. Many of my friends who own SLR camera are leaning toward owning this lens once they saw the photos I took with this lens.Due to larger aperture(f1.8), the lens can create short depth of field and the effect of it is amazing. It easily defocuses the foreground and background of the subject which cannot be achieved with any other zoom lens (18-55; 18-135 etc). Recently I took some photos with Xmas light in the backgound, it created a beautiful effect of lights in the background by blurring the xmas lights.You can also use it on outdoor(daytime) setting by reducing aperture to greater than f3.5. I have this lens on my camera most time - I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking potrait or family snaps."
2,Wonderful Picture - Terrible Construction Quality,"This was my first lens, it produced absolutely wonderful pictures...especially portraits. I took it to Europe for my 5 week honeymoon and cared for it well, on the 4th week of use it literally fell apart in my hands. I sent it in under warranty and they fixed it and sent it back. Not 10 minutes of use later it fell apart again. I did get probably a 1000 pictures out of it before it fell apart but I am finally now going to purchase the 1.4 version of this lens, so I would have been better off just getting that one in the first place. I would say go ahead and spring for the 1.4, the used lens market prices are very high so even if you don't end up using it you can recoup your costs."
4,Portrait Lens,I shopped around for this Lens and this was by far the best value I found on the Net. Local camera stores do not even stock this type of Lens. The vendor provided fast service at the best price.
2,Don't understand all the hype,"I had this lens for a total of 2 days and returned it to the vendor.The majority of the reviews for this lens were good and the price was right so I figured I had nothing to lose by purchasing it.Upon taking the lens out of the box I did notice how light it was. After all, what would one expect for the price?Where this lens was disappointing was in its ability to focus consistently. I took about 30-40 sample shots at various exposure settings and the focus was hit or miss. The image quality for the in-focus pictures was pretty good, though. But with hit or miss focusing this lens just wasn't worth keeping in spite of the image quality.I'd consider this lens only if you have a lot of patience, are strapped for cash, and need something that has the potential of performing well in low light. Otherwise, just pass this one by and look at some of the other offerings by Canon and Sigma."
4,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens,"For the price, (a bit long on the CCA sensor, it looks like a 80mm) it does the job. Next choice would be the $300.00 1.2 50mm lens. But I really don't need IS, USM, etc. I would like a 1.2 50mm manual prime lens instead."
5,love this lens for a shot in the dark,Used thislens in a place that did not allowe flash and the pictures still came out awesome. Great lens for the price.
5,worth the money!,"i originally wanted to upgrade from my standard 18-55 zoom lens for my rebel t1i. i was going to get one with more zoom, but didnt really have the money yet. i also needed a new lens to take some portraits for my cousins senior photos. so my friend suggested this lens to me. it was for a really good price compared to most other zoom lenses. my cousins senior pictures turned out to be a great success because of this lens. i love the depth of field that it gives me! it pulls in a lot of light and the pictures are more vivid in color. the only thing i dont like about the lens is that it is made of a lot of plastic, which durability is a big thing for me. other than that i have to recommend this lens to anyone who wants to upgrade from a standard kit lens. ""nifty fifty"" is a must have in your inventory of gear!"
5,"You get what you pay for, plus so much more!","The Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 is the best lens in its price range. Usually when you buy a lower end lens you sacrifice build quality and optics for the function of the lens. Example. The Canon 75-300 f/4 II will get you the zoom you need but fails to deliver sharp images when zoomed in, because of lower quality optics. With the Canon 50mm f/1.8 you do sacrifice build quality, however, it's optical performance and ability to have a depth of field as shallow as f/1.8 makes up for its plastic, toy like construction. As well, who can argue its quality when it's only a $100? I have had this lens for a couple years now and have been completely satisfied with the pictures it can take since day one. For its price, in my opinion, you can't go wrong with this lens regardless what type of photographer you are."
5,A++,"I'll be honest, I didn't expect very much when I purchased this lens. The price was too affordable! Boy, was I wrong. I have quickly fallen in love with the quality of the lens. It's build is quite light but being a bit rough with my equipment, I have yet to have any issues... and at this price, I would not hesitate to purchase this lens again if something were to happen to it. Absolutely recommended you purchase this! If you're interested in seeing some of the shots it produces, check out my flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/heeyyitsla"
3,Broken within Two Weeks,"As others have stated, this lens will yield very nice, sharp images. If you buy it, make sure you also get a lens hood for outdoor shooting; otherwise, expect all of your pictures to have lens flares.Unfortunately, I dropped my lens less than 2 weeks after receiving it. The drop was only 2 feet onto not-so-plush carpeting; but, it was enough force to crack the casing in half. It is a bit sad that the glass on this lens is stronger than the plastic casing ""protecting"" it. Fortunately, American Express' insurance company is covering the damage. I definitely recommend buying this with a credit card so you too can get that 90 day coverage. More so, I recommend finding something a bit more sturdy even if it is a bit more expensive."
4,Not intended for dSLR small-format cameras,"While this is an excellent lens, if you're planning to use it with a small-format dSLR camera such as the Digital Rebel XSi be aware that it is designed for full-format 35mm. On the XSi it is equivalent to a 80mm lens with significantly smaller field of view. Don't forget the 1.6x multiplier (like I did)."
3,It's OK,"As an ametuer in the photography I bought this lense to start out and love how it takes indoor and outdoor pictures. However trying it out at night shooting a picture to the moon a notice a spot on the lense and thought it was dust??? however nothing when shooting this showed a blue dot which I have only seen when taking when I shoot to the moon, haven't tried it on the sunrise or sunsents. It don't show up all the time. So I believe it must be a lens flare? Maybe I will have to buy a hood?That's why I gave it three stars which is a lot, but the lense cost me less than $100 so it's OK."
2,You get what you pay for,"I am not 100% happy with this lens. It is cheaply made and does not do a good job of focusing. I used to have an older 50mm f/1.8 and I sold it. I will never sell older lenses again. They are made ten times better than the lenses they are selling today.This lens does the job for the most part, but I would not recommend it or purchase it again."
4,Out of the box goodness,"Easy to use, right out of the box.I've been using it consistently for 3 weeks. Yesterday I noticed that it wasn't registering bright light situations as well as some of my other lenses, but it responds well to low light. A distance of 2-3' seems to be its sweet spot. This is definitely worth the price."
3,Great Lens... Bad Copy?,"I love the crispness of this lens, I love how it saves my hide in low light. When it does. I have had my Rebel XTi for almost a year now, and shot almost 5000 images with it. I never once have experienced ERROR 99, till the first day I used this 50mm lens. Second time I went to use it on the shooting assignment - the same thing happened. I would work for a while, and then go into ERR99 freeze, I would have to turn the camera off, then back on to get few more shots, till it happens again. Does not happen when other lenses I own are used. I might update, when I find out more about whets going on..."
4,An excellent lens,This lens takes amazing portraits. It is also great for low light situations. I have owned it several months now and am very pleased with the results the lens produces. I have some great photos of my daughter that I will frame and be looking at for the rest of my life. Auto-focus seems really difficult when setting the f stop to a low number. I often use the manual focus for these conditions.
4,Perfectly pleased with this purchase,After being sorely disappointed with our family photos I decided I can take better shots myself!!! I bought this lens and was right! This lens is great for a beginner photographer who doesn't want to spend a ton of money but wants great shots.Build quality could be better (I'm sure if I ever drop it it'll be toast) but that's probably why it's so affordable. Definitely worth the cost
1,You get what you pay for,I purchased this as an addition for my d40 equipment. I returned it the next day. The price should have been a tip off. It hunted in low light about 80% of the time and 20% in good light. It miss focused badly in more than have the 50 test exposures I took. The build quality is definitely Canon's low end; feeling very plastic. It was also surprisingly noisy for such a small lens. I'll stick with the higher end Canon lenses like the 24-105L (which I love!)
4,"Cheap lens, but great when used right.","At around $80 to get a f1.8 lens is just great and on top of that this lens can produce some great images. Now the quality of this lens isn't close to other Canon lenses, this is cheaply made and feels almost like a toy. On a nice DSLR this lens looks comically small, however if you stop it down a bit, you can end up with some sharply focused images and still have some great background blur. Because I have the 85mm 1.8 I rarely use this lens, but am still glad I got it for when 85mm is actually too much magnification. Worth picking up if portraits or possibly product photography interests you."
4,it's a keeper,"No it's not CANON glass, but you're paying less than $100 for a decent CANON lens. Would I use it for my $$$$ clients, of course not; would I use it in a pinch when I need it's speed and focal length, sure! I don't always have access to the 50 f/1.2, or f/1.4 for that matter; in those instances, I think I can fake well enough with this one...lol. Go ahead and get it, and KEH is one the koolest (best) places to get stuff."
5,Great lens for great price!,"Great fixed zoom lens! Blows out the stuff behind your focus if you are close enough. I still need to do some adjusting, I'm still learning. But when you get a good shot, it's really is a GOOD shot! Wish I could zoom in and out more, but that means a lot more expensive of a lens. So for the price, you can get some great pictures! I'm happy with it!"
5,Love the new lense,"I have just started using the new lens, but I love it. I take a lot of sports photos in gyms and and quality has been very good."
5,50MM 1.8 Thrifty Fifty,I love love love this lens. For under $100 it can't be beat. The bokeh is AWESOME. The sharpness is AMAZING.
5,Amazing,"Wow ! I read all the positive reviews and took into account that this lens is a noisy ( which it is), but the photos are wonderful, so clear, and sharp. It is very light and plasticky as others have said, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it , especially to newer photographers. The difference between this Nifty Fifty and tHe kit lens is unbelievable. Everyone should have one one in their bag!"
5,The fantastic plastic...,"An f/1.8 canon lens for less than $100. First off it's not an ""L"" series lens. Once you've gotten past that you really can't complain too much about this lens. It is sharp and fast. Give it the opportunity and it will get you good/great images. I've had mine for close to two years and I'm still very happy with it and use it frequently."
5,Básico e obrigatório,"Simples, com poucos elementos óticos e qualidade de imagem excelente! Acho que todo fotógrafo tinha que ter uma dessas. A 1.4 deve ser perfeita!"
4,Awesome lens!!,"I received my lens about two days ago and haven't put it down since. The image quality is very sharp, but the built is a little on the downside. Since it's plastic, I am always afraid that I might break it.All in all, it is a great lens for a great price, as long as you're not too rough with it then you should be fine. I would very much recommend it."
4,It was Grey Market,The lens is fine but the fact that it was grey market was not mentioned in the vendors description (not Amazon). F1.8 adds a new dimension to photography. This lens allows exploring the pluses and minuses of a prime lens at a low cost.
2,"Awesome for 2 months, now blurry","I have hardly used this lens and abused it in no way. After 2 months it's no good to me because I can't get a sharp picture out of it. The AF is way off. If I manually focus I can come close, but no cigar. All my other lenses are awesome so I know its not the cameras fault."
5,My Go-To Portrait Lens,For the price of this lens you can't go wrong. Picture quality is great. Its made of plastic but shouldn't but too much of a big deal for most people I'm sure. This is apurchase I won't regret.
4,Excellent lens for the money.,For 70 bucks you really cant beat this lens even if it was to break after 6 months it would still be money well spent for the shots I got.
5,"Insane Quality, Low Price, Everyone should own one","I am a college student and an emerging photographer, which is a terrible combination. As many of you know photography can be an expensive hobby/art and college prices are rising. So what to do? Research lenses, save up money, and hope you aren't disappointed.This lens did not disappoint. I was skeptical at first thinking that an inexpensive lens would mean terrible quality, unreliable build, and overall crappy pictures. BUT, on the advice of a friend I spent the small amount. I haven't taken the lens off my camera since. You will not find a higher clarity lens for this amount of money. I recommend it to everyone. This lens will always hold a special place in my heart because with it I discovered what the art of photography really is. Unfortunately now I am looking for a zoom lens with the same quality (I have been spoiled with this one) and the prices are outrageous. So buy the 50mm. Everyone should own one."
3,Cheap Performance,"This lens has an attractive price. It is light weight and performs ok. If the available light is good enough, or I am using strobes I would prefer to use the EF 17-40 f4. If I find myself needing a fast 50mm I'll look at the EF 50 f1.4 or EF 50 f1.2. Those last lenses are a little more pricey, so this lens has its place for sure."
5,love this lens,love this lens. taking great pictures so far. would recommend and by again for my canon xti
4,Incredible Deal - Will fall apart after a while,"I bought my first one of these in 2000...and my second just bit the dust. Both fell completely apart, but I still spent less than I would have for the 1.4, and the quality of these lenses is fantastic. And at this price there is no good reason not to get this lens for your canon SLR. I have found most canon non-L primes are not as good as this, even the nice metal higher end ones.My most recent one broke after falling four feet off a shelf, a hard test for any lens. But most lenses cost a lot more to replace. You will not be disappointed by this lens."
3,"Definite bang for the buck, but a little loud for me","I spent hours and hours debating whether to buy the 1.8 or the 1.4 50mm prime. In the end, my pocketbook won over and I opted for the 1.8. As others have said, it is definitely a GREAT VALUE with excellent (as far as my amateur eyes can tell) image quality.That said, I am returning this lens basically just because it is loud. For most intents and purposes, it's probably not that big of a deal, but I bought the lens hoping I could take some nice pictures at a friend's indoor wedding, and just think the noise made from focusing will be unacceptable in a quiet church. $250 *is* a lot of extra dough to drop on the 1.4 just because of the noise, but I'm hopeful some of the other qualities of the lens will make it worthwhile as well."
2,"super value, but incredibly fragile","I bought a Canon 400D (XTi) with the kit lens in October. This lens was my first addition to my kit. For portraits, it's super. You can snap away indoors without a flash because it's so fast. The narrow depth of field also makes for some super outdoor shots. And if you stop it down some, it's super sharp.Overall, just a great performer.[Later edit]My review above was published soon after purchasing this lens. I stand by my thoughts on the performance of the lens. It's awesome. However, the lens is so incredibly fragile that I have broken two of them (I dropped one, so I don't hold that against Canon). My second version of the lens broke through normal use. I think they made this lens out of tissue paper. I will be replacing the lens with something more expensive, but sturdier."
5,A dream come true,"I'm taking some of the best photos I ever had and its all thanks to this lens. And for this price, I just can't believe it. Thanks to everyone who reviewed before me, it's changing my life."
4,Hanson has grown...This Time Around,"Although, still holding on to their teeny-bopper image and style, their sound is becoming more mature. Voices have changed, melodies have become more complex, but they still hold on to their brotherly harmonies that made their sound on their first couple albums. Jonny Lang's performance is hidden because of the nature of Hanson's music, but a nice listen-to, anyways."
3,"WITH 50CENT AND KANYE ITS.... ""DEAD EVEN'"" HITS","yes i admit i did ran out and bought both albumskanye has maybe 5 good repeatable hits and 8 garbage50 had 5 good hits 4(possibly)the rest garbage andfor the record i put the highlights from both on cdand put it in the ride. both were dead even on hits andgarbage tracks 50 could had did a better job on productionas well as kanye? get back to the lab and do that what you do bestyou gettin lazy mr. west,mr west oh i wasnt that impressed!you still my guy though at the record store!"
5,Another Mona Lisa,"I mean I loved it and even the two songs that I dislike are still meaningful. Of course I am some what bias because I love Kayne and were both from Chicago. But overall it is a great cd, my favorites being Everything I am, Flashing lights, and Homecomming. Definately got the support and it deserves."
1,Tasteless,Very tasteful of Mr. West to release his work on 9/11. I hope no one every tries to capitalize on his misfortune someday.
3,Kanye finally graduates! Representing for the strong blacks out there! 3.25 stars.,"The highlights on this rap, soul and rock-inspired record are:Good MorningStrongerEverything I AmHomecoming (Feat. Chris Martin)Flashing LightsThe lackluster tracks aren't too ample:ChampionDrunk & Hot GirlsHe's the one of the better Pop Rappers that I can think of. Three are better and come to mind when I think of Kanye Omari West: Jay-Z, Nas and Biggie. But that's it.To be *perfectly honest* thought this is Kanye's WEAKEST effort by far. Some of the songs are awesome such as Flashing Lights and Stronger but the crappy ones are *really* that - crappy. I've never been so disappointed in Him! I have already got a copy off of the internet and see next to no reason to cop this at all! Don't slip on Us anymore Kanye Omari!!! We've got *too* much Love and respect for You!3.25 stars."
1,smart marketer/producer NOT a rapper!,"Kanye West is a producer who knows how to create buzz and a few pop singles. I had low expectations, and was still severly disapointed. The cd was supposed to be a fun gift for my friend. Instead it was a waste and a crappy gift. We skipped through at least half the tracks on the first listen because the beats were either cheesy or weak. Later listenings confirmed the first impressions. Download his singles and save yourself some time and money. Or better yet, pick up Talib Kweli's new joint."
2,Get back to School Kanye,"I have always enjoyed Kanye West. Since hip-hop has strayed away from relevant lyricists Kanye was like a breath of fresh air. When College Drop Out and Late Registration dropped it reminded me of hip hop legends like Del the Funky Homosapien and The Pharcyde. His delivery has never been that great, but his beats were always on point and there was definite substance to his rhymes. So when Graduation came out I picked it up as soon as possible. And while his production skills are still at the top of the game, Kanye has succumbed to the hip hop mentality of braggadocios rhymes. The heart just isn't in it anymore. We always knew that Kanye was his own #1 fan, but now that's all he is. He's saying a lot without saying anything at all."
2,This was an awful album,"I was never a big Kanye West fan, but once I heard his hit song ""STRONGER"", I thought it that the album would be awesome. The music all sounded the same. I don't know how his album is beating out 50 Cents' album. People gave this him to much hype. I strongly encourage you to not buy this album. Go out there and purchase 50 Cents' album."
5,Kanye Is Back!!!!,"Kanye is back and as spectacular as ever!! I would not consider myself a Kanye West fan in particular, but he has gained my respect as an artist after putting out this stellar cd. Some tracks to check out are:Track 3- Stronger: The smash-hit debut single sets the tone for the whole CD. It flows, it's catchy, and it's a unique spin on hip-hop.Track 9- Flashing Lights: Awesome single that has on a techno-like beat, combined with Kanye's smooth lyrics. The song is flat-out stylish.Track 5- Good Life: Great feel-good, upbeat single that will probably be Kanye's second single off the CD. T-Pain is EXCELLENT on this track.Track 2- Champion: This track has classic Kanye style. Another great hit."
3,Decent Effort,"I don't know what it is, but Graduation just doesn't have the same effect as Kanye's previous two efforts. It might have to do with the fact that while the other two had Kanye talking about things that people can actually feel and relate to, most of this album is nonstop ego. I mean, mcs have always had a swagger to them, but at least they had the rhymes to back it up (ie. Rakim). This album's not bad, but it's definitely not as good as his first two. And it's definitely not the best of 2007. O yeah, and Mos Def needs to start rapping again instead of singing in every track. And Kanye needs to collaborate with better artists than T-Pain and Lil Wayne (horrible voice and lyrics). Actually, maybe that's why I didn't like this album as much.Favorite Track: Flashing Lights"
4,A Perfect Commencement....,"Kanye West has always been known for going against the grain of others in the Rap Industry. ""Graduation"" seems to solitify him as one of the best for innovation lyrically and productions. Each beat are deeper, darker & bass pounding besides tracks like ""Good Life (ft. T-Pain)"" & ""Homecoming (ft. Chris Martin)"". Each track has its positive strong points with good lyrical craft from Mr. West. The feature artist on the album are not exactly rapping but more crooning on the hooks from Dwele, Mos-Def, Chris Martin & T-Pain; this allows Kanye to venture into the world of the unknown. The most shocking track on the whole album is ""Big Brother"", which he dedicates his whole career to his ""brother"" Jay Z; the beat is sick also.Overall, the ablum is strong regardless it is only thirteen tracks on the album. But, each track is strong and supberb and carries the album to platinum status."
1,complete trash.,This guys is one of the lamest rappers out there. His flow is weak set to mediocore beats and he comments on social issues he knows nothing about. The only rapper i can think of thats as bad is Benzino. Don't waste your money theres better things you could be buying.... like toilet paper.
5,Mister K. West has reached the limit of graduating,"This deserves much credibility and alot of honor not since Kanye's mom Dr. Donda West passed (RIP), while listening to this album and following the previous two CDs that been grammy-certified, I felt this was it this time no interludes, no surprises. All we need is the music. He'll lead you thru getting ""Stronger"" and following and living ""The Good Life"", hitting more home runs as ""Barry Bonds"" and to the reach of being a ""Big Brother"". Every song is still Qualified Genius-ology. No where compared or matched. The album will lead you thru the journey of them all: John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Aretha, Michael Jackson, Duke Ellington, James Brown, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain, Tupac, Earth Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone, Boz Scaggs, and thru the use of film and tv score work of Henry Mancini, James Horner, John Williams, Ennio Morricone, Lalo Schifrin, Georgio Moroder."
4,"Great album, definetly Kanye's best so far...","Very nice album. It isn't like College Dropout, which is a future classic, sort of like Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. Kanye has a different swagger on this album, and the production is great. The whole album is like an experiment, but it worked out better than Late Registration, his sophomore album. All the tracks were amazing, probably except Barry Bonds, featuring Lil Wayne. Drunk and Hot Girls is also not as great, but I'm growing on it and the sample is getting to me.Hot album, definetly worth buying."
5,Kanye is the best!!,"Great album but not better than the two others!! Flashing lights, homecoming, Champion ,Good life are very Good.Congratulations for him.This is a real G.O.O.D music. Peace from France"
4,Graduation grabs you for awhile,"Graduation is the third album in Kanye West's discography. Once you listen to this album, you'll be catching yourself dragging back to it everytime you turn on your MP3 Player/Computer/Car stereo. Graduation has a lot of what we need in Hip Hop right now. Kanye isn't a full fledged MC like say Nas or Jay but he's close to it in the category of ""rapper"". Graduation has a large category of beats that will leave you memorized. The lyrical contains isn't as heart pounding as his last solo project ""Late Registration"" but it dosen't tag behind too much of a distance. Songs like ""Flashing Lights"", ""I Wonder"" and ""Big Brother are what make the album sound so great. If you liked Kanye's past efforts then this one is defiantly worth a listen."
2,"Hmm................well, not quite Oscar's best","Yes, I like Oscar Lopez. No I do not like this particular CD of his. It is way too bland, too much towards the soft-jazz genre instead of nuevo flamenco. Look at his album Flashback. There is a reason that NONE of the tracks on this cd appear on that album. Buy Flashback instead and you'll be very happy with your purchase. These other reviewers must like bland, middle-of-the-road soft jazz. There is no kick or passion to this album. Sometimes it happens when you have to produce just to produce. This isn't from his soul, there is it a decent album for background music."
3,Cute but sizing is a bit off,"I loved how they looked and felt that the material of the stockings was good. But I'm 5'6 and still felt that these were too short, and now wish I'd gotten the larger size. I think as a woman of average height, these should have fit very well, and can only imagine how taller women must feel."
2,not so good,Not a lot of traditional gospel songs--and the arrangements were too fast paced--like hyped-up blue grass musicians--poor song selection flow--lack of coherence--not recommended.
3,Fresh & Moody music with depressing lyrics,"I particulary like the style of the guitar playing in this CD. It is original and fresh. With the exception of track 4, which doesn't do much for me, I enjoy the music. The lyrics tell about the dark side of the world, which isn't my cup of tea. My first impression was negative due to the lack of melody in the vocals. It distracted me from the listening to the music. It sounded more like a narrative drone which doesn't suit my taste. It didn't take long for me to overcome this and to appreciate his style. I intend to keep it in my car CD player for a while because the music is fresh and does create a mellow mood that rocks."
5,Genius; Inspector Morse at His Best,"Fascinating episode. I think if you like Inspector Morse at all, you will like this one."
5,Lives up to its name,"For those unfamiliar, the organ here is the largest in America and has a range of color, style, and volume unmatched. Most of the pieces on the recording are excellent, showing the variety of what this magnificent instrument can do. One thing that is easy to under-appreciated in the other review is that the performer himself transcribed the orchestral selections for the organ. You will not be able to find these arrangements for organ anywhere else."
3,Not bad,"I would think most people who would buy this CD would get more to hear the organ itself than the tracks contained in it. The organ sounds grand in a rich acoustical space. Lots of color.Night on Bald Mountain is by far the best track of the album. The Sorcerer's Apprentice is played much slower than most people are use to hearing. Everything else is rather forgettable.Here, it's the organ that shines not really the performer."
1,A SERIOUS WASTE OF TIME! OMG!,"I can't believe this is selling for $21.99?!?! umm me and a friend got this from RedBox last night...in mood for a holiday movie, and this was our only option. Barely any Chritmas-ness in it at all, but omg there are no words to describe how horrible and dragged out this movie was. Such a waste of time, I felt like the movie lasted a week, I dozed off a few times. I want my dollar back."
2,Replacement Parts Not Available,Initially this product was great. Food was hot 12 hours later. After only a few months of daily use I noticed that the food wasn't as warm. The problem lies in the silicon rubber gasket on the stopper. It stretches and no longer seals properly allowing leakage and temperature issues. Eventually the gasket starting falling off into my food. After simply placing the gasket back on for a while it tore. The gasket is not available as a replacement part nor is the stopper with gasket available although for other models they do. This happened with two different bottles. I've now given up and am trying a different type. If Stanley had stood behind it with replacement parts then perhaps I'd feel differently about it.
3,Not bad for middle school,"Plenty of historical information, the reenactments aren't too hokey, and there is just enough (implied) sex and war to keep teenagers interested. I ordered three docus about ancient china, and this was definitely the best of the three. but that's not saying much for the others."
3,No bells..no whistles!,"ONE PINK ROSE: A sweet story of Travis Clayborne finding his Bride. Cut and dried..game over, but told well. Best of the three stories.ONE WHITE ROSE: Fast paced story told without hooplah. It could've been so much better!!! Second best of the three stories.ONE RED ROSE: Are you frikkin' kiddin' me??? Seriously?? Poor excuse for a plot...Genevieves' character pathetically underdeveloped. Some mystery, little intrigue and if it weren't for the epilogue there'd be absolutely NO romance to this story. Attraction, yes...romance, no! Such a tragic flop!!Too bad each of these brothers didn't qualify for their own well laid out story in complete book form."
2,The Clayborne Brides,Not up to scratch from Julie Garwood. It had potential but too short a story on each couple to fully develop the characters and the same MO too!
5,Julie Garwood is a genious,"Her books are awsome! She is one of the top romance writter in my book I have read 17 of Julie Garwood's novels and she astounds me every time I read a new one. I suggest if you want to read this book start with the book ""For the Roses"" then go onto read ""One Pink Rose"", ""One white Rose"", and ""One Red Rose"" and then read ""Come the Spring"" These books are all about the Claybourne family and how they strived to survive raising an abandoned baby that they found in New York and turning her into a lady. After their little Mary Rose is grown up and Married to a highland Lawyer named Harrison each brother is tempted by women into settling down will the brothers run or face the destiny that MAMA Rose tricks them into."
3,Good product..while it lasted,"I liked it: it looked good and worked well. But after 14 months -- a time reported by some other reviewers -- it started leaking. So for the price, this kettle will cost you about 5 cents a day before you throw it away."
4,A nice electric kettle,"I had this kettle for about a month and have been very satisfied with it. I use it at work, and have it right on my desk. No smells, it's quick, takes up very little space, and is fairly atractive.I gave it four, rather than five, stars because it's a little larger than I'd like, I would have perfered all stainless steel, and the cord is about 2"" too short to reach a power strip on the floor when placed on a typical desk."
1,On switch doesn't work,On switch will not stay down to turn on the machine. Must repeatedly press/hold down to eventually get it to work. Not sure if it is a fluke or systemic problem of this product. Apparently past versions have also had this problem.
2,Leakage problem,We loved our Braun electric kettle and used it several times a day. However it is now leaking water all over the counter. It worked absolutely great for almost one year and we would have highly recommended this product until now.
4,"Excellently designed, but still not quite right","This electric kettle is designed very well. It is quick, efficient, and safe. Its construction is convenient and aesthetically attractive. However, for the first 25 uses or so, it left my water (or tea) with a slight plastic taste that wasn't terribly appealing. It took quite a while for that to cease, but now it works fine, and I am pleased with it."
1,"great kettle, but ours developed a leak","This is probably the best kettle I've used (out of maybe four in various countries). It heats water quickly, pours extremely well, is ergonomically designed, and is a pleasure to use, honestly. Our kettle, however, developed a leak at the bottom seal, ranging from a slow to fast drip. Braun no longer services these, so we have to send it in for a simple refund (at our expense). I would definitely considering buying another, however."
5,Simply perfect and groovy,Perfect real and 100% live jazz session by some master's in business... Just perfect!
4,Not quite as good as good as the first but still cool,"This compilation is more electronic than the first one - some of the songs are excellent but overall, I didn't like as many of the tracks on this one as the first one. Still cool though."
2,Cute and Fun But Shallow,"The layout is well done. The image choices and arrangement demonstrate the ever changing womans form. There's not much hope of a book this small being deeply informative on such a broad span of history. But it is always disappointing when another book perpetuates the myth that steel corsets were common practice, and ribs being removed was equally plausible. The text history is anecdotal and amusing, much in the same way that a magazine would cover an entire century of fashion on one page, and make it interesting. This is a cute little coffee table book for parties. Would be fun at a sex toy party, or lingerie party, where the theme would get people in the mood to buy."
3,Not his best work,"Great story, but I'm not sure what was going on w/ David Robbins when he wrote this book, it was like he was trying too hard - it seemed like he was making up descriptive words, or using lots of descriptive words that seemed out of place. I did't get that feeling at all when reading War of the Rats.Waited quite a while for the book from the Amazon reseller; it arrived within their 3-week window, but it still took too long in my opinion."
1,QS120F,I have a Q-See QSOCWC camera that came with a 60' cable but needed to extend the length. After adding the 120' extension I got nothing from the camera but white lines and total blanking of the video and no audio. After using just the 120' cable I got the same thing.
2,Only works when I *don't* connect the power.,"Not sure what to say. I can only use the video and audio cables. When I connect the power, I get no signal on the other end. The power cable either has too much loss or creates too much noise. Either way, its not useful for both power and video.I brought the power up with other means to the camera and it works fine as a carrier for video/audio. Just not together."
5,Eye Opener 2 Real Life In The Streets,"I saw this movie back in 1992 and several times after that, this movie will capture you and intrigue you. While I would not recommend this movie to the younger crowds, it is definately an eye opener. To think that Eddie Olmos received threats for making this movie from the EME, it's crazy. It really shows you life in the streets and behind prison.Saddly several people were killed after the complition of this movie, for having ties with it. A lot of knowledge went into producing this movie and to give a realistic scene and life in the barrio.A must to own and a must to have. Eddie Olmos really got recognized for his work after this movie.Get it."
3,Not the strongest in the series of Doctor Who Guides.,"Monsters is probably the weakest of David J. Howe's books. After such entries as ""Time Frame"", ""The Eighties"" and ""Companions"" this book falls flat. I didn't feel there was alot of information given about the monsters and the pictures chosen were less than tantilizing for me to enjoy it as a whole. Whereas his previous books which were filled with gorgeous pictures and tid bits of obscure information that keeps you interested thoughout the whole book. This one however gives me the feeling, ""Ho Hum, that was nice."" after I'm through reading it. It seems like this book was published in a hurry just to get another Doctor Who book on the shelves. It seems like every aspect of Doctor Who has been run dry and now they're just grasping for ideas. I certainly hope that this is not the case because it would be a real shame for someone as insightful as David J. Howe to ends a very successful series of books like this."
4,"great film, commentary leaves something to be desired","Norman Jewison is one of the most rambling directors ever. His commentary is so annoying that I had to turn it off halfway through. Most of the time he isn't even talking about what's going on on the screen--he's talking about other films he's done, etc. Topol's commentary becomes the same way after a while--he starts talking about his career and forgets to talk about Fiddler. Between the two of them and their redundant commentaries, it's hardly worth buying the special edition. The regular (less expensive) version will do just fine."
2,Bait & Switch,"DON'T DEAL WITH THESE FOLKS....ARCHIE-BBUNKER......I ordered a DVD of Fiddler on the Roof ""Collector's Edition"" (a two disk set) not once, but TWICE through Amazon from a company called Archie-bbunker. BOTH times they sent me a LESS expensive Fiddler on the Roof ""Anniversary Edition"" (a one disk set). Now I do not have what I wanted & have paid a LOT more money to have it!!!!"
5,Fiddler on the Roof!,"Outstanding film! Its 3 hrs long but it will keep you glued to it! Sadly it is a PAL film so I had to watch it on my computer but it was fantastic! Yes, Im getting a pair of external speakers for my computer! Its worth it, I can watch any disc on my computer and keep the volume down so our kids can sleep!"
5,Excellent!,"Everything about this movie, one of my long-time favorites, is quality - script, actors, sets, score. The special features on the DVD let us see into the making of it and the pains that were taken to make Fiddler on the Roof the wonderful production it is. Even if you think you don't like musicals, you would probably like this; it has comedy, drama, tragedy, lovable charaters, and great music."
3,Possible audio problem?,"I had gotten this bluray version for a friend of mine who adored this film. He was so excited to get it. When asking him how it looked he told me the picture looked awesome, the audio, to quote, ""Left something to be desired. I had to turn it up quite a bit to hear anything."" Is anyone else experiencing this?"
5,Timeless Classic.,"Always been one of my favorite plays for the music and the story. This is in my opinion the best DVD rendition of it out there. If you love the story, get it!"
5,I Never Tire of This Movie or Music,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I have watched it so many times. I'm really happy to finally own it myself. No one could match the performance of Topol--I love to hear the music over and over. The story is timeless. The scenery is fantastic. What else can I say?Important note for overseas viewers: I am in Morocco, and have multisystem machines, which include NTSC. However, when I ordered this DVD, I discovered that my machine must only contain the CANADIAN version of NTSC, which is a lower number than the U.S. version. So it only plays in black and white on my television. Before your DVD player (or video player, if you order that version) has the 4.43 NTSC. This is a movie that is REALLY important to see in color, or you miss all the details in the scenery."
4,A wonderful film by talented young film makers,"Smuggler's Ransom is written, directed, and produced with a passion not only for creating a finely-crafted Christian film, but in presenting both a strong, plausible story, and God's life-changing message of hope and love. The actors deliver excellent performances that serve the story well. Anthony Tyler Quinn stands out depicting his struggles between what he does, and ultimately, who he is. This film would have benefited greatly from a larger budget as the directors would have been able to develop the characters' back stories more. Even so, with the story ""cutting to the chase"", the plot holds together and the message of God's love for each of us, no matter what we think we are, is loud and clear. A great effort from a film-making team certain to be noticed in this genre."
4,Midnight in the Grand Court,"For organ enthusiasts, this is a wonderful CD. To hear this King of Instruments in it's full ""romantic"" splendor is fantastic. The only way it could be better is to hear the Wanamaker in person!"
4,Great notes...no notes,"The late great Gary Moore was a rock guitarist than a blues guitarist, hence I'd say this CD is more rock/blues. I think he's underrated as a singer but there is no underestimating his guitar playing abilities -- they are first rate. He can play lightening quick but also knows how to milk some fine tones out of his guitar. If you like Walter Trout, you'll like this one too."
3,Good but too heavy blues,"I admire Gary Moore and I like this CD. I find his songs very clever pastiches of Texas blues, EC/Bluesbreakers, Peter Green, slide and Chicago blues rather appealing. But, I don't think he really has the blues in the sense that give him half the chance he turns the Marshall up to 11 and plays like a heavy metal god - it is a little tiring on the ears. But, as his interpretations of what got him into playing the guitar in the first place this is a good recording. He just needs to calm down a little and take it slower. Still - he certainly can play!"
5,still got the blues,"i got this album out after not having played it for awhile .I still can't get enough of ""still got the blues"" .I find it to be just an amazing piece of music ,that can give you chills just listening to it"
3,Make Your Move,"I first heard of Eiffel in a club in Paris. With little more memory than of their name, I bought the CD. It's what you expect and perhaps a little more. Nice dance beat, good rhythm and keeps the energy at a good level. I would like to hear a little more sophisticated music in the future from Eiffel."
4,A Cook's Tour I'd Like To Go On...,"I'm a huge fan of Travel Channel's ""No Reservations,"" and this in depth look at the initial trips that gave rise to the franchise did not disappoint. The writing is tight and funny, and I always appreciate Mr. Bourdain's respect for other cultures. A fun read, and inspirational to expanding the reader's palette. Plan to get hungry!"
5,"A rollicking journey through food, culture and politics","This book didn't only make me want to eat, it made me want to learn more about Henry Kissenger.Bourdain weaves the historical and political into his narrative to explain the whys and hows of the food (and, importantly, its quality and lack thereof) in the countries he visits. Compare and contrast his visits to Vietnam and Cambodia, both countries devastated by American geopolitical interests, whose histories have had definite impacts on their cuisine.He's a funny, scathing, moving writer - his love of food and travel enfuse his writing with a power rarely found in either cookbooks or travelogues."
2,Drop the Attitude,"After reading Kitchen Confidential and not being overly impressed, but somewhat entertained, I thought I'd give Bourdain another chance. Well, that was the last one. Sure, he can write, and vividly too, but that's not enough. The bitching, the drugs and the booze get tiring after the tenth ""adventure"". He spends way too much energy cultivating his renegade and rebellious stance, trying to convince the reader, it seems, that he's different, he's unconventional, he's not your average chef, and people who wear Lands' End clothes are morons. This wears thin and, ultimately, it's not about the food anymore, but about Anthony and his attitude. Grow up Anthony (or go back to the kitchen and forget about the Food Network)."
2,The wrong man for the job,"It's certainly an interesting idea - send a chef out to sample various exotic cuisines in search of the perfect combination of food, place, setting. But they picked the wrong guy.I cannot believe this man can taste food, much less be a professional chef. He is destroying his taste buds, through the abuse of alcohol and nicotine, not to mention myriad forms of cannabis and the occasional cocaine amuse-nez. His idea of a good time is to get so drunk he can't remember what he did, swear a lot, and in general behave like the kind of jerk you wouldn't want at the table next to you. I think he suffers from testosterone-poisoning."
1,AVOID IF YOU HAVE NEC 1300a,"It will not work on this drive. Period. I switched to Maxell and Fujifilm disks, and now I'm a happy camper."
1,Very unreliable,Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders. I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500 2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW & CD RW DISKS!!
1,HORRIBLE - but CONSISTENTLY horrible,"At least Memorex is consistent. I just got another box of these and the second box is just as crappy as the 1st. They should be ashamed of themselves from even attempting to sell this junk. These disks do not work. Period. New computers, old computers, burners, whatEVER... Memorex RW DVDs are absolute trash."
3,Solid Early Christie,"This is highly enjoyable and captures an important time in English history. The story keeps one in suspense (unlike some of Christie's other works) and includes several of the characters who appeared in ""The Secret of Chimneys."""
5,John Paul Jones - he deserves more respect,"JPJ is the most impressive member of Led Zeppelin these days. Page and Plant play old material in bad cover format and Bonzo sadly just doesn't play...Anywho this being said, Thunderthief is an amazing album that shows JPJ's true musicianship. There are a few Jam songs just like on Zooma but on Thundertheif Jones uses more acoustic, such as his 3 necked guitar and 3 necked mandolin. He also sings on a few titles and his voice isn't that bad.This CD goes out to musicians and zeppelin fans, but any music lover should enjoy this CD.CAH"
4,Jones' steps out from Zepplins shadow to deliver great disc!,"John Paul Jones, former bass player of Led Zepplin, delivers an outstanding disc of great rock instrumentals.There was never a question if the man could play bass, but listening to this disc you'll realize how underrated he was with the legendary rock band. He kicks.From the opening track Leafy Meadows with his driving bass lines and King Crimson legend Robert Fripp accompanying him on guitar the disc grabs you from the get go.I also enjoyed ""Hoediddle"", ""Daphne"" and ""Down to the River to Pray"" all exceptional instrumentals on this cd.I didn't particularly care for the tracks with Jones on vocals for instance the title track ""Thunderthief"" and ""Ice Fishing at Night""Give this one a listen. Hear one of the ""other"" Zepplin legends at his finest."
5,required reading for all,The book is not an easy read. I bought it because I wanted it so that I could pick it up anytime and mull over what our founding fathers were thinking and their reasoning behind forming a new country.
5,My German Shepard is doing better.,This product is working for my dog very well. She is has problems in her rear hips and these pills are definitely helping her. I will reorder when the time comes.
5,this stuff really works.,If you're going to dye your hair your going to need the 'Lo real Volume Developer Creme'.
1,rip off,"The kessinger edition of this book is a rip off!!! do not buy it!!!i received a copy in which the margins on the pages were 2 inches all around and the text was so small. everything seemed to be copied with a fax machine, so there was lots of tiny black dots all over the pages. the images are so unclear. they were black and white with no grayscales and it was so hard to make out what the images were. i returned this book for a refund.buy the dover edition instead. its practically the same text except the text fills up the whole page and the pictures are clear. its also less than half the price of the kessinger edition."
5,"Intricate, Suspenseful and Creative...","Working at the State Department, I'd heard about ""Savarona"" and decided to give it a read, wondering if the policy wonks I work with everyday could actually come up with a book I'd find entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they could. Vividly written, ""Savarona"" makes you feel like you're racing around Istanbul with its cast of off-kilter characters. It is intricately structured, witty and creative and had me on the edge of my seat multiple times, anxious to know what would happen next. Entertaining plot and characters aside, it educates with frank, sometimes critical, commentary on the Foreign Service and gives the reader a glimpse into the challenges these men and women face overseas every day. I'd recommend it to any one, and particularly to those interested in pursuing the Foreign Service. Let's hope Mr. Hart's future assignments allow him some time to write again!"
1,Not very happy,I purchased the book from Amazon.com and after about a month I called them because I had not received it. They informed me that the book was coming from another company who I then called. I had no luck reaching this other company by phone or email so I called back Amazon.com and they told I had to wait until a certain amount of days were up before they would reimburse me. Overall I was very unhappy with Amazon.com and will never buy from them again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Good giggles for cheap,"Born and raist in rural Georgia, I gots a hardy prishation for nermal talk - that is, speech what ain't been hardened by yankee winters and lack'uh manners. So I gets a chuckel er two outta much uh this here collection of Mistuh Nicholson's dry wits. Most folks aint gonna wanna pay full fair, on accounta the joke kinda tires after three er five pages. But if ya kin find yer a copy on the cheap, itta prolly make good bathroom readin. That's were I's keepin mine."
2,What a boring and loose read!!,"I found every chapter was dealing with limited infromation crawling at snail paces. I also found that all the intermediate chapters recruited Spenser's so-called sweetheart Susan were totally meaningless and could be deleted. I found the only small vice in this book was that Parker to waltz a very boring and trivial plot into a jumbo book by using totally pretentious, try-to-humor-me, totally unnecessary dialogues to balloon into a third rated novel. Parker is still under the hypotic effect of Raymond Chandler's lazy genre and still failed to come out it. The whole book is just a waste of time, even considered waste on the toilet. What a bore"
2,Spenser is old and Parker is tired,"What a sleeper. Being a Spenser fan is a bit like being a fan of The Who - no matter how worn the product, I rush out and consume it. But tried and true fans will surely be disappointed, as you likely were with Chance and Thin Air. The brilliance of Catskill Eagle is long dead, though it showed briefly in Walking Shadow. There are many of us who think it's time for Susan to die. That might breath some life back into the series. And it's time for co-eds to stop hitting on Spenser every time he walks into a bar. Some authors freeze their characters in time. Parker did not, and should recognize that a 60 year-old with several gunshot wounds, scar tissue on his eyes and a oft-broken nose is not the kind of guy that the buxom girl in the college bar wants to sleep with. This book was way too close to Valediction. Parker is running out of story lines. This book is for serious fans only, and even then I'm not so sure."
3,Dealing with Consequences?,"I like Robert Parker as an author. His stories are well told and highly entertaining. However, I find it hard to believe that Spenser, Hawk and even ultimately Susan can be involved in the killing of so many people and not be affected by this. Most crime novelists do not deal with the psychological pain that is involved with killing and the emotional scars that are left. These deaths ultimately, for me at least, make it impossible to suspend my disbelief and truly enjoy his books"
2,Not worth the money by any stretch of the imagination,"It completely not worth the $20 to $25 you would spend. Llewellyn's Witches Datebook is much more thorough, complete, and without mistakes. I have found mistakes in my Seasons of the Witch Day Planner and have been disappointed by the money I spent for the product I received."
2,There are many better books on probability,"A short book describing in non-technical terms some standard topics in mathematical probability -- e.g. gambler's ruin, coincidences, birthday problem, secretary problem. The writing style is reasonably clear and accurate. But this type of material has been covered in many other books with more breadth and flair, not to mention value for money. Read instead RosenthalStruck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities."
3,tablet is fine but the shipping/packaging is terrible,This is the exact tablet that I wanted and is perfect for what I had planned. However the packing was terrible. The tablets were FOLDED in half and stuffed into a flat box. Now I have 2 tablets with PERMANENT creases down the middle. This was the most unintelligent way to ship these products. No one wants a tablet that is folded and creased. They should be put into a FLAT box big enough for the tablets to lay flat or perhaps ROLLED but not folded.
5,Incredible!!! (San Francisco State University),"Este CD me ha dejado anonadado. Sus canciones son tan romanticas y aun mas con la bella voz de mi querida y favorita Rocio Durcal. La cancion que hasta me hace llorar cuanto estoy tomado es: ""Necesito."" Bellisima...todas."
4,Broader but not deeper,"I kept 3 editions of this important title. No doubt on its authoritativeness. This new 2001 edition caught my immediate attention when I first saw it. I browsed thru it nearly from cover to cover. There are some newer entries not listed before (the 1984 ed), e.g., tiramisu. However, information on other cuisines is brief, e.g., only 2 pages on Spanish cuisine. For a serious cook like me who own 100+ cookbooks, this title is not essential. But, if you haven't yet owned previous editions, this is not a bad idea."
1,What a Bunch of Bunk,Where did Mr. Spivey or any of us ever get the idea that God defends unrighteous livers? The whole concept is counter Biblical and bad doctrine.
1,Very Poor Quality.,"I was purchasing this for my daughter to keep at her new house, so I wouldn't have to haul all of my tools over there every time I went over to help her with a small project, but it was way too poorly made."
1,Not worth it even for the price,"Now I know this tool set seems pretty cheap but this set is pretty bad. First off don't be fool by the 160 pieces when there are only about 50 actual tool parts in the set(you really can't count the nails). ratchet is worthless, mine even came broken. All the tools clearly very poorly made. You would be better off either putting out the cash for a nice tool set which really will only run you $90 from Home Depot plus all tools have a life time warranty or just buying the tool you need. Just stay away from this tool set."
3,Home Repair Kit,Inexpensive commonly-used tools in a convenient kit. Would have been nicer if the screw driver handle could also be used to drive nuts with the sockets.
3,Interesting system,"I got this book to help study words for the GRE exam. It's definitely a more entertaining system than trying to memorize just definitions, however the formatting of this book is terrible on my kindle (not sure if that is just me or not), but tons of gaps and the further I got into the definitions the words/key/link sentence weren't even all on the same page which made it very distracting and hard to focus."
5,Stair Treads are nice,"I have three levels and ordered enough to do all of the step. Not only do they look good, they also save the carpet on the steps. They are very thick but does serve the purpose."
3,May be a trip hazard,These look good but are somewhat thin and wear out after a year or so. I had to buy double-sided carpet tape to secure them to the wood stairs. I needed them so the dogs could go up and down. I have since removed them after they wore out. The other negative is that you can possibly trip over the edge if not secured down well.
1,Bragging is not a Biography,"As a John Denver fan and an avid reader, I found this book to be nonsense.The writer(?)made her indiscretions and New Age beliefs sound as if she were destined to have a night of hot sex with a lonely musician/songwriter.The more ridiculous this story became, the faster I skimmed, looking for some redeeming value. But no such luck.If you can't turn away from watching a train wreck, read this book. But borrow it; don't waste your hard earned money to buy it."
5,Review From the Bomp Bookshelf,"""Jeannie St. Marie tells a very entertaining, poignant, and personal story - her real life experiences with John Denver. A must read for anyone desiring an inside look at the mega-star's intimate side. Jeannie's conversational and down-to-earth writing style makes you feel as if she's right in your own living room. Through her eyes, I've come to a new level of appreciation for John's beautiful musical works and his passionate spiritual service to our world. Many John Denver facts and reference sources are also included."" - A Reviewer from Bomp.com - the Bomp Bookshelf - the most complete catalog of music books online, listing and reviewing every music book ever published."
2,Keeping it intimate,"I think anyone who cared so much about John should have kept the intimate details just that, intimate, Isn't that what caring, loving and trust is all about. Sure it might be cool for your friends to know that you were intimate with John but was it really worth a few bucks to share what he probably thought was between you two. I guess I just see things different. Why now? What do you think Johns mother or any of his three children would think about reading your book, how would they feel. Would you and John still be friends if this had of been printed earlier. I think to me his friendship and trust would be more important. But good for you."
4,EXCELLENT,"It takes real guts to step out of the box...This cd was an adventure into other venues of music. I play sax, so I was interested in what Hill did on this cd. Its great ."
5,Be Prepared best baby book I've gotten,"I'm expecting my first child. People have been giving me all kinds of books to help me prepare. The problem with those books? BORING. And don't address a lot of the realistic problem you'll encounter. I bought this book for daddy to be because it looked fun, and those are the only kinds of books he likes. When it arrived, he and I actually paged through it with a friend, laughing at the pictures and enjoying the practical advise given.All in all, we've both read it front to cover now and we plan to give it to other friends that are expecting."
5,Wonderful for daddy and mommie,"My husband found this at a used bookstore and the book is excellent. The cover makes it look like it's an old book but it is updated and down to earth. We have bought this book for a couple of our friends that are expecting. It's humorous and really full of information.Funny parts..it mentions men saying ""so long to the breasts for a while"" because they belong to the baby. haha And even talks about changing a diaper at a football stadium."
4,Good and entertaining read for 1st time dad,"Bought this for my hubby while expecting our first child. He enjoyed it and read it much faster than the ""serious"" baby books. Now that our daughter is 3 months old, i can say that this book was the one he referred back to most when he had a question and he still goes back to it now. My best friend and his wife are expecting and I just bought this book for him too."
5,Husband Loves It!,"Bought this for husband after we found out we were pregnant. The format is a little tongue in cheek, but laced with practical advice. Definitely seems to come from a guy's perspective, so it's easy to connect to the material. My husband has enjoyed reading it and will be sharing it with another father to be soon."
4,Expecting Dad,"Great book, geared more toward after the little guy or girl is born, but some good stuff for ""dad prep"" leading up to the arrival also. Really good information and ideas for after the baby is born and definitely written for guys, I'd recommend it."
3,"Kindle version okay, Many typos, and not as much info as I thought.","This book is not too definitive, but makes for an easy to read reference for those that know very little. I have nine nieces and nephews and must have picked up a good deal of this information from watching them and from my siblings telling me what they were going through. I enjoyed the manly alternatives to usual stuff, duffle bag for diaper bag, how to organize it, and the six pack bottle holder. Other information like making emergency diapers and some baby proofing tips will be useful. I really liked this when first reading the book, but I cannot believe the editors and author did not catch the numerous misspellings and typos. That really detracts from an otherwise fun read."
3,Egh,"I'm expecting my first child, so I want to be prepared. This book was ok at first, funny with good info, but the further I got into it, the less and less interested I was. It almost seemed like the person got tired of writing it and just wanted to be finished, as did I."
3,Good book but I don't recommend it for Kindle,I first bought this book for the kindle and hated it. There are too many pictures that don't translate well digitally. I returned it and purchased the book and I'm happy with that. Good fun info for first time dads in a simple format that keep his attention.
1,don't work,"I use black sharpies all day in my job, but I needed ones that would be visible on black coaxial cable. In a 4 pack, not a single one of them worked as they were supposed to. You could barely see what I wrote with them. It should be a solid silver and I'd describe it more like transparent. Hopefully I just got a bad pack, but I'm not sure I wish to waste anymore money."
5,Photo booth guest book,I used these for my photo booth guest book. They wrote perfectly and looked amazing on the black scrapbook pages that my wedding guests wrote notes on next to their photo booth pics.
3,i waited 10 years to see how the show ended.,"I wished they did more with it but in the end I was disappointed and the finale left something to be desired. I wanted to see more alien characters and maybe a glimpse of the home world but got zilch. The one good thing about my experience was that I saw it for free using my brothers netflix. Not really worth buying, at least not to me. Mystery solved."
1,never got order,My cat loves this toy but its been 30 days and i still have not received it and so amazon cancelled my order. I am very upset with this company(not amazon) for never making contact or sending me this order.
1,completely worthless,"Just so you know... the picture shown with this item is not what was sent. This cataction thing I got is supposed to go over your door. Unfortunately, the plastic is too thick and the door won't shut after you put it up. I was slighltly concerned after seeing this that one of my feline friends might grab the mouse, pull, and subsequently bash him/herself in the head with an unsecured door! Fortunately, the mouse fell off after one day so I didn't have to worry about it. :("
4,GREAT MOVIE,IT IS A GOOD MOVIE. ENCOURAGE YOU AND GIVE YOU HOPE. GAO WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT HE TELL YOU. HE IS FAITHFUL.
5,Superb!,"Without a doubt the best movie Abraham you'll find. Richard Harris gives a masterful performance. Faithful to scripture, thankfully free from silly sentimentalism that so destroys true religion, and thoroughly Catholic. Highly recommended -- as are all the Turner (yes, surprisingly Ted's name is attached to the best dramatised OT series around -- no doubt to his everlasting chagrin!)."
2,does not toast evenly,With the cost of this toaster I thought it would at least toast evenly and it does not. The 4 slice is apparently a much better overall toaster (my relative has one). The 2 slice does not live up to description.
2,Didn't last very long,"This was a fine toaster while it worked, but IMHO it failed sooner than it should have.We are going with a less expensive toaster this time."
2,"Looks nice, doesn't last","We've had this toaster for about a year and a half now. The heating elements are starting to go - it never toasts consistently anymore. What's annoying is that we rarely even use it, maybe once or twice a week at most, so to have it breaking after so little time is really frustrating. This is the last time I pay extra for a ""pretty"" toaster."
4,Arkenstone's back! With WORDS!,"The new age artist adds words to his music! Aside from this striking difference between this and previous works, Arkenstone also mixes Middle Eastern music with African music and a little Asian influence as well into his own unique brand of jazzy new age music. This is as hard as it sounds, so does he do it well? Absolutely. The whole album has a sound that reminds the listener of John Tesh, but is more of a musical accomplishment than Tesh's work."
4,Great Book for Beginners and Intermediate Students,"This book is well-written and lavishly illustrated with good-quality color photographs from a number of well-known contemporary photographers. The basic physics of color theory and color perception are well laid out. The text and explanations are easy to follow, even for a novice. Having taught color photography for a number of years, in the US and in France and Italy, I have found that this text to be the most consistently useful for my students."
4,Great Shirt but..,Great ShirtI remember the original print being a little darker and the shirt is a little thin but its still cool.
1,a pulp fiction wannabe lousy movie,"lousy script, acting, filming, directing. terrible faded color. trying very hard to be a cool noir but falling too short about nine yards. totally impossible and unbelievable plot. the shooting is worse than most of other bad movies i've ever watched. there's nothing to tell but waste of your time and money."
5,Fantastic music and lyrics - exciting sound.,"If you're a fan, this album was worth the wait! There is lot of talent in this group. Every time I listen I hear something new. You must hear ""Haunt Pallenberg"". It's got great harmony and the drums at the end are fantastic."
4,"Manage organizational change, and quickly","The lessons Elspeth Murray and Peter Richardson wish to convey about organizational change are important, applicable and easy to sum up: If you want to change, do it quickly. The first 100 days are crucial. Build ""speed, critical mass and intelligent momentum."" Traditional models of decision making and strategic planning take too much time and contain far too many bottlenecks, making them inappropriate for the Information Age. The authors have done their research and they clearly explain the key elements of change and how to apply them to a range of situations. In fact, the authors do too good a job of emphasizing their main points: The book's drawback is its repetitiveness. We recommend that leaders who haven't yet managed a major change or those who wonder why their efforts have not succeeded read this book - especially the first half. Once you understand the core concepts, you may be able to read the rest less intently."
4,Britney Spears,"Well,i never think that Britney Spears is a great singer,she is not even a diva.However,i will say that I'm Not A Girl,Not Yet A Woman will be her best ballad to date.She sings it in a more natural way,at least she doesn't try to hit the higher notes for hitting the higher notes' sake.I Runaway is also another good track as her singing style and her vocal does show that she is more matured than before and she starts to know how to control her voice so that it will not be as annoying as Vanessa Carlton."
3,Times Change,"the show still has it's funny moments, but as with most shows of it's kind, it has certainly lost is cometic edge, and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, fan or not, unless they truly lost puppet/clamation involved adult humour."
1,Disappointed New Yorker,"I am absolutely shocked that this book has received so many good reviews. I think that Mr. Hamill had extra ""left over"" material from his novel ""Forever"" and decided to crank out another book. The material, though interesting, was arranged is a scattered manner and did not flow. All in my (NYC) book club agree that this book put them to sleep."
2,Disappointed!,"I had been eagerly waiting for the arrival of my order. However, I was very disappointed that there was no pictoral history of Broadway included. One and a half thumbs down!"
5,The Wise Men of Helm,"WOW! It's great to learn that this beloved book from my childhood is now available to my children via the Internet. I can't wait until my book arrives. I'm looking forward to reading to my children how the Wise Men captured the moon in a bucket of beat borsch, and all their other wonderful adventures that I remember fondly from my childhood!"
5,best blues piano book I've seen,"I've bought several other blues piano books over the years, and in my opinion this one outclasses them all. The pieces sound great, and the pacing of the material is fantastic. The book does a great job of slowly introducing the idea of improvisation, by encouraging mixing and matching ideas from the different pieces. It also goes into ideas like horizontal and vertical improvisation without making it too intimidating, and introduces some blues ""cliche"" endings and turnarounds. It covers many different styles from barrelhouse to stride to jazz blues.The included CD lets you know how this stuff is really supposed to sound, and it's got a full ""Recommended Listening"" in an appendix if you want to explore further. All around one of the best instructional musical texts I've seen."
2,Hopefully a Blu-ray version on the way,"Did not buy this product since the reviews are so bad. Even those who rated it higher say the video quality is not very good. I just sent an email to the Packers Pro Shop and they have assured me that many fans have send correspondence to them regarding their requests for a Blu-ray version. Hopefully they respond favorably to our requests. In the meantime, enjoy the Packers in Super Bowl XLVI in stunning HD on your television."
1,No Bluray??? Really???,Are they really not releasing this set in Bluray???? Does that mean every Super Bowl set from now on will only be released in DVD or are Packers fans just getting a raw deal.
1,Subpar effort,"I kept the super Bowl on my DVR and and video quality of this DVD is noticeably worse even for Joe six pack that doesn't have a blu ray player yet. Horrible decision to release this only on DVD, especially considering the large Packers fanbase. Hopefully they still have time to come to their senses and will release on blu ray or include two years if the Packers win again."
1,Not Interested,"If you want a SD version of the Super Bowl you can download it from YouTube for free. Like other reviewers, I have waited many months for this XLV DVD to be released and am EXTREMELY dissapointed with this product. I will hold out hope that Vivendi figures out what customers really want and release a Blu-Ray version (and soon!)."
1,Absurd,"The Repertoire releases of Frank Marino's first 3 albums on cd were taken from a vinyl source..if you like cd's with pops and clicks from a record, this will be right up your alley...a complete and utter waste of your money"
4,A well-organized tutorial on developing Access applications,"Mr. Callahan provides a well-organized, easy-to-follow tutorial on application development in Microsoft Access 95, emphasizing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). This book is an excellent introduction to Access programming. Hands-on training is provided on the accompanying diskette."
1,Not worth a star,"This product is incredibly off balance... right from the start! It's tilted, but even that doesn't help to keep your computer from tipping over! I wouldn't send one of these to my worst enemy, especially for this price range! I went to a store which sells ""over bed tables""... (check hospital sucpply houses where they sell products for use in bed etc...), and they had a ""Over bed table"" that made this one look like a toy for a third of the price!"
2,Good Design but Structrual LIght-Weight,"I purchased this cart to use as a work station over my favorite chair in the sun room. While the design works very well for this purpose, the structure is only minimally acceptable. The metal tubing used is marginally sturdy enough to hold the weight of my laptop and my forearms and the structural joint which connects the two parts of the base has enough flex that it is almost impossible to get the work surface level under the weight of the laptop alone. Fortunately, a little metal fabrication work in the shop should fix this problem but without the modification, I wouldn't give this item a lifespan of more than a few months of normal daily use. In retrospect, I probably would have gone for a bit more expensive unit in hopes of getting something a little sturdier."
4,Holy Scarefest!,"Bright young talent showcased in the context of modern horror. DVD slams in with a visually intoxicating start - featuring director Glenn McQuaid's ""Convulsion."" This is a really bizarre & interesting mix of sci-fi and horror a la Cronenberg meets Clive Barker. In fact - hats off to all filmmaakers who patricipated in this wakcy compilation."
2,First effort,"this album is interesting because it has ""Hellraiser"" on it. Anyone who's heard this song knows that Motley Crue lifted the ENTIRE lick for one of their crappy hits. For hardcore Sweet fans only, and because it contains a slew of Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman drival, I give it only two stars. The band does better in the future writing their own material. Maybe not album sales-wise, but the albums written by the band members are WAY better than this. ONLY 'Desolation Blvd' comes close with the Chinn/Chapman team, but that songwriting duo's featured only on one side of the LP. Most Sweet fans prefer the ""Give Us A Wink"" LP."
2,Not What I Expected,I agree with the other review. Sound quality is poor and it sounds like it was taken straight from records and not cleaned up at all. With all the great titles I'm truly disappointed. It also should have been clear that these are mixes. I'm a DJ so this album useless to me since all the breaks where you would want to mix are being mixed in...some not so great mixes either.
2,Poor sound,"I bought this because it has ""Dr. Love"" by First Choice in it's mix. The only problem is the tracks aren't remastered-ughhhh! All volumes from this cd series aren't remastered. The mixes however, aren't bad."
3,"Good selections, bad sound quality","The songs are all winners, but the sound quality is poor. Some of the songs sound like they were taken off a record and the snaps and pops weren't cleaned up. Plus, each song runs into the next, and instead of getting the entire song, you get like two minutes of each song. It's a good mix if you're having a party and want non-stop music, but otherwise I'd say don't bother."
1,Disk one defective,I have had two copies of this DVD. In both copies Disk 1 would not play. The other disks are OK.I am trying a third time. Hopefully I will have better results on my Sony DVD player.
5,The BEST WWll TV show ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All I can say is, IT IS ABOUT TIME!!!!!! Just like the WWll memorial in D.C.The DVD issue of these Excellent shows is WAY,Way,Way over due!!!!!Thanks to all involved for bringing them back!! I will be getting all of these memorials on film to ""The greatest generation"".Do yourself and your family a favor get these at all cost! God Bless America!! Come to think of it, He has!!"
3,Small Keys,"This item has some unique features, you can use it as a stand alone calculator it uses a standard watch battery so it is easy to find a replacement. it is able to transfer your calculations to the computer via a single button. There is a down side to this item the keys are on the smaller side; most external 10 keys have large keys this unit's keys are similar in size to a standard calculator so takes a little getting used to. All in all it is a good unit for the money."
5,Exceptional Designs,I am very pleased with this book. The designs are very beautiful and colorful. I have purchased books in the past that did not inspire me to begin a project like this book.
3,Goody Two Shoes Gets Mad,"Moorcock is able to build a rich world through words and develop a hero you can easily identify with. As Corum's idealistic world is destroyed by the new evil lately come, you begin to desire revenge as much as the character. Moorcock explores many of the darker areas of the human mind through Corum who has never experienced such feelings as revenge and hatred. Although this is good solid fantasy, the shades of good and evil one finds in the best of Moorcock do not seem to be here. Good and evil are readily identified, the symbolism beats you over the head but this is an excellent contrast to ""Elric: Song of the Black Sword"" and ""A Nomad of the Time Streams""."
2,"Although informative, quite boring and tedious to read","This book was a requirement for my 11th grade gifted and talented english program. Alhtough this book was quite informative, my classmates and I often found ourselves dozing off at home while completing the necessary reading. The book gave good background on the reasons behind the mass migration of the Puritans to New England, but if you don't have to read this book, I suggest you don't!"
1,SHAKEY,Just took my first dose and I am shaking all over almost ready to go to the ERI don't know whats going on but feeling nervous cold shakey scared.I will never take another one of these pills.It now has been 12 hours and still feel wierd when will this feeling stop grrrrrrrrrr
5,Cap fits!,Not much to say. Cap fits on my 58mm filter threaded lenses and on the filters themselves. Including Hoya HD filter and B+W UV filters.
1,Disappointed,Bought it from deepdiscounts ! It was delivered two weeks after the supposed date of arrival .. Not as described. I was fooled and thought it was the original but it is not. And it doesn't have the brand name Canon on it as the photo showed. Its quality is disappointing .. Will return it!
1,Silly,"I too have read all of Ms. Deveraux's books, but this one was very disappointing. It was just too silly! A complete waste of my time."
2,Wake me when It's Over,I did not like this book as much as I expected. I had read Lucifer's Flood first and expected something similar. I was dissapointed.
2,Jango Fett Blaster and Holster,"The advertisement was misleading and missing some important information. The listing for this product was unclear as to what size of a person it was for. Given that the electronic pistols had batteries and associated noises, I assumed it was for a child. However the belt was enormous -- I would guess it is for an adult with a minimum waist of probably 42"" and was not very adjustable to a smaller size. Since the item was purchased a couple of weeks before Halloween, there was no time to return it and get a replacement. There was a considerable amount of cutting and taping that had to be done in order to get this product to work for an 8-year-old. Also, the pistols in the picture appear to be silver while the actual product was white. As far as we can tell from looking at the movie, Jango Fett's pistols are SILVER, so we don't know why we were sent pistols of a different color."
1,LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE,"I'm super disappointed in this purchase. The reason I didn't buy these at Halloween USA for cheaper is because the bright orange and white guns look nothing like blasters. The picture shows a grey/silver blaster, not a bright orange one which is what I got. I am returning this product."
2,Guns manufactured incorrectly,"The endcaps that screw onto the base of the guns had tabs that were incorrectly manufactured. We had to use a knife to cut the tabs off before we could unscrew the cap to insert the batteries. Also, one of the endcaps did not make proper contact with the battery, so one gun didn't work."
5,Good 90s Compilation,"It focuses primarily on the early 1990s, but this compilation is a really good overview of some forgotten acts. Some hard to find songs, such as ""If Wishes Came True"" and ""I'll Be Your Everything"" are here. All of these songs, with the exception of ""Hold On"" by En Vogue were #1 pop hits (it peaked at #2, close enough). This compilation also includes the beautiful ""I Don't Have the Heart"" and the overused-for-compilations ""To Be With You"". In addition, the classic ""Black Velvet"" is here, as is ""I Ador Mi Amor"", a forgotten Spanglish tune by Color Me Badd. The weirdest song here is the borderline-novelty ""Informer"", by Snow. The album also includes ""Romantic"" by Karen White, one of the last hits of the pre-Soundscan era. An essential (and bargain priced) compilation for early-90s pop fans."
5,Headlights are great. So is customer service,"I had ordered these back in January and haven't had the time to get around to installing them. So they sat in their box for the past month(over 30 days) and when I installed them this morning one of them didn't work. No big deal, called up Amazon and they are getting me a free replacement with one day shipping and free return shipping on the busted light.I've had them in my Jeep before and they are great. Far better than the stock ones that come in it and other replacements on the market. I'd order and used these lights again."
3,Ready to Rumble?,"The 8750 prints fantastic quality prints and would be a great deal for the in home graphic designer. You have to be prepared for the quirkiest software you've ever used. I bought this on close out for $240 and am thinking that it may not be worth it because of the frustration and uncertainty that are part of the 8750. Planning a project is hard with this printer printing ghost pages, pulling the paper in crooked, etc.When you can get it to do what you want the quality is fantastic. If you can find a printer of equal print quality and price, however, leave the 8750 behind, there's no way it could be any more difficult to use."
2,HP 8750 Review,"Not what I was hoping for...upgraded from a CP1700....Oooops.This thing eats ink, is ridiculously slow, prints faded images (with no insight from tech support) and consistanly pulls multiple pages.Oh but it looks nice. No more HP's for this kid..."
5,old India,"Wow. This book was written in the 1920's. Before Indian independence and before the separation of Hindu and Islam. When read with this knowledge it really is an incredible novel and explains (indirectly) the many differences between the Hindu and Muslim and British occupiers. It's essentially about the interaction of people from different cultures. I watched the David Lean film after reading the book and , although there were small differences, it was an excellend portrayal of the book. Why is it it in top 100 list? For me it's because of Forster's incredible descriptions and the way he paints a picture with these descriptions. Words to be tasted. Words to be scented. Sometimes the absence of description also adds to the mystery that is India. Wow."
2,the book took awhile to get interesting.,"The book itself wasn't wasn't a real ""gripper"" and I thought that the whole plot wasn't intact. Although most of this had to do with the fact that it was an assignment from school I still think that the whole idea about someone being framed for a crime is all to knowledgable. I had a pretty good idea as to how the book would end. I did however like the fact that mrs.moore kept to herself in her feelings about Aziz's innocence.She could have jepordized her spot in society.So the bottom line is unless you have no life you willnot read this book."
1,Appalling ! Forster probably never went to India....,"As an Indian, born and brought up in India, this book appearedextremely shallow to me...the Indian characters are unbelievable and their descriptions highly biased..the portrayal of Hindus especially is highly ludicrous...also the story seems to indicate the superiorty of the British people throughout; even though Forster shows the British people in a poor light, he saves the day by making a martyr of Mrs Moore and Miss Questad...Forster probably never went to India, nor did he really know anyIndians, his novel is India seen through the eyes of a BritishColonialist who ""thought"" he knew everything about India and Indians. I am sorry for the people who think that this novel isa true portrayal of anything that is remotely Indian."
5,Pensive Opera Arias,I first became aware of this music several months ago. I listen to this CD quite a bit while driving. I really welcome these Opera Arias.
4,Ca u say beach,"YES Beach, we take our chairs to the beach... we love to sit for hours on the beach but the chairs were always so uncomfortable. We take the umbrella chairs, cooler and off we go.!! great way to save your back."
1,Surprisingly little tracking information for a tracking book,"I bought this after a Search and Rescue mission, hoping to get an insight on tracking subjects that may be avoiding the search teams.The author spends over half the already short text on either self-congratulatory war stories or ""my favorite gun"" weapon reviews. The latter in fact are so totally subjective as to be essentially useless. (As a side note, it was the only time in my life I've EVER heard the Mini-14 referred to as having ""excellent accuracy"")This book is a definite pass. After a quick skim, I sent it straight back to Amazon to get Jack Kearney's ""Tracking, a blueprint for learning how."""
3,"Stellar cast, good story",Put it this way... I wash my hands a lot more. This movie really makes you think of how you would deal with such a situation if it really happened!
3,Contagion,"Loved the movie, had me intrigued all the way. Highly recommended.Can't believe how many great actors were in the movie, scary thought that it could all become true."
3,I expected a lot more action.,"The movie was good if you just wanted to relax and pass a little time. I guess from the ads on TV, I expected a whole lot more action and energy. The Actors were good, but not convincing enough to really make this movie a hit."
2,Eh,"From the previews and the stars of the movie, I expected an interesting, thought provoking movie. Contagion was a good idea. Unfortunately, I found it to be boring."
2,Boring,"This movie is boring, good actors, bad dialog, and slow progression.THe movie is basically showing how fast a virus can become a global epidemic in a matter of hours, i have to admit though, i'm kind of paranoid about being in enclosed spaces now."
2,Wow!,This movie had no excitement. You could predict the whole plot from beginning to end. It was produced from using other movie ideas of the same nature. Don't waste your money.
4,Entertaining!,"For those who like the type of movie (think: Outbreak, I am Legend, The Stand, 28 Days Later, etc.) where the world is essentially taken over by something uncontrollable, this was a great new addition. It doesn't at all have the supernatural/horror aspect to it like I am Legend or 28 Days Later, but I liked it for the same reason I like those -- it makes you think! Simple as that. The cast was good, and the storyline kept me entertained and interested through the very end."
3,"Interesting, but a waste of great talent","Since so many of my favorite actors were in this, I thought there must be more to it than the movie's title revealed. I was wrong. All I can say is either there are many great actors who are worried about a recurrence of the Great Plague, or they saw other stars signing up and said, ""I better get in on this."" Worth a watch if you have time, but don't put it on the top of your list."
2,Lacking in Plot,"I'm a big fan of this genre of movies, but I was very disappointed by Contagion. The plot just plain sucks. I had high hopes, but somewhere, either in the writing or directing, someone failed to sufficiently develop the plot line. The viewer is left feeling like they missed a good hour of the movie (it's very short)."
2,Boring,"This movie was a flat line to me. The character development was poor, and the plot never seemed to pick up. Overall it was quite boring."
1,horrible,"I wish i could get this time back because it was huge waste of time. Seemed like a long CDC infomercial. No substance, weird collages to music. Very very bad movie & worst ive seen in some time!"
1,Made me wish I got infected,"Oh man, brutally bad movie. Acting wasn't bad, but story was like watching a History Channel documentary on this is what happens when a serious virus attacks. Ending was the only part I liked."
2,"The virus may be active, but this film is dramatically inert","It seems incredible that they could make a film about a contagious virus that is utterly devoid of any sense of drama. But this is it. The film is essentially static. It has all the dramatic impact of a dead fern. Awful script. Words are uttered, but they seem almost disembodied. And I really could have been spared seeing the divine Kate Winslet in a body bag, with the attendants dumping her body and telling us that more body bags are on the way. This flick is a stinker, to be avoided like -- well, the plague."
1,Major Dud,"Yes, there are a lot of stars but overall this movie was a DUD; very choppy and boring. While it might have some good moments, it didn't hold my interest at all; my husband actually walked out of the room to play video games."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"The cast in this movie blew me away. The cast alone is why I went to see this. BUT, the cast wasn't worth the time wasted on it. This movie is terrible. It is soo depressing it will make you think getting that disease would be better than suffering through this movie. You will never get that time back, it is seriously gone forever. Skip it. Save Yourself!!"
4,Palestrina revisited,"lovely, mysterious, serene, sorrowful, glorious. The Hilliard Ensemble is without a doubt unrivaled in its performance of this exquisite music."
2,"stupid and offensive, but there is some action there","This is not a complete loss, there are some well written scenes, there is a thrill and there is an intrigue.But, practically everybody acts stupid and there is a feeling that the most of the figures are simply cut out from the cardboard. And the biggest problem is that I found some parts of Holocaust-related line very offensive to the memory of my great grandfather and others who were killed."
3,Okay read,"I like all of Silva's stuff, but he is sliding downhill a bit. Is he bored with Gabriel Allon?"
5,love this series,"love when an author carries the main characters throughout a series. Love the book, hope there are more"
4,Silva takes his place at the top,"This is the 4th Silva book I have read, all with Allon.All good, exciting, educational and with a purpose. As a recent spy novelist, I rank Silva at the top.....A good read...."
4,Good History Book!,Our hero Gabriel Allon(also known as Mario Delvecchio)is restoring a painting in Venice. An okd friend is severly injured by a bombing at the Holocaust Claims office in Venice.Allonmeets up with another Holocaust survivor named Max Klein whotells Allon that his friend was hurt because Klein has discovereda Nazi war criminal is living in Venice.Upon further checking hediscovers that the same criminal is actually Eric Radek whoabused his mother during the Death March.He discovers that theCIA employed this man as an agent after World War II and alsoprotected him.Allon also traces Radek through the Vatican and down to Argentina.Allon also discovers that Radek's son is about to be elected Chancellor of Austria.It is left up to Allon tobring justice to the Holocaust survivors and victims. A very interesting book that you will enjoy reading.
1,"Bitter, Tasteless, and Smacking of Disloyalty","I came to this book through my love of Steven Tyler's autobiography. I thought his was fascinating, creative and well-written, but it left many questions. To answer them, I ended up reading Mia Tyler's book, Walk this Way, Joey Kramer's book, and this one. All of them were worthy in their own rite EXCEPT Cyrinda's. Although I do feel sorry for her, it is not for the reasons she wants me to. I find her slamming of Steven Tyler cynical sour grapes and also distasteful. And while it is pretty clear that Cyrinda was an abused child, it is so hard to read this book knowing that she has a child with Steven Tyler...how could she do that, how could she write this terrible book knowing that her daughter would and could read it?"
1,Nothing Good About It,"I felt bad giving one star to this book. It doesn't deserve it. This book is great for bloodthirsty wanna-be's and other miscreants. It is valuable only as an example of what ninja arts are not. From a martial art perspective, it contains no orginal material. Some people might like it. I think Ashida (funny name for a white guy) is a fraudulent sham."
3,So close to being a 5 star,"These batteries for a Canon HV-10 are ever so slightly - too short.With a piece of tape added to the end of the battery it works.Only then do the contacts connect.Why does buying a battery have to be such a crap shoot?Sure, I could buy the Canon brand for 3 times the cost of the aftermarket batteries.Can you even trust the brand names?Lenmar at least puts their name on the Chinese batteries they sell.In the past I have been happy with Lenmar.Not so happy this time."
4,"Good quality, Excelent price","I use this battery pack on my Canon HR-10. It fits perfectly and it last about 1 1/2 to 2 hours every time. I'm not sure if it will last as long as a original Canon pack, but for almost 1/4 of the price I can just re-buy when ever it stops holding the charge."
3,"Nice Product, Cheap Materials","This is a nice looking product, but beware of the cheap plastic. I have owned several Topeak products, and the plastics portions of each product always tend to break. The products are well designed and look nice, they just need to be more selective on their materials."
5,The Rarer Pieces,"As very few will probably check this CD out (as the number of votes I've received for my Vol.1 review has proved--2), I will keep the number of words to a minimum. This second installment of Marco Polo's epic series of Lumbye's music is by far the most delightful. As far as I know, all the numbers in this set are premiere recordings. This volume starts out with the invigorating ""A Little Ditty for the Party, Galop"" and ends with the charming ""Goodnight Polka"". As with Vol.1, the Tivoli Symphony Orchestra, with Bellicampi conducting, perform this music masterfully. However, the sound quality is still a bit poor for a DDD recording (sound seems distant). But on the whole, this volume is excellent. It's got my 5 star vote! For those who care, read my review for volume 1 for more information."
3,"Great, but not for long","I love this belt clip. Its so easy to get on and off and you have access to all the buttons. However, anyone who gave this a great review hasn't used it for more than 3 months. My first one started dropping out of the case as the case became more flexible with time. I thought maybe I had a bum case, so I bought another and the same thing happened. I tried to bend it to tighten it and it broke."
2,Too tight and it BROKE!,"This holster arrived so tight when installed, it interfered with the touch screen. Also this holster has to be removed to put your Treo into the docking station - which is no easy task as tightly as it fits. I tried to loosen the holster's grip a little by ""spreading its wings"" but this resulted in the cheap metal the leather is glued to BREAKING instead of bending. The clip itself is also huge - nearly 3/4 inch thick! Hardly a slim holster. Mine is getting returned."
1,Damaged phone -snapped catch - Disaster,"I used this for about three hours - Due to it making the phone stick out so far the first time I walked through the cube maze at work - bump - new phone scratched to the point of damage on the screen - great, a $24 clip costs me a $600 phone.I get into my car and - Snap - the cach is broken.Never buy this - it is the worst product on the market."
1,Long and tedious even though it's under 200 pages,"This is an incredibly dull book. I was forced to read it for a religion class and I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews of it. It is very tedious and the wording is old, making it all the more hard to read. I am not a hugely religious person and I would never recommend this book to a friend, possibly an enemy, but never a friend. If you're having sleeping problems, this book would be a great remedy."
4,hilarious!,"this book is written in the form of varies letters written from a evil demon who is advising his nephew on how to be a better and more effectively evil demon,as the nephew is lacking in that department.its very entertaning i think.its done in a playful and interesting way or maybe its just me.read it and see.its not satanic or anything just philosophical satire from my point of view.a good read!"
5,Great Book,This is a masterpiece. People just don't write like this anymore. If anyone told you not to get this book they are crazy.
5,Screwtape Letters Revised Edition,"Although short the ""Screwtape Letters"" is one of the finest reads around. Christian Satire that makes you really think about just who you are and how you are affected by the evils around you. The Revised Version is a must to own - no Christian library should be without it. Teens love it too!"
4,screwtape letters,"This is a really interesting book.It is not the kind of book that you can just read anywhere though.The most difficult part of this book is being able to wrap my brain around evil thinking.I think the majority of people are not raised to be evil,we are told at a very young age that being a good little girl or boy is the best thing that we can do.Well in this book the main characters are evil and they truly want others to be so.This is the kind of book that would be great for a bookclub to disect."
5,Amazing Insight,Lewis writes with such incredible insight into the ways satan attacks us. The wisdom in the book is timeless. The language is a bit awkward but that's okay - it just means you need to slow down and read it more carefully. A must read for Christians regardless of your spiritual age. A true literary classic.
5,Beautiful,"C.S. Lewis approaches the side of this enemy in this unbiased account of two demons trying to secure the rapture if this unnamed ""patient"" during a war torn era. His ability to bring things to life almost makes you learn the voice if your own demons and to challenge your own depths in this enlightening book. With 31 letters, this book is perfect for studying over the course of a month. I would recommend The Screwtape Letters to anybody that deals with unknown demons."
3,Way ahead of it's time,"This writer was way ahead of his time. This book to me was difficult to understand, but then, i'm probably not the most intelligent person out there. It's one that you have to read slowly. Each sentence says a lot. Sort of like the bible. A required reading in some schools. Just not my cup of tea. Probably more for the intellictual types."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is a bootleg CD (CD-R) AND it has the wrong songs on it. No liner notes, just a bootleg CD that already had fingerprints on it when I opened it. This is a total rip-off! I already informed Amazon.com about this so I can get a full refund."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this DVD. As it was, I saw this movie when it first came out at a local drive in, (an outdoor movie theatre, for you youngsters), and enjoyed it. So when I saw it on DVD I jumped on it. That was a big mistake. The picture and sound quality are both terrible and the movie has been heavily edited. This is a definite rip off, stay away from it."
2,not bright,"the headlights on my 97 chevy blazer were so dim it was hard to see at night if it was raining. when i looked for replacements these sounded great. they are better quality, glass instead of plastic, and a bit brighter, but still dim. i also have an 04 mercedes and the headlights on those are incredible. i can see better on low beam in that car than the hi beam with these new sylvania. bottom line, disappointed big time."
2,awful sound quality,"while this cd has a great selection of songs from the heyday of disco the sound quality was very poor. In almost every track there are dead spots where the music stops playing for several seconds. At first I thought vibration was making my cd player skip, but I played the disc in 4 different players with the same disappointing results. The sound quality is as I said poor, sounds like a cd someone burned on their home pc. I would look elsewhere for collections to purchase--specifically from companies that have a track record to go by(Sony, Rhino etc.) I gave it 2 stars only for the song selection."
3,An ok book,This book hits some good points. It has alot of good things to say and it would be great for a kid just starting to read. It talks about the shear devastation that handling accidents with nucleur power and some day how we will be able to handle nuclear energy better. So I think this is a good book to read.
1,measurements,The Carroll file cabinet and desk and the above have no measurements. Can't seem to get that information anywhere.
4,Yah!,I can't stop listening to this disc! It is so good. I have several more by this artist. A great addition to any Reggae collection.
2,You Can't Always Believe The Hype,"Skip Spence's only solo album doesn't even come close to sounding anything like Moby Grape. Instead, expect something like an American version of Syd Barret with a lower voice. He may be a cult hero and a big influence to a few famous rock stars, but this album doesn't cut it for me."
4,NMR for Novice Master and Refresher,"The book is a complete saga of NMR with relevant references. To learn NMR for macromolecules, just go through it.........you will reach the destination."
1,Vampire,"Aswang means Vampire in the Tagalog language (from the Philippines). It is a particular kind of vampire, one that feeds on unborn babies. Thus these vampires have very very long tongues... to get to their meal. This could have led to some very sick/sexy situations but this film has none. They 'intend' to feed on a victim and the film is all about trying to get her (or rather her unborn)."
2,Bought to replace a laptop keyboard,"I bought this to replace a key board on my laptop, the connector cable was in the wrong place, couldn't use it so Make sure before you buy...!"
5,great whenI don't want to tote my big bag,"This is a nice quality holster that fits my T3i perfectly! My larger lens 18-133mm sits perfectly in this holster, and if I want to use my smaller lens, all I do is attatch the included velcro sling. Super for the boat and for walking around compared to my big bag.I do agree with another reviewer...don't see why the greenish/gold tip was needed in the design but not a showstopper and it doesn't look too weird...just more curious as to why it was done that way!"
5,Excellent day holster,Love this holster! Sturdy enough to protect the camera and lens well but still very light. I only use the velcro closure which makes access easy and quick. It has a sling which can be removed for a longer zoom. I originally bought it for a gift and liked it so much I bought myself one.
2,larger than picture,"Plenty of padding. Larger than picture. Camera fits well with plenty ofroom for longer lens and extra discs, cleaners. Belt strap on back adds bulk. Would be better if designed for using the camera's own neck strap instead of adding another neck strap to deal with. Also, there is no way to attach this case to your own camera'sstrap."
3,Ok for the price,"Build quality and design are not great.The zipper head inside the top cover may leave scratch on the back of the camera - could have been just a velcro. It looks huge from outside for a holster style but not enough useful space inside for Rebel XSi - a lot of 1/2"" thick dead space around the camera and lens not very useful for storing accessories. Could have had more storage pockets outside and shrunk the bag a little bit. A buckle-strap might be used to the top cover instead of velcro.Some of above issues my be solved by putting camera strap first then the camera body and lens. However, the design, color, texture and size all remind me of military equipment not camera - even with a canon logo.I am returning it and will pick one at a local camera store after carefully evaluating the design inside and out."
3,Cabob Zoom Pack 1000 for Rebel Series,"The case fits the Rebel snug and there is plenty of room for the battery pack and cords. I sent the item back because it is rather awkward for packing. However, with that being said all the camera cases are large and it depends on the functionality and comfort level you are looking for when you purchase this item. I personally would not carry this around my shoulder. I bought this for our trip to Europe and it needed to fit in a book bag and the size and triangular shape didn't leave much room."
3,Good brochure-type instruction manual,"A giveaway manual that Atlanta Cutlery used to send with do-it-yourself knife kits. I believe it was $3 if purchased separately. Very useful to the beginner who wishes to learn to assemble knives on a prepared blade. For similar, but modern, tutorials with color pictures, search Internet for North Coast Knives. Atlanta Cutlery still sells first-rate knife blanks, as do several other providers."
3,"helpful advise, but too small!","After learning the bridge basics, I found this tablecloth extremely helpful at bridge parties. It's a useful tool for knowing how to bid or how to respond to your bridge partner's bid. I like the layout of the information as well, very clear and logical.However, the table cloth itself is tiny, would barely function on a small card table. I wish that it came in a larger size and in nicer material.An alternative is the set of placemats with similiar information. The information isn't laid out as well, but the mats are more functional and less expensive (I believe)."
2,Not what I was expecting,No drawings and very dry. Did not get me interested in reading further in the book. I'd like to see a print version to see if they differ any.
3,Entertaining in a stupid way,"Imagine a cross between James Bond and Blade, but played for laughs. The gore is as over-the-top as Kill Bill, but the fight sequences really suck, and not in a good way. The special effects are pretty bad too. It's funny, but almost too stupid even to be funny. I gave it three stars because it was entertaining enough to be worth watching (once), I laughed several times. And I winced at the terrible fight choreography several times too. It's really a toss up."
1,"Would be zero if it could, ridiculous","This book is the most ridiculous kind of tripe. All over the world there are people who just never quite fit in with other people, it doesn't make them aliens! This book attempts to tell such people they are really alien souls sent to inhabit human bodies on Earth for some purpose. It is nonsense. If your socially maligned don't try chalking it up to being ET, you may have some underlying psychological issues.What a coincedence as well when the author, midway through the book, decides, guess what he's an alien too!.The book also deals with another ridiculous topic, called walk ins. People who were normal, but then through some kind of alien soul magic, are now filled with the soul of an Alien!This is ridiculousness to the highest order. It is also very low, attempting to exploit those who don't quite fit in for book sales with cocomamy theories that have no critical or empirical evidence whatsoever into this tripe."
5,"an excellent book, must read!","well, i was doing a project that required some very simple interface with a serial device, this book was the only book i brought and it coved more than enough material to make my project work.about the VB code, well, what i can say, I was using VB.....well, the book had a very in depth cover of the hardware and the standard of the rs232c. If you want to know how the electronics works, this is the book for you.if you just want some quick and dirty tricks to make the connection work, this book will also do. as i said early, it had VB examples. in 15 minutes, you will know the basics, and programing in no time!"
4,"Great book, no software","This is a operations management book for painting contractors. It is a very good book. But for it to be of any use, the contractor must invest time to create or change existing procedures. I would have given it five stars, but the software doesn't work. Next, I'll review McGraw-Hill's customer service operations. PS. Mr. Gleason wrote another book with data and software for estimating. I only previewed it, but it looks like a good tool."
5,lots of pockets,Im 54 and I find all the pockets to be very advantageous for cell phone and misc. They're comfortabe and they look nice.
4,Truck Bed Step by Bully,"Getting to the bed of my Silverado Truck was difficult when hauling my 5th wheel. I had to carry a small stool in order to access the bed. I purchased the Bully AS-550 side steps and the problem was solved. They were a snap to install and they are rock solid when I step on them. When not in use, they rotate to the side out of the way. The step is built out of cast aluminum and the supports are thick welded steel, all giving the step a solid mount. The only negative, and it is slight, is that the step could be a bit wider and they do rattle a little when I hit a bump.Otherwise I give them an A. A definate need on a pickup. Ken"
3,something is wrong here ...,"i did a track by track comparison of this cd with the ""sun sessions cd"" from a couple of decades ago. want to know what i found?a few of the songs are remarkably different! instrumental passages where vocals used to exist. vocal passages where instrumental pieces used to exist. you have to have a very careful ear to notice the changes, but they are there. somebody at rca must have screwed around with the recordings to make them ""sound as good as ever"", but, for me, history has been changed.very strange."
4,on time,The book arrived in a short amount of time and in good shape. I look forward to reading the book soon. Thanks!
4,An entertaining novel that puts the reader in the mind of the interpreter,"There are several fictional accounts of interpreters, but ""The Interpreter,"" a novel by Suki Kim is a particularly great suspense read -- and an interesting view into what can happen when an interpreter is presented with a conflict of interests.The book tells the story of Suzy Park, a Korean-American court interpreter in New York City. On one of her assignments, she interprets for a witness who, she realizes, knows something about the death of her own parents many years earlier. As a result, she begins looking into her own past in order to unravel the mystery of her parents' homicide.An entertaining book!"
3,printed in Korea!,"I expected much better quality. Some of pages have words dimmed and even hard to distinguish, especially in the red letters."
3,Would love to give this five stars...,"...but I won't. I felt cheated by the ending of this movie. The beginning was unique and atmospheric, mysterious and intriguing. But toward the end it turned into just another horror movie explanation ending, and the horror itself was more pathetic and a social commentary rather than scary. I don't think the secret of the building was worthy of the psychosis that it inspired in the residents of the building. I think the premise for the movie seemed better in the screen writer's mind than it looked on film. I would have rather not had any explanation at the end and I think I would have enjoyed this movie more. For me it was a letdown, but it was still worth the viewing."
3,GREAT EXPECTATIONS....broken,"Well when I first heard ""Angel of Mine"" on MTV, I thought it was a great song and I also heard that ""The First Night"" remix was on there and I thought that song was pretty good so I went and bought the Single. ""Angel of Mine"" is great but the remix of ""The first night"" is horrible...I cant stand a second of it. It's so irritating and annoying. So I gave it 3 stars since half of the single is good."
5,The music and her voice blend so well!,She is a very good singer/songwriter. She is gorgeous and has an awesome voice. Definately buy it! A+++
3,Not as good as his other Albums,"I picked this Album up a while back. Usually I listen through it and throw it in my Alpine and go cruising. This Album I listened to it through and it was somewhat dissapointing. If you only buy one SPM album, make it ""3rd wish"" or ""Never Change"""
3,it was alright,"this cd was alright, I was a little disappointedthe only good songs were Dope Game, You Know My Name, Rollin, and I Wanna Know Her Name"
4,Nice big toaster,"This toaster is a very nice one. Like all toasters it takes some time getting used to the settings. The only thing that I dislike about this toaster is the size, it is bigger than my previous one."
1,One Year is All You Get!,"I purchased this toaster from Amazon back in April 2009. I spent a lot of time researching toasters because I wanted something that was durable and would last a while. Honestly, this has not had a ton of use. The right side stopped working a couple months ago. The lever would not stay down. Today, I contacted Kitchenaid and they said after a year there is nothing they can do except offer me a discount on a newer model. They said they do not repair their toasters. I think when you pay $100 for an item with a good brand name, it should be replaced or at least repaired. This is the last Kitchen Aid appliance I will be purchasing."
5,FINALLY,"This toaster is awesome. It is very well constructed with easy to use dials and levers. It toasts everything evenly no matter if you prefer lightly toasted or well done. I have tried many other brands without satisfaction. I had been using an old, faithful Black & Decker toaster which the plastic lever broke off years ago. Throughout my long search for a new toaster (with many failed attempts), I had been using a jar lid as a makeshift lever. Sounds strange, I know, but when you're desperate you'll try anything.Other reviewers mentioned that this toaster works slow, but I didn't think it took much longer than any other I've tried. Besides, when you consider that you can have something perfectly toasted for you to enjoy, who's in a hurry?Some people thought it was pricey, but when you see how solid this toaster is and how well it works you'll be glad you spent a little extra.Consider this toaster when you're shopping, you won't be disappointed."
4,Toasts great but difficult to remove English muffins,"I love the way this toaster evenly toasts bread, bagels and english muffins but wish it would raise higher in order to remove the english muffins."
4,A great book to introduce the Navajo Traditions,As a teacher I found this book to be a great introduction to the Navajo life and traditons. The photographs show the beautiful part of the country they live in and crafts of the Navajo. I would recommend this book to other teachers. The text is not difficult to read and there are few words on each page. The history of the Navajo and the way of life both in the past and present are summarized. A great way to intoduce the native american tribe.
2,Talk about anti-climactic,"Graphics are awesome, sound is top notch, control is sketchy at first but evens out. . . fine, these are all great attributes of Sudeki but it only took TEN HOURS to finish!!! When a video game is being billed as the ""next big thing"" to hit a genre (RPG) I expect it to take longer than my cousin reciting the alphabet. It took me longer to finish Zelda 64! Don't but this game, just rent it twice and save yourself sixty bucks. . . now i have to figure out a way to get Zellers to give me my money back."
1,Not a single copy works,"We bought this Multipass730 and set it up today. After working with Canon Tech Support for a long time, not a single drop of ink is appearing on the test pages. We have now been told to take it to a service center Monday thru Friday. Today is Friday at 5pm, so we can't use the printer this entire weekend. What a loser we have purchased!!!"
5,Very pleased,"My husband and I were looking to purchase a multi-function copier/fax/scan/printer; our research led us to Canon; Amazon was by far the cheapest, so I ordered one. I have had absolutely no problems. I love this machine. I use it a lot for my job and have found it up to the task. It prints quickly and faxes with no problems. I have not tried the scanner function yet. It prints beautiful photos. I love the separate ink cartridges. I would highly recommend this product"
5,Excellent book for people in this field,"I found this book to be full of information. Instead of giving a vague and general outline of the Incoterms (for example, just listing EXW as buyer pays all shipping), Reynolds go full bore into the subject with what if's scenarios, detailed look at each one and tells you how each contract is implemented and the limits of each term. He even put copies of pro formas for some of the incoterms!Considering the fact that this book is more than half the price of the ICC book and tailored to Americans, I highly recommend it!"
1,I would not ever buy this again,"It does not work right and the water taste really bad I put my old one back and till i went to home depot, sometime its worth to pay a little more for things."
4,"Decent sheets, but softness varied between color sets...","First of all, I've noticed that the majority of the rave reviews for Pinzon products are from Seattle, which is where Amazon (parent company of Pinzon) is located. Probably just coincidence, but funny nonetheless. Keep an eye out on that, though. Now back to the sheets. I bought them in both the Mink and the White, and noticed a huge difference between the two colors. The White is very soft and washed beautifully, while the Mink (aka brown) felt much more scratchy. The subtle design is very nice on both, and I can definitely ""stand"" sleeping with the Mink ones, but I'm also not too picky with sheets. I would say that if you have a difficult time with mildly scratchy sheets, these may be less than ideal for you... that is, depending on your color selection. This, of course, was my experience. I just ordered one set of the Supima ones and hope to find that ""really soft"" set. Happy sheet shopping!"
2,Sheets pilled within 1 wash,"I was very impressed with the finish of the sheets when they first arrived. After washing them and the using them, they started to pill where my skin is rough (I have eczema). No other ""sateen"" sheets I have ever bought have done this, and this is extremely disappointing. I think it's attributed to the herringbone pattern, nevertheless, very disappointing. I would be wary of the actual quality of these sheets."
2,7 inch run in sheet.,Fitted sheet had a 7 in. run in it. To pay postage and package to return is not worth the time. There may be some quality control issues at the factory. Ordered two sets and that was the only defect I noticed.
5,Fantastic Vaulue,"You can't do any better for the money and the pattern give it a little something extra. Soft and great looking, wash up nice too. If your looking for a quality sheet set this is a good one to pick."
2,Made in China. and no thread count info,Anyone noticed that the thread count that is advertised on the amazon website is not to be seen anywhere on the product? Or did I just happen to order all the sheets that do not show this number anywhere. I ordered the 440 thread count white herringbone Pinzon King sHEET SET & right now after one wash I am not sure if this is cotton anymore. Anyone feel the same way? Do you know where I can verify the thread count?Is amazon ripping the customer off? Bring on all your opinions
4,LOVE it!,This product was a GREAt price and well worth it! I love these sheets! they are comfortable and they fit over my pillow top king size bed (which is hard to find) I would recommend them to anyone!
1,Failure to disclose,"[[ASIN:B002BXD6FU Typewriter Ribbon Canon AP01 SC70 Compatible]This item, purchased from Amazon could not be shipped to Canada by the vender. This was not disclosed until after the order was placed. It was therefore necessary to arrange delivery to my son's address in the US and request forwarding. Arrival in the US has been confirmed but I have yet to receive it so can not review.Aside from that, I was oleased to fine a cartridge source for my old Cannon S68-S Typewriter."
2,Poorly written,"I love laughter yoga, but I could probably learn as much about its theory on the net as this book offers. The writing is full of run-on sentences and repetitive paragraphs. I wish Dr. Kataria had a better editor."
4,there is a good reason to laugh for no reason,This book was very good. It gives a layout of how to run laughing club sessions while also explaining the physiological benefits of laughter.
1,Save your money,"I have an interest in organic gardening and from what I have read about the properties of Amazonian Dark Earths, I believed this would be a very desirable book to own. I was mistaken. It is basically a bunch of scientific papers bundled together and given a cover. It is NOT a how to book. Save your money!"
3,Meeting oneselves...,"This book was a very easy read. The thing I didn't understand is how the Doctor's memory was able to be erased like that.If you watched the show you can imagine him doing this, but otherwise it got confusing."
2,a disappointment,The quality of this recording leaves a lot to be desired. The only saving grace is that the music is great. I have learned not to buy these collections again as somehow they mess up when copying the originals.
1,This road goes nowhere,"Of all the novels I have read, this may be the worst. In the style of ""Columbo"" type TV shows you find out pretty quick who our detective thinks is the killer, the only surprise is how he catches him. The author also has a common but bad habit of endowing his protagonist with the sensibilities and morals of a 21st Century ""moral majority"" type Republican.All this makes for characters that are stiff as a board and a plot that is an extra."
4,"A triple threat; composer, piano player, arranger band leader","I'm not sure exactly what I like more, the composer or the piano player. I purchased this after buying Lilacs and everything at the Goodwill for 3 dollars. What an investment, this CD was 3 dollars plus shipping.As a band leader and composer he wanders around the world of Jazz and Classical music beaming in the same sunshine. His music really moves me. I have another to listen to for Christmas, the Saxaphone orchestra. Love the Nexo jazz concept, the art cover is very hip and interesting.The only reason I don't give it five stars is because that standard is to high for almost all musicians. A musician will tell you that 5 stars are reserved for the celestial greats."
4,Makes me want to go out and get copies of all the Crosby hymns out there!,"Parts of the book were TMI (too much information) about the life and times of Fanny Crosby. Yet, one of the reasons I really love this book is for the tmi!--a real treasure house of information about those all those names associated with Crosby whom we hear so little about: William Bradbury, Philip Bliss, George Root, William Doane, Phoebe Palmer Knapp, William Kirkpatrick, Ira Sankey, etc.If you are a hymn lover, you will love this book about one of the most beloved hymn writers of all time."
1,i agree with the other guy,"yeah, i got this cd too, expecting something great -- due to reading some reviews -- but there are many more quality bands out there. I don't get the hype either..."
3,activities most helpful,"A lighter weight book for survivors. I found the activities she suggested to be helpful in helping me sleep at night, rid myself of some thoughts of guilt, and move forward with my life. I did find it to be religious (Christian) which didn't help me as much as Carla Fine's book, No Time to Say Goodbye. It was not judgemental however. It's openminded and offered me some comfort. Easy to read in one sitting."
3,On the fence,"I'll have to use it more to give a better review, but so far I do like it although its very challenging for a beginner like myself."
3,not for beginners,i am actually not a beginner and i am very strong and flexible but i found this video very strenuous. there was not much fluidity in the movements and it moved very fast. there was not enough time in between movements to coordinate proper breathing and i wound up not feeling very well when i was done. there were some good poses though but i will have to do them on my own without the video.
4,Will need some experience first - great otherwise.,"I've completed an introductory yoga course at a gym and so thought I'd give this one a go. I'm reasonably fit and was looking for something that would test me. I got that! This is reasonably fast paced and I think you need to know some basic yoga moves by name to be able to keep up. If you are comfortable with that, you'll really enjoy it. I can't get through the whole work out in one go, yet, but I wasn't looking for something that I'd be able to keep up with first go and get bored with. If you are at a novice or an intermediate level, you'll find yourself coming back to this one for a challange."
4,good,"As low level intermediate I thought this was good, but not as good as Total Yoga with Tracey White and Ganga.Total Yoga is easier to follow and seems to flow smoother. It also seems to work more areas of the body."
5,Totally Powerful Yoga,"This is an awesome work out. It is for pretty much anyone who has done yoga for a while. It really helps people who are trying to move from beginner to intermediate and then help you get a good foundation to move further. It is probably the best work out I have ever had, and I have been working out for long time. I feel as though I lose five pounds every time I do this dvd. Rodney Lee is excellent in explaining every position and transitioning from one to the next. The setting is also beautiful and creates a great atmosphere. He warms you up nicely and moves into warrior and the other positions like triangle and side stretch, then to warrior one and harder ones like half moon and warrior three. Then he moves you to the floor with arrow and then into back bends. He then transitions to a nice cool down and relaxation. Its a great work out. For sure one of my favorites that I will have and use for a long time."
1,power yoga by rodney yee,I was very disappointed - this is an excellent video but does not play at all on my blu-ray DVD player. I have to play it on my computer and it is very inconvenient to work out in that way.
1,What a brain workout. I haven't touched it!!!,"You have to watch the video for an hour a few times before actually doing the yoga so I haven't even started this video. Instead go with Denise Austin. She may be annoying at times but her yoga videos are the best. Try Yoga Plus with Denise Austin. It combines yoga, pilates and arm weights so you get nice and toned."
2,Mixed review,"I've been doing yoga for about 4 years primarily for the stretching and strength needed because I am a runner. I was using recorded David Ross Inhale episodes on Oxygen tv) - which i really liked, but thought I'd try something new. Bought this and 2 others by D Yee, and I'm not quite as impressed as I thought I would be based on the reviews. I am by no means a yoga expert, but I feel like he goes way too fast and doesn't allow much time for sufficient strength and stretching...especially if this is supposed to be for beginners (which I thought I was, but i found this workout to be fairly easy, so maybe I'm a bit more advanced than I thought). All in all, I suppose if you've never done yoga, this might be fine as a first step, but you'd have to really pay attention - or keep your remote handy to pause! - to be able to keep up. More advanced people - look for something else."
2,just ok,"did not enjoy this dvd. i have his ""am yoga"" dvd and enjoy that so much better. this one is just ""blah"" and some of the poses don't seem to flow. this dvd, like his flexibility, cd is too rushed."
4,"Excellent, not for beginners","Just a great vinyasa workout for those who have atleast 6 months practice behind them. Calm narrator voice and beautiful backdrop. Goes through a few sun salutations and then some basic yoga moves like warrior 3, triangle pose, etc. My practice is usually 1 1/2 hours, so there seems to be something missing on this video- inverted poses. I wouldnt recommend for beginners, since there is no instruction on how to do individual poses."
5,Another great Rodney DVD.,I am fairly new to yoga but I have been practicing frequently and I really like this DVD. I feel it is at the intermediate level and still can challenge the user to an even higher level of yoga. I love the beautiful Hawian setting and I also like that Rodney doesn't talk too much. I am also a fan of his Yoga Burn DVD. I like a workout not just meditation and Rodney works you just enough. His workouts remain engaging without getting boring to soon.
2,Disappointing,"I have the am/pm yoga video and really love it. I wanted something on DVD and went with this one because it had such great reviews. I was disappointed-the moves are very repetitive, I felt like I did one move over and over again for ten minutes. I did feel like it was a good workout, but was bored. I wish there was more variety in the moves. Other than that, I think Rodney Yee is great, and it was worth a try, but I don't think I'll be doing this workout too often."
3,"A good supplement to a library, but you will need more","This is a very good workout but it has its limits. The routine is fairly long, and although there are chapters on the DVD, it is difficult to start from anywhere other than the slow-building sun salutation, which warms you up. There is not much diversity of poses, so even though the warrior variations are intense, I often hesitate to put in this video because I think of it as boring and redundant. If you are buying a few yoga DVDs, this is a good one for your library, but if you are looking to start with just one or two, this might not be enough."
5,Great Hour workout,This DVD workout encompasses everything I'm looking for in a yoga workout as both a flexibility and endurance workout. I would recommend this DVD for anyone looking to do Yoga at home and still get a great workout for the price of less than one real class.
4,Not 5 stars ONLY because...,"I really love this DVD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the mention of arm balances, and it turned out that there were none. Or maybe there were, but none that I consider to be arm balances... Anyway, I have been doing yoga off and on for about a year. Each time I stop and start, I can pretty much get back into it without a problem. I do the MTV Yoga DVD (which is also awesome; check it out). Rodney Yee's Power Yoga is definitely faster than any yoga I have ever done, and I love that. I was looking for Power Yoga and I found it. I don't know if someone who is exceptionally advanced would benefit from this DVD, but for the intermediate level it's a gem. By the way, the backbends are crazy!...but in a good way:) You'll be sore the next day, but if you keep it up, you'll be toned and strong in a very short amount of time."
1,What a god-awful piece of garbage,The writing is just trashy and terrible - the descriptions of the sex scenes are hilariously awful. I have no idea why such a big deal was made over this.
1,Not the same product,I've been getting my bikini area waxed for some time now by a wonderful lady who sold me this product over a year ago. I bought 2 bottles from her and they both lasted 6-8 months and really worked when used twice a day. i haven't had a chance to schedule another appt with her but i needed a refill on this Prince Reign product. It was $60 on their website and the salon had sold it to me for $40. I then found it here for $30 and decided to order instead of making the trip to the salon. I just got it in the mail today and it is NOT the same product. The real stuff is a light green [...] and the bottle is sealed. The stuff i got from here is a very dark green color and the top is a screw top. It looks just like the color of my aloe vera bottle and smells the same. It is also very sticky when it dries and the real stuff is not at all sticky and has a very light scent. DO NOT BUY this - it's just an expensive bottle of aloe vera...i want my money back and will be trying to return.
3,Smells good!,"I've used princereigns for about 3 weeks now and find it leaves my face rejuvenated after a shave. Although It helps somewhat with the ingrown hairs and razor bumps, i think its more of a skin conditioner. I had better luck using Tendskin or Kalo for ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Has a nice smell too."
4,Awesome!,"Ignore that guy who posted that ""Soft Link Mats are better"" He doesn't know what he's talkign about. These mats come with ALL the borders you need and are plenty thick. I'm using them in my weight room. They will dent if you put a tredmill or HEAVY weight on them for a long period of time, but they do a good job at protecting my hardwood floor. You can't DROP weights on it as it will cut into the mat, but for stacking plates or using a bench or putting your curlbar, straight bar etc down, it's perfect. I dead lift 350lb and put it back on the floor with no problems. Easy to clean, very soft and very cheap per square foot. Make sure you order enough, I ordered the 96sq package and needed ONE more package to finish my gym, so i had to pay additional shipping for the 24sq ft package. Not as robust as rubber gym matts (which cost 5 times the price) but a very good compromise."
5,Great billiard book for all skill levels,"A former city of Cincinnati, College and military Amateur Champion, I've spent a good part of my life walking around a pool table. And I've played all the important games from One-Pocket and Bank Pool to Nine Ball and Straight Pool. More recently, and in semi-retirement, I decided try and take my game to a new level. That meant learning a few new tricks. There's no other author on the game of pocket billiards who knows more tricks than Robert Byrne. If you think you have a good handle on the sport, think again. You are guaranteed to advance your game if you follow the tips in Byrne's book. Now I know why he's in the Billiard Congress Hall of Fame. Now I've got to go practice what I've learned..."
5,satistied,"Really good!delivery was okayand the book was in good condition.satistfied with the order ~but the only sad part was that I bought a wrong bookhowever, when i looked through it,it seemed like a good book to study !"
4,Just what I expected,"The book that I recieved what in the exact quality that it was listed to be in. I was a little disappointed in the amount of time that it took to get the book compared to other companies I have worked with on Amazon, but I understand it might not be the companies fault."
1,A dud,"I purchased this system several years ago to use in an emergency...of course. Well, nothing on it every worked. The inflator makes the sound but it does not pump air...also the built in gauge doesn't work. I recently tried to jumpstart my car in an emergency, of course, it didnt work. I dont think Coleman makes this anymore but if you see one for sale, dont buy it."
1,bunch of junk.,"I received the PMJ8160 for a father's day present and have used it for running a 7 watt fan all night long on a camping trip. It worked well for that, but with hurricane gustav, I really needed some power and needed to power my internet modem so I could connect with work and family/friends to let them know I was okay... the modem only uses 13 watts; thus at 18 amp hours one would think that I would get from 12 - 13 hours out of it. I got a little over 2...Today, I had a dead battery in my Toyota Sienna and tried to start it with a fully charged PMJ8160...nothing. I am rather dissapointed in this product and really cannot recommend it to anyone...go to Harbor Freight and get the Chicago Electric version for a lot less..."
1,Did not help me,I wish I could say the book helped it did not. Maybe I am not a good patient. But I got a hearing aid from house clinic that did help but now the other ear is a problem.
2,SAME OLD LINE,"Had high hopes when ordering this book that it would help me cope with or even correct my tinnitus. All it did was tell me the same old thing, ""It's in your head and you need to stop thinking about it and live with it."" By the time I finished reading it, I was more pessimistic and hopeless concerning my condition.I have recently ordered another book from Amazon, ""Tinnitus Retraining Therapy"" by Dr. Pawel Jastreboff, and hope this will help me. I'll review it after reading it. This doctor supposedly helped William Shatner (according to W.Shatner's book) in his battle with tinnitus."
1,No Help For Me,This book had nothing to do with my tinnitus. I don't know who the author was talking about. I have had tinnitus for 50 years and it is very real. No amount of will power or witch doctoring will make it go away.
3,A bit blurry but not all bad,"The title tells you what to expect. The women are sometimes just topless and sometimes completely naked. Sometimes a girl is fully naked in real public places, sometimes just in kind-of public places. Most of the nudity is more or less tasteful, but on a few occasions you see some leg-spreading and/or zooming in on intimate parts. I personally think these views could have been left out as it makes the whole thing more sleazy. It's more of a thrill when just showing full frontal views of a woman attracting attention in a crowd.BE AWARE that the picture quality is often pretty poor. A bit blurry and sometimes even a bit shaky. These movies are obviously filmed by whoever just happened to have their own hand-camera with them (this was made in 1996 before personal cameras were any good). This was still worth watching I guess, but I long for the day when someone's going to make a DVD using the full potential of this interesting idea."
4,more a travel book than a literary work,"The pictures were very lovely, but since I didn't read the description of what I was purchasing, I expected a work of literature. It was a nice book to flip through the pages, I did enjoy it."
4,Wonderful Fantasy,"The Golden Compass is a wonderful fantasy story. It takes place in England when Lyra's uncle (father) returns from an expedition from the north. She then is brought to her mother's residence and learns what is happening in the north. Homeless children are being taken and seperated from their daemons (somewhat like a lifelong companion). With these experiments they are trying and bring the dimensions of the worlds together. Which are being seperated by the dust in the northern lights. She goes off on a dangerous adventure with gypses and armored bears to try and stop her parents who are the leaders of the experiments. Along the way they restore the rightful armored bears leader, which was their companion. They reach the northern lights and her Father (Uncle in the beginning) and her mother which was the leader of these experiments, go through the lights and they follow them through which leads on to the next book."
4,"Good...not great, but good","The 'His Dark Materials' trilogy is an entertaining read, not as good as the Harry Potter series nor the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, but better (in my opinion) than the chronicals on narnia. It is a coming of age story that concentrates on two adolescent protagonists coming to terms with the changing world around them. It is set in a multiverse which combines several fantasy realities with our own. The writing is tedious at times, but overall the story does flow and comes together in the end. There is no doubt to any reader that Phillip Pullman has no love for established religion, so if you are put off by opinions that don't fall in line with Christianity, I suggest not reading these books. I do caution parents, this is a dark storyline and (again, in my opinion) is not appropriate for younger children. Otherwise, enjoy."
2,SO disappointing,"I absolutely love fantasy (usually) but was incredibly let down by this series. The first book was wonderful. I immediately bought the next two- and hated them. I love reading about other worlds, and the daemon idea is great, but I didn't like that some characters died (main ones) and others crossed over in my world (drinking coke, riding in cars, etc.) And the first book paid a lot of attention to character development, while the next two were incredibly rushed and hurried feeling, with confusing, badly-laid out, not-well-described worlds and religious theories. Plus, after the first one, the humor just disappears. Just goes away entirely. I read this series, and the reviews of it, with great excitement, but I was completely uninspired by it. If you like fantasy, other worlds, young children going toward their destinies, and, for god's sake, good character development and humor, buy something by David Eddings. (...)"
2,His Dark Materials Trilogy,"A fun read. Not as intricate or engrossing as Lord of the Rings,but enjoyable."
3,Okay,"I read these books and I thought they were pretty good. They would never replace Artemis Fowl or some of my other many favorites, but they were good enough for me to read the whole trilogy. If you liked these or if you were lukewarm to it like me, try Garth Nix. He's good."
3,Good enough,"In spite of lovely writing and interesting characters, I think this trilogy does not match the excitement and color of the Harry Potter series. Pullman is a great writer, but he is lacking in JK Rowling's special gifts of humor, excellent secondary characters, and roller-coaster plotting.In fact, Pullman's plotting is plodding. The third book was, for me, about 100 pages too long.I don't believe this is a dangerous book for young people, but perhaps most who have limited time for reading will pick something else. Pullman's criticisms of organized religion ring a bell at times, but the pathetic creature who is killed in book 3 definitely is not most people's idea of God the Father, Son or Holy Spirit."
1,Atheist Propaganda,"Pullman is an excellent storyteller, and you don't pick up on his plan until the 3rd book, the Amber Spyglass, when he reveals the God is a liar and did not create the universe. Pullman is a self-declared atheist and calls his books the ""anti-Narnia"". Just be warned!"
4,ageless,"These are books for all ages. I remember tying to find the third book in this series and the Librarian giving me a funny look while saying ""you know its in the juvenile section."" Maybe this was written for children, but it isn't exactly Dr. Suess either. I might be 27 but I enjoyed these books immensily. It took me away to a magical world and a journey of emotions that few books have. I intend to read these stories to my daughter when she is old enough to understand them. I would recommend this book to anyone 8 years old to 100 years old."
5,Great interesting series...,"The Golden Compass has been made into a movie but reading the words helps you ""see"" what the director missed or had to shunt in a different direction. The other books in the series are as interesting as the first book. All the books of the trilogy are good reads for adults and younger readers."
5,Trilogy fantastic read,"Dark Materials great fantasy read...unconventional, great characters, and quite a bit of sci-fi mixed in with the magic"
1,Not for children or young adults,"This series is the anti-Narnia. Research this author and his beliefs before buying this. This book may be fine for adults to read, but impressionable young people should not read it without adult supervision. Thankfully, I was warned ahead of time and researched this author before my children had a chance to read it."
2,dark materials trilogy,"I feel like I've been mugged. Seriously, these books were a scandal, and they have caused me pain that I never want to feel again. I will admit that I wanted Will and Lyra to fall in love, but not 50 pages too soon. Such a struggle to read through... such agony... By the end of this saga, I didn't care. I had trouble remembering why I loved The Golden Compass. I have forgotten the mastery of The Subtle Knife. Indifference. pure horrible indifference. The worst pain of all!"
5,great books,"these were great books. i read it before Harry Potter, and it was no comparison; this book is awesome. ypou leanrn about Lyra, who never fits in at Oxford. then is swept into politics by Ms. Coulter, the leader of an experament which is based on ripping childrens daemons, their souls, away from them. with Pan, her daemon, Lyra experiances betrayal, and love when she meets Will, who is from another world. this was an awesome series, and i could not put any one of the books down. accompinied by mary, thwe scientist, will, the murderer, and others, Lyra Silvertonge sets out to save dust, and ends up saving the world, as Eve."
3,Golden compass=northern lights,it was not a nice surprise that I have 2 books that have same intend but differant name.
4,An enjoyable new kind of fantasy,"A thoroughly enjoyable story. The worlds that the author spins are quite an interesting mix of our real world, our religious myths, and new worlds. You won't find any old elves and trolls. I really enjoyed being immersed in these worlds.The trilogy is best read as such. I found that I had way too many unanswered questions at the end of book one. But, and this is important, I couldn't wait to get those questions answered! More is revealed in book 2, and of course it all comes together in the final. Excellent craftsmanship of a trilogy!As to the story itself, I found it to be a very interesting mix of sci-fi theories of multiple worlds and an exciting twist on some of our religious myths."
3,Well-written but should not be a default choice for fans of other such literature,"It's actually been several years since I read this trilogy so my remembrance of the details is fuzzy, but I'm just here to share two overall impressions that stuck with me. First, Pullman is a gifted writer who has great mastery of the language, which I always appreciate. But by the end of the third book, I was mainly sad that someone with his talents had used them in a way that I personally found offensive. It also troubled me that these books would be a natural thing for children to pick up, and the way the offensive material builds slowly over the later books meant that they would already be into the story before it became really troubling. Parts of the third book struck me as nothing more than a sophisticated anti-God rant. That's obviously not going to bother some people, but it was enough to make me get rid of these books and not re-read them as I have with other great series that I've enjoyed."
5,A Breathtaking Creation,"I do not believe that it is possible to better His Dark Materials as a trilogy - as anything. I have never been so engrossed and enraptured by a work of fiction as this - it is a perfect whole, many layered and complex. Intellectually challenging, stimulating and rewarding but also humanly engaging. Will and Lyra and most of all Mrs Coulter are breathtaking literary creations. Some books flare in a burst of publicity and then age and fade away, I think that these three will grow and grow - what a way to start a century! Masterful. His Dark Materials defies categorisation - to see them as childrens books or cross-over books is a nonsense. They are books for everyone and anyone. Read them and weep."
1,His Dark Materials Trilogy,"I am agnostic and not a religious person. However, these three novels are anti-christian and anti-catholic in particular. They substitute another religion in place of Christianity. They deal with organized religion as an absolute evil.The stories are not nearly as well written as the Harry Potter novels. The universes they portray are dark ones. The title of the trilogy: ""His Dark Materials"" is a fitting one."
4,BEST!,"These books, all 3, are really captivating. I admit, to me, the first in the series (the golden compass) isn't as great as the rest. You have to be totally focussed on the reading, because the plot twists and the developments can confuse you otherwise.Favorite series for life!"
4,Very good.,"The first book was the best of the 3, but you definitely need to read them all in order to get the full picture. The story is a bit confusing at times because of its complexity (in a good way)."
5,Absolutely fantastic,Absolutely fantastic. I wish they would do all the movies of the series. The last book gives an incredible closing to the whole saga and the way they explain the need and history of religion is amazing. Loved the whole set.
5,Awesome and Epic but not for everyone!,"This trilogy is incredible, no doubt about it, with well developed and dynamic characters, amazing action and incredible world development. It is everything I look for in a fantasy. For me it gets five stars hands down, but I just want to caution other readers that there is some heavily religious subject matter and some readers may find it upsetting or unsettling. Also, I would not read this to a six year old as a bedtime story. Some of the events in the trilogy might disturb younger children so I would keep it strictly young adult to adult, even if your little one is capable of reading at this level. Still, it is a wonderful read and I am looking forward to seeing how it plays out in film."
4,Good children's fantasy series written for adults,"I would not expect to see this fantasy series on a recommended reading list put out by the Catholic Church. He is clearly not a fan of heroically/autocratic religious organizations.The book chronicles the actions and adventures of a young girl and her friends against a corrupted, power hungry ""church"". The characters are well developed and seem ""alive"" in every sense, including the non-human ones. The book holds together well. There is a lot of action, good dialog, suspense, etc., everything that makes for a good read.I would have given the series a 5 star rating, but I was not satisfied with the ending, although some may disagree.All humans in Phillip Pullman' universe have a ""daemon"" spiritually attached to them, that is a reflection of that humans soul. The daemon can take many shapes when the human is young, but as the human matures into an adult, the daemon takes its permanent form."
3,Promising first book with an ideological nag at the end.,"What Phillip Pullman has managed to do is create an enticing first book which leads you into the second and third without fully understanding what his views are. As a non-Catholic Christian, I find much of Pullman's ideas plain wrong or illogical. The books are interesting, but pretty much just a sounding board for Pullman's anti-Christian Views."
4,enticing,"The story was wonderfully exciting with fantasy that thrilled my mind and kept me wanting more and wondering what was going to happen next. The characters were interesting, the plot lovely. However it is contraversial to those of us who are christian, however it is a wonderful story."
1,I've tried repeatedly to read this book,"Until tonight, I was insulated completely from the whole debate on religion, so that hasn't been a factor (I'm woefully deficient in reading Hollywood gossip and watching sensationalist news programs, it seems). I bought the first book at least 4 years ago and have made at least 3 attempts at reading it, most recently after moving and finding the thing in a box. It's just no good--I can't manage to hack through it. The prose is thick and the plot so well-hidden I haven't managed yet to discern what the book is supposed to be about or which direction it's heading. I'm 40-some, childless, and a big fan of Tolkien, Asimov, Clarke, CJ Cherryh, Frank Herbert, Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. LeGuin, Piers Anthony, Poul Anderson, etc. etc. so I've read a fair few SF/Fantasy works. I just haven't read this one...and it's not for lack of trying."
1,TERRIBLE,"The Golden Compass book and movie were both beautiful, but with an underlying dark message that quickly evolves into absolutely nonsensical confused trash. The message of this series is so odd and dark I felt like I wasted not only my money buying the books, but more importantly, my time reading them."
3,disappointing after great start,"I read the trilogy after reading glowing reviews. The first book lived up to the hype, but from the midpoint of The Subtle Knife through the end of Amber Spyglass I became increasingly disappointed. I finished the trilogy only because I'd already invested so much time, and hoped for improvement. Pullman is a master of imagery and phrase, but certainly not of plot development. There seems to be no internal consistency or coherence to the story, and at the end I'm left wondering why they were written: there is a battle, yes, but for what? The resolution of the conflict leads the characters back to where they were at the start of the story, with no real change in their lives. I get the impression that Pullman set out to rival Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings and Lewis' Narnia Chronicles. He fails miserably."
1,Slopjar Politics,"Pure drivel, just like 98% of everything else that makes it to the bestseller list these days. But in defense to Mr. Pullman, he is not the one wasting our time. Only we are to blame for that."
2,An unenjoyable mishmash,"I bought this trilogy after it kept coming up in my Amazon recommendations. So many people had written rave reviews; I thought I'd really enjoy the series. Instead, I got a rambling mess, with overtones of Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, Richard Adams' Shardik, Lord of the Flies, folklore, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, and every sub-par parallel worlds episode that Star Trek ever made. The characters aren't consistent from one book to the next. Plotlines are abandoned without a trace. And the writing is dull and unevocative. I'll give it two stars for a few interesting ideas and the fact that I managed to get through it, but I certainbly wouldn't recommend this to anyone. You'll be seeing my set on [website] soon."
2,A decent try,"Pullman presents the reader with an alternative view of the metaphysical and physical. God, spirit, soul, matter. He's got some nice ideas and makes a decent effort to explore and develop them, but in the end it's lacking in credibility. I mean, a story's got to posess an inner credibility, an inner logic. Here, Pullman's story has too many flaws. Reading the pages, I give up trying to believe in his universe(s) and the last book became purely a ""make it through""-run. But OK - apart from serious faults in fundamentals, Mr. Pullman has a good command over language and scenery. He writes well, and has a nice imagination. I'll give him that. Some reflecting on the art of storytelling, and Pullman will be a winner."
3,His Dark Materials Trilogy all three books,"The story is fun to read, however I would not recommend these books for young children. He has no reguard for Christian values calling God easy to fool and probably isn't even alive. If you are secure in your Christian faith you can see through his facade."
1,Children's Book?,"I am an avid reader, and I love fantasy and children's literature, but what is up with everyone loving these books? I was looking forward to reading The Golden Compass, only to be completely disapointed within a few pages of starting it. I found it to be almost disturbing in its weirdness, and I honestly do not know a child, even an older well-read child, that would be able to read these books without confusion and with a genuine interest in finishing the trilogy. I managed to finish the first book, but had no interest in pursuing the trilogy further, and I was honestly left with a bad vibe from having read The Golden Compass. After reading the comments from the author about his purpose for writing the book, I can understand why I do not like it. What happened to writing children's books with the intent to entertain children with harmless, light-heartedness? I will stick with Harry Potter and Chronicles of Narnia thank you!!!"
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"When my children were younger, I would pre-read books before giving them. I was entranced by the golden compass - and then I read the next book and was horrified. These books are not for children! I don't mind if people want to air their anti-Christian, anti-any religion views in adult books but THEY SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO SELL THEIR VIEWS TO CHILDREN. That is just sick. Besides, the second book stunk. Hopefully, the movie sanitized the anti-Christian views."
4,Better than the movies,His Dark Materials trilogy was a fun series of books to read. Unfortunately the movie didnt do as well when it released in the US since the producers decided to dance around the Church references and trying to create a movie for all to see. Personally if they stayed true to the book I would have liked it better. I guess if Star Wars were to come out today they would have to rethink the use of the Force and what the Force was. The books themselves I liked because they were a compromise between paperback and hardcovers... A softcover with larger text than in paperbacks. The story is a fast read and I would imagine that all the people who liked the Harry Potter series would also enjoy this one.
4,My wife enjoyed them.,"The seller was very accurate and considerate about their product and shipping.I purchased these for my wife (I will be reading them soon), and she thoroughly enjoyed them. She did comment that she'd be surprised if the other movies ever get made simply because there are a lot of sensitive topics."
2,Not what I expected,Just wasn't what I had excepted. There really wasn't a good job in explaining what was going on. Wasn't really that impressed.
1,Definitely not for children!,"These books are about the destruction of God. If that's what you want your children reading, borrow them from the library. Do NOT waste your money on these. I don't believe in outright censorship, but these books should be listed for adults, not children 9-12. Shame on Amazon. Anything for a dollar."
5,His Dark Materials Trilogy,"His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)I bought this as a new set and received exactly what was advertised. I've only read the first book as of yet, but must say the book was WAY BETTER than the movie. Can't wait to read the remaining two. [...]"
3,Not as great as I expected,"After reading Pullman's obituary, I became interested in reading one of his many books. I picked the trilogy, since it had won several awards and the story looked interesting. I am an avid reader and normally plough through books, but I really had a hard time getting engrossed in this one. I'm not sure whether it's the writing or the character - the main character didn't do too much for me. I felt a little bit disappointed by not feeling completely wrapped up by the story, but I think teen readers would enjoy it nonetheless. I ended up giving my boxed set to my friend's son, who is 11, and he really enjoyed it."
3,His Dark Materials Trilogy,Arrived in a nicely packaged box. Surprising good read. Would have prefer the wordings to be in a bigger font... ah well.
1,The Golden Compass,The plot was extremely slow to develop. The author seemed particularly reticent to explain dramatic events in the narrative. I was bored even before the adventure began.
5,It's as full of bliss as its name.,"I was so delighted to read The Business of Bliss . It has all the beauty and flair of Victoria magazine's photography with something more permanent and timeless in hardcover. Also, like the magazine, it is truly inspiring. We do not often realize that we could dedicate our livelihoods to something we adore, because all around us seems to indicate otherwise. This book tells the truth and encourages those with beautiful ideas to develop them into something realistic. It is a wonderful, fulfilling, and enlightening experience."
5,A beautiful book on how to turn your passion into a biz!,The Business of Bliss is a beautifully done book featuring many inspirational chapters of how more than 30 women have turned their passions into successful businesses. Beautiful photographs and a very thorough listing of resources with address information for all the businesses featured. It definitely inspired me to follow my dreams!
3,really funny,this movie was funny not scary you actually think a snow man will scare somebody but it made a great comedien effort but this movie was good really for its comedy not horror.
5,mostly for fullmoon fans...but great!,"okay to be honest i was kinda disapointed,the movie was a blury film.to be more specific it was filmed in digital, but who cares it was a good movie.the story goes like this,a theripist talks sam(chris allport)into showing them his stash of anti-freeze(wich contains jack the chilla killa)so they experiment with it(for some reason they keep failing the tests)but finally jack wakes up and smells the coffee(you'll see what i mean...when you watch it!)and wakes up at a tropical island!where sam and his friends are vacatoining at.i'll leave it to you to figure out the rest,but i will say this,this disc has some decent features!when you select somethin jack face will start changing,comes with 4 trailers,a hilarious music video,footage of off-screen/on-screen stuff,a live interview,spanish subtitles,& a perfect scene index what else can you ask for!also some added characters and buckets of gore!"
3,Better and Worse Than the First Movie.,"This movie is both better and worse than the first, which ispretty darn hard to accomplish. On the one hand, this movie is morefun over all, and I actually enjoyed watching the whole thing as aguilty pleasure (don't expect great acting, folks!). On the otherhand, the kill scenes on the whole are not nearly as memorable. It isstill a cult classic, but not nearly as much as the first was. Oh,and there IS nudity in this film (a pretty long scene with it, infact). There's no ""snowman rape scene"" like some peoplewould like, but the first one didn't actually HAVE nudity in it,either. Weird."
1,Entire movie made with a cheap home camcorder,"The film quality is horrible. The movie istelf is twice as horrible. Its even worst than part one.Remember the bath tub sceen from part one. Well there is absolutely nothing as funny as that in part two. Rent this movie if you must, but don't buy it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Unless you're in the top 20% income level this book won't help you diddly. It talks of going around the world, a bunch, about sailing around the world, taking adventures, going to adult camps. And a virtual yellow pages for websites to accomplish this. The stories from people interviewed are from the top 20% also. It was a waste of my money and in-between the stories the information was just plain common sense. I had really waited anxiously for this book to be published, too bad it's such a dud."
4,That Sasha CD Sound,"I have noticed what seems to be a trend in Sasha's newer CDs. That is, most of the original tracks have faster tempos than he records them at. But, they dont sound pitched way down - I assume they are put thru a pitch-shifting alg like I have in my sampler. It's not bad most of the time, but it can be bad - compare the original on the Light 'Expand the Room' on Expeditions. In any event all these newer CDs - Expeditions, SF, Ibiza, have a distinct pitch-shifted sound. I dont want to mess with anybodys trip, but it is a different sound. When Renaissance/NE first came out the tracks were around 124/128 (bpm) and the CDs were recorded around that tempo. Why are Sash's new CDs stuck at 130 when the rest of the trance world (his track selection) is @ 135? When I saw him at Twilo last it didn't sound funny. People would still buy these CDs, they just wouldn't be quite so palatable for newbies. His stuff is so subtle anyway. Anyone else?"
4,Not as good as San Francisco,"Yet its still original mixes from none other than the lord of trance SASHA. Cd1 is very slow, I didn't like it much. But Cd2 is where Sasha does his magic. I was about to give it 3 stars if he hadn't included a nearly 10 minute version of Xpander which is I think the number 1 music track from Sasha. Go pick this one up if you already got the San Francisco one. I can't wait for the next Global Underground Series from Sasha"
4,TRANCE LOVERS AND PRODUCERS IN PROGRESS,"i THINK THAT THIS TRANCE ALBUM IS REAL GREATAND WHOEVER HASN'T DICOVERED THE ART OF MAKING TRANCE MUSIC BETTER DO IT BY LISTENING OR BUYING THIS ALBUM. PERSONALY I LOVE TRANCE AND HOPEFULLY WILL TRY TO PRODUCE TRANCE MUSIC SO ALL YOU PEOPLE WILL HEAR OF ME ""MY TRANCE PRODUCING NAME IS CAPONE"". THANKYOU FOR READING"
5,This is the best Trance CD that I have ever heard! 6 stars!,"I love this cd soooo much! Both CDs are very well done, he is truly a master. This was my first Global Underground CD that I bought and it totally blew away all of my past and present Trance CDs. His other one in this series labeled Global Underground: San Francisco, is also excellent. It is not as good as this one, but it is worth getting also. I was not really a big fan of Sasha when he was with Digweed, I did not really care much for their early work, and since then it seems like Digweed has got worse and Sasha has became the master."
1,"Luckily this product is discontinued, too bad the maker still exists","Impossible to change the battery. Planed obsolescence, and conscious manufacturing so as to created waste."
2,Two Years Old and Fading,"Some of the tracks are fun, but they all are from the in/famous 1998 season and while Vikings fans can appreciate the little tributes to Randy Moss (The Rookie) and Cris Carter (The Legend), all the references to Cunningham make it sound quite dated.But what really makes this album a hack job is that the songs are just random ""jock jams"" and have nothing to do with the Vikings. Where are ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" ""Hells Bells,"" and the other tracks played regularly at the Metrodome? and why is ""YMCA"" on here? They need to cut a Culpepper era CD with songs that are really part of the Vikings experience."
1,Was good until it got religious,"I was enjoying this book as an easy, fun read even though it was not totally capturing my attention, until a third of the way through it suddenly got religious. The characters all started talking about their faith in God, etc. It was literally every other sentence. I had no idea this was a ""Christian"" novel or I wouldn't have started reading it. Good thing I got it for free. I am surprised that the author waited until almost the middle to start preaching. I really didn't see that coming. Definitely not going to finish it and deleted it from my device. Unless you are into reading a novel that kind of tricks you into reading it only to then try to preach to you, don't bother."
2,A Disappointment,"The beginning chapter provided this book the potential to be a page turning thriller. Unfortunately, the reader had to plod through various points of view while the multitude of protagonists and antagonists rationalized every decision and action. If you enjoy soap operas, this book is for you."
1,Worldly book for believers,"I have to wonder who this book was written for. I doubt that a secular audience would tolerate the focus on the spiritual development of the characters. And I would hope that many Christians would have a problem with the moral standards of the book. The attraction between the main characters is mostly animal, from beginning to end. The plot, while twisty and well executed, is pure soap opera with all the ugliness of daytime TV. So, if you are not a devoted believer in Christ, you might be warned: some of the resolution in this book involves repentance and characters coming to trust God more fully. Believers, if you want wholehearted purity, you will not find it here. I guess if you are used to TV standards it probably seems tame. But I would sure hate for my teens to think that it is okay to spend the night with the person you are dating, or tell them you want to have sex with them, etc. I am sorry to have read this book."
3,Tolerable if you can get past the first few chapters,"Freefall is a mediocre novel and while enjoyable in many spots is predictable and a bit choppy. The first few chapters are difficult to get through and while the characters are sometimes inconsistent and forced, for a low price, it is overall a decent book. Not a ""can't put it down"" read but great for light summer entertainment."
2,Great Dish - Horrible Delivery,"The dish hasn't arrived yet, but I know I will always remember how much the company Original Good took advantage of me.Some shipping charges are steep, but Original Goods charges are egregious. Original Good has a shipping charge 3 times the cost of the product!The only reason I had to purchase this product is for a friend who is sick in the hospital. She loves frogs.c"
2,hardcooooooooore!!!!!!,"I read some of this book in an American Civilization class at Brown University my junior year of college. It was the most difficult reading on the syllabus. Most of it went right over my head. It may be a useful tool for Marxists or others interested in class equality. Still, if you think Foucault is difficult reading, then you will REALLY be challenged by this. You may want to have at least 10 years in grad school or have 2 or 3 Ph.D.'s to get this. This book is for the academics' academics' academic. It is very hardcore, so be warned!"
4,Great book on Revival,surely this book is very powerful and it is an urgent and poweful message that the church should read.
3,Good,"Nice little holder, POD fits pretty easily and if mounted on a mic stand, it can pretty handy. The only flaw, which is a big one, is the little rubber bullets the hold the pod don't fit that well into the metal holder and you will lose em if your not careful, they will come off every time you take your POD off."
2,Great content ! Less than great presentation,"In summary I found it not user friendly, the photos are not related to the recipes. While Dominican cuisine is one of the best kept secrets in the Caribbean and worthy of discovery this book does not help. Something less fancy and more user friendly would have helped!"
5,David Phelps,"David Phelps has the greatest voice I've ever heard in my life. This cd is classic David Phelps. He has the most vocal flexibility, range, intonation, and resonance combined than any other singer."
5,Incredible,"This CD is a great buy, and includes 3 great remixes, the first of which is the best. Junior's tribal workout is a journey through several nasty tribal beats, each of which makes the song nastier. Also, check out Peter Rauhofer's remix, which, aside from Junior's, is probably my favorite.X'99 is Junior's finest production in my opinion, and it is a must for any true house head's cd booklet."
4,"Some effort to install, but it is slick","After some effort, I was able to install Mandrake 8.2. Once it is upand running it is really slick. A few things did not work, like Xsanefor my epson 1240U scanner. Other than that it was capatible with everythingelse that I had hooked to my computer. It even had a slick j-pilotapplication for syncing my palm pilot."
5,I won't ride at night without my down low glow,"Side visibility is key when you are riding at night. These lightweight, durable lights provide side visibility unlike any other light that I've used. They are also very cool looking. If you have kids they will love to ride with them at night, and you'll feel better knowing that they are much easier now for drivers to see them. If you are into show bikes or party bikes, you gotta have at least one pair of these on your bike. You will literally, 'Ride Like A Rock Star' as the advertisements say.Down Low Glow Lighting Kit - Single Tube - Envy(green)"
4,Beautiful but somehow unsatisfying,A beautifully written book with elegantly drawn characters from a different time and place. My only complaint (and please forgive me if I'm showing my simplicity) is that the question left hanging in the air left me feeling somewhat let down.
4,History of the career of Pontius Pilate,"Paul Maier does an excellent job in this historical novel of being true to the facts where they are available, and being believably fictional in places where there are no facts available. This book traces the career of Pontius Pilate in Roman administration, his prefecture in Judea before, during, and after Christ. Highly researched and with full reference notes. I think the book is more guided to the student of history than of religion, but it will fit on both shelves."
5,Mr. Plummer is a wonderful writer and well worth reading.,Good to read even if you do not plan to hunt rats with your terrier. It helped me to understand a lot about terrier behavior. Mr. Plummer has a delightful sense of humor.
2,Hmmmm,"The first five tracks on this CD contain some of the finest keyboard playing I've ever heard. However, it's a bit downhill after that. The keyboard player should stop wasting his time and find himself a nice It Bites tribute band"
4,A good read,"I was so excited to read this book it's definatley a good read, but my book started falling apart the first day I got it and that really pissed me off ...WTF!!!"
4,Works well,This integrated seamlessly into my old linksys router. Easy set up and good online documentation. It does not have as great a range as I expected. I am in an old 3 story house (plaster walls). It did not reach from the third floor to the first floor (as I hoped it would). Hard wired to the 2nd floor it has good range througout the house and through brick walls into the back yard. Zero disconnect issues after 2 months of use. (Old linksys with antenna booster sucked).
1,Schaum's misses boat,Wow!!! Schaum's and Noel Everard really missed the boat on this one! I really wish engineers would learn how to write and cohesively put ideas down on paper. Noel's concept of writing is to regurgitate a bunch of formulas that cross reference other formulas. If you are looking for concepts.... this is NOT the book for you.I'm disappointed in Schaum's on this one. After using other outlines of theirs I had higher expectations. This one is really bad! No wonder it only cost 12 bucks.
5,Mr,I have not yet recieved this CD! Others were recieved and thank you.Mashala John Mokgopa0027823368874
4,Spine chilling suspense set to classical music,"Seven symphonies has nail-biting suspense, serial killings, an exotic setting plus a bonus treat of building appreciation for the music in a symphony. Simon Boswell combines the hunt for a spiralling out of control serial killer with the gradual unvieling of the musical life of the great Finnish composer, Sibelius.The plot is a cleverly intertwined production with escalating violence and a frantic pace. The writing style is as clever and captivating as the young characters and the hip Helsinki setting."
2,Less than Blessed,"I possibly would have rated this book a little higher had it not been written by Mitchard. The story line lacks the originality and insight into character of her other work, especially The Deep End of the Ocean and The Most Wanted, and to that extent, it didn't live up to expectations. It's pretty much a standard love the second time round story, except that the protagonist is a good bit older than the new love, resulting in too predictable rocky steps on the relationship pathway. Its strengths if it has any, are more in the secondary character cameos than in the main cast, especially in some members of the lover's Southern family and how they are perceived by the Cape Cod Northerners. Not nearly as engaging of the reader as Mitchard's earlier books, not quite formula driven but at times perilously close. A pleasant but forgettable read is probably a reasonable assessment. Definitely below Mitchard's usual standard"
1,Indescribably Awful.............,"This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.....and I read a lot!!!! I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept getting worse!!!!!None of the characters had any redeeming qualities whatsover....I couldn't stand any of them, and I didn't care what happened to them.I can't believe I spent good time and money on this drivel!!!"
2,Good for a summer saga,"Don't take this book seriously, just enjoy the ride.The main character is egotistic and the drama is predictable, but admit it, its a beach book.I wish the author had hired an editor - I would have been glad to trim it up a bit, and there are some serious inconsistencies that should have been caught.But really, if you want a fat juicy novel to take to the pool, this is fine."
1,A Stupid Book,"I listened to the audio book version. If you think reading it was bad, listening to it was worse. The book was read by the author and her accent is so anoying, I just couldn't stand it. I think if it had been read by someone else I wouldn't have had such negative feelings about the book. Very disapointing work from someone talented enough to write "" The Deep End of the Ocean""."
1,Bye is Better than Buy,"Just about as unlikeable and unlikely a story as I have ever read. Here we have a successful ""woman of independent means"" who is basically bullied into a quickie wedding with a much younger man of uncertain background. Self absorbed, shallow, trite, wordy, boring and entirely too explicit in the ""love scenes."" The author DOES manage to get the controlling, selfish husband down pretty well, but the ""True"" character is quite lame.Say Bye to this one, I certainly would not recommending you Buy it."
2,A book that will waste your time,"Jacquelyn Mitchard's book ""Twelve Times Blessed"" had to be by far one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. It had no real plot to it, it jumped around and talked about nothign but sex scenes, which if it doesn't interest you, dont read this book. I thought it was really weird how she slept with a guy she didn't even know, while her son was out in the car, it's kind of gross if you think about it. I did kind of like how i could relate to her and her roomate, as they were best friends."
2,Bad book goes down the drain,"Jacquelyn Mitchard's, Twelve Times Blessed, has to be the book with the most sex involved. It wasnt very interesting and exciting, infact there was sometimes when i had to put the book down out of disgust. The begining did catch my eye, but then it turns into this big sex novel. I would not suggest for anyone to read this book, it would be a waste of your time"
5,"Great service, boring book",I had to buy this book for a class at the last minute. I was able to get my hands on this and was thankful. I got it quickly. Now I just have been working through it... written by a neuroscience person it is hard to digest.
1,Terrible voice quality and range,"I really liked this phone before I purchased it and during setup. The only minor complain is that the screen doesn't light up when you have a call coming in on call waiting, so you can't see who is calling when it is dark. Now for the major complaints. First, the voice clarity is horrible. There is some static, but worse is the garbling or interference which causes missed syllables. It sounds like the connection is cutting in and out while you're talking. I tried moving the phone around the house but nothing improves this. Second major problem is the range. My old 900mhz and 2.4mhz phones I had allowed me to walk halfway down my block and get reception. I can't even make it to the end of my yard with this phone. This phone is definitely lacking in the two most important areas. It is definitely going back to the store."
1,Many great features and the worst sound quality,"I purchased this phone with two additional handsets. The unit is expandable to more handsets, and it has many great features. However, the sound quality is the worst of any portable or cell phone I have ever used. All callers tell me that I sound as if I was in a tunnel. They all say that either my voice is breaking up or that I'm not clear. Apparently, it goes both ways for I have to strain to hear them, and often I can no understand what they are saying. All three handsets sound equally bad. Relocation of the base unit and/or the handsets does not improve the sound quality."
3,"Nice simple phone, poor battery","I replaced the battery two times and i'm thinking in buying a new phone, i bought this one because i needed a simple wireless phone but the battery is a nightmare, if you want one i'll recommend to look for another that battery life is al least some how improved."
3,I thought it would be better,"Because of the title, I expected some intriguing recipes in this cookbook. I'm not a natural crockpot cook, but a hectic life has driven me to it, so I'm always searching for slow cooker recipes with a gourmet edge. This cookbook did not live up to my admittedly picky standards. I probably have a fifty percent success rate with these recipes - some simply don't have the right melding of flavors while others are bland. Many recipes don't even interest me enough to try. Still, the remaining fifty percent work well. You have to use a cook's eye to discover them.If you can buy only one cookbook for your crockpot, don't make it this one. Still, it might make a good addition to your bookshelf, especially if you are tired of the recipes you already have."
1,Very disappointed in the BHG name!,"NEW flavors??? No, this cookbook is just a tired repeat of every other crockpot cookbook I've read. Boring, boring, boring. Almost zero vegetarian dishes (not counting the desserts). I'll be giving my copy of this away to someone who needs it; I certainly don't.I expected alot more from Better Homes & Gardens."
1,a blank disc -,"received the DVD and was unable to view it - i purchase two DVD's Left Behind II Tribulation Force (not able to play) very disappointed. We did, however, watch the the third movie which is GREAT!!!!"
5,Left Behind 2: tribulation Force,"I was priviledged to view this movie earlier than it's release date thanks to Cloud Ten Pictures, and what can I say but WOW!...In my humble opinion, it is far superior to the original film, ""Left Behind"" in so many ways, set a week after the mass disappearances it concentrates on the lead characters alliance (the self titled: Tribulation Force) and their attempt to expose a very real evil being unleashed on the world we live.It has romance, action and some very realistic faith based scenes, which will melt the hardest hearts, primarily biblically based this film is family friendly and will challenge what we believe.Great acting, outstanding storyline and a must see film all round!... Go out and purchase before they leave the shelves."
3,Angel Scenes,"Casting the angel must have been a hard one! The scene of protecting Ben-Judah and Buck through the guards was not something you would expect an angel to be singing. Angels have their own songs to sing praise to God. I would have thought a psalm would have been more appropriate here.The Two Witnesses costumes are very believeable and sound affects made in their voices sent chills down my spine. The fire breath scene could have been more thought out, though. You'll have to buy the movie to see what happens here...I would like to see better directors in sequential productions with more skill. While this movie will leave you riveted, the level of calibur seen in hollywood productions are still to be attained."
2,At least watchable,"This one was definitely better than Left Behind, but it was still VERY substandard and not a movie to be taken seriously by the mainstream public. Once again, we Christians are accepting a movie that we would NEVER like if we didn't know it was a ""Christian"" film.If you want to see a movie made by Christians that actually has quality, check out Hometown Legend. I was skeptical of that movie because it was executive produced by Jerry Jenkins, author of the Left Behind series, but it proved why he did not support the Left Behind movies. It has fantastic acting, music, cinematography, and has actually been taken seriously by the mainstream and released by Warner Brothers, not just a Christian company. Hometown Legend was the first film made by Christians that actually excited me.I really hope that films made by Christians can improve, but as of now, we're still way behind the curve, and we should demand better."
2,Left Behind II should stay left behind!,I saw Left Behind and Left Behind II. Unfortunately I paid for them. They both should have stayed left behind on the store shelf. I WOULD NOT recommend either of these movies to any one! I will be spending my money on the Apocolypse Series. Much better made and a great story line! If you really want GOOD Christian movies with a backbone (that could go to the theaters) I would recommend that you NOT BUY this movie! Purchase the Apocolypse series with Nick Mancuso and STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES!!!
2,Question.,"I wasn't to happy with this product. I thought they would be blue. I haven't driven with them yet but does anyone know where to actually get BLUE headlights? I heard that if you get a trasnformer put on your headlights it will convert 12v ro 80,000v and give you the BRIGHT BLUE LOOK that most cars with Ultra Blue lights get."
3,The title is misleading,"I couldn't put this book down. Mitchell's accomplishment -- an astonishing history of the down-and-out Bowery bums of the early 20th Century -- just sucks you in, all thanks to a vain, irritating and probably foul-smelling man named Joe Gould.But . . .If I were Joseph Mitchell (I wish I was), I simply would have titled this ""Joe Gould."" Without revealing what the mystery is, I can safely say that it's not difficult to figure out Joe Gould's Secret. You see it coming about a hundred pages ahead of the ""big"" revelation.Which is not to dissuade you from reading this work. Just keep in mind that it's a life, not a mystery."
2,Very little substance,"This book contains many topics important to physicians. However the substance for each topic is minimal. It does give some helpful tips for dealing with each topic it covers, but will certainly not be good as a sole reference on any of the topics. The question and answer format is difficult for me to follow. I would recommend getting books specific to the topics you need, as you would likely get more for your money."
1,Not impressed.,"I received this tea box as a gift from a coworker. I'm a big tea drinker and I've tried many brands and varieties of tea. The tea tasted weak and stale to me. The wrappers are a thin paper, and that might be a contributing factor to the decline in taste. I tried every flavor once and now the box just sits in my cabinet. I feel that Bigelow's tea is far superior to Bentley's and would avoid drinking Bentley's in the future."
2,The box is wood LAMINATE.,"I bought this to serve tea with a beautiful presentation for special dinners and I am pretty disappointed. The book looks nice until you get close to it and touch it. It's wood laminate NOT wood and has a light, cheap appearance. I don't know how the tea tastes, but the box definitely disappointed me."
3,Una bonita caja con te aceptable,"La caja es un bonito regalo, pero prefiero, por mucho, los sabores de Bigelow y Tazo."
5,DINGOES - Classic example of the best of Aussie Rock.,"Anyone who wants to know what GREAT MUSIC was like back in the 70""s when we were all spoiled for good AUSTRALIAN music, should listen to this album. This is what we were seeing in our pubs regularly. Who would believe it today?The Dingoes as a band werent around long, but those of us who saw them or got their album are grateful they did.DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR, GET A COPY OF THIS, DO AN DOWNLOAD OF A FEW SONGS, YOU WILL BE GUARANTEED TO BUY IT."
1,Fendi order,"I'm not sure why they stopped selling Fendi to the retail stores, however it has made it terrible to find and the vendors are not happy either.I ordered Fendi on line with Amazon and when I thought I ordered the EDT mini ( just to try it out and see if they really would send the right thing) it sent the perfume. Bummer! I went on line again and it goes to the perfume without you knowing it. Please have them bring back Fendi to the retail stores! Thank you"
5,Lucid and energetic verse,"Leviathan With A Hook is the debut collection showcasing the poetry of Kimberly Johnson. Drawing upon her scholarship in 16th and 17th century poetry, Johnson writes a lucid and energetic verse noted for a unique musical form and literary vision that will fully engage and reward her reader's attention. Pater Noster: This garden is a betrayal. It has nothing/to do with me--the brooding columbine,/anemones measuring the wind, the rose/involved, roes interrupted//not in their browse through roes of indigo./Cardinals hinge on air, draw flight/in a thread of scarlet. Fishpools gaze/at clouds, full of clouds//like fish and fish like clouds, golden/in sunlight, finning the doubled blue./The wallflower flings pale kisses at the sky./The silver maple flaps its silver at any passerby."
4,A very good phone.,"Like most people, I have purchased an unreasonable number of sub-$50 phones over the last few years, and universally, they have turned out to be crap. I finally took the financial plunge and purchased the Uniden TRU8860-2 (which is actually two handsets) and have been very, very pleased. It is extremely easy to use, is a real digital phone (DSS), has a great range, is loaded with features (that are easy to access), does not conflict with my wireless network, has a good battery life and acceptable sound. I have some slight criticisms that should not discourage you from your purchase: I don't find the sound quality to be as clear as I would hope (this has a very faint hiss), but there is no denying that it is still FAR better than all other cordless models I've purchased. Also, I find the handsets a bit small for my taste (others will disagree, to be sure), but again, a small price to pay for finally getting a cordless phone that does everything it should do - every time."
3,Good Phone,"I needed a phone without an answer machine and 5.8ghz. This one seemed to fit the bill. I read all the reviews and had mixed feelings. But since I had a $10 coupon for Amazon, I bought it. Only issue was one of the hansets just died on me. Push a button, the handset would light up, but nothing else. Amazon quickly replaced the entire system and paid for the return of the damaged set. Nothing big. Phone cannot store more than a combined 100 Caller ID numbers AND phonebook entries. Reception is good and voice quality is good. Feels a little flimsy though."
1,If you have wireless internet do NOT get this phone!,"I guess I'm one of the few people who didn't already know this, but if you use wireless internet and other wireless connections (wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, wireless printer, etc.) you CANNOT use 5.8 GHz phones without having horrible interference on the phone. In fact, even 2.4 GHz phones get ""some"" static/signal loss around wireless internet connections.Apparently, after calling Uniden customer support I found out that if you want to use a wireless phone around a wireless internet connection you MUST use a ""less advanced"" 900 MHz phone.I returned this phone and bought a 900 MHz phone that works perfect. Sad that a more advanced, more expensive phone is WORSE than a cheaper, less advanced cordless phone.If you don't have wireless internet (and none of your neighbors have wireless internet) then I'm sure this phone is fine."
3,"Ok, Agree With Other Reviewer","I was looking at adoption journals as a gift and I too preferred the Waiting for You. Waiting for You has is something you can see truly being an heirloom - nice thick pages and gender neutral. This is a perfectly fine book, but it's worth the extra money for Waiting for You. Go for it."
2,The output voltages are way off,I measured the output voltages for each settings with a digital multimeter and get the follwing readings:3V -> 4.824.5V -> 6.76V -> 8.577.5V -> 10.559V -> 12.5612V -> 16.83
2,Beats the RCA competitve product,"I had ordered just that type from another online seller/distributor. They were so shady they neglected to ship the adapter plugs with the unit, then hid behind their screen where you can only get in touch with them via email -- I'm sure we've all been there. The Coby product's plugs fit the RCA, but the RCA unit was probably more than defective anyways. This Coby unit worked -- once I had puzzled out how the plugs were meant to be oriented on the open end of the device's wiring -- with two devices with which I tried it; the RCA didn't work, same plugs and same orientation, with either. With the other guys' adapter you could barely tell if it _was working -- no indicator light, which the Coby item has. Granted I've only had it arrive here yesterday, but it already has my endorsement as something worth buying. BTW the mfr. of one of the units I tried this and the RCA on happend to BE RCA/Thomson.Steve W"
5,Good Book Simplified,"My fellow spiritual truth seekers, Amazon only sells the book but the kit you need to get from the publisher, Mr. Beckley. Interestingly enough, the kit alone is $25 + $5 shipping. The kit has all the three holy herbs needed, three white candles, Mr. Oribello's special Moses incense and lastly the Shemmah Medallion printed on gold parchment paper. The original metallic manufacturer of the Shemmah Medallion has gone out of business but you can take it yourself to a jewelry store and make it yourself with extra money. [...] The only last thing I would say about this book is that the seals printed on the pages are rather small and a bit difficult to see clearly sometimes but you can try finding better printed seals elsewhere. And as always, try not to abuse these spiritual blessings or karma will always find a way to kick you in the buttocks! Blessings."
4,Minimalism at its best.,"I was at a small local record shop a month ago, and while I was browsing, I was listening to some interesting dance music being played on the store's stereo. The beats and rhythms were tight, and the groove was really slammin', so I just HAD to ask a salesperson what was playing. Sure enough, it was this disc by Richie Hawtin. If I didn't ask the salesperson what was playing, I would have never have heard of Hawtin or this impressive mix CD. It's nearly an hour's worth of tracks that are stripped down to drum beats and a few synth touches. Most of the reviewers call it techno, but I personally think it's sometimes closer to house, as the beats per minute could easily pass for the latter genre. But regardless of what you may call it, this CD is tight! It's great for the gym, working on the computer, or even chilling around the house. And of course, if you were to play it at a party, you're guaranteed to find people on the floor dancing to it."
4,wow...,"As always I never rate anything a 5 but this book was insanely helpful! The book is extremely deep so reading several times is highly recommended. With the deepness being mentioned don't shy away from this book, even though its very deep and takes a few times to understand certain things being talked about its worth it!"
2,much of the same,"Ask yourself, how many times can you say the same thing, give it a new title, and market it well? Sure, there are always a few new spins about a subject that have never been presented in exactly the same way before. But, the concept has been shared so many times, by so many authors for well over a century, that you should ask yorself, ""what is it going to take to get the message and implement it""? Nothing new here in my opinion. Is it valuable? Sure for someone just taking their first step in the direction of conscious living! Save you money and save a few trees, the Planet could use yor help."
5,dice lighter,this is so cute i had one a while back but it blew the door fuses in my old pos achieva oldsmobilw ((dont ask me how/why)) but now i have a ford focus and it looks so cute and works fine
1,Masterpiece Classic adaption one of the worst yet,"The Masterpiece Classic adaption of A Room With a View is truly one of the worst I have ever seen. Andrew Davies did a great job adapting Pride & Prejudice, but this was a major disappointment. It seems that the current adaptions of these wonderful classics are being written for dumb audiences. We really can ""read between the lines,"" even in movies. I would prefer smarter writing and more respect for the author's work."
1,Nudity Gets Airbrushed!!!!,"If you loved seeing Simon Callow and those two other guys naked in the 1980s version, you will be deceived here. Though they recreate the same, they airbrush out the male nudity. E. M. Forster must be rolling in his grave at this! If you want to see man action, see Forster's ""Maurice"" instead. Trust me: you don't want to sit through this boring, stuff, bourgie work and not get its famous reward at the end. It's one thing to airbrus something on public TV, but why do it on a DVD that's going to be watched in one's private residence? This is ridiculous as the nudity here is technically done in a non-sexual setting and fashion."
1,Awful....just awful!,Watch the Merchant Ivory production! This adaptation lacks charm of the 1985 version and the characters in this one are insipid compared to the original.
2,These are not original pattern from Royal Doulton,These plates are nice but they are NOT the same as my other plates in this pattern. The salad plate is about an inch smaller and the red is a lighter red not a burgundy like the original. The flower is smaller and the plate is not as thick as the original. I'm keeping them but they are not really a match.
4,Jon Graham,Ice Pirates is basically space humor with a really good plot and not bad at all acting. The budget must have been a bit small but a good job was done on the end product over all. There is no doubt this is a classic that definately keeps you entertained. Probably why they play it on TV so much!
5,Just an awesome classic,Loved this movie as a kid and can appreciate it even more today. Really miss thus type of campy humor in today's movies.
4,1980s Low Budget SF at its Best,The one thing that I loved about this film is that it doesn't take it self too seriously.
4,classic comedy,"yeah, its cheesy its silly, but what it does it does well, at times raising the simple fart joke to level of high comedy."
4,"Good resource for writers, but....","This book obviously is written by someone full of passion for the techniques of Medieval Swordsmanship. However, the passion does not cover for some of the flaws. With a little more research worked into this and a correct of some of the faulty information, it would have been the bible for writers, reenactors and people interested in the historical technique of medieval sword fighting. Still when used with other historical works, it is an excellent resource.He covers medieval swords, their making, swords use with shields and against shields. He discusses sparing methods, how to stage reenactments, then historical decline of the swords, and then how the sword has evolved in martial arts of today.It's a good work, but due to glaring problems it just misses as being a great work. I would still think writers and reenactors - using it conjunction with other works - would find it a useful book and would not want to miss it."
3,"Good effort, but ...","John Clements' latest work on historical European martial arts is impressive in both scope and ambition. The graphics are excellent, clear and dynamic. Although rather haphazardly organised, the sheer volume of information offers a wealth of inspiration and practical advice, particularly for those experienced enough to ""join the dots"".BUT - unfortunately, Mr. Clements wastes reams of paper in his oft-repeated critiques of fantasy role-playing combat, SCA fighting, and so-on. Many of these attacks seem petty, and his tactic of repeating and re-stating his case ad nauseam is tiresome to say the least.Hopefully, future editions of this book will drop the flaming and baiting in favour of some good editing, and (one hopes) expanded chapters on unarmed combat, etc."
1,Another self-promotion for the gullible,"Let's make this one brief. I bought this book along with a few others because I was following a heated discussion on a sword forum between Clements and another fencing writer. After going through Medival Swordsmanship page by page, I think this is the most self-serving book ever written. The author has little to no grasp at all of the medival sources and his history looks and reads like it was clipped from a supermarket encyclopedia. I won't comment on the endless silly rants on everything not in lockstep with the writer's views. The whole purpose of the book seems to be drumming up business for himself and squeezing profits out of gullible fencers for the publisher. Buy it only if you feel you must to complete your set of worthless overpriced paperback martial arts books. If you're looking for genuine history: Pass."
3,SRT,"Mark Lonsdale, has written this book with students in mind. Some of the technology is a little out dated however. Quite interesting. Recommended."
5,Excellent music box,"My daughter, 4.5, loves this box. It was her favorite christmas present. She loves putting tiny items in all of the drawers and listening to the music."
2,It's ok,"The moves are ok, the problem is the length. I was hoping that it had different lengths when it came to workouts but the shortest one os around 30 minutes and the longest one is 2 hours."
2,Boring!!,"I tried the evening track and about fell asleep. I thought I would try the morning one, hoping for more energetic version...it was the same thing!! I'd return it if I could! HMMM, maybe I will try."
2,power yoga for everybody,"Power Yoga for Every Body (With Over 20 Workouts for All Levels of Students)It was way toooo slow!!! I expected faster flow. I mean when they call it power: I thought, when does it begin to be power?!!The instruction was very percise for beginners,(great)When I see power in a title, I want power! I couldn't even watch all the way through the programs. I watch first, so I can preview before I do the dvd. Maybe title should say ""slow power yoga.""(no power added)I will applaude the instruction part of it. Not a bad dvd, but definately not my fave, or what I expected."
2,Not very enlightening.,"I picked up this book for the history-of-marriage value instead of the same-sex-marriage-propaganda value, and found the history and debated ""reasons why people have historically married"" to be rather uninformative. A lot of what was said seemed common knowledge about basic history of society. Marriage concepts are talked about generally more often than not. I would have liked to see more hard core facts rather than musings and contemplations. I was hoping for statistics to be sprinkled liberally, and perhaps many tales of certain marriages in the past that stood out either as especially abnormal for a time period, or exceedingly typical."
2,Missed the basics,"While E. J. Graff gives a broad social history of marriage, she does not delve deeply enough into the religious history of marriage which leads to errors in her arguments. From her book, one could conclude that the Catholic Church did not consider marriage to be a sacrament until the 13th century. However, Terullian in the 2nd century wrote, ""Whence are we to find (words) enough fully to tell the happiness of that marriage which the Church cements, and the oblation confirms, and the benediction signs and seals; (which) angels carry back the news of (to heaven), (which) the Father holds for ratified."" Lacking this foundation of the essence of marriage in the Christian Church which so heavily influenced our society, she cannot argue for what marriage is for because she does not know what marriage really is."
5,Great gift,"I wasn't sure if my friend who loves Harry Potter would love this. I had other items (a Harry Potter cookbook and a Disneyland ticket) bundled with his birthday gift just to be sure he'd love it but I was surprised this one (the least expensive) is the one he truly enjoyed the most. He just didn't like the coloring pens that came along with it, though, (he complained about them ""running"" too much) so he used his own coloring materials, which he has a lot of."
4,Good Book,"I thought this was a good book, I enjoyed reading it, it must have kept me interested, otherwise I wouldn't have put a note in my Notebook, stating that this was a good book. If you like reading Westerns, then you will like reading this book."
5,Great Book! Great Writer!,"I am a huge fan of Louis L'Amour westerns. I bought this book because it stated that it was written in Louis L'Amour style. Well, I had to see for myself! I was not disappointed! The book is very well written...the descriptions throughout are detailed so well that you feel as if you are 'right there'. A great story. I am looking forward to reading the other titles from this accomplished author."
1,Hi-Low Switch Broke in Less Than One Month,"This is a pretty standard dual temp glue gun. Initially worked fine, then after about 4 weeks of use the switch to change between high and low temp broke and fell off the glue gun. Luckily it was in the low temp position which is what I mainly use, but this is still shoddy product. There has to be something sturdier out there."
4,Great Album,"Geogaddi is a great album but pales in comparison to the glorious ""Music has the Right to Children."" Maybe it's the indie kids who gave bad reviews with statements about how they didn't evolve enough, or possibly the fact that it's predecessor meant so much to me, but I think I just expected more from this album. It has some great moments like ""Julie and Candy,"" ""1969,"" and ""Alpha and Omega,"" packaged with some dark imagery with backmasking, subliminal sounds, and references to David Koresh (weird). Overall this album, though darker, is a warm album. The colors aren't as vivid as ""Music has the Right to Children,"" but they're still utterly beautiful."
1,An inescapable truth,"""As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become."" - Mormon prophet Lorenzo Snow. ""Your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God"" - first lie spoken by Satan. One can not escape the similarity in these statements. In many ways, religions throughout human history have taught that men either were or would become deities themselves, contradicting God. The Mormon view of God is perhaps the most direct expression of this concept in modern times. It is in contradiction, however, to the clear expressions of God in the Scriptures. How one man may fare in a debate, as in this work, is irrelevant to how a religion fares when compared to the clear statements of the God they claim to worship. It is the avoidance of addressing these issues that is the ultimate failing of this book."
4,Interesting quiting ideas - thinking beyond the box!,"I used this book alongside'Embroidery Machine Essentials' as a novice machine embroiderer. The table of contents is clear and various techinques explained,using clear diagrams and illustrations.What I especially enjoyed were the unusual ideas which helped the imagination envisage even more projects. The book is easy to use and a delight to read."
3,It's just water filters,"What do you want me to say; ""wow these are great filters!"" I guess they're OK. The price was right and they seem to fit."
4,Improves flavor,Don't think if you already use filtered water you don't need these. Coffee tastes much better with a good cleaning and new filters.
5,They work well,These are just the filters that you use in the Capresso Programmable Coffee Maker...they work great....easy to install and last for quite a while.
2,Filters,It was stated that customers buy the filters for coffee maker. I did just that. My only complaint is that the coffee maker I purchased doesn't use filters.
5,dont know what you mean.,"It is an excelent product but,I had to change the coffe maker for those filters,it broke down and I had to buy another one, which I can not use the filters, what can I do with them?."
4,Useful Textbook,This is a good compliment to classroom lecture. I particularly like the homework questions at the end of each chapter. They are great practice to check my understanding of the material.
1,No,"Thought this would be something similar to PostSecret, as that was what came recommended, Boy was I wrong.Not a book for those seeking to be entertained on late nights and rainy days."
5,always amazing and intriguing,"For those of you who might find the first Found book or this second one offensive in its content -- guess what? -- life is offensive. And for that matter, life is also often tragic, poignant, ironic, hysterically funny, random, and sometimes all of these things at once... the ""Found"" books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life. That's what makes it so remarkable. Indeed, how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages? This work by Davy Rothbart, co-editor Jason Bitner, and all the Found crew deserves praise because this is a cross-section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials. If, several thousand years from now, (android? zombie?) archeologists study our current century, they might go through our trash. Think of ""Found"" as giving them a headstart."
4,"Great ""boozy"" sound!","I like instrumental Christmas music, as well as vocal, and this is sure to be one of my favorites over the years! Mellow sax playing of some of the great standards for the holidays, will be great for nights in front of the fire, or as background for a holiday gathering. Definitely a bargain at this price! Enjoy!"
5,A delightful read,"The anecdotes are amazing and are typical of the 60s and 70s. She includes various recipes as well. She mentions names of various chefs and celebrities all of whom you want to find out more about. I'm only halffway through the book, but I know I won't be disappointed."
2,"Not tasteless, just boring","For years, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Gael Greene's restaurant reviews in the New York Magazine. Her ability to rhapsodize, finesse, and romance dining experiences was a weekly event I looked forward to savoring and ""tasting"" vicariously while living my MidWest-quiet life. However, although receiving very positive reviews in the New York Times, I found ""Insatiable"" to be tedious, boring - with a touch of ""too much information."" There was nothing endearing about the chronicle and I realized I was speed reading, checking page numbers hoping I'd get to the end. A Ruth Reichel this is not."
5,Be Comfy!,Fabulous sneaker! I have a hard time finding wide width shoes that fit properly and Propet makes the best of the best for comfort! Good quality and reasonably priced.
5,"Propet Women's W3902 Tour Walker Velcro Sneaker, Sport White, 9 W",Purchased for a nursing home resident who had totally worn out an exact pair. Perfect! The resident was delighted! Thank you.
3,clunky shoes,"I love Propet shoes but these were not my style. They are clunky compared to what I have ordered before, maybe I can break them in this summer."
4,Purchased For My Grandma...,"My Grandma asked me to find a great deal on Propet shoes for her. She has used Propet for many years, mainly because of the ease of the velcro straps and the good support it offers to use with her leg brace.. (she had a stroke many years ago). This is the only shoe my Grandma will purchase and the ones she has last quite some time... they withstand her unsteady transfers and moving herself about in her wheelchair constantly. Would definitely recommend this shoe to people looking for those qualities."
2,good stories but not great book,"I saw this book along with the first volume and after looking at the list of stories included in both volumes, I realized that anyone who would buy this books would be wasting their money when they can buy the Del Rey version which has all of these great mythos stories as well as an additional one- Discovery of the Ghooric Zone by Richard A Lupoff."
4,Well done,While not the world's greatest singer Shelley Fabares compensates for this with Charm Plus. I think that she is Shelley Fabulous.
3,Okay purchase.,"Shelly was never a great singer but her ""hits"" are worthy in anyone's music collection."
1,Waste of Esteban's talents playing other's songs,"I have Songs from the Heart, All My Love and Enter the Heart. The only one I think does Esteban justice is the cd of his own songs, Enter the Heart, which is very moving and a joy to listen to. The other cd's, those in which he plays the songs of others, is just elevator music and really doesn't have anything new to offer."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I heard one of Esteban's tunes on Pandora and decided to purchase the CD. He's not bad, but not on the level of Segovia or Parkening. A bit on the homogenized side."
1,Biased and not thorough,"I am a physician. I read this book after my sister had purchased it and asked for my opinion. I found the book to feel oversimplified and sort of biased - in the sense that in many cases the author implies that he knows something that your doctor does not (whereas there was not any ""news"" in here for the average North American MD). In my opinion, much of the information presented, while perhaps interesting, so far underrepresents the currently-known ""whole truth"" that it may mislead the layperson into believing that exercise and nutrition can solve all of one's ails.I am also not a fan of the ""Dummies""-like style and layout.The communication level seems appropriate for a teenager.Certainly, this is a reasonable primer but I do not recommend this book as a loner on one's home medical bookshelf since it omits so much explanation and truth (and conflicting evidence in some cases!) to further the author's dramatically simple agenda."
5,"Great story-very real, well written and engrossing","Very interesting insight into the life of a B-24 pilot. From fledgling days as a student to flying on the Ploesti raid- it gives real insight into the make-up of these very brave, very dedicated pilots. As a pilot, veteran and avid reader of WWII history , I found this to be a great read."
2,Incomplete,"I had read a hard copy of this book, borrowed from the library, several years ago. The pictorial section was not as complete as the original and I suspect other portions may have been left out also. The reason I purchased this book was to get one of the pictures I saw in the hard copy and it wasn't there."
5,the best gift,"I bought this for my 9 yrs old daughter, she loves it. It keeps her busy for hours. The product is very well made and is a good starter for keeping those little hands busy rather than on a computer mouse. I totally recommend this product"
3,Expensive But They Work,"I just received these and will post my opinion about how well they work once I've got spent some time wearing them. They were promptly sent and carefully packaged. However, as a value I see very little to recommend. Shipped, these cost me $38 and I'd guess that the expense of manufacturing the product itself was no more than the cost of the box it came it (a thin cardboard thing with a cellophane ""window"") - certainly no more than a dollar in total for the two. The plastic is a low-density expanded foam whose durability I have concerns about. I would strongly recommend prospective buyers take another look at cheaper alternatives.09/25/11 Update: My concern about the longevity (due to the foam that these are made from) has turned out to be unfounded. Three years after purchase, these are performing well and are quite durable."
1,Floppy Jalopy,"This toy was bought for my child therapy practice and I took one look at the contents and knew that it was too complicated and had so little reference to a real car that there was no way to relate to it. I am going to give it to my grandson for his birthday, and I wonder if he won't find it too complicated also. Your basic gears are much more useable and allow the child to create their own fun. I will buy one of those and let the kid create their own jalopy."
5,Vet Recommended,"This product was recommended by my vet when my dog, who is 9 years old, began slowing down. My dog showed some difficulty getting up when lying down and had trouble climbing steps. After giving this product to her for a month, she has shown considerable improvement. She seems to move more quickly and with less pain in her hips.Great recommendation by the vet and great product!"
3,Superfudge,This is a good book because it made me laugh.The funny part in the story is when the canary said bonjour stupid. Fudge was Peter's brother. Peter didn't make me laugh. The family moved to New Jersey. They have a baby girl. I think that people should read this story because it makes me laugh.
5,You Gotta Love Judy Blume!,"This is a wonderful sequel to Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing. I first read this novel in the 4th grade, and will never forget it or it's leader. Blume has a wonderful way of seeing the world through the eyes of a child, and being able to relate to her young readers.Peter doesn't see his life as easy as her thinks it should be and his brother Fudge does nothing but make it harder. Fudge has now started Kindergarten, and his educational career is marked by his calling his teacher a rat face and he has expressed that he wants to complete his life as a bird. Having to deal the the never ending antics of Fudge is hard enough, now Peter has to figure out how to handle yet another sibling. Only to throw yet another wrench into the works, he is going to have to start a new school as well and make a whole new set of friends as his family is moving for a year.I would recommend this to any elementary school level reader."
5,The Prank Wake-up,"When Fudge woke up Peter on a Saturday morning, yelling, ""You're going to be late for school!"" I think if someone Fudge's age with an older brother read this I think it might give that guy some bad ideas about waking up his older brother on a Saturday morning. So it's kind of a bad influence (not blaming Judy Blume)."
5,Hilarious Book,"This book is about a guy named Peter. Peter suddenly finds out that his mom is expecting a new baby and she's going to name it Toostie. As if Fudge wasn't enough already! Fudge is four years odl and he's a handful. And to top it all off they're moving to Priceton for a year. peter has to leave behind all of his friends. He makes new firends. But does he stay or does he go back to where he came from? Read this book to find out, trust me you'd be suprised how funny it is!Review by:Frances"
4,Superfudge,I teach school and the students love Judy Bloom books. We read Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing first and the kids couldn't wait to read Superfudge.
2,Very Artifical Tasting,"Yeah it's made with artifical sweetner, so I don't expect it to taste like real barbeque sauce, but this isn't very good. It's especially terrible as a dipping sauce. It's not completely terrible if you use it to cook with though."
1,"Disgusting, One of the Worst Things I have ever Tasted.",How is this even sold! I have tasted some pretty nasty things in my life and this by far is the worst. I bought this yesterday because my wife can not have gluten. I wish I had my five dollars back. I should have known to put it back on the shelf when I read one of the ingredients was Red Cabbage.
2,"Good on calories, bad on taste",Not recommended for those with taste buds.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it's 0 calorie - so it has every right to taste awful.Would never buy again. Please god don't ever let me buy again.
4,Love this stuff!,"I haven't purchased this item here, I get it at my local grocery, however, I love the stuff. I do not use it as BBQ sauce though. I agree with some of the comments stating that it is a bit thin, and not really BBQ flavored. However, I do use this more as a condiment, instead of catchup or 57 sauce - for THAT purpose, with zero cal,carbs, etc...it is an awesome product! :D I also really enjoy the flavor. But taste is completely individual. It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)"
2,Meh....,"I absolutely LOVE Walden Farms' salad dressings. However, this product was not appetizing to me after the tasting it and it has a very unpleasant, lingering aftertaste. I tried to doctor it up a bit so that the aftertaste wasn't so undesirable. Nothing really worked. Additionally, the smell is unappealing."
2,"Sugar Free Part is Okay, But the Recipe Isn't","I buy sugar free products a lot, and it is hard to find sugar free barbecue sauce. I held out hope for this, and indeed did use the whole bottle. I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please. I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce. In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either. Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself. I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too. However, if you have a choice, choose the other brand(s) first before bothering with this."
4,Looking for a good indie flick?,"Admittedly, this movie is not for everyone. It moves at a sometimes frustratingly slow pace, but the actors' subtleties truly make up for it. This is a movie that you really have to sit down and pay attention to...and you will always catch a facial expression or pause that will explain more than the dialogue between the characters. You will be surprised at the lack of dialogue in many of the scenes, but the silent interaction between all three main characters is unmistakably expressive in itself. I would definitely recommend this movie to those who appreciate indie and asian-american films...but I don't think those who solely enjoy shoot-em-ups and action films will appreciate the subtle layers of the acting and story."
4,Great movie,What can I say. It's a movie. A pretty damn good classic of a movie. Charlie and Emelio on the same screen doesn't happen often. Definitely a must see for those who grew up in the 80's.
3,Average Level of Interest,My 4 and half year old daughter liked it for a few days and she is no longer interested in it any more.
3,"Fine for what it is, but pretty cheap","To be honest, I didn't expect much given the cost, but was still disappointed to find out the box is made of cardboard (albeit very sturdy cardboard). Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Still, it's meant for a child which means it's not going to last forever regardless of what it's made of."
4,Fly Fisherman must have on Knots,"This book is a very good book for Fly Fishermen of all backgrounds. It has great illustrations that are easy to follow for knot tiers of any level. I keep mine in my pack so if I need to reference it in the field or just sitting around the house tying my own leaders. The book is small enough it does not take up any space in your pack, or easily fit in to your pocket. It is a great resource."
5,Best book available on Savate and its affiliated arts,"This book covers the basics of the street fighting style of Savate, called Danse de Rue Savate. It is a system that incorporates the techniques of savate, boxe-francaise, lutte parisseine, chausson, zipota and la canne et baton d'armes. If you want to see what savate really is, when it isn't reduced to a sport, this book is for you. The kicking, striking, weapon techniques and grappling are discussed as part of an intergrated whole. Clear explanations and lots of photos illustrate the techniques. A long history section traces the development of savate out of the wide variety of western martial arts, most of which are no lnger practiced."
5,Lessons in character-building,"A synopsis of ""Sense & Sensibility"" by one of your reviewers influenced me into purchasing this particular version even though I already owned the one with Kate Winslett. Their review was RIGHT ON! The scenery is breath-taking, and the acting is superb. Such a wonderful love story that one doesn't want it to end. This offers many hours of low-cost entertainment that also influences me to be a better person."
4,Best Sense and Sensibility movie to date,"I have watched all of Jane Austen's movies, read the books and find this the best of the Sense and Sensibility movies that I have seen. I loved Alan Rickman in another of the movies, but David Morrisey is great in this one. As an added bonus I received Miss Austen Regrets which is rather interesting in itself. I would highly recommend this version of Sense and Sensibility to anyone who loves Austen."
4,Good but movie better,"I love Jane Austin. The movie of Pride and Prejudice was no where near as good as the miniseries on Cable. This production of Sense and Sensibility done on BBC and rebroadcast by Government Television in the US is just the opposite. The movie which won many awards is by far the superior. This is a good production but if one has to spend money getting one copy, buy the movie."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS EMMA THOMPSON'S VERSION,I had the opportunity to see this version and felt that it was drawn out too much and didnt keep my attention. The acting didnt impress me much either (and I am sorry to say that...I dont care to make negative comments.)I appreciate Emma Thompsons version of Sense and Sensibility. I was able to relate to the characters better and I thought the acting was outstanding. It was performed in such a way as to make me wish these people were my friends...and in some small way they are...which is how I think all movies should move us. And unfortunately this version didnt do that.
2,missing the second half of movie,"After watching the first disc we load the second and find it does not contain the last half of the movie, only the miss Austen regrets movie. tried the home menu and even allowed it to play straight through but could not find the end of the movie. fortunately we have the whole movie on another dvd and know how it ends."
5,Sense & Sensibility,We are very pleased with the Video. We are not pleased that Amazon promised delivery in 3 days if we ordered immediately but didn't get the video when promised.
4,WORTH IT,"Even though this adaptation of PERSUASION is not as ""complete"" as others, I still enjoy owning it, as I do this beautifully-filmed new version of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Martin Phipps does it again with his breathtaking soundtrack on both films! MISS AUSTEN REGRETS is just the sprinkles on this Jane Austen sundae - not absolutely necessary, but a pleasant addition. The price of this collection is worth it."
2,Manufacturer appears out of business,"The features and price are all good as a home-use postage scale.Unfortunately, the manufacturer appears out of business and I cannot get a new rate chart chip for the 2006 postage rate change. The manual update method described in the user's manual does not work for me."
1,Poor battery,The battery I purchased does not allow me to hear as well as the one I purchased two years ago and I have to recharge everyday and get a short lifespan when using the cell phone.
1,Crap!,"I saw this CD at a friends house and noticed that it was mixed by Ferry Corsten, so I immediately asked if I could borrow it. It turned out that he had several other Trance Nation CDs mixed by Ferry Corsten. I borrowed them all from him and gave them a listen when I got home. To my surprise, all the CDs sucked enourmously!!! I can't believe Ferry Corsten agreed to mix all this poppy garbage!!! If you want to see what Ferry Corsten is capable of achieving, then get Global Trancemissions 01 & 02, and Right of Way instead than this piece of crap."
1,No Thanks,"I jumped up and down excitedly in the driveway finding the T.D. Jakes teaching in the mail. I could hardly wait to put it on and receive almost an hour of actual teaching. I have never paid money for a teaching, but when watching a half-hour program on one of the Bible networks, ( which is on twice a week at 1:30 am) it left me a desire to see the entire sermon. I summon up the courage and faith to purchase one of the sermons always being advertised - and what do I get?5 minutes of preaching?!!!!!No thanks."
3,"Ties up the loose ends, but are the threads too tight?","Although one of the betterall-original stories that Mckinney added to the Robotech novels, the plausibility of it, even in a series of pure fiction, is too beyond belief. Mckinney seems to try too hard to fill in the loose ends and winds up with a series of events that have nothing to do with the ending, which is all wrapped up in a few short pages of Lisa's diary. The only loose ends are the SDF-4 and Rem, and Minmei. Even being a ""Mckinneyist"" I feel that this is one of the books read because you're a fan looking for closure, but it should not have been written."
1,ADD,"I had a really hard time staying focused on the movie. I wanted to like it, I'm not hard to entertain but I kept finding my mind drifting off to everything under the sun. I'm sure, maybe, if I can get myself to sit down and try to watch it again, I'll find something to like about it. I doubt I'll actually be able to work up the desire to give it that second chance though."
4,Great Show!,"My dd got this for Christmas and now owns all four volume sets. Others have listed the episodes that are included in this set, so I will not. I will say that these are some of my personal favorite episodes. Many of these episodes are available in a compilation DVD, but I definitely recommend buying the season sets. This is a great show for the entire family. It is fun for the kids and usually not too dumbed down for the grownups. The kids have even converted my 30 something sister w/o kids as a fan. She now DVR's the episodes!"
5,Superb,"This was the first of Arthur Upfield's books that I read, and then went on to his other books, fortunately a large number, all of them wonderful--plot, characters, but most of all the beautiful evocations of the Aborigines, their philosophy and way of living, and the landscapes. When I read the also terrific books by Tony Hillerman, I wondered if he had been influenced by Upfield, and in an interview he spoke about his admiration of Upfield."
1,Not worth the money,"I was sadly disappointed when this arrived. I bought this because we're new to Arizona and wanted a book to help identity the trees, shrubs, cacti in our yard and neighborhood. It's almost impossible to do with this book. It identifies everything through its flower so if you're out of the plants' blooming season, you cannot identify it. Even when a plant is blooming, it's very difficult as there are only small pictures of the branches, not of the trees or bushes themselves. I'm going to donate it and buy a new one."
3,"Well organized, good for most of arizona","Arrived as expected, the pictures are all in color so identifying plants is made easier. Did not completely fulfill my needs, it seems to mostly discuss the plantlife throughout most of arizona, but I'm up here at 7000 feet above sea level and this book does not discuss everything that is found in the northern arizona regions."
3,board game,haven't really used it. left for winter home right after it was delivered soo it is still in maine will probably get to it when we return in may
5,Sequence Deluxe is a MUST for young & old,"This is the second Deluxe Sequence we have purchased from Amazon. Our first was 2 years ago. This one was ordered for friends we introduced to the game.The deluxe version has a vinyl roll up board that is more durable than the cardboard regular version. The markers are 2 sided so you can flip them when you get a sequence. The cards don't hold up too well, but you can easily replace them. It takes 2 decks.Great for all ages!! Easy to learn-not a card game-this is a board game. We're retired but we've taught and played with tweens (10-12 yrs.)and they love it too."
4,Good general information on the sector,This book offers a good analysis of the sector. My only issue with the book was that the data was a bit dated. I mistakenly thought the information was from 2006 but realized the analysis referenced facts from the mid to late 90s. But for a general reference on the space I thought it provided good background info.
5,Required reading for entrepreneurs and those who give them advice.,"This book continues to be the best ever written for those of us who want to learn the truth about how new businesses really start and grow, who try to be helpful to startups and small business owners.To help spread the word, some of us have formed the new, free Small Business Chamber of Commerce to cooperate with local chambers across Colorado and eventually beyond to offer an alternative to the unhelpful SBA venture capital approach to startup. For more see our website SmallBizChamber(dot)org or our Facebook Page Facebook.com/Small.Business.Chamber"
3,UPLIFTING AND MOVING GOSPEL,THIS WAS ONE OF MY LIKEABLE PURCHASES UNBEKNOWNST TO ME IT WOULD COME WITH A DVD. PUT IT IN THE CD PLAYER AND THOUGHT I HAD PURCHASED A DUD UNTIL I READ THE BONUS DVD IMPRINTED ON IT. I LIKE THIS PRODUCT
2,"Nice light, but does not dim","The light output luminosity and color temperature is great. It is much better than my original 65W incandescent.The lamp is dimmable, but I could only get it to about 70% on both my 600W Lutron linear slider and 1000W Lutron rotary dimmer, which is unacceptable. I did not notice any buzzing or flickering when dimming, though at its lowest setting, the CFL tube on the inside had a plasma ball look with the gasses swirling around and a slight purplish tint.The real deal killer was that it is 1/2"" longer than the existing bulb and even with my Halo recessed can on the largest bulb setting, it stuck out beyond the baffle trim and looked awful."
3,Toastmaster 7093S Convection Oven,The glass door exploded into a thousand glass pieces. The company sent me a new door. They have changed the way the door is held shut from the old models. I don't think the door shuts as tight as the old models but the latch on the old models was the pits. They have added a light for the inside and a timer which is a nice touch.I had my old one for about 9 or 10 years so if I get this kind of service from this one I will have no complaints.
3,Newer but not better!,"I bought this unit to replace a unit that was at least 10 yrs. old. The first thing I noticed, the new one is about 5 lbs. lighter than the one I replaced. This makes it unstable and it slips and slides on my counter. Couple this with the fact that when the oven gets hot the rack and broiler pan no longer slide in or out properly on their tracks.The oven is unnecessarily NOISY. There is a loud tick-tick coming from the fan blade hitting something and it does'nt stop until you turn the oven off.The general fit and finish of the unit I received is definately SUB-PAR the top was scratched and there were several places where the sheet metal is rippled or bent.In my opinion,If I had any children or young teenagers in the house I WOULD NOT BUY this appliance as it could be dangerous and cause injury.While I am comparing this to an older unit the new unit generally falls short all around except in the price department."
5,A fabulous cook book,"Extremely easy, fast, and excellent tasting recipes. The sauces and marinades alone are well worth the cost of the book. Some recipes are quite mundane, while others offer new and unexpected (but yummy) combinations of things."
3,Snow Miser is cool,This product arrived with some sort of glue on the base which I had to clean off. This was obviously a packaging issue at the factory as the package was sealed and in perfect condition. Not a big dea.
5,great photo-storytelling,"The photographs of the dancers, the art, the story, and depth of the journey are captured beautifully and effectively, in pages after pages of breathtaking shots..."
2,must have book for dance and art lovers,this is a delightful book to own for anyone who loves and respect the art of dance. what better book to have than an american icon dance company like alvin aliey.great addition to ones book collection.
4,Very enjoyable.,"I like the character of Cadfael, who has come to the order later in life with a full history of experience behind him. There are interesting secondary characters and subplots that don't overshadow the primary mystery, and a clever the twist at the end. The book is well written, unpretentious and very enjoyable."
4,Morbid Taste for Bones,"This book starts off slowly, but fans of Hercule Poirot should really like it. Brother Cadfael is an unusual detective, and this story is a real change from modern detective stories that are full of foul language and crudity."
2,Not too impressed,I borrowed this from our school library and made about 5 or 6 recipes. They sure sounded good in the descriptions but the final results were less than wonderful. They were edible I guess. But I guess that's the function of a slow cooker - to make something to eat while you're busy vs. make something wonderful while hovering over the stove / oven / grill.
2,Disappointed,The recipes in this book were just ok. I wanted a book on slow cooking and there are several chapters on cooking without the slow cooker. I have better recipes for things like that. I guess I will continue my search for a good slow cooker cookbook.
3,Biggest but not best,"Recipes are numerous, but they tend to be bland for those who enjoy the variant tastes of herbs and spices. The recipes are fairly easy although cooking times are far less than even an ""about"" science let alone an ""exact"" science. If you enjoy adding your own ingredients to acceptable recipes, this may be your book."
1,Many recipes don't involve the use of slow cooker! Stupid!,"When I found the first recipe that didn't involve the use of slow cooker, I thought ""Opps, must have not gotten modified as planned."" But then I found more. Lots more. Is it too much to expect that the recipes in a book titled Slow Cooker Recipes actually involve the use of a slow cooker? Lazy authors, sloven editing. Insulting to the customer.Save your money. Consider buying Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook instead."
2,"For me, a lot of wasted pages","Of the 400+ pages only 190 of them are of any use to me. I use a crockpot because it is simple and tasty cooking. So, I was expecting alot of main dish recipies. And I was also expecting them all to be for the crockpot. There is over 60 pages of recipes that do not use the crockpot. There is over 125 pages dedicated to beverages, soups, breads, and desserts. I have never met anyone who has made hot chocolate or apple bread in a crockpot. Of the 190 pages of worth. only 25 pages were the type of recipies that I was looking for. ie. the chop-it up and throw it in the pot type. everything else involved browning or braising or some other type of stove technique. I guess I'm just the kind of cook who doesn't want to screw around with browning anything. I bought this specifically because of the reviews on amazon. Hopefully this review will speak to those of you like me that are not chefs and are just looking for something easy and tasty to cook."
2,Biggest Book of Disappointing Slow Cooker Recipes!,"I am like the last reviewer - I wanted easy, chop it/dump it in and forget about it type of recipes. At first glance in the bookstore it looked good and bought it. I have been disappointed by this one - a lot of recipes have ""weird"" ingredients that a family with small kids just wouldn't eat or that I wouldn't have in my cupboards. I keep looking for a ""keeper"" recipe and just can't find it. Look at other slow cooker cookbooks - pass on this one."
4,Period mystery mit schlag,"""A Death in Vienna"" is as much a tour around the Ringstrasse of Vienna circa 1900 as it is a mystery. The story---told by author Frank Tallis in short episodes--has its characters and plot revolve around the city's landmarks like the Prater, Graben and Cafe Central while discussing the social and cultural events of the moment. The book's protagonist is a young pyschiatrist/psychoalnalyst, Max Liebermann, who is called upon by a police inspector friend to help solve the ""locked room"" murder of a beautiful clairvoyant, which seems to involve the occult.The plot is intricate with not a few red herrings strewn in the protagonist's (and the reader's) path.This a particularly enjoyable book for anyone with an interest in the cultural life Vienna of the early 20th Century, psychiatry, the cultural/social dynamic between Austrian Jews and Gentiles, the Secessionist Movement, pastries, or just a well-told mystery."
2,Too slow paced,"The book could be exciting if they cut it down by 100 pages since not a lot of action or introspection is reflected in the size of the book. I had to skip the middle and go to the end, and I am used to reading even longer texts."
2,way too simple,"The characters are ok, but the plot is horribly predictable. The promised ""twist ending"" is anything but. Your first guess on the how-dunnit is likely to be right; 400 pages later, it is merely confirmed. A disappointment."
5,A Quality Effort,"I've been into Built to Spill for about 5 years and was lucky enough to catch them live in September of '05- Three guitars-What an aural onslaught! Any way..Ancient Melodies of the Future contains some BTS's BEST songs and they happen to be of the mellow persuasion -""Alarmed""-""words for fighting ,words for fun-they've all melted onto one"" freakin great song.""Strange"" has a ""stony summer's day"" feel to it same as "" You Are"" and I cannot believe how many reviews I went through here and most of them did not mention one of the greatest songs by ANY band in the last 10 years ,""The Weather"".It sounds as fresh and touching the 100th time hearing it as the first .This is a must have CD. It's just as good if not better than previous BTS efforts...Really."
2,after awhile it hurts to smile...,"After a great run AMOTF comes as a big disappointment. Since I bought this when it was released it hardly ever hits my CD player. It lacks the complicated lush style of Perfect From Now On, the simple sharp pop melodies of Secret, the honest simplicity of Love and the aggresive sharp edge of Wavers or the Normal Years.That's not to say it's without merit, but when the only track I can remember the name of (and the only song I play frequently and the only melody I remember) is the excellent uptempo ""Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss"" you know you're in trouble.I would comment on the music, lyrics, vocals and guitar acrobatics of Doug Martsch but to be honest I can't really remember them. Which sadly, is the disappointing truth and which sums up the album. it's just too easily forgettable."
4,Great!,"I really like this new album. It is louder than their last few LP's and more distorted, but I think this is good. BTS has always been a hard rock outfit at heart, and here they really cut loose. Old fans will love it, and new fans will too."
3,Why is this book so controvertial?,"Why is everybody so mean when they review this book? It seems like every one is hateing each other. If the book is [poor], then just leave it at that, but don't personally attack people who disagree with the book. and yes, I have read its pages, and i am not sure what to think since my high school teacher always said not to use just once source when wirting a paper."
2,Well studied misinformation.,"Fawn Brodie's book is fairly well studied out, however, it does not tell both sides of the story, and does not represent historical facts correctly. For an evenly balanced look at her views, read: Sounding Brass and Tinkling Symbols by Hugh Nibley. He answers most of her objections quite handily."
2,Don't Expect Good-Looking Women,"It's a new school year, and that means fraternity initiations. The film is almost what you expect - not too dull, not very imaginative. However, two important caveats: almost no funny jokes - all the humor is gross-out humor; almost no female skin - in fact, most of the nudity is male, with the exception of one actress who goes briefly topless twice. Not worth the time or the cost."
2,Looks good; bad quality,"We bought several sets of this flatware in different colors to mix and match with our vintage and modern Fiestaware dishes. The table settings are fun and colorful, but the quality of this China-made flatware is very poor. Our sets are about one year old, used several times a week. Many spoons have bent and several spoons and forks have broken apart. I notice in other reviews that there is a guarantee, which I didn't realize when I tossed our broken pieces in the trash. If you buy this flatware for the fun of it, keep your receipt and be prepared to make a claim on the guarantee."
2,Overrated!,"I got this scale because I read that it would store previous measurements to track your weight history. After reading the manual, it apparently does not do that.Additionally, according to the manual the scale's body fat measurement does not work properly if you are considered ""athletic"" or ""fit"", which makes that feature useless for me."
2,cute but not gorgeous,cute but not gorgeous. as in they have a hint of blue but not as blue as i expected. They are more like brilliant white especially compared to some other ones i have seen that look so blue that it illuminated blue from every angle. They need to put the pic on the box or online to where u are driving up on them to show what they really look like.
3,"For the money, it's not bad.","It's not a bad guitar for the money. The tone isn't as full and rich as my Yamaha. Would I buy it again? - maybe. I wish I would have had the opportunity (time/access) to play a few demos at a music store but the price offered by Amazon was worth the risk. Invest another $100 and have the guitar set up by a professional. Also, change the nut and bridge. This can be done very inexpensively during the setup. Do yourself a favor and change the strings to something lighter. I've been playing guitar for years and the 'cables' installed from the manufacturer hurt MY fingers. It would discourage a new player altogether. Keeping the guitar tuned has also been a challenge. Many factors affect tuning (temp, humidity, playing time) but this guitar requires more frequent tuning than my Yamaha 12 string. BOTTOM LINE - if you are thinking about a 12 string, this guitar is a safe purchase and you will need to invest a few more dollars to get it setup for YOU. Buy a case to protect it."
1,Jesus the Healer,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer about 2 months ago, so my Pastor's wife gave me this book. I read this book, the more I read the angrier I got, how any one dare put this illness as my fault. I am a very strong Christian and total believe, that if it be God's will, you will be healed. I have prayed for a miracle healing, but God chose to heal me through the doctors and not through denial of this illness. I refuse to believe it is my fault that God did not make this illness just disappear, like it was never there. I feel God allows things to happen to strength your faith, not to accuse you of lack of faith. I have grown even closer to him because of this illness and if you received this book because you have an illness just keep praying to God to keep you strong. God knows we have weakness but he still loves you and is there for you. Just keep your eyes on him and do not feel guilty for an illness that is satan's fault not yours."
5,Bob the Builder: Bob's Big Plan,"This is a great video, my grandchildren really like it. It came in time for Christmas, so the service was great."
5,It's about damn time!,"The essential road trip loaded with Shiner beer, bottle rockets, ""rattlers"", Dom, sky diving and ""Where's your car?.... You're drinking it!"""
4,Fantastic ballpoint experience as long as the ink flows...,"The Cross Ion ballpoint pen is a clever sexy pen that is normally a joy to write with - the ink is deep black, the line strong and oddly malleable, with a smooth flow over paper in any direction. Unfortunately, the ink cartridges suffer from a major flaw - they occasionally stop writing, with lots of ink still in them. So, within one pack of five, one cartidge might write until it is empty and another dry up after two days with no difference in use. That is why one should always buy a five cartridge pack."
5,Yummy,"Cookies are really good!! If they weren't portioned in 100 calorie packs, I would eat way too many."
5,Great product and value,This cutter cutes straight and precise. It is irreplaceble for card making and scrapbookers!
5,Excellent product,"I purchased this product to primarily cut cardstock and photos. I had shopped in Office Max, Staples and Michael's for paper cutters and did not like the brands or styles available or the prices. This product is precise (as long as I put the paper in straight!), and stays precise when cutting, which was why I chose a rotary cutter over a lever. Price is excellent for the quality and the size is perfect for storage."
3,Rotary sheet tirmmer,Reasonably well-made trimmer. Nice clean cuts. Just have to remember to apply moderate pressure to cutting wheel when using.
4,Cute...,I liked this book a lot.. I read it in an hour.. couldnt put it down. It was a humorous look at a not always fun situation... very straight forward. It was encouraging.
2,everything we know,Book was ok - it told you all that we know about ex-wives but didnt come up with any solutions on how to deal with her. It just told it how it is.
1,Pass over this one.,"I have seen Todd solo and with Utopia so many times, I cannot count it. Enjoyed each show, thought this would be a nice addition to the collection. I was wrong. It is the worst release of any artist I have ever seen. An actual piece of crap. Todd's pseudo-intellectual attitude seems to have gotten the best of him, thinking his fans would buy anything he puts out. He was right. I bought it, watched it, took it back and demanded my money. He should be embarrassed by this one. A real stinker."
1,Full of Mistakes and a Waste of TIME,"As a historian who deals with life in the 18th century on a day to day basis I was appauled at the utter nonsense in this book. All right, I understand it was written over a hundred years ago but why anyone continues to reprint this book which has mistakes on each and every page is beyond me. And what is worse is that for the NON-HISTORIAN it is taken as truth. I know this for a fact, as I get teachers who come into my place of work saying things are are wrong and when I aske where they picked this information up it is usually this book. Please, with so much great and MODERN research out there don't waste your time and your money on this. You may have to read books on individual subjects but at least you'll know better."
4,Motivational,"When I received the booklet I immediately was excited. It has a lot of motivational information along each day. It also has an introduction that is very informative. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it only comes with 3 months worth of ""I Did It"" stickers. This booklet is for 6 months of usage. If it only has 3 months worth of stickers it feels like it's only going to be halfway successful. Every little bit helps when it comes to personal motivation. I would still recommend this to my friends."
3,Worked well until it got dropped....,"A nice item, the back wall is a great feature for a variety of reasons....big & bulky to store...could have been more durable for as heavy as it is....Not fully functional after being dropped once..."
1,THIS SET SUCKS! GET ALL 74 EPISODES FOR SAME PRICE AT JAPANIMESOURCE!!!!,"i'm sorry. this is my favorite anime of all time. i bought this set first thinking that they were going to release the entire anime in english. I WAS WRONG!!! the english voice acting is good and the picture quality has been enhanced greatly, but, looking back now, how could i recommend this release after having purchased all 74 episodes for $42 in japanese with english subtitles when the english version will never see another episode hit the light of day? you will waste your money buying this set as it is cut off at episode 15 and will never continue after that. goto japanimesource.com and get the entire 74 episode series for $42."
1,Unwatchable,"A horrible, terrible movie. No pacing, no wit (Elephant Man as a musical is leagues away from Springtime for Hitler folks) and a gutless waste of many talents. If you're considering purchasing this movie, I beg of you, rent it first. If you can make it through the first ten minutes without wanting to hurl yourself out the window, good on ya. Otherwise, count your blessings that you won't embarrass yourself by having it on the shelf when company comes by. Oy what a terrible movie."
4,"Great, but I wish there was more ink","Ink runs out relatively quickly, but I suppose that's what I should expect for such a small pen. It can get expensive to constantly refill."
1,Doesn't work!,I ordered this cartridge and received it two days later. I installed it and it wrote one word and would not write anything more then that. Very disappointed with the product. I now have to bother myself to package it back up and return it to a UPS store. This is a lot of work for nothing.
5,Couldn't put it down,"This is one of the few times when I, as the author of nine published novels, can say I wish I had written this one. So when I say I ""could not put it down,"" I say this literally. The author denied me sleep, one night until nearly dawn, the next night until I reached the last page -- which I reached with regret because I wanted more. I found it at once a story of humanity and man's insatiable desire to better himself. The story of the pioneering helicopter flights were especially gripping, but equally gratifying is the story of the protagonist himself, the unforgettable, irrepressible Captain Red. Read it, you will not be sorry!"
4,"""Emeralds, filled with information""","I read Fred Ward's book ""Emeralds"", a part of his gem series, for an oral report I had to do for school. This book is packed with information on emeralds, from general info, to the cutting process; this book has it all! Not only is Fred Ward a talented author and researcher, but also he takes magnificent photographs. This book has lots of beautiful pictures of emeralds from all over the world. Fred Ward gives you a history of emeralds and their importance with the ancients. And shows and tells you about some of the beautiful jewelry that emeralds are in today, as well in the past. It even has a buying guide that shows what to look for when buying emeralds. I did tons of research for my report, and used a lot of books, but none of them even came close to ""Emeralds""."
2,too clutered,"I've used Langan's books from Townsend press, so I expected something a little more straightforward and clear.This is a little difficult to get through to find the sections I might be able to use."
4,Here's what was in my variety pack,"This is what was included in my order of this variety pack:Frosted Flakes (most predominately)Froot LoopsApple JacksFrosted Mini WheatsChocolate Frosted Mini Wheats.I haven't counted how many of each but in my box there were no Mini Swirlz bowls, the Chocolate Frosted Mini Wheats were included instead. That's fine with me but I was hoping for the Mini Swirlz."
2,workout shirt,"I didn't like the cut of this shirt, it's too boxy. I looks like I'm wearing a plastic bag or something. I know it's for working out or playing basketball, but I just hate the way it made me look. It's not as light as I hoped either. I prefer light weight clothing when I work out. I'm trying to lose weight and this shirt gave me a complex. I only wore it once! And now that the summer's over, I doubt I'll wear it again."
1,Broken Knob - Take 2,"Ironically, I read a previous review (Reviewer: A guest from Melbourne, FL) that mentioned a missing/broken knob. We went ahead and purchased this model today and, lo and behold, I take it out of the box to find one of the knobs broken. Taking it back and heading to Sears....."
1,broke on one side after a year,This was a darn cute toaster and we were very pleased with how it toasted. One side of the toaster quite working after a year and a half though. This is annoying to have basically a 2 slice toaster (after one side broke) that takes up half my counter space! Don't bother buying this one.
3,It's OK,"The led light is almost worthless, but the laser pointer seems to work well out of the box. There are no instructions and it was a little strange getting the batteries put in place. I don't really need the pen or stylus, but for the price I figured, why not? We'll see how well it holds up over time and travel."
5,Each Little Bird That Sings,"[...]Each Little Bird That Sings is a really meaningful book. It has a lot of emotion in it, and I cried a lot by the end. Comfort had a huge transformation, and has a very believable personality. It was very enjoyable to read and I could not put down the book. The writing was very rich and had a lot of descriptive paragraphs. Over all, the book was really good, but it is not the sort of book I would read again. Part of the excitement and enjoyment is the various surprises and the suspenseful plot."
1,Pretentious Pot Luck,"Save your money and buy a Gourmet Magazine. Carly Simon, Diane Sawyer, Mary Steenburgen....big names, little talent in the cooking department. This cookbook should be entitled ""this is how we Beautiful People eat. We just can't cook."" For Heaven sake, the author even admitted she likes to entertain, but doesn't care too much for cooking, which is why she has potluck at every turn. Nice picture of pretty people having a good time. Lousy recipes. Buy it ONLY if you are interested in the lifestyles of the rich and famous, Martha's Vineyard style!"
2,"Glossy, fun, but......","Sure it's fun looking. Great pictures. But some of the recipes I tried were far from good and I AM a cook. In addition, once you look through it, you get a little tired of seeing all of these gorgeous faces in glamourous settings and long for something a bit more ""real"". I am not sure why I bought this- and I will get a little fun out of it, but I will be passing it on as it is not a keeper. Makes a decent GIFT, but for the serious cook- or even the not so serious cook- this will be like an afternoon with People Magazine. Not a lot worth remembering."
1,Disappointed...,"In looking for a new dictionary, I was extremely interested in having a non audio updated version for my computer and could be used with other programs, ie: MS Word. The program is easy to install and use, however, I found it to be at least 2 years out of date, if not more, and with old GDI's. It fits the basic needs of an electronic dictionary, but am surprided that Merriam-Webster is still promoting and selling this product."
1,Shortcomings,"This product really needs the addition of an audio pronouncing feature, in our opinion. Without this feature, correct pronouncing is quite difficult."
5,Can't imagine NOT having it!,"LOVE this griddle. I have 4 boys and cooking pancakes and grilled cheese (staples around here) was always a long tedious process, not anymore! I can easily cook 6-8 grilled cheese sandwiches at ONE TIME :)"
5,"Sequence - good, fun group board/card game",This is a great game for parties or small groups. You can play with anywhere from 2 to 12 players and the rules can be learned in just a few minutes.
5,Great fun to play with other couples!!!,We have so much fun playing with one or two other couples. You definitely need more than two people to make it more fun.Also fun to play with the grandchildren as they catch on pretty fast!Have Fun!
5,Great strategy game!,We chose this Sequence game because our neighbors introduced us to it. Once we learned the game it was exciting to use strategic plays to stop our opponent. We can play singly or with a partner.I recommend this game to anyone!
5,Sequence Game,"The product is high quality, good for kids and adults and arrived on the day it was promised. Very pleased."
5,Sequence,"Ordered this through Amazon.after playing at a family gathering. We have ages 8 to 81 playing and everyone had a great time. Since buying it, my husband and I have played on several evenings. For the past 2 weeks ends friends have come over to play. Everyone has loved this game. Some luck, some plotting. Great fun for all ages."
4,Was hesitant at first but really enjoyed this game,"Friends of ours have this game and brought it out on an evening after dinner. I was very hesitant at first. I don't normally like board games with cards or chips. I typically prefer more outspoken, interactive games. Surprisingly, I rather enjoyed this game. I love playing defense and keeping my opponent from making five in a row. This game is smart and fun at the same time. I would recommend that anyone try this. It can be addicting."
4,Great Game,Love this game. played it loads. very easy to learn. lots of fun. We often get this out when friends come over for a meal. it just helps conversation etc.
1,Burnt Offerings,DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER-OVEN!I bought the oven 6 months ago because of it's easy-clean feature but the oven is a piece of junk. It burns just about everything.Toast is either burned or not toasted. Any 2nd toast will always be burned. Don't try to even warm pizza - it burns.Inner liner was poorly mfr and the rack sits crooked. Handle keeps coming off of the door.This thing is going in the trash - I wouldn't even think of giving it away.
2,Poor quality,Some of the refills were defective(big air bubbles in barrel) or dried out already. Only had 2 that worked. Disappointed.
3,sluggish,"The remote is well designed, and small. fits in the plam of your hand. But it seems very slow in responding to power/on power off, and really isn't all that good from about 10 feet away, where I control my Roady from while at my desk. It does use a nice 3V coin battery that comes with it, but for channel surfing, not a good design."
2,Boring and rather annoying,I'm not sure why I picked up the book in the first place and I wasn't surprised that I didn't enjoy it. It was rather bland and the topic just annoying. I was hoping it would spend more time making fun of Washingtong fashion and less time talking about reality makeovers. The fasion bites were the best part of the book - funny and to the point. The rest of the book was just plain bland (a little like the way Washington dresses...). Skip this series and find another one is my recommendation.
4,Good but technical,"There are some long reviews on the book by professionals that I can't match in content. However for readers interested in this book because of previous reading of 'irrational exuberance' or even 'the new financial order', be warned! It is a pretty technical book with lot's of statistics. Without basic knowledge of all the R's and covariances a lot of the true value gets lost. Still Robert Shiller is a clear thinker and even without a good grasp of teh statistics it still contains interesting observations."
1,Too complicated,"This book is not for every investor, since the contents are very theoritical and complicated. Unfortunately, even the book full of statistic/mathematic equation, the conclusion is little."
4,One of a kind situations,"A transfer from VHS to DVD, the quality of it is not up to the standard of the latest and greatest. On the other hand, you get a landing at an 11,000 foot altitude airport where the flight crew has to go on oxygen and alter cabin pressure to compensate. The flying sequences are good, the scenery is good ( operations in Columbia and Miami) and the crew is professional and skilled. A nice video."
4,Well Made Christian Adult Contemporary Project,"Excellent vocals and inspiring lyrics. Produced by John Mandeville with excellent cast of session players and background vocals by Bob Carlisle, Cynthia Clawson, Angelo & Veronica, By Design..."
4,3rd disc is worth price of whole,Third disc contains last 2 shows of seried in entirety. Just wonderful.Whole set has very funny bits. Makes me sad to realize how much I miss Johnny. I just wish there were more whole shows available.
1,Best of Johnny Carson,"very poor effort on the part of the producers- it could have had more variety. I loved the show, but this was done poorly."
5,johnny,HEEERES JOHNNY what more do you need to know very funny!!!!!!! its a great video that you can watch over and over
4,One of the best,"Generally good, I was a little disappointed that It did not have more of Johnny's Monologs. I always thought that was the best part of the show."
4,Here's Johnny!@,"The news of Johnny's death really saddened me, as I always thought we'd hear one more xmas special or something out of him. Unfortunately, it seems, the networks rubbed him the wrong way, too bad for us. Otoh, I'm glad Johnny stayed Johnny till the end. I feel priviledged to have grown up watching Carson on late nights, he had a great personality and was great with people, and a great American, imho.Most of the footage I've seen in the various 'tributes' after his death is in this set, which kind of spoiled it, but still nice to see again. I never thought much of the last couple shows, the Bette Midler singing has got way way too much airtime. I wish I had a few taped episodes from the 70-80's. Here's hoping that we see some in the future, sure there'd be some money in that, lol. Hey Ed, you're great too. I'll have to look for some old starsearch episodes now."
5,"YOU MUST SEE 'THE GREAT FLYDINI""...THE BEST OF CARSON!","WE BOUGHT THIS SET AS A GIFT WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON FINDING THE SEGMENT OF STEVE MARTIN'S ""GREAT FLYDINI"" ROUTINE. THE RECIPIENT WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AND WE MUTUALLY DECIDED MARTIN IS A COMIC GENIUS...AND THAT CARSON KNEW AND APPRECIATED THE BEST TALENT ON EARTH. MAKES A GREAT GIFT OF LAUGHTER."
4,Beautiful knife,"I bought this knife for rabbit hunting. haven't got out with it yet to use it tho. It arrived fast and in great condition. Its a very nice looking knife and very sharp right out of the box (you can shave with it, no problem). Its very small which is just what i was looking for. I have never owned a case knife but if this blade holds its edge which from what i see in quality so far and case's reputation it will, i can see more case knives in my future. I took off 1 star for the sheath. Its's good quality leather but is a awkward design. overall great knife for small game"
1,Disappointing,"I love Georgette Heyer's books, particularly her later ones. This book was such a disappointment. It was tedious, with unlikeable characters and no romance. The book never seemed to build to a climax just dragged on. Do not buy this book - look for The Grand Sophy or The Reluctant Widow."
1,Cheap,"When I took the dice out of the head I noticed they had a greasy substance on them. When I wiped the material off the numbers went with it. I don't mind that it's a cheap sort of game made in China, as long as it provides its utility (improving my 9 yr old's math skills). However, finding a mystery substance on a kids game, and said 9 yr old's hands, was disconcerting enough to me to provide a 1-star rating."
2,8 yr old hates it,"we never played it once -- she looked at the pieces/parts, tossed them under the couch and went to her coloring books instead"
2,On the other side of the spectrum....,"It's almost as if ""How to Operate With A Blown Mind"" and ""Don't Be Afraid Of Love"" are made by 2 different artists, or at least thats what it sounds like. There are probably only 2 keepers on this whole cd, and they are still light years away from any song on ""How to Operate..."" The only reason I am giving this cd 2 stars is because of songs 3 and 11. This is one of the very few cds I have purchased in the past 2 years that I regret my decision afterwards."
5,More excellence from Andrew,"Have you thought about moving beyond your recreational dive training but would like a ""sneak peek"" into where you might be headed? Have you progressed in your diving to where you know that the skills you were taught just don't feel right and you know in your gut there must be a better way? This DVD is an excellent resource for you. I also recommend the recreational video from 5thDx, too. Andrew's videos are so good and his technique so refined that if he put out a DVD of him underwater reading his grocery list I'd buy it."
4,Another view of the judiciary world,"This book provides another view of the Judiciary world the author has created. It is no less intense and interesting. I enjoy reading the story and the moral choices that the main character has to make. Although I was eager to read the continuation of the story line from her previous books, I am glad that the author broadened the scope of her fictional world. I hope that all of these plot lines are going to join togather in the near future. Great job."
5,Magical!,"I have just finished another of Karen Kay's spectacular romance novels, The Princess and the Wolf. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I think Amazon should do something about that other author writing a review on a book she'd never read. I only wish there were a Karen Kay fan club. If there was, I would surely join it.This book takes place not only in America, but in Europe, also. And yes, it is a Native American romance.I intend to read all of Karen Kay books."
3,Barbie blossom DVD Player.,I had this for about 10 days and I have to return it pretty sad about it because I have the matching TV I have to think if I will buy this again or a different one...Amazon always is very friendly and nice customer support.Nothing is broke on it but it just stopped working for no reason.Really sad about it :(
2,:(,"this ""used"" dvd was not working but I recieved a speedy, full refund.. Although I was asked several times to remove my negative review which was kind of strainge bc reviews are for letting future consumers know they are purchasing!(MY PREVIOUS REVIEW) """"disapointed in this dvd player. It makes so much noise when trying to play a dvd. Its also very bulky and kept turning off. you have to manualy open the player to change a dvd. I would not recomend this to anyone. It will be difficult for kids to figure out!"""""""
1,barbie DVD,Got It for grandchildren for Christmas and my daughter Just told me that it don't work at all. The DVD player is new
3,Black Sergeant Murdered,"This play is an okay mystery. It is not much of a page-turner, but it does leave you wondering who. This play is about a black sergeant who has been murdered by one of his fellow peers and the ongoing question throughout this whole book is whodunit. I found this play a little interesting, but also a little disturbing at times because of the racist content. Overall this play can be described as a mystery of a killing at an army base where everyone is considered a suspect."
2,Fans of the TV series will like it.Horror fans will be bored,"This book stays close to the series. There is no deep character development, but it really doesn't matter since most of this part is covered by the TV series. Apart from this, what we have is a good guys Vs bad guys tale, with the Ancient Egyptian Deities as evil Demons and the good Christian God as the Saviour. The Legacy is confronted by an evil conspiracy and tries to recover a lost manuscript from the bottom of the sea. There are some decent gore scenes, but that's all.Fans of the TV series will like it. Horror fans will be bored."
2,The pepper-ist thing I've ever tasted,"The actual meat was fine. The problem with this product is the quantity and strength of the pepper. It burns your mouth there is so much of it. I had to use a knife to scrape the pepper off of the surface before I could stand to eat it. Also very salty. If you love pepper or can't taste pepper, then this might be for you."
3,Did not like the taste,"My wife and I travel and like to take Jerky with us for snacks as it is easy to pack. We recently bought 5 different packs to sample to see which one we wanted to order in bulk. I must say I was not a fan of the Buffalo Bills Jerky. First it was not very tender, second the taste was just a little bit off and left a bizarre after taste. I felt that overall it was too hard and too sweet for my taste."
1,Ally McBeal: The Complete Series,I pre-ordered the Ally McBeal: The Complete Series. The product information indicated the format was in NTSC. Does anyone know if this will play in the United States - Region 1? No one seems to be able to give me an answer.
4,Revisiting the Past,I really am enjoying this DVD even though I thought it was goingto be in color..I guess I'm still not understanding how the infois reading about the products..but all in all it's a great DVD it'sbeen a blast to go back to the past to shows from my childhood thatmade me laugh!It's very refreshing to watch these shows w/o all theprofanity that theses comedy shows are producing these days.I feelsorry for our young kids today who were not fortunate enough to growup with these shows.Maybe if we had these shows back again andintroduced them to our kids maybe just maybe the world would be abetter place.
5,Excellent service,Thank you. Excellent service. I've been looking for this DVD for such a long time Finally at last it has surfaced.
2,MCHALES NAVY S-1,"Yall did a great job getting it to me, it looks great.yall kick but, keep doing it."
1,A big disappointment,"Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel. This is a novelization of the filmscript. The graphic novel is one of the finest examples of the genre. This is uninspired, derivative and dull!"
4,Good coverage.,"I have not seen this issue tackled in a comprehensive way before, especially one that actually looked at the reasons behind our rhetoric and why do we care about privacy, and why do we sometimes not care."
3,Just received it and I'm excited:),I admit I just received this book today but I flipped through it and I am so excited to get started. There are so many good ideas in here. There are a few that I couldn't care less about but overall... excited.
3,It is not what I expected...,"Maybe I expected something else from this book...so far by just browsing through it, I had not found anything that I need to be able to make use of the suggestions that are here..."
4,Quality Glove,"This is a good-looking, quality-made glove. The glove is waterproof and very adjustible, keeping snow out of the cuff. My hands have never gotten wet wearing these gloves, making them breathable as well as waterproof. The one possible downside of the glove is its amount of insulation. Though it keeps my hands dry, my fingers have gotten cold while skiing, though I am sure that this is because skiing doesn't involve a whole lot of hand motion."
4,Elite,"The four greatest american baritones of all time, each singing some of their most legendary recordings. Highlights are: Tibbett's Largo al factotum, Thomas's Nemico della patria, Warren's Prologo, and Merrill's Brindisi from Hamlet. Infact anything Tibbett and Thomas sing is bound to be fantastic, especially as their operatic recordings are a little harder to find these days. Its a bit sad that most opera fans dont seem to realise what a massive impact they had on singing in their day, and especially in tibbets case, acting. Warren and Merrill are both phenomonal (although Merrill occasionaly can sound uninspired) but their recordings are much more readily available on different recital cd's and compilations, and you may have them already, which is why i took a star of a full 5 for my review."
1,Hit and miss quality,"Twisted off 2 bolts of 6 that I tried to use these nuts on. They start ok, but seize up half way down the bolt. After using a 1/4 inch tap and die set on the nuts before installing them they work ok, but that is a lot of extra effort. Obviously many of the nuts are not properly threaded."
5,works well,"My husband ordered this to maximize his cameras potential. No complaints, so I guess it does what is is supposed to do!"
4,dan the man,well there is one thing i have to say for something made in Taiwan i have to say this i a nice tool i am a marine and don't like non american tools one thing is most of the products that are made are china or taiwan and this tool is better than expected i was suprised at the speed it works one thing i have to say is the plast on the handles should be rubber but you get what you pay for the tool is a nice quality tho
4,a good product,Delivery time is as promised. There is no instruction booklet or any kind. I tried and found that if you want to strip out more plastic then you need to take out the red plastic gauge in order to get a longer strip.
4,So far so good,"I've only used mine a handful of times stripping of 18 gauge wires for my trailer lights. One thing to note, you MUST dump out out the stripped insulation or it won't grab right. And as others have said, there are no instructions at all.The little brass knob is to adjust for the size of wire I'm sure, but I have no clue how to adjust it."
4,Well worth the money,These strippers are fantastic. I would have rated it at 5 stars but there are no instructions with them. I am very happy with my purchase and bought my son a pair. He shares my enthusiasim.
4,Auto wire stripers,"Well, they have striped all the wires I have tried, oh, 1mm to 4mm, and I have done up to three wires at once, but its tough to get them to all strip. Two at a time is definatly not a problem if you get them even. The crimpers on them are worthless as you already have to pull against springs to close the crimping section, they are about 2-3 inches below the hinge; being between the handles it is very difficult to get the wire to stay inside the connector while positioning it on the crimper.The construction appears solid, and the wire cutter works alright. The real beauty is not having to position the wire in a certain slot and with one quick pull, the wire is striped."
3,Don't bother if you have the first edition,"I agree entirely with bruen@mit.edu. I am giving this book a ""5"" because it's a must-have 10 if you don't already have a copy of the first edition, and a worthless 1 if you do. I haven't examined my 2nd edition copy thoroughly, but a quick comparison shows the text to be identical to the first, even down to the pagination"
5,For curious on criptography history,"Big book. Great, as expected. The very first part of the book seems quite separated from the rest. It appears as a long introduction, probably too much detailed. The rest of the book is written in clean english understandable also for non mother tongue readers."
4,"great content, so so writing style","This book is the meat and potatos of this subject. I know of no other book which attempts or even reaches for the scope of this one. The content is quite fascinating, but I find the writing style to be slightly distastefull.If this book were written today, the writer would be roasted for his lack of racial sensitivity in the first chapter. As an American living in Japan, I was repulsed by the tone with which the author treated Japan as a nation and as a people. Since that seemed to be the standard in 1967, perhaps I cannot fault him, yet by my standards, I found the tone revolting. Was this material not revised in the second edition to preserve the style of the original edition or just to display the author's prejudice?Other than this, the author's stories and anecdotes often help the reader navigate what might otherwise be very dry material."
1,Worse Thesaurus I've ever seen!,"How can this book have been compiled by a Ph.D? It si too thin a book to be useful! There are better pcket-size books. AND, I would hardly call this pocket-size because it would embarrassly stick out of your pocket!As I said, there are much better books out there!"
2,A very poor reprint,The reprint of this wonderful book of prayers was amateurish. Don't buy this reprint. Try to find a better one.
4,Fast-moving and clever whodunnit,"Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond is nominally the star of this murder yarn, but it's the clever plot and the crisscrossing story lines that keep the reader engrossed. Briefly, we have an attractive psychologist, who happens to be a police profiler, strangled while at a heavily populated public beach. It turns out she was profiling a murderer, dubbed the ""Mariner,"" who taunts authorities by announcing his victims in advance and leaving about passages from Coleridge's ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner."" So Diamond and his colleagues are involved in unraveling two murders simultaneously. The novel moves right along to an exciting conclusion and should keep the reader guessing until the last few pages. The writing is literate and unobtrusive."
5,A FEW WORDS,"N. Kazantzakis:""I know well that death cannot be conquered, but man's value is not measured by the Victory, but from the fight for Victory itself. And I know as well this, which is even more difficult: its not the fight for Victory - its only the value of the man, and is this: to live and die gallantly and to not condescent a reward. And further this, the third, which is even more difficult, the certainty that there is no reward should not scare you, but fill you with joy, pride, and bravery..."""
3,Thermostat,"This thermostat is shown as a vdc, however when you get it it is standard vac. Amazon subsitutes a White Rogers. Now the real problem is if you use this in a RV and hook it up it will be fried and you own it. Well I was wrong. now I went to the White rogers web site and the data sheet says 24vac or dc. The printed sheet that comes with the unit has nothing about dc, so I hooked it up to 12 vdc and it works!"
2,this novel is not what it wants to be,"The strain of Weld's prose was uncomfortable after a while- the effort of ambition, not artistry, is evident in this novel. The love scenes were gruesome in particular- the dialogue that is used to express a young man's sexual desire, one of the most natural scenes to encounter in art and life, is here made irrevocably awkward and discomforting. My sense of the author was of a man who thought that writing simple thoughts down simply, and in relatively short sentences, was enough to make him the new Hemingway (he miscalculated). I also puzzled at the author's photo that accompanied his bio on the back cover- is the anxious look upon this man's face spotted with snowflakes supposed to remind me of the politically conscientious Redford? It looks more likely that he lost a cow in the snow off-camera."
4,Good for small microwave,"This is a nice little bacon tray. The only thing is a full long piece of bacon doesn't quite fit on the tray. My microwave is not big so I tried this smaller one. I had to cut the bacon so that it would fit. So, if you are looking for a full size, this is not the one"
5,We LOVED this movie!,"My wife and I saw this film by chance in a independent theater in Seattle. The whole theater was laughing, and I must say that it was one of the most charming movies we've ever seen. Now, we're avid fans of Chris Smith, and are awaiting his next film."
5,Punk at its finest,"This CD should get more than 5 stars! I say that not only because its a good all around CD, but because ""Live For Now"" and ""Religious Scam"" are on it, and those two songs are two of the most amazing ever writen. The lyrics have meaning without being preachy or coming across as meaningless pseudo-intellectual garbage, and the music mixes street punk with a bi of hardcore and thrash to create one of the hardest street punk bands out there. While The Casualties are good in their own way, A Global Threat is the best band out there. Go buy this, now."
1,Do Not By the Penguin Edition!!!,"There are dozens of different versions of this book, and they are all DRAMATICALLY different. Do not buy this ""Penguin Classics"" edition!!!!!!!!!It is horrible! All the good parts have been ""abridged"" out of it.This is one of the silliest ideas I ever heard-but Penguin apparently tried to ""clean up"" Casanova. They have removed most of his stories about seduction from his auto-biography! Since Casanova was the world's greatest lover, I don't know why they think anyone would want the book except to read about seductions but those are exactly the parts they took out!Only Penguin could make Casanova boring.Buy a different edition of the book!"
5,omar-you have competition!,"Can't get enough of this.Class voice, class music and polished performance. A professional artist is the making. I can't wait to see him live - his musical arrangement entices you into a feeling of intimacy. Hypnotic - I love it."
3,Read for narrative voice,"The story itself is oddball and at times a blend of the wild and carnivalesque. What you will read this for is not the story itself as much as the unusual narrative style, describing a character that never really speaks for herself, creating a character out of testimonials and feelings of others rather than the central character herself. Worth a read for that reason alone."
2,Hard to catch on,"I, too, had a hard time grasping this novel. I was much more ""with it"" in the beginning when identity and religion were being discussed, but I found myself having a much more difficult time following the rest. It seemed jumbled; I was re-reading passages over and over again because the text wasn't subconsiously ""gripping"" enough for me to remember and follow what was going on."
5,Possibly the best waffle iron out there--Ingenius!,"My old waffle iron broke down about 4 months ago, & I had spent that much time searching, searching, for the perfect waffle iron. I found it! First, you've gotta love the gorgeous looks of the stainless steel exterior. Second, I've always preferred the deep, Belgian-style pockets, especially in a round shape, which this iron has, but what a bonus!!!--reversible plates to give you the extra-special heart-shaped waffles. And because the plates are reversible, they are REMOVABLE, so you can actually immerse them to wash them, & even put them in the dishwasher! That is such a fabulous feature. Finally, I am just thrilled with the results--the waffles themselves are light & crispy, SUPER-EVENLY cooked, simply perfect. They cook quickly, in about 3 minutes, & do not stick at all (even when I overflowed the batter.) In short, I cannot say enough good things about this iron, & there is no reason to buy another kind."
1,This book will drive you crazy,"As a parent, I do not like this book. I have two boys and they both love it. They would read it every night If they could. I find it very frustrating, on most pages there are more things wrong they the number they ask for. For instance, if it say 4 things are wrong, my boys usually come up with 6-7. I have tried to donate this book to charity several times, but my boys will not part with it. I just don't have the heart to get rid of it without their consent. Your kids will love it, As a parent I don not recomment it."
5,All Time Favorite,"Wacky WednesdayBy Dr. SeussThis book has been one of my family's all time favorites. When my children were young, they asked me to read it over and over, while they tried to spot all the wacky things. When they learned to read, they read this book again and again.Whenever anything out of the ordinary happens in our family, we still say, ""It must be Wacky Wednesday"".When my son became a father, this is the first book he bought for his son.Children will love solving the mystery that is called ""Wacky Wednesday"".Jill Ammon VanderwoodAuthor: Through the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)"
4,A Favorite in Our House,"I have to admit that I only gave this four stars because, even though it is a huge favorite of my daughters, I get really tired of looking through it again and again. Some books I love and would read everyday, this one bugs me for some reason.But having said that, the book is well done. It's all about waking up and finding weird things going on in your house and on the way to school. The story line tells you how many oddities you need to find in the illustrations on each page and the text is pretty easy for a beginning reader to get through.Even though we have read through it tons of times, my daughter still loves to find all the things wrong (knowing that she's found them many times before)."
2,Incompatible,I bought these thinking they would work for my 1st Gen iTouch or 5th gen Classic. Neither managed to get sound but my 5th gen iPod managed to show the menus on screen. This cable didn't exactly come cheap given what it does (or in my case doesn't do).
1,Very disappointed in this seller...,I have waited and waited and waited...It has been over 3 weeks - and not a word..now I hear that Amazon is 'still trying to contact the seller'-wouldn't you think that this seller would let Amazon (and us) know if they do not have the product?!! This is just wrong - wrong - wrong - I would never ever trust this seller again....and you shouldn't either :-(
2,Review,Nice pictures. Not a lot of advanced details or product information. More of a beginner book.
2,"ok, somewhat helpful, but not great","I did not like this book. Although parts of it are helpful, like the hair section, I didn't like the costume section. I think that it would have been better if it gave a few costume suggestions rather than just the one. It did show a few photos of other dolls, but it seemed to more showcase the artist, but did not say what or how she did things to them. It's ok for a beginner book, but I have seen better. I wish it would have gone over different looks, rather than ""make this doll that you see on the cover"". Also, the doll used isn't widely available like Barbie dolls. The vinyl and hair are different than what is normally used. I just did not like it..."
4,Excellent to the last note,"Definitely a MUST BUY for fans of Slowdive. To put it in context, I place it a notch above Just For A Day and a notch below Souvlaki on the goosebump scale. It's easy to close your eyes and imagine it as the elusive Slowdive album that never appeared after Pygmalion was released. Additionally, Monster Movie blows rival siblings Mojave 3 out of the water musically - no contest.Every song is great, and best of all it withstands repeated listenings beautifully. I never get tired of it."
1,Unreliable,"I had this type of Panasonic trimer for several years. I decided to get a new one, but it wasn't working from day one. I got another one. It worked for a few days, and then stopped working. I was surprised that a Panasonic product would be this defective. IF it is working, it works great."
1,Unusable,"I was hoping for an alternative to scissors, but no. It doesn't really cut very much, it's so tickly and irritating that I find it unusable. If it did a better job actually trimming I might be willing to put up with the discomfort, but in the end it's all pain, no gain."
2,Just barely works....too slow and frustrating.,"I've had this gizmo for many years. It's far superior to the mechanical unit that I had before that didn't cut at all. This gizmo has worked fine and has never failed. However, it just won't cut the hair. I have to buzz and buzz and buzz to get the job done, which really only should take about 5 seconds per nostril."
3,you get what you pay for,"I found this product just OK...trimming is not as clean as I would like, but it was very inexpensive. I doubt I would recommend this product to my friends, however, since the whole point of a trimmer is a nice, clean trim."
3,Compact & works but bites a bit,"This is a good item for packing in your toiletries for a trip, being more compact than its bigger brother the ER415SC which I prefer. But it is not quite as effective and also it bites (pulls) periodically, but does the job."
4,Works well,"I have an old food processor that I have used for many years. This is a definite improvement over that one. This has many attachments and I LOVE that it has different speeds. It has a large capacity bowl. My only complaint is that the pusher doesn't push all of the product and I end up with a big blob of whatever I'm processing at the end. This may happen with all processors, I don't know as this is only my second one to own and work with. Overall, I am satisfied with it."
4,Braun Food Processor,So far I'm really pleased with this product. Would have given it 5 stars if a recipe book came with it. Especially like having a small and large bowl. Easy clean-up. Does not move on the counter when using it as some of the other reviews mentioned.
5,It Goes To 15! Friggin' Awesome!,"My husband did a bit of research and purchased this as a Christmas gift for me. I thought I LOVED my 25 yr old Cuisenart and was so sad it was about to expire, especially after reading reviews of the new ones, because I use this machine almost every day. However this Braun turned out to be a dream machine! It has features I didn't even know I needed, until I used them. Love the veritable speed control and the no leak work bowl, not to mention the quiet and super quick speed of the motor. It's so easy to assemble and clean and even though it takes up more counter space, it's so friggin' awesome I would devote an entire counter to it if need be. I plan to order basic replacement parts now, so I can have it for the next 25 years!"
4,Good customer care,I think this food processor is discontinued but there are a couple of things that I would have liked to know before I bought this. The manual says that it is dishwasher safe but we stuck it in the dishwasher and it warped the lid so that it wouldn't go on anymore. I called customer care who blamed it on the dishwasher but let off when I pointed out that the manual says that it is dishwasher safe. They don't stock replacement parts so they had to be ordered from [...] on my dime and then they reimbursed me. It worked out really quickly but I wish they could have just sent me a replacement.All that said I would recommend air dry in the dishwasher!
5,A great inspiration.,"An innovative and creative approach to designing with colour. The use of Clive Nichol's stunning photos of Hadspen Garden combine perfectly with the witty and informative text of Nori and Sandra Pope, who are also the gardeners at Hadspen. The publishers are to be congratulated for producing a book that will change the direction of garden book design."
3,Prince & Showgirl,"A fun piece of cinema.....Intwerested in seeing it after watxching My Week With Marilyn. One would have never known from watching this older film that Ms.,Monroe was such a problem to work with....enjoyed the movie and happy to have it in my dvd collection."
4,Luv this movie,The movie is great - vintage Marilyn. The quality wasn't so great. I even tried to view again in 24 hours and it wouldn't play at all.
1,Wasted talent.,The movie was not funny. It was not engrossing. I turned it off. Poorly directed. A very weak story. Over acted.
3,Amusing!,"This is a very amusing film! If you like a romantic comedy, this is great. However, Monroe isn't very succesful in portraying Elsie Marina, the actress who falls for the duke. She is charming in some parts, but she overacts too much. Although not his best work, Olivier is great as always!"
1,Don't buy this product,"I am really disappointed with the performance of this product. It is poorly designed for operation. It requires that you keep your finger on a pulse-type on/off switch while you are also pumping a handle or pushing down on a plunger in the feed tube of the machine. The blade that blends the ice cream with the additives does not turn fast enough. The directions say you need to have very frozen ice cream. Well, they mean frozen like an ice core sample dug from the Arctic! I started with what I thought was rock hard ice cream and that was too soft. This product is a waste of money. You could achieve the same end result by blending additives into ice cream by hand."
2,Broken after three times,"I am very disappointed with this machine. I used this machine three times and the motor stopped working. I am currently in the process of receiving a new one from the company. Also, a 1/2 gallon of ice cream will only get your four servings. The soft served ice cream is good but not worth the money I paid for it."
4,Great music and performance,"I do wish some tech wiz would clean up these recordings. It's the 21st century, and we all know it's possible. I'd even pay regular price for such a product."
4,is this a best of?,I never heard of this album but I see all their popular songs from olther albums on it
2,Not that great,It hurts when I used it on my nose hair. It doesn't last that long either for the price that I paid because mine is now broken. I bought it within 2 months ago and I barely used it too. I should have bought something else.
5,Works like magic!,"Works like magic! I tried it yesterday and it's just perfect. My nose is ""sparkling clean""! I didn't mean to disgust you, though."
2,Good while it lasted....,".... which was not very long at all. As a nose trimmer that was operable, it cut very cleanly and without much irritation. The motor on this device however, decided it wanted to quit far too soon. No motor, no trimmer."
4,I admit... I thought it was a gimmic...,"I had my doubts when I ordered it, but I was tired of drawing blood trying to trim myself with a barber scissors, so I decided to give it a try!To my surprise, this trimmer worked perfectly. It works equally well on nose and ear hair, and is also ideal for trimming the occasional whisker on the chin or lip that gets missed during shaving. I've used it for 2 months and am still using the original set of batteries.So if you're tired of hacking yourself up with a scissors, give this a try... you won't be disappointed!"
5,"No joke -- it works and it's cheap, too","It's hard to keep a straight face when discussing the personal grooming solution this little wonder offers -- but the bottom line is it works. Really.There may be some who have mastered the art of using scissors to remove nosehair, but I'm not one of them. No matter how hard I've tried in the past, I've never been able to quite get the job done. Not even close. And I figured the $15 price tag was worth it if only to satisfy my curiousity about how these things actually operate, or at least be good for a laugh or two from my wife or kids.Well, it's no joke. Yeah, there's a minor tug or two during operation as some have noted, but the inside of my nose is as smooth as a baby's bottom. My advice is to give it a shot. What have you got to lose? Well, other than the obvious, that is."
5,good grooming necessity,"I brought it for myself due to it was under the gold box sale, and the prior grooming object was barbaric and hurt from pulling the nasal hair. This doesn't pull the hair. It cuts the hair no pain involved at all I was so impressed with it. I bought 2 more for family members. it is awesome and only one battery and it can be immerse in water. Now I look forward to my hair growing :) and knowing I will look my best"
3,Good Product but... Life line doesn't seem far....,"This product is great to have.but after 1 year of usage, it finally broken down... it didn't even have the chance to renew the battery.Total usage 5-6 times in 1 year."
1,hair trimmer,Terrible. Cuts very poorly. The older units (with a split head) worked well. This version doesn't.
5,"Great trimmer, smooth, effective","I have nothing but the highest regard for this trimmer. It does a great job. I was worried after reading the reviews about it pulling hair, however I did not experience any pain, it is smooth and effective. Easy to clean and use."
3,Wish blades would stay sharper,"Purchased 11/06. Still working ok, just wish the blades would stay sharper. It still gets the job done, it just takes a few ""going overs"" to get it right."
1,Poor performance,Pretty flimsy. Motor spins erratically and is fairly weak... when it slows down it pulls hairs.
4,Nice tool,It functions nicely. But one does need some time to feel confatable using it...it makes you itchy.
5,I can breathe clearly now.. The hair is gone..,"I never thought I had a need for a hair trimmer of any sort.. I've never seen hair in my ears and I have a full mustache that blends in right up to my nostrils.. However, after shaving my mustache off, I noticed my nose hair was a little longer than I'd expect..I read the review for this product on Amazon and wondered how so many customers could speak so highly of a nose hair trimmer.. That was until I received mine today and put a single AA battery into it, turned it on and began to use it in less than two minutes from its arrival..This has to be the most effective means of getting rid of your unwanted nose/ear hair that's actually fun, safe and semi-enjoyable (for the tickling effect)..If you're hairs are going astray and if you're having a bit more of a difficult time breathing than normal, try this product out.. You will NOT be dissatisfied.."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,This trimmer was to be a replacement for my aging trimmer of the same make & model. This trimmer does not trim close like the old trimmer. I am very disappointed in the product!
1,Broke after two uses,"This kind of grooming item is not used very often. When I went to use it the third time, it would not work. I tried changing the battery, but the problem is with the unit itself. It's never been dropped -- it just stopped working. I am attempting to get Amazon to intervene and replace the unit. I'll let you know what happens..."
2,Not durable,"It worked fine for a year. Then I dropped it onto a rug in the bathroom. Not on the floor, a rug. It immediately quit working. Busted."
1,Painful,"The first one of these I received painfully pulled hairs as it cut them. I ordered a replacement which was slightly better, but had the same problem. I would stay away from this model."
1,"Hurts, breaks way to easy!",This thing really hurts. Not a pleasent experience at all. Broke after the first few days. Save your money.
3,"Worth-less, not much bang for the buck","2 Stars is generous but I gave it 3. Pros: Looks nice, is comfortable in the hand, battery life is good, never pinches and is relatively quiet. Con's :(the reasons you want a nose trimmer are not solved. It misses many nose and ear hairs as they do not seem to be directed into the slots easily and takes much time since it misses so many and doesn't cut them short enough (it is why there is no pinch). You can hear it working as it slows the blades, but you look and still see the ones missed. Frustrating! Seems like there has got to be an efficient model that is powered. I may end up with the well rated manual model. I feel it is not worth the money and there is a good chance of disappointment."
1,More Junk for the Landfill,"Mine stopped working after a few months. Now it resides in a landfill somewhere. (*sigh*)To replace it, I bought an all-metal, mechanical nose trimmer from Vermont Country Store. No batteries to wear out, and no cheap plastic to break. It works just as well and, best of all, it cost the same price!"
1,cheapo,"i bought this flimsy tool and it just stopped working after about 8 uses. The price is so cheap that i guess this should be listed as a disposable groomer, hehe."
3,Not as good as its predecessor,"This is my 2nd Panasonic model. (I dropped the last one after 2 years, and it broke.) This new version is identical except that they've added a plastic thingy in the middle, to prevent hairs from catching/pulling. While this is a nice gesture, it means you have to really work harder to get some trimming done! Multiple passes and odd angling are now the norm, and I'm disappointed. This new version is quieter."
4,A Sweet Story,"True to the Angelina stories, this focuses on the role of a leader and how to treat others. Angelina models effective problem solving techniques while providing children with an engaging story. The range of age groups represented (Henry, Angelina and Miss Lily) also allows children to view the situation from a variety of perspectives. The story is a great conversation starter for 5-6 year olds: ""What would you try next?"" ""Why do you think she reacted that way?"" ""Why are they upset?"" My [...] daughter and [...] son can both enjoy this video."
5,It is what it is,A cable is a cable and if it works it is good. This works for its intended purpose. 2 more words were needed
1,Stay away from this one,"Cheap construction- connector end came apart in my hand first time I tried to use it- I was able to snap it together and make it work but the cable has a cheap feel. The tiny plastic cap isn't attached to the cable like most decent cables, and will be quickly lost. Buy a better cable."
3,"capresso coffee pot, coffee not hot enough..pot sounds tinny","I was disappointed that the coffee wasn't hotter and the pot sounds ""tinny"". I ordered it because it has a pause and pour feature, caraffe, and the last one I had was excellent. If I still had the box I might send it back."
5,Superior Coffeemaker: Capresso 440 MT 500,"I pride myself on being a coffee afficionado. Nothing but the best beans for me. I needed to get a replacement coffeemaker after my Cuisinart 12 cup began to leak. Based on the reviews I read, I decided to go for a premium Capresso 440 MT 500. I was not disappointed. The controls are easy to use, and the coffee brews fast. Most importantly, the coffee tastes great--far superior than tasted through my Cuisinart brewer. The water head seems to cook the coffee more thoroughly than my previous coffee maker. Also, the thermal design keeps it warm and not bitter for three hours. The standard gold filter provided is a nice touch. The Capresso coffeemaker is definitely worth the money."
2,Serious quality control issues,"I will keep this Short. The carafe broke the first day. I returned it and got another one. The second unit imparted a horrible bitter, burnt rubber sort of taste to the coffee, and it never got better after a few months. I returned that one too. The machine had great potential and looked stunning, but I would not recommend it due to quality issues."
2,Capresso pot lid is defective,"I like this pot, it brews a great pot when it's all cleaned out ( I use baking soda, some Borax and a scrubby brush), but the carafe lid does not come apart for cleaning and is clearly filled with coffee gunk. I shake it and brown gunk comes out, but I'm sure there's some left in there that is then dripping into my coffee. Please fix this lid, make the whole thing easy to clean with no hidden gunk places.The price was steep for a partial stainless, partial plastic machine."
2,Capresso 440 coffee maker,"Just bought this for the advertised price of $140. VERY disappointed.....filters only last 3 months, it is very easy to misplace the coffeepot on the plate and have coffee spill all over, have to tighten and untighten the cap to pour and brew, and someone certainly could have done much better for their money. Would advise you check out the Braun metal carafe 10-cup coffee maker.....we had one for 6 years (making at least 2 pots/day) and wish we'd stayed with it now......one touch control (off-on), filters last 3 months, very simple pour mechanism with no changing cap position for pour or brew."
1,Missing Items on delivery,"Item arrived with the coffee machine box inside of the shipping box. Coffee box had been opened and all warrenty, manuals, and literature on the coffee machine had been removed. Makes you wonder if the item is NEW as advertised or been retuned by someone else."
2,Good Coffee - Big Headaches,"Everything is just fine until the one day it overflows and ruins everything. It's good coffee, so you let it slide the first time and take more care to line everything up perfectly. Then it happens again...this time you were sure it should have worked. And it just happens to be the day when you pressed start and walked away. Coffee is everywhere. Grinds are everywhere. Your morning is ruined.DONT DO IT. Buy something else."
3,"Good machine, small and costly to operate","We are serious about our coffee and this machine makes good coffee. It also looks nicer than any other coffee maker we've seen. We were surprised that the machine makes about 1/3 less coffee than other 10 cup coffee makers. For this coffee maker, a cup of coffee is 4 ounces. It also requires about 1/3 more coffee grounds to make the same strength coffee as other coffee makers. It requires 1 tablespoon of finely ground coffee to make each 4 ounces of strong brewed coffee. That said, it does make good coffee and seems well made compared to other machines we have tried. Our experience is that none of these machines are really finely crafted machines. Next time we will try a different brand that makes more coffee with less coffee grounds and might be less expensive."
5,wonderful coffee and looks nice on my counter,"I bought this coffeemaker to replace another Capresso coffeemaker that I have used almost daily for over 8 years. It is still going strong and still makes great coffee, but my kitchen is all stainless steel and I decided to treat myself to an upgraded look. This pot is really beautiful and has a few improvements in design - the plastic coffee filter holder is sturdier, and the all steel construction is even better at keeping the coffee hot for hours. Plus, it looks expensive and I found the price at Amazon to be really great. (Added comment several months later - I used the my old Capresso coffeemaker last month when I had Christmas dinner and needed a second coffee pot to make enough coffee. To my surprise the old Capresso made much better coffee - richer taste and used much less coffee. My guess is that the new Capresso is much faster so the water goes through the coffee grinds faster and therefore some of the richness is lost.)"
4,Don't believe the negative reviews,"I wanted to upgrade my old Capresso and was hesitant to buy this one because of people's problems that they mentioned in reviews here and on other sites (spilling, etc). I have had none of those problems, and threading the top onto the carafe is NOT hard. The coffee does pour out more slowly than other coffee makers, but its not a deal breaker. This thing makes the best home brewed coffee I think and also looks nice, which does matter! I gave it four instead of five stars because of the slow pour issue and also that it calls itself a 10 cup coffeemaker but really they mean 10 cups of one cup mugs. The average coffee mug holds more like 2-3 cups, so this maker is not great when making coffee for more than 3 people. It does keep coffee hot for HOURS."
5,"Nas hasn't fallen, off he never did (part 1)","Nas new album is red hot. Nas is like has the streets bumping right now. And Hate me Now featuring Puff Daddy shows nasty Nas isn't dead. Those the only two rap songs I heard along with Dr. Knock Boots until I get the album April 6. I heard he got a song with my girl AAliyah. Nas is the best rapper out there. He has never fallen off believe that. I hope Nas, AZ, Nature and Foxy Brown come out with a tigher firm album in the year of 2000. And please settle this beef with Cormega."
3,Kind of a dissappointment,"Nas's new CD, I Am... is really worse than I thought. There are only a few good songs on the album (Hate me Now, It's a Small World, and maybe a few others). Of course, if you disagree, I am perfectly fine with that, but I really think that I Am... is not a very good CD. In fact, I think DMX's Flesh of my Flesh Blood of my Blood is better."
2,Nas to my @$$..,"This cd sucks. Joints produced by DJ Premo are dope but the rest of them iz wack. Hate Me Now is the worst song i've heard in a while. There won't ever be another Illmatic. Exit Nas Escobar! C'mon, enter NASTY NAS!! This moneymaking cd ain't worthwhile.. This album is even worse than It Was Written!!"
2,$$$$$$,$$$$$is that all nas thinks about?? he makes a song about pac and biggie for the money. he knows it will sell. nas lyrics on hate me now blow and the appearance of puffy just makes it a joke. he should go back to te old days and not just think of tha money.
2,Pretty pitiful,I thought this album was going to be better. This is simply the worst album by Nas. Don't waist your money on this one. This sucks!!!
3,"Lyrics are great, but some tracks can be skipped.","After seeing all the great reviews this CD got from fans online, I went ahead and purchased this CD. I must admit, although I like some of the tracks on this CD, I think "" It Was Written"" is a lot better. I cannot listen to this entire CD without skipping some tracks and for me, that means "" I Am"" will not be in rotation in the CD changer. NAS, I'm disappointed."
5,this is the best rap cd!,this is the best rap cd of all time(well maybe not but its really good)nas is a great poet but he raps his rhymes. just get this cd! especially if u r into rap! share ur thoughts with me
4,A'ight,"Pretty good album, but can't touch Illmatic. Da best joints were: Nas is Like, Undying Love, and Small World. I dont get all this Hate Me Know hype. If you're a fan of Nas, pick this up, but if ya wanna hear him at his best get Illmatic."
2,His last album was a lot better,Come on man! Let's be honest! The CD only has two tight songs to me. The duel with Scarface is the best track. If I could I'll return the CD back.
2,Overrated!!!!!!!!,"Nothing against NAS, I respect him and what he stands for, but this CD is a disaster if you take away a couple songs (the DMX joint). It has no flow at all and just plain sucks."
4,Wonderful Campy Horror Movie,"Let me first start off by saying this...do not see this movie if you are expecting a serious, epic horror film. It's not that at all. But for fans of campy movies such as those old monster movies, then you will love this! Also, Stacy Ferguson (Fergie, from Black Eyed Peas) has a short little part in the movie, she's in like the first scene. It's kind of weird seeing her so young, since I never watched Kids Incorporated. But, all in all, a good movie for campy horror film fans!"
3,Features Carroll Gardens footage from 1974!,"Wow! Some really cool scenes shot in Carroll Gardens,Brooklyn in 1974(back then it was just known as Red Hook). Watch especially for the scene on the corner of 1st Place and Court St, there is Sergi's Candy store (now known as ""Thakor Brothers"" newsstand), then the reverse angle across the street and we see the ""Brand New"" Citibank which is still there! You can also see ""The Pub"" on the corner of Carroll St and Court St. That's not all! The next scene is shot on the corner of 2nd Place and Court St. You see a nice shot of the old ""A & P"" Supermarket, and the old fashioned lamp post that used to be on the corner! For other cool Carroll Gardens movie scenes see ""The Idolmaker"" from 1979 (nice shots of Luquer St and Smith St and Nelson) and the brief scene in Goodfellas shot on W 9th Street and Smith St."
1,DISSATISFACTION,When it had not been shipped after the shipping date you specified I wrote you and cancelled the purchase.
4,A good performer,"First, the facts, because they're hard to find and ought to influence your decision:-- There are a dozen settings from 2 mm (1/12"") to 18 mm (3/4"").-- The battery should run the unit up to 40 minutes.-- A full charge takes 8 hours.-- The manufacturer estimates the battery will last about 400 uses.-- The cord is five feet long.-- You can remove and replace the knives.-- You CANNOT replace the battery: once it dies, you throw the unit out.Some comments, in no particular order: The knives are really sharp. The shape of the head gives you good control. You need to pay attention to the charging; you shouldn't leave it plugged in more than a couple days at a time (""this may damage the batteries""). An occasional oiling and cleaning is recommended.I'm happy with the performance and the quality, but this one gets only four stars because you can't replace the battery. We do, indeed, live in a throw-away society."
1,Hate it,"Not worth the price. Awful. Sheds terribly. Washed once and had to throw away because it shedded so much. Cheaply made, but price wasn't cheap."
1,junk,THESE ARE MUCH THICKER THAN THE REGULAR ROLLS FOR DENI. THEY DO NOT WORK WELL AS THEY ARE TO THICK TO GET THE AIR OUT OF. A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!
5,Moving and thought provoking,"I really loved this gentle movie. Not only does it allow us to begin to care deeply for the Dabney's ....a very coarse, unrefined poor southern family...but it let's us see them through the eyes of a privileged child as well.It's message is pure and simple....yet so moving.Unfortnately it is not a movie for children to view, which is too bad because it has such beautiful lessons about love to teach."
1,"""Touched the heart""",Would like to have a copy of the movie score. Great music! Is there a soundtrack?
4,"A touching ""Southern"" story.","I enjoyed this movie very much. I am still thinking of it days later. It had a cast of characters that were delightful. They came across as very human and kind, despite their often slovenly, and crude style of living. It had a little more profanity than I care for, but at least it was in character for the roles. The little visiting boy was delightful and the caring they all showed Shadrach was very moving."
2,Just missed being a great movie,Maybe they should have spent just a wee bit more time developing the charachters and less time on the foul language. Without the foul language it was a pleasure to see. Nice story.
2,Scooby lunch box,I returned this. I didn't like that you have to pack the food in through the back of the van. It was very hard to get anything in it and you would have to take everything out to get at stuff you put in first. It was very cute and wished it was designed like other lunch boxes and opened by the whole side of the Mystery Machine.
4,My son's first lunchbox.,"My 4 yo started preschool this year and I let him pick out his own lunchbox. Of course he picked out the most expensive one at Toys R Us ($14.99). I don't know what the red thing is in the picture because ours didn't come with that and I checked out several of them in the store to make sure that we got everything that came with the lunchbox. Ours just had the bottle and some coupons in it.It is a really cute lunch box and has held up well so far. I'm glad I let my son pick it out himself because I never would have chosen this one. I would have thought he would like Spiderman better, but he was adament that he had to have this one."
1,Outrageously overpriced piece of junk,"The zipper catches on the lining every time it's opened and closed. I don't know why it's called a ""kit;"" it comes with nothing. It's just the bag. $14 for something that is hard to use and cost probably $.50 to make is ridiculous."
5,saved the day,My 3 1/2 year old loved this lunch box. He calls it his prize and keeps his treasures in it and uses the sport bottle for water on his nightstand. Well worth it as happy as it makes him.
5,This is one that will make you think.,"Nieto did a fantastic job handling this subject and I love how challenged I am by it! It really causes you to think very deeply about multicultural education and the sociopolitical factors that come into play.The case studies are the best part of this text, though. I love the fact that there are follow-ups in the back of the book for several of the kids!Even if you think you know all there is to know about multicultural education, you will be surprised by how much you learn from this very well-written book."
2,Cumbersome,"Perhaps to compare this novel to its protagonist, Kate, expecting her baby and feeling very encumbered is trite, but it is apt. I felt that Phillips wanted to have her cake and eat it too -- she wanted someone young, 31, but this is a baby boomer woman, not anyone who is 31 today. Yet she attempts to give it an 'anyone/anytime' feeling (the ability for me a the reader to place the story chronologically was very difficult) which only distorts from both the 1985ish story she is telling and trying to ""place"" this novel in a contemporary time.Frustating, from start to finish. This is a woman who made her name writing about her generation, with all the gifts and burdens that come with it. Perhaps she was simply trying to do to much for too many."
1,Awful,"I am furious that I wasted my time reading this book. The characters are vague, impossible to envision, and prone to terribly boring dialogue. The plot has almost no forward movement. Phillips seems to expect that the symmetry of her extended birth/death metaphor will carry the novel, but it doesn't come close."
2,Vacuum brew and some shortcomings,"Not the prettiest coffee maker in the world, but my wife seems to enjoy the coffee's flavor.My two gripes:In order to get to the desired coffee strength, I have had to increase the amount of coffee, as compared with the old coffee maker.Also want to add that this thing is a pain to clean."
4,Don't sleep on this!,She is sooooo amazing. Her voice is deep and different. She can hold a note and even sing well off key. She is so under rated. Please listen to her cd. She has been slept on for real!
3,It is just so so,"The stuff was not terrible, but I have some issues with the listed price. I think when I bought the book, it said the original price was like twenty something dollars, but on sale for less than [...], so I thought that I must got a great deal. It was not true. I later bought another book for just [...] for my daughter. It is much fancier one and even came with the marker. If the stuff costs more than [...], I'll suggest to look else where for a deal."
3,It's Aiight,"It's a cool movie all about hip hop. But the strangest thing is that it doesnt have enough rhyming in it though. They also mention the two words ""Hip Hop"" sooo much. But check it out if you can, just don't rush."
3,"Average Hip Hop Movie, Good for true old school Hip Hop fans","Brown Sugar was an average file mainly because I felt Taye Diggs was not the right person for this role. He is not believable as a hardcore underground hip hop lover. Basically, he is not ""ghetto"" enough for this role. Sanaa Lathan was excellent in her role as a music reviewer. The plot was predictable and the reference of using ""hip hop"" as a metaphor for love is somewhat refreshing. The best part was the beginning when some of the legendary hip hop artist revealed how their love of hip hop began. The insight to their love of hip hop is very interesting. Its not great but it will keep you entertain for the evening."
4,good quality for the price,"This kit will be OK for 90% of roadside emergencies. The jumper cables are thin, but they arent intended for everyday use. Other stuff is OK, I supplimented with some extra tools & fixaflat."
5,Convenient,"Having a can opener, bottle opener and knife sharpener in one convenient and attractive package is fantastic! This appliance looks good on my counter top and takes the hassle out of opening cans and bottles. It's tall enough for coffee cans and with its automatic stop when it completes opening the can I don't have to stand there and wait for it. This was definitely an excellent buy."
2,Meh,"I thought these were a great idea, and they smelled amazing, but...they were kind of lame. Sharp-tasting, and because they were so big, they didn't melt all the way through when I toasted them, so I had to kind of eat off the outer layer and re-toast the marshmallow a few times before I finished it. If I were to get them again, I would probably cut them into quarters, but that seems like a lot of work for a stupid holiday gift."
5,"Two stories for the price of....er, two. Both great though.","'The Visitation', with its historical setting, well-thought-out plot and strong characters, is well worth seeing. The aliens are interesting, the robot is well-designed and the explanation for the Fire of London is a nice touch. 'Black Orchid', the first truly historical Dr Who story since the sixties, is filled with lavish sets, there is a genuine sense of mystery and suspense, and the idea of Nyssa's double is a good one."
5,Power of The Sword is Powerful,"As I have always said Wilbur Smith brings me the taste of Africa all the time. I am in Zimbabwe and some these things happened so close to home such that when you read his books it is like you have rewinded history. Mr. Smith's knowledge on mining, banking, firearms, politics, love, hate, the African wildlife and research is too good and accurate to be fiction. I have enjoyed the Power of The Sword such that I almost forgot about my exams. His twist and turns, plots and sub-plots are excellent and I am looking forward to the next book in the set. The Poer of The Sword is very powerful."
3,LAMEST DVD PACKAGING EVER!!!,"I haven't bought this set yet (I can't--I am writing this on 8/14/05, two days before the official release date) but I did get a chance to look at the packaging for this set this morning...and well, look no further than my review title for what I think about the redesign of the Simpsons DVD series. While I'm not so anal retentive to demand that Matt Groening use uniform packaging for each and every last season of the show, this particular set is going to look downright retarded sitting on my DVD rack. (And I will buy it on Tuesday--don't judge a book by it's cover, and don't judge a DVD by it's stupid, crappy packaging!)"
1,disappointed,"I really hope there will be another presentation for this season, otherwise I won't be able to buy it simply because it WON'T fit in my collection with the other five seasons! this yellow package doesn't look like something you can store and then collect at all."
1,The Box Needs WORK!!!!!!,"The season of Simpsons was GREAT! Except for the ""STUPID BOX"" sure it looks cool, but is was poorly made. The disc case inside mine fell apart when I opened it and the places where the glue is supposed to be came apart. Honestly This Really Ticked Me Off. I think this was a stupid marketing ploy to get you to spend the 2.00 to get the standard box sent to you. Remember when you do they will have your mailing address, as if you don't get enough junk mail. UNTILL THEY DO IT RIGHT IM BOYCOTTING SIMPSONS BOX SETS...SHAUN"
3,"""Worst Packaging Ever!""","... in the words of Comic Book Guy. These are the most poorly designed packages ever (yes, even worse that Northern Exposure).1. They don't stand up on their own.2. The back piece of cardboard doesn't stay on after you open the package.3. The plastic is flimsy.4. The DVDs fall out if you don't have 3 hands to open it.5. The cover can't be closed again without the booklet sliding halfway down and getting folded in half.The saddest part is that they knew how much it sucked (put in the insulting insert) and went ahead and did it that way anyway. I think it's rude of Fox or whoever green lit this box to take advantage of Simpsons fans by assuming we'd buy the DVDs even if they were wrapped in a hot turd. But then again, we probably would. Perhaps this is all just a plot to get people talking about the packaging instead of paying attention to the decline in episode quality? Nah."
2,"Episodes - ""A+"" .... Packaging - ""F""","If it weren't for the episodes I'd be giving this a 1 star rating. But I can't bring myself to do that because this was one of the best years of the show IMO. But this plastic Homer head that falls apart once you touch it was a bad idea. And calling people anal retentive just because they want something sturdy that will protect their DVDs is really out of line.Hey you Fox marketing ""geniuses""... If you had limited this silly head design to a special collector's version and released the regular boxes to the masses in the first place, you could have saved yourselves (and us consumers - who pay your salaries, by the way) a lot of time, money and aggrivation. So drop the sarcastic attitude and just admit you made a mistake.Save the gimmicky packages for action figures and sex toys."
5,WOULD EVERYONE GET A GRIP,"1) FOR PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT THE BOX IS DUMB BECAUSE HOMER'S ON IT, I DO NOT AGREE WITH YOU. THAT PART IS FINE.2) FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY EVERYONE IS AN IDIOT BECAUSE THEY HATE THE BOX ART, THEY ARE THE IDIOTS. GET A GRIP! PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THE BOX ART AND WANT TO EXPRESS THEM.3) FOR PEOPLE THAT SAY THE BOX COVER IS FLIMSY, MADE LIKE A DISNEY MOVIE'S BOX, AND SO ON, YOU ARE COMPLETELY RIGHT. IT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA.4) ONCE AGAIN, EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THIS SEASON'S COVER AND ARE REVIEWING THEM! I WISH EVERONE WHO ARE YELLING AT THE PEOPLE FOR DISLIKING THE FLIMSY PACKAGE WOULD GET A FRIGGEN GRIP!!!!"
1,Thanks to prior reviews,"When I saw this many people on Amazon complaining about the Season 6 DVD's of The Simpsons, I had to raise an eyebrow. When I read that they are Simpson fans and that the complaints were uniformly about the packaging, I have to wonder what Fox was thinking. Really, Fox? You want to screw over Simpson fans? They are some of the most loyal fans you've got. Thanks to the poor consumers who posted on here. I will wait to buy this set until they fix the packaging."
2,Forgot the Funny,"With a few exceptions, the shows from this season just are not funny and are not nearly of the quality I've come to expect from the Simpsons. Whether their writers all left, or the talent left the writers is a mystery, but the best jokes are ones we've seen in earlier episodes."
1,Content: GREAT / Package: WTF?!,What can I say? The content of the DVDs is great as one can expect when buying 'The Simpsons'.But the packaging. What is that all about? In order to get to the DVDs you have to carefully remove layer after layer (but careful...very delicate stuff). It takes no end.But to get that thing together again without breaking it? Really tricky bit.Certainly a back fired marketing-idea....
1,Great Content-The most insulting Packaging ever :(,"Just got the new simpsons set and i am really mad. sure, the box looks cool but it's made of that type of cheap plastic that kid's halloween masks are made of and you know how long those last. But that's not what I'm really mad about, I'm mad that I just spent $35 and as soon as I got home and opened it, a flyer falls out, telling you how lame FOX is and they knew they were so lame that they had to add insult to injury by insulting YOU instead and then asking you to give them $3.00 for the box that should have come with it to begin with!!! I wish there was some way you could really make your voice heard about this most grievous of customer insults. I know when I send my check in, I'm gonna include a not so nice note but I know it will end up on the mailroom floor. FOX IS LAME IN EVERY RESPECT except that they own the Simpsons."
3,"Great Season, Terrible Packaging.","First of all, this is a great season of ""The Simpsons"", I love every episode, and the features on these DVDs are up to scratch with the other 5 season (although, the commentaries on this season are becoming less informative and more rude and opinionated).However, the new packaging on this season is flimsy and inconvienient. First, the outer-shell is made of very thin brittle plastic. And once inside, the plastic cases for the DVDs are tacked in with a small amounts of glue, and quickly fall off. All in all, not a pleasant experience getting to your DVDs. But, once in the player they are great.So, 5 stars for the DVDs, 1 star for the box = 3 stars."
5,"Great season, horrible packaging","The Simpsons is the best TV show ever. This season is also one of the best. The previous DVDs all had great special features. These factors made me really look forward to this set until I saw the packaging. Instead of a normal and sturdy case like the previous seasons we have a cheap plastic thing that falls apart after about a week. The people at Fox at least new that people wouldn't like this change so inside is a slip so that you can order a case that looks like the old ones. But why do this? Wouldn't it have been more simple to just release it in the original style then spend the money on two kinds of packaging? But for whatever reason Fox will release at least the next four seasons in this kind of cheap case. They better have a replacement for those too, because I can't stand having a misshapen and cheap DVD case that quickly falls apart. This season gets a 5 from me, but make sure to order the old style packaging once you buy it."
1,The poor packaging decision ruined this set of DVDs,"I love The Simpsons and have been an avid fan of this modernized version of the Flintstones since seeing the small snippets that appeared on the Tracey Ullman show in the late 80's.That said, I despise the packaging."
4,the best yet,Its the first time that it would be release in different packaging. And news that in season 7-10. the other family members head will be the packaging.COOOOOOOOOOOOOL
5,The Best Simpsons EVER...,"I love this collection. Nothing is better than ""Clown College"". Best freakin' episode ever. I'm really surprised I didn't get this box set first. Get it. Enjoy!"
2,in poor contion,the cover of the discs was falling apart but the disks played well and were not scratched or other wise damaged.
2,What's there to say?,"The Simpsons are The Simpsons.It's a great show. All seasons from up until the 2001 seasons were great. So I can't say anything bad about the shows in the season.What I can say is the packaging. That royally got me mad. I have all of the previous seasons on DVD, and I'm very anal about keeping a collection the same. Same boxes. I mean, when I bought this anime series when it came out, I had one that didn't have the collectors cover, and it drove me nuts until I bought another one. I want the same packaging. When you collect a series it should be the same. Shame on the fox company for ruining my collection. Shame.Shame . . ."
3,DVD box came DAMAGED!,I am a fan of the jersey shore but I was extremely disappointed when the DVD box came damaged -.-
4,Entertaining,I bought this mostly bc I liked the drama. This show is good if u want entertainment not if u want a show with a brain. But it's still a good buy
5,Still going strong after 6+ years,"I bought this in August 2006 and have given it a pretty good workout. So far it has performed very well - much better than I expected given the price paid for it.As with any carbon steel wok seasoning is critical. A well-seasoned pan is as stick-free as teflon, but you don't need to worry about the coating peeling off due to the high heat, or have to use plastic/nylon tools so you don't scratch it. Seasoning is not tough to do - there are clear instructions provided with the wok, and you can find tips galore on the web.Keeping it seasoned is also important. Don't use soap to wash the wok - just use plain water and a scrub brush, and clean it when the wok is still fairly hot. Once clean, put it back on the stove and fire it up until all the water has evaporated. Every once in a while swab the hot wok with an oiled paper towel.The handles are strong - no wobbles whatsoever as of yet, and I tend to be a bit spirited when it comes to stir-frying.Highly recommend!"
1,Not Happy,"It seems everyone loves this wok, but I didn't have a very good experience with it. I have cleaned and seasoned carbon steel pans in the past, so I know how to do it. But, the factory coating that came on this one was impossible to remove completely. I thought I had it cleaned off, after following the directions and scrubbing and scrubbing. However, the first time I cooked with it, the places where it simply wouldn't come off burned and turned sticky. I ended up giving it away."
2,Doesn't season well,Unfortunately I was never able to use this product. I received the wok in March and seasoned it according to the directions so that it would be ready for the first use. I put it away and when I went to use it the first time I was shocked to see that the item had rusted :(. Unfortunately by the time I discovered this the time to return or exchange had already expired. Sooooo disappointing.
2,factory coating very difficult to remove!,"After boiling water in this wok for an hour (twice) & scrubbing, I still could not remove the factory coating. Plan B is to buy lacquer thinner!"
2,was not very well made,"did not like the seat cushion, it was cheaply made and it did not last long at all, the lumbar support did not work at all"
3,A good bad B movie.,"This is one of the better B suspense movies I've seen. Plus I'm a Marc Singer fan, and if you are too, you'll probably like this. Lots of sex, but that's to be expected from a film of this caliber. I don't think it detracts from the movie's suspense. Did I miss something? What role did Tippy Hedren play? I didn't notice her, but then, it's been a while."
3,Could've been better...,"This movie had potential, I thought it should've been better, but nonetheless it was fairly entertaining to watch. The main character is also the director, he probably cast himself because he'll never be in anyone else's movie. Yes the acting was pretty poor, except for Christopher Walken, Chazz Palmenteri, and I even bought Ricky Schroder's part. Mike Massey the champion 9-baller and trick-shot pro makes a cameo. The pool sequences are mostly quick cut-and-zoom, and fast editing which takes away from the look and feel of the shots. There are a few nice shots in the movie though. Overall the plot was not original, but it was OK, but there were several uneeded sub-plots and characters. The movie just gets downright cheesy in some parts. Even after all that, for reason I was able to overlook the mistakes and enjoy the movie. Maybe because I just like the whole pool hall atmosphere?"
5,This one almost slid past me.,"Well, having seen both the Hustler and The Color of Money, I thought I knew what this movie was going to be all about. But to put it bluntly, I was all wrong. This movie was almost an anti-hustling movie, it has to do with a kid who had the chance to make it big in the pool world but was used by his manager to make money in the back-room tables. Then Fast-forward to his adulthood and how his only skill is pool and how he must return to the hustling ways of childhood to ""save-the-day"". All in all, a very entertaining watch, worth the money to see in the theatre, rent or even worth buying."
5,poolhall junkies,"great movie, i'm glad i found it on here, because i couldnt find it anywhere else. it came promptly and in excellent condition. i was very satisfied with this order."
3,THIS THING CANT CHARGE TWO BATTERIES SIMULTANEOUSLY!!!,"I buy this thing because it was with special discount, practically the same price with SONY ACVQ50 that haves SQ technology but only one slot for one battery. The other unique difference is that the ACSQ950D have the plug and cord to connect to the cigarette lighter for your car. I was surprised when i read in the manual ""This unit cannot charge two battery packs simultaneously"", so compare price between the two chargers before buying. That's my advice."
1,Beware,"This may be a good charger, I have no way to know but it was of no use to me, I bought it with a camera and tripod; it was listed as a recommended accessory. PROBLEM: this charger works only wth ""M"" series batteries. The camera I was sold works only with ""L"" series. This accessory is not compatible with the item it was recommended with. BEWARE the recommendations!"
4,Better on Blu-ray,"I played a DVD copy of ""City of Vice"" on an inexpensive Blu-ray player I recently purchased from Amazon, and the picture quality of the series is excellent! What might look dark on a DVD player is remarkably stylish, even beautiful, on my Blu-ray player."
5,nostalgy,"One of our greatest singer.You have to understand french to truly appreciate him, his lyrics are joyful and sweet.I particularly love ""qui est kid"" and ""fou d'elle"".sous le sunlight des tropiques and on va s'aimer still make french people, kids and adults, dance 'till dawn :)"
1,Includes amazing warranty expiration detector,"I like to shave in the shower, and Panasonic's wet/dry shavers seem to be the only available choice. They do work great . . . until they fail spontaneously. They have the most amazing warranty expiration detectors. Every Panasonic shaver that I owned managed to fail within 3 months after the warranty expired.There are two varieties. The cheaper shavers have a clip-on charger. On those, the clip will break. The more expensive ones use an induction system. Those will simply fail to charge after the warranty expires."
2,Carafe is Faulty,Water somehow accumulates between the outside metallic cover of the carafe and the inner glass liner. It leaks out the seam at the bottom. Someone else reported the same problem. The coffee maker works fine for me except for this.
1,Waste of Money,"Do not waste your money on this item, it is the worst I have ever seen related to anything, let alone UFO's"
5,Perfect Sudoku Book,"This book is very well thought out. The puzzles are big, with enough room to sketch in numbers, and there is plenty of room in the margins for notes. The paper is opaque enough that the puzzle on the other side doesn't show through. I like how the the different level puzzles are shuffled for variety. For something different, there are circular puzzles, and killer 16 x 16 grids. I think that this is the best sudoku book out there."
2,Book,"Very confusing book - all about rules for ringing ancient church bells, with a murder mystery thrown in.haphazzardly. I wanted to read something written by Dorothy Sayers..but definitely not this!"
5,Bunter begins,"Ian Carmichael at his best playing Lord Peter with grace and dignity and a wry humor that makes even Peter's most aristocratic excentricities enjoyable. This tale is another great mystery filled with brilliant deductions, unexpected twists and shocking horror and it reveals the relationship between Bunter, the most redoubtable man since Jeeves, and Lord Peter. Some actors paint a character with such definative strokes that it can never be played again. Robert Newton took a role that many of the greatest actors of the last century atempted and made it his forever. We all know what a pirate sounds like because of Newton's Long John Silver. Ian Carmichael is Lord Peter. Powder your plams, roll up your sleves, take a sip of strong brandy and get ready, you have many hours of pulling if you plan to complete that Triple-Bob Major"
4,Solid British Detective Work,"Sayers has much to offer the British mystery aficionado. Indeed, readers of that genre must inevitably read Both Sayers and Christie for their engaging characters and well constructed mystery plots. This one would be enjoyed most by anyone who fancies bell ringing. It may not be the best example of Lord Wimsey, but it's not bad."
3,Bell ringing - really?,"I had seen this mystery some years ago and my memory of the bell ringing was very slim. I thought the book spent entirely too much time on the bell ringing without really explaining what it involved. I am a professional musician so I did have a slight knowledge of the way these bells are rung, but I admit to some confusion about the different patterns of ringing. I enjoyed the book - somewhat - but the emphasis on the bell ringing did confuse me a bit and I thought it slowed down the progression of the mystery."
5,I keep buy these again and again and again...,"I've been buying these UCO beeswax candles for several years now. If you have a UCO candle lantern or Uco candelier then this is the best candle for all purposes. I bought the UCO candle lanterns and candelier for hiking, camping and for emergencies. The beeswax candles are the best bet for your lungs and the scent of the beeswax is... well... in my opinion sweet and soothing. They do seem to burn for a very long time compared to the regular white candles and I do highly recommend them. You won't be sorry!"
1,Why the shape?,"Seriously. These things look like a trio of beeswax dildos. So goofy, I bet plenty of stay at home moms buy these."
1,more like five hours of burn,Not the best beeswax candle have ever owned. It is suited as a lantern but does not burn 12 hours. use it to heat tea on a camping trip. I did not use it that way but now I find out that is basically what this product is made for. I was going for the scent of beeswax and air toxin cleaner that it is known for but the scent was mediocre to poor. Thanks for nothing.
2,WRONG PART SENT,ORDERED PART FROM THIS SELLER AND WAS SHIPPED WRONG PART. WAS TOLD THERE WOULD BE A 20% CHARGE PLUS THE COST OF RETURN SHIPPING TO THEM. THEY SENT THE WRONG PARTS AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE SHIPPING AND 20% ON TOP OF THAT.
4,"titiyo,something new-something fresh","i just knew the single track, but when i heard the rest of the cd, i had to achieve: sounds good (every track on cd!mixture of soft hop/hip hop,even soul... buy it"
3,Good charging Unit,Just got this product. Charged several batteries and it work just fine. So far so good. I like the blinkning charge light that comes on and letting me know that it is charging.
1,TWO DEAD BATTERIES,"TWO OF FOUR BATTERIES WERE DEAD AT FIRST ATTEMOT TO CHARGE THEM. ""One Year Warranty"" requires $5 co-pay plus SHIPPING which makes the WARRANTY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE TWO WORTHLESS BATTERIES"
1,Don't buy,The batteries are no good and the charger itself is crappy. Zero stars and I would recommend that you get a charger and rechargeable batteries but just not this one.
5,Far superior to regular rechargeables,"I had never been a big fan of rechargeable batterys, since they discharge so quickly after a full charge. I had also never been familiar with this type of rechargeable battery. Trust me, these are immensely superior to regular rechargeables and the price was fantastic when purchased with my Canon Powershot. Anyone who buys a camera and can get special savings on this battery pack is really missing the boat if they don't take advantage of the offer. The batterys charge up faster and last so much longer. Definitely worth the cost."
1,DOA,"I bought it, charged them, etc. But they never worked. Not sure if it was the charger or the batteries, just returned them for a refund."
1,Doesn't work for me,"The charger and/or batteries are obviously defective on the unit I received.The green ""charged"" light comes on even when there is no charge in thebatteries. Leaving the batteries in the charger for as long as a week seemsto make no difference - the batteries will charge up enough for about 3 shotsin my digital camera, and then - nothing. This seems to be a very hit-or-miss product, based on other reviews."
1,Doesn't charge - useless,"We ordered this unit along with a new digital camera, and could not get the batteries to charge at all, so obviously it is useless. The unit is clearly not operating properly. I am in the process of attempting to contact their support department and will follow up more with what transpires, but am disappointed that this unit was not properly tested prior to shipping."
1,cheap junk - doesn't work,bought as part of a package with a camera - batteries would not charge sufficiently to activate camera. Not worth headache of return - good reason to buy locally from brick and morter store at similar price
4,"Probably not complete, but close enough","This book got me up and running with my PIC 18F4550-based PICDEM FS USB board very quickly. Microchip includes code for this device, but USB Complete helped me make a little more sense of it all. I think some more diagrams would help clarify the USB protocol more. For a beginning USB developer, everything you really need to know is covered in this book."
3,"Not as ""Complete"" as I hoped","I was really wanting something that would show a step by step guide to building a USB device (even if all it did was turn on and off an LED) but this book doesn't really show how to actually BUILD anything. It's more about the principles/standars for USB from both the hardware and software side, and some examples on how to connect to and use an HID USB device."
4,"Note to previous reviewer - ""he"" is a ""she""","This isn't the first time I've seen this assumption, but having been on mailing lists with Ms. Axelson, I can tell you Jan is a she, not a he, as the previous overly negative reviewer said. ""Complete"" comes from the title of a previous book by this author on RS-232. Admittedly, that term is probably over-reaching, but it beats Intel's lousy ""DBE"" on USB."
3,Not sure how to rate this product,The book is comprehensive but lacks USB Concept Design methodology. I recommend adding a section to cover Testing and Testing platforms.
5,Great starting point,"This book is highly recommended considering it's depth and range of content. It offers lots of practical information and is easy to read. The website that supports this book is also very helpful. If you are interested in USB, this is the first book to read."
3,this is for host programers,"This is a good book if you are a host programmer and need to kow the dirty details of USB. But if you are looking for a practical circuit and a practical GUI you are not going to get it. Most devices takes care of the protocol within the hardware designed in the device so we really dont need to know all of the details that this book covers. If you plan on using USB for a hobby project and need quick, easy examples to get started that are specific to lets say a PIC dont buy this book. But if you need to know how USB works but dont want to read the boaring USB spec buy this book."
2,Superficial USB book,There is an awful lot of text in this book most of which is the regurgitation of platitudes or common knowledge. Not a lot of real in depth knowledge or insight here. I found this book to be an extreme letdown.
3,MIXED EMOTIONS,"Really fun to read, but written with no distance at all from its subject. Bockris presents wife-bashing, money loosing and heroin dependency with the same loosenes as his unbeatable talent as a composer. Good gossip and great quotes from Keef, but I missed information about his views upon his contemporaries (few Beatles references and no Kinks or Who quotes at all)."
5,He's For Real,"Entertaining and interesting look at one of the few ""legends"" that are one, for real, and two, still living. Richard's childhood, family, musical background, habits, drug excursions, and idiosyncrasies are described and explained by Bockris in a way, that makes ya love Keith Richards for the person he is, both musically and personally. Keith can play piano ballads from from 1930s by heart, in addition to being the foundation of the Stones sound, which is exemplified by his solo work and stints with ""The Expensive Winos."" I loved what Keith preferred for breakfast, as well as his food sauce that he had flown to many parts of the world where he toured. And, the Doctor says he's healthy. Richards doesn't appear to live the life of an accomplished rebel, he just lives life the way he wants to, regardless. Few can attest to that. So far he hasn't apologized for anything--and I hope he never does."
5,Jake and the Neverland Pirates,My son absolutely loves Jake so there was no question when his 3rd bday rolled around what to get for him. Movie is exactly what we were looking for!
1,DID NOT CONTAIN CD,We love the first season of Jake but we did not receive the combo pack with the CD. The reason I bought it here because it was a good price for the both of them but again I only received the DVD.
5,Great DVD!,"Bought this for my Grandson's 4th Bday, he just loves Jake, because his name is ""Jake"" so he plays Capt. Hook, what an imagination! Thanks Amazon for a great price on both DVD, & C/D~"
1,Does not work,I got this item as a wedding gift and the first time we tried to use it the whole bottom of the blender leaked margeritta mix all over our kitchen. Please do not buy this model! We couldn't return it either because we never received the gift reciept.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this blender based on these glowing reviews and I have been very disappointed. We use it nearly every day to make smoothies. Initially it was a strong, good blender but after less than 6 months it has lost much power, and it smokes and makes the whole house smell of a tired motor. My sister bought the same blender and has had the exact same experience (and she uses hers much less frequently.) I am already thinking of buying yet another new one, It goes to show that for a truly good blender, you must invest more than $30."
2,Not a tough blender,"I have used this blender for three months, making fruit smoothies three or four times a week. It simply crushed and blended a mixture of fruit, liquid, and ice cubes. It worked fine until the blades broke out of the base of the pitcher. The blades are mounted in a plastic plate, which is fastened to the base of the glass pitcher. That plastic plate snapped clean from the pitcher. The motor still works fine."
1,Terrible product!,The price was great at $14.88 but the hinges broke on the very first use. Do not buy this product! Cheap in price and cheap in quality.
1,Poor quality!!,I used one twice and hinges broke. Returned it. The same thing happened after one use. Junk!!!!!!!!! Not what Black and Decker used to be. So sad.
1,Horrible Product,Hinges break after 2 to 3 uses. B & D should recall all waffle makers and discontinue such a faulty product
2,Broken,"I used it once & went to close it & it fell apart. the screws(?) were made of plastic & one fell out broken & I tried to put it back holding it together & the otheer fell out, also broken. Package had been open when we received it, but my husband gave it to me anyway. B & D are usually good products."
1,Faulty Design,"This waffle maker shouldn't even be on the market anymore. We bought it from a store and should have checked the reviews before buying. One of the two plastic hinges broke on the very first use (after the third waffle). The second broke during the second use. Grand total: 8 waffles before the hinges were completely destroyed. Clearly others have had this same problem. How could a brand like Black & Decker even allow this to continue being sold?!? Sadly, I'd give it zero stars if allowed."
1,Can't get parts on this Belgian Waffle Maker. Unfortunately they use plastic parts and when the appliance gets hot they melt,"This is the most disgusting item to get any repairs. It can't be taken back to the store you bought it from, can't be serviced, can't be sent back to the company. So what do you do. Just spend money and get no results. I have given this company one star rating and letting you know I am very dissatisfied with your product."
2,Hinge Pins Break!!!!!!,"My hinge pin broke on one side during second use. I was still able to use to with caution, then within the year the second hinge pin broke, now unable to use. Seems to be a common problem!"
1,cheap materials used,Mine works great as far as the cooking part...THAT part I love. Over a short span of time the no stick finish starts to lose its no stick. Okay spray coating works on that. THEN both hinges broke. I was able to find one and glue that together (cheap plastic) the other was in la la land somewhere so I ordered ONE hinge. the cost plus the shipping was almost as much as a whole new waffle maker. I used it once after putting in the new and glued one...THE NEW ONE BROKE!... It had not been moved! Knowing the fragileness of the hinges I babied it. I only went to move it so I could put it away and the new hinge popped out in two pieces. Waiting for the glue to dry now...next time they break the whole thing goes in the trash and I will search for one with American made parts and hopefully metal hinges. You get what you pay for!
4,Waffles!!,"Works fine but you must use lots of Pam spray. Or else the batter will stick to the waffle maker. Other than that, good value"
2,black and decker belgian waffle maker WMB505,I received this waffle maker as a Christmas gift from my son and the little plastic hinge/pin that holds the two heavy irons together broke the 3rd time I used it. I am afraid that the electrical wires passing through this area would become pinched and electrocute me. This product is a lawsuit looking for a place to happen. My son bought it at Walmart in Long Island (and i live in Virginia)so a return without the reciept is an exercise in futility.Black & Decker WBM500 Belgian Waffle Maker
4,"Waffles come out great, clean up could be better",The waffles don't stick at all. The timer makes them very done/brown so I usually take them out sooner. Clean up could be better. There are some hard to get at spots. I use an old plastic card to dig out that area. No problem with my hing after a month. I would buy it again.
3,Bright enough...but very small,"These lights are a lot smaller than they appear to be, and also are not nearly as bright as other manufacturer's lights. These are inexpensive...but they should be for what they actually are."
1,No noticeable difference,This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself. The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed. Save your money....not worth the hassel.
1,Very dissappointed,"I purchased a 6 pack of the octenol mosquito repellent cartridges thinking it would help with the mosquitos. My Flowtron is large enough to manage an acre, and I only have 1/3 acre. I don't see many moths, but the mosquitos are as bad as ever. I was thinking of putting up another Flowtron on the other side of the house, but I'm not sure that it would do any good. I just have to bite the bullet with this purchase!The best part of this purchase is the way Amazon handled the sale from ordering to delivering - accurate, fast, and complete!"
2,Doesn't seem to work at attracting mosquitos,This item doesn't seem to work at attracting mosquitos into the bug zapper in the Philly area. The zapper works fine but I'd skip ordering this item.
5,Great book about hard times,"When I finished this book, I had to stop and think for a long time. It was a simple story from a kid's point of view, encompassing very difficult subjects: Poverty, abuse, and the biggie... race. When I was a kid in the sixties, it seemed like all the rules changed. The trouble was, no one had made up new rules yet, so everyone fought and posed and tried hard to survive adolescence, which is typical, only there was a feel of craziness in the air. This book caught it all, with honesty, humor, and unimaginable sorrow. It was a story that only Edna could tell, and Barry got it just right."
1,Identification,How could anyone review this and/or purchase this hub kit without knowing what the pitch circle diameter and the stud sizes of the hub are? Until better specs are listed I doubt many of these will be sold and many will be returned.
2,A tribute version of Pyle's books.,"This is a fine book for an introduction to Howard Pyle's works but is inferior to his unabridged, original texts. This is okay at best, horrible if you were expecting Howard Pyle's own work. None of Pyle's amazing illustrations are included. It's like a cheap, fake, imitation Rolex. Bear that in mind when considering your purchase."
2,Very little here,"This lousy film did have one solid sex scene and a good workout scene which both featured Shannon Tweed's outstanding nude body. Otherwise one of the worst films you will ever see. Tweed's films usually have laughable plot lines, this one was downright reprehensible. After the one good scene the rest of the movie is an hour of down time and tedium."
2,Dissapointed,"The very loose and hard to follow story line made for difficult enjoyment of the movie itself, too much of the kung -foo fighting for me."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Doomsday is fun to watch and Rhona Mitre proves more than capable of being a butt-kicking leading lady, but after a while Marshall's constant homage to/rip offs of better films (including but not limited to 28 Days Later, Aliens, The Road Warrior, and Escape from New York) start getting tiresome and I found myself wishing I was actually watching those movies instead of a second rate clone of them."
4,Leave your brain at the door and ENJOY,"What a gloriously stupidly great film. Yes it stitches up bits from Escape From New York, The Mad Max trilogy, a number of Zombie flicks and throws in a bit of medieval nonsense, but it's entertaining, silly, bloody, ridiculous FUN. It's one of those movies that if you `'get it'' and are willing to forgive it a multitude of sins, not least some woeful acting from Bob Hoskins and Darren Morfitt you'll have a whole lot of old fashioned exploitation fun.I mean in what other movie do you have a gleaming black Bently Coupe being chased by a rag tag band of evil punks in the cars from The Road Warrior all set to Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes. Great.Americans have not taken to Doomsday for some reason, maybe the audiences where expecting something serious and in the vein of Marshall's last film, The Descent, but Europeans who appreciate that Neil Marshall's tongue is firmly planted in his cheek are lapping it up. Enjoy"
2,Its all been done before.,"As other reviewers have already said there is nothing original here. If your looking for authenticity or realism in the action scenes you won't find that either. Rhona Mitra does make a excellent hard as nails heroine which is nice for once but thats not enough to redeem the poor writing and unresearched use of weapons and vehicals. There are excellent special effects and costuming but I found the excessive, unnecesary gore and violence to be a turnoff. Glad I didn't go to see this one in the theatres."
3,I'll Keep an Eye Out for You,You have seen this movie before. Post apocalyptic mission impossible with the spawn of road warriors out foxed by a tough woman with a bionic eye. It was weak. Lot's of action but weak.....
2,Disappointing,"The first 15 minutes of the movie set up a good premise. Not an original premise, but a good enough premise to build a decent movie around. After that, the movie steadily gets worse and worse. It reminds me of a sloping line graph how steadily the movie gets worse at it goes on because each scene is weaker than the one before it. It gets progressively more terrible until finally culminating in one of the most awful chase scenes I've ever seen.That climatic chase scene is just atrocious. Part of it is a car chase scene where you just want to tell the director that if he isn't going to take it seriously, he should do something else to end the movie. Lots of action movies are unrealistic. But the last 15 minutes of this movie crosses the line from unrealistic into something so absurd that it's almost insulting to the audience."
4,A good basic book on optics,"I had first read the book in college (Purdue). I was a physics major. It is a good basic book about optics. I now have a ten year old asking questions, and I use the book as a reference to explain things to my son. My copy of the book is the third edition. I am purchaseing the fourth edition because it contains the topic of Scherlerion optics. Sorry for the misspellings."
5,works great for me,"I bought this phone after being a loyal Motorola customer for years. After starting with a Nokia phone, I wanted a clamshell type phone, so began using a Motorola. I recently purchased this Nokia for the performance that I rely on from Nokia phones. I was not dissappointed. I am very happy with this phone. I purchased it 'unlocked' and have been very happy with its performance. I am a Cingular customer, and did not want to sign a new contract just to get a new phone. Great buy!"
2,not with out issues,the rubberized coating on this phone started peeling off the next day. I have stuck with nokia over the years because i love their menus and how they maneuver. This phone doesn't work the same at all...as far a i can tell there is no way to delete more than one text message at a time. when i put my SIM card in it doesn't automatically add the name to the number so the first week is moving the SIM memory to the phone which also wasn't as easy as my last nokia. and lastly the headset that comes with it is awkward in the least. not easy to deal with while driving so i roll up the windows and strain to hear the speaker phone. so it's sturdy and has good sound and signal but I won't be ordering a second phone to replace this one when it dies
4,You can't go wrong with Nokia.,"From one end of the spectrum to the other, Nokias are the best. I have this one as well as an e90 Communicator. You just can't go wrong with Nokias. The 6103 doesn't have wifi, but for a really simple phone, it's great. Unfortunately though, I bought my 6103 from Dr Cell Phone and it isn't unlocked as they claim."
2,My waffles stick unless it's dripping from oil,I haven't had much luck with waffles of late. Got rid of my former waffle maker (very similar to this one) because the waffles started sticking. This one they also stick! If I coat it generously every single batch (I brush on olive oil) then they mostly come off ok. Wondering if these only work if you use the spray oils (which I haven't had in my house in years). I also like to use alternative flours (like rice and millet) and they don't seem to work very well either.
3,Father of 2,"Not bad, but not great either. Difficult to clean and slides on the counter top when lifting the handle. Handle doesn't get hot but seems flimsy.Waffles stick and to cook any thing you have to be on the highest setting."
5,Beautiful Waffler,"After a lot of searching, I found the right waffle iron for me. I'm not a fan of Belgian waffles and searched far and wide before I found a waffle baker that makes the thinner version that I grew up on. I decided to go with the Black & Decker and I'm glad that I did. Sunday is waffle day in our house and this machine produces fine, golden brown, crispy waffles every time. I followed the directions and seasoned the surface first with oil, not cooking spray. I've had no problems with sticking or uneven color. They come out perfect every time. I'm very pleased!"
5,Excellent Waffler Maker,"I am pleased with this waffle maker! It's really like the ones our mom used, It's also got a lot of excellent features that make my life easier. It is the best one of all the others I have purchased recently."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"First off, it's a GRIDDLE and waffle baker, not a grill. And second, it's so poorly made that it's frightening to use. Mine fell apart while it was burning hot the first time I used it. I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,caution ver hot,"pretty to look at but omg, did not realize that the entire outside , including the handles,get so hot I burned 4 fingers, enough to get blisters on my fingers, just trying to put the lid back up, also the waffles are paper thin, I just put it in the garage, this one sucks, sorry"
1,Totally horrible cheap thing,"This waffle iron is terrible: heats unevenly, cheaply made. The clasp holding the bottom piece to the element is flimsy, so the bottom piece won't stay in place. Just an utterly crappy piece of equipment. Buy another waffle iron."
3,Hot Waffle,"This is an okay wafflemaker. You have to make sure it heats up for a fairly long time in order to get it hot enough to use, and even then it doesn't always heat evenly. The edges seem to take longer to cook. The indicator light is useless. It seems to go on and off randomly. The outside of the wafflebaker gets very hot. Watch out for plastic items touching the outside-meltdown! The grill is not effective for making things like grilled cheese. It squashes everything flat. You can remove the grates for cleaning, but I still find it difficult to get all the accumulated oil off (although I use very little, only a quick spray from the can of Pam.) I think the fairly high temperature of the waffle maker really bakes on that oil."
1,How did this ever rate so high,"What a waste of money, sadly ordered this instead of a good deep waffle iron, live and learn....Very flimsy, makes the old sunbeam I had look amazing..."
2,They don't build them like they used to,"Bought this to replace the old one I had that all it needed was new grill plates that I could not find, so I had to buy the whole unit. It is a little lighter than the old one and the metal seems a bit thinner, But what disappointed me was that it did not cook evenly. When the front was nice and crisp the back was still not done so I would have to flip my waffle around to finish cooking. I kept it for the fact that I like the setup of the unit, but the performance needs some work. I think I'm going to take the heating unit out of the old one and put it in this one and see how that works. Its sad that corporations have traded quality for profit."
5,Fried Chicken and Waffles,This is THE waffle maker if you want to have fried chicken and waffles. Also excellent for making waffles you can freeze and reheat in the toaster.
3,Different heat,This has a hotter top than bottom. This makes grilling sandwiches and baking pancakes a nuisance. OK for waffles. I replaced it with a griddle used on a burner and it works much better.
2,Disappointed with waffle iron,We are disappointed with this product. The waffles cook unevenly and they are smaller than we expected. The grill/waffle plates are only secured by a small spring clip and they have a tendency to fall out while they are heating.This is definitely not the quality I expected from a Black and Decker product.
4,Good Value,"After reading the previous reviews, I decided to try this waffle maker. Be sure to season the grill, as instructed, each time you use it or the waffles will stick. I found that using a basting brush and about 2 tsp oil works perfectly. This product is a good value and I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,JUNK & POOR CUTOMER SERVICE FROM BLACK-DECKER,Very poorly make. Made in China. Hinges broke and missing out of the box. waited for over a month for parts... Several calls later... was told parts are no longer available.They wanted $7 handling for warranty return and me ship the waffle maker back.How are they to warranty this for two years if the don't have parts?Save yourself some trouble and look somewhere else besides Black and Decker.
4,good grill,"The product is good. The picture of the machine on some site showed me bigger waffle plates which is why i chose this. However, this one is the regular size machine with 4 waffle makers. Anyway, thats the only thing bothering me. Otherwise its a good machine. The waffles come out very nice."
4,Great gift idea!,I bought this item as a gift for my mother. Easy to remove grilling plates make for easy clean up. Makes 4 waffles at a time. The love the chrome surfaces. My mother loved it. I bought this item in 2009 and my mother has never had any problems with it.
2,Disappointed ...,"I was excited to find the Black & Decker Waffle Baker. I've been looking to replace my mom's 50 year old waffle iron for some time. Lots of research, lots of price ranges. The Black & Decker was made exactly the same. Try to find a ""traditional"" non-belgian square, 4 slice waffle maker is hard! I've seen the others in stores and frankly, they looked cheap!So, probably caught up in nostalgia, I was very disappointed when the waffles didn't cook evenly. They were spongy not crisp even at the highest setting. The removable plates, which could be used for grilling, did not stay in place. Everytime I opened the iron, the top plate would fall out. The steel hinge holding the plates in weren't very secure. Plus, I noticed the non-stick coating chip a bit. That concerns me.Needless to say, I'm returning the item. I'm disappointed. Maybe a cheaper one will do the work!"
2,Did not function properly,"This waffle iron did not work properly. The first time we used it, the waffle cooking plan kept slipping out of the grid clips whenever we lifted the lid. My teenage daughter was doing the cooking and burnt herself trying to re-attach it. Also the waffles didn't really seem to cook through though the machine auto-shut off after several minutes."
2,I miss my G5.,"Waffles bake unevenly. Base is not stable. It's not set up to tilt into the corner fat drain (and the channels at the edges are so shallow that if they drain off more than a drop they will overflow) but it is not flat enough to safely use as a griddle, either. I cracked an egg about an inch off the middle, and it slid raw onto my table. Handles are not symmetrical. Opening and closing doesn't feel stable. If anything sticks to the top plate, it's easy to get steam burns.I had the George Foreman G5, and this doesn't have the problems it had (B&D; plates clean very easily, coating doesn't flake, no annoying spring-handles on the plates to break, exterior finish stays pretty instead of chipping and scratching), but it is inferior in every other way."
1,Non-stick coating peels off,"Upon first heating of waffle iron, non-stick coating peeled off in the center. Batter never touched waffle iron. I sent it back for a full refund. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Great for healthy freezer waffles...,"I looked all over locally, after spying this one online, to get a bigger waffle iron to supplement my letter-blocks character waffler. I waited 3 weeks through Amazon directly previously and had cancelled my order. Placed this order and it arrived within days.I use it every Saturday to make healthy whole-grain waffles for breakfast and to freeze for the school week. With 4 kids, we go through a lot of waffles and peanut butter for easy before-school breakfasts. The waffles come out fluffy and the perfect size for putting in the toaster frozen. Makes multigrain very well. I do brush veg oil on it about every 3rd time as recommended for safe measure and make sure I have enough oil in my recipe. Taking the grids out to wash is sooooo nice. I used the grill side once to make french toast and it turned out wonderfully too. I highly recommend it as a great multi-use appliance."
2,Dead in 6 months.,"According to Amazon, I bought this back in June 2011. The whole thing has gone off. It doesn't heat evenly anymore, the plates are all warped and bubbled, and the thing isn't working anymore."
1,It's in the trash and I am out $50,This is a piece of junk. Poorly constructed with the cheapest of materials. It is literally a hot plate fitted with a grill pan. I made waffles twice. They took to long and never browned correctly(never had that problem with my other waffle maker). I then decided to see if the grill part worked alright. I didn't. The cover would not close evenly on my steaks that BARELY fit in the machine. I ended up switching mid cooking to my Forman grill. I then put this on in the trash.
4,"Very good, but not perfect","I like the waffle iron. I gave it as a gift and showed my cousins how to use it. It does make good waffles, but I think the grill needs to be a little heavier to disperse the heat better. The waffles were darker in a circle aligning with the heating elements."
4,Easy to use and great for make-ahead meals.,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Him and my son go through waffles very quickly, so I thought making our own and freezing them would be more economical. It is and the waffles he makes with this iron are very good. It does take some getting use to, but once you do the cooking process is very easy."
3,Misleading,"This item is okay. The description is a bit misleading. When they say that it includes a grill plate, I am thinking of the type with ridges (like a George Foreman). But this is just a flat top (like a griddle). Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Not worth the price in my opinion."
3,Good for Waffles,"Trying to save space and time, I purchased this waffle baker to replace a much smaller one and a very nice Cuisinart Griddler for pancakes. And since I only seem to make waffles and pancakes when we have a crowd, I wanted them to come out fast and plenty. The new B&D Waffle Baker does a great job on the waffles, but used as a griddle, heats unevenly. We love the waffles and the ease of cleaning. Overall, a good choice, but not as good outside the waffle making. I guess I'l have to make space for both the B&D and the Cuisinart!"
3,could be better,"i bought this waffle iron online because I have not been able to find a ""normal"" waffle iron in stores. It is an ok waffle iron, not as good as the one I had 20 years ago...they just don't make things like they used to. It is pretty tinny.....yes, made pretty cheap. It seems to cook the waffles fine, it is better than a belguin waffle maker, I just wish when companies make a product they would have the highest priority in making a quality product."
2,Should I keep this?,I received this today - and out of the box the finish was chipped on the edge of the plate. Why can't manufacturers make a decent product - come on Black and Decker don't produce garbage that needs to returned before you can even try it.
5,Great Waffle Maker,"After looking at numerous different waffle makers, we decided on this one. The price was competitive and it is a quality maker. It also has reversable baking grids, but we have never reversed them, we just make waffles. We also purchased 1 as a gift as well."
4,As described,I have not yet had a chance to use this product but it was shipped timely and appears to be as described. It was exactly what Iwas looking for. Did not want a belgian waffle maker so this will be great.
5,Great!,"Just wanted to say that this waffle iron is great... My hubby and I have not had one in years and he got a yen for waffles. Read the reviews and sent off for it. Simple, easy, and does what it's suppose to do - make waffles. They are crisp, good size, and we have figured out the exact amount of time it takes for our ""liking"". Thanks Amazon!Don't know what we'd do without you."
2,"works well, but a pain to clean","Makes a good waffle, but the way it is built makes it hard to clean the batter that seeps under the irons."
2,Not impressed.,"I'm not impressed with this particular model. There is too much guesswork in figuring out whether or not the waffle is done or not, PLUS it's hard to get the batter into it evenly all the way to the corners. I guess I'll have to hunt for a round one."
4,"""The sun goes up and the sun goes down, I drag myself into the town, all I do I wanna do with you ...""","I was introduced to The Servant the same way everyone else was: through the trailer for ""Sin City"", in which the instrumental version of their song ""Cells"" was used. I eventually found the album (it's not easy to get in America), and listened to it.The album's greatest song is undisputedly ""Cells"". There's something about it that just makes it extremely catchy and cool. Maybe it's the guitar, or the vocals, or the heavy drums. I dunno, but it's a damn fine song. The album's other highlights are ""Orchestra"", ""Jesus Says"", and ""Liquefy"", but none light a candle to ""Cells"".This is an impressive debut album, but it's nothing spectacular (with the exception of ""Cells""). The lead singer's voice seems annoying on every song but ""Cells"". However, I think we can expect some great things from the band in the future."
2,Extremely Innacurate Scores,"This book is helpful if you just use it for instruction only, and NOT test taking. The tests are ridiculously more difficult than actual SAT's. I took a legitimate ""College Board"" test in a different book, then I studied for about 30 more hours and took a test in Gruber's book and my score decreased by more than 200 points. The tests are useless because they are not an accurate prediction of your ability on the actual SAT. Many other books give the same detailed instruction and accurate tests to go with it. Regrettably, I found this book to be a complete waste of money. Don't buy it. I recommend the Princeton Review book, the ""10 Real"", and Barron's."
3,"Too Long and boring, helpful? maybe?","This book is somewaht helpful if you were born with a number two pencil under your arm. Is too long!! If you have a lot of time to read this BIBLE, yeah it can help. But I really think that you need a teacher to go with it. My scores went up only by 10 points after reading it. So I don't think it helped me that much. yet, i will try again. I will read it once again together with other books such as 30 day to the SAT and Fast Track to the SAT & PSAT and see what results I get now. I will say it they helped me or not. Is a deal!"
4,"Pretty Good, but not fantastic","I have been studying this book for the past 2 months. Although its math section has proven to be exceptional, outlining the intricacies of the questions in detail, its verbal section is sorely lacking. Moreover, the ostensibly revolutionary critical thinking skills are no more than common sense. However, the book is supplemented with a variety of sections including a useful 3,200 word list (if you have about 4 months to learn it all)and 5 full-length practice tests. Holistically speaking, it's very good. But purchase a separate verbal book."
4,Great all in one,"Great all in one. New software available at Handango means you can carry your office (word, excel) files with you. Memory stick duo is fine, although most of the products I use are SD card, but not a deal breaker as I have multiple card usb readers at the office and at home (Lexar has a small Jumpdrive that's good). Symbian mobipocket reader reads palm ebook reader format, so it's great for ebooks in that format. So far will not read acrobat files, but they're working on it. Before I was carrying a Sony Ericsson 610 and a Palm Tungsten T. I replaced those TWO devices with this ONE."
1,Incorrect Advertising,This DVD is advertised as having closed captions but it does not. I am hearing impared and cannot understand it without closed captions so it is useless to me and the cost is not worth the hassle of trying to send it back.
3,"I love John Denver, I love the Muppets, But........","I love John Denver, I love the Muppets. I was searching for The Christmas show these two did, But you can only get the Cd. I found this and bought itIts ok, Its cute. But the songs are forgettable except the first one ""Hey old Pal"" and for those who like her I think Miss Piggy only did a cameo. Way to much of Kermits little nephewThe best suggestion I can give you is, If you have some kids about five or so, Buy it, Watch it with them, so you can visit some old friends like; John Denver and Kermit and Fozzie when they are not at their best but still good to be with."
1,Rating based on Packaging,"Rip off packaging. Show does not deserve the sub par marketing treatment. The previous seasons were so nicely done. The plastic pole which holds all the disc ""pages"" in place was already broken on arrival. Discs look plain and generic, clatter together as they are all stacked on top of each other in these flimsy disc plate holders. Disc 1 does not even stay mounted and already has a scratch. It's not like they passed on the savings to the consumer in the steep price point. Why bother? After the beautiful fun and colorful packaging they presented with the first 3 seasons... I'm glad they have not done this with 90210, which continues in season 5 with classy colorful packaging and episode notations. For collectors, the packaging is part of the joy. Contents B+, Package F."
3,Horrible Packaging!!,"Um, did i just purchase a bootleg?? On this fourth edition of Melrose Place, the manufacturers decided to ditch the nice boxes they've been using and instead switched to a cheap-looking plastic case that crams all the discs inside. I opened it up and one of the holders was already broken. The cover on the front is blurry as hell and the discs are a plain grey color. Also all the episode summaries that used to be on the back of the individual cases are now gone, all we get is the episode titles. I am extremely disapointed with this packaging but I can't wait to watch the dvds."
4,Why can't NUFAN still sound like this?,"Like others here have said, this is truly heavy in comparison to More Betterness or anything after it, hell its heavier than Leche Con Carne. If you like fast aggressive punk and if you hate NUFAN now, here's a record I highly recommend."
2,Is this really the best?,"The best of Ripley's Believe It Or Not or so the label says.Well,all I can say is if a tattooed man,followed by another tattooed man,followed by people that like to jump fences etc is the best,then I'm glad that I didn't watch most of this show's episodes. There is one shocking scene of a man that lost most of his face,but nothing remarkable otherwise.I remember the original show which was much better than this newer on. That original version had far more substance where as this show is more of the sideshow tent variety. Not worth the money."
5,Great Combination DVD,"I admit I had my doubts about ""El Mariachi"" but after watching both movies back-to-back, I liked ""El Mariachi"" better than ""Desparado."" It's like Robert Rodriguez (I'm sure I spelled his name wrong"" said in the commentary, both movies are supposed to be spoofs on 'Western Action Flicks"" and shouldn't be taken very serrioussly. Especially ""El Mariachi"" just because it's a foriegn film. Both movies are fun to watch and Roberts' commentaries and insightful and ammusing. (Don't take me serriously though, I'm not a film critic.)"
4,Pretend & Play & Learn!,"I bought this for a 5 year old I babysit for for her birthday in December. She and her 3 1/2 year old sister are having so much fun pretending to be waitresses and vendors at their snack shop. They also use their own shopping cart, purses and cash register and are learning about money values (and credit cards) that come with the set. This is a great learning tool, as well as a great imaginative toy. I love the fact that its parts store and it folds for easy and organized clean up. At about $28.00 at Amazon, it was well worth the money."
2,"Blows dust everywhere, but sands pretty well","I gave this two stars because it specifically advertises that it captures sanding dust with its ""cyclonic"" action. The only thing it does in a cyclonic action is blow dust all over your room.From a sanding perspective, it does a good job and the tip will get into tight areas."
2,Great for the 4-5 hours of use and then it stoped working,I bought this sander for some misc. work and sanding down two coffe tables so I can refinish them. As I write this I am filled with frustration as my SECOND Cyclone within the last month has now stopped turning on. The first one suffered the exact same fate. The sad part is I am only half way through my second coffe table.The unit when it works is great. I love the ability to switch between the orbital and the detail sander as I have a need for both. However both of them have died on me after 4-5 hours of use. I turned them both off to clean out the dust collectore and then they never turned back on again. I am now returning the second Cyclone back to the store where I bought it and buying a Dewalt. I know personally I look to amazons reviews for tools quite often so I thought id just share my frustration in hoops that I help someone else avoid my situation.
1,UNEVEN and UNCOMFORTABLE,"If you like a bed that pushes your body into the center with raised edges, than this is the bed for you. A bed should be flat. This bed was designed by someone who never even tried to lie down in it. The design is totally flawed. My biggest fears were buying an air bed that leaked, not one that puts strain on your body because it is not flat. Horrible design. F. Waste of money."
2,Not as great as advertised,"We've only had this bed less than a month and it leaks, and each time we blow it up, it swells up a bit more, in other words, it don't hold its original shape."
1,HUUUUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Very, very disappointing, not usable unless I can figure a way around the ""fall toward the middle"" issue. Directions are clear and mattress is easy to inflate; however when you sit or lay on it, you immediately roll toward the middle of the mattress. In my situation this was to be used as a temp/guest sleep solution, but no way two people can sleep on the mattress. If one gets up, it's like being at the top of a seesaw and having the person on the bottom get off and drop you. Even one night on it alone was a bad night; if you turn from your side onto your back in your sleep, you'll just keep rolling. I've tried manipulating the air in upper/lower chambers, only makes it worse. The line in the ad about ""flex coil construction for sleeping in stable and firm positions"" is a bunch of baloney. Don't waste your money!!"
4,Very durable !!!,This bed is amazing!!! My family came for the holidays and I bought this bed!! It was used from december 7 till march 12 and I just have to bump air twice. I had my siter with her 2 kids sleeping on it and the kids used to jumping on it and still it didnt leak. Then I had my parents using it and for them I just had to pump air once. It is not to confortable at first but with one week sleeping on it you get used to it.
4,Our extra guest bed,"We bought this bed to handle an over flow of guests. We decided to try it out before subjecting our guests. Not bad! My only complaints are it's cold ( we were forewarned by other reviews)and it's very hard to make up. In fact it's impossible to make up! I tried sheets but they don't fit well and you can't tuck them in. I used an open sleeping bag - ok - just not very beautiful. If, you are looking for a bed for extra guests - this is a great answer. The bed is very comfortable and easy to inflate and deflate. Just don't think this bed will make up as a beautiful guest room."
5,This air mattress kicks some serious ass.,"I'm tired of the flimsy, leaky, 1-year lifetime mattresses. I was looking for something that felt like it would last me a lifetime -- the way durable goods should last. With his Insta-bed, I really feel I've found it. Will update if anything goes wrong after a year, but I seriously doubt it. It inflates faster than anything I have seen before, and it does not leak. You will wake up just as you went to bed. In my case, I have to say that I've had to ""re-inflate"" after 2 or 3 nights in a row but its will probably be rare that I use this more than 2 or 3 nights in a row in the future. The material feels like it would be the mattress that the US army would have picked for its soldiers. Its durable and strong, yet the top is nice and soft. If I could change anything I would make it slightly less tall so it would not be gigantic. but it is nice to sleep on the taller mattress and not feel like you are on the floor. Overall, I've never been happier with an air bed."
1,Worst Sleep Ever,"Sorry to say.... This mattress was very painful to sleep on. You and your partner tend to roll to the middle so you have to over inflate to prevent that. The outcome is a way too hard bed that causes aches and pains all night long. I am considering returning the mattress, if that is possible."
4,Good bed,Cant beat the price for what you get. Had to fill it up one more time after the first night but that's because the plastic stretches after you have put your weight on it.
2,Had to return,I was psyched at getting this. Pump worked great. The issue was there was a hole in the crease at the top where it could not be mended. Had to return and will probably go with a simpler setup.
1,this product is horrible!!!!!!,This bed is the worst air bed I have ever owned I bought it because of all the reviews it had and that some people were using it on a daily basis. I have only had this bed for two months and the one of the seems burts in the middle of the night as I was sleeping. After speending the whole next day fixing and patching the one seem the very next day after that another seem burst as I was laynig down to sleep. this is crazy I spent $120 on a bed for it it barly last 2 months now im left sleeping on the floor because I am unable to afford buying a new bed. I will never buy this product ecer again. Amazons policy is you can only return something after 30 days to me is unfair because this bed is so new and gently used. I can understand if I abused this bed but that is simply just not the case I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT AND I HOPE OTHER DO NOT BUY THIS AND BE JUST AS UNSATISFIED AS I AM...
2,Deflating doesn't work so good,"First the good news; the price was right, it inflated with no problems, held air (so far), and is comfortable to sleep on.Now the bad news; the ""auto deflate"" feature doesn't work as advertised. The electric pump sucks out the air from the bottom of the mattress, but then the plastic material collapses around the pump so that it no longer can pull air from the pillow top section. Ultimately it overheats the pump and you have to turn it off for 30 minutes to let the motor cool down. In order to get the rest of the air out, I had to have one person wrestle with the built-in pump and the collapsed material around it so it wouldn't clog the inside of the airway, while I laid on the mattress to help force air out. It would have been much simpler if this mattress had a manual release valve to allow air out. With the pump as the only method of pulling air out, this is a PAIN.The price made this an appealing purchase, but I wouldn't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again."
5,As Promised,"We took it along to visit our son in his small apartment. Used it four nights. It inflates easily, holds air well and (maybe best of all) deflates quickly and completely."
2,Didn't last,"I bought this bed on August 11 of last year. Today, August 10, 2012, I came home and found a huge bulge in the middle.This is the great curse of air mattresses: the internal baffles detach from the surface, rendering the bed unuseable. I've been sleeping on air mattresses for 15-17 years now, and this has happened with every one. Why can't they figure out how make the baffles stay attached? We just landed a space vehicle on Mars, why can't we make an air mattress that lasts for more than a year or two? I'm giving this product two stars, because it was pretty comfortable, while it lasted. But I think a product like this should last at least four or five years."
5,very pleased...,purchased this item for out of town company. easy to get set up. very comfortable. would recommend to anyone needing extra bedroom space.
3,worst waterbed ever,"Greetings fellow amazonians I purchased this because my old waterbed sprung a leak, don't ask for more details other than it involved a pair of scissors and the dog-faced girl. Anyhoo when this mattress arrived I was suprised not to find an easy female connector to hook my hose to, so I went to home depot with the mattress to find a connector. After twohours of searching I finally found to connectors that when daisy chained together had the fit I needed. Fill up was ok but when I was done this mattress didn't feel right. It was lumpy and didn't have the nice sway that most other waterbeds have. I may return I will keep you posted."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE- terrible return policy!!!,"This product is a giant ecological waste! I bought it after reading the glowing reviews- Our bed did not inflate AT ALL!!!ANd then since I was having visitors, we borrowed another one from a friend. By chance it was the exact same model. This one did quickly inflate but an hour later it was half flat.To my horror, when I talked to the manufacturer- I was instructed to CUT out the label- as proof it does not work- because they did not want it back!!! AND then thinking I would be refunded I was stunned when I got a response from them saying they would only send another or upgrade it. The upgrade version got 2 stars!!! I am now in a mess with Amazon trying to get my money. I feel totally guilty about the giant heap of plastic trash I have created! THIS PRODUCT IS A DISASTER!!I am back to an old mattress for guests- and am fine with it!!!"
2,"Good for one person, bad for two","This bed is very good for one person. For two people, it's a disaster. The sides are so high, that you both roll toward the middle. Forget this bed for two people."
1,Not worth the price,The second time I used this air mattress there was a small rip in the side. The outer shell was flat within 5 minutes. I used the patch kit to repair the rip and the next night it was flat again. This occurred outside of my return window so I am not able to recover any of my money I spent.Durability of this air mattress is terrible. I would recommend looking at different models.
2,Just Alright,"The bed wasn't that comfortable especially for two people. After two nights, I decided to sleep on a coach, which was more comfortable to me. It doesn't seem to inflate as firmly as it should."
4,Insta-bed serves purpose,The insta-bed meet all my expectations and performed as advertised. It inflated quickly and was comfortable to sleep on. It also deflated completely and packed back into the storage bag provided.
3,Smelley but good,I agree with another reviewer that stated that this mattress is smelly. The plastic smell was so overwhelming for me that I had to return it. I was sorry that I had to return this mattress as it seems to be of good quality. I now have an Intex air mattress and since I prefer a firm mattress I find that I need to add more air every 4 days. The Wenzel promises no air leaks so I am sure that it is a better mattress.
2,Not so great,Bought this Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with built-in Pump. Not a happy camper. My wife and I tried to sleep on it. Both of us keep rolling to the center and it looses air each night. I think I would have better off buying two twin beds and pushing them together.
2,OK,My husband and I felt this air mattress was not comfortable for 2 people as we both ended up rolling to the middle of the mattress. We also had to replace the air often during usage.I did like the quick inflation process.
2,I wouldnt reccomend it,"This air mattress sucks. The air comes out quick, every half hour you have to air it up. Its not worth 117 in a nut shell."
5,worked as described,We ordered the bed to use for company. It arrived on time and worked as described on your( Amazon) web site. It inflated and stayed inflated for the five days it was used. No loss of air. It was easy to make/queen sheets fit it well. I did read that it might be cool on the bottom so we added a blanket on the bottom to keep company cozy. Our company found the bed to be very comfortable. Deflating the bed was just as easy. The only thing we need to practice now is folding it so that it fits the storage/carrying bag. Right now it's too big to fit the bag!!
5,One of the Good ones,"Wow, were my wife and I surprised when we got our Insta-Bed. We blew it up and found it to be worth the money. Sound construction, blew up quickly, and folded back up when deflated. We used it on a get away weekend, and had our son and daughter in law spend the night on it. Well needless to say they loved it. The sheets stay on the bed, the bed didn't move. It held up great. Money well spent."
1,Not worth it.,The wife and I relocated to New Mexico and couldn't afford to bring our furniture with us. I saw great reviews on this air bed and ordered it. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!! It loses air every night and we have to re-inflate it. It came with a pinprick hole in the right side and I used the two patches included...had to cover those with duct tape. Go to Wal-Mart or Target and try the one made by Coleman. This isn't worth it.
2,Doesn't hold air,"I was very excited to get this bed because of all the great reviews. I got it for my mother in law so she could have a nice bed while she visited for the holidays. And while it looked nice and the pump seemed to work well, we discovered my mother in law nearly on the floor in the morning. She said she didn't feel it losing air, but every morning she woke up, the mattress had lost nearly half of its air.We continued to inflate it to its maximum level, and never discovered any leaks...we were ultimately discouraged and had to send it back. Maybe it was just a lemon, but it didn't hold up under weight of an average to smaller sized woman."
2,Not sure what is wrong with this bed,"I reviewed many different air beds, trying to find a really good one for my son who is off to college; he wanted to have an extra for us and guests when we come visit; based on having a built in pump and the many good reviews I purchased this bed; I am so disappointed. No matter how much air you put into the bed, in a few hours you sink into the middle. We have all tried sleeping on it. We are not in the least heavy people, and my 18 year old is quite thin. Down we go into the middle, sinking like a rock. This is not going to be fun when we go to visit. I am very disappointed with this product. I wish I had bought a cheaper queen size version of the twin Simmons I have. I did not return it due to the inconvenience of trying to pack this monstrosity back into its box and paying for shipping back. I really regret my purchase though."
1,Mattress was shipped with a burnt out pump,"I was really anticipating trying out this mattress from all the positive reviews online. When I received the package it looked legit. I opened it up and plugged it in, all I hear is a loud humming noise. No air going in, so I turn it to deflateMode and same noise happens and no air is being sucked out. I'm really disappointed that this air mattress failed me. I needed one by this week so I guess I will be sleeping on the floor now. Another thing is I don't know how this product is a Wenzel? It does not say anything about that brand on the box, on the mattress, or even on the pump? It just says I insta-bed all over it. I am going to try exchanging this product to give them another shot. I will update my review to let everyone know how it goes."
1,Not insta air bed,"I awoke in the morning with my feet up high & my head flat on the floor. It left me with such a strained neck, that I eventually needed physical therapy. I AM keeping the 'bed' for a particular cousin I can't stand, but insists on just ""dropping in"" on me without any notice. I'm due for another visit soon, I'll ramp this little baby up & giggle when I go to bed. It'll be priceless to see her face in the am!In fact, I'd suggest this little gift for any household wanting to cut down on unwanted overnight visitors. It's a winner!"
3,"Quality product, but flawed design","My complaint with this mattress is that the sides are way too high. It would be fine for one person, but my brother and sister in law couldn't both sleep comfortably on this mattress at the same time. They kept being rolled toward the center!"
4,Can't Complain,My husband and I really needed an air mattress that would last at least a month with daily use (in the middle to moving to Germany). I have lower back and hip problems and I can say that I can sleep soundly on it. The built in pump is great. We have to fill it up a little every day before we use it and it makes small popping sounds when getting off of it; but other than that it is great. We have been using it for about two weeks and have not had any leaks! It looks like it will go the distance.
1,saralex,"Very disappointed with this mattress. The sheets have no where to grip around thesides and end up bunching up. On the top of the mattress, there is a 7"" band aroundthe edge and this is higher than the rest of the top. This makes it seem like you sink in the center. Much better beds on market."
4,Nice bed for guests,We inflated the bed the day we received it to make sure it was going to hold air and give it a chance to get rid of the new smell. It took about 4 minutes to inflate and the new smell was gone after 12 hours. We used the bed for 7 nights and were pleased with the comfort. We weigh over 400 pounds and the bed provided adequate support and was comfortable. We added a small amount of air twice during the 7 days because we prefer a very firm mattress. We would have rated the bed 5 stars if the mattress pad had something better to hold on to. Overall we are pleased with our purchase and recommend this bed to anyone that needs a temporary bed for guests.
2,NOT a Review,"I agree with the previous writer. This is NOT a review, but a complaint. I too waited almost 2 months for the thing - Now if you don't have it, you can't ship it - BUT I cancelled my Amazon order and ordered it from Rockler - Got it in 3 days. Jet - get with it and supply your venders. Amazon - if you can't get it, take it out of your catalog."
4,welcome addition to my mini lathe,"First off, the extension bed is great. From time of delivery to time of putting the bed extension to use was about 30 minutes. Took a little tweeking to get the two pieces aligned but went relatively smooth. Second issue, the packaging for transit sucks. Inside the box they designed the padding poorly (expanded styrofoam). One end had a large block of foam surrounding it the other had little padding at all and in turn one of the plastic foot pads was broken. I was able to make the repair in short order but this should never have happened. A full block of foam padding at both ends would have prevented this."
3,Decent product.,Works good but the casing cracked on the first spark plug I installed it on. Still a very good concept.
2,"Good idea, bad result","This was a good idea, but the result leaves much to be desired. This is clearly a home-made effort and it suffers for it."
4,"Great sharpness, balance, and appearance","We just received these knives as a wedding gift, and we've been very happy with them so far. The knives are extremely sharp, easily slicing through even fatty partially frozen meat. They feel very comfortable in your hand, and although the saleswoman had warned us that some people dislike the fact that the blade does not go straight into the handle (there is sort of a upside-down V shaped gap), we haven't found this to be a problem. The instructions specified to wash the knives by hand, which is quick and easy to do since they wipe off easily. The knives looks great as well, although, as other reviewers have mentioned, the is an extra slot in the block, and some of the knives don't fit entirely snugly. As far as performance goes, however, I would definitely recommend this knife set."
3,Devil is in the details,"I say this one when it first came out and a few details always lingered in my mind. For 1941, this was quite a production. Boris was at the height of his powers and the story line was good. It has many of the features of the early Frankenstein films including the angry mob, the demented side-kick and the mildly deranged scientist. Someone ought to remake this with some of our current 'stars' playing the dead bodies inside the space suits."
3,ALL SERIOUS GAMERS,I am a 23 year old army veteran living in Saint Louis MO looking for a 3 person or more team to battle. Since I got back from Iraq and got out of the army 3 months ago I have been looking for a good team to battle. My 3 teammates and I are only interested in SERIOUS gamers that want to battle for real. NO KIDS!!! 18 and older please. We can battle for money or just bragging rights. We only battle in the woods 2 or 3 square mile radious boundry. ALL airsoft weapons allowed. Both team captains agree on the terms and no refs. This is real battle and we treat it as such!!!
2,drags on,"As an avid fan of Noel Streatfield, I was eager to enjoy this book! The story begins after the war, rationing is a problem, and a girl recieves a gift from America- a party dress and shoes! As no parties seem likely, the children decide to give a pageant so she can narrate in her new outfit. The entire community becomes involved in the project. This book just drags on with endless descriptions of rehearsals. This one was just not worth the tiome."
4,Gusty and innovative...draws you in,"The beauty of this book is that it is written in second person. Another reviewer (whose name I would give if I remembered it...not trying to take credit) stated that as it was written, you became too close to the problems of the character to see the severity of them, wherein lies the genius. How many of us know to what level our problems have arisen without an objective outside party? People always embellish or play down their no-no's, depending on who they are. I think the author took this human flaw and ran with it, making a painfully realistic and potently moving novel. Watching the character's fall to rock bottom and then rebirth at the end was absolutely engrossing, and the black humor of it was well appreciated."
1,"bright lights, big ego","Self-satisfied, smug, condescending, homophobic, misogynist pap. And not very well-written, either."
4,Whens it time to pay the bill??,"This is an awesome little book! If you ever were new in a big city when young, you probably knew a Tad Allagash.Or waking up, feeling like dogmeat, after a night of partying hard, trying to avoid the dawning sunlight, walking past a milk company, knowing a full workday was ahead. Been there, done that.The best revenge is living well......"
4,Why didn't release all Lemon Popsicle movies???,"I'm a huge fan of these movies,.. but in the US only sales Going Steady (aka Lemon Popsicle 2).. it's truth that this series is not more popular these days but it's a classic.. it's the first bunch of movies about teenage sex or love... Before Porkys, American Pie or Revenge of the Nerds series.. I hope one day I can buy Lemon Popsicle 1,2,3,4,5.. the remain movies sucks"
1,"""Would You Like Some Stewed Prunes?""","""Going Steady"" is a coming of age movie made in Israel and dubbed (badly) from the original Hebrew. Set in the 1950's, the movie is made to nauseate. From the ultra-squeaky dubbed female voices, to the horrid caricature of a Jewish mother, to the subplots about fish and ice in a bathtub, and a fixation about stewed prunes, this really is the Yiddish ""Porky's,"" and that's terribly unfortunate.The film is like a sharp poke in the eye: the script, acting, and especially music are ultimately annoying. The level of humor is extremely juvenile (throwing eggs at a budding violinist, loads of sexual innuendo, etc.), and seeks to prove, among other things, that stalking is fun.The actress playing the female lead, Tammy (Yvonne Michaels), is modestly talented and pretty, all other participants are homely hacks. I found this film utterly repulsive. You have been warned."
5,Great Book,A wonderful resource for anyone interested in having a bunny as a pet. It has become my first go-to for any questions related to bunny care.
2,what i thought,i thought the movie was ok but that is just my thoughts. it was not that interesting to me. that is why i have nothing to say about it
1,Mini-lathe stand,I wish I could review this product. I ordered it over thirty days ago and it still has not arrived at my door.
4,"Potter's Tool Kit Has All The Essential Tools For Cleaning, Trimming And Shaping Your Pottery Creation","It arrived prompt but I was looking for a specific brand and somehow there was a bait and switch, I don't know that it was the vender, maybe just a glitch with Amazon. I was looking for a specific brand and then when I got the thing it was NOT what I expected, but a cheaper knock off brand. I kept it because I had to use it the next day. Seller was prompt in delivery."
4,X-cellent beat throughout the cd!!,"I love this CD, it's excellent party music, I always play this cd at partys along with HI-voltage bass"
3,Disappointing video quality,"This was a great show I used to love watching back in the 90's. I am however a little upset with the video quality of this set. The backgrounds are fine but all the characters and moving animations in the front blur and then sharpen every second over and over and that blurriness and fuzziness to sharpness for a second and back gets really annoying. It makes it look like they ripped off AVI's and put them on here with crappy quality. Other than that major annoyance, its great to be able to see the show again.I give it a 3 because of the bad video transfer."
3,I don't agree,"Flannery O'Connnor is a great writer and her talens is obvious. But I just do not agree with the choice she presents, vacuous pleasure seeking or suffering for your soul. I think there are other ways of being, quite honestly. So I caoot rate this as a great book when it seems to offer such an empty world with two pretty depressing choices."
1,Utterly confusing,"This book was chosen for my monthly book club and out of 10 women, not a single one of us enjoyed reading it. Most of us were confused by the story because a lot of it didn't even make sense. There was no real flow to the story and it was a struggle just to make it to the end. The characters were all pretty nasty people and the book definitely is not one to read if you want to be put in a good mood. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"Good when sitting up, difficult to sleep in","I like this mask for meditation, which I do sitting up in a chair. It's very cleverly designed and you really can easily open your eyes while wearing it, and yet be in complete darkness. Very cool.However, it's pretty much useless for sleeping, unless you sleep sitting up or you always and only lie on your back. The front of the mask is a flexible but thick black plastic, and the edges are not comfortable in any position other than ""upright"".So, if you want an excellent mask for meditation, positive visualisation, light sensitivity relief, or similar, and you don't intend to lie down on your side at all (i.e. lie only on your back or sit up), this is a very worthwhile product. Otherwise, don't bother, because you're not likely to be able to sleep in it comfortably."
5,This bird soars!,"Peters weaves a darn good tale. While it ends in the usual Peters's fashion with the love-birds off to a good start to a bright future, she constructs one of the most suprisingly vicious villians of the chronicles. She adeptly juggles a complex plot line and insighful characterizations."
2,"Somewhat predictable, and a little over the top","The book sounded interesting when reading a synopsis, but after reading it was not as good as it could have been. It was an interesting read due to the fact that it was done in the first person, but that is about all I can say.The main character is definitely twisted, in his logic and everything else. To think that he could be that quick on his feet with his thinking, especially when he has been drinking etc, brings it down. Definitely not the worst book that I have read (thus 2 stars and not one), but not all that great either. Hopefully he can do better with his next novel. There is potential, but it was not fulfilled here."
3,NO effect on my skin,I didn't see any effect on my skin I have a horrible acne and I saw in the internet to drink some Vitamins A and E for my skin but I dink this thing every day with Vitamin A and C but I didn't see any result. If you guys want your acne to be gone you guys should take a Phantotenic acid (Vitamins B5) because that is the only product in world made my acne gone.
3,Wrong size,"Even after using the in-site tool to order the correct part, this one that arrived did not fit my vehicle. I think it is an OK product if it fit."
4,Stand Fast,Mary Dresser's STAND FAST is a skillful researched blend of historical fact and earthy fiction. The story covers events from the Scot's Rebellion of 1746 to Washington's victory at Yorktown in 1781.
3,Works and fits,"I need the belt, it fits and works. I am happy. Will get again when i need another one, also its cheaper then walmart"
5,Eureka 61120D-12 Yype U Vacuum Cleaner Belt,The Eureka Belt as in title works as I had hoped. It holds up to the paces I put it through.
3,Mixed feelings,"You see, I don't have problem in particular with the belt. I have a problem with the vacuum it is used for, that namely the weakest point in the system is this forsaken belt that I am now doomed to buy until I feel like buying a new vacuum. Seriously the belt breaks every third time I use it. I would like to review the product engineer."
3,Okay,"If you are already familiar with this wonderful breed, I do not think the book add any valuable information."
5,Best Book!,This was one of the best books I have ever read! Even though it was a little old it was great. I think I liked it even more because it was true and I had been to the places described and could follow it on the map. This was a great book that I would read over again and again!
2,Not so rich Music,"I started hearing the disc 1. I got a little head ache,by the time when I was hearing the 9th song.The music is not rich as the ""Eastern energy"". Too much usage of the minute shivering music ( nn ga nn ga nnga nnga nnga ) is a bit boring. This music is like a filler between the major tunes.The tunes doesn't penetrate and are easy going.It islike a mix of child patterns as he plays the key board.Except for the first song <Freedom>,which is already available in the eastern enery others don't inspire anything.If you want to try the 12 girls band,Go for eastern energy. This is not the best choice to try.I am yet to listen <Disc 2>. I will soon comeback with the review comments on that."
2,"Intrigues, then insults you in the end.","From the film's description, I was expecting a disturbing bloodbath - thankfully, it wasn't. The autumnal scenery combined with the interesting soundtrack are riveting, the story with its covert psychological implications draws you in - then, unfortunately, we are left with a totally non-believable ending that insults the rest of the film as well as the viewer. I just think I would have ended it differently."
3,So-so,"I guess I'm more into music like Joe Dassin and Michel Sardou. This CD is a bit too pop/electronica for me. Her voice is beautiful, I did like a couple of the songs, and it's French -- if you like the style of music, you'll definitely like this.For some more mellow French music, I just found a CD,D'Apparence en Apparence, by Louis, which I really enjoyed."
5,Take a Gamble and read Queen's Gambit,"An excellent addition to the authors resume. The one who brought us The Hustler and the Color of Money - Walter Tevis takes us on another pyschological thrill. We meet the heroine, a young lady who finds she has a gift. She can play chess and play it very well. Tevis takes us inside this prodigy's troubled and brillant mind as she finds what she is truly about. As a chessplayer... it offered me a great insight to my own thinking. I highly recommend to anyone though... like Searching for Bobby Fischer you don't need to be a chess player to enjoy or understand it... It may be better if you aren't."
3,The Weakest Season of a Great Series,"Despite the harsh title, relatively speaking, Six Feet Under's weakest season eclipses many lesser television show's ""greatest"" efforts. But with that said, I found the character development in this season ranging from stagnant to contrived. Furthermore, the plot was very heavy-handed, delving into the melodramatic at times. But despite these complaints, I still enjoyed this offering and appreciated its efforts."
5,Six feet under season 4,I bought this for myself and I love the quality of the dvd came on time i will highly reccomended
5,"Quirky, dark and deep","All the actors in this series seem to be truly living the parts, not acting. I appreciated the depiction of flawed but sincere relationships."
1,"Hopefully, this will be a good DVD","Operative word is ""HOPE"" as I doubt they will release Bruce Lee's films in 5.1 or clean up the picture, even though it is good on other Regions. Let's just hope this DVD has a better picture cleared of all defects, Dolby Digital 5.1, the FULL movie, and some extras. Bruce Lee deserves a hell of a lot more than he gets with these cheap Region 1 DVDs."
3,"bruce lee lives on,on dvd",I give the over all movie a 3 star because of the acting. But I give the movie a 5 star on the fight scenes. Bruce Lee is the MAN when it comes down to the action.
3,An Okay Collection,"I picked this DVD up when it was a brand-new release. It contains the following episdoes:Dora the Explorer: ""Little Star"" - A great episode!Blue's Clues: ""Tickety's Favorite Nursery Rhyme"" - Pretty good episode.Wonder Pets: ""Save the Three Little Pigs/Save the Owl"" - Excellent Episodes!Jack's Big Music Show: ""The Music Monster"" - I had never seen any episodes of this show before. I personally think it lacks any educational value and find it a bit strange honestly. Not my favorite.Yo Gabba Gabba: ""Sleep"" - Another show I'd never seen before. I find it really weird and pretty pointless. Not to mention the characters remind me too much of the Teletubbies.Blue's Room: ""Sprinkle's Sleepover."" - A great episode!My daughter (2 years old) and I enjoy 4 of the 6 episodes. So it's not bad. I'm not sure I'd buy another Nick Jr. collection though."
3,Panasonic RP-WF6000,"The Panasonic RP-WF6000 are nice headphones in general, good fit but a bit heavy. The battery life isn't so good as you need to recharge after every 6-8 hours of use + aren't the best if you decide to use them for music but generally they are good headphones."
2,Awful music.,"I watched this film for the simple reason that I am a great fan of Glenn Ford and Donald Pleasence, I wouldn't have bothered otherwise. The film is watchable, in an average sort of way, but what struck me most about it was the terrible music. Music can make or break a movie, and it certainly doesn't add anything to this one. I can only describe it as being the kind of organ music that is used to accompany silent movies. I would venture to suggest that this movie, with music more appropriate to a war film, would have attracted more stars from all of the reviewers, myself included."
3,Handy little compass,"I bought this to pin to the strap of my backpack while hiking. It's very convenient since you don't need to hold it level for it to work. It has a very heavy duty safety pin unlike another cheaper same style compass I bought. I lost that one on the first outing. the only concern I have is that I bought 2 of these (one for my girlfriend also), and there is a noticable difference between the two as to where they indicate North. For simple naviation this shouldn't be an issue. If you buy one, check it against a known accurate compass before you NEED it."
4,Superb collection !!!!,"Sound quality very good - not scratchy. Disc 1 has many great hit songs, disc 2 Extraordinary.Superb collection !!!!"
3,Pretty good movie for a first time director,"Head Of State is a pretty funny movie from the not always funny Chris Rock. With history possibly getting ready to be made in Novemeber this film is a true testament of what goes on in poltics. With his directoral debut, Rock made an enjoyable fim.The ad campagins that Rock does towards his opponent had me in tears. Then when Berine Mac comes into the movie he steals it with every scene he's in. If you want a funny film then check this one out."
3,Not Bad But I've Seen Better,"I personally wasn't offended by most of Rock's jokes but overall the film wasn't that great though it had its moments (such as the debate near the end of the film). Still, I have to agree Chris Rock is funnier when he's doing stand up comedy. His films just don't seem as funny as his comedy routines. Plus, for those that view ""adult"" films, was it just me or was that former adult film star Monique sitting in the crowd during Rock's character's initial speech when he decided to go his own way and deviate from the script?Overall, not bad but I'd find it at a reduced price or just rend it."
3,ok. but could have been better.,"Chris Rock' plays Mays Gilliam a low rung on the political ladder who is ""chosen"" to run by party leaders as a wild card and not expected to win.The movie is about his campaign for the presidency which gives Chris Rock a podium forhis thoughts on politics.... well abit... he could have used this device for his comedy but I didnt think it was that funny.... I didnt expect to be taking notes on political theory going into the movie, just some laughs but this movie was par for the course for Rock if not abit below.... Concept was there just not the excecution...Bernie Mac was hilarious tho.... a good rental, not a purchase...."
5,Kids Loved It!!!,The kids had fun and got a workout at the same time! Highly recommend to anyone with children age 12 and under.
4,Great Work Out!!,"This is a great video that gets you and your kids moving. It's fun, and easy to do. Shaun T is good at explaining each new move and walks you through it. I highly recommend it for your family!!!"
2,its okay,its a good workout buy my boys are 7 and 11 and they just weren't interested. The guys talks and acts kind of silly which makes it worst. we did it once together and thats it.
5,Wonderful Reading,"Thomsen teaches you a great deal about what living in a poor, rural, South American town is like. You can actually feel his sadness, elation and frustration gripping hold of you from the pages. I would recomend this to anyone, even if you are not interested in the Peace Corps. It was an extremely enjoyable read."
4,Good Book,It's a good book. What can I say? I wish the font was a little bigger. It was still worth the purchase though.
2,Not the scope described,The scope description says repeatedly that it has the BDC reticle. I received the scope and it had a Nikoplex reticle. VERY disappointing.
1,Bored me to tears,"I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews but it was just plain boring! If you like the English society scene of going from ball room to ball room AND entertainment to entertainment AND insipid conversations AND women being taught how to pimp themselves out then you will love this book. I hated it! Morgana and Sloane continually felt themselves pulled together, but constantly pulled away from each other over and over again, it was tiresome. I didn't care what happened to either one of them, if they got together or not!"
2,Was not impressed,"I read about 1/2 of this book and put it down (which is something that I rarely do). This book has some good, hard-to-find teachings, specifically regarding sun gazing. However, I am just not attracted to glorification and praise - two things that the author spends a lot of time doing. This book has a lot of feel-good fluff and lacks the deep wisdom that I enjoy.The one insight that stands out the most from this book is: what you look at (focus on) you become. So turn off the TV, toss out the music, eliminate all sources off discontent, misery, violence, etc. And focus on the most loving, most magnificient, most powerful source of love and life that we as humans know... THE SUN!To learn more on sun gazing - look up Hira Ratan Manek."
