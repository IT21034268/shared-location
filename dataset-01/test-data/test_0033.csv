2,Not reliable,I am very disappointed in this squirrel cage it is not consistent. You will catch one squirrel and then for 10-12 other times the squirrel gets the food and the cage does not close properly. or find it closed and the food still there. Havahart 1025 Two-Door 18 x 5 x 5-Inch Cage Trap for Squirrels
3,Don't believe the free packets part,After ordering twice online I have yet to see my 4 free packets. Met-Rx does not sell there items in boxes of 16 packets so one would assume a box of 20 plus 4 free would show up. This is not the case so please expect to see only 20 packets show up!!!
2,Great Taste-PissPoor (No) Customer Service,"I have used Met-Rx before and I like it alot. It has a lot of protein. I got the vanilla and have also tried the chocolate. My only gripe is this company has ""NO CUSTOMER SERVICE"" and is un-responsive to email queries about their products from their website. So In my opinion, if they do not care about their customers, then I don't buy their product again. I would recommed not buying this product, if you need assistance with it. If not, then go right a head."
2,Too hard to get dolls in!,"I usually rely heavily on the Amazon reviews before making toy purchases. This time, however I did not listen and should have. I read the reviews about how hard it was to get dolls in and out and said to myself ""How Hard can it be?"" Well, Its nearly impossible!! My hands were twisted in so many different directions I couldnt beleive they actually put this out on the market. I bought this for my 3 year old son because he loves dolls and dollhouses. I will say that despite him having to call me every time he wants to change seating arrangements, he still does enjoy the car once everyone is in. (Sometimes its 20 minutes before I can get everyone in). My advice is to get a convertible or something else and pass on this one. (Unless you like whining and scratched up hands)"
2,odd- the dolls don't fit,"This vehicle is attractive for children who have Happy Family or any Barbie items, however the dolls DON""T fit. Except for the babies you can't get the Dad all the way in."
1,THIS MOVIE IS S H I T,"I caught this trash on Showtime 2 the other night. It's complete and utter trash. Humour is bland, story is lame and performances are non existant. If you are latino you'll never buy this is a real family. It's stereotyped, insulting and Thalia demonstrates, once again, what a BAD actress she is"
1,"Even if you don't pay, you'll still want your money back","Basic technique for filtering out lousy movies: The cast contains 2 or 3 people you almost always enjoy, stars 1 person you've never even seen in a movie but heard of from another entertaintment field, and you've never heard of the movie before. According to imdb.com, this 3-year-old stinker put an end to Thalia's movie carreer, and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. A rambling script and misguided direction (both on the part of the same person) waste the talents of Paul Rodriguez and Danny Aiello (who barely appears). The other performances look more like half-baked read throughs. The fact that the opening sequence is supposed to take place in New York City at Christmastime, but people are running around in short sleeves should tip you off right away. Don't even think about taking a chance on this one."
5,I looove Escaflowne,"Escaflowne is a wonderful anime which I think all anime fans would like. it has a very intricate plot thats makes you want to see more. The only down side to this anime is if you miss one episode you can miss a lot, unlike sailor moon or Pokemon."
5,A GEM,"Jeff just plays, and plays it well. Unlike many rock/pop albums, this just improves over time, the true test of good music. As others have pointed out, the subtleties are myriad, creating a new and fresh listening experience each time this is played. And congratulations to George Martin, a lesser producer could not have created such a deft touch to bring out all the subtleties."
4,Studio vs. Live,"Blow by Blow - The CD is what I remember from the past, which is what I was wanting.After listening to the CD, I realized that I used to LOVE the LIVE version of some of these tunes... and so, I bought the Jeff Beck/Jan Hammer LIVE CD.Blow by Blow is a studio recording which I find a little ""dry"" when compared to the energy of the LIVE CD... But it's still Jeff Beck!"
5,It is awesome and so are the Carpenters,The Carpenters were a wonderful duo their music is timeless and so are they. Karen had a awesome voice and a beautiful woman. she is greatly missed to her fans. I recommend this video highly to everyone.
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband picked this out and I bought it for his birthday last week. I gave it to him Saturday and it was broke by Wednesday (last night). He was using it in our back yard when the ball went flying off. It came with a replacement ball, so initially he thought it could be fixed. However the 2nd ball doesn't stay on, so we are thinking some other piece probably flew off as well, leaving us with a piece of junk.Luckily we purchased through SG and can get a refund (I'm told). He was so excited to use this thing, and loved it the first few days. Such a disappointment...hopefully this can save you from going through the same thing."
1,Broke the first time I used it,"The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image. She called them and they said the would replace the ball. They never did.I have not found a place to order replacement parts."
2,Nancy was a slut in this book!!,"OK, the mystery was good, but I HATED how she was with Sasha Petrov. He really bugged me. Then Ned(GO NED!! GO NED!!) comes to visit and has to win nancy back and that is VERY tiring and it gets old.Mystery: goodSasha: BAD!!"
4,SPEED KILLS!,"Can be watched as a black comedy cult film, or as a warning about the dangers of drug addiction. Some of my friends are already addicted to drugs, and when I saw this movie I thought of them, and what they do to get the money they need for drugs. Creepy!"
1,A book out of the blue,"This seemed totally disjointed as I read it. Snippets of the author's childhood, reference to her father's drinking problems, some small indication of her bipolar diagnosis, but mostly a reverie of her successful career in television. There was nothing here that was particularly striking or unique in any way. None of the issues were well developed enough to satisfy my appetite for detail. I was disappointed with it."
3,A bit scattered!,I had a difficult time following the story. A few points were on target but the whole context was not what I was expecting.
3,Not much on Bi-polar,I found it to be a good book but not much was said about Jane having Bi Polar and it effecting her life and family.
1,Stereo type latino,"This is a streo type latino film.About cars and latinos with accents,and having no class.We all seen this before,even though the lead character seems to hav some good qualities.Apollonia which name is in front of the box is only in the movie for one minute,what a waste of money for Prince fans,this film is overly price.The film wa done in ealy 80's,since than we have seen better films with latinos."
4,house-husband or hermit?,"I highly recommend this book. It was written by the man who worked as Lennon's assistant for the last two years of John's life. He tells of John's seclusion in the Dakota, and recounts tales of John & Yoko's relationship. Yoko, who had become John's business manager after the infamous ""Lost Weekend"" period, was distant and aloof towards her husband-yet still controlling of John-juggling relationships with two other men at the same time. She goes so far as to command John to enter a period of silence in which he is not allowed to speak for a number of days. She spends much of their marriage on the phone in her bedroom, and John has to ask her assistant if she has the time to see him. Despite the dismal state of John's relationship, the author shows John entering a happier time in his life just prior to his murder in which John was again writing songs, making an album, and promoting his music."
1,Pathetic - don't buy.,Season 1 - brillant. Season 2 - great. Season 3 - pathetic. What happened? Don't buy. It's a waste of time and money. Instead - watch season 1 again.
1,"Uneven Toasting, Almost Set Itself on Fire","To say it gets hot is an understatement. I have had this toaster oven for under a year and the top front face of the stainless is charred. How is it burning itself? I don't know.One of the rubber feet also fell off and won't stand to be reattached. Also heats/toasts unevenly. Would love to return it to Target, but am outside of the 90 day return period..."
1,Terribly ineffective at toasting and roasting,"The feature set on this seemed attractive. It's a pretty big space, comes with two racks, and even a rotisserie. ""If it could do all that, then man it must be awesome!"" is what we thought.But we were sorely mistaken: It is extremely inefficient at heating.Toast takes 10 minutes in ""Toast"" mode.No temperature indicator light: I've never seen the indicator light turn off, regardless of how long or how hot I want the oven to be. 40 min for 200 degrees? Light stays on. 5 min for 400 degrees? Light stays on. As a result, I'm forced to constantly watch the item and check the internal temp.Not worth it."

1,Beyond bad,"The third, and hopefully final, entry into the Species series finds a low budget approach taken to the film. Series star Natasha Henstridge makes an all too short cameo in the beginning of the film, as she births a super hot alien/human hybrid with mating on her mind. Besides that, the rest of Species 3 comes off like a made for TV movie, with some bad FX but some nice T&A to go around. The acting is horrible, the story barely makes any sense, and there is hardly any redeeming factor to be found in the film. Fans of the surprise 1995 guilty pleasure hit and even it's lacking sequel may want to check this out since it does continue the tradition of what is in a Species movie: no plot, but a horde of gore and nudity."
1,The Species series devolves with this third installment,"I guess I shouldn't be so hard on this film because it is in it's place, being a straight-to-video production and all. But if MGM was so inclined to shortchange the funding for Species III, then why even waste the little money they threw at it? It's not like you could've really expected anything good to come out of it.Aside from the cheap effects, flying stuntmen in prosthetics who are obviously on wires, bad acting, (which is all excusable for the low-budget) is the horrendously boring storyline, which in an attempt to take the series in a new direction, fails completely (not excusable). Plus the climax was probably the least exciting climax I've seen for a while. And there's enough plot holes that this film could be a slice of Swiss cheese. This will be the last Species film I ever watch. I'm not going to waste money on Species 4, which will even have less money than this did to work with."
3,Species III,I didn't like this one as much as the first two of the series. It seem the more they do the worse it gets.
3,you get what you pay for,"When I received the shipment, the box was in bad shape due to the heaviness of the furniture and also limited packaging. The two corners of the table were a bit damaged but nothing too noticable. The assembly was a cinch taking about an hour just doing it myself. Although I am quite pleased with the design, the quality of the wood and the color, I am somewhat disappointed with the overall quality of the set once it is assembled. The parts do not fit perfectly (I am a bit of a perfectionist) but then again, the whole set was only $300. For that price, this is a good purchase for a temporary fix. This is a cute set and serves its purpose - great for singles on a budget and college students etc."
4,UNDER EYE COVERAGE GOOD,"I use Covermark FM just for under-eye circles -- it works better than other cover products and I have tried them all from department store counters to drugstore products. Covermark FM is very creamy so you can dab it into the skin and it stays all day. I don't use the powder. The downside is picking a color -- the only way is to purchase a ""sample"" at $5 a color for which you will receive a tiny container. I ordered 3 samples in the color range I thought I needed and was able to make the perfect pick. So add that cost to the product's cost which is not that high -- it lasts a long time. I probably would not want to use this as my overall foundation unless I had severe cover problems. However, you could mix it with moisturizer -- that would lessen the thickness and you would still get pigment coverage superior to other makeup."
1,Incomplete,"I bought this on impulse at my local bookstore and regret it. Looking up common words in this dictionary is a crapshoot; I've already lost count of the number of times I've dead-ended.The final straw: I just looked up ""English"" and no joy. What kind of an ASL dictionary doesn't include the word ""English""?! :-("
4,Yes M'dear,A good collector's item to add to my repertoire of Miss Lou library. Wish someone would do a written review of he more famous poems.
3,Don't believe the hype.,"This has got to be one of the most overrated works by an otherwise brilliant artist. Not that it's terrible; it's just too bad that many casual jazz listeners' first exposure to Coltrane is through this fairly standard album. Lesser-known albums such as Coltrane's Sound or Crescent are more enjoyable, in my opinion. Of course, the more adventurous stuff on the Impulse label is great, too. But not this."
4,Coasting brilliance,"Though a lot older jazz has lost resonance for me, Blue Train is reminder of the purity of standard structure in the hands of such a brilliant soloist and budding leader, taking what is apathetically mundane nowadays and stamping it with brass immortality."
5,FABULOUS DEAL!!! Great quality and fast shipping!,We have enjoyed listing to the record and loved that it came with a cd too!
3,good but not great,i am more of a fan of the early 60's work of the miles david quintet. this is a nice album and i recommend it. i would recommend several others first though.
5,Blue Note at Its Best,"This is truly an excellent collection of Jazz music. This Cd is approximately 1 hour long and has 7 soundtracks. These soundtracks are mastered in 20-bit Super Bit Mapping by Ron McMaster. The Musicians are John Coltrane, tenor saxophone; Lee Morgan, trumpet; Curtis Fuller, trombone; Kenny Drew, piano; Paul Chambers, bass; and Philly Joe Jones, drums. The 7 soundtracks are Blue Train, Moment's Notice, Locomotion, I'm Old Fashioned, Lazy Bird, and alternate takes of both Blue Train and Lazy Bird."
4,Definetly Worth It,"With great songs like Wayfayer, this CD delivers an enjoyable listen. This is my first Hot Water Music purchase other then the split that they did with Alkaline Trio (the best I may add), and I was surprised that they were just as good without my favorite band in the mix. If you are a fan of damn good music... you may consider this."
2,Disappointing CD,"This cd was not what I expected. Poorly engineered and lackluster performances by two Hammond B-3 giants. I had the album years ago, so maybe my tastes have changed."
2,Meow,"Years later, Gale Sondergaard described this as the kind of movie actors do strictly for the money. Despite the cool cast, the nice title and the very clever packaging from MCA, don't even think about purchasing this incredible turkey... described perfectly in the reviews below."
3,I was disappointed.,"I purchased this CD ,for the most part, because a friend had told me that they sounded like Radiohead. Certainly not the case. They are two completely different bands, sounds, etc. Do not buy this CD if you think they sound like Radiohead. Personally, I don't like Andy's voice, and the songs just didn't reach me. I'm still a loyal Radiohead fan. All of their songs could be singles, and whether Thom's voice is 'chameleonic' or not, it's beautiful. This is the result of an impulse buy. Lesson learned. But, kudos to Unbelievable Truth for getting a CD out, and composing all of these songs. It takes talent to do the above."
2,Made no sense,"This book made no sense to me when I read it. I dug into the book knowing it was mostly going to be hallucinogenic ramblings and stuff, but there was no real plot to speak of. The writing was all over the place, sometimes telling a vague story of how law enforcement was after them for drug trafficking and then suddenly drifting into random nonsense and bloated symbolism. I kept wishing the author would come out of the stoned stupor the whole book felt like it was written in and actually continue with the half-way interesting escape from the law plot, but it kept making less and less sense that I could not ever see picking it up again to give it a second try."
3,(3.5): An Important Yet Flawed Novel...,"I'm not sure how to digest ""Naked Lunch"" let alone write a review about it. Burroughs' text is one of the most important to come out of the Beats, yet it's hard to read and didn't leave me with any sense of satisfaction. The novel is a true example of a novel driven purely by style and form and I think it hurst the overall vision of the text. I understand that the cut and splice and often tangential writing is meant to recreate a junk addicts perspective, yet at the end of the day, if nothing comes out of the text other than ""some of the anecdotes were really something,"" it's hard to say how successful the novel is. Did I like it? At times. Did I enjoy reading it? Somewhat. I most certainly think it's a novel that has an important place in American History and within American Literature, but I don't think it stands up to ""On the Road"" and some of the other texts to come out of the Beat Generation."
1,Not the same shoes you remember,"I suppose that it's inevitable, but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid. They are not. To say the quality is inferior is being kind. The sizes run small as well (about a half size) and A*com will charge you shipping to return it."
2,Not the Stans of old.,"I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them. I used to wear Stans all the time, when a pair would wear out, I would go to the store and pick up another pair, size 11 1/2. I didn't have to try them on, just buy them and go. Beware of doing that with these. I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow, the length is ok, but they are narrow, and squeeze my feet. I could wear them, and they might break in, and stretch, but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports, to get the issue resolved, but the email came back, and when I contacted the website, it didn't get answered. This is a buyer beware situation. The look good, but I don't want to look good and feel terrible. I would not buy these online, go to an old brick and mortar store, and try them on."
1,I used it and it's horrible,"Why put chemicals in your food? I can understand if you can't cook real goulash, but honestly, what is so difficult about onions, salt, and paprika? By the way, this product contains NO paprika. I tried it once when I was in a hurry and was extremely disappointed. The above reviewer who uses it for her goulash and paprikas... shudder."
2,All I can do is scratch my head...,If you're looking for another 'Becoming X' look elsewhere. This isn't even the same band as far as I'm concerned. They never should have tossed Kelli from the band. Not a terrible release....but not exactly worthy of praise either.
3,Mediocre at best,"Well, actually, it depends on what you're looking for. I was looking for something a little more like ""Splinter"", a previous release. The album is well-done, but it failed to grab me as ""Splinter"" did. Lyrically, musically and...whatever else you can judge an album by, ""Splinter"" is just superior to ""Bloodsport""."
3,"Excellent film, but flawed DVD","Undoubtedly, the film is excellent, though I don't call this a masterpiece (I'm still not sure if the narration is too much in this film). But the DVD... not too bad, but when the box tells you that it is FULLY RESTORED, you should expect more from this. A brief scene (about 1 minute) is deleted. When Anne meets Claude again, it takes quite a few days before Anne takes off her bra and goes to Claude's bed. Their conversation on the bed (in which Anne is shown topless) is missing. Some scenes also turn too dark. If you don't mind these, this is still an OK DVD."
1,Not for older eyes,"This game is extremely difficult to play if you don't have the eyes of a hawk. The covered cards are next to impossible to see, and you can't get any other view of them. I returned the game and ordered a different brand."
5,Great book.... misleading title,"This is certainly an excellent book, but it is not the annotated Ulysses that you expect from the Pengiun or Oxford editions. That is, the actual text of Ulysses is not in this book, only lengthy and fascinating information about Ulysses itself. So, I would recommend it, only the title is deliberately misleading. I thought I was getting an annotated version of Ulysses, not a book on annotations about another book called Ulysses."
5,Essential is the key word to all these reviews,"When I first tucked James Joyce's ULYSSES under my arm, Don Gifford's ULYSSES ANNOTATED was tucked under the other. (My biceps became very well developed because of this.) It took me an entire summer to read the books side by side but how worthwhile it was. Gifford's essential line by line, almost word by word, guidance made ULYSSES less overwhelming than if I had tried to tackle it alone. Once I got through ULYSSES the second time (the following spring) I was able to go to the more overarching analyses of Joyce's masterpiece. Stuart Gilbert's ULYSSES and Richard Ellmann's ULYSSES ON THE LIFFEY were particularly helpful."
4,One of the best acting books out there,"""Building a Character"" is certainly one of the books that you can add to your collection if you are an actor, professional or otherwise. Stanislavski discusses the physicalisations and vocalisations that are the product of a character. He also discusses some ethics and attitudes he thinks necessary to maintain in the theater.Highly recommended."
4,A Map for Success,"For the thinking actor and director, Building a Character is a nice slice of help--mind expanding and approach expanding."
3,Pretty good workout,"As others have said, it's not for those with bad knees. The workout involves a lot of jumping and squats.But if that doesn't apply to you, and you're looking for a decent mix of cardio and toning, this is a great buy. I always work up a sweat during the cardio portion. (A couple of the circuits could be a tiny bit more challenging to get your heart rate up higher, so if you're in above-average shape this might not be the video for you.) The 15-minute ""blast the fat"" toning for legs, arms, and abs is excellent. I esepcially like the abs section. Granted, the moves aren't anything I haven't done before, but she does the right amount of reps to make the stomach burn.Lastly, Minna is a pleasant instructor -- her cues are right on and she keeps you motivated without being annoying."
4,Buy this tape!,"I'm on my latest 'must get in shape now' plan and saw this tape at the library. I figured, it's free, why not check it out.I couldn't believe how much this tape kicked my butt. But in a good way.Sure you do a lot of lunges and squats, but Minna always seems to keep you motivated.Why none of the participants in the video were sweating, is beyond me. I definitely got a great workout and will incorporate this tape into my weekly routine."
4,"Very low ""cheese"" factor","I found this video to be a refreshing change from the usual workout video cheerleader tactics. Minna's well-modulated instructions and encouragement allowed me to focus on the workout, whereas I would normally spend much of the time shaking my head at the instructor's silly quips.This workout is an excellent lower body workout that keeps the heart rate high throughout. It was nice to see normal-sized but fit women working out behind her, as well."
3,lusting after a man when your daughter is missing?,"I am a big LC fan and usually love her strong female characters. However, the missing children in this story was really just too distracting. How can anyone fall in lust/love when one's own daughter is missing? That really does not make sense. The story would have been much better if the children's plotline did not drag on for so long. Sorry Miss Chase, this book was not so perfect."
4,Nice to discover another good regency romance writer,"I'm not sure 'Lord Perfect' was in fact a perfect hero, but the book was very entertaining. I laughed out loud in several places. Lovely to have discovered Chase. I thought I'd read all the more interesting authors in this genre."
2,I tried Loretta Chase's ....,"Lord Perfect and Mister Impossible this week. Both were predictable and not unique/interesting enough to get me past p100 or so. In both cases, a smart (semi-helpless)female needs to be saved by a male. I actually don't mind that plot too much but she just does create an intestesting story line like Jen Holling's Shadow Warrior or Lisa Kleypas's Then Came You or It Happened One Autumn or Sabrina Jeffries' A Scot's Revenge."
2,Book with promise falls flat...,"I'm big about all things that concern movie stars, girls becoming famous.. Stuff like that. I love the Princess Diaries.. And I hoped maybe this could be something on my bookshelf along that lines.What started as a great concept fell completely flat. The characters were very two-dimensional, and were not impressed upon long enough for you to get a feel for them before you were pulled in another direction. Things happened too fast, leaving the reader confused.And there was so much left unsaid. I would have loved an extra 100 pages dedicated to character descriptions, tying up loose ends, adding more suspense to the plot. There's a fire on the set and about 10 pages later you find out who did it. Then the book ends. Not the best read. I'd skip it, or borrow it from someone."
5,Necessity,"Every home should have one. But I am a cooler freak.This was the size I did not have; not too big, not too small."
2,insulated cooler bag,"the bag kept items cold all night with ice, but it leaked. this made the bag unusable except for the beach. the item could be really good if it didn't leak."
5,"My Favorite Song by Phillips, Craig, and Dean","This is an absolute blessing of a CD. I have used it in our puppet ministry for a benediction (Shine On Us) using sign language. I have listened to it many, many times already. It came in perfect condition.Thank you"
2,Not value for money,"The tape introduces 2 dances only - ""Cha Cha"" and ""Salsa"". In the 11min 30sec ""Cha Cha"" section, 3 steps are introduced - 1. Basic Step, 2. Cross Over Break & 3. Chase Turn. In the 11min 30 ""Salsa"" section, 3 steps are introduced - 1. Basic Step, 2. Foward & Backward Walks, & 3. Throwout. If I was able to preview the tape beforehand, I wouldn't have bought it. I many ways I thought it was merely an attempt to get you interested enough to take lessons at Fred Astaire Dance Studio's, because it was so, so, basic. Worst Point - In the ""Cha Cha"" both the lady and gentleman dancer wore clothing that tended to obscure a good view of the thigh and knee movements especially. Best Point - I guess both demonstrators were perfectly technically correct in everything they did."
1,Skip this!,"Terrible voice, depressing indoor scenery, incredibly disjointed routines. Don't bother with this one! Save your money."
3,Just above excellent club demo,"Very Sam Phillips recording. Everything lively bubbles up out of slap bass and fuzz tone guitar. Very nice chromatic harmonica work, a la Little Walter. Hints of swing jazz. Vocal duties shared between a rockabilly-esque white guy and a more elderly African-American guy. Fun and listenable, with no mistakes. Lyrics largely simple commentary on love and women. Love to see them live"
4,almost too much of a good thing,"Artemus Ward was recommended to me as one of the major inspirations for Mark Twain's style and work. I can clearly see that. It is an amazing volume of work for a man who lived such a short time. I enjoyed the quality of his satire, although I have to break it up in doses to keep from feeling overwhelmed. Like Twain, Ward could be relentless."
3,Hard to get a replacement part from CTA,"I bought a CTA Inverter for car and plane and I have to say that it works fine. However, after a trip I've misplaced the main cable for the inverter, and contacted CTA by e-mail to purchase a replacement cable, but couldn't get them to reply to me after four or five e-mails. So I'm buying another one but not from CTA."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!","This is the singularly most awful Christian music CD I have ever heard in my life. Rebecca St. James's voice sounds pathetic and whiny, and her lyrics are overdone and drab. She sounds like a little kid whining for some candy at the sweetshop. I'm glad that I got this CD as a gift, and didn't waste my hard-earned money on something this stupid. Do you want to hear some real Christian music? Listen to Jennifer Knapp's ""Kansas,"" dcTalk's ""Jesus Freak,"" and ""Supernatural,"" and Point of Grace's ""Life, Love, and other mysteries."" But whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,OK,"Rebecca's album ""God"" is a classic but this album isn't as good as it, nearly! Sure, there's great songs like ""Pray"", ""Love to Love You"", ""I'll Carry You"", and ""Mirror"" but there's quite simple songs too, such as ""Hold Me Jesus"", ""Peace"", ""Lord You're Beautiful"", and ""OK"" (the keyboards like in Depeche Mode songs) that don't deserve much attention! The last song ""Omega"" is a great one and it's a nice way to finish this album! Rebecca has such a great song and I only hope that they would have produced this album better and made better ideas!Stars: Pray, Love to Love You, I'll Carry You"
4,Great CD,This CD was one of RS James best. All the songs were encouraging and had a great tune. Keep it up!!
5,Great Album,"Pray, of Rebecca St. James is a great album. The music has a lot of truth in it and it really made an impact on my life."
2,If I could return it I would,"Not well made, and not worth what I spent. Would have rather spent the money on food."
4,Great Book for Kids,I first read an excerpt of this book in a basal. My students loved it. I then bought the book so I could read the rest. I read it with my students (5th grade) this year. It was loved by all. It is just a fun book!!
5,From My Childhood,My parents read me stories from this book when I was a child. Over and over again. Sweet stories from a different era. They should make a movie of this book.Look for spelling and continuity errors in these stories. Are you a boy skunk or a girl skunk? A delicious old family receipt?
4,A Great Book!!,I think that Homer Price is a good book. The book is about Homer and the funny adventures he has. The book is easy to read and I think any personality would like Homer Pice.By Ben
5,It was magnificent I loved it.,"The Book was great! Whenever I read a new story in it I felt like I was going in to a new adventure. My favorite story is about an old man that comes to town with a big truck, and he had a big tarp on the back of it. The town had a problem with mice. The old man whistled a tune and some mice jumped out of a drawer and followed him to his truck. He took the tarp off and there was a house for mice that looked like a big organ, and it played that same tune the old man whistled. All the mice in the town follwed the truck as it drove away. That was the end of the story."
5,for all ages,"I don't think Centerburg Tales and Homer Price are only for young people, I enjoy them thoroughly and I am 33 years old now. Have read them several times. - Also great for reading aloud to young people / kids! SUCH fun!"
2,"SO,SO","This CD is not bad at all ,i was just expecting more since from a Swedish Death Metal band. Thunderbeast may grow on you but at first its not that enjoyable and nothing really catches the listeners attention. I recomend Night In Gales - Towards The Twilight first and then give Thunderbeast a try but don't expect to blown away by the CD."
2,A letdown,"I rushed to pick this up after seeing the movie, loving every second, and was happy to see the entire film being a one volume comic adaptation instead of a 4 part mini-series or something. After getting past the awesome cover, replicating the film's poster, I was happily surprised to see the art style being that of film-image duplication for the majority of the book. These panels were lifted right from the movie, which itself is rare with adaptations of this sort. However, some panels were overly scratchy and rough, the art style intended of course, but regardless it left a lot to be desired, especially in the slapdash way the final 20 minutes of the film were compressed to a page and a half in the comic.Overall I'm still happy to have it, and I smile whenever I see the book, its just that I likely won't be reading it again for a very long time thanks to the artwork, which is a shame what with the adaptation being spot on with the film."
3,Puzzle of Love,"I enjoyed Truffant's early work, ""400 Blows"" and ""Jules and Jim"". They are real landmarks in Cinema, the ""French New Wave,"" but by 1979 Truffant seems to be autobiographical with kiss and tell scenerios. His failures in love are examined. His final success in relationship is a clever romatic answer to a puzzle, a torn photograph of his latest lover. It's not overly convincing, but nobody makes movies with so much poetic conceit as the French. The women are beautiful, but I must say that the two blondes are difficult to tell apart and the captioning does not help. This is a date flick for college educated guy and gal, very romantic and sexy without the plumbing."
4,knorr aromat,Excellent for seasoning meat or chicken and for cooking in place of salt. i have used this product for sometime now it can also used as table salt.
1,Pure Industrial Chemical - Toxic MSG -,"For anyone who suffers from adverse reactions to Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) this should be avoided. MSG is the main ingredient. For me causes Migrane headache within 30 minutes - thats for all MSG containing foods, not just this."
4,Fun to read! But to cook...,"As a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, I thought this would be interesting to read. And it is! The recipes are divided into sections according to events in the books, with excerpts preceding the recipes. However, one must have plenty of time and equipment to make the famous ""puddings"" of the era. Most of the pudding recipes call for suet as a key ingredient. That, and lack of a pudding-basin, ended my interest in attempting a Spotted Dog. However, I may attempt a few of the biscuits...as long as they don't require suet! As a companion to understanding the cuisine of Nelson's Navy, however, it's absolutely delightful."
5,ALL HAIL THE GURUS!!!,"This is one of my all time favourite albums!!! Leilani, Kamikaze Pilot, In The Echo Chamber, Tojo, I Want You Back, Arthur, Let's All Turn On.... every song on this album is a legend. Great fun rock 'n' roll. Everybody NEEDS to have Stoneage Romeos."
3,"like wow, wipeout!","Back in the '80s most of us thought Australia made good beer and movies but certainly not good music. Having said that, the band itself is great but their debut LP is uneven. ""Turn On,"" ""I Want You back"" and ""Tojo"" are beyond awesome especially the latter with its singalong chorus and its tip of the bush hat to their knowledge of WWII history.The problem is other tracks either go on too long after promising intros or contain repetitious drum beats. Plus ""Death Ship"" sounds too much like aping the Damned's Dave Vanian on lead vocals.Get their greatest hits instead and just print out this cover for some cool artwork."

We feel that you should be aware of what songs are on this album before making your purchase. Enjoy!]"
4,Chastain Park,"Actually, the concert was release originally in 1985, probably recorded in 1984. The CD version of this concert has to be the most recorded CD on different labels of all time. For some reason, no one has the copyright or someone is selling it to everyone. I personally have seen about 50 different versions of this concert on CD and there are probably well over 100. Sometimes the track list is the same as the concert, sometimes they change the songs around, sometimes they leave some of the songs, other times they add 'Sex Machine' and/or 'Body Heat' from LIVE IN NY 1980 to fool us JB fans!!The concert was good. Mr. Brown was getting near the end of the times he would do the splits. You can see it was getting harder for him at age 51 or 52. Just a year od so earlier IN 1982 OR 1983 he was able to do them much better in the DVD concert JAMES BROWN AT THE BEVERLY WITH B. B. KING."
2,Great performance but POOR sound quality!,"This DVD was a disappointment mainly because the sound quality was so inferior. Watching this DVD the only way I can tell if the horn section is playing is if the camera shows them with horns to mouth. The performance features James Brown's voice, strong bass guitar, and drums-little else is heard with any clarity."
2,THIS DVD IS HALF WAY ENJOYABLE,"I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT DID NOT LIKE IT. THE BAND WAS TOO LOUD THAT IT OVERSHADOWED JAMES BROWN. I REALLY ENJOY HIS MUSIC ON CD BUT THIS VIDEO IS HALF BAKED. I COULD HARDLY HEAR JAMES BROWN AND BESIDES HE NEVER SANG A WHOLE SONG, ONLY PARTS AND A LOT OF FILLING IN WITH GROWNS. TOO BAD, I WISH I HAD LISTEN TO HE BAD REVIEWS NOT THE GOOD ONES (THESE ARE PROBALY-DIE HARDS)."
2,"Long, boring, superficial and pointless",The Brits do period costume so well. The period and the costume are great. The excellent actors are wasted on an almost plotless movie. Cardboard characters. Interminable. A waste of time.
2,Bad quality transfer,"After a long wait, the quality of this DVD is dissapointing, and not worth it at any price. Without the deep fall colors and contrasts of the original, ""The Shooting Party's"" minor flaws, its sentimentality and heavy symbolism, take over. The print look like a fifty year old Kodachrome slide--washed out, flat contrast and no shadow detail. And the sound is almost as bad.That said, the secenes between James Mason as the estate owner, and John Guielgud as the animal rights activist, are priceless. But why should this print be worse than the one shown on television...?"
1,A beautiful film ruined,"Having waited for ages to find a DVD of this, one of my favourite films, I was thrilled to find it available Across the Pond in R1. That thrill has now turned to despair, however ! This is a classic example of an otherwise beautiful movie ruined by a truly appalling transfer. The perpetrators of this monstrosity should be punished by being locked in a darkened cell for a year, fed only on a diet of bread, water, and a perpetual tape of Britney Spears (any album will do).Save you money for the professional version."
3,Easy Reading,"This is a rather interesting collection of American historical facts. It's a quick read, takes an afternoon, and is a good ""pass along"" book, a book you can freely give away to others. There is a very slight left wing bias to the book but not enough to skip."
3,Good hikes if you can find them,"I tried one of the Griffith Park hikes this weekend and between the map/directions to the trail head being unspecific and there not being trailhead signs at the park, it was quite difficult to find the proper route. We ended up going the wrong way (the back way of the loop) and then found the front end after going up a different trail. It turns out that the book left out a fork in the trail before the fork that we were supposed to go on. It seems like the book is good for the basic hike ideas but a more detailed map would be necessary to find the proper trails."
5,An outstanding critical study,"Spilka reads through Lawrence's major works, and finds in them a coherent philosophical ethic. He sees Lawrence as the great champion of the 'organic' and of the spontaneous wholeness of life. He writes about the way Lawrence uses the form of the novel, the bright book of life to express his ethic of Love.Spilka is an outstanding critic. And however I personally have reservations about Lawrence's ethics, including his obsession with Power this fine study makes his thought eminently clear."
3,truly for professional dancers.,"I love the warmup, but i wish it went a little slower. it's hard to see the correct form of the moves at times because it moves so quickly. i've done versions of this warmup at BDC, but this DVD seems quicker. maybe i'm just a few years older."
4,I love the cuties in this movie!,"I've always loved movies from the eighties; especially this one it's dark, fun and funny. Corey, Jason and the boys make a great team!"
4,Really cool,I remember this video from when I was a kid. This has got to be one of the greatest movies that came out of the 80's!
3,A Fun Movie with an Awesome Soundtrack,"OK, this movie may be fun to watch the first few times but lacks in story. What keeps me going is it's soundtrack. From the opening ""Cry Little Sister"" to INXS's ""Good Times"" this movie definately keeps a beat more than worthy of it's plot. One of my favorite 80's movies."
5,Lost Boys DVD Review,I received The Lost Boys DVD in the exact condition that I was promised. And I enjoy it so much. This movie was excellent. I remember watching it when I was younger and watching it now brought back so many good memories. I will definitely buy from this seller again.
5,Holy Wow...1987,"I saw this movie for the first time last night and I am blown away at how decent this movie actually is. I am already a huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but I had really only seen Jason Patric in The Alamo as Jim Bowie, which he did an excellent portrayal of. I now have WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more interest in Jason Patric. Just a note, the first time I saw the cover, I thought it was Tommy Lee on the front...look closely and you'll see what I mean. =]"
2,This DVD Version Is Pretty Lame...,"I would like to stress that I AM REVIEWING THIS PARTICULAR DVD RELEASE, NOT THE MOVIE. That's why it's getting such a low mark from me. Obviously I like the movie, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. However, I was very disappointed with this DVD's menu options and 'special features'. The menu has no 'play button'. That's right. No 'play movie' option. You can only 'select a scene' (which requires 2 clicks in order to actually start the movie from the beginning). Lame. And, the special features are nothing more than trivia 'readers'. Basically, the lamest kind of special features to have. Needless-to-say, I was very disappointed. It's a shame they didn't make a better product to preserve and honor a modern cult classic."
5,Great Blu-ray of a classic movie.,"I could go on about the film's plot and all that other blather but with a film that's 21 years old I figure you already know that stuff. My review is for the Blu-ray disc itself. This one was done right! The transfer is beautiful! I saw things watching this version that I have never before noticed, like how the recently staked Marco's dried blood on the Frog brothers resembles sparkly fairy dust in the sunlight as they escape the cave; a nice nod to Peter Pan there. Good disc, worth adding to your Blu-ray collection."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"As another viewer pointed out, this movie came out in 1987. I believe only those who seen the movie in the theaters when it came out can give this movie a proper review. I personally did see this movie when it came out in the theaters. I did not know what to expect not seeing the reviews and as a result experienced one of the best movies created in the 1980's. I believe it is a must see for vampire fans."
4,Cult movie for teenagers,"Joel shumacher is not a great director but 'The Lost Boys'is a pretty good horror movie and certainly his best realisation. A film dedicated to youth, with a good casting, an original story, nice scenes and a lot of humour ! This is what 'The Lost Boys' are... a 80's pop corn movie at the top, and an intelligent horror film. Waiting for a remake with better FX... as each cult movie deserve it !"
5,i love kiefer,"this is the best film i have eva watched.Like a lot of girls the reason i watched it is for kiefer sutherland he looks so yummy, even as a vampire. I think the film is soooooo funny esp the grandad with his one liners and the frog-brothers are really funny 2. I have got the video and i have to say it is the most watched video in the house. This film is a must see. Even the soundtrack to the film is gr8 the best i have eva heard."
5,perfect!! llego sin problemas,"llego sin problemas! gracias! muy buena pelicula, se las recomiendo, y llego muy rapido a mi casa, solo tres semanas"
4,"""It's the attack of a little Eddie Munster!""","I LOVED this movie as a kid. Definitely dated, but still a lot of fun. Just image.........moving to a strange new town in sunny California........only to find out the new gang that you're hanging with are a bunch of teenage vampires!!!! This is such a cool movie. The soundtrack is awesome; it fits the movie perfectly. Not a bad transfer to DVD either!"
4,A SOLID VAMPIRE MOVIE FROM THE 80'S ! NICE 2 DISC DVD!,"What is this? A Vampire movie staring teenagers from the 80's, featuring the two Coreys.....and it's good? Yes! This film had everything going against it and yet it went over well and has become a cult classic. I always liked this film, but it seems to have aged well with the exception of some generic 80's music and styles. The cast is very good and the tension and comedic overtones are well balanced in this new age vampire yarn. One of the best from the 80's horror archives. The 2 disc DVD edition has a nice DVD transfer and an excellent amount of extras for a film like this."
5,"people are strange,when you a stranger,faces look ugly,when you alone","i really love this movie! i first seen this movie when i was 9yr,and to this very day i love this movie! the music was great,and the coolness of all the teens of this movie was perfect! if you liked the days of guns n roses back in 1988,this movie would bring you back!this is a horror flick but to me its a cool smooth i wish i was a vampire flick! even the little surprise at the end of the movie was just great! this movie brought you back to the 80s and heavy metal rocknroll! if you just look at the cover of this movie, you should see the hardcore coolness of the teens of this movie! everyone should own this great under-rated vampire movie!"
1,Two hours I'll never get back,"My girlfriend made me watch this movie. Halfway through I was fantasizing about Corey Feldman staking me through the heart just to end the agony. Horrible acting, cheesey dialog, half baked delivery, and worse, it's not remotely funny or cool. Except for Corey Haim's clothes. Those are funny."
4,Never Never Land Was Never Like This...,"This film is really more of a comedy than it is a drama, which is not surprising given that the heroes are teenage boys trying to stay one step ahead of the blood-sucking undead. This is not a great film, but it is fun if you accept the premise, which is, ""What would happen if you discovered there were vampires in the neighborhood?"" Besides, Keifer Sutherland has always been a good bad guy ever since ""Stand By Me."" ""The Lost Boys"" is not a chiller and was not intended to be, so this is a vampire film that is going to be appropriate for young teens. You have to admit, there are not many of those around."
3,"Nice bracket, but there are NOT two brackets included","I was unpleasantly surprised when I ordered this bracket and, unlike what the picture shows, there was only one bracket included in my order, not two. I had only two options, return the bracket--because one bracket is useless to hold up a shelf--or buy another one. Since I would lose money returning the bracket, I ordered another one.Basically, I ended up paying twice what I thought the bracket was worth.In terms of the bracket itself, it is attractive and functional and does what a bracket should do.I rate this 4 for the bracket itself and 1 for false advertising."
5,Love this cookbook!,"I've owned this cookbook for several years now and keep going back to it over and over again. The recipes are yummy and practical. No hard to find ingredients or difficult techniques. Just delicious, tried and true recipes. Perfect for everyday cooking for your family or if you want something special for company. Its also interesting to know what inns the recipes were submitted from. Being a New Englander, I've stayed in some or are familiar with where they're located. I have many cookbooks but this is probably the one I refer to the most."
5,A Horrifying Must Read,"I've read the bible, but it has been awhile. The stories are so horrible your first reaction is to say ""know way these are in the bible."" Then I picked up my bible & followed along. They are all in there! This book demonstrates how immoral the bible is along with Christianity. The main question is should you let your kids read it? If you let them read the bible then there is no reason not to let them read this. I probable won't hand this book to them on their own, but I will go over some of the stories with them. The best use of this book is to give it to Christians to make them aware how horrible their holy book is."
4,Britains Best Band,"""Six"" is Mansun's second album. If you bought and loved their first album ""Attack of the Grey Lantern"", you're in for a suprise. ""Six"" is like ""Attack.."" still pop-music but much harder to listen to. The lyrics are difficult to understand unless you are a trained poetry-reader, and the music demands a great deal more from the listener than ""Attack.."" did. Allthough its a difficult album I would strongly recommend it to musiclovers. Their voices are beautiful and they really know how to handle their instruments. Do yourself a favour and listen to the album 8-10 times, and I'll asure you that you are going to love it. I'll rate ""Attack.."" five stars and ""Six"" four."
3,Fun to watch - if you're a fan of the actors,"I'm a big fan of Martin Milner's, and that's the sole reason I bought this movie. Fun to watch to see Mr. Milner in a post-Adam-12 role, and enjoyed a few of the other cast members as well. As mentioned, the movie itself is pretty cheesy with some cheap looking special effects and some over the top drama by a few of the minor cast members. Thank God for the fast-forward button - some moments were incredibly boring and dragged on and on, but all in all, not so bad, & worth a few bucks if you're a fan."
5,Awesome!,"How To Train Your Dragon is a great book. It's humorous and there is adventure in this incredible book also. What I love about this book is that Hiccup, the Chief's son, changes from a coward to a hero."
4,must have book for Latvian travel,this is a great companion book for the Dicionary and phrase book.It has many words that the other does not .
2,Not very useful,"I was excited about this product when I ordered it. I read the reviews and an off site endorsement that claimed it was ""essential"" for working on shoulder and neck muscles.This is a small device, easily held in one hand. I can use it on my neck muscles, but it does not offer enough leverage to use on my very tight shoulder muscles. I can reach the muscles with it, but I cannot use it to loosen up the primary muscles I planned to use it for. I can work on the smaller muscles in my arms and it does feel relaxing to roll it over the muscles in my face. It is too small to do much good on my legs and calves.I do not find it an ""essential"" tool. Speaking for myself, I believe there are better tools to use on my shoulders that will loosen my shoulder muscles. I just have to find the right tool and this is not it."
3,GOING PUBLIC... or not?,"Though I found the book to be humorous and at times enjoyable, I felt the author could have done a better job trying to prove his point. It was hard to tell whether he was trying to say going public is the best way to maximize profit or if it is the best way to bring on an early heart attack. He blatantly describes the travails of MIP's computer company as they try to go public (he describes the extraneous hours, constant, and fears). Though he was trying to show that despite the problems and hard work there is a substantial gain, I was so sucked into the pitfalls that I wasn't sure if the gain was worth it. I would recommend this book to people who want to learn about going public versus staying private, it will help you know what you're getting yourself into."
1,Ask the other survivors for a very different view.,"Chief Picciotta took a horrific day in our city and country's history and tried to turn it into a personal account of his own so-called heroism. How dare he disparage the other people trapped in that stairwell who proved to be ultimately more courageous and more useful than he was. Many FDNY personnel can discount much of what he has stated as ""truth"" and it is really a shame that this fictitious book has become a bestseller. If you want to know the real story of what occurred that day in Stairwell B, ask the other 13 men and woman who were trapped with him that haven't felt the need to shout their heroic feats to the world."
5,a great summer readI,"I picked up this book expecting to learn about what went on with the rescue workers in the World Trade Center. I learned this and so much more. This book described firefighters in sights and dedication to saving lives. I could not put it down. Even though the subject is so serious, The way it is written is inspiring. I highly recommened reading this book"
3,A Bit Self-Indulgent,"As other reviewers have noted, the author seems to have been Superman on 9/11/2001. But this is his perspective on that day, and it gives one man's view of the events. The writing style seemed a bit amateurish, but I think it made it more ""in his words"".It was an entertaining story, though, and I recommend it... especially if you are fascinated with the events of 9/11/2001 in the US."
3,Could've Been Better,"When I first began reading Last Man Down, I found it to be very interesting and I really liked it. I began to tell all of my friends and even my family members that they should read it but my opinion quickly changed. The further I read into the book the more I noticed that the focus of the book went from the horrifying events of 9/11 to Richard Picciotto himself. I mean this was the first book that I have read on 9/11 so I can't compare it to anything but I still think that someone else could've done better on explaining what happened that day. I was asked what was the first thing that sticks out in my mind when I think back about the book and that is that Richard is in very good shape. When that should be of minor importance and what happened that day day should have greater importance. Well that's my opinion and thanks for taking your time to read it."
2,Excessivly ornamented cembalo,"This is the most boring record I've ever heard of Jordi Savall. In fact is more irritating than boring and for my ears it's all due to the ""crispy"" work of Ton Koopman over the cembalo. How I wished that these sonatas were recorded in a full stereo! If so we could have had one speaker for each instrument and then have the chance to ""miss"" Koopman and left Savall alone. That wouldn't be the sonatas, but at least it would have been pleasent music."
5,Amazing! Incredible! Heartstopping!,"Dralion combines amazing acrobatics, hilarious clowns and beautiful music into one. This is a must have for anyone, and thats why I recomend Cirque du Soleil's Dralion as a 5!"
2,VERY disappointed!,"The performance was terrific, but the editing and camera work were TERRIBLE. There were countless times when at the most exciting moment of a stunt, the camera would cut away and show the audience. I also think they spent too much time with the camera on the singers. Don't get me wrong - the singers were great and added a lot to the music, but by filming them, they missed some of the stunts. A couple months after I saw the video, I saw Dralion live and it was amazing. It was hard to believe it was even the same show. Whoever allowed this video to be released should be ashamed. It is not at all representative of the wonderful work Cirque du Soleil produces."
5,Dralion-my favorite Circuque du Soliel,"I saw this show live and just had to have the DVD. Believe it or not, it's even more awesome than the live show! It 's very well directed and I love the camera shots. The seller was accurate in the description and shipping was fast."
3,Not sure what to make of it,"When I first heard they were doing an anime, I pretty much ruled it out because I'm not an anime fan. Now I've only seen a few clips here and there and from that I think some of the scenes are really cool and I'm starting to become more interested in watching it.The only issue I have is that I wish instead of copying actual SPN episodes {even if they changed certain things about it}, they had decided to make them all new. Because why would you want to watch the same episodes in anime format? I just don't get it. And I wish Jensen had been able to voice all the episodes.HOWEVER,Like I said, I thought some of the shots were really cool, the trailer made it look exciting and I think overall, it's going to be more hillarious than anything else.Dean's butt dance is just one example of why."
3,Do you like anime?,"This is an odd offshoot. Almost like a partial re-boot of the series. It starts back at the beginning of the series and it is as different as it as the same. The look and feel of the TV series is very important and this cartoon changes that. Sam is voiced by the actor, but Dean is not, so the brothers interactions seem off. The look of the chars is significantly different too, so that is jarring. I think if you like japanese anime, understand that it is their version of Supernatural not the Americanized series, you will be OK. If you don't, you will hate it. I have not decided if I will watch the whole series. I am tempted because I love Supernatural and would like to see some more of the brothers and their encounters but I will have to wrap my mind around the changes in order to enjoy this offering."
2,LOST over the Atlantic,"As a fan of SUPERNATURAL...This Anime Series is a disappointment. Voice sound is off. What happened to my MAN Dean?! Poor Bobby is mangled beyond recognition....looks like Wimpy,(Popeye) Did the animators actually watch the series??? Missouri Mosley looking like Ms Cleo....Do they draw African characters by taking the rejects of other drawings and just fill in black ink??? I purchase this item expecting it to expand the world of the Winchesters. NOT!!! I've seen better anime...Justice League, The Red Hood etc..... I hope the next person who attempts this is someone who knows the series & is wise enough to include the original characters to make it work. After all it only took 6 tries to get BATMAN (The Dark Knight) Right."
5,Great story,"It's amazing what memories having children can unlock, my daughter's getting into fun with aliens and I suddenly remembered this book from my childhood. I'm happy to share it with her."
5,great price,for the price and the amount of paper you get it is truly worth it. paper is quite sturdy and does what it needs to do for arts and crafts time.
5,Nice colors,Bought this for my daughter who teaches preschool. We both loved the colors and the weight of the paper was good for what she would use it for. Great for inexpensive projects at the preschool or daycare.
4,"Hair, skin and nails","I have been taking them religiously, and it seems to make my hair look nicer and strong. Seems they are working well."
3,A pretty good workout- but not the best,"I am a 14 year old girl who likes to do fitness videos to keep fit.This video is yoga poses with dance steps. The music is kind of cool, but it was difficult since I am not very advanced. After a while I get too tired and can't finish it.Minna is really pretty and very fit, and a good insturctor, but this is not one of her best tapes! I would recommend it for more advanced people and not beginners. It is a great tape for people that don't like only yoga!"
2,Not for Pilates or Yoga lovers!,"I was very dissapointed by this video. This workout does not demonstrate Pilates or yoga. For example, Minna and her crew are wearing athletic shoes, and if you know anything about yoga or Pilates...need I say more? This video is bouncier and more aerobic than I anticipated, and I have more that enough bouncy, aerobic videos."
2,Not the best instructor,"The actual workout presented on this tape is not bad, however I can hardly stand to watch it due to the behavior and comments of the instructor and other participants. I found Minna to be pretty annoying, some of the comments she makes are truly innane and instead of focusing on the pose, I find myself wondering what the heck she meant by the comment. She sounds stilted and unnatural, like she had a script to memorize and is simply reading it. After doing a pose, she'll say - I know this is hard, its hard for me, too; and she sounds so artificial. The final annoying piece is the other people doing the workout - they have bright, fake smiles on their faces throughout the workout. No one I know actually grins through a tough workout. I have used other yoga videos with much better instructors, such as Sarah Ivanhoe of Crunch. I'm selling this video and buying another one of hers."
3,compare your pet to the reviews before you buy..,"I gave it a three because it looks nice and the price was good. However, I won't be able to use it for one hamster --it's huge and I'd rather he use that space for making own nest with bedding . The bottom is approx 6"" circle, sides are 3"" in back, 2"" in front. (not what I think of as ""mini""). The current photo of brown bed with one hammie is misleading. And the interior is white fleece not a dark color so yuck. The reference in other reviews to an earlier photo with three pets ? that's from the tag, and it looks photo-shopped anyway. This is probably good for 2 hamsters rats, or baby litter, but not guinea pigs."
5,Wonderful! is exactly what it says it is!,"This bra is the best sports bra ever! As a 32DD, bras can be a challenge to find, let alone sports bras. This bra holds the girls in place for an entire work out and then some. I can run and spare in this bra and no bounce! While the bra is tight and I wouldnt choose to wear it everyday just for fun; it does get the job done! No more wrapping the girls down and no more uni-boob, now I can focus on the activity at hand and not be self conscience. If you have tried everything as hand or perhaps just want the best from the start. you need not look any further."
1,Don't Order,"Please save your time and money and don't order this sports bra. I have researched sports bras and tried many sports bras. After the research, I had to try Enell. Everyone was positive about it. I did read several comments about the thick seam across the breast, but I ignored the comments and ordered the bra. I was so excited to receive the bra in the mail, but after putting on the sports bra, I was extremely disappointed. The bra is supportive and holds you in place but you cannot wear the bra to the gym under a t-shirt. It looks awful with a thick seam over your breast and it is impossible to hide. So, I returned the bra. Trust me, don't waste your money!!"
1,Horrible Bra,This is more like a harness than a Bra. I don't know if it would be comfortable or not as I could not even get it fastened. The sizing was very confusing. The only good thing about it was it was easy to return.
5,This is my favorite brand of bladderwrack,I saw bladderwrack listed in the blood type diet book for Type O and have been taking it for years ever since then. I haven't noticed any weight loss (like some of the other reviewers) but I've got a small frame and don't really need that. What I do need it for is to keep my PMS symptoms at bay. Whenever I stop taking it I get a killer 2-day headache related to my menstrual cycle.I've tried other brands over the years but this one seems to work the best. The Eclectic Institute bladderwrack seems to be getting harder to find in the stores (and it never did seem like a common item in health food stores). So glad Amazon carries it.
3,Not Typical Bonnie,"Bonnie ventures into more jazz-like compositions with this album. I listened more than I danced, unusual for Bonnie's releases."
4,Too much production,"I love Bonnie and always will, but this album was a bit disappointing. Over produced and not enough of Bonnie, her guitar and those blues that stir the soul. Guess I'm just a more traditional Bonnie Raitt fan and not much of a fan of big production efforts. This isn't the first album that has, in my opinion been lessen by production efforts. But I'll stick with one of my favorite ladies and hope for the best next time."
4,ALMOST HEAVEN,"wow!this is fantastic album,but not perfect.some songs are a little bit boring.but,there are one of best song for all times-fell in love with an alien!"
4,Fun!,This book has a fabulous ending! And just when you think the book is coming to an end... there's still more to go! Which I love. Enjoy!
1,my perspectiv,"the title is very amusing one could say. thats what got me sucked in. i wanted to look at an apolegtic view of archeology and historicity of the bible. unfortunately this dvd does not carry those qualities. very repedative, does not have anything a 6th grade history book doesnt already have on the middle east, and so boring. ive seen a dozen movies on archeaology of the bible, and i must say this was the worste. you wanted my opinion and i am trying to speak unabashingly that this movie has no left hook, nothing outstanding, and doesnt even get to the point until 45 minutes in. watch a preview of it on youtube before you buy it"
5,A Charming Book Filled With Lighthouse Adventure!,"This gem of a book tells four stories of women lighthouse keepers. The tapestry of characters with the blend in different writing styles was heightened by the beautiful backdrops.In ""When Love Awaits"", a woman named Fiona falls for the persistant, Scottish Ian. In ""A Beacon in the Storm"", Amanda's one wish is to remain the lighthouse keeper - until she becomes sidetracked. With ""Whispers Across the Blue"" one feels the emotions of lovesick Jule praying for her fiancee who is out to sea. Lastly, in ""A Time to Love"", Eden has given up on love- but love has not given up on her.A delightful, cozy read filled with inspiration and romance in the Lord's hand. This book is highly recommended!"
2,leaking,"When i got it and put it together, it looked awesome.. but when i started running it, it started leakin where the motor is connected to the container. it sucks.. so i had to grab the whole thing and drag it to the sink so i dont mess up the wood floor. i used plumber's tape around where the O-ring is and it quit leakin.. the filter part of it works great.. the skimmer? not so much.. blows so much bubbles but doesnt make any skim...overall, its just a filter."
3,Psychology Majors only,"Unless you're a peychology major, you probably won't get much out of this film. In this movie, our main character preforms various sexual acts and then violently attacks and often murders his victims. If you are interested in psychology, you can see a deeper meaning to the violence and sexual display and into the mind of this corporate executive. I recomend this movie for those interested in psychology. For everyone else, this movie is probably a waste of your time."
2,Where is the ending?,While I enjoyed most of this movie I just have to wonder what happened to the ending? It left too many unanswered questions and too many useless characters.
4,Christian Bale is Phenomenal!,"Although the movie is overall dark in subject matter, it's a must-see-movie thanks to Christian Bale. The character he plays is hellacious, but Christian is heavenly. Not only does he look so beautiful from head to toe, but his acting skills far surpass most others. And luckily, for people like me who don't like gruesome material, the director cuts away from the violence taking place in the film."
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","As much as I love the film, American Psycho, I can't help but feel cheated by this ""Uncut Killer Collector's Editoin."" There is only one minute, and I'm not exaggeration, of extra ""uncut"" footage. Not only that, but the footage is almost unnoticable. The only decent attributes of the DVD itself are the new deleted scenes, however there are only four. The rest of the speical features were junk, a TV special on the 80s, which I didn't care for, and a reading of an essay by some Blonde chic. Huge sell out if you ask me."
4,"Christian Bale, We Want More!!!","American Psycho is a great movie, full of colour and tone. Although the violence is rather severe in some scenes, it's brushed off as nonchalant business by the yuppie, male-model, capitalist, bourgeoisie ""pyscho"", played devilishly by Christian Bale! It's a great performance and along with a super supporting cast headed by another incredibly talented actor, Jared Leto, the movie picks you up and carries you away on a wave of mayhem, pulsating to the music of Phil Collins and Genesis while sporting a maniacal grin with glee!"
5,a must have for any big fan of the movie/book/Christian bale,the 2 separate commentaries by Harron and Turner were very insightful. The several featurettes were great. I definitely recommend this movie
3,not bad,"Mainly reflects, in the most satiric way of course, the lifestyle of the cynical and cearless wallstreet businessculture. It brutally critizises materialism in our society. This is a pretty violent film and many people haven`t been able to see throught all the gore in what`s the film really about. It`s not anykind of serialkiller thriller.It's still not perfectly directed and the kind of novel adaption it most likely could`ve been. Anyway, Christian Bale fits quite perfectly in his role of the superfical caricature of a businessperson.-""american ding-dong"""
3,Totally blew the pooch,"I really liked the book and was looking forward to the movie. The movie is so-so. As movies usually do, this one totally missed the mark and the book was better. While I won't say the movie was bad (I'm not buying it) it wasn't very good either. Maybe I expected more, I don't know. The actors were good and fit their parts. But, the movie just left out parts and changed this around from how the book did them, so I feel the movie blew it."
1,Worst Movie we have ever watched. Made zero sense especially the end.,Don't bother watching this horrible movie. The plot (if that is what you could call it) is really bad. The movie stinks.
1,American Psycho - OVERKILL,"'American Psycho' is about a man who thinks his 'mask of sanity is about to slip'. He has a tendency to go crazy and kill guests at his home. He uses chainsaws, axes, knives. Lots of unpleasent things to make sure his innocent victims stay DEAD. You don't see him killing anyone. Just the dead bodies, but that is not the point.With such talented actress's like Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis, it is extreamely disappointing to find that they are totally wasted in this movie. They deserve a lot better.....Hopefully with such small parts, people will forget that these two women are in this shocking movie and not hire it.This movie should have stayed as a book."
5,Maybe you had to be there.,"First, let me say I never read the book...only knew there was controversy about it. So, when I started laughing early in the film at the dead on depiction of the souless consumerism, competition and shallowness of the early 80's, I was a little confused. But, I was also unexpectedly delighted. Don't the people who hate this movie realize that it is a brilliantly done social satire and a truly dark comedy? Expertly casted, played perfectly and directed with finesse and humor, we not only get a picture of the times but also an understanding of the slide into madness. Excellent."
4,Video Quality Review (Blu-ray),"In a word, theatre. A bit of dirt, a touch of grain, some obvious edge enhancement at times, even somewhat muted contrast but still nice if flat coloring, great flesh tones, and plenty of detail gives this blu-ray transfer a night at the local cinema feel. I didn't mind it. Not that this type of transfer should be encouraged but given the material I sort of liked the look. Reminded me of when I used to go out to see a movie. Truth be told the print used needs some cleanup and titles needing some cleanup should get it before going HD. My rating is a little generous but given the film's setting of the decadent 80s the weathered megaplex look, even if due to lack of care, worked rather well.(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92"")"
1,Don't waste your time,"The only thing good about this movie is that it wasn't long enough to waste two hours of my life, just 1.5. It just goes on and on, and about halfway through it stops making sense. Hollywood physics runs rampant through this movie. As well, it has the bumbling Hollywood police who apparently never do anything right except die as quickly as possible. Beyond that, the main character just drones on and on about bad 80's music. To put it simply, its not even remotely scary, it does NOT make you think about anything except why am I watching this, and the only people who would laugh at this are complete idiots. You should want better. Thank you"
1,Not what I consider good.,"I just watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say I didn't like it. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I found it to be rather pointless. I can remember when Natural Born Killers (one of my personal faves) was getting into trouble about ""too much gratuitous violence"" and this movie has WAY more than NBK. I found it pointless. All I could see was a self-absorbed sex maniac with an extreme lust for killing. That sums it up. Maybe if there had been a point it would have been better."
1,Save your money!!!,"I saw this one at the theatre. It is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen! I'm not sure which movie was worse, this one or Natural Born Killers. They were both the pits."
4,funny/horror movie,"this movie is pretty funny actually in its own way, i mean look at the picture he has an axe with a suit on and a funny smile. also this movie can change genres so fast from a porno to a straight off chainsaw chasing horror movie. anyway its funny to me. if u like horror movies rent this or buy it. its worth owning, if u like horror movies as much as i do u'll find it funny too."
5,Hey Paul!!!,"This has to be one of the best movies ever made. Christian Bale put on one of the greastest performances by actor that i have ever seen. He really deserved an oscar for the role. As far as the picture quality of the movie for blu-ray, I would have to say it is outstanding. One part in particular stands out, when Patrick Bateman Peels his facial mask off his face I think the picture jumps thru the screen. Its as though your looking right at him. Go Buy this movie and you won't be disapointed."
2,"Blood, Gore, Bad Acting, Lacking Plot",This film is a half baked version of the book. This movie was obviouly thrown togather to attract a simple minded gore lover. The story line is very basic and the end is a rediculous faust of a film ending. Its as if the director knew that this movie was going to be bad so he just quit it allDo Not Buy This ... It is Terrible
1,Horrible Horrible Movie,"This movie was terrible. Barely a plot, horrible acting. I don't know what all the humdrum was about. I hated it."
2,shock without value,"Does the main character have a split personality? Did he really do all those terrible things or did he just imagine it? The ending, direction, and screenplay are so bad, you'll never find out by watching this movie."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Having read and enjoyed the novel, I had no idea what to expect of the movie. However I was pleasantly suprised. American Psycho is not a novel I felt could be well made into a movie- much like Catch-22. But the movie for the most well catches the flavor and themes of the book, and replays some of the best parts of the novel. Christian Bale completely sells the role of Patrick Bateman- a highlight of the movie. The extras are extensive, and the documentaries are well worth watching."
2,TRASH,"Well, if the yuppies who are making thousand or millions of dollars are so stupid and so empty of character as the ones portrayed in this movie, uau, they must be geniuses for being so silly and still marking lots of money.... Anyway, Bale's acting is great, the editing is good, direction is good, but the story sucks."
4,American Psycho,"A parody of the 80's movie that got a lot of press over the vulgar manner it was presented, especially towards women that should completely be negelected.Enjoy the movie for what it is, a very creative and eyebrow raising look at our fascination with serial killers and the vibe of the 80's presented in a very original manner. Similar to the feel and vibe of Natural Born Killers for the 90's. Acting and direction was great and flowed very well, especially in the un-cut version.Enter this movie with the right frame of mind and you will enjoy it and get the message originally intended in the very controversial book."
3,Love the movie but the Blu Ray isn't worth it,"First off, American Psycho is one of my favorite movies of all time. It rocked my world the first time I saw it and I've probably seen the thing 100+ times. Mary Harron's take on Bret Easton Ellis's masterpiece is amazing, and Christian Bale brings the character of Patrick Bateman to life like none other. The brutal acts juxtaposed with Patrick's cool nonchalance is profoundly disturbing and creepy. If you haven't seen the movie, buy it at once.As far as the Blu Ray version goes? Skip it. The intro with the white background looks absolutely horrible on Blu Ray. In fact, I put my old DVD copy in just to see the difference and I think the original upscaled DVD looks better on my PS3. There are no special features on the Blu Ray worth mentioning. Save yourself the trouble and get the DVD version instead."
2,Intriguing Yet Distubing at the Same Time,"Christian Bale stars in this adaption of Bret Easton Ellis' story of the same name. The main purpose of this movie was to tell the tale of a ruthless serial killer that looked like an average guy. It takes place during the 80's and just as in the book, the movie focuses on greed. Money is an object that means nothing but can get you everything that you desire. Drugs, clubbing, eating expensive food, and keeping yourself looking good. All of these are the items that mean everything to the main character. What was disturbing about this film was the killing. It was done with a satire feel, which in itself was interesting and original, but was odd and made you think twice about what you were watching. Bale does a fabulous job with the role, playing a serial killer/business man to the ""T"". It was a good movie, you just have to keep an open mind while watching it."
3,Acustic Album,"I bought this really for one song on the list, I like maybe 3. I recieved it maybe a day after the estimated date, otherwise not a bad CD."
5,Excellent backpack with hidden features,"when I first saw the price of this pack I was a lil disgruntled but I bit the Bullet and bought it anyways. Best backpack so far, Plenty of room for all of my stuff whether it be for school, hiking or just biking around the city. Not only does it have compartments for everything but it has some hidden extras that some of those who bought this bag may not be aware of. the waist straps can tuck in to the lil side pockets kind of like a hole that was not stitched there all the way. The other hidden gem is the chest strap has a lil whistle that can be used if your lost in the woods and people are trying to find you. It's plenty loud as well. just some additional added features that the product description does not tell you. It is also a very durable material that takes allot to tear. Overall I'l glad I spent the extra money for this bag."
4,"Enjoyable, classic Anne Murray fare","I am a longtime Anne Murray fan who has seen her in concert many times. She is a consistent, professional entertainer who stays within the ambit of what she does best: sing. She is not a dancer, she is not a joke-teller, and she doesn't pretend to be. She sings, and she chooses songs that show off her voice to advantage. I enjoyed this DVD, and found the guest performances an added bonus. If you like Anne Murray, you'll like this concert DVD. Hopefully she'll do another one, now that she's put out a few more CD's, especially Country Croonin'."
5,This needs to be reissued,"This three guitar group worked together in 1985 and recorded, as far as I know, just this single album. At the time Sharon was only beginning her career--this was her first recording, Laurindo had recently been the heart of the LA 4, and of course Larry was a premier jazz guitarist. They seem to have such fun playing together. The program is a mix of originals, Brazillian pieces, Manuel de Falla's Canciones Populares Espanolas, and the famous adagio from Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, on which Larry Coryell, two-thirds of the way through the piece, plays a skittering improvised steel-string guitar solo that ices the musical cake. Find this if you can."
5,Best stand I've found,"5 stars for the following reasons:1.) Stackable - each one is 2"" high, so if you want to raise your monitor 6"" then buy 3 of them and stack them up. I'm tall so I stacked 4 of them.2.) Sturdy3.) Great price4.) Small desk ""footprint""5.) Space underneath doubles as a ""shelf"""
4,Jarring,"While this book is so realistic as to be genuinely scary, it will not promote greater harmony between Americans and Muslims. The scenes are jarring, a wake-up call, but where are the solutions to the many questions it raises about America's national security?"
3,"Ecce Romani, 11-B (A Youger Student's Guide to Latin)","This book is the second section of a two part book in the Ecce Romani series. This book text is more motivated to the reading and comprehension level of a youger reader. Each chapter starts with a story yet some chapters the stories have the same content. This book teaches you limited vocabulary and grammar a much needed part of learning latin. Towards the end of the book however the stories get more interesting with better sentence structure. It does however have many good points on Roman history, especially mythology. I liked the facts on Roman life though. This is a good book for a young Latin Scholar."
3,Required reading for wives,"This book revolutionized my marriage. When I realized how selfish I had been, I wondered why my husband put up with me so long. The principles do work and the results are worth the effort. My copy of this book is worn from reading it so often and referring to it when I need guidance."
1,Book About Manipulation Not Love,"The theme of this mindless book is that men are run by ego gratification and women must supply it.Its view of men makes me think that the author has great hatred for the sex and sees men as a means to an end,to take care of her sorry helpless arse,someone to manipulate,someone to not love but fool into loving her.Any woman reading this book should take it with a grain of salt and hopefully she is only reading it for a good laugh and to critic poor writing and a author with limited capacity to truly love."
5,Perfect for some relationships,"This book has been more helpful than marriage counseling at improving, maybe even saving, my marriage. I recommend it to anyone wanting to understand their husband and role in the family better, but especially if your relationship is headed down a rough road try this book before you give up. While I can see how the advice wouldn't fit everyone's needs, the personality types fit my husband and I. This book really helped me to understand what his side of life is like and what his needs are. I needed this information explained from a woman's point of view. I can't express my gratitude enough that Helen wrote this book."
1,A relic from the fifties!,"It's shocking that books like this are still being published and worst yet, being read by women looking for relationship advice. Following this books bad advice makes women into submissive, docile creatures who have to act as if they have no brain. She gives ridiculous advice like pouting and stamping your feet to show that you're angry with your husband! Really???Absolute drivel, only good for a few laughs. It's sad that someone would consider this to be good, solid advice on how to have a happy marriage."
1,"Horrible, sexist trash","Seriously, this book is a piece of garbage, useful only for laughing in disbelief that anyone would ever want to follow the guidelines in it. The author's premise is that women need to be doormats AND able to secretly manipulate their husband. This book is very sexist and enforces rigid gender roles. It may be useful advice for someone who wants a very traditional marriage and is OK with being ""accepting"" of their man even if he abuses her, but for women who want a life apart from being a doormat/manipulator, stay away.The only one who should buy this book is a feminist scholar who wants to deconstruct the ideas contained within it."
1,GAG! PUKE! MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP!,"This book is sickening. If you want to be a doormat and be walked all over the rest of your life, go ahead and follow the techniques in this book! This book makes me want to puke! Basically this book teaches you to lower your standards in order to make someone else happy! Yeah, that makes good sense...."
1,The Best Review I've Heard On This Book Came From Someone Else!,"I have a friend who got this book. I wont mention her name, because I don't think she'd care for the publicity -- but she was single at the time and decided to see how these ideas would help her to attract guys.Well -- it worked. She attracted a lot of guys. There was just one complication.She didn't like the guys she was attracting!'Nuff said."
4,BADGER RESCUED BY JACKIE LOMAX!,"The lame prog slog that was Badger was given a new life with an injection of R&B; from the soulful English Jackie Lomax. The album is really a Jackie Lomax solo album with Badger and friends as back up as all the tracks are Lomax compositions and its clearly in the Lomax style.With regret, this album got even less attention than Lomax's solo outings as many fans didn't know he was in the group and Badger fans were left running back to the comotose offerings of other come and go progressive rock bands.This album has life, heart and soul, and though its not the strongest material of his career, is is a strong 4 stars"
4,More yes than no,Not entirely original but a thumping good read nonetheless. Children between 8 and 12 would certainly enjoy this little fantasy. It's worth a go.
4,Heathers,This is proberbly Winona Ryders and Shannon Dohertys best movie... Always makes you laugh and is a good movie for a quiet nite at home...
5,This DVD is God. Let's go get a Slushie.,My all time favourite movie gets tricked out again with this fantastic collection. This is for the die hard fans (and there are many) who don't mind shelling out some dough for 2 versions of the same movie plus some awesome swag.I didn't even think twice about it even though I already own 1 copy on DVD (the limited edition tin box) and another on VHS.
4,Review of BluRay only,"Just thought I would provide a quick written review of the BluRay production only of this movie. You either like the movie or you don't.The BluRay is pretty good quality, sound is solid and picture is very good considering the age of the film. Proably not worth an upgrade if you own the current DVD release, but a good addition to almost any movie collection."
3,"good movie, but sorry people it's not original.","watch massacre at central high, then you'll know where the idea of ""heathers"" came from. watch both movies back to back and you'll see how much ""heathers"" is like ""massacre at central high."""
1,Another Defective Disc,I have also purchased this and it turned out to be defective as well. Don't know if New World had defective plants or what.
3,Heathers,"I suppose at one time a movie like this one would be considered funny. However, since 9-11, Columbine, and suicide bombers, this movie really loses any appeal it may have had. Christian Slater appears as a wannabe Jack Nicholson/James Dean character who seems to have it in for his peers. He tricks Veronica into killing her fellow students. At first it seems like it was just a scare gag gone wrong, but soon we learn that this kid really is not content until he kills as many classmates as possible.As a parent of a high schooler, I found this quite disturbing and realy not that good of a movie. Some of the performances were decent, but the whole storyline was troublesome to me. I think there is too much emphasis on death in the teenagers world and this film only heightens that emphasis."
1,Couldn't have been worse,"Bah! No wonder it's horrible, it was released in the winter time. A feeble attempt probably to bring the box office out of it's winter slump. This movie has helped me develop a new phobia, properly called Christian-Slaterphobia. This was the worst movie I've ever seen."
5,Terrific Film and a Classic!,I saw this film when it first came out and was amazed how great it was. Winona Ryder and Christian Slader made a classic film and gave performances of a lifetime. The high school cliques get out of hand at the local hight school and two on the outs teens find a perfect way to solve the problem. Teenage suicide dealings get send up and the popular kids are the victims. Two teens end up getting rid of the popular kids by posing them as suicides. Funny and lots of fun.
4,"Great movie, marginal extras, PS2 problems","Heathers remains a whip-smart satire, with a sharp eye to teenage cruelty and a dark heart that only lets up in its compromised finale (the DVD's extras include the screenplay pages for its original ending, which is more true to the tone and themes of the movie).Buying the collector's tin seems a little dubious considering that the content extras, like the documentary ""Swatch Dogs and Diet Coke Heads"" is available on the regular DVD. The bonuses seem to be in the packaging: a tin box, a ""Heathers Rules"" ruler, and a 24-page booklet with clips and quotes from the movie.The other problem here is that the DVD seems unwilling to play in the PlayStation 2 (it always prompts a ""Cannot read the disc"" error), though it works fine in my Mac G4 Cube with Mac OS X. Since PS2 has problems with other DVDs, it's hard to say whether this is Anchor Bay's problem or Sony's."
4,Good Italian Reference Cookbook,"I found this at the local Costco several years ago when I was just starting to bake artisan breads. All of the Rustic bread recipes call for too much yeast and too short a fermentation, but that is easily modified, where it says 2 1/2 teaspoons yeast substitute 1/4 or 1/2 t and add to the fermentation time. Having said that the Biga based breads are some of the most popular in the house. The pizza and foccacia recipes are excellent and work well. The tart recipes are wonderful and are my baseline recipes. There is also a florentine onion (onion and pea actually) soup that is a wonderful soup and one we make routinely.Generally the Rustic breads are good if you practice slow fermentation practices, this was written in the mid 80's before slow fermentation became popular. This is one of the 3 bread books I use routinely along with Daniel Leaders bread alone and the apprenctice baker"
1,When College Ambition goes Wrong,"When asked to write a good review for this book I was faced with a moral dillema between courtesy and honesty. This book rehashes what your high school guidance counselor presented, some common sense, and some sense that is not so common or correct. However, if you seek to read a business guide book, and think that Donald Trump takes too long, then maybe buy this book as it can be consolidated into about ten pages; although, it could benefit from some color pictures."
3,Lovely Pieces,"I had to order this set several times to get at least 4 place settings. The cutlery is lovely though but the knives are turning colors, how sad! Pricey items!"
4,Good product for the price!,"This is a good pan for the price! I wanted to give our daughters something to start with in this type of cookware, but thought Le Creuset a tad too expensive. I liked it enough to add one to my collection of cookware too! My only complaint...there are no instructions for care and usage included and no warranty or manufacturer information anywhere. Amazon has been useless in helping me find the information I need, BTW. Still, for $50 this is a good pan to get!"
3,Demos,"The demos are surprisingly better. This got old quickly, which I was sad to say. Light bubbly fun, some squeaky clean harmonies, cute and biting lyrics that are largely forgetable. Some of tracks did not seem paced well after final production. I will admit, I'm still in love with Gwenno Saunders' voice."
2,Grim and somewhat disappointing,"This book is a compilation of several radio lectures that the German- or Austrian-born author (the name is a pseudonym) delivered over French radio in, if memory serves, the 1950s. I confess to have made it only through the first section and part of the second. The tone is extremely bleak, the prose is difficult (all French prose defies easy translation, IMHO, and comes out sounding imprecise and windy), and the ultimate message is pretty unrewarding: It turns out that old age is even worse than you feared! Don't pick up this book looking for any solace."
5,Brilliant teacher's aid,"In my college writing classes, I cover issues of diversity, and I'm amazed at my students' ignorance of the civil rights movement. All they know is that they get Dr. King's birthday off. This film leaves them shattered, opens their eyes like nothing else I have tried. I would highly recommend it to teachers at the high school and college level if you want to expand your students' appreciation of how we got where we are today and the heroes (and monsters) who lived through it all. Lee's film, which should have won the Oscar, will leave you changed. I recommend it to anyone."
1,what a bunch of bull,"Sorry...written by a woman for women and I am a man....We are different species when it comes to this stuff, but an interesting viewpoint none the less."
5,True love,"When you date in the traditional manner--trying to manage outcomes and get people to like you--you are left living or dating in fear, wondering when you are going to be 'found out' and the love will be lost. Gay Hendricks presents the alternative, one that only some people have discovered on their own.I read Truth in Dating after reading Getting Real most of Brad Blanton's books on Radical Honesty. I found this book to be the best of the genre because it artfully disperses theory, practice, and examples in a format that is easy to digest and relate to."
3,helps alot but dont stick,As far as the not smoking is going they work great. I have smoked heavily for 19 years. Im only on day 3 but never thought I would make it past day 1. They keep falling off and I have been using bandades to keep them on. Its a pain would try a different brand for the next boxes.
3,Mixed feelings...,"I just finished reading this book and want to share the impression.I expected more. It is simple, sometimes too simple. I can hardly imagine the person with non-finance background which can leard much of it. Much more reading and study is necessary.It can be helpful to people whose mother tongue is not English (like me).It is something that is better to read than not to read, but for this purpose it is slightly overpriced ..."
3,A timeless classic,This book reminds us how deeply the color complex runs throughout the African American community. Anyone interested in exploring his or her own attitudes about the issue of color prejudice amongst Blacks must read this book.
4,Engrossing and Provocative!,"It is a real shame this book is a ""lost"" classic. The characters in this book are so real I feel I might see them walking down the street.The only flaw I can spot in Thurman's book is an over reliance on exposition. I understand he probably wished to keep the story moving and he had a lot of ground to cover, but this story just screamed for more conversation between the characters. Besides, Thurman, also a playwright, is a master at conversation.If you are reading this, then you obviously have some sort of interest in the theme. If that's true, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I read it over a 24-hour span. I bought it for my fiance, but when I opened the box and read the first few pages, I was hooked. I told my fiance that she would have to wait until I finished it before she could get it. Luckily, it was so engrossing, I finished it the next day."
3,Interesting topic with room for expansion..,I finished the book last night and I am still in a state of confusion. I rarely find myself at a lost for words but I certainly haven't been able to adequately relay my thought on this book. This book opened the issue of racism within the black race but did little to suggest a means to an end. The author does however challenge ones vocabulary muscle. I very much welcome anyone to write me and let me know of there thoughts on this book
1,nothing new here,"Don't waste your money. Not only is as near I can tell 95% or more of video is recycled, its all already on other playboy dvd's. There should be a law against this couragous rip-off. Is there a no-star option?"
2,No difference,I used this for weeks in the middle of summer (the worst time for my oily skin) and could tell no difference in oiliness whatsoever. Disappointed.
5,Shocked and Inspired,"This book completely captivates your attention in the way it exposes the shocking life of women in Muslim lands. What makes this book such a compelling read is the way it tugs at your sense of moral outrage for the attrocities leveled upon women in this land. But just as this feeling solidifies, the act of the central character causes your emotions to turn 180 degrees due to the absolutely spoiled behavior at these same women. As women, they have no rights, but as part of the Saudi Royal family have every material possession imaginable.These competing forces which create a love/hate relationship with the central character (the Sultana)cause you identify with her. For all her childish faults, she is really trying to improve the lot of women in her land.This is a must read, even for men."
1,Absolutely ridiculous,"I read all three of these books. There is not a word of truth in any of these books. They are composed of nothing but gossip and urban legend. Beyond any of the more inflammatory stuff, the description of weddings alone proves that Sasson does not have real first-hand (or, for that matter, second hand) knowledge of what she writes. Any middle-eastern person, or person who has first hand knowledge of middle-eastern weddings (Muslim or Christian) knows exactly what I mean. Incidentally, I am neither an Arab, nor a Muslim and have no reason to be defensive about the topic, though I am much more knowledgeable than Ms. Sasson."
1,nothing new here,"so bad it hurts. a few years ago I thought maybe these guys would amount to something, but it's clear now, they arent' really going anywhere, musically, or in their career. this is some seriously retread stuff here. as generic as it gets. destined for bargain bins everywhere"
1,Technical/quality issues,"I'm sure you know that this classic movie is great. The DVD itself, on the other hand, is not what I've come to expect regarding restoration and remastering and whatnot. Bottom line is, the quality was as bad as the ""bargain bin"" VHS tapes of old movies that I quickly learned to avoid. In particular the sound was badly degraded, with a hiss that made it difficult to understand the dialog towards the beginning (that improved somewhat, but it was still bad). That's particularly annoying because I could clean it up better than that myself, with a trivial application of ""Cool Edit"" shareware! Clearly, this is a direct scan of poor quality original and zero work went into presenting it. The picture, too, is full of flickering spots and the whole thing has a soft out-of-focus look to it. If you just have to have this film in your collection, be resigned to the poor quality. If you're just looking, ask yourself if it's cheap enough for the lousy job."
1,1 Star for this terrible Goodtimes release - don't buy it,"Basically, this is a really bad old print of the film. If anyone reads the reviews on Amazon, make sure you do your homework especially with old films. I've been burned once. Never again."
1,"His Girl Friday, Goodtimes Classics","Terrible copy of an excellent movie. Buyer beware. If it says ""Goodtimes Classics"" it's not worth the money, no matter how cheap."
3,Chris M,"This is on of my favorite Cary Grant movies. I am disappointed with the quality of this video made by ""Goodtimes Classics"". Wish I had read the reviews prior to me puchasing this video. The voices are muffled and with this being such a fast paced movie, it's hard to understand the words. The film is also very grainy. Don't think I will watch this movie very often. If you like this movie, do not purchase the version made by ""Goodtimes Classics"". Spend a little extra money and buy a better version."
4,CHECK IT'S LASERLIGHT BEFORE YOU BUY,"The Laserlight edition of 'His Girl Friday' with the bonusdocumentary 'Cary Grant on Film' is the ONLY edition to buy, and it's less than ... The other DVD edition is virtually unwatchable -- disgusting picture and sound quality. The Laserlight edition has sharp and crisp image and clear sound and though the documentary feature 'Cary Grant on Film' is pretty boring, at least it looks good! SO REMEMBER -- FOR 'HIS GIRL FRIDAY' MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE LASERLIGHT EDITION OR YOU'RE THROWING AWAY YOUR MONEY!"
4,For all Cary Grant fans,"This is Cary Grant at his debonair best. He's sexy, funny, and a smart aleck. Rosalind Russell is hilarious also. A definite must see for old time movie buffs."
1,"BAD DVD, OVERRATED MOVIE","For some reasons I have never been able to get into this film. I find it's madcap antics way too over the top for my taste. Roz Russell and Cary Grant are fine but I have found it impossible to follow the rapid-fire story. Perhaps if we were given a decent DVD transfer, fully restored, I would change my mind. The DVD is so bad its almost unwatchable. This may be the reason I have never been able to get into this movie because the film quality is so poor. This is a film in dire need of restoration because it cannot be fully appreciated. (Just a warning......any time you see a classic film in the bargain bin without the ""Turner"", ""Warner"", ""UNIVERSAL"" or ""20th Century Fox"" trademark, it is a generic DVD and the quality will be poor. A few others like this......""Penny Serenade, Meet John Doe, A Farewell to Arms""), etc."
1,brilliant film--dreadful DVD,"Don't buy this DVD. The sound quality is terrible--a loud hissing noise overshadows the film's trademark fast, witty dialog. $5 seemed a small investment at the time, but I should have saved my money. Surely someday those who own the rights to ""His Girl Friday"" will release a DVD worthy of this wonderful classic."
3,Movie Awesome - DVD not,"I have been waiting to get my copy of ""His Girl Friday"" for sometime, and decided to treat myself. I put it in my DVD player, and the menu comes up...and it won't play. I try resetting, checked the DVD for smudges and there were some, carefully cleaned it, tried again, still wouldn't play. I tried it on my portable DVD player and it works fine, and on my older DVD player that I have in another room. Halfway through the movie, just about the part where the dialouge is getting fast and furious, the dialouge fades out and there is a crackling noise.I love the movie, the barbs between Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant flying fast and furious, Ralph Bellamy just being a good guy and trying to give Hildy what he thinks she wants...Great Stuff! The reproduced DVD, not great.Pay a little more for a better copy."
1,poorly made earrings,the earrings were cheaply made and were not the same size. One was smaller than the other...the earrings were returned.....
2,not the greatest book i've seen,it was informative but i guess maybe '...for dummies' shouldnt necessarily write a book on this since a man is the one writing it - he doesnt really know how a woman feels - not very interactive - just lists the steps - didnt really use it at all
4,AL03 James Arndt,"A very good book on Hitler. It is hard to fantom that an entire nation accepted him as their leader. The Nazi regime should be remembered and history books should teach our future generations how a bunch of evil men took over a nation, and created one of the most elite military dictatorships run by many men who did not believe in God, and how their teachings influenced an entire nation to believe that what they were doing was right, and those men who ran the concentration camps were the most evil men I have ever read about and also how they believed in their minds that what they were doing was right, that is teaching men that killing people in huge pits, who were stripped, and also those sent to the gas chambers, such acts are absolutely insane, and evil. We can only hope that every nation learns from this. A very good book on this terrible time in our history."
3,"Great...looking, at least","Bought this as an alternative the larger brush guards. My spouse recently backed into the front of my truck while parking at only a few MPH and bent my bull bar up against the bumper. I thought, ""great, I have to replace it now, it's bent."" No, no...while the bull bar attaches to the frame with 2 HD bolts on each bracket (4 total), it seems as though the brackets are attached to the inside of the bull bar with a single bolt on each side allowing it to rotate on these bolts and simply fold up. Be warned that if you are looking for a protective push bar, this is not one and does not seem to be built for anything other than looks and holding lights.I give it 3 of 5 stars based solely on style!"
3,Very Good one volume overview of the Commonwealth Enfield SMLE MKI & MkIII and their accessories.,Very Good one volume overview of the Commonwealth Enfield SMLE MKI & MkIII and their accessories.Very Well worth the price..
1,Should NOT be rated G!!,I got this movie for my children because it was rated G. It had numerous curse words in it. I wouldn't recommend it for children. Other than that it was a good movie. But the rated G is very decieving!!
3,Just another 911 book,"For those who wants a brief history about Porsche 911's, this book is for you, however, for those who seek technical data on various models thruout the years, skip this book. Get Brian Long's 911 books. There are way better books out there."
4,Mostly Flawless Collection,"I received this DVD collection. I was amazed that all 12 of the Sniffles cartoons, and all of which make up the first of the two discs in this set, are here. The cartoons that have been de-Blue Ribbonized are ""Little Brother Rat"" and ""Hush My Mouse"" on disc 1, and ""Trap Happy Porky"" and ""The Hypo-Chondri Cat"" on disc 2.And now, my complaints:* The bonus cartoon, Mouse-Warming, should have been restored as the main cartoon for it was directed by Chuck Jones.* The Mouse on 57th Street is another missing Jones short about a mouse.* Among the bonus cartoons that should've made the cut: The Cat Came Back (directed by Friz Freleng), A Sunbonnet Blue (directed by Tex Avery) and Mouse-Placed Kitten (directed by Robert McKimson)Overall, this is a good collection of shorts. Recommended for all those who want to see Sniffles.~Ben"
3,For completists - and lovers of cartoon mice.,"I'm looking forward to this set for one reason(six, actually) and that is we finally get allsix Hubie & Bertie cartoons in one set. Fourof these have been previously released on othersets, but it will be nice to finally get 'HouseHunting Mice' and 'Roughly Squeaking'. Hubie &Bertie were two of my most favorite Chuck Jonescreations, though they were clearly inspired bythe repartee of Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall of theDead End Kids / Bowery Boys pictures. Most ofthe Sniffles cartoons (included here) sufferedfrom an overdose of Disney-inspired cuteness -except for the final two, when they began topattern the character on the 'inquisitive kid'from the old Fibber McGee & Molly radio show.(""Whatcha doin', mister? Huh? What's yer name?"")Sniffles is very funny in these indeed. I'm sureone or titles on the extra disc will make thewhole thing a bit more worthwhile."
1,Waste of Talent!!!!,Perhaps Mr. Snipes talent has diminished. This is the second movie that is totally garbage. The other movie (7 Seconds). Save your money and time. This movie is not worth it!!!!
3,Don't expect too much from this movie,Bought this because of Wesley Snipe... An explosive action-adventure thriller where nothing is what it seems. Don't put too much expection on this but ok to pass time.... 2.5 out 5.
5,The best soft matter introduction,"This is the first book you should read about the subject. An intuitive introduction to the field by one of its masters.Then, you may continue to Chaikin & Lubensky for the heavier,more mathematical formalism. There is no subsequent for this lucid and joyous book.Just buy it!"
5,A nice book,"My advisor strongly recommended this book to me. I asked him if this book is good for my current research. He said no. But he told me that the book's advantage is its clear illustration of physics. I find this point after I finished reading two chapters. Many important points that could be easily ignored (at least for me), e.g., MFT, are commented and discussed. Such discussion benefits me a lot. By the way, my advisor said that this book is nice to be read before sleep. Don't think about it from the negative side, but from the aspect that the whole book is written in a pretty clear way!"
3,"Some good explanations, but a bit polemic","Mr. Keating presents Catholic doctrine well in the second half of the book. However, I was a little bored with the first half in it's exhaustive look at fundamentalist attacks on Catholicism. It's my understanding that well-informed Protestants don't fall for these extremes anymore, although I'm sure there are still some angry anti-Catholics who use the same tired arguments against the church. In this sense, it is a good rebuttal to the outlandish claims against Catholicism, but Mr. Keating is a bit too argumentative and polemic."
4,"A bit dated, but still very very useful","Yes, the book is a bit dated....we don't really refer to ""fundamentalists"" nowadays.But the arguments are the same, no matter which anti-Catholic group we refer to. This is a solid book,and if you really want to know how to support the doctrine of our Church.....read it.Make notes. Actually, you might even think of buying a notebook to organize it as you learn.This was worth every penny."
4,This one's a keeper,"There are many good books out there supporting the Catholic position, just as there are many good books supporting the Fundamentalist positions. Karl Keating has provided a concise and well-researched defense of the Catholic faith, and has more than affirmed my decision of several years ago to choose a spirit of obedience rather than one of rebellion. I gave him only four stars, however, because he writes with an edge and I do not think it necessary. The facts speak for themselves. This book would be an excellent resource for the Catholic wanting to defend his faith or for anyone who wishes to know the biblical evidence for Catholicism."
4,Brilliant movie,"Just as ""Amadeus"" enhanced my appreciation of Mozart's music, ""Bird"" made me a Parker fan for life. The music is a star, and it never sounded better (credit fancy engineering for mixing Parker's original solos with modern recording of a backup band). The disjointedness of the timeline just serves to enhance the perception of the disjointed life of a brilliant but tragically flawed artist. The acting is fantastic, the mood and atmosphere are recreated in amazing fashion.I only wish I had a better feel for Parker's motivation for how he did things. Maybe part of the point is that he was so strongly affected and destroyed by his demons that he really did not have a motivation for how he did what he did."
1,Buyer Cautioned,"From the reviews about this unrated movie, one is to believe that it is a wholesome family movie. Don't be tricked, it is filled with sexual discussions. I only watched a few minutes of the DVD and turned it off. Don't waste your time or money on this trash."
5,Works great,"Works just as expected, mounts easily to Yakima rack. I have 650C wheels and it works fine with that as well."
3,Doesn't fit factory cross bars,"I have a late model Subaru Impreza and I have to buy the Yakima Universal Mighty Mounts (costs $40!!!) in order for this product to fit my car (because my cross bars are sort of oval, neither round nor square). So I don't know how well it works yet."
4,Love it but not perfect for my car...,I got this for my baby to stay occupied on our long trip... Well it fit in front of him (baby rear facing)... But it wouldn't fit on the passenger seat head rest in front of me so I could watch too:(... It kept slipping off... So if you have a Lexus I would try another one but they are nice abs good quality;) I'm gonna keep them for the next car I get!
4,Great case!,"I got this case to hold a 7-in dual screen dvd player system. It has been great! My only wish is that it was slightly roomier, but that's probably just because I like to keep all the accessories with it and it makes it kinda packed tight. It has the capability to be a holder for one of the folding players but I've never used that feature because I just have flat models. It has a pocket for each screen, plus another pocket for accessories like cords, headphones etc. It also has spots to hold a few DVDs too. I would definitely recommend it."
4,"Yes, but....","All the complaints are true. But did my 28-month-old care? No! He wanted to watch it three times a day and enjoyed it every time. His dad and I did wish for some explanation, and older kids might be frustrated. However, pairing this with an EYEWITNESS type book makes the video an ideal interactive opportunity for parent and child: ""What do you think that hose is for?"" ""Look at the way that machine is turning."""
5,Excellent refereence.,"Written by over 70 top musicologists, this splendid reference focuses on composers but also includes a generous selection of performers, theorists, and instrument makers, of all eras and genres, in nearly 6,000 entries.Biographical details are of course provided, with a brief professional resume, (with longer entries for composers of greater significance), an accounting of major works, and a discerning bibliography where appropriate. The authors mention lifestyle issues when they bear heavily on the career of the subject (e.g., Chet Baker's heroin addiction), but the emphasis is on music, as it should be.Coverage runs from Edouard Lalo to Little Richard, Johann Friedrich Fasch to Johnny Rotten, so whatever the musical taste, this dictionary will be useful. Highly recommended for music lovers of all persuasions.(The ""score"" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not ""score"" books.)"
2,"""Oh Georgie, how I long for the old Tull.""","From ""War Child"" onward, Jethro Tull continued and continues to flounder. Here and there intimations of the old inspiration peek through. Here in ""Heavy Horses"" intimations are ""One Brown Mouse"" and ""Moths"". (""Moths"", however, is marred with ponderous and ungainly modulation and passage-work.) The rest is wooden (not sylvan).Recommended: Tulls from ""This Was"" to ""A Passion Play"" and Jeff Burns's ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist""."
5,and the listener never sleeps,"With the opening track ..mouse police.. then followed fast by Acres wild you know something is waiting for you right till the end. A truly concept album from start to finish and not to be missed even for a bathroom break. You will sing the songs, rock the melodies and dance the grooves. Believe me a near perfect album no throwaway. A varied album with folk, hard guitars riffs, prog, Celtic country, rock, funk,symphonic anything this album has it. Some songs give you joy some melancholic. I have 4 cd versions of this album and I keep them all, one at home, on my travel,in the car and in a vault and played each over a hundred times and I still discover new sounds. Do yourself a reward by owning this album. This belongs to the same pastoral rock era of JT with Songs from the Woods and Storm watch and all are highly recommended."
1,Pretentious drivel,Dum-de dah-dee dah dah ...... Totally absent from this heap of mediocrity . As exciting as a slow release of gas under one's seat . And about as meaningful .
1,Peter Pan syndrome,"Let's admit it: ""Stand Up"" is not great music; it's merely great fun. Well, you can't have youthful exuberance forever, but for individuals, there are usually compensations. We get wiser and deeper. We grow. We mature.Not so for rock groups such as the Rolling Stones and Jethro Tull. These lose their youthful exuberance and only gain staleness and sterility, and ""Heavy Horses"" is a particular case in point.(Note that John Lennon found it necessary eventually to dissolve the Beatles, Paul Simon found it necessary eventually to dissolve Simon and Garfunkel, Sting found it necessary eventually to dissolve the Police. It's called ""LIFE"". Deal with it.)"
5,Tull at its best!!!,"This is my all time favorite Jethro Tull album. Every song on this album, from ""the mouse police never sleeps"" to the incredible title track, is spectacular. The lyrics are excellent, the tunes catchy, the vocals good, and all of the instrumentals display incredible virtuosity. If you are a fan of Jethro Tull you owe it to yourself to get this CD. Any fan of folk rock, good guitar, drums, or flute should also consider this purchase."
3,Convenient,"It's nice to have the 3 albums the Everly's made in the 1980s on a 2 disk set.But the xtras (bonus tracks) are very few.The compilers of this set put 2 albums on the first disk, and the 3rd album and one bonus track on the second disk, so it is considererably shorter. And since many think that the 3rd album was not all that great, it makes the second disk on this Hip-O collection rather weak.A convenient package, but primarily for completists"
1,The WORST movie ever,"This was quite possibly the worst movie that has ever been made. It is pure dripple, I saw it in the theatre and EVERYONE walked out within the first hour. STAY FAR AWAY"
4,bad but funny,"I know the movie is bad, but that doesn't it can't stop trying to entertain people. I love the movie because Tom Arnold is just trying to be his best. He's just learning to be a good actor. That's what I forgive him for his bad acting."
4,Sexy but squeeky,These shoes were given to me as a gift. I absolutely love Jessica's style but do find that these shoes squeak quite a bit. I still wear them though.
5,A well-made Spidey figure...,"I got this for the figure and I wasn't disappointed. It is very well articulated and it is a re-issue of the ""Parachute Spidey"" that everyone liked. If you're looking for a nice set, pick a different toy. The background was hard to assemble, and it's hard to imagine a kid easily putting it together. But Spidey is the best feature of the package. He crouches, looks all around, does articulate kicks and poses, and is all around a good figure to have."
1,"This is not Keifer Sutherland's ""Beat""","This movie is not Keifer Sutherland's movie with the same name called ""Beat"". This movie is a Korean movie that was subtitled and I couldn't even get through because I was so dissappointed by getting the wrong movie. It needs to be made clear to the public what they are getting...this movie does not list the cast list. Keifer Sutherland has three movies that are in the can, but are not yet released. Beat is one of these movies about an author who has a homosexual escapade in the sixties? And then accidentally shoots his wife in a William Tell stunt at a party. This is pretty lame as far as a review goes, but had I gotten the right movie, I would have written the right review."
3,Good product for the price,"It's not the best gps out there but if you are looking for something cheaper than $300, this is the one to go for. It is slow starting up, and a couple roads have been out of date but overall it has worked really well! The screen is very colorful and nice, it has lots of features I like (speed limits, directions if you are walking, night time dimmer) It fits in pocket perfectly and I don't feel like I need a bigger screen at all. So if you are willing to be a little patient it's definitely worth the $130."
4,Simply All-in-one for the price,Worth for the cost.Simply superb...I am not a extensive traveller. I bought this just because I tend to get lost in my city. Wanted a safe return to home. It does the trick.Also mostly I use it as my pocket MP3 player.
4,Navigon N100 LOOX,"This is a excellent Product, excellent reception, it give you all the information such as restaurents, gas station, school, Theme Park (Included the name & Logo) etc... , this unit will want you when you drive over the state limit on the freeway, 90% Love this unit, you will enjoy it pretty much.Pro: Lot of information, Portable,Battery last for a long period of times, excellent receptions, easy to find the satelite, easy to use.Con: too much of information but small screen"
2,Only for hardcore fans,"Unless you have been reading faithfully Bernhardt's Justice-series books, this book is *not* worth your money.Although I was very impressed with Naked Justice, this next book is a thorough disappointment. The plot is weak, and the story boring.If not for my initial experience with Naked justice, I would never have even continued reading this book after the first chapter.I'll give it a 2-star for at least a decent attempt at a twist in the story. But that's about it."
2,Silliness Ruins This Story,"I wish I had thought to read my review of Mr. Bernhardt's previous novel, Naked Justice, before I bought this book. I could have saved myself the time it took to read Extreme Justice. As with Naked Justice, the plot is a good one but it is padded with so much silliness (the Christian nudist camp, for example) that it becomes just plain annoying. If Mr. Bernhardt would stop trying to be cute and stick to the serious side of his stories, his books would be greatly improved."
3,"Not bad, but not amazing","Our cat had itchy dry skin and this product helped a little but honestly I did not notice a major improvement. Slightly disappointing, but I probably could have been a little better about giving it to her more frequently."
4,I brought it to save my old tire! Heh Heh,"I brought it to save my old tire. The tire had a punctured on the side of the tire so I use as a inner tube to save my 65,000 miles warranty tire. It works good and I am still driving.... Thank you!"
5,High quality!,"I was pleased with the inner tub, high quality and reliable, I have no complaints!I will buy more in the future! This item is a favorite of mine and my daughter Saber~!"
4,Helpful book on the basics.,Powder Coating made easy is an excellent primer that covers the basics of powder coating. An excellent reference for any one that is beginning in the powder coating business.
4,Seven Alone,"I bought this as a present for a family member and as we sat down to watch Seven Alone, I was thinking, ""OK, another ho-hum, so-so family movie."" Instead, I found myself watching and totally involved in the story. A wonderful family movie!"
1,Utterly Stupid,"You would think that someone who is writing a movie about serial killers and law enforcement agencies would spend some time researching the subject. Obviously, whoever wrote the script for this did not.Anyone with even minor knowledge of police or military tactics would laugh at the antics of the ""red"" team of the movie's fictional government agency, who're supposed to be some sort of elite anti serial-killer organization. If a real officer or operative acted in the manner they did, they'd probably get themselves and their colleagues killed in their first encounter.And what were they thinking casting Cathy Moriarty to play the female agent? She's ugly, and it's a good thing they didn't let her take off her clothes. My deepest sympathy goes out to Patrick Muldoon who had to suffer through two love scenes with that pig. At least they were short."
5,Great little machine screws,"I'm not sure quite what to say about these. They work like any other machine screw, and are made very well. The length was correct. They are all brass (not brass plated) which is a nice plus."
1,Talk about a Bad Concept,"This product would have been better if they would have created their templates built over existing MS Office programs, so that the functionalities inherent to Word/Powerpoint/Excel could be taken advantage of, and so that you could, for example, paste in your concept map as a powerpoint slide, etc.Instead, they created their own little proprietary software which is so limited that it makes it inflexible.In the future, they should just build it over MS office- everyone with a PC or a Mac can use Office. Then Mosby could even sell more copies every time Microsoft came up with a new version of office. I don't see why they are trying to re-invent the wheel.Mosby comes into Nursing classes with their sales force in the beginning and tries to sell us on the idea of their whole Evolve System & resources, some components of the system fall short and don't work together. This is one of those. I don't recommend it."
4,Bought it for the author,Hadn't read a RLS book so bought this one. I enjoyed it. Have not purchased another RLS book yet but may.
3,Kidnapped-O.K. book,"Kidnapped was a o.k. book. I like when he is traveling on the ship and then he gets away from the pirates. I did because I do not think it is right for the kid to get hurt. I did not like when they accused the kid of murder, when he did not do it. I did not because the kid should not get accused for something he did not do. I t would of been beter if they would not kidnapped a kid. They also should not blame the kid for murder when he did not do it. I think you should read this book because it is a O.K. book. I also like how the author puts good words in the book. He dose a very good job of that. He is one of my favorite authors. the book has alot of hard words in it but most of the time you can sound the words out if you try hard anofe."
3,Very Interesting,This book was pretty interesting and I found it hard to read because the author uses weird ways the characters speak. Other than that I found that this book was good and I recommend it to other readers who are looking for a good book to read about adventure.
3,Was not what I expected,Well when the book just started out I did not really like it because it was in anothor type of reading. I was not really used to this type of reading. But further on in the book it got more and more exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat more. But at the end of the book was not all that great because it did not make that much sense to me about what was going on. I would reccommend this book to some one that really liked back in the day books.
1,Waste of money!,"This audio presentation by David Rintoul is extremely dull, boring and bland. It is so uninspiring that my son and I could not finish it. There are lots of excellent audio books out there but this is definitely not one of them. DO NOT BUY IT!"
3,"A very good book at times, bad at others","Most of the time the book ""Kidnapped"" kept me at the edge of my seat. But Especially at the beginning part of the book it had started off very boring. Overrall a rating of 5-6 should be given"
3,Sometimes good and sometimes not goo,"This book has sections that were very interesting, however there were other parts that were not interesting and hard to get through."
2,All Action!,Kidnapped is an awsome book because it's so alive. Almost everything you read is action. It's talks about when David Balfour goes to his fathers friend and finds out that he's his uncle! He gets on a boat and is sold to be killed. When the boat sinks and David is stranded on an island. This book is a favorite of mine because you can't put it down. Since all the action you have to keep reading to see what happends.
3,"Boring at first, then cool",It was a really boring book until the half-way point then got boring again for 2 chapters then th end was cool too. Overall it was okay.
5,"Holiday Recipes, Favorite Traditions and Decoration Tips","To preserve the memories of Christmas past--Berfield style--author, Conni Berfield Hood compiled this variegated collection of holiday recipes, favorite traditions and decoration tips that once captivated the hearts of family members young and old.Seldom to ever use a store bought pattern, the author brought to life many of her own decorating and gift designs in keeping with the sentiment that"" a homemade touch seldom dwindles from the heart and mind of the recipient and maker.""Raised in Gunnison Colorado, Conni earned her first publishing credits during the early 1970's when she wrote frequent features for Women's Household magazine. Since then, numerous other articles appeared in Antique USA; The Fence Post; Mature Living; Creative Crafts and The Beacon."
4,Overall happy,"We got this for my son for his 4th birthday. It is a bit small for him I guess, but he still enjoys it. If I could change one thing about it, I would have the bucket deeper. It seems a bit shallow. But it is a sturdy toy. He will get plenty of enjoyment from it."
1,Very disappointed the item arrived for my grandson's birthday and was defective.,"Item arrived defective, the axel was the incorrect size and the wheel would not fit on the wheelbarrow. This was for my grandson's birthday, I had paid for gift wrapping and it was a huge disappointment. Would not recommend."
1,Hopelessly and uselessly academic,"I was disappointed by this book. It is 100% theory and history of synthesis, written in a typical pedantic British style of writing (sorry, Brits) with 0% actual practical content. It's a mix of a bit of synthesis history with a bit of acoustics describing how these things make sound. But it seems to miss the point, and one could learn more just by playing a synthesiser for an hour than learning this book from cover to cover. If you're investingating this book with an eye towards learning how to program synths or better understand them, I think you'll be disappointed. It spends a lot of time discussing the pioneers (DX7, etc.) but doesn't even mention some of the most important synths of the day (Waldorf, Virus) and there's only a brief mention of softwaresynths (Reaktor, Reason) and none of softsamplers (Unity, Giga, etc.)) I think this book misses the mark; it fills your head with facts and figures but doesn't give you much that's actually useful. Sorry fellas."
2,A rather boring translation of the great Dreigroschenoper,"One has to know and understand the original German text of the Dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the English translations. This one, used among others by Helen Schneider on her album with Weill songs, has nothing of the sarcasms of the German lyrics. Better read the 1954 translation of Marc Blitzstein or the translation made by Frank McGuinness in the early 1990s."
5,Small Comment,"The book is a treasure, and I take pleasure in the fact that two others have enjoyed it. In truth we had dinner at the restaurant and I just wanted a souvenir. I have referred to it many times since them. I really use the recipes out of Brunetti's cookbook more, but this one has the memories."
3,Cute but Doesn't Work Well,"Kirara's iron on patch was adorable and so cute, but the problem was it says Iron on but it doesn't iron on. It is so easy to rip and so hard to get to stick you have to get a needle and thread."
2,Unpleasant,"I don't know, maybe I'm getting too old for this kind of thing. Perhaps there are some good ideas here, but it's full of cliches. Every male character is a brutal soldier, and the main female character is the standard ""hooker with a heart of gold."" Overall the whole thing just feels so misanthropic I couldn't really find a way to enjoy it."
3,Methinks the slave matriculated unto Oxford or Cambridge,"Mr. Johnson can definitely string words together with punch and verve -- no question.But while I relish the opportunity to surrender logic and suspend disbelief while reading a work of fiction, I cannot do so when the narrator or protagonist lacks authenticity or credibility.The spectre of slaves who speak not like the common man, but rather like PhD candidates in English literature, weighs heavily upon this work. As it turns out, this apple of incredulity is bad enough to spoil the entire barrel.Final verdict? Great prose, poor design."
1,annoying voice of Dexter Gordon.,"Dexter Gordon's voice is terrible to hear all allong this movie. The French actor plays a stupid fanatic who forgets he has a life. This whole story might be true but the voice is terrible and the rythm of the movie is sloooow. I bought this movie because of your review but after I had seen it I returned it to the store to exchanged it. Compare this movie to Bird or Mo better blues and you will give those two movies a 10. With all due respect to Dexter Gordon's musical genius, Tavernier should have chosen an actor with a better voice. Typical french movies, they throw things at you that you must like because it is supposed to be deep and intellectual. Wrong. as Serge Dassault inventor of the Mirage jet fighter once said: "" a plane can be technically the best, but without beauty it isn't a plane."
1,Big disappointment,"No real ""meat"" here, just fluff, once he gets past the 5 minute explanation of how guys are waffles, girls are spaghetti. A waste of time...."
4,The recipes in here won't let you down,"It's not the greatest, simply because it's outdated. But it has two things going for it:I feel confident, that when I'm headed to a potluck on short notice, I will always be able to find someting adequate in this book. What do I mean by ""adequate""? A dish that I can make quickly, with easy-to-find ingredients (probably already in my frig or on my shelves); a dish that transports easily; and a dish that won't embarass me, and an empty dish at the end of the day.Secondly, I collect old cookbooks and old recipes. This book contains quite a few old-time recipes that I've not run into before."
3,I felt that this product was a good ...,I felt that this product was a good alternative for nutrition on the go. It would be nice to eat a fast bar when you're rushing out the door rather than skip an entire meal. The taste was acceptable. It wasn't like eating a candy bar but it wasn't terrible either. I haven't tried other nutritional bars so I really don't have anything to compare these to. I did feel that this was an interesting product and it definitely has its place in today's fast-paced world.
2,I would have to say I was not ...,"I would have to say I was not very impressed by the quality and taste of this product. I guess I really expected more from this product, as they seem so expensive. The peanut-butter taste was very strong and the texture was very grainy and dry. I don't think that these bars are very filling. You have to drink a lot of water with them to even get them down. I would not recommend this product to my friends."
5,Balance Bar - Chocolate Raspberry Fudge,"These were the first energy bars I tried and always come back to them after trying others.My staples are honey peanut and gold caramel nut blast but also love chocolate raspberry fudge, it's sort of like chocolate mousse in bar form without the guilt.It's just good."
1,I'm sorry to say that I wasn't impressed ...,"I'm sorry to say that I wasn't impressed with Balance Bar 40-30-30. Quite frankly, it tasted horrible! I couldn't finish the first bar to see if it satisfied my hunger or sustained my energy. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends."
4,Mostly satisfied!,"I love these Balance Bars. The honey yogurt peanut flavor is the best I've tried, and they are great with a glass of cold, skim milk for breakfast or a snack. Without the milk, they aren't very filling, it's true, but they are still very tasty and better for you than candy. However, it's also true that since they are made with HFCS they aren't as healthy as some of the other bars available. They probably have a fairly high glycemic index.Still, if that's not an issue for you, and you want to soothe a sweet tooth, or find a fairly healthy fast breakfast or snack for on the go, give 'em a try. Btw, some people have complained about the price - here in NYC they go for nearly $2 per bar, making Amazon's prices amazing!"
1,They've REDONE them...and it's not good,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars. They were terrific. But, they put them in new packaging (fine, who cares, right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them. They're sickly sweet now, they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a ""chip"" in sight.It's all bad. I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast. No more. The new ones are so bad, I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
3,The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was ...,"The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was not the best tasting product out there on the market today. It was heavy and somewhat filling, but very thick, dense, and tasted bland. It really left something to be desired. It was chewy like a brownie and it sort of resembled a brownie, but upon biting into the bar, you just know it's not a brownie. After the first bite, it was kind of hard to eat. It reminded me of these terrible diet cookies that tasted as though they were filled with sawdust. It really needs more taste. Overall, I rated the brownie bar as three stars because I suppose that taste versus nutrition is a tradeoff."
3,Not for children,"It is too delicate for little boys to play with. It is difficult for an adult to learn, how in the world can they recommend it for a ten year old? I still haven't managed to get it to stay in the air for more than five seconds. Very, very fast on the ground though. I think it would be very fun if it was easier to get off the ground and easier to learn to fly. Over all, I have to say that Air Hogs needs to do some tweaking on this toy, though it has a lot of potential."
2,Storm Launcher Review,"I am very disappointed in the construction of this toy. The picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material. It was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it's made of. I have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next Christmas. I would have sent it back if it had not been from ""Santa""."
2,disappointing,"I'd heard only good things about this book, so being a pkd fan, I expected an intriguing read. Not so. The dialogue at points is clunky and unnatural, and sometimes the character's motives are not believable (for example, Charley wanting to kill his wife; Jack's amusing but unjustified creating a ""story"" for Charley). Despite the fact that some of this is drawn from the author's life (faye is based on one of his real-life wives), it feels like he doesn't really know these characters. They serve the plot rather than vice versa. Also pkd's strengths -- his humor and elaborate imagination -- are tied up.Knopf requested a rewrite for this novel circa 1960 and sadly the author never revised it, despite not finding a publisher for it until 1975. Oh well, I suppose I'll have to pick up ""three stigmata"" or ""dr bloodmoney"" for my pkd fix."
4,Some of the,"A nice collection of obscure 80s dance material.A minor disclaimer: despite ""Italo Disco"" in the title some songs sound more like Eurodisco or NRG. E.g., tracks 1 (by Fresh Color), 3 (by Private Moves) and 7 (by Sharon). Not there's anything wrong with that - before you know it, you will probably find yourself humming ""Sing With Me Tonight"" for several days :).The lightly melancholic track 1 and the Gazebo-esque ""Don't Stop Loving Me"" (by Robertson Humphrey) were instant winners with me. And then you got the irrepressible ""Jungleman"" (by Veronique), done in the best German Italo tradition, reminiscent of Lian Ross.The sound quality is excellent. My only complaint is that half the songs are under 4 minutes.If you think you've heard all the Italo the 80s had to offer and getting bored with your collection, you may find this compilation a breath of fresh air."
4,Entertaining,"I bought this movie because I like Catherine Bell (Good Witch) a lot. I'm not a huge fan of pretty-boy Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers), yet I liked his character in this movie. I love science fiction, and I would rate this as science fiction ""lite"". The time travel story was familiar, yet all in all, it was entertaining with strong action and a bit of a twist. I think this movie had another title at one time because I also find it listed as ""Time Shifters"" in some websites. Like most time-travel stories, time paradox is responsible for much of the story's conflict. The old idea ""if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, how were you ever born to be able to go back in time to kill him?"" My one gripe (with all time travel movies) is that when the paradox occurs, why are some people aware of it and not others? It doesn't make sense that one could remember more than one time line. Oh well, time travel is always confusing.Thrill Seekers"
3,Turn Back To Johnny,"Johnny Hates Jazz produced one classic hit with their 1988 song ""Shattered Dreams"". It's a brilliant little piece of 80's pop with its snappy synth line and sing along chorus. The song soared all the way to number 2 on the charts. Sadly nothing else on the album matches the greatness of that song. ""I Don't Want To Be A Hero"" has a Culture Club vibe and scrapped into the bottom of the top 40 at number 31. The title track is a marginal r&b influenced track and ""Don't Let It End This Way"" is a more moody track."
4,One of Argento's best,"I personally think this film is underrated, compared to all the praise Argento's Suspiria receives. That's also a great film, but Tenebrae is often overlooked. The story is about a horror novelist who travels to Italy to promote his new book, called Tenebrae. Soon, some murders start happening that link the author to the crimes. The usual giallo business, yes, but this film is different. It contains some of the most powerful scenes Argento has ever filmed. Not to mention a huge body count. About 20 minutes into the film there's a very haunting flashback that gives me chills every time I see it. It's a beautiful scene. Some other highlights include the infamous (and very gory) arm-chopping and the extremly tense scene of a girl being chased by a vicious dog. Some parts are silly, and the ending is a bit confusing, but I still consider this a classic, and one you shouldn't miss."
4,Return To The Moon---Yes!,"The enthusiasm that Jack Schmitt displays in a live presentation is missing from this work, but if you want a thoroughly researched proposal to justify on a financial and societal basis a return to the Moon, then this book is perfect for your needs. If you want to find a convincing reason for going back to the Moon to stay, but are not as interested in all the expenditure/benefit analyses, you can skip over much of the fine points. In either case, Dr. Schmitt builds his case on one grand assumption, a reasonable one, that in due time fusion technology will supplant our present energy production methods, and lunar resources can provide precious fuels needed for fusion plants, and along the way a lot of other interesting geological and astronomical science can be performed as a permanent human presence on the Moon is set up."
1,Paperback missing content,I purchased the Kindle edition of this book and decided to buy a paperback copy because the book has various charts that are important to the content. The charts on the Kindle version are scanned at a low resolution so it is nearly impossible to make out the text once the pictures are enlarged. I went ahead and ordered the paperback copy so I could see the charts clearly only find out that this book is missing them. It has a few of the illustrations that the Kindle edition has but it is missing ALL of the charts. If you want a complete edition of this book skip the paperback.
4,A Good Book,"This book was very good, although it was not the best out of the three in the series. Victoria and Rafael are hilarious when it comes their fighting, although it's the same with all of Coulter's books. She's my favorite author, and I've come to love all of her writings. I must say that the book does leave some loose ends at the end, but it ties some of the ends from Calypso Magic, like why Rafael Carstairs was not just any sea captain. The last chapter is hystericaly funny when they bring in the three couples, Rafael and Victoria, Hawk and Frances, and Diana and. I loved how Hawk and Frances Keep appearing in all three books, although Diana and don't appear in the last one untill the last chapter."
5,Statler Brothers Christmas Card,We had this on casssette years ago and completely wore it out. My Mom will be so surprised I found this on CD for her. We absolutely love it!!
5,Very Happy,"Excellent quality used CD, arrived quickly, no issues, have looked for this CD for many years, was glad to find it."
5,A vivid and stirring account of salvation,Life After Life is a vivid and stirring account of salvation that comes to a brilliant young man whose early years in a middle class southern family were marred by his criminal acts brought on by his deep yearning to correct racial injustice in his Virginia hometown.Reading Life After Life gives a chilling view of prison existence that both alerts and alarms. The author's eloquent description of his family's devoted care and many years of sacrifices during his years of inprisonment is a major highlight of this appealing narrative. This is a compelling story that makes for real reading pleasure.
3,"36 review of this CD (i think, ofrgot what was on previous e","Well, I wont go through each of the songs because Im sure someone else did already. I bought this before seeing the movie, if that holds any significance.Your best bet, hoewver, is to buy the CD's by the specific artists if you want that song because not all of them are worth the price. (if if you can't, dowload them).My favourites were by Lacuna Coil, Cradle of Filth, A Perfect Circle, the Cure, and Devil Driver but it's really a matter of personaly opinion. Most of the songs can be found on the artist's CDs.hmm... Did that make much sense at all?"
3,Good but not Great,"This is a very good album as far as soundtracks go,But it could have done without Rammstein or Rammstink as i call them.Best song by far has to be Cradle of Filths-Nymphetamine which has the spectacular vocal help of Ex-Theatre of Tragedy vocalist and Now Leaves Eyes vocalist Liv Kristine. I Bought the CD specifically for that song alone even though i just ordered the Nymphetamine CD..HIM does a great job along with a few others but they could have left off Slipknot and Rammstein...2 of the worse bands ever"
1,Music to sell not from the heart,"All there's to be said about this soundtrack is ? Music to sell and not from the heart... Mainstream crap like devilrider,slipknot,killswitch engage and the list goes on and on. Plain crap and if you love real metal don't even waste your money on this poison kids call music! Any one can see that who chose this sountrack did it so others can buy it not because they love the music, its so fake and bunch of bullsh*t! I like to see them putting deicide or cannibal corpse or cryptopsy is those soundtracks... No ? That's because mainstream so called "" real"" metal but posers can't take real brutality and heavyness with techinality thrown together. Keep your (...) false metal--I'll stick to my real extreme music...Thank you very much!"
4,Just Right and Lots of Fun!,"Easy, yet stimulating. Great to look at. Good background, catchy music, just right aerobics."
3,"Good Family Viewing, Poor Movie.","It has great value as a family-friendly movie. Otherwise, neither the storyline, nor the production are worth mentioning."
4,Pylepro PDBT78 Supertweeter,"For my application ,Works Great !!!I just bought 2 of these for the price of one on Ebay to use with a Selenium 250W 8"" Full range P.A. driver rated 92 db/1W 1M. A 4""x10"" Horntweeter I was going to use just over powered the woofer. The only adjustment I made was to use a 6 uF cap instead of the 3.3 uF cap that comes with the tweeter which lowers the cross over frequency point."
4,Good can opener,"Works fine - my only complaint is that I need to use a different one when opening something I need to drain, like tuna."
2,"Well Done for an 80's horror film, but doesn't go anywhere!","This was a neat film at the start with great music scores by Motley Crue, Billy Idol, Accept with other 80's groups, but most of this film takes place in a movie theatre as demons possess people in the movie theatre as well as on screen. Watching it once is okay, but not for a second time. Frightening stuff though."
2,Completely overrated hack-job,"I'm a big fan of the Italian scene, and this movie disappointed me A LOT after all the hype I'd heard. Not only is this movie poorly paced and BORING as hell, but the music was poorly concieved and does not fit in at all with the subject matter. Contrary to what everyone says, Demons is rather light on gore and what gore there is is so badly done that it really doesnt even count. The plot was moronic as were about 90% of the casting decisions. Lamberto Bava's only decent efforts I've seen are Blastfighter and Blade in the Dark. Other than that, he's just a hack. A pale imitation of the great man his father was. Bobby Rhodes was cool in this movie though, so I give it stars for that. For the true Italian horror experience, see one of the classics like ""The Beyond"", ""The House by the Cemetery"", ""The New York Ripper"", ""Zombie"", or ""Surpiria"". Try and steer clear of this garbage."
2,AM I BLIND??,"This game would be fun IF you could SEE it! You have to play this practically in the dark to see it. It is lit so lightly that in daylight, (like in the car) you can barely see what you are doing. NEW BATTERIES TOO! Otherwise it can be fun, but it is hard to get past the first level, because you cannot see where you are going."
2,GLITTER MOCK,"WHAM, BAM, THANK-YOU GLAM!-VARIOUS ARTISTS: A nifty title for that rompin' stompin' dumb-fun 70s phenom known as glitter rock...but this disc hardly justifies the era, spotlighting many acts connected by only the thinnest of threads. Any glam-fest should at least give due to two of its grandest practitioners, Brit bands Slade and Sweet; even David Bowie, whose SUFFRAGETTE CITY this disc nicks its very name from, is nowhere to be heard here (his services don't come cheap). Gary Glitters' primitive arena thumper ROCK AND ROLL PART 2 (the ""HEY"" song to you sports fans) is possibly the only artist here that fits the category well. Iggy Pop, ex- New York Dolls screecher David Johansen, and Patti Smith are punk rock pioneers, while Kiss, Starz, and Edgar Winter represent garden variety hard rock. That leaves Blondie (new wave), one hit wonder David Essex (HUH?????), and the exquisitely uncatergorizable Mott the Hoople. So...Wham, Bam, Where's the GLAM?RATING: TWO PLATFORM BOOTS"
4,Good fire resistance advice,"There is a good section on planting a fire-resistant landscape.The book is geared to the Rocky Mountain area, but there is some information pertinent to Southern California (another planet, as far as most gardening books are concerned). I also found the 'plant substitution' guide to be very useful."
2,Autumn in New York DVD,"Item was faulty, but the seller responded immediately to the problem and resolved it beyond my satisfaction. I highly recommend this seller for you will be satisfactorily taken care of if there are any issues to resolve. The item wasn't 5-star, but I give the seller 5 stars PLUS!"
1,By-The-Numbers Load of Blech!,"This movie is nothing but a cliched creepfest whose laughable storyline consists of Richard Gere pining after some young girl. If the plot doesn't creep the heck out of you, the movie itself will lull you to sleep. Avoid this DVD like the plague!"
2,"Eye Candy, All Around","Richard Gere, Winona Ryder and New York City all look great in this predictable and somewhat unrealistic movie. The restaurants, apartments and background locations are beautiful and enjoyable to see. However, Gere gives another uninspiring performance; Winona Ryder is a breath of fresh air but not enough to carry the entire movie. Watch it for the great scenes of New York in the fall."
2,What went wrong?,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be an all time favorite, boy was I wrong. It had no realistic plot and it was to predictable. Gere was a jerk, and Ryder was an immature 22 yr. old (for having gone through so much... losing parents, being diagnosed with a tumor...)-- I hope I don't act that childish around my elders."
1,Awww Dumb In New York,"I'm not a terrible person by giving this one star. Too bad the story regarding poor young girls with heart defects that end up badly is only a story, and an immature one at best. I thought the story was simply ridiculous. I'm supposed to feel badly for poor, stupid Richard Gere, who cheats on this fine young thing because he didn't know what else to do. I have no sympathy for this guy who finally finds true love (still he cheats) and is left broken hearted. Also I find her very weak in taking him back, as if he's the catch of the world. He didn't even have to true very hard in order to win her back either. I don't feel bad for him because he is nearly 50 and shanking a 22 year old with a heart defect. NO!I also found stupid the fact that they go on one date and are professing their love toward each other. This movie appears to be geared to teenagers as well as written by one also.Last fact---her hats her ridiculous also and once they met didn't he have to work again----ever."
3,"""Not So Beautiful Experience"".","Having bought the CD album ""New Power Generation""in 1990, I was impressed with the various versions of the song ""New Power Generation"". The song is from the album, ""Graffiti Bridge"". I had high expectation for this CD, so I'm very disappointed with this Prince's offering. Versions of ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World"" are not exciting, except the last one, they are weak & uninspiring. Prince is generally regarded as the one of the best musician around & known for his prolific writing and versatility, but in this release none of these show. Sadly that the album could have been improved/bolstered by simply adding (1) the single version and (2) the album version of ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World"". I didn't experience any beautiful experience listening to this album except for the closing version, which was great!"
2,one piece of the puzzle,"I read this book several times and i think it's worth reading for any investor. there are some aspects of investing that are not covered very will. money management, and taking the short side of the market. it mostly covers the timing and psychology of entering the markets from a long position. ie; buying the stocks outright. it doesn't do any justice to several other ways to ""investolate"" in the markets. for a strategy on being long the market, i think it is one of the best books out there... but not because of the technical analysis.(there is no ground breaking info there) the market psychology is what is worth reading about."
1,Overpriced Hogwash,"The absurd amount of money that would be spent to buy the publication is much better invested in a something that teaches the fundamentals of investing which have moved this economy to where it is today. This book encourages the purchase of securities with low equity and very poor earnings that are ready to go broke. A better market investment would be towards stocks which have a proven track record and will actually MAKE MONEY, rather then turning them into declared losses. (Prof. of Economics)"
4,Ponies Gone Wild!,"I have daughters aged 4 and 7 and they both love this book. As other reviewers have noted, some of the ponies have long, unfamiliar, and hard to read/pronounce names, such as Serendipity, but my 7-year-old just says ""bla bla"" if it's too hard to work out! Initially, my daughters both complained that some ponies they knew from the TV series looked different, because the Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy in these stories have no wings. But they got over that and really love the stories. Naturally it's very girly and silly, but the characters are kind and good friends to one another. Works for us!"
5,My daughter's two favorite topics together at last,"My daughter got this book for Christmas and we have read it at least 50 times, so we are very happy with this book!"
3,disappointed,"these are very well made and are a beautiful color pink, but the ankles are way too small for my baby. her little foot fits fine, but the hook-and-loop closure on the ankle doesn't adequately reach around her chubby little ankles. i don't think she is unusually large. the doctor said she's 30th percentile in weight and height. they might work better with an older child that doesn't have baby-ish ankles. i sure wish they worked because they look great and are of great quality."
4,The Bible: Eden A Review,"Visually stunning, and with text taken straight from the Bible, this book is an amazing read. However, with that said, The Bible: Eden is not a book for everyone. It relies a bit too heavily on the nudity, sexuality, and ""intimacy"" between Adam & Eve at times. If you are easily offended by such content, it would be best to steer clear from this collection. On the other hand, these instances are presented in such an honest, innocent, and realistic approach, that the content does not seem pornographic.We get to see the creation, innocence, seduction, and fall of Adam & Even live and in color in the photo-realistic paintings provided in this collection. I would definately recommend to anyone, just bring an open mind to this interpretation of this classic Bible tale."
5,beautiful!,"This is the second time I buy this book - it's simple yet very informative, great illustrations and clear for people who have no previous knowledge of chakras"
2,This book sucks,"Seriously, it does. It's easy to like it at first when it's your first book on chakras & yoga. You see that there is some good information in here and the charts in the back are pretty nifty. However, when you realize that you could have spent the same money from this glossy book which kind of goes over the basics & brings up a lot of stuff you might not care about and bought a used complete yoga manual (like Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha for example) that actually is jam packed with information then you'll probably do just that. The postures in this book are very basic and most of the information here is broken down in just a couple of pages in the book I recommended above. Anything that's left out, like stuff regarding spices, isn't too hard to find on the internet.Now it's not a TERRIBLE thing to have and it kept me occupied for awhile but when you realize you can go way further in the same practice for the same amount of money, why bother?"
5,It works,"The filter does what it is made to do. You can even stretch the life of these by replacing the charcoal instead of replacing the entire filter. But eventually, you do need a replacement."
3,"not the best, certainly not the worst, but duly entertaining","I've been working my way through the Hercule Poirot books (in publication order), and one element that I appreciate is that Christie avoids a formulaic set-up. Sometimes Poirot is accompanied by his friend Hastings (Mysterious Affair at Styles), sometimes by a local person (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd), sometimes he solves the case from his armchair (one of the stories inPoirot Investigates), and sometimes he acts like 007 (the not-very-goodThe Big Four).In this novel, Poirot doesn't appear until the second third of the book. The first third lays out a variety of distinctive storylines that only come together on the titular Blue Train. Something bad happens. Poirot brings his A game. Red herrings abound. A great travel read. (I read it on a trip to Brazil: it got me through five days.)Note on potentially offensive content: Murder as entertainment and vanity."
4,"Agatha never liked this one, but the rest of us do!","Agatha, in her autobiography, said she never knew why people liked this book.It was a charming adventure--great for Agatha fans."
2,Christie did a much better job on The Orient Express,"An heiress murdered, her newly acquired rubies stolen, a lover, estranged husband & mistress, a young girl who has inherited money and Poirot all get entangled in the affair; it's a mess. MURDER ON THE BLUE TRAIN plods along at a snail's pace and it is actually a pleasure to reach the end. The murder victim doesn't earn our compassion or contempt, the side trips into the life of our newly moneyed young heroine are tedious and Poirot muddles through without his usual aplomb. Even when the killer is revealed, it lacks the usual drama of Poirot's theatrics; it's almost an afterthought. Christie does a much better job when she puts Poirot on the Orient Express."
2,Ever felt you didn't care who the murderer was?,"Yes, thats exactly how I felt after going thru 25 chapters of this book. As some other reviewer mentioned, Christie seems to have stretched out a little murder mystery into a full-blown novel. Probably the best thing Christie does with this novel is that she reveals the murderer at a point when you are in a quandary as to read on or not. Just too much to read to get to a mediocre ending. I've read 3 Christie books now and this is easily the worst."
2,Not one of her greatest,"I have to admit, this one left me a bit confused and uninspired. The final whereabouts of the Heart Afire ruby were a bit vague and I'm not sure how it ended up with who it did, plus the identity of the murderer is easy to guess, as well. In this one in particular, Poirot seems grumpy and pushy and in some passages, downright surly and rude. I didn't find this to be one of his more riveting cases. Murder on the Orient Express uses the train setting much more cleverly and even Miss Marple's 4:15 from Paddington was more involving. This, I hate to say, because I love everything Christie writes, came off rather flat. The characters aren't really interesting, either"
3,second time,Read this once a long time ago. Still a good read Would r ecommend to Christie fans as well as new readers
1,Short Life + Poor Performance = Bad Value,"I bought this as a desktop PC backup.A year after installing it, power went off one day when I was at my PC. I thought I would have at least 10 minutes of backup based on my PC and monitor wattage, but the UPS gave out in about two minutes, before I had finished up and shut down. Useless.Then, 4 months after the warranty expired, the beeper sounded constantly, and the power led flashed, indicating the battery was in need of replacement.The bottom line - Spent $70 for a UPS that never did its job the one time I needed it and failed just after two years. No more APC UPS for me..."
2,A real let down..,"I've you enjoyed the book you will not like this series. I was so dissapointed when I missed this series when it first ran on the Sci-Fi channel, but now I regret paying for this DVD. The original film, while cryptic, followed the original story line much better. Wooden acting and poor character portrayal (Paul is a whiney spoiled brat) make this hard to watch."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Some may not have liked the origal Dune movie, but it was worlds better than the mini-series. I quit watching after the first episode because the script, acting, and costumes were atrocious. This is the age of CGI like the Matrix and Toy Story 2, yet the Dune mini-series didn't even have half the quality of special effects needed to save it.My disappointment about the original Dune movie was that not enough of the Dune world was able to fit in the it. I wanted more. The costume and set designers of the movie were able to put on screen what I could not muster from my imagination with my best attempt. I must admit I started to watch the mini-series with very high expectations, but the show was barely watchable."
2,Wait for the director's cut,"This release is a bit disappointing on a few counts. Despite the claims on the 'Technical Info' page that this DVD is anamorphic, it is not. Also, the audio hasn't been remixed to be 5.1 surround; it's only Dolby 2.0. Finally, the disc is lacking extra footage that was cut from the US TV version of the mini-series to accomodate commercial breaks, rumored to be about 20 minutes of additional material.Supposedly, this ""Director's Cut"" version of the Dune mini-series is owned by a German company who wanted quite a bit of money for its' use in the U.S. According to the series' production company, New Amsterdam Entertainment, it is quite likely that a ""Collectors Edition"" of Dune will be released at some point in the future with the longer version of the series and a 5.1 soundtrack. I don't want to buy the same disc twice; I'll wait for the Collector's Edition."
1,Yawwwwwn...,"First, I must mention that I simply love Dune - as it was originally written. Though many have scoffed at the David Lynch film, after seing this TV version - I must now say that the Lynch version is brilliant and superior. This newest attempt is so bad, and so boring. The casting is terrible. I cannot imagine worse casting. Paul is a whiney, immature, wanna be Mark Hamill from the original Star Wars... The viewer cannot avoid developing a hatred for him. In fact, one cannot even develop any interest for any character in the film. William Hurt, although a fine actor, is terribly cast as Duke Leto. Weak. Paul's mother is a Hillary CLinton look alike. Avoid this waste.."
1,total stinker,How about some acting. Looks like they spent the entire budget on stupid costumes. Don't waste your time on this one.
4,Watch with a sequel,"This miniseries is not perfect. It moves a little slower than the previous movie version, and is on a completely different level- costume/set/effects-wise is a completely different vision.The best part of this miniseries is that ""Children of Dune"" was made and so you see more of the story unfold, with the same actors and professionalism. I wish ""God Emporer of Dune"" were made, it really completes the story.So watching this series and Children of Dune is definitely a must for any fan of Herbert's!!"
3,Frank Herbert's Dune Director's Cut,"Great service, but disappointed in the quality of the used disc because the first disc does not play and I wish I would have bought it new instead of used. I may have to buy it again so I can watch the movie in full."
1,"Stunk, read the book instead","After struggling to watch the first three hours I couldn't find the strength in me to finish off the last hour and a half. Although it followed the story line pretty well it didn't seem to really connect well (for example Paul had no real transition from a 15 year old kid to Muad'dib--just happened) This was a very poor adaptation of Herbert's masterpiece, read the book and you will know what I mean. This seemed more like an after-school special effort than an epic sci-fi movie. I was also disappointed with enormous amounts of ""skin"" that they put into the movie.David Lynch's 1984 version (although quite strange like all David Lynch movies) was much better. There were great acting performances in Lynch's version. This version seemed over-acted and half-hearted all at the same time"
1,Frank Herbert's Dune (TV Mini-Series),"It is amazing that the Sci-Fi channel could produce such slop. Why not do a remake of ""attack of the killer tomatoes""; it would probably be just as interesting as Dune the mini series. Bad actors throughout the movie at one point I had to turn it off because it was so painful. For those of you who are Dune fans please do not watch, you will be deeply offended by this filth. If I could give this dire film zero stars I would."
2,Think Again,"The TV Miniseries takes six hours to play out what the Peter Lynch version does in two hours. The main differences:Peter Lynch VersionWeirding Modules - Not in the bookFolding Space - Not in the book4 Hours shorter than TV MiniseriesCostumes and sets are awesome and character appropriate.Paul seems regal and a leader.Special effects are very good.TV MiniseriesPaul and Chani's child die - In the book, not in Peter Lynch VersionCharacter-building of Liet - In the book, not in Peter Lynch Version4 Hours longer than Peter Lynch VersionCostumes and sets are pathetic. Imperial and Harkonmen characters look like ""duded-up girly men with a bad fashion sense"". Fremen look as if the wardrobe department bought the stillsuits at a local Army/Navy Surplus store.Paul is never referred to as Usul.Mentats are never mentioned.Paul seems a spoiled manipulative brat with no leadership abilites.Special effects are very bad."
1,UGH!,"I bought this DVD in mid June, 2001 primarily because I missed the MINI SERIES when it showed on TV. Before I received it, I was able to see it on a neighbor's system. Watching this version was somewhat of a LET-DOWN. It is NOT even close QUALITY WISE [acting, video or audio effects], to the 1984 version. When my copy arrived from AMAZON, I unwrapped it and filed it away for viewing on a rainy day. [At the time I had about 1000 DVDs in my collection. Now I have more] About 6 months later, I pulled it out to watch on my JVC DVD changer. It skipped so much that I STOPPED my DVD player and put it back in my collection and grabbed something else to watch. As of JANUARY 2006, this is the only DVD that WON'T play on my system. This DVD deserves a [0] star rating."
1,"horrid acting, sets, costumes, plot, etc.","What a hack job. The plot was way different than the books, in a bad way. My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish watching it we were so disgusted."
4,"Longer, more in depth","First off, I must say I have only Dune of the Dune books. My first impression of Dune was the movie from the 80s, which did not greatly impress me with anything other than the cast itself. This version is longer than the other movie, and is much more enjoyable. A mini-series always allows more to be done with something than a feature film because of the obvious time constraints. People will watch something on TV 3 nights in a row for 2 hours, but will NOT sit through a dark theater for 6 hours. This added time allows the story to develop more. I cannot compare this to the books, but it is very enjoyable to watch. Good story, which I imagine is why the Dune series enjoys legend status in the realm of Sci-Fi, great special effects, and solid acting by the cast."
5,Delightfully faithful and entertaining adaptation.,"To be honest, I never really had much desire to watch this miniseries. The story's great, no doubt about that, but David Lynch's movie was a stinker, and I was pretty certain after that that any attempt to adapt the novel once more would also fail. Well, after looking at the very cool box art (on the VHS version), I decided to finally give it a chance. Next thing I knew, I found myself immersed in another universe and alternate reality that was convincing and engrossing. As an adventure movie, Dune features lots of tension and plenty of good action. As a political film, it features treachery and much planning. As science fiction, it creates an entirely believable reality and captures the imagination. Yes, at 265 minutes it will definitely test some people's patience, but if you do enjoy a movie that is centered around its story and characters, you will find this miniseries a joy to watch."
3,Keeps things cold but already rusting!,"**Good points:-Free shipping & no sales tax if you are Amazon Prime, saves nearly $100 (#1 reason I chose this item)-Keeps items cool for a long time-Functional, rollers work well, you can lift one side without opening the other, bottle opener built in w/catch to for the lids & drain in the back to let water out-Interior cleans well & retards smell of stagnant cooler water-Easy to asemble**Reasons it did not get 5 stars:-Upon receipt there was a 2 inch long deep scratch/indentation on the front center of cooler-This item has already started to rust in less than one year, which is a big deal since I live in San Diego the most temperament climate in the country, no rain, no snow, no heavy wind etc, I would be worried about this if I lived in a more rainy/harsh outdoor climateAll in all for the money you save w/ no cost shipping or tax its worth it"
5,Great for autistic kids,"My kids loved this DVD! Really kept their interest, my 2 autistic boys love it, they're always wanting to watch it!"
2,Oxidized color and comes off on your finger.,"They sent me the wrong length, 1-1/4 instead of 1-1/8. Not a big deal, I can still use it. But unlike another size I got from them which was nice and golden yellow, these were oxidized dull dark yellow color like the pic. The stuff also comes off on your finger and you can smell it.Go for the golden color brass. Much nicer looking and doesn't come off on your finger."
3,Why?,"This review could be aimed at a lot of bands, but this had the misfortune of coming on my CD player right after X-Ray Spex. The Checkers play catchy inoffensive girl-fronted punk rock, not too different from the aforementioned legends. Only they lack the attitude, enthusiasm, saxophone and overall creativity. What you're left with is catchy pop-punk songs. There's nothing particularly wrong with any part, the singer sings well, the songs aren't bad, but everything is overdone and trite. After a few songs about love, halfway into the album they're singing about how rebellious and rude they are. No you're not! These guys sound like they play punk rock because, ""I don't know, it's easy""."
5,Lots of HOT sex!!,"Wow! I cannot believe how much HOT sex is in this movie. I also cant believe I'm just now stumbling across this masterpiece. A definite must buy if your a fan of SHANNON TWEED or just beautiful NAKED women. Oh yea, be sure to check for the HOT lesbian love-scene near the end!"
5,I love these flashlights!,"I have owned a lot of these little maglites over the years, and I keep coming back to them. They are great flashlights and are very dependable! The holster is handy if you want to carry it on a belt. For the price, I definitely recommend this flashlight!"
5,great deal,My sons LOVE these flashlights!!! The three of them lay in bed at night and take turns making pictures on the ceiling!! The flashlight comes with an extra bulb which is located in the other end therefore no chance of losing it!!!
2,"Solid maglite construction, disappointing LED","It's a maglite, so you know you're getting a solidly-constructed flashlight. What I was expecting was a maglite that was much brighter and whiter than the traditionally-bulbed ones I already own. I was disappointed in this regard: the LED is not as bright as I expected, and the beam focusing ability was much less than I am used to for a maglite. It's a decent flashlight--just don't expect it to be that much better than the original ones. If you don't own a maglite already, you might want to get the LED version. If you already have one, though, I wouldn't bother replacing it with the LED."
2,Not as good,This light that I got is not as near as brite as the one sold at Sears yet it has the same number???
2,Less then okay of a flash light,"I was wanting a good small flash light I can use when working on my car, having previous bought a Maglite 3-D flash light, I wanted to buy another Maglite. But this mini flash light is not bright at all, and the beam is very small. The cheap Chinese flash lights I buy are brighter then this one. Overall I am very unsatisfied with this product."
2,LED 6 months later,"I have a 3-D cell and a 2-AA led maglight as well as a 2-AA regular maglight. My complaint with the 2-AA maglights, whether led or regular bulb is that they don't hold their charges. I have kept both 2-AA maglights in my car, and barely use it, yet the batteries get drained. The 2-AA maglight is not good with battery life when you have it stored for several months. I've also stored my 2-AA non led flashlight in my house, and same problem, the battery gets drained and I barely use the darn thing. But I guess that's why the maglights are so much cheaper than say streamlight or the other high end flashlights.The 3-D cell led maglight however is great, battery life holds when stored in the house for months, and when using it it doesn't die on you and keeps its brightness."
4,Maglight holder,"For my use this works great. So far I haven't had any issue getting the light it in or out, it does hit the on button sometimes and makes the light flash when you pull it out.I haven't broken it in yet, and the button to close it is very tight, it takes a really firm tug to open it, I assume it will eventually get easier, if not too easy to open.If you pack a flashlight every day you might want one deigned for that, but if your like me and just pack it on your person occasionally (camping trips, hunting, fishing...) this works fine."
4,Good thing for a back pack.,This flashlight is just what I was looking for to go in my backpack. I think everyone could use a small but bright flashlight. If you have ever walk up to a dark door and need light to find the key hole. With this flashlight never again.
1,maglite,I work as an electrician i bought this flashlite a few week ago it does the job right but its not a solid flashlight every time i open it i have to shake it to get a strong light
5,Great gift for Marine!,Gift for my Marine son that just deployed to Afghanistan. He loves it and it works great. This is to clip to his gear bag so he always has a light nearby to look for his stuff.
3,well built but not very bright,"I'm surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for this light. A flashights main purpose is to output light. This flashlight does not do that. I own 5 of these that I got over the years but have been one over by the LED lights that throw out tons more light and last much longer on batteries. While this is very well buily and a nice looking light what it lacks in candlepower makes this just an OK light. If you are comparing it to the cheap plastic flashlights then yes, its a 5 star light but what kind of comparison is that? I know the LED lights costs more but they are coming way down in price and worth the extra money if you want a bright light. I can shine all 5 of mine on new batteries onto the wall and they are stil not as bright as my other LED lights, even the cheap ones. I am not talking about the weak run of the mill LED's but the luxeon or cree models. One of those are brighter than all 5 of my maglights put together."
4,Great bright compact flashlight,"When I received it, I quickly opened it up and popped the batteries in. The intensity of this flashlight amazes me when compared to Maglites of comparable sizes. It is able to compete with the 3D Mag, too! I am planning to upgrade the 3D to a LED bulb because of this flashlight. It certainly is an improvement over the standard 2AA krypton Maglite. It has ""dark spots"" but not the kind that the regular Mag does. The beam is pretty round (a perfect circle, unlike the regular one) and has a bright spot in the center. The focus can be adjusted to make the center wider or more focused. Other than that, it's not really focusable much. \Overall, a great buy for the money. Handy, and bright!"
2,Plastic,"I bought this thinking it was one of the nice law enforcement grade holsters. I was wrong. This is a cheap made in china piece. The leather is not high quality at all, the ring is made of HOLLOW PLASTIC NOT METAL! The snap is also made of plastic. I gave it two stars because one, I know it will break soon, two, it is not what I wanted, and three it is not maglite quality. I have 7 maglites, all of which I have bought from the maglite dealer on amazon. I have never been unsatisfied by the dealer here, or the maglite brand. I am suprised."
5,Very good,This is a very good book on nature magick. Usefull for beginners and more experienced. Cunningham gives very good information in a simple way.
3,"Good, but not his best album","Nas is definitely better that Jay-z, and his flow on ""Last real nigga alive"" implements that. ""Thug's mansion"" and track 2 are also heavy rotations that deserve alot of time in the CD player. The rest of the album is mediocore at best, if not better, than some of his other albums."
1,Oh Nas :(,"How the mighty have fallen. What a weak, half-hearted this album is. The less said about it-the better. ""I Can"", ""Hey Nas"", ""Zone Out""...Get outta here!All he gets is one mic...One mic.."
3,Solid,"Good album, can't front but there were some tracks that I just wasn't feelin. I like the fact though that his lyrics are truth and that he is honest on this joint. Plus, his background music is not a bunch of friggin' samples like someone...*cough cough*."
1,Disappointment,"Very disappointing effort from Nas. When did Nas lose his heart and start making wack pop cuts? Either way, this album is a stinker and may be the proverbial nail in the coffin."
3,"Above average, but not a Classic","This is a nice album, wouldn't call it a classic though. There are a few songs that I just wasn't feeling. But all in all, go cop it, you can't go wrong."
5,Amazing!!!,"This cd is what real hip hop is about!! Songs like ""The Cross"", ""Heaven"" and ""Book of Rhymes"" easily make him the newly elected King of New York. This is a must buy album everybody!"
5,One word: AMAZING,"This CD completes the rap and hip hop world. Jay-Z is going to need to work on an album for a LONG time to top this. You can tell he puts in his heart with the lyrics and beats. This is an awesome invesment and is a perfect gift, etc.!"
4,it aint no stillmatic....,"nas new cd is kinda weak compared to stillmatic... but i supposed thats an unfair comparison. this cd is still tight and one of the best of the year. my favorite tracks are 1-4. i also dont see how u can compare nas to jay-z cuz theyre different types of rappers but in terms of the ""mic battle"" jay-z ""blueprint2"" track destroys nas ""the last real nigga alive"" track... and despite the hating blueprint 2 is tight."
1,Wack,"How the mighty have fallen. Nas used to be one of my favorite artist but I cant even listen to this entire album without skipping tracks constantly. A really weak effort. ""Hey Nas""?? Get that outta here!"
5,(((...*A Modern-Day Classic*...))),"I knew this Cd would be another Modern Day classic after the released of ""Stillmatic"" and ""The Lost Tapes"", I knew Nas would be in the zone and he didn't disappoint.Nas is the illest in the game right now and has been for a while, he just seems to get VERY unfair treatment, he sells with non commercial albums and has done so once again with ""God's Son""This is definately NaS's most personal album to date and a VERY NON commercial album and every joint is sick apart from a coupleNas has been my favorite emcee since ""It Was Written"" and this album in my opinion secures his position as one of Hip-Hop's greatest emcees ever"
5,Transformational,"I read this many years ago, and led a small group through it a few years ago. I think this book has great potential to draw you closer to Jesus, it did me. I've read hundreds of Christian books and this is still one of my favorites."
3,Didn't enjoy as much as her previous books,"These books were recommended by a lot of people. I am a mystery AND romance buff. The problem I have with this series is that I dislike the heroine so much I can't go any further with it. Also, I read the jacket of the second in the series and though what the heck? Roarke (the male lead) was AGAIN the prime suspect. What's up with that???"
5,Book... by J.D. Robb,I received this book in great condition. The shipping was fast as well.I would definitely by from this seller again. I have just discoveredthis series and didn't know it was a series. After I read a couplei realized I needed the first one to answer some questions. I couldn'tfind where I live. And I read it the next day.Thank you.
5,"Wonderful mystery, strong characters, good plot, good series","As good as anything I have read anywhere. Strong characters and very believable supporting characters. I can believe in this woman. Being a science fiction fan I love the futuristic tone of her methodology. I can see this character as not ""science fiction"" but ""science probability"". Eve Dallas is REAL!"
2,Not Good,"I forced myself to finish this book. I don't know why. The solution to the ""mystery"" was painfully obvious from the beginning and I am not a romance novel enthusiast, but I slogged through anyway. The characters of Eve and Roarke were ridiculous romance cliches of damaged needy heroine and rouge with a heart of gold. This book is probably interchangeable with thousands of others. Two stars because Nora Roberts at least had a passable plot and can write above a 10th grade level. Otherwise bleh."
2,"A thriller, which doesnt thrill","This was a mildly entertaining book. The author seemed to spend most of her time describing various sexual acts and not enough plotting. It appears to be lazily written, with things such as naming the futuristic weapon ""a weapon"". I desperately tried to enjoy this book, but did not. Two stars is a bit generous."
2,Just didn't do it for me,"I bought 20+ books in this series not knowing much about them but after reading all the reviews thought they would be terrific. I found this book to be slow and not as futuristic as I was hoping for, although there is a lot of sex and sex crimes. I have started the second book and find myself putting it down looking for something else to read. Looks like it will take me a long time to get through all those books I purchased."
2,Predictable story,"Nothing new in this story, fast read. J..D. probably cranked this out on a weekend. Last one I will read from this author."
3,"Ok, but definitely does not live up to the hype","After reading the glowing reviews for this book, I was eager to read it. Unfortunately, from the beginning I realized that it was not, for me, going to live up to the hype at all. I kept thinking something drastic would happen to make it worthy of its 4.5 star rating, but it never did.I found the ""cop with the tough exterior and painful past, who just needs someone to break through her shell"" to be very cliche.I felt that it was incredibly cheesy in parts and on more than one occassion, I found myself rolling my eyes and saying ""oh, please.""Not only that, but I found some glaring typos. Bad editor!Lastly, the sometimes graphic pedophilia and incest, added for shock value, did not make the book better. It works great for a writer like Stephen King, but not as well for Robb.I give it three stars because it did sort of keep my interest, but I still found it mediocre. Sorry!"
2,Naked in Death,"The characters have potential, however, the end was not much of a mystery - very predictable. I cannot really recommend this book."
4,naked in death,i love j.d. robb i own every in death book they put in audio form. i wish it was unabridged but then you cant have it all. In this book the main charcters or born and start to develup. I enjoy it very much every time i listen to it.
4,Naked in Death by J.D. Robb,Naked in DeathI enjoyed this book immensely! I started the J.D. Robb books a year ago and finally got around to her very first book in the series. Her futuristic crime solving techniques and Eve Dallas' life with Roarke have always kept me entertained.
5,GREAT!,I ordered these for prizes for my son's 2nd grade class. They were adorable and the size was perfect. They were nice quality and a very good price.
3,Good but not great.,"Hey... This is a very funny movie. If you have seen ""Something about Mary"" and ""American Pie"" and are into movies of this sort, I highly recommend ""Road Trip"". However, don't be swayed with this ""unrated"" DVD b.s. It is seriously bogus. There is nothing new or different than the theatrical version to see. The seven deleleted scenes are ones that should have been cut because they are so redundant and unnecessary. Buy this only if you love the version you've seen and will be happy with that. You get nothing more than 5 mins. of fluff.Cheers,Jason"
3,"actually, pretty weak.","if you want a stupid movie you will love, watch Dude, Where's My Car. It is so much more isiosyncratic-- and just plain weird. Road Trip has its moments, but is, on a whole, predictable and lackluster. There are too many low humour jokes that just don't work well. again, check out Dude."
3,"Good Laughs, Decent DVD","Let me begin by saying that this is a good movie, with a huge amount of laughs intact. I was a huge fan of the theatrical release and saw it twice with yes, good intentions. The DvD itself does not have a whole lot of extras, but the deleted scenes are very amusing. They easily bring up the question, ""Why werent these included in the theatrical version?"". Some of the deleted scenes are side splittingly funny, some just strange. Either way, they are enjoyable. The transfer is not the absolute best in the world, but it is good for our non-pesamistic dvd viewers. The ""Unrated"" classification for the movie makes me think....there really not that much different from the movie than from the theatrical. Still good though.So, if you liked the movie, definately pick it up. It will sit right next to American Pie in your collection nicely."
1,DISAPPOINTING AND BADLY AWFUL,"Badly written and acted comedy is a imation of awful comedy teen flicks like AMERICAN PIE 1 and 2,SCARY MOVIE 1 and 2,and terrible other teen films.this comedy has some real laughs and humor but actors give amatuerish acting and plot shifts more dealing on the film about ,crude humor,profanity,nudity,gross out gags,and ineptful situations involving adventures to nasty to write.this film is a stinker and not hilarious either."
5,Funniest Movie on the Market!,"If you love to laugh, this movie is for you. There wasn't five minutes i didn't laugh. However, the movie itself is a bit racey, so keep in mind of that when buying this for anyone under at least fifteen. Buy the movie, love it, and enjoy!"
3,"Not good, Not bad.",This isn't anywhere near the best movie I have ever seen. But it isn't the worst. The characters are quite likable and even though they don't always do the right thing you still root for them. At the end it was worth watching.
5,Brillianty funny!,"I ahven't seen any other todd philips movis, but if i find out about another one, be sure that i'll see it, this movie is the kind of thing you'd expect from the farrelly brothers (dumb and dumber), however with a bit more class. Excellent performances from sean william scott, breckin meyer, and paul costanzo. This should be seen by any comedy lovers."
4,WARNING THE WHOLE STORY DONT READ UNLESS U JUST WANT TO KNOW,It all starts off when Tom Green is leading a tour around his campuss. Then He tells them a story (tour audiance) about a boy and his friends who cheat on His girlfriend who is away. And make a video tape of it send it accidently to his Girlfriend... Thus starts the road trip. Tom Green Surpirisingly decides to stay at the collage. The road trip is long and dumb with a little hurmoers Ques in there. One being Tom Greens name in the movie is BARRY MANOLOW. lol damn it wont let me write no more Well to the next time this MARk
4,An funny rude crazy entertaining comedy.,"The Plot:When Josh(Breckin Meyer) is always loyal to his nice girlfriend(Rachel Blanchard), at first, they were best friends, then they were teenager they turned lovers but then they got separated, which they go to different college schools.

Short Benind the Scenes featurette. Deleted Scenes. Music Video. Grade:B+."
3,Piano Soundtrack,"This review is for the Quality Information Publishers edition of Berlin: Symphony of a Great City.The quality of the film is very good and I am happy with it. My dissapointment was that the included soundtrack is a single piano playing and not a orchestra. Other reviews of this product ""talked"" about the orchestral accompaniment so I was not expecting the piano soundtrack that is on the disc.I feel the orchestral soundtrack adds much more to the film, so my review is 3 stars."
2,"On the dull side, and really not scary","Some spoilers ahead.....Okay, the plot is simple enough. A newlywed couple go from the U.S. to Japan for the guy's photography assignment, apparently run over a woman who then cannot be found, start working, get haunted, freak out a lot, and then the wife finally discovers, after they are back home, that the girl haunting her hubby and killing off his friends was actually the victim of sexual attacks and blackmail by said men. The wife wisely leaves him, and the man pretty much lobotomizes himself, still unable to get rid of the vengeful ghost.Yeah, so? How is this any different from the other pale remakes of much scarier and more subtle Japanese originals? I don't remember being scared at all by this one. Not once. I did, however, find my mind wandering several times."
1,Worst horror movie I have seen in a while.,"This movie was so pathetic it's beyond pathetic, entering a stage of ultimate patheticness that could be pooled together to annihilate the entire planet.There is nothing, NOTHING, scary about the ""scary girl"" in this movie. Compared to The Ring and The Grudge girl she is really a joke. All the ""scary"" moments are nothing but cheesy and stupid, and the actors are unlikeable at best. Very VERY formulaic story also.The only scary thing about this movie is the resulting suicidal tendencies that develop as you become willing to do anything to escape the torture of watching it."
2,SHUTTER ...NEEDS TO GET SHUT DOWN!!!!!,"I was very, VERY disappointed in Shutter. Was looking forward to it since I seen the trailer. How can they make the trailer look so good and make the movie so BAD??? LAME & Bord me most this flick!. I love Ghost stories, but this Ghost & scrpit didn't scare me or get me even in edge my seat at least!! Most Ghosts in horror movies have a evil looks and scare, but this one was lame & most the times corny & laughable! I seen the twist coming from a mile away. Most likely everybody did. The acting was average. The last 10 minutes AND ending was REAL laughable & I am still laughing, what the corny ending & B.S they come up with!!! SKIP THIS LAME GARBAGE! C"
3,Kind of Dumb,"This movie, like all the other lackluster pointless J-horror remakes, had its ups and downs. Some parts were eerie, scary, but most were predictable and dumb. This movie would make for a great rent. I'd probably enjoy this more if I were drunk."
3,Shutter,After reading some reviews I went out and rented this to see what I thought of it. I think it was ok but could have had a little faster pace to it once you first see this womans ghost. I have to say HELL YEAH to the new wife for leaving her husband after finding out his dark secret in the end tho. Good for her. A definite rent before you buy to make sure your gonna like it before you spend the 20 or 30 dollars.
4,Let's have fun with the boys!,"If you like manga / comics, this will be a feast.All-boy, all under Californian shiny skies, playing innocently with one another with skates, surfboards, cars, etc. You fel like joinig them in this outdoor, happy world...A definite keep!"
4,SHOLY HIT!!!,"The opening sequence made me both temporarily incontinent as well as puckered beyond belief. I think it is overall one of the best produced surf films I've ever seen - it really should be seen on the big screen. Cho-poo (sic)(k) was also amazing. It really is incomprehensible to the vast majority of surfers, let alone non-surfers, what these men do. The film attempts to do it justice and I think it does a good job; as good as can be done. I found the commentary educational and entertaining. My 11 and 13 year old children, who are non-surfers to date, also were enthralled. I highly recommend this film, if for nothing other than the opening sequence."
1,P U,It states that this item is for all motorola phones... well it's not for the IC 502.. It does not work with windows Vista either... Disappointed
1,No Cable for Motorola V9m,"Product description says ""for all Motorola Phones"".Neither cable fits my Motorola V9m so product received is unusable.Product description says ""[Retail Packaged]"".The 3 items were stuffed into zip lock sandwich bag.I've never seen any Retail product packaged like this.I have placed the seller ""BargainCell"" on my list that begins with the letter ""S""."
2,Caution!,"I ordered this item for the purpose of transferring pics to the comp. After ordering I found out that Verizon (who I have) makes it impossible to transfer pics using phone tools. (Not sellers fault)I refused delivery when it came. I've been trying since May 9 to get refund from BargainCell. After SEVERAL emails, them saying they don't have the item, tracked the item myself for them, saying my address is unreliable, (all I did was refuse delivery, not move) finally was notified May 28 that I'd get refund. Never again with this seller."
5,Ms. King ...You've Done It Again!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me start off by saying I was most pleased to find that Tryton has found himself someone to love, Nikki.This was anoutstanding read and I finished the book in a day. I then turnedit over to my best friend Rice and she finished it in 5hrs!!She's going to go over it again to make sure she didn't miss anything..lolMy best friend and I were both astounded to find that Trytonfell in love with a sista (a woman of color )!!That definitlywas something to smile about..Ms. King this was one of the great ones, thank you so much and keep them coming.I also would like to know if your going to finally write a book for Grimm? He needs Raines love like no other please write a story for him..Patiently Waiting......"
2,Very Elementary,"I bought this book, thinking it would work well for my college debate class, which is comprised of many ESL and ELL students. It is designed for elementary school students, however, and the word ""debates"" is used VERY loosely to mean opinions (as best as I can guess)."
4,"OK, but could be Better","This compilation could be better if these are also included: Axel F (instrumental track from Beverly Hills Cop), Forrest Gump (piano), Love Story (piano), Top Gun Anthem, Titanic Anthem, Flasdance Love Theme, and Grease instead of Tomb Rider, All The Way, Thanks for The Memory, or Que Sera Sera (at least my mind told me those songs are more memorable). It also sounds odd to mix oldies with songs from 70's, 80's or 90's. Come on Paramount, you can make it better (in 2-CD's if necessary)."
4,"pefect fit, almost","Got my Dashmat on time as always with Amazon very easy to install. Only problem I have with it is it's about 1'' short of covering the dash on the drivers side ,fits real well everywhere else unfortunetly the vent cut outs don't allow you to move the dashmat to compensate for the shortage. Dashmat may need to re-measure for the newer trucks this particular model fits 2005-2008 Toyota Tacoma Dashmat do some home work the 2008 interior is wider than any previous model."
5,"Fits, works","Easy to place, stays put, saves the dash from horrid sun damage. But the most important reason I got it is because the gray original vinyl casts a reflective glare on the inside of the windshield. You need a flat surface, black, to kill this reflection. This does the trick."
5,Late Bloomers -,"I've been a fan of Guy Gerber ever since I sat up and noticed his releases through Diggers' Bedrock label.This album really showcases the talent of Guy Gerber.""State of Change"" is my favourite track very hypnotic.I recommend this album right from the very first listen.Much more listenable than ""From Here to the Sublime""Play this at home when you are getting dinner ready. Pour yourself some wine and start chopping."
5,Excellent,"This was one of my first ""real"" Zen books. Much of what I had read up to this point was western philosophical discussion on Zen. This was one of my first exposures to subjective Zen.Taisen is really cool. Funny & smart.He's agnostic, for example when asked about the existence of a metaphysical realm he says that although he's had metaphysical experiences, nothing can be confirmed or denied so it's best to remain silent.He's got an excellent grounding in science but is a student of Dogen so his agnosticism is shot through with mysticism. He's into opening up, becoming receptive and often comes back to a attitude of; ""Try to look at the tree instead of talking about it. An when you look at it try to not see your notions of the tree. Go beyond that.""He always comes back to the actual practice of Zazen over thinking about Zen. Without the experience of Zazen notions of Zen are empty."
2,Collectors Item Only.....Maybe,"The only song worth listening to on the whole CD was the version of ""Tessie"" which included the members of the Red Sox. The guys of Dropkick Murphys sounded like they were trying to be cool and 'In' and they just weren't."
1,Very Disappointing,"As someone from the Pacific who has had a lifetime dream to travel Copper Canyon, and who has already visited Yucatan, this DVD is not only repetative, it is downright boring. It does not shows nothing of value of the thirteen hour trip through the canyon, nor of the trip from Mexico City to Yucatan. Frankly a waste of money --- If Amazon was closer, I'd return this for a refund and buy a good Mexican travel guide instead! I certainly won't be buying the other 9 in this series to qualify for a carry on travel bag!"
4,Wish I could see this at the cinema,"This is really a funny comedy full of cool things. When I watched it for the first time, I mainly enjoyed what I saw on the screen. People who usually are at school or work are playing in the snow on a regular business day when all businesses are closed. Snow makes here a lot of things enjoyable. I wish it had been available in my country earlier - now I had to hurry the availability by entering an international order. And the reason why no fifth star is that international orderers should be aware that the player has to be capable of playing back enforced region 1, that means it has to be manually switchable between regions if bought at a region other than region 1. That is a bad issue and I'm in fact collecting names to object the limitation and to support the 1948 United Nations Human Rights Declaration article XIX. Fortunately I've managed to get - after a long search - a player which works with this disk too, even if I live on region 2."
4,Snow Day,"This is a fun family movie to watch. It reminded me of when I was a kid and wanted that all to needed, school is out, due to snow. The portrayal of the sitting at the kitchen table to hear that your school is closed is brought to the screen all to well. I rented the movie, and will buy this movie for many years of family fun. A definte add to any family collection. The producers of this movie (Nick-O-Lodien) pulled off a Disney frame of film that is all too good. The DVD version off this movie has the extras that will surprise you."
2,"Funny narrating, lame stories","The language is very witty and entertaining. However the plots are thin, forced and ridiculous. The characters, especially the female ones, are not believable. Overall, pretty lame stories told in humorous language."
5,pelichicken,"Great truck flashlight, very tough and durable, good quality, well built, worth the money liked it cause its not just another black flashlight"
4,Maglite 2D torch,"Great Torch. Its good quality materials make it solid and reliable, I would recommend this torch. Battery life seems to be good too."
2,Once great now a relic.,"While the quality of the build of this instrument is top notch, the technology is outdated. Several companies have improved the beam quality, bulb life and electrical reliability of similar products. Solid state technology (LED light) has made the standard D-cell light a dim unreliable unit. The company has rested on it's laurels for too long. Other companies have made brighter smaller longer life units in standard bulb (incandescent) and solid state (LED) formats for a number of years now. See companies like Streamlight, SureFire, Brinkmann and search for ""LED Flashlights"" for the whole array of new technologies.Most of my Mag Lights have been retired in favor of LED technology lights with comparable output plus extended battery life and bulbs that last for 50,000 plus hours. Mag faces the risk of becoming the 8-track version of the flashlight in my opinion."
5,Deep fryer heaven,"This book is a hoot. We purchased it particularly for the deep fried turkey recipe, but there's lots more - all very entertaining, and terrific ideas both for theme dinners and the ""what should I bring"" quandry - trust me, you'll never duplicate what anyone else brings to the table!"
4,"Very Enjoyable, but got off track","If you are a wrestlign fan, you will enjoy it. Lots of funny sarcasm and tasty bits of backstage politics.The problem is, it focuses too much on being a history of the last 15 years of pro wrestling, and often lost focus of bringing up the worst ideas in wrestling. A book similar to the old Baseball Hall of Shame series would have been far better, in which the various catagores of bad ideas are the chapters and then list the most egregious examples. This is too much of a straight history for a book with its supposed thesis.As a wrestlign book, its five stars. BHut for one with a specified topic, its only a 4 out of 5."
5,Great Pictures.,"So I don't read the articles, but the pictures inside are wonderful!!!! The advertisements and pictures throughout the whole magazine are so pretty and awesome to use!"
4,"A pleasant, easy way to ride the train...","While the first video in this series displayed luxurious or special-purpose mountain trains, this one focuses a bit more on giving us a European tour (through Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Sweden) on the kind of trains ordinary folks are likely to use for day trips. The scenery, as viewed from the trains, is quite interesting, and the narrator takes time to educate the audience about ancient castles seen along the way, and their history. The background music is a bit tepid, but on balance the trips are enjoyable."
1,"What we don't like yesterday, we'll never like ever!","This si a pretty lame cd, if your 95 years old and you like Mitch Miller's sing-a-long records than you;ll dig this, but if you have any aelf respect you'll stay away from this lame cd taht has no romance a all. Skip this one, it should never have been released EVER!!! How sad that thsi cd is so bad."
4,Good Presentation of the T-37,"This DVD provides a good look at formation aerobatics from several different points of view (in-cockpit, external, etc.). While there is no narration, it has great visuals and is worthwhile for any aviation enthusiast."
5,Beautiful and silky smooth,"I got an unbelievable deal on this pen at a store that was clearing out odds and ends, but it's easily worth the price here. I have about half a dozen fountain pens, and this is definitely one of my favorites. The nib is beautiful, and writes very smoothly, without getting slippery. The ink flow is free, but not so much to cause ink blobs; just perfect. This pen is really nice looking, too. The cap snaps very solidly onto the pen, on both ends. It'll never come off on its own. The bottom of the cap has ""Waterman Paris"" and ""France"" in gold letters on opposite sides."
3,Wrong nib size!!!,I ordered the Waterman Expert Gold Fountain Pen with Fine Nib but received the pen with a medium nib and it writes to big.
3,Scandalous reading!,"This book made me feel like a fly on the wall in the Jackson household. The author does a great job of revealing Jermaine's dysfunctionality. Yet she still did so without bashing him, keeping in mind he is the father of her children. A must read for Jackson curiosity-seekers. The book is a bit one-sided. The author freely discusses Jermaine's infidelity, but fails to go into detail about her adulterous relationship with him during his union with Hazel Gordy-Jackson."
4,Worthy of Attention,"I came across a copy of this book in the library and the title drew my attention. I read it in three hours, at one sitting though the experience itself was no fun. Trueblood is advocating a re-reading of the synoptic gospels focusing on the humor of Jesus Christ found in his wit, banter and irony. In this approach of seeking humor, he seems to adopt a Bultmannian approach to the interpretation of the gospels. I am afraid that in his eagerness to find humor in the saying and parables of Jesus, he has to be guarded not to end up doing disservice to the message itself. But Elton Truebllod has brought out a wonderful area worthy of further exploration and possible research."
4,I was pleased with this product overall. The ...,I was pleased with this product overall. The mascara goes on well and stays on. The brush is very thick and allows good application. The color is as described. The mascara didn't run during the day. It's well worth the money.
4,Good quality flashlight,Had a little trouble getting it going but it seems pretty solid now. Good size light with decent illumination. Comes with spare bulb at the base of the handle. No complaints.
3,good value for family; not for heavy use,"i am a preschool teacher and this product was too flimsy for 'high traffic' use, although i imagine it would be fine for a small family. nice alternative to plastic options at similar price"
3,"Fun, if a little typical!","This book is what first got me interested in the story of Elizabeth Bathory, but, after researching her in fact, I seems a lot of what is written in ""Blood Ritual"" is heavily embellished. This is to be expected, I suppose. Giving Elizabeth another child, giving her powers she never posessed and creating a Bathory family legacy that would probably offend any surviving descendants just to spice up the story is all well and good, but it is misleading. At the beginning of the book the author claims to have written a lot from fact, but I disgress- the story is what I'm supposed to be reviewing. It's an interesting story and it passes the time, but apart from that I can't give it more than a lukewarm reccomendation. The love story between the nun and our blind hero is sappy and sickly-sweet, but descriptions of Elizabeth's crimes, though exaggerated, can almost make up for it."
5,Awesome Stapler,"My office has had other automatic staplers but this is the best. And the flat staples are much easier to remove, no matter how thick the document. The MAX handheld staplers are awesome, too."
3,One of the Best Songs I've ever heard.,"This album was my first exposure to Jon Mark and Johnny Almond. It features ""What Am I Living For"" which is one of my all-time favorite songs. Beyond that the ""Organ Grinder"" is typical of Jon Mark's later efforts. The rest of the album falls short of the group's other albums. This album marked a shift from the more upbeat and ecclectic first two albums to the latter lounge singer/jazz efforts which culminated with the great ""To The Heart"" album."
2,Don't censor the classics,"I was about to give this a 5 star review because it is one of two movies that changed my life (La Dolce Vita the other) when I was in my late teens. Frederic Raphael who wrote this along with the great TV series The Glittering Prizes (run don't walk to buy this with Tom Conti) wrote this based on the ""lovies"" whom he knew in school and Julie Christie's scenes with Dirk Bogarde (truly one of the most underrated actors of all time.....buy Pinter's The Servant and see what great acting is truly like) and with Laurence Harvey (not a great actor but a good one and a great type) are priceless. But to hear that this movies is not the original cut is depressing and so wait until Criterion comes out with the ""real/reel"" versionPatrick Cronin"
3,Was she really darling?,"This movie was a good example of what was swinging at the time but not great. I saw Shampoo at the same time, oh my. Worth seeing however."
3,Julie Christie saves this drab film.,"Darling starring Julie Christie in her Oscar-winning role is a good movie but nothing worth viewing again. Christie definitely deserved the Oscar for her performance as shallow but intriguing Diana Scott, she was quite a beauty back then. The plot is a bit contrived and the film drags too much, making this film too long. The only reason to watch Darling is for the strong acting but otherwise than that, Darling is pretty much forgettable."
5,Excellent,My father has ALWAYS had a MAGLIGHT handy in our house growing up. I got this one for my Fiance since he asked for one. They are good products. Highly recommend. You can use it for lighting.. and if you are out walking alone it is heavy enough to use as protection as well.
5,It is a great book!,"I think this book is great! It has a cool plot, and great characters. The protagonist, Lucien, has cancer and can barely even talk, so he is given a beautiful note-book that his father found so he can write down what he needs to say. When he falls asleep cluching the book, it transports him to Talia (Italy), to Belleza (Venice), the City of Masks, where he is not sick. He goes on a exciting, interesting adventure that I suggest you don't miss!Also, once you read this, I suggest you read City of Stars and City of Flower (City of Flowers is not yet published)"
2,Diasppointing - very poor quality,"Watch was not running when arrived, dead battery. So if ordering as a gift be aware. ""charming cartoon-style character"" is a pretty ugly piglet-like creature.Bag the watch arrived in was dirty, with black marks over pale pink.Wouldn't recommend this product, especially think twice if ordering this as a gift.Update: watch bracelet broke after 4 days of wear"
2,Cookies and seap together?,beautiful but it is not a good idea putting soap and cookies in a box.After a white cookies taste like soap!
4,Interesting movie.,"This movie needs t obe seen more. I found about it few years ago. I finally bought it and definitely it's worth the time. Aprox. 90 min.The plot is simple, but it has substance. Highly recommended."
5,If I Were A Writer,"This story is about a young girl who's mother is a writer. The girl watches her mother work and picks up pointers on things that writers do. The girl then starts some writing of her own. As a teacher, I have found that, this book inspires my students to become writers and it is wonderful to use with ""writer's workshop."""
2,Good idea but boring,I read this book to my 6 and 8 1/2 year old and they both asked if we could read something else after the third page. They found it pretty boring (and I did too).
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK,"This book is completely useless. This book could be useful for someone with no prior knowledge on investing BUT it's very unlikely as the person who wrote this book had typos throughout the book. I have a problem with buying a book that says ""Series 7 exam prep"" and discusses nothing about the exam. Not worth the money spent , i wouldn't even buy it used. PAGE 66 ...the word on the first paragraph should be ""manage"" not ""mange"" although at some points of this book i really thought it was in french. So useless."
4,Sonata Arctica's...Silence,"Honestly, when I first heard this release, I wasn't that impressed! Sonata Arctica offers a different style than anyone else within the power metal genre, and it may take a few listens to get use to. Once it made sense to me what these guys are doing, they have become one of my favorite bands! Like Savatage, Sonata Arctica creates an atomosphere with there music. Don't get me wrong, they sound nothing like Savatage, but they have a talent for bringing out what they are feeling through their music. Basically, Sonata Arctica is power metal at its best! Hopefully, these guys will play at the ProgPower fest in Atlanta sometime!"
5,Silence: excellent album.,"I bought SILENCE after a couple SA songs stuck out on my Pandora, and I noticed the resoundingly positive reviews.This is a solid album, end to end. And there is really a lot there. There are a ton of moods in the 13 tracks, but not at the expense of continuity over the course of the album. There are some excellent parts for each instrument as well as vocals on Silence. And ""The Power of One"" is really a gem, one of my favorite songs overall.The one thing that strikes me as kind of funny is the role of the same ""old man"" voice as some kind of philosopher, some kind of stalker, and some kind of prophet at different points in the album."
5,Perfect for those awkward moments...,"This mini maglite comes in handy when you are looking for the right key in the dark, or if you drop something on the street in a badly lit area. I've also used it so I could see behind my computer or entertainment center, mainly because it isn't big and bulky. You never have to worry, because it's always in your pocket, ready to be used at anytime. The array of colours is just a nice little touch."
1,Product Description is Incorrect - this is NOT an LED flashlight,"I bought this small flashlight, as I wanted something small but with the power, durability, and endurance of an LED bulb. I purchased this product because it said ""BULB TYPE"" was LED. Well, I took it out of the package, and that's when I noticed that it was infact an incadescent bulb, not an LED one. The power output is a fraction of what the same flashlight would offer if it was LED.Before bying this, I wanted to make sure it was the right one on MagLite's website ([...]). It sure seemed that way to me, considering the bulb type is very clearly listed as LED.So, if you want an LED flashlight, get something else - this is not one of them. This is a relatively useless flashlight, and I couldn't be any more disappointed with it."
2,Dont like it!,"I have 2 of these and dont like them.you have to turn the head too many times to get to the proper beam for general lighting.I highly recommend you get the next model up.""Mini Maglite"" that takes 2 AAA's is the best, best lighting and not too big or small.I have 3 of them, love them.ran over one and it still works great.I have 1 of the 2 AA model which is the next size up.Just like the next size smaller its horrible.Good luck!Also, Maglite is the best you can buy period, do not be cheap and try other brands you'll be let down, soon!"
2,not bright enough,"The quality is great and it's easy to operate. I bought a couple of these as keychain lights. However, the light output even with a fresh battery really isn't sufficient for my use."
3,some pitfalls,"These lights are nice in that they fit in your pocket easily, however I've found some bad things too. First, they aren't all that bright to begin with, but over time the contacts inside the light get messed up (perhaps from rubbing against the battery) and they are even dimmer. I periodically have to disassemble mine and clean it up with a pencil eraser.I've finally switched to a 2 AAA battery light."
3,"Not great, but okay light","This light is okay.Cons: It's not a bright light.It's not a LED.You have to twist it to create the desired focus (a plus if you actually want a wide scatter beam, a minus if you want a quick focused beam)Pros: It's small.It's light.Water resistant.Not sure about the battery complaints. I use it for quick (<1 minute) uses, from time to time. Been using the same battery for a good full year.I think MagLite issuing LED 'upgrade' bulbs for the AA battery models is quite an admission that MagLite isn't the top in this category anymore. I am hoping their engineers can come up with a LED 'upgrade' bulb for this single, AAA battery model as well. I'd imagine it would be a better light."
5,the final/fantastic years of miles career,"Most of the other reviewers have already lucidly described the value of this box. Even if Miles 80s albums did not ""do much for you"", you should check this set out. These live recordings contain ample evidence that Miles could still improvise, select brilliant musicians for his bands, and create vital live music. The price for this set may seem high, but you're getting twenty discs of incredible music, and many Amazon partners sell it at a lower price. If you're hesitant to take the plunge on this box, try Miles' single disc ""Live Around The World"". If you enjoy that, you can't be without this set. Highest of recommendations."
4,Complete and very enjoyable,"It's a pleasure to listent to these songs again. Julio Iglesias has a style of his own since the '70s and has been able to update it through all these decades and to add something new each time he decided to make a new CD. Either alone or in duet with other stars (particularly with Sinatra, Ross and Parton), his voice sounds perfectly and adds a peculiar richness to any song he chooses to sing. I'm totally satisfied!"
1,slow motion,you herd of fed express well this guy uses pony express if u/r lucky if not it will come by dog sled and this gohasting co is in mexico waiting for snowLatex Monkey with Banana
5,"Sweet story, nice illustrations","My 24-month old son enjoys the journey of big and little bear, and their return home to their warm cave. The story is sweet and simple, but engaging enough to hold my son's interest and keep him asking for more. I look forward to seeing other books from this series."
3,OK but a little too snug,"Bought this for my new Weber Performer (post-2005). It fits very snuggly--almost too much so because it is somewhat harder to put it on. I wish it were a little looser. Reminds me of the old tight jeans I used to squeeze into back in the day--love my comfy loose-fitting jeans so much better. In any case, HQ, thick vinyl with nice weber logo for that show factor!"
4,A Little Bit of Canadian Nostalgia,"Growing up in Toronto and listening to Top 30 station Chum AM, I first became acquainted with Toulouse via a French/English hit called ""It Always Happens This Way"" in the late '70s. ""APB,"" ""What Would My Mama Say,"" and ""If You Ever Need Someone"" were released as singles, but none I think hit the charts. Nevermind. This collection brings back memories and still has a soft rock/pop almost ""bluesy"" contemporary feel. Good to see the girls made it to CD. Now, if we could get ""Taxi Pour Une Nuit Blanche"" on disc..."
1,INCORRECT DESCRIPTION,"Look! I know this ring is NOT available at this time, but as long as you have it listed you should tell the truth about it. I bought this ring from Amazon in 2007, and there is NO WHITE GOLD anywhere on it. That's just a photo-illusion. Plus, there are ONLY 30 DIAMONDS on it, not 34 as listed. You can count them yourself from the picture. Either CORRECT the description, or remove this item entirely from the listings. Thanks!"
4,Almost 5...Almost...,"Just like the 1st Greatest Hits cd,this cd is near flawless,song for song perfection...almost...and has all the greatest hits...cept 2 of the greatest! where is Angry All The Time and Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me ? Now if anyone says ""Just to hear you say..."" isnt his song,its Faith's,i'd agree until i seen 1 of the worst songs Tim ever did landed on this cd somehow,which also wasnt his song,why in the heck is ""Over and Over"" on this cd? Whyyyyyyyyy! ,it'd be 1 thing if he needed a filler song,and he chose it,theres always a good 1 or 2 ""skipable"" songs on any cd,but to put this song on,and not his real hits is a shame and a disgrace to Tim,im now possitive he didnt have say in the choosing of songs,he just took his cover pics for the label,and they shipped out a almost perfect cd..."
4,"Awesome new songs, crappy selection...","I have to say that he missed the boat on this one. I realize you don't ant to kill off other albums sales, but his album cuts are good too!Certainty #1- When the stars go blue is an AWESOME song. his BEST song to date!Certainty #2- The last reviewer and his/her boss are tone deaf idiots!I am not a real big country fan but Tim's songs are very good...As for the selection, the better list would be:The Cowboy In MeUnbrokenAngry All The TimeGrown Men Don't CryShes My Kind Of RainWatch The Wind Blow ByLive Like You Were DyingDo You Want Fries with thatMy Old FriendClassic Cut: One Of These DaysNew Cuts: When The Stars Go Blue & My Little GirlAlbum Cuts: Telluride & How Bad Do You Want ItThere, 14 songs and a perfect setlisting.I am giving it 4 stars for one reason, When The Stars Go Blue!"
1,Butchery,"A decent collection overall of his ""good"" songs (I don't really like him anyways), but he completely manages to butcher ""When the Stars Go Blue."" The original is WAY better, and The Corrs covered it with Andrea and Bono (from U2) MUCH better. The country twang just totally kills the mood of the song. I am a professional audio engineer, and heard him do this song live and it just made me cringe. Skip this CD."
5,one of the best cd's,i'm not a big fan of greatest hits but this one is a MUST for you listening pleasure
4,Billy's Best,"I'm not much of a billy joel fan, but this is really a remarkable album. Up there with Joni Mitchell's 'Miles of Aisles' as an endearing document to Joel's uncorrupted talent.Unfortunatley, Joel veered towards schmaltzy commercialism almost immediatley after this album's release (although 'the Nylon Curtain,' which came after this, was pretty good).These songs are personal, almost auto-biographical. There is romantacism to tracks like 'Summer Highland Falls,' with 'You're My Home' being perhaps the best song Joel has written."
5,Billy Joel's best CD EVER!!!!,Billy Joel truly explodes in this CD. He definately put his best foot forward. His entire heart and soul are in EVERY song on the CD. Such power in this concert. His very best!!!
4,Songs On the Stage,"This album was recorded on various days and at various locations between June and July 1980. Billy was promoting his GLASS HOUSES album. He and his band decided to tape a few concerts from the tour and release some live performances of his pre-STRANGER material. We start with a TURNSTILES track,MIAMI 2017(Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway),recorded at New York City's famous Madison Square Garden. Also recorded there was THE BALLAD OF BILLY THE KID. With this album,SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD,originally a TURNSTILES track,became a hit. So did a COLD SPRING HARBOR track,SHE'S GOT A WAY. The album also contains songs from PIANO MAN and STREETLIFE SERENADE. Each title gives its own date and location of recording. Too bad ANGRY YOUNG MAN was not used for this album. Another TURNSTILES track that would be later recycled for Billy's next live album KOHUEPT. There should have been PIANO MAN on this album also."
3,Typical Miles,This Cd is Miles coming into the fusion era. I am from the old school of bee bop and it was just OK to me. It seems the music that I like is from musicians that are too old to play or are dead.
3,Not my favorite Miles,"For some reason it sounds like the band is trying to hard to sound different and creative. There is a lot of experimentation with time signiture, and chords, and the songs sound so bad because of that. I have heaard many bands experiment the same way with good results. (ex. Dave Brubeck's Time Out Album) The songs also sound very loose and uninspired. I just don't get what all the hype about this album is."
4,excellent DADGAd,"This video was incredible. If you are into fingerstyle guitar (especially DADGAD tuning) you will really like this. It shows 6 great guitarists playing music that they call ""celtic"" but really only about a quarter of them could you call them that by listening to them. Most are in the alternate tuning DADGAD but some are in other tunings. The best thing is the DVD can be put into a computer and gives you the tablature to print. It is also great to just watch/listen to. The slow music is amazingly relaxing and the faster ones are great too. It is for only good fingerstyle (no flatpicking) guitarists that use the dadgad or other tunings. If you use standard tuning the music is untranslatable because the low strings are lowered too far down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
3,Info Lit is not just for Librarians,You would think from reading this book that librarians are the only professionals interested in information literacy and that information literacy is only the ability to use the library and its resources whereas true information literacy is so much more!It is an excellent resource in the foundations of info lit instruction for the library professional.
4,EROTIC/BDSM,"I enjoy all of Joey Hill's books. She is just an excellent writer, very sophisticated and complex subjects.I really enjoyed this book but I loved Marguerite and Tyler's story even more. There just was more to it and it made more sense psychologically. Also, I must be old fashioned because I still like the man to be the Dom.My all time favorite still remains the Vampire series with Elyssa and Jacob. That is absolutely the BEST"
5,Captivating,"This book is very interesting and well-written, with well-developed characters and a suspenseful plot. Also, it is unusual in that the Dom character is female, which kept tweaking me all through the book.I think Mahlet at [...] ([...]) says it best in her review of Natural Law:""Natural Law, part of Joey Hill's Nature of Desire series, is probably one of the most realistic, well-written depictions of the more extreme side of BDSM that I have encountered. It's also the first ""alpha male as sexual sub"" or just ""male-as-sub"" erotic romance that I've read. I definitely prefer to read about males that stay alpha, in and out of the bedroom, but Joey Hill's writing captivated me anyway. """
2,Not Standard Franken,"I think fans of Franken's political satire books will find this book a sad change of pace. While certainly not the worst book of the year and even funny in some places, Franken's trademark bite is curiously lacking.Perhaps one of the strangest things Franken tries to do several times throughout the book is to change pace abruptly from comedy to serious advice. It does not work well, and is almost a pardoy of itself in that sense. Although the sections on marriage are often well-written and humorous, Franken partisans should know they aren't getting Al at his best here. True fans won't mind, but the casual reader will want to wait for another book in the political medium Franken seems to save the best of his talent for."
2,"A clever satire but,","It's a quick read, and you never know if Franken is being serious or not. I read it in about an hour, and there wasn't anything in there that would make me laugh out loud. Franken should stick to writing political satire, where he is much better."
1,"Oh, What A Waste of Time!","It takes a dedicated Al Franken fan to enjoy this book. For those of us who merely enjoy (or tolerate) Franken's humor, this book is basically just a slapdown of random, useless thoughts designed only to consume an hour of your reading time and a few of your hard earned $$. Twenty-nine five page chapters give the bookstore thumber ample opportunity to quickly find a snippet of apparent wisdom and interest, which upon reading is swiftly disposed of to make room for the next abbreviated chapter. Several chapters contain nothing but the kind of filler used by a grade-school journal writer to increase his word count (3 pages of areas codes - c'mon, that's 2% of the total book!). Franken can't even use his own jokes, and resurrects Buddy Hackett's. Does that alone tell you what you need to know?For serious and substantial laughs, stick with PJ O'Rourke and Michael Moore."
2,Pure Disappointment,"After reading Al's book on Rush I was ready to read anything Al Franken wrote. Wow, was that a mistake. Oh the things i know! makes me think Al wrote the book in his sleep. Not only is it not funny, it's not clever either. Al fills his book with bad advice and tries to pass it off as him being humorous. Sure, there's the occasional funny part- the politics chapter- the religion chapter- but overall this Al book is simply dumb and unhumorous. It is a shame Al used his big name to get away with publishing such crap."
2,So Sad...,"When I reviewed Franken's ""Why Not Me?"" I explained that I had read it because I loved ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big..."" but ""Why Not Me?"" had fallen short of my high expectations. THIS book was even MORE disappointing. The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny. Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- ""Lies..."" of course). It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something. Otherwise, pick something else by Franken. ANYTHING else by Franken."
4,A World Challenge,"Steven Newman was not a professional writer and he did not pretend to be. But he was on a quest to circle the globe on foot, and part of the deal was that he wanted to record the journey on paper. The most challenging aspect of his plan was that he was not bankrolled. This meant that he had to depend totally upon those he met on the walk to feed and house him. Newman took many months to fulfill his quest and a few detours occurred along the way, but he did circumnavigate the globe. His account is remarkable throughout, and, in spots, downright unique. In my opinion, his achievement leaves individuals like Peter Jenkins far behind in the world of backpacking quests."
1,Eric Bana like you've never seen him before.,"Eric Bana put on a lot of weight (ooh!) for this role by eating lots of donuts in the morning. he plays a prisoner who still has a criminal mind in prison. He still kills people in prison and prisoners try to kill him. They stab him. Take a piece of his ears. And still he survived. The movie was filmed off-tint and off-color. This film would have been 75% better without the off-tint/off-color stuff. Normal color and studio lighting would have been just fine. I dislike movies that are color-bleached. Brilliant performance by Eric Bana. He looks good with the extra weight.By the way, in regards to the bar scene, that is not a real male ""member"" and is not really of Eric Bana. They just wanted to bring across the real spirit of the prisoner this movie portrayed."
1,Laughable amatuerish dreck,"This movie has been compared to masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoire Dogs. The question is why? Chopper does contain explicit gore scens such as ear mutilations and shootings. Apart from the violence, Chopper lacks the humor and masterful direction from Tarantino's classic works. In addition, the acting is substandard and the plot quite simple and boring.This movie has been hyped up to be the biggest thing out of Australia for years but Chopper disappoints on all levels except the DVD transfer which is tolerable.If you want to see an Australian classic, watch Roadwarrior; Mad Max 2 and stay away from Chopper, which is one stinking DVD, which reeks of cheap production and lame acting."
4,Weird but captivating,Like a train-wreck - with probably about as much gore.An interesting look into the soul of the 80's Australian crime scene (or at least a dramatisation thereof).
2,Disappointing,"Calling myself a huge fan of Tammy Wynette is an understatement. She has always been #1 in my mind, therefore I have been anxious to find new CD releases of her albums. I bought the Collector's Edition which was remixed by Billy Sherrill himself and immediately wondered what went wrong. I love the idea of having an ""uncut"" version of the songs and being able to hear Tammy, Billy, and the studio musicians conversing with one another, but all of the previously unreleased numbers were evidently mastered on a different speed machine. It's like listening to a 33 rpm record played at 45 rpm. Common Epic Records! The First Lady of Country Music deserves much more than she got out of this tribute. I've never heard of a recall on a CD, but Epic needs to remaster this one and recall and replace the entire stock with a carefully crafted tribute to Tammy. Needless to say, I am disappointed in this release. Epic, Tammy gave her all. Now it's your turn."
3,An EPIC let down,"First off, it is not Tammy Wynette that disappoints in this collection, it is EPIC Records that fails. They present this collection undocumented, boast more ""unreleased"" songs than are contained in the collection and their remixing of these early recordings is poor to say the least, with Wynette's voice sounding sped up to sometimes near Minnie Mouse quality. EPIC (Sony Music) should show as much loyalty to Tammy as she did them. Future (and hopefully there will be more) releases should be placed in more considerate production hands."
4,Reaches out and grabs you,"This is the third of his works I have read and the first in which the subject is not serial killers. The story prefaces with the heroine Maggie Bradford shooting her first hsband as he attempts to kill her. The novel then moves to Maggie in prison after being accused of killing her second husband. Her story is compelling as the details of her life unfold. The story has a couple of unexpected twists ( as Patterson has done in his other novels) and moves at light speed.In brief, it is a fast paced story which is easy to read and impossible to put down."
4,"Good read, but not Alex Cross","This was the second Patterson I have read ( the first being Along Came A Spider) and I found it predictable but enjoyable. It gets tedious, so you have to want to finish. I did so and read it in 1 1/2 days. Its good, but read the Alex Cross books first."
1,...,"The only GREAT James Patterson novel I have read is ALONG CAME A SPIDER. This book I was hoping would equal ALONG CAME A SPIDER in quality, but it failed miserably.It was boring; it was uneven and just plain ridiculous. I have to admit the ending surprised me, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this book.Warning: Very explicit sex passages, including one featuring incest."
1,A boring and pointless book,"Although I read the whole book, for no reason other than loyalty to one of my favourite authors, I have to say that James Patterson lost the plot in this book! I still can't quite work out the point of it. The story was immensely boring and I didn't care about the characters, any of them! Maggie irritated the hell out of me and her daughter was equally as irritating. If you are about to delve into the world of James Patterson don't start with this book - it's not a very good first impression of Mr Patterson's writing talent."
3,"Not unentertaining, but really not all that good","The forward was perhaps the most interesting thing about the novel. Otherwise, it was the sort of prose that, while it may have been novel for its time, is now quite hackneyed (the whole first chapter was atrocious, by the way!). The same could be said for the general storyline, too.Most of the novel concentrates on the minutiae of (a) being poor, (b) being Italian, and (c) being Catholic, and after awhile the discussions of venial versus mortal sins, and of the class standings of Italians in Denver in the Depression, and of how they only get to eat meat once a fortnight -- well, it gets to be a bit much after about 15 pages or so. And I don't think this book had that much to say about anything else."
2,IT LOOKS ORANGE,"I LOVE THE WATCH, ALWAYS WANTED ONE, BUT THE WATCH IS AN ORANGE COLOR. I TRIED TO CONTACT THE SELLER BUT NO RESPONSE, I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED THE BABY-G BUT IN PINK ONLY. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SELLER DID NOT CONTACT ME BACK NOR TO PUT ANY DIRECTIONS IN THE BAG, I STILL HAVE A PROBLEM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE WATCH CORRECTLY"
5,"Simple, Powerful, Transformative","David Emerald's ""Power of TED*"" is a life-changing kinda book. His simple, quick-to-read, powerful story helps us understand how we're showing up in the world--as a Creator or Victim? Coach or Rescuer? Challenger or Persecutor? Knowing the characteristics of The Dreaded Drama Triangle (DDT) and it's creative alternative, The Empowerment Dynamic (TED*) is remarkably transformative. It's impossible for me to overstate my enthusiasm for the book (after reading it the first time I immediately ordered copies for my employees and friends and family) and I hope you take the time to explore Emerald's ideas and transform your life as well!"
5,Awesome die-cast replica,"I really like every feature of this item...hood opens , doors open , trunk opens and shows the NOS bottle included inside ...I hope more replicas from the fast and the furious movie become available soon !!!"
3,not as good as i expected,"the locks used to keep it from opening all the way during normal use, but open to empty are poorly designed... i expected more from zippo, and after i learned this was made in china rather than the USA like most of zippo products, things started to make sense."
5,Truly underappreciated masterpiece,"This album is packed with some of Billy's most powerful pop.I read the Amazon review and could not agree less.The singles are somewhat overplayed but there are some great songs here.I love the sultry ""Rosalinda's Eyes"",the pulsating ""Stilletto"", and the infectious ""Zanzibar"" but the topper is ""Until the Night:.This is an epic song of 7 minutes that varies from the soft beginning and building to a crescendo as he busts out into the night.Very intense stuff.I highly reccomend this disc to all Billy fans and those just discovering his magic."
5,Fantastic,"As the follow up to Joel's breakthrough The Stranger, this album suffered in comparison to the hit-packed Stranger. However, with 27 years of perspective, it is time to acknowledge the true genius of this album.As always, Joel tries to be all things to all people. There are the obligatory top 10 hits (""Big Shot,"" ""Honesty,"" ""My Life."") There are some smooth jazz riffs (""Zanzibar,"" ""Stiletto,"" ""52nd Street."") There's even a little Latin music (""Rosalinda's Eyes."") The real hidden gem here, though, is Joel's unexpected Righteous Brothers tribute ""Until The Night.""All in all, this deserves a worthy spot on any ""Desert Island Disc List."""
2,hanes polo tshirt,the total price of almost ten dollars(including shipping) wasn't worth it. the quality was very thin and the sewing wasn't professionally done- the buttoned down part by the neckline was not straight and there were threads loose here and there. i would have kept it if it was just thin but the sewing was just too cheap looking.
4,"Good price, lightweight","This shirt is holding up well, and is comfortable. I wear it doing contractor work in Afghanistan - it seems to be durable and fits nicely - I'm athletic. I would buy it in other colors."
3,Hanes Polo Shirt,"The reason I am not entirely satisfied with this product is probably my own fault. I thought it was advertised and shown as a ""pocket"" polo shirt. Surprise, surprise, no pocket. The shirt was delivered on time, as promised, and the shipping was not excessive, so, no problem with the Texas Shirt Co. The Hanes shirt, itself, was more like T-shirt material instead of like a real polo shirt, so I would opt for a polyester blend in the future. Again, the compaly is first rate, but the shirt was a disappointment, and, at this price, it is not worth the hassle to return it."
3,Sound methods but a bit preachy,"This book / kit is good for people interested in learning about insight meditation. However I found it a bit ironic that some of the Buddhist teachings are around moderation and even in the preface of this book it uses some very strict wording around your lifestyle, postures that you HAVE to do, etc. etc.Personally, I like the techniques but I wasn't a fan of the ""you have to do this exactly this way"" parts."
4,Should be classified as Introductory to Basic Meditation only,"The Book is an excellent material for those newbies that is interested to Meditation, regarding with the Insight Meditation procedure that is being introduced, I find it not usual compared to the ones thought with the Theravada Style of Vipassana-Bhavana were the starting meditation should be in Standing, then Walking, then Sitting Meditation. However it is a great resource for learning the foundations for Meditations and building the knowledge and some Pitfalls to avoid for a learning student. A great quality material for the Book and its complimented Audio CD, your money's worth."
3,The beginnings of psychedelic Miles,"""Miles In The Sky"" follows ""Nefertiti"", and it's clear from the beginning that the sound has changed. ""Stuff"" is laid-back, and Herbie Hancock is playing an electric piano. The melody lines are fairly involved, and it's a long enough (17 minutes) song to get plenty of good playing in. ""Paraphenalia"" has George Benson playing guitar. His contributions are relatively small, though. It's a pretty decent song, though it has slightly less bite than ""Stuff"". ""Black Comedy"" is the edgiest song of the CD. ""Country Son"" is more abstract, and is my least favorite song. The music certainly isn't unpleasant, it just seems to be missing enough commitment to make it a 4-star CD. It's a transitional album, you can hear Miles evolve away from the advanced hard bop of the ""E. S. P."" through ""Nefertiti"" era and into the fusion era of ""In A Silent Way"" and ""Bitches Brew""."
5,Quite nice.,"I purchased the Coco Mango incense some time ago and should have left a review by now. I'm sure if the seller is still listing on Amazon but Auric Blends had the best price along with shipping. The incense themselves burn within 45 minutes to one hour. The smell is quite nice, not too strong and you can easily burn multiplies one after another as the smell keeps bringing you back. I recommend Coco Mango, but if it isn't from Auric Blends, that could potentially alter the scent since oils don't always come from the same buyer. They may put diluted to extend the oil, thus weakening the scent in the process. Be sure to ask this question before buying. Thank you."
5,BELLS WILL BE RINGING,"This is definitely a tear-jerker that will move you in countless ways. I laughed, cried, cheered, and as always, I disliked the bad guy. But, all in all, I loved the book, and I REALLY loved the ending. As a parent, teacher ... Lilla Belle is a wonderful book that we all need to read and learn from. As the saying goes, we're never too old to learn."
5,SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE!,"LILLA BELLE IS SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE! I BOUGHT THE BOOK WHEN I SAWTHE ADORABLE CUTIE ON THE COVER, BUT I MUST ADMIT, I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED WITH THE STORY! THIS IS DEFINITELY A GLUE BOOK! I'M A TRUE NEW YORKER, AND NEW YORK IS KNOWN AS THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS, AND LILLA BELLE IS A BOOK THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY NOT SLEEP ON! THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE STORY IS SIMPLY IRRESISIBLE!"
5,Rocafella is HERE FOR GOOD,"Jay-Z kills it on Dear Summer. The rest of the album shows you why Memphis Bleek is the next in line to Jay-z. Awesome, Awesome stuff."
2,Mediocre at best.... disappointing,"First and foremost, I'm a Bleek fan. Maybe I'm listening to a different album or something, but this is nowhere near his best album. MADE was so much more thorough, you could easily listen through that entire CD. That's not the case with this LP. The wit and depth of the lyrics aren't up to what Bleek is capable of, and there aren't any tracks that will really stick in your head all day [i.e., ""I Get High,"" ""Hustlers.""]. I find the beat to ""Oh Baby"" too annoying to listen to it twice in the same day. Bleek is at his best when he can speak clearly over a beat, and that's what you get with ""Alright"" and ""Straight Path"" - the best tracks on the CD, along with the ""534"" intro. Also, this effort being the first major release from the so-called ""New Roc"" should have been more in the ballpark of 20 tracks, even if that means that 3 of those are skits [think Cam'ron's ""Purple Haze""]."
1,PLEASE CORRECT SPELLING,THIS BOOK MEANS ALOT AND I'D LIKE TO READ THE CLASSIC FOR NOTHING.. BUT THIS COPY HAS MORE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS ISN'T FROM A KINDERGARTNER.COME ON..
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CLASSIC IN THIS EDITION!!!!,"This is not a review of the work itself.One comment only: surprisingly enough, the editor of this volume, the 'world renowned' Richard Tuck DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTES, please pay attention: the book was originally published in 1651 (or something) but nevertheless the so called Hobbes scholar does not provide scholarly notes... and this is supposed to be a 'student's edition'... ha haShame on you, Mr. Tuck!"
4,"good quality, fast shipping",this book came quickly to my place and the book was great quality as well
5,Good Coverage of Seldom Visited Rail Lines,"I believe the low ratings given above on the basis of ""prejudice"" are way off the mark. This is a DVD about TRAINS, not a scenic travelog of the prettiest sights in the countries involved. If the trains are located in unsightly areas and patronized mostly by poor people, then the photographers had no choice but to portray them accordingly. It's not as if the producers had a choice between luxury trains and run-down railroads and chose only the latter. There are plenty of videos available showing the attractive and ""touristy"" sites in the Middle East; this one is intended for a different audience."
5,Love it!!,"I love this easel. It is sturdy and can adjust up to 34"". That's really great. I also love the fact that it can adjust on the top and bottom, leaving it pretty compact. It just hangs over the table for the bigger canvas.The drawer is great! My brushes fit in it amazingly well. Even the longer ones. There's also 2 spots that will fit smaller things like pencils, erasers, sharpeners, etc.I love the quality and simplicity of this easel. No assembly required and it is easy to transport or tuck away when you're done. I highly recommend this easel. It's affordable and well made. A must have!"
5,penultimate 60's quintet,"this album, although often overlooked, is one of the many rich treasures in the miles catalog. before he started his spin-off into electric music (albeit tentatively with 'miles in the sky'),miles' career was sort of in a holding pattern, despite the fact that he was making some great music. wayne shorter had really come into his own as a composer after having established himself as an outstanding tenor saxophonist. tony williams, still only in his early 20's, was arguably the best drummer in all of music, not just jazz. the cool pensiveness offset by some very hot rhythm section fire make the albums in this series sound just as good as they did when i discovered them in high school almost 30 years ago."
3,Average,"Because of the title track, this album gets a lot more credit than it deserves. I mean, I've had it for about a year and a half, listening to it off and on, and I just don't see what all the hype is about. Nefertiti and Fall are great song. But Hand Jive, Madness, and Pinocchio are just repetitive. They all start with Miles and Wayne stating the theme. Then after that the two of them take turns soloing over Ron's Bass and Tony's drums. After a couple of minutes, it's like, ""okay, what else are you going to do?"" While all this is done for a reason, it still doesn't equal to entertaining music. But as always, try it for yourself and see."
2,Lifeless,"It's easy to understand why Billy Joel would want to release a live album at this point in his career. He had just toured the Soviet Union, and his only live album so far had been Songs In The Attic (which highlighed Joel's pre-Stranger days). Plus Billy had developed a reputation as a dazzling live performer over the years. However, the resulting product is a lifeless, synthesized performance that sucks all of the passion and character from the individual songs. The only track work hearing is a terrific cover of Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"". The rest constitutes for the least essential recording of Billy Joel's career."
5,A fovorite,"I'm completely biased, but I love this book. I love Vonnegut's writing style, and delivery. His books are timeless and parallel our own realities. I suggest him to anyone, especially those looking to determine their reading interests."
3,Easily Vonnegut's best novel.,"I have read every Vonnegut novel, from PLAYER PIANO right up to TIMEQUAKE, and I can honestly say that he is one of the most uneven writers around. For every brilliant CAT'S CRADLE there is an equally ludicrous SLAPSTICK. That being said, I believe BLUEBEARD to be his best work. The story is wonderfully involving without relying on gimmicks (like BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS), and the characters are marvellously drawn. I can also say that this novel involved me emotionally more than any other of his books. Not only do I consider it Vonnegut's best, but I would probably rate it among my personal favorites. Compelling and touching."
5,I would definitely recommend this product to everyone! ...,"I would definitely recommend this product to everyone! Not only does it go on smoothly without pulling on the skin, but it stays on for quite a long time and comes off pretty easily. I will stick with this one for sure! I am very glad that you turned me on to this product."
3,Serviceable Thriller,"Diverting, but otherwise routine thriller set in the fast-paced world of the stock market. Although most of the characters are morally bankrupt, fortunately the film has a clear moral center. This saves the film from being trash. The relationships between the guys are good, but the romantic subplot involving Ribisi and Long lacks chemistry. Ben Affleck is good in what is essentially a supporting role."
2,White Collar Goodfellas,"First off, let me start by saying that this movie has one of the worst endings I have seen in a really long time, nothing is resolved. Giovanni Ribisi has a ton of talent but it is wasted on this convoluted script which has no direction and takes the viewer nowhere. Ben Affleck is great as the company's pitchman but his appearances are few and far between, as are Vin Diesel's. Nia Long's part is completely wasted and has no bearing on the plot whatsoever. The relationship between Ribisi and his father is ridiculous. So basically the only thing that makes this movie good is watching these sharks in action. The movie contains some great one-liners and the action on the floor is key. But overall, the narration is taken right from Goodfellas 101 as is the camera work on some of the more violent scenes. I mean seriously any movie whose key quote was penned by the Notorious BIG is trying really hard not to be taken seriously."
4,Everyone in sales should see this as a boot camp training for what closing is all about,"We done, well acted and overall what a shark tank looks like. If you can possible gleam some good out of their corruption, you might learn a thing or two about closing. THE MOVIE IS GREAT!"
5,A Great Movie! U have to see it!,"Hello readers! Want to see a great movie full of new Star talent? Then see Boiler Room! It stars Giovanni Ribisi (The Other Sister, The Postman, Saving Private Ryan), Vin Diesel (Strays, Saving Private Ryan, Pitch Black), and Ben Affleck (Dogma, Armageddon, Shakespeare In Love)! Ribisi plays Seth, a collage drop out who is hungry to make the big bucks. Driven by greed he foolishly joins a firm and learn the brooker biz. At the firm he meets the other brookers, like Chris (Vin Diesel), who are men barely out out of their twenties who have become millionars! A story of greed, disillusionment and redemption, this is a great movie to see! If you have any questions then please feel free to email me (NikkiD84@hotmail.com)! Later!"
4,Good movies,I bought this movie for my husband a few Christmas ago thinking he liked this movie. But he never saw this movie before. I played it for us and we both found something better to do. Now here we are a few years later. I played it last night and my husbands eyes were stuck to the tv. He enjoyed this movie. Since I went to sleep because of work this morning I didn't get to finish the movie last night. So after work I played Boiler Room and I enjoyed it. We both should have gave it a change when I bought it years ago.
4,Boiler Plate,"A great look into how some small brokerages mold their brokers. Not all of course are shady as portrayed in this movie. Fans of movies about Wallstreet should enjoy it. Great cast like Giovanni Ribisi and includes good support from Vin Diesel and many others. This and ""Wallstreet"" are two of the best you will see about the area of New York that creates or ruins fortunes everyday.When a young man is not satisfied with college he strikes out on his own by running a gambling casino in his apartment. He is eventually approached by a man running a small stock brokerage and he decides he will go legit to please his dad, a judge. At first all seems well but then he begins to find out the brokerage firm is not as legit as he first thought."
4,"Really fun movie, well done, well acted","This highlights another aspect of the rough and tumble world of Wall Street.It is interesting, fast moving, and well acted."
1,If you value your time...,"steer clear. This movie suffers from terminal SCS... Shaky Camera Syndrome, the latest thing nowadays to make a movie look cool. Not only does that leave you disturbed physically, but it distracts you from what could be crucial elements of the story, such as Giovanni Ribisi's family history, which they also manage to screw up, leaving you really not caring if he wins or loses in the end. Pile on top of that the awful acting and the extremely poor casting choices of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, and you have a waste of time.As for Giovanni Ribisi, he's ok in this movie, but go buy/rent Heaven with him and Cate Blanchett."
1,Just read some lyrics before you buy it ..............,"Their sound is good, but the lyrics alternate between very vacuous and very dark. And unfortunately Dominique's voice makes the dark ones sound vacuous. For a taste of vacuous lyrics, from ""You Don't Know Anything"" comes this, ""I know you're barely human but I can get something better"". Or if you want to descend to the inane, try ""Ba Ba Ba"".I've heard some good songs from them, but not on this album."
5,w00t! I love Bones!,Great series. I love Bones! I was a little disappointed that pre-ordering this meant I had to wait a week after it was in stores. But I'm just glad I have it now.
1,I paid 99 cents for this one..?,"If I had wanted to watch an entirely different show than Bones, I would have watched it. Instead I wasted a good thirty minutes when Seely and Temperence were not on screen, and skipped over the weird amalgam of characters that someone thought might be interesting. I want fifty of my ninety-nine cents back..."
3,I Hope It Gets Stronger (Not to Mention Funnier) Than This,"This was a very soft and fuzzy Bones episode. The gang is all brought together again by attorney Caroline to save the medical coroner's job. Everybody is very huggy, feely with one another and a body is resolved although it is definitely in second place in the episode. The personal issues take precedence. Bones and Booth still look in unrequited love to me although Booth met a new girlfriend while on duty abroad. Absolutely no comedy in this episode, which is what I miss the most from the earlier seasons."
5,Bones S6 review.,"Blu-Ray offers excellent picture, good quality HD, and packed with bonus features. I was able to get the box set for an extremely reasonable price (cheap in fact), and it was shipped to me in record time. Only took 3 days when it was anticipated to take 7-10 business days!"
5,Just Buy It!,"If you're a fan of Miles Davis, you probably already have this one. If you're not familiar with Davis, or just don't already have it, Miles Smiles is an absolute necessity if you like your jazz straight-up and cooking.I like all the recordings I've heard of this Quintet, but Miles Smiles really gets the essence of the incredible rapport these musicians had, in a studio setting. The music here is very ""visual"", like a master's painting or classic movie. At times floating like a feather on the wind, at times moody and edgy. After first hearing this one almost twenty years ago, I still find myself picking up on additional nuances and details in this one.Shawn"
5,This album is an outburst of creativity and genius...,"Everytime I hear this album, I ask myself the same question...how the hell did they record every piece in one take, and STILL improvise every solo, fiddle with the tempo, and create one of the greatest records Jazz music will ever see?I still can't understand, and I still can't 'digest' this record... these guys must have been possessed...This album is really hot jazz, the solos are impressive, and Tony Williams and Ron Carter just take it everywhere...they play as if they communicated telepathically or something. The rest of the group just rides the crest of a wave of cymbals and thumping bass. Definitely a must."
1,A pathetic work of tabloid quality,"It always amazes me how publishers agree to accept books on Islam written by cheap characters with absolutely no insight into the world of Islam. If the western world is the measure of gender equality, I wonder why US was never able to produce any influential women in its history [presidents, vice presidents etc] while it is always embarrasing for westerners to explain howcome the majority of women leaders in the world are actual muslim women [Megawati, Vice President of Indonesia, Sheik Hasina and Khalida Zia, Prime Ministers of Bangladesh, Benazir Bhutto, PM of Pakistan, Massumeh Ebtekar, vice president of Iran and Tansu Ciller, Prime Minister of Turkey!"
1,Please do not buy this book!,"I am a muslim woman and very proud of it. The writer has no respect for the religion, and did not even try to understand the culture! Many westerners could find this book entertaining, it confirms all the stereotypes, but everything is relative in life, and this is what is hard for the Americans to see, because their only beleive if that the way to be is the American way!I am an engineer in an American company, I disliked this book very much eventhought I am not a fanatic (some reviewers claimed that only the fanatics dislikes this book)There are many exellent books written by MUSLIM women on MUSLIM women... Please read those and not this one!I have seen 100 times more non-muslim women complaining about Islam, than muslim women... Thanks for complaining for us... we do not need it!"
4,Interesting look at Islam women's lives,"I am a Brooks fan and this didn't disappoint. It is an interesting look at the lives of several Muslim women. I was surprised to find that it is the younger and sometimes well educated women who are sometimes embracing the veil and fundamentalist views.Brooks included a variety of women's stories, from those who embrace the fundamentalist views to more liberal women, including a police chief.She shows respect for the religion's history which initially gave women more rights. However, she also says the religion has changed from Mohammed's time when his first wife was a business woman to one that has ""proved such fertile ground for almost every anti-woman custom it encountered in its great march out of Arabia."" She says it needs to be accountable for that."
4,A great book on Women in Islam,"A very interesting read for anyone interested in the cause of women in Islam. Some might find it biased - the author makes her opinion very clear and her view is not impartial.However, she makes some very good parallels between the situation in the Prophet's time and what it is today - and this is not a pretty picture. The testimonials of women is various countries of the Middle East are very enlightening and some make the situation of women in those countries very frightening. It is also interesting to see some of these women's view towards their culture, their society and the progress made by Muslim women.It is probably one of the best book, if not the best book I have read on women in Islam and I highly recommend it."
3,Fairly Balanced,"Brooks makes no secret of her own opinions about many of the oppressive practices women in the Middle East endure. That said, she allows them to tell their stories with limited interference. She does what most authors fail to do - allow the diversity of opinion and beliefs of Muslim women shine through. Never does she overgeneralize. As with any book about Muslim culture, readers must attempt to extract the story from the bias of the author. It's well written, easy to understand and read, and leaves you with the desire and resources to explore more on your own."
1,Absurd.,"People need to know the difference between patriarchal cultures/societies and religion. What the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was teaching was to break ties with burying daughters alive, fornication, adultry and other degrading actions for both males and females. This book depicts outraged emotions of a feminist who is portraying the status of women in Islam as low and worthless. Yes, backward societies do degrade women, but not Islam. I am an American Muslim woman who is fascinated with her beautiful religion, one that protects women and gives them just rights. Thank you very much."
3,Gave Me Insight,"This book introduced me to the Islamic view of women--although, I must admit, I have no real context for Islam. Generally, the view is foreign to me. But I appreciate that this book attempts to give me understanding of an unfamiliar culture.I'm interested in different religions and culture, and consequently I found the book interesting. It wasn't preachy, I found it easy to read.I'd like to read a more in-depth book about the Islam, especially the role of women."
4,balanced and broad,"I enjoyed this book because of the wide view of Islamic women it portrayed. From reports of the Taliban and books like ""Princess Sultana's Daughters"", we hear of very restrictive regimes where women are oppressed. Geraldine Brooks shows us that many women choose the veil, and that there are many different kinds of Islam.I also enjoyed the chapters on women in Islamic texts, and where the traditions evolved from."
4,Universal questions and a unique life...,"This is a book I could never before have read with an open mind.Fifteen years ago, I'd have dismissed Ner-David as an apologist for Orthodoxy, trying to cram modern sensibilities into a hopelessly outdated mold. Ten years ago, during my own tumultuous ""return,"" I'd have sneered at her willingness to entertain thoughts of mixed seating, uncovered hair and egalitarian prayer.It's only now, I think, that I'm ready to hear the honest questions Ner-David and others like her are asking and to understand that the Judaism we share is resilient enough to answer to -- and thrive from -- challenge and diversity.Ner-David's narrative, interwoven with threads dealing with her own physical frailty, tells a story not of a senseless rebellion against Orthodoxy but of a young woman's awakening to a deeper, more genuine love of her tradition.I wish Ms Ner-David a Yasher Kocheich -- may she never stop asking."
1,Don't waste your money,"My first mandoline was a V Slicer, which I was very happy with. I bought the Matfer because I liked the stand, which was my only complaint with the V Slicer. I found the blade to be extremely dull from the start. It tears apart everything from tomatoes to onions. You can get the V Slicer for about $30.00 so don't waste your money on the Matfer!"
1,Terrible,"I used one of the cheaper plastic mandolines for years and while it worked well, I thought this more expensive one would be superior. I bought it and after two weeks have given it away to the Salvation Army. It is a terrible product: heavy, difficult to use, difficult to store, difficult to clean and dangerous. The old inexpensive light plastic one fits nicely over a mixing bowl; this one is difficult to collect sliced food. Save your money and buy one of the far cheaper light plastic ones."
3,Baby G needs a degree to set,It is more than a notion to think that you can set this watch. It automatically set the time but there are so many options that you can't just set it and put it on. I like the watch so I kept it but unfortunately I am only using 1/4 of the watch because I haven't made time to read the manual that came with the watch.
4,My opinion,It seems to give me more energy that I need and that is what I wanted. I mainly bought it for that reason. I wanted the extra boost in my day and it seems to be working with out any uncomfortable side affects. I am satisfied.
2,Disappointed,"If you like Dave Hood and Becky in the other ""There Goes A..."" series, then you'll be disappointed with this one. I felt deceived because they had the name ""Dave"" on the box and showed a very small photo of a guy dressed like Dave usually dresses, but it's a different Dave and he doesn't do as good a job as Dave Hood. I thought he was awful. My son still likes the video because of the substance (i.e., the machinery), but I felt cheated."
1,Where is the real Dave???,"My son loves the ""There goes a"" video series, especially the humor of Dave and sometimes Becky. He was really excited to watch this new video until he realized Dave, the old Dave, had been replaced. What a disappointment. I guess it's the older videos for us."
3,"Not as good as the ""real"" Dave, but kids don't care","We have ALL of the ""There Goes"" series, and my kids (ages 2 and 4) were thrilled to have a new one to watch. They did want to know where the ""real Dave"" was, but still enjoy watching all the farm machinery in action. I do miss the emphasis on safety that the ""real Dave"" usually has...tractors (and especially the tools they pull) are very dangerous. As are the fertilizers and pesticides shown sprayed from the helicopter. This tape makes no mention of the hazards on the farm, and I wish it did. Still, it's entertaining and educational, and does get across some of the work involved in producing food. I wouldn't make this the first ""There goes a..."" tape I bought for my kids, but it's a good addition to a collection if your kids are fascinated by anything containing a combustion engine."
3,Good Footage Ruined by Terrible Music,"This video has some excellent footage but the TERRIBLE music (it was made in 1999 but imagine the most awful, cheesy corporate music of the 80s) and the COMPLETELY lifeless voice of the narrator greatly diminish the viewing experience. I bought it to show my 7th grade students but the music is so beyond bad that I know better than to try to capture their attention with it. It's too bad because some of the footage is worthwhile."
5,"A part of TX so pretty it's the ""smiling country"" to Hewey.","Too often sequels are a dud. Not so with Elmer Kelton's follow-up to ""The Good Old Boys."" Hewey Calloway is 4 years removed from leaving Spring Renfro, but he hasn't wised up much or changed his ways. But things are a changin' around him. And, if fact, Hewey IS changing--he's getting older if not wiser. Will Hewey wise up--about his lifestyle and about Spring before it's too late? Kelton tells us in his own remarkable style."
2,Great But...,"I really like the tracks on this album.. uh.. until about 1 or 2 minutes into each peice. The drummer could not be more in the way, more annoying, rambunctious, out of balance and out of place after a minute or two into almost every track. There are only a couple of tracks where this isn't the case. Granted, a drum solo is fine from time to time, but this is rediculus. Wanting some nice music to relax or have playing in the background while company is over, this album does NOT work. Ok, so maybe thats not it's purpose, but still, no thanks. Maybe it looked cooler in person with arms flailing faster than the eye can perceive."
2,Not even worth 2 stars but...,"It's got great eye candy in it with Kerr Smith(Jack from of Dawson's Creek) and Brendan Fehr(Michael from of Roswell)other then that,the movie [wasn't good].I mean,you ever heard of a vampire with no fangs?Rent The Lost Boys,Blade1+2,Queen Of The Damned and Interview With The Vampire other then this for your vampire kick."
1,What is this?,"This movie is god awful. Aside from Izabella Miko showing some skin (hence one star), there is nothing to look forward to in this movie.The directing is crappy quick edits and the actors are all anoying. Brendan Fehr almost came close to amusing but failed in the end. The people who played the vampires are lame as can be. The story is, well....a snooze fest.I enjoy a good B movie to bad this isn't one.....Rent this one for the nudity if that gets you stake (pun inteended) shaken if not....pass it an don't look back."
3,Okay sketch comedy from some very talented people,"Noticeably watered-down sketch comedy (thanks ABC). The few times the show was controversial (e.g. the Bill Clinton breast-feeding sketch), it felt more like a gimmick than a statement. Some gems can be found throughout, though, and if you love Dana Carvey, then you'll love his show."
2,Sinking In The River,"River Of Dreams is the last studio album Billy Joel has released and by the sound of it, maybe that's not such a bad thing. Mr. Joel has always made highly listenable, superb pop-rock records, but on River Of Dreams, he tries to go down the Paul Simon, world beat route. The title track is plainly just a horrible song and the worst thing he has ever done. ""Lullabye"" is a nice idea, a song for his daughter, but it comes across as contrived. The album is saved a one-star rating by the excellent ""Blonde Over Blue"" and the pulsating ""All About Soul"", but other than those two thealbum fails to live up to his previous works."
5,"New idea, but great album.","This is not exactly the right album for fans of Billy Joel, for the style doesn't seem right compared with his earlier efforts. However, this is a good album for music lovers. With songs ranging from gospel to hard rock, and equipped with a trace of piano playing on one of the best tracks, Billy has made his last album a stylish departure."
4,Very Entertaining and Informative,This is the only book on cryptography I have read so I haven't much to compare it to. It was written in a rather light style (maybe too light at certain times) but maintained a steady pace. I was particularly interested in Singh's chapter on modern public key cryptography and the discovery that assymetrical functions could be used as encryption/decryption keys. A good book that's easy to understand throughout.
4,Z3 by Konrad Zuse was the first programmable computer(1941),"A common error occurs in the book: not ENIGMA(USA 1945) as most people believe, not COLOSSUS(UK 1943) as Singh claims, but Z3(Germany 1941) has been the first programmable computer. If you come to Munich, you can see a rebuilt of this maschine in the ""Deutsche Museum"".Some militairs were interested to use it for cryptography as well but it did not come to such an application in WW2.Some technical data of Z3: 2000 relais, floating point arithmetic (22 Bit), memory: 64 wordsVelocity: 3 seconds for multiplication, division or square root"
4,Thoroughly fascinating,"""The Code Book"" is a highly interesting account of cryptology through the ages. Mr. Singh is a very talented writer, most evident in the first chapter where he explains the roots of cryptography and cryptanalysis while tieing it all to Mary, Queen of Scots. His explanations of code/cipher methods are very easy to understand. The only part that was questionable was his narrative about quantum computers and ciphers. It seemed a bit over-zealous, but it still provided interesting food for thought. The chapters devoted to Enigma were most excellent! I highly recommend this book to anyone with any interest in this topic."
4,"Good reading, even if you're not mathematically confident","Like many nerdy types, I've been interested in codes and ciphers since adolescence -- in my case, the mid-1950s. Being also a history junkie, in high school I read Chadwick's The Decipherment of Linear B, and in college, Tuchman's The Zimmerman Telegram, which confirmed my interest. (Both are covered here.) I picked up this book on a recommendation from a friend because of the accessible discussion of more recent topics, including ""Pretty Good Privacy"" and quantum cryptography, and while I found it necessary to skim lightly over some of the mathematical explanations, Singh's straightforward style and mastery of his subject made for an enjoyable weekend."
1,Faulty size,"Don't know if the fault lies with Amazon or the Seller but although I was assured by Amazon's ""This product fits"" my application it did NOT in fact fit. Way off and of course I was I outside of my 30 day return period as the shipping on my rotors was delayed and did not try and install these pads until 37 days after placing an order. :(I would't trust the fit application (verify the part numbers for your vehicle elsewhere) but if you must trust Amazon's fit be sure and check the fit within 30 days to avoid being stuck with brake pads you can't use. (I ended up going with a pair of ceramic brake pads from Autozone that cost about 40% the cost of these)"
5,Billy at his best.,"This album and ""52nd Street"" are my two favorite Billy Joel albums. They both have variety and vitality and I consider them to be his finest works. The reason I mention ""52nd St."" here is because it's necessary to have both albums to adequately cover his phenomenal range."
4,Written From The Soul,"I really appreciate all of Billy Joel's records. However his early releases: Cold Spring Harbor, Turnstiles, and this one are special probably because they are not so overplayed on the radio. The title track is so haunting its beautiful. Los Angelinos boogies along quite nicely as Billy's band adds nice support. And two instrumentals- the subdued Mexican Connection with its accentuated rhythms and the jolly bingo hall styled Root Beer Rag. The Entertainer may be the hit single with its catchy lyrics but overall this record is very consistent and quite varied."
3,Probably best for my fellow Billy collectors,"I enjoyed this album, but it isn't in my regular CD rotation. The songs are mostly good piano works, but nothing really grabs attention. The big exception is ""The Entertainer"" which could be one of his top 5 tracks of all time. If you're buying Billy for the first time, start with ""The Stranger"" or ""Turnstiles"", this gem you won't get into until you've been other Joel-places first."
5,All You Need is,"Depardieu and Ardant are paired in this movie, and not for the last time, and produce a grotesque story of obsession between former and now reunited lovers. Ardant's character is married, and her older, boring husband is beginning to suspect that she has feelings for another man.If you conclude from this movie that the French are so much in love with being in love that they are not outraged even when love kills, I won't argue with you. ""The Woman Next Door"" is about forbidden love and fatal attraction. It is a movie about two people who are lost in the world without love, but who cannot love in this world."
3,Too much cost,"The price at $22.49 is out of line. I would buy all three at around 13 or 14 dollars each. Right now, I can watch them all on Netflix for my monthly cost, which is less than $22.49.The cost of a music CD to replicate is about 18 cents. The cost to replicate a video CD is about 50 cents.Check it out, dude."
5,A Classy Piece,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the tray when I received it (via US friends) and it is a classy addition to ""happy hour"" in our home in the Middle East! Well worth the effort and expense to get."
4,"You get what you pay for, Excellent performance for a price.","It works exactly as you would expect it to once you have purchased the tool, blade guide, blade and roller footplate. This whole package costs $400+, but if you need this level of performance the cost is negligible.The Good:-Tool starts and stops smoothly with minimal vibration.-Smooth and even cutting, with perfectly smooth edges for many different foam types.-Footplate accessory (sold seprately)quickly and easily detaches and re-attaches for perfectly perpendicular cuts.The Bad:-Difficult to align the blade guide for attachment.-Cord could be longer-Does not include any blade guides or blades-Cost"
1,Disc didn't play,"I was really excited to finally get to see the movie Five Corners again, I saw it many years ago and loved it so when I received this disk I put it in the DVD player right away and about 25 minutes into the movie it locked up. I took out the disk and noticed it was scratched. I couldn't get it to play...very disappointed."
1,I hate it,Nobody in my family likes clowns . We don't watch them. You may like them but we don't.See for yourself
1,Not worth Renting,"This movie looks like it has great potential, but quickly goes downhill. I would save myself the $1.99 to rent this movie and instead buy a cup of coffee to enjoy as you sit back and watch the evening news."
2,Great cover - mediocre story line.,"The cover picture is awesome. The movie started off good, but veered into a different direction. The story line is not for everyone, though I am sure there are a few that will take interest to it."
5,good,This is one of my brothers favorite movies. I had to get it for him. They don't make movies like they use to.
5,Awsome Movie,I love wrestling i seen it a lont time ago and I've been looking for this movie and now i finally got it and i still love it if your a wrestling fan buy this you are gonna love this movie
2,You have to be a wrestling fan to like this stuff,"Lots of foul words...lots of wrestling moves...CAUTION: Never watch it with kids around& yeah, you have to be an avid wrestling fan to appreciate this kind of movie"
2,ready to rumble,Ready to Rumble is the dumbest act of uncivilized humor since Dumb and Dumber. It's alright but I wouldn't buy it I'd record it. The plot is 2 Jimmy the King fans go crosscountry to find him that's about it. I'm done so buy.
4,thin spatula,"When I first saw this I thought it looked thin and not very durable. It is very hard plastic and looks like it was pressed right out of a mold. But it works fine for small items like eggs. Don't try to flip a burger, though, it will fall right off the side."
5,Never thought a spatula could be this good,"Never doubt the power of great design to make a lasting difference in your everyday life. This particular spatula is evidence of that. Lightweight but the perfect size and so far it has been more durable than I expected.__________________The only downside is that this $11 item cost $8 to ship! I'll check Bed, Bath, & Beyond first on similar small items from now on. (Anyone else notice that Amazon is increasingly backing away from its Free Shipping benefit by not carrying more items these days?)"
5,great!,great item! I use it all the time to stir almost everything I cook. Pretty easy to clean (compared to other non-stick spatulas that I have).
3,Spaghetti And Cheese,"This is the cheesiest movie I ever watched, but I did watch it from beginning to end. It takes place in Florida but all the actors are Italian. If you can imagine a ""spaghetti crime drama"" then you are in the right ball park."
2,Great Price But ... Poor Quality is No Deal,"Everything was just fine until I tightened the laces for the first time. When the roller style guide pulled out of the boot it left a nice hole clean through the shell, about half way up the boot. So much for water proofing."
1,Very disappointing,"Part 2 seemed to be an attempt to capitalize on the success of the original and, like so many sequels, fell far short of the mark. The integrity of the filmmaker is called into question with an inappropriate romance between Billy's sister and his childhood nemesis in addition to the repeated loss of his dog (only one of the new pair died this time). The replacement of the actor who played the grandfather, while possibly unavoidable, was a serious mistake also."
2,"Bad, bad, bad","This movie never should have been made. The original story had a satisfying ending and that was the way it was meant to be. This movie had a poor story line and bad acting. None of the characters are very lovable, particularly the dogs. Skip this one and stick with the original. It's not worth the $5.00."
2,Poor excuse of a video,"I am a HUGE Wilson Rawls fan. There was no attempt to make a quality video here. The cuts throughout the video were grade-school at the least. If someone would have just taken the time to edit and make sure the sound was right, this would have been a pretty good video. Mr. Rawls is howling from his grave!"
2,Where the Red Fern Grows 2,If you are looking for something you can watch with your whole family including younger children this is NOT it. The story line was OK but there was at least 3 unnecessary and rough kissing scenes with the younger sister and Billy's friend. I don't know why they think we have to see this in movies. Besides that the story was OK but not nearly as good as the first one.
4,Some what better than Part I,"Ok, some people may completely disagree that this is better than Part I but I can't stand the first one. Its WAY to sad and depressing, not to say it isn't worth seeing if you havn't seen it yet. ""Where the Red Fern Grows 2"" is years after the first one and Billy is now returning home after fighting in World War II. His grandpa (Wilford Brimley) suprises him with two red-bone hounds just like the ones he had when he was a boy. At first he doesn't accept them but finally takes them to train them to track down racoons. Has a little bit of humor and is to a point more mature than the first. Even though you won't be able to hold back tears at the end, you will treasure this classic later on and come back to see it again and again. A must-have."
2,Not as good as the first movie.,Bought this movie because I have the first one and was hoping that it would be just as good. Unfortunately the second movie lacked interest in the character unlike the first one. The second movie both my husband and I were dissappointed and we wish we had just skipped this one. But we have it and will remain with the first movie as a set. This is a don't mess with perfection thing. It should have just been ended after the first movie.
5,A good story put in a children's novel,"I first picked up Patriots' Gold while visiting my grandfather. I loved the book so much I stayed up all night reading it. It is definatly a page turner. Even though it is a ""children's book"" don't let this stop you from reading a very interesting story. Historical fiction books may not be true but the make certain parts of history come alive for us and also gives us insight on how people acted in that time period. So, if you ever happen to stumble upon Patriots' Gold don't hesitate to read it."
5,Guy Buffet - The Martini Magician,"Im gonna cut to the chase. Im crazy about Martini. Vodka Martinis, Dry Martini, Martini and Red Bull...the lot. But finding the perfect Martini suite plates to compliment an ice-cool Martini spritzer on the rocks had always been a nightmare, until I stumbled across the Guy Buffet Martini Suite Plates. The designs on these beauties are simply exquisite. Vive le Revolution!"
4,Really works!,This is nice cuticle cream. I just wish it didnt smell like baby powder! I would have used it multiple times a day but the smell was too much.
3,Lack lustre attempt,"I have read a few of the reviews and feel the most important aspect about BTs progression with this album is a continuation towards the mainstream market. Let's face it IMA and ESCM were brilliant but were for the more underground ambiant/trance market. With Movement in Still Life and now this album he is marketing himself to the mainstream...which ended up pretty good on MiSL but this album is just weak. The only reason I give 3 stars is for a few great songs. Like Moby, BT has found there is more money outside of the where their true passion lies."
3,Good but...,"I like some tracks on this; but I'm finding it hard to listen to them over and over. As it is, most of the tracks on this album will require extensive remixes before they hit the club floors.BT's earlier stuff was definitely better, much less vocals and amazing harmonies and melodies. There are other people out there (listen to Butterfly Trip by Astral Projection!) who IMO do this kind of stuff better albeit much faster and maybe a little more synthetic."
2,What is this crap?,"I loved Movement in Still Life, and I have enjoyed many of BT's other works. He is a very talented artist - but this CD is crap.Everything blends together - it sounds like he put all of his other work in a blender and spewed this horrible piece from it."
4,"BT is excellent as always, but this one left me wanting more","I have been an avid BT fan for a long time now and always anxiously await his new releases. ET has been a long time coming and much has changed. He has continued in the direction of the US Movement in Still Life release, giving us more actual concise songs than the long, trancey meditations we have loved for all these years. It has a mixed result as some songs are excellent (Dark Heart Dawning) while others are interesting, but not quite what we're used to (Superfabulous). I like the longer jams of the past, citing Movement in Still Life (Import) and ESCM as my favorites, but this album is still rewarding in its own way. It shows that BT is as good a singer/songwriter as he is a composer/producer/arranger. Shine on BT."
1,Ick,"This was disappointingly bad; The new haircut should have been a tip-off; ""The Great Escape"" was the only track I could listen to more than once. It's fine if he wants to appeal to a different audience, but if your idea of good BT is ""Mercury and Solace,"" then you need not go here."
4,BT back to vocals A+++,"I really enjoyed the album. It is on my list of top BT albums, It reminds me of how I felt when I first heard Movement in Still life. Good vocals, good samples and hooks. I especially like the song w/ rose mcgowan, and the current single ""Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist)"" is REALLY good!!!!Most of the songs have vocals, which some peopel think he has sold out becuase of it, but I really enjoyed it. I persoanlly love IMA as an album the best cause I can listen to it in any mood, but this one really ranks up on my top list.It is funny, here this CD JUST got released, I can't wait for a new BT cd."
3,Electronic artists should not do vocals,"BT obviously knows his way around electronics instruments. Unfortunately the interesting things he does -- or more likely: could do -- disappear under pretty mediocre vocals on this disc. None of the singers on this disc are bad, himself included, but they are not good either. The melodies are forgettable, the lyrics sometimes toe-curlingly bad. This guy needs someone to keep him in line, because this ""written, played, sung, produced, recorded, arranged, engineered by BT"" trip is not working."
3,"A couple good tracks, but probably the worst BT album","Judging this based on 2012 listening experience:I've just rediscovered BT after being a big fan in the late 90s, early 2000s. I've been going through all his albums and have all of them on my playlist right now. This CD stands out as pretty mediocre sandwiched in between ""Movement in Still life"" ""Rare and Remixed"" and then the phenomenal ""These Hopeful Machines"". I mean it's not a terrible album. A few of the tracks are quite good. It's just that compared to the high bar he set with nearly all his other albums, this one is just not quite there."
5,A God Amongst Men,"I can't say enough about how GREAT this CD is. These songs are so chock full of interesting sounds you'll be listening to it for years before you've heard everything there is to hear. All of his fans who complained when he hooked up with JC Chasez of NSYNC are going to have to swallow there pride after they hear ""The Force of Gravity"" and ""Somnambulist"" - they're outstanding. Just one listening to ""Paris"" while reading how it was recorded on the Eurorail (listen to the train and thunder sounds - they're in there) should give you a sense of how unique this guy is. BT is a league of his own and everyone will be running to catch up to where he's taken electronic music yet again."
5,best ever???????,"This is by far Bt's most lyrical album in my opinion to date. I really appreciate the lyrics in this album as it seems to be a bit darker than most of his other songs. Athough the lyrics are not dark per se they seem to deal with breaking up here is a couple of lines from ""The Force of Gravity"" : Remember the words/ we used to speak / the promises made / have turned to all apologies. And in the ""Dark Heart Dawning"" : and in the age of love / you came and split my heart / and in the rage of love / you taught the joy in pain. That is just a taste of what the lyrics are like and believe me the songs are very well written. BT does the vocals on some of the tracks which i think is great. The tempo of this cd should be considered chillout but most of the songs are progressive which leads to some uptempo beats later on in the tracks. Overall i cannot recommend this cd enough for people who enjoy BT's work. This cd should be considered a classic soon enough"
2,Monkey see monkey do,"As a teacher, this is not teaching but regurgitating . I am. Not teaching my child this just as I don't teach my students this crap."
4,"Solid Philosophy, but there are much better choices for delivery!","I really enjoyed reading this book because it was my first time hearing about infant literacy. However, I quickly got over the excitement when I realized exactly how much work it would entail for me as a parent. The philosophy is sound, I just don't have time to cut up all that poster board and create flashcards nightly. In my parental laziness, I hunted around online and found there are a few programs that offer Doman-Inspired teaching but with none of the bother in making homemade materials. My favorite is the Little Reader software that flashes words Doman-style but also includes pictures, audio, and video. If you like Doman, you'll find this is a much more do-able, modern adaptation. Both of my kiddos were sight reading by 13 months and phonetically decoding by 19 months, you can see some footage on my TeachingMyToddlers youtube page or blog, along with a discount code."
3,"good movie, bad ending.","This movie was good up until the end. It left me saying... ""eh? That's the end?!?"" And might I add Mr. Wahlberg (and I don't mean ""Boogie Nights"" Wahlberg...I mean ""please don't go girl"" Wahlberg) was simply delightful... he didn't make a great goth guy, but he was delightful."
2,Spare Me The Kaufman-esque Jokes,"Coming off the two finest performances of his career in The Truman Show and Man on the Moon, Jim Carrey seems intent on wasting his incredible dramatic talents on this tripe. In what seems like a Kaufman-esque joke on his audience Carrey reverts back to his Ace Ventura form as a split personality, so misrepresented, so misdiagnosed that I wonder if the writers bothered to pick up a medical book in researching this. The physical comedy begins as passive state trooper Charlie transforms into an agressive ultra-ego, Hank. Don't get me wrong, this leads to a few good laughs but the movie gets bogged down about a half hour in as Charlie sets out to return a pretty young thing (Zellweger) to face trumped up hit-and-run charges made by her ex-boyfriend to get her back. Think There's Something About Mary minus it's eduring characters and you've got a farce barely worth your time on cable television."
3,Derangedly Good,"We all need some off-the-wall once in awhile. This movie is that for sure. Jim Carrey is at his best as a duel personality state policeman. The fact his three black sons are characters themselves adds to the fun. Mix in a mostly down to Earth woman trying to escape an insensitive man and you have a overall enjoyable comedy. At first I thought this movie was okay and didn't think past renting it. Since then I have had a chance to see parts of it on TV again and reflect on it a little more. This is one that will stand the test of time and I think be one of those comedy gems like Danny Kaye did in his chalice from the palace routine in ""The Court Jester"". So if you are a fan of Jim Carrey I suggest you add this one to your collection. Good quality DVD with great replayability."
4,A very interesting comedy,How does this movie only get 3 out of 5 when it is one of his classic movies he plays a Paranoid Schitrzophrenic with Split Personality wich would officially never happen but still.He beats him self up and stuff not Dumb and Dumber but still he does some great acting in this and should get some creditActing 10 Story 6 Direction 7 Action 9 Entertainment 9Overall=41/50 wich definantly means 4 stars a nice movie
2,Slap happy Carey goes off the tracks in this one.,Charlie/Hank (Jim Carey) tries his best in this dual role but I guess his best isn't good enough. Tony Cox steals the movie as the vertically challenged nunchuck wielding limo driver who beats the daylights out of Charlie on his wedding day.
3,Typical Carrey...Predictable!!!,"This is a typical Carrey movie, but not one of his better films. Renee Zellweger is great as always! The movie has a lot of funny stuff in it but falls short of being anything but a movie made up as it went along. The movie becomes tedious after a point and I began hoping the end was near. A funny film at times and would be enjoyed by die-hard Carrey fans...all others need not apply."
1,Absolutely horrid. Deserves 0 stars.,"This is a perfect example of movies I loathe. It's crude, rude, stupid, and that's just off the top of my head! There were many parts in this movie where things could have been changed to be a little cleaner, such as his three sons. I thought the concept of the three boys growing up to be geniuses was great, but then the directors had to make them cuss every few seconds. I don't shy away from cussing (I do it myself quite a bit sometimes), but it IS possible to carry on a conversation without using every single cuss word in the English language. I realize the premise of the film was for Hank to be the exact opposite of Charlie; they still could have found a way to make the movie less idiotic. Will not ever watch this movie again."
1,For junior high boys,"As I watched this disaster of a movie I kept wondering for whom it was made and concluded that the director had aimed for the 12-year old boy who was not too bright. But 12-year olds, in theory, were not permitted to see it because of the R rating. So where does that leave the movie?The supposed humor is bathroom, racist, stupid and repetitive. The plot is simply a long chase for reasons that are murky. The movie insults blacks, albinos, police, and Renee Zellweger. And all those who watch the movie, I might add.Jim Carrey has made some fine movies, ""The Truman Show,"" for example, and Zellweger has done likewise, ""Chicago,"" for example. Didn't either of these two good actors know ""Me, Myself and Irene"" was an abomination when they first read the script? Or when they were making it?"
4,Funnnnny,"This is one of Jim Careys funniest movies...a little raunchy, not for young kids or those easily offended by language."
2,better luck next time,"In fairness to Jimm Carey, he has always delighted everyone with his performance that is far beyond anybody's capability, but this movie failed him miserably. The plot, content, and story were crued, vulgar, not to mention downright ridiculously absurd. The cast and the crew were poorly defined ,shallow, inappropriate. In the end, even a Jim carey cannot resurrect a movie that is suppose to be funny and entertaining. Better luck next time Jim."
3,Quite okay,"""Me, Myself & Irene"" is a typical Farrelly-Brothers movie. Jim Carrey plays a friendly police trooper called Charlie, who is left by his wife. For 18 years he lives a normal life, but then he freaks out and his evil alter-ego Hank appears. Too bad that this just happens when Charlie has to escort the cute Irene (Renée Zellweger) to another state.This movie is a mixture of the Farrelly classic ""Dumb & Dumber"" and Stevenson's ""Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde"". Sometimes the weird gags make you laugh tears, while others are simply too stupid. Jim Carrey is the perfect actor for the role of Charlie/Hank and he really does a great job. He deserved a better script than this one, which is just a dull variation of ""Dumb & Dumber"". ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is definitely no masterpiece but if you like brainless entertainment with bad taste humor, you should take a look at this one. The best thing about this movie is the great soundtrack."
2,It Could Have Been Better!!!!!!!!!!,"""Me, Myself, and Irene"" actually started out funny but, somewhere from the middle towards the end it went downhill. I guess because it went from funny to ridiculous in one fail swoop. Jim Carey can be funny but, I guess he took it too far in this movie because I was highly disappointed."
1,"Defect ridden code examples, Incomplete explanations","Admittedly not the most strightforward subject matter, but this book has too many serious problems. Errors in the code examples, code fragments that don't represent one complete task, etc. OK if you want a high level overview, but a code reference- NO WAY."
2,about the condition,I purchased this book used and the description did not say anything about what is wrong with it. All of the pages are wrinkled as if the entire book was wet at some point. Can I ever sell this book back? Doubt it now. Its warped. thats it I guess. But for $16 its not that bad.
5,A cannot-live-without CD!,"I absolutely adore this CD, and I see the other reviewers agree! It's absolutely gorgeous from start to finish. I, too, listen to it all throughout the year. I love this CD so much that I bought a backup, just in case something ever happens to the original. I also have it in iTunes. There isn't a bad song on this CD. I think everyone should own it! I wish Kenny would do another Christmas CD-soon! He's the best..."
2,This remake of the 1953 classic is disappointing.,"I saw it in 1955 and the current version is a joke by comparison. Part of my reaction is due to my age, I'm sure, but I had the same experience as another reviewer--oversold it to my kids on the basis of my recollection. By any standard though, most of the characters were flat. The director must have blown too much of the budget on special effects."
2,Really Lousy Print,"I expected a perfect print of this film and was BADLY disappointed to find a terrible one instead, full of all sorts of dirt, blips, and other visual noise. For this quality, I would expect to be paying bargain bin prices, not more than [money]!I feel cheated."
5,Where is Col. Fielding when you need him?,"Be sure to notice all the standard Sci-fi actors and even the Beaver's mother ""Kelston's Secretary"" (Barbara Billingsley).This movie was well done with just the right amount of spookiness and has a kid's perspective on what is happening. This is not a kid is smarter than his/her parents movie. There are lots of strange happenings and lots of tension. I will not go into the details as if you have not seen the movie it is more fun to be surprised.Right from the beginning Little David MacLean sees a flying saucer land in the sandpit behind the house. He tells his parents. They being good parents check it out for him and naturally find nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe he had a nightmare or maybe the nightmare is just beginning as everyone starts acting strange and only David can sound the alarm.What would you do? Where is Col. Fielding when you need him?Beginning of the End (Special Edition)"
4,Special effects head of their time.....scary story!,"This is the original...a remake was made in the 80's but it lacks the frightening aspect of this one. It could happen! The scene in the tunnel to the invaders' spaceship is unbelievable...to this day it still amazes me. Having been made in the 50's, it has a certain naivete'. Classic ""sleeper"""
5,Yeh!!,Movie came fast and was in great shape-the movie is a little hokie but thats what makes it fun-if you are an MST3K fan this movie is right up your alley
3,Invaders from Mars,"When I saw this as a kid, the images of the boy seeing flashing lights from his bedroom, discovering a saucer underground nearby, and learning you can't depend on adults to be helpful stuck with me. The production leaves a lot to be desired, especially apparent now when special effects are so much better. Still it was good to see this old chestnut again."
3,Poor Quality,"This is a great movie! I remember watching it as a kid and getting so scared! If you are into old Science Fiction movies, than you will love this! I would recommend that you get the VHS copy, because the DVD version is horrible! This is why I have given it 3 stars. No remastering has been do to it! Still, buy the VHS. It's great!"
2,Can't believe this is a classic,"I watched this while trying to keep in mind the socio-political setting in which it was made - early '50's - Korean War, Red Scare, Congressional hearings on Communist infiltration of the US Government..and the movie does has its moments and the feeling of paranoia is there. But, the last 15 minutes or so as we watch the soldiers and ""Martians"" endlessly run through the web of tunnels around the alien ship is mind-boggingly dull. The set up of the plot is really well down, as has been described here in other reviews, the boy unearths a plot by aliens to take over and control humans, but once we start seeing the seemingly endless montage of military vehicles being brought into place around where the alien ship supposedly is, the film just loses it. From that point, there is no plot. Just because this was one of the first sci-fi films in color doesn't mean it can hold a distinquished place in film history."
3,NEEDS A BETTER DVD TREATMENT,"""This is a very good movie with a cheesy alien suit. The DVD transfer is horrible and this film deserves better! No cheese collection is complete without it!"""
2,Invaders from Mars,"Invaders from Mars is a favorite of mine form when I was a child. Although the movie brought back fond memories, the copy is not in great condition. It appears that the transfer to DVD is fine, but the master has many flaws. I recommend the edition if for nothing else then the movie is fun and a classic example of 1950's science fiction."
1,BAD DISC - BAD AMAZON FOR NO RETURNS,"This was another movie I remember watching and even being a little scared as a youngster. I was delighted to finally find it on Amazon if for no other reason than sentimentality. However, After trying to play the disk in several different players with no success I discovered the reason: the disk itself had a crack all through one side. It is for this reason only I gave it one star and if I could give the packaging any lower rating I would"
1,Catholics Beware,"I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst. Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful."
4,New York style,Billy Joel's Albujms weren't always consisten but they usually always has some stunning material on them. This one is no exception. From the Late Night Jazzy mood peice of the Stranger intro to the popular 'Just the way you are' tothe quite literally brilliant 'Scenes from an Italian restaurant' It reamina a kind of classic in my eyes
1,New Mobile Fidelity SACD Sounds Dreadful! !,I recently purchased this brand new Original Remaster from Mobile Fidelity to replace the decade old Sony/Columbia SACD version that I sold for a large chunk of change and I'm sorry to report that it was a big mistake.The New SACD sounds dull and lifeless like the engineer forgot to add treble to the mix. I'm finding that a lot of mofi's recordings are hit or miss these days. When they hit they're amazing sounding but otherwise they sound flat and compressed and it's a damn shame. $29.00 down the drain. Buyer beware!
3,Should have done a little research,"I understand that as a minister, Jesse Duplantis is inspirational, not necessarily a scholar of any kind. But it seems before writing a book with this title and focus, you could spend about thirty seconds on the Internet and find out what the term ""natural law"" actually means in Christianity. As a moral guideline, natural law has a very long and honorable tradition, especially in Christian faith. This book confuses the issue. Even though Rev. Duplantis explains what HE means by natural law, that's not what natural law actually is.If anyone is actually interested in the topic, I would recommend either ""Fifty Questions on the Natural Law: What It Is and Why We Need It,"" by Charles Rice, or ""Written on the Heart: The Case for Natural Law,"" by J. Budziszewski. Both of the authors are also Christians."
1,Totally WACK,"I totally disagree with the above fore-mentioned review! The pictures did not look ""natural"" at all. Yesss, they looked posed, and dressed up for exactly that fact: posing for pictures in a studio. They have the repetitive same theme ie... atleast 1 or 2 military clad guys, someone sittin' in a chair, someone on a table. It looked like scenes were thrown together without much thought at all. The underwear w/ holes in them; made me think of uncleanliness, also the same ""spreading the cheeks"" pose...sigh...come on! I do agree; however, with the sepia tones...nice indeed. The pictures didn't even fill up a whole page. You could of saved $$$ condensing it into a smaller book. Small pictures do not give the effect of life-like. You wanna feel entrapped or look at every detail in a photograph. I'd have to say the best picture to me is of the uncircumsized falace. This could of just been a cheap magazine for $9.95 in an adult book store."
3,pretty good,Joy Enriquez has a beautiful voice. Some of the songs were kinda boring but there were some really good ones on there.
2,Crushed box,"Received the producy in a crushed box. I ended up finding it less expensive locally on sale. Won't do that again. Price was fine, but shipping kicked it over."
1,i hope they burn in hell,"only truly evil marketing people would dream up a blatant rip off like this. everyone associated with this project is living evidence of the likelihood that there is no god. if there is, their flesh will stoke the fires of hell. otherwise, i hope everyone responsible loses the use of at least one limb."
1,Unsuitable for a woman's wrist,My wrist is not petite and yet this watch was huge and overpowering in size. It should not be advertised as a womans' watch. I'm giving it to my brother .
3,Funny....very funny,"It may be odd to hear, but Joe Pesci, known wiseguy in his roles in Raging Bull, Casino, and Goodfellas can also sing. The first cut is the funniest thing I have ever heard. ""Take your love and shove it up your big fat..."" It is worth buying just to listen to cut after cut of Joe Pesci, singing."
5,BEST DAMN ALBUM EVER MADE!!!,Joe Pesci rocks. He's the best actor and singer in the world. I went to his house! I recoumend this album (especially the dirty version) to everyone who like funny stuuf and liked My Cousin Vinny!
1,The unfunniest comedy record I've ever heard.,"Don't get me wrong. I think Joe Pesci is a brilliant actor and I'm quite a fan, but this CD is criminal for the lack of humor, lack of taste and the over abundance of pedestrian ""Saturday Night Live""-band style arrangements....and oh yes, Joe can't sing that well either. Rent or buy the videos of ""My Cousin Vinny"" or ""Goodfellas"" but don't waste your time and money on this CD -- It doesn't even make a good cocktail coaster -- which is all it's good for."
2,Not my genre,"Well, I'll be honest. The only reason I read this book was because I had been blown away by the authors ""The Book Thief"". This one, on the other hand, simply needed to be blown away!I realise that perhaps I am being unfair, as this book was after all, geared to teenagers. Nevertheless, had expected to see the genius the author displayed in the other book.Would like to have read something else totally."
5,Very Helpful at 3 AM,"This book was recommended to me by my OB/GYN, and I found it to be very helpful when I would freak out in the middle of the night... I particularly appreciated the fact that all the scary-but-rare stuff was put in one chapter at the end, so you could look it up if you needed to, but you didn't have to encounter it when you were looking for more routine information. Too many other pregnancy books have the scary-but-rare information throughout, so you spend time worrying needlessly."
3,Skilled at minute description,"Checkhov is skilled at the minute description. When he describes the plight of a trapped bug, that description stays with you. And even more important, he describes relationships - the man and estranged wife, the ready-to-retire doctor and his long suffering wife...With Checkhov's background as a medical doctor, his observations and detailed analyses make a lot of sense. I enjoy his short stories (though some are pretty darned long!) Some of his descriptions will stay with you a very long time."
3,What is CN thinking ?,"Instead of messing about, like some late-night TV ads hawking one-hit wonders, CN should release DVDs of the individual shows- especially COURAGE THE COWARDLY DOG. Let the fans have what they want."
3,Worth It,"After seeing a movie about these ladies, and learning it was true, I immediately checked for relevant books. It's been a little while since my last great true-crime find. This book is meaty and well-researched. It's got extensive quotes in the sisters' native French, with English translations (most of the time.) This is *not* a light or a quick read, which is why it's been living on my coffee table so I can go back to it in little sessions. I read far more fiction that non-fiction, and even for non-fiction this one's a bit dense! It's the only book on this subject that I could find online, and worth reading. So, struggle on!"
2,"tiny fingers, big noses","Yes, these are lovely glasses...BUT. The big bowl certainly develops the wine's nose, but my own nose presses against the rim (only 2.25 inches in diamter) when I sip, so much of the pleasure is lost. And the stem provides only about an inch of clearance between bowl and foot which makes for very awkward handling. Seemed like a bargain, but mine are about to be returned to Amazon."
4,Cool,This is another great classic Atari has to offer. The game play can be confusing though. I have passed this game but only about 3 times!
1,Don't purchase this version,"This book contains numerous typographical errors that make it difficult to read. A statement from the publisher in the front of the book claims that because the book was scanned by a ""robot"" it contains textual errors (and no images) but that the buyer can access the correct version on-line. Amazon.com should acknowledge these errors in the book in advertising it. In any case, it strikes me that the publisher of this book has scanned it and put it up for sale simply to profit from the opportunity (since this book is now out of copyright), and for no other reason."
1,disappointed,"The product I received was not what I ordered. It was a different type of Pantene. I returned the package the same day, (at my expense) because it was not what I ordered. I was a 25.4 oz bottle, but not the Pro V, Daily Moisture Renewal Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry or Damaged hair. I was very disappointed that it was not the right kind because I had searched quite a while for it."
2,Too old.,"Much of the information contained in this book is misleading because it is outdated. Not a good preparation tool for standardized exams, as many of the practices recommended in this book count as mistakes on those exams. Certain things, like using semicolons to separated a list of items that contain commas, are pretty good ideas, but are not part of standard English anymore."
3,Needs revision.,"Part of the xx Made Simple series, this volume (c. 1981) needs to be updated and revised."
2,making the best of the set,"hi, my name is peter i just bought the sd5k drum set and i was tottaly dissapointed. It sounds like a toy, but i was lucky that i still had my old roland sound module and my old kick drum, now it sounds great, the pads on the new set are pretty good, so if i were you i would spend a little more money and get a better set if i didnt have the capability of putting different drum parts on i would send it back in a heart beat."
2,"Not ""Simmons"" of old","The pads are velocity sensitive and the cymbals only single zone, compared with Roland etc who have dual zone (this means you can get a ride and crash on the cymbal depending on how you hit it).While you get quite a lot for your money here, the quality is not up to that of the basic Roland, Yamaha, Millenium,... kits and the sensitivity of the brain is not comparable IMO - and compared to the ddrum brains they are blown out of the sky.Also, these drums are apparently not real ""Simmons"". I am told that there has been no permission granted to Medeli for use of the name 'Simmons', and ""their unauthorised use of the name is currently the subject of legal action by the original inventor""."
1,My Pyrex exploded too!,"My Pyrex 8x8 inch square cake pan shattered just ten minutes after putting the (room-temperature) dish into a hot oven. It broke into large and small pieces, and hundreds of little glass shards as well. No more pyrex for us!"
1,exploding pyrex!,yup this did happen to me tonight! i've had this dish for months and ive even put it under the broiler! but today i guess it was really cold out. i read online that the dish can explode from thermal shock! i emailed pyrex to let them know. but i doubt they will do anything. i think the new pyrex dishes are made differently than the vintage ones! i love the old ones!
5,Healthy Exercise,"Having previous experience with this product, when I returned to an exercise program, this was one of the first pieces of equipment I acquired. Still a great product."
3,Historical richness presides in Fitzgerald novels,"This is the third novel I've read of this writerand what strikes me is the compelling sense ofplace and time even though I have never beenthere.A parallel would be if you were at a play andthe moment the lights came up and the actorsbegan speaking you were somewhere else in yourmind's eye.What Penelope Fitzgerald does not give us, Ithink, is a plot that has any definitive resolution. Instead it is in my opiniona time travel surrealness existence where one'smind explores different places and times readingextraordinary writing."
3,Getting warmer.....,"Deana Carter has a half step on the crop of country music cuties -- male and female -- who have knocked Haggard, Cash, Wynette et al. into oblivion. Unlike others in the genre (insipids like Neal McCoy, Shania Twain, Bryan White, David Kersh and Mindy McReady come to mind), Carter has a unique voice and genuine musical chops.And, she seems willing to challenge the Nashville forumula. You could sense that with the title of her last CD (""Did I Shave My Legs...""), even if much of the material was bland.The CD starts off promisingly, with the rocking ""You Still Shake Me,"" and the finales (""Train Song"" and the title track) are effective. But, in between, the material is a touch on the bland side. Exceptions: the Melanie chestnut, ""Brand New Key"" and Carter's own ""Dickson County.""No matter how disappointing, you can hear that she's trying to break out of the Nash-Vegas mold. And, I bet her next CD will be golden....."
4,The classic successful album 4.5 stars,"The songs on here are great, the album that kept them on the map. my only problem was that it's great for the bonus tracks on remasters , but how many versions of ""All Right Now"" had to be included on this?"
3,Parallel Lives,"I thought it was a good book with humorous plays, but I it was not what i was looking for. I was looking for a appropriate play book for highschool ""Dramatic Duo's"". For Speech, an after school ativity. This book was filled with too much adult humor for my use. I would not recommend it for teenagers nor children, but however I would for an adult skit or play."
2,REDUNDANT INFORMATION,"why is a book on avid xpress dv telling me how to log in to Windows XP, or how to resize windows by clicking on the corners of dialog boxes? there is so much unnecessary information in the book that it makes it difficult to read and follow through, often finding myself skipping several pages. there is so much filler and double-spacing that makes up 80% of the bulk in this book.for example on page 1-15, the author explains moving a bin into a folder. ""to move a bin into a folder, click and drag the bin icon to the folder triangle. When you release the mouse, the bin appears in the folder."" that is just painful! get to the point! explain the program not the mechanics of the operating system!who doesn't know how to drop down the list of trash contents by clicking on the side-arrow? one can intuitively make these decisions as the interface of xpress dv is not cryptic at all!a terrible read! just use the online Help files instead."
2,"Potential, but not this version","A book on injury prevention is definitely needed in the yoga community. Unfortunately, this book falls short. I think it has potential and a second edition would be great. However, the first 46 pages should be condensed in to about 5-10, fluff in general should be limited, and the diagrams in the asana section should be more informative.Repetitively on each page in the asana section the author refers to muscle groups and provides a beautifully drawn diagram with too few good, useful labels. This style left me frustrated and confused. In general, it is a gorgeous book, but absolutely tedious at times."
1,Save Your Money,"I am very disappointed in the book The book is written poorly, very dry and expensive for what you get. It really isn't a good reference guide there is no glossary or chapter listing. The best information I have on Anatomy is the DVD by Paul Grilley Anatomy for Yoga."
2,Won Ton Mess,"I have put off purchasing Won Ton Baby for a while, because although it is a supposed horror-comedy that got good reviews and stars Debbie Rochon (one of my favorite actresses), the movie just looked too silly to me. And after watching it, I can attest that it really is too silly. The baby looks absolutely ridiculous, and the kills are few and far between. The comedy is also few and far between. What there is is far too much drama. The scenes with Debbie and the cop are just boring, and belong in a chick flick instead of a movie like this. There is also a scene in the movie where a baby is pleasuring itself while watching a fetish video, that was just unnecessary and revolting. Really, the only stuff in this movie that was good is Debbie Rochon's performance (too good for this movie), and the gore which is good whenever it appears. Avoid, unless you're a fan of Rochon like me."
5,New into hi-fi Audio,"this headphone is absolutely amazing, everything sounds so much more ""alive."" i buckled down and bought these headphones instead of the dt. 990's since i prefer more isolation. it does allow for some sound to come through but at the volume i listen to it's very much minimal.Note. if you plan on listening from an iphone or ipod, though you will be able to hear the music at an appropriate volume, the jack on the iphone left me wanting more clarity and volume, but when i plugged my computer and iphone into my home stereo receiver, i could see just what these cans have to offer. so i strongly recommend getting a portable amp nothing too much maybe the fiio-E6 or E11...these things kick but though and i would definitely recommend these to anyone who is interested in a better music experience.i personally don't feel that these are ""boomy"" or ""Muddy"". they aren't ""flat"" though they have a little bit of a u signature,play on music lovers!"
1,Not an introduction,"The online description states ""Ideal for introductory university modules"", but the preface of the book (which is not included in the pages that are provided for online viewing) states ""This book is not a basic signal processing textbook... it is assumed you have a good knowledge of sampling, difference equations, z-transforms, FIR and IIR filters, FFT, etc."" I was looking for something more basic so I sent it back."
2,Different...,"First, let me say, that I absolutely ADORE ""Bird by Bird"" and ""Traveling Mercies."" Anne Lamott is unlike any writer I've ever read. She is honest, sincere and tremendously funny.Second, I must admit that I am not fully eligible to write a review for this book; I have not yet read it. But, what I must say is that I did read the first chapter, and on that I will base my review.The first paragraph of the book begins by bashing George W. Bush. I have figured out that Lamott is a liberal from her other books, and I still love and respect them, but this book starts off on a whole different note from her others.I respect Anne Lamott, and in time, I will read the entire book, and I will write another review if my opinions have changed. But for now, I will wait until it comes out in soft cover. (A bit less expensive, as I feel that purchasing the hardcover is a little too much: I don't agree with a word she said in the first chapter.)Happy reading if you choose to do so!"
4,love lamott,"Anne Lamott finds God in the ordinariness of her day. She writes with intimacy and honesty about the challenges of just being alive, of being mother, daughter, friend, and committed liberal in these conservative times. In ""Plan B"" she shares her continuing faith journey in mid-life, struggling to enjoy her success and her family, and coming to terms with the loss that greets everyone who has lived long enough to watch a parent die. She can be laugh-out-loud funny: she names her saddle-bag thighs ""the aunties"" and vows to treat them with love and respect. I looked forward to every chapter and, when I put the book down,I felt as if I'd had been with a very funny and deeply insightful friend."
3,Entertaining read,"I so enjoyed Traveling Mercies and Bird By Bird that I couldn't wait to read Plan B. Ann Lamott's descriptiveness, honesty and depth becon. I appreciated her efforts but couldn't get away from the feeling I was just reading a series of magazine articles that were connected by a thin thread."
1,Plan B,"(...)It will take the multiple panicked pumps of CPR to provide minimal resuscitation for a collection of jumbled stream of consciousness ramblings about streetwise spirituality a la Oprah Winfrey, M. Scott Peck and Dalai Lama/Deepak Chopra.Robin Williams has the cure for this sort of illiterature: a few light slams."
5,A Veritable Message Carried by an Unlikely Messenger,"I have almost nothing in common with the Anne Lamott.George Bush, to me, does not represent the end of civilization as we know it. My three children, my wife and I survived their adolescence. Time passes. With help, I survive, occasionally, even thrive.Yet, I drew comfort from her book. Reading her well-written, brutally honest narrations of life's daily struggles, I gathered spiritual hope.Not everyone comes to faith by the high road. The gift of grace is available for each of us regardless of our backgrounds. Anne Lamott's communicates the essence of Christian faith. It is not found in dogma, but rather, grace. By opening our hearts in the midst of confusion and hopelessness, the world becomes a safer and more loving place."
2,Skip it.,"Anne Lamott is at her best when she's writing about her faith and her kid; she's at her worst when she ventures into the realm of political commentary. Unfortunately, this book had too much of the latter and not enough of the former. There are some gems here, but not enough to make me recommend it."
2,Try Fluid Power Yoga Instead,"As a yoga video junkie, I have tried out a lot of different routines and instructors...and the best I've come across so far is Yoga for Surfers Fluid Power Yoga -- you don't even have to be a surfer to benefit from it! It's really beautiful, and Peggy Hall strikes just the right balance between the physical and spiritual sides of yoga. There are easy modifications to follow, and she's really inspiring and encouraging. She also ends with a very peceful relaxation sequence -- great images for visualizaion without getting sappy. There's a real sense of beginning, middle, and end, a full, complete practice. I also have Yoga for Surfers I, and I'll buy whatever else Peggy Hall creates!"
4,WW 2 Pacific War Revisited,"If you've read the responsible histories of the Pacific War, Michener's 1946 book offers and all together different take of that event--a home-front view, as it were, more civilian, and provincial, in character than military. It brings back a time when the islands of the South Pacific were once merely vague dot in the ocean with strange names and even stranger people. And it's not often that World War 2 is turned into musical comedy."
4,Has Stood the Test of Time,"I have read and enjoyed a number of Michener novels. I decided to read this one after visiting Pearl Harbor and watching the HBO series ""The Pacific."" I was interested in reading about Michener's experiences in the Pacific Theatre of WWII, and I was also interested to read his first book (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize).There is no need to give a full review of a book that has been in circulation for so long. I enjoyed this one. It has stood the test of time. And it is an easy read. I did find it a bit slow about half or two-thirds of the way through. If you are a Michener fan or are interested n the Pacific Theatre of WWII, I recommend this book."
3,Goofing off at war,"This is a pretty good book, but I kept getting the feeling Michener didn't really do much in World War II. He's got a lot to say about officers messing around with women, and that's okay. He's got a lot to say about getting ready to fight, and that's okay. But fighting? Not much. Oh well, at least he didn't write about a lot of blood baths. Still, it hardly seems like a war novel."
5,A Taste of Heaven in Your Mouth!,"I once sampled some of these candies at a wedding party. They are, without a doubt, a delicious taste treat! If you can find them, buy a bag and put them out at your next special event. Then watch as they disappear as fast as the first person tries them and speads the word. They will be gone in a blink - that is how good these candies are. They are expensive, so you'll only want to use them for special occassions. If you have any left over, make sure you find a really good hiding place for them!kone"
4,80's Overload,"Good Lord, this is 80's to the max, but on a global scale. This collection has not only many of the american top hits, but also includes the international hits as well. My fave's include tose funky cheeky hits like "" Can't Take My Eyes Off You"", ""One Night in Bangkok"" and ""Boogie Oogie Oogie"". There's even a few live tracks to spruce things up, like Alan Parson's ""Eye In The Sky"" and David Bowie's ""China Girl"". Personally, I'm not that familiar with many of the europen hits, but if you are in need of an international 80's fix, you can't get a better collection than this."
3,Shadddap you face,"Researching this title has uncovered he song that goes ""Whatsa Matta You, Gotta no respect?"" By a guy named Joe Dolce.Popular in the early '80s I haven't heard this crazy song in more than twenty years."
3,Jelena Karleusa's version of 'Gia' is 100% better.,"I would totally agree with one of the previous reviews stating that Jelena Karleusa does a much better interpretation of the song 'Gia'. Jelena is certainly not one of the very best performers, but she makes this song come alive and you get this urge to boogie on. Despinas Greek part in the song was good, but when it came to english words, it was stupidly horrific.Anywho.. soon we will be hearing of Jelena some much more as she sets to release her debut single very soon. www.karleusa.comStill LOVE YA Despina"
5,in a class of its own...[possible spoilers],"...and I don't mean just that it's an excellent book; it is, but unlike Sachs' other books (Amy, Laura, Veronica Ganz), this is the most un-childlike children's book I've ever read -- indeed, I read it as an adult and it resonates with me to this day. Unbearably sad, and I don't even recall the end as being hopeful (if I recall, it ends with the possibility of the kids being split up between foster families). But I would even go so far as to say it's a must-read for kids. If this were Sachs' only book, she'd have a right to be proud."
1,A Compliation of lies,"Your driving a 68ft truck with 30 tons of cargo through a hostile fire zone. Youve been driving for hours and hours cause you cant shoot your weapon, heck you barely lift it. Theres oncoming traffic but your so tired you can barely control the truck. You swerve into trafic and your mirror explodes what do you do. If your SFC Chamber you make up a lie and you just keep driving. Like the time you drove through the army ten miler cause you wouldnt listen to anyone, or all the times you damaged vehicles, cause like shooting you couldnt drive either. Isnt that right drill seargent, oh werent you stripped of that to cause you LIE!"
3,Great Music - Terrible sound!,"I realize that for $5 this is a steal - but I happen to own some of these songs on regular CD and, yes, LP and Cassette, and I have to warn all Fela fans: don't waste your money! The way all these great songs here were digitized is a shame, they sound flat and thin and lame which is NOT what Fela should sound like!! If you never heard of him, go ahead, you won't know what you're missing...."
4,Data tables,"data is presented at the level of the 452 districts. population, density,sex ratio, literacy by sex.percentage population change for each decade since 1901.no maps"
4,Fun,An early work by Dave (when his first child was born) with lots of cute illustrations and his typical sarcastic good-natured humor. Nothing here was memorably hilarious but enough cute snippets fill it to make reading it worthwhile.
3,OK but brief,"It was more like a pamphlet, very brief but self explanatory and very pratical with personal examples. Recommend it for every christian."
5,Among Schoolchildren is a terrific book.,"I am a college student majoring in education and I read ""Among Schoolchildren"" for my class. I really enjoyed this book. It was easy for me to get caught up in the class she was teaching. I wanted to know what was going to happen to Clarence and felt bad when he had to leave the class. I wonder if I would have done the same thing? This book made me realize all of the challenges I will face in teaching and also made me anxious to start teaching."
5,Great Book,I had to read this book for an education class.I was not sure what to expect but was pleasantly suprised.The book gave great insight into what teaching in a diversy society is all about. It made you understand what kids today were up against. The book is written in the form of a novel and makes for great reading.
5,To the Heart and Soul of Teaching,"I was still new to teaching when I read this book in 1990. It had a profound effect on me. Although the subject of Kidder's book was an elementary teacher in Massachusetts, it was all so familiar to a high school teacher in California. Tracy Kidder captured the essence of teaching in an area where kids are deprived and in many cases, unloved and uncared for. It is a task so daunting, so wrenching that you wonder how you survived it. You are being paid to teach, but what Kidder describes is what teacher's actually do: teach, mentor, support, provide for, encourage, inspire, and struggle with the realities of their students' world. Kidder is masterful in describing the intricacies of this world. He is all seeing, but absent as his subjects speak for themselves. And he sees into the heart of being a teacher-that in addition to teaching, teacher's save lives."
3,A bit enlightening,"This is my first Tracy Kidder book. I liked the book, but I cannot say it was gripping. I am not a teacher, but I do have elementary age children in a Christian school, have many friends that are teachers and care alot about the level of education our children are receiving. The teacher, did have a heart for all of her students, the troubled and troubling ones as well as the more adjusted ones. They were all from less than stable households, so the magnitude of the job in front of her can truly only be appreciated by those that have ""walked in her shoes"" so to say. This book left a lot to be desired, but I did appreciate the insight into the level of dedication one would truly have to have to enter into a classroom such as this. Perhaps school teachers would appreciate this book much more. I am going to pass mine on to my friend who teaches in the inner city of Chicago to students who possess many of the same issues."
3,short but enjoyable,"The plot is a little predictable but that is coming from our modern day view. This book was written 35 years ago and from that perspective, it is more interesting. Science fiction seen from the backward perspective often is. It is short, but that is good given the quality--I don't know if I'd enjoy it if it went on for 400 pages. Silverberg's view of how our world will end up if we continue to overpopulate is intriguing and a little frightening."
1,A Waste Of Time,That's what watching this movie was for me. I could have rented anything but I must have been temporarily insane and picked this thing up off the shelf.
3,Not bad,"This film is low-budget. The acting is not good, but the story is quite good - if you can stomach the incestuous over-tones; the father returns after a long abscence to put the bite on one daughter, than another (who has a lesbian lover), as well he 'infects' his wife, son, and then puts the bite on his pregnant daugter-in-law (the 'bite' is more implied - we see the results).It can be off-putting because of this and a few other disturbing sequences, but the scene of two daughters, the lesbian lover, the mother all sharing blood is quite interesting - a family feast."
1,They're too darn big,"They are huge, and this is not indicated in the product description. Buy them if you want gigantic wine glasses. I am returning mine!"
5,Very Different! There's Not Another Book Like This!,"As a parent and Sunday school teacher, I am constantly on the lookout for new material to help students. When I discovered this book, the title drew me in immediately; but the content was incredible. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I ordered enough for my entire Sunday school class. So far, every student that has finished the book has given the most incredible feedback I have heard from any book over the past few years. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Could have been made today,"Saw this movie when it first came out. I did not realize that Ratso was Dustin Hoffman, he was transformed completly into his character. Two drifters, losers, bums, find they have a lot in common and become friends, first by necessity then a real friendship was born. Truly great cinema and great acting. Enjoy!"
5,acting tour de force!,"MIDNIGHT COWBOY will always be a classic due to the superb acting by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Top notch performances also by Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, Barnard Hughes and splendid direction by John Schlesinger and a legendary song 'Everybodys Talkin' by Harry Nilsson. Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. This film released in 1969 brings two 'losers' together in the big city and their unlikely relationship culminates in one of the most impressionable final film scenes of all-time. A little dated as far as the outrageous party scenes but still a powerful, emotional film."
2,I Don't Get It,"I didn't get this at all!! The flashbacks were totally confusing Dustin Hoffman talking like a cartoon character while limping through the city was irritating and Jon Voight was boring. I know this is supposed to be one the best movies ever made, but I didn't like it at all."
5,TIMELESS AND DATED AT THE SAME TIME!,"Few films with this type of style age this well. Midnight Cowboy despite having a very dated construction, it still one of the most interesting and sad films ever made. Hoffman and Voight carry the entire film on their shoulders and make a very unpleasant story tolerable.It had been many years since I had seen this and I will admit, I liked it better now than when I first saw it in the 70's, but some confusing flashback sequences and dated situations keep this film from being perfect. The two stars chemistry and the films undeniable raw and uncompromising story are something that stay with the viewer long after the credits role.I saw this on an HD channel and it looked crisp and clean, I do own the 2 disc edition which is excellent with a nice transfer and quality extra material."
1,not the old pyrex,"i put in borosilicate glass in my search options and pyrex glass came up. It is NOT borosilicate glass, but rather soda glass and has become a safety issue because of its propensity to break and shatter. Be very wary of pyrex and anchor-hocking products because they are not the safety glass of yore. I was specifically looking for European made dishes of borosilicate glass to replace my pyrex ones."
2,Stinky!!!,"So this stuff is wonderful because it's all natural and actually works, right? Well, unfortunately, the price is that NOBODY will go near you when this is on you - even you will want to keep away from yourself! This stuff STINKS!!!"
3,the history of us teacher manual,"I feel that the teacher manual isn't neccesary. I can come up with a series of review questions and comprehension questions on my own. Of course, some people may benefit from this if they have difficulty making up their own, but if yourself read the chapter I think you can do this."
3,Rich Classical Melodies(Light on Tribal Rhythms),"This releases' liner notes promise ""rich classical melodies with African tribal rhythms and traditional Oriental and Middle Eastern tones to create a sound that is unique, otherworldly, and elegant"". World Beat and ethnic lovers take note, you might be let down. While it certainly has some nice music, ""otherworldly"" is kind of stretching it a bit! That is why I'm only giving it three stars (the shame probably is more on Higher Octave for the stretch!). The highlights for me were Paul Schmidt's beautiful classical guitar arpeggios and triplets on ""LA CATHEDRAL"" and ""PRELUDE"". The light vocals by Jennifer Scott and Christine Duncan are well done, and the overall production is slick. The CD has some nice moments, and WILL satisfy those who like Yanni and that type of classically tinged New Age."
2,To Technical,"This was just to technical for me. I prefer Delerium, Conjure One, and Enigma, much better variety."
1,About as good as cold French fries...,"The most over-rated artist in the Groove/Atmospheric (read Enigma-like) genre has to be Mythos. In fact, this CD doesn't belong in this category at all. A stark, miserable even depressing recording. It is lifeless, cold and dark. Delerium (as an example of excellent music) might be considered by many to be ""dark"", but it isn't cold, lifeless AND dark!I have listened to this CD many times to try to like it, and alas, it is consistantly uninspiring at best. My collection of ""this type"" of music numbers some 80 CDs by 50+ artists and this is clearly the worst. A previous reviewer put into words the essence of my feelings, ""...listened to the album ten times and still unable to recall a single composition a couple of days later. Used chewing gum, completely flavorless and rigid.""Here are just a few titles to buy before you waste your money on this: Phobos, Pilgrimage, Aria and Aria II, State of Grace, Liberia, Spirit Level, Libera, Delerium."
4,don't be sold short...,"boots are extremely well made. toe is a bit pointier than expected but MOST importantly, the sizing is a full size smaller than ""normal"" i ordered 40 which has always been my euro size (10 u.s.) & amazon's apparel chart confirms, but pair i rec'd said 40 on box and u.s. size 9. painful."
4,gritty and fun,"read these 3 novellas on plane from New Zealand to Jakarta. Not much business to be had in Indonesia but the book made the trip worthwhile. A new writer for me and I was impressed with the ironic, slightly weary style and with the gentle humour - not taking itself too seriously. Highly recommended."
3,It's okay for basic stuff,"I use this just as a checkbook because I don't do much else. It is annoying when you set up recurrent payments, but it duplicates them by 'estimating' future payments. It messed me up for a minute."
3,Quicken Basic 2008,"I hate this WIN program; my old MAC program is far easy to use. As a matter of fact, I never used Quicken Basic 2008 WIN due to such inconveniences. I failed to import my QIF files from my old MAC Quicken 4, though I contacted Intuit Tech Help several times and their instructions never worked."
1,discontinues after 3 years,"Don't buy Quicken. I was shocked to get an email from them saying that my Quicken 2004 software would no longer work for downloading data after April 30, 2007.The software automatically disables online downloads after three years. This is now company policy.I have used Quicken for many years but now I am going with GnuCash-- it is free, open-source, and works great!"
3,it works with Windows XP Home edition,I see a lot of negative reviews but the product worked for me. My Toshiba laptop came with an older version of Quicken so I upgraded to this version without significant issues.I will agree that each new version is somewhat worse than the previous versions but I am able to download my bank and brokerage accounts into Quicken and it does keep the data there for me.I don't care for the new reports section as no matter how I save a report for one security when I bring it up later all subsequent securities have been added to it. That is frustrating but not a deal breaker.I'm not a Quicken cheerleader but this is a passable piece of software.You have to buy the update to print out some tax documents.Also can't download from Paypal or Emigrantdirect.com
5,"A beautiful, touching account of marriage.","M. L'engle writes so candidly about her feelings and her experiences that at first you feel like an eavesdropper. That doesn't last long. I soon found myself feeling extremely grateful for her willingness to share what was probably the toughest time in her life. This book illustrates what love is all about. And also how marriage, above all things, is a beautiful, spiritual, sacrifice of self."
3,disapointed,"I love the Pink Dots! I have seen them in concert so many times I have lost count. My brother has almost everything ever recorded by this incredible group. I listened to this album several times in my car and I was very disapointed with the sound Quality. The mix was bad. The piano would start off so quiet you had to turn the sound full on. Then the vocals would come in and it will blow your ears off. The whole album doesn't sound right. On some songs the music is louder than the vocals and others the opposite. Now my car has a great sounding stereo and I listen to most of my music in my car, but I tried it on my home stereo and I was shocked at the difference. In surround mode it sounded so much better. A lot of the sounds missing in ""stereo"" are heard in the surround speakers and they sound great. So if you want to listen to this cd, try it in surround and it is well worth while."
5,Midnight,"Their now is a new prophecy including one cat from each Clan to go on a long journey to save the clans from destruction. Brambleclaw of Thunder Clan, Feathertail of RiverClan, Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, and Crowpaw of WindClan go to the sun-drown place (the sea) to find out what to do to save their Clans. Not only the four chosen cats go though. Two other cats come along; Squirrelpaw and Stormfur go with them. Meanwhile back at the forest the Clans are wondering where they went because they didn't know they went on a journey. On the journey they meat a loner called Purdy who helps them through Twoleg place. When they get there they meet Midnight. They find out from Midnight that a great evil is coming from the forest.This book is as good as the first of the original prophecy, but is more adventurous. This book will make you want to read onward and find out how they escape the danger that haunts the forest. If you thought it was over at the end of the sixth book you need to think again."
5,Suprised,"I found this book at Borders when I was browsing the shelves. It caught my eye, so I bought it. The first page was amazing! This book holds the readers' attention. I was actually sad when the book ended, wishing it'd go on. Fortunatley for me, there was a sequel. The sequel, ""Moonlight"", is good too, as is the rest of the series down to the last word."
1,I did not find it humurous or interesting.,If you like the TV show Hee Haw you will probably like this simple book
3,Better than playing video games,"Only You Can Save Mankind is a solid Pratchett book, aimed at the young adult set. While a tiny bit dated (it's set during the First Gulf War, as noted in the preface), it ages pretty well. There were several laugh out loud moments - which is a rarity for any book, particularly one that's not explicitly set out to be comedy. Even for those young-at-heart, it's a great way to spend a lazy morning (or evening) instead of, well, playing video games."
4,review of only you can save mankind,well what can I say it's a Terry Pratchett book and I have always enjoyed his books. This book certainly holds your interest
4,A worthy sequel,This sequel was well worth the wait. Although I found the later chapters to move slow at times this is Berger at his best. The chapters dealing with Tombstone are as charming and witty as the material in the original story. An enjoyable read!
4,Compton Calling,"This cat is definitely the clarion of the Compton scene. He's gotten precious little attention, but hne tells it like it is."
5,Alaska is Outstanding,"I watched this movie expecting a solid, 3- or 4-star action/adventure movie. Instead, my husband and I found ourselves caught up in an outstanding drama-- oh, and it had plenty of action and adventure, too. This is the BEST movie of this type we've seen in a very long time, and the first one we've ever given 5 stars to. Note: Be patient, it takes a while for this movie to fully develop, but when it does, WOW!"
3,Lightweight Adventure film.,"When a Pilot (Dirk Benedict) Crash landed in the mountains of British Columbia, there`s no way, he could contact someone to help him or getting out of the mountain. When the father kids (Vincent Kartheiser & Thora Birch) are sure, they could help thier father, while they are followed by a Orphaned Cup. When an Animal Hunter (Oscar-Winner:Charlton Heston) is seaching for the Cub and Wanting the Kill the Animal.Directed by Fraser Clarke Heston (Needful Things) has made an entertaining (At times unbelivable) adventure for the whole family, This film has gorgeous Panoramic shots of Glaciers and Forests are all in a Plus. This is a very underrated film. The young and old will have a good time with this. DVD is also in Widescreen and it has Pan & Scan format. Super 35. Grade:B."
5,The single best collection of horror tales available,"I don't have much to add to the excellent reviews already detailing the merits of this book, so I'll just say that as far as I'm concerned it is simply the best collection horror stories you can get. So many of my all time favorites stories I read here for the first time: ""The Willows"" ""Seaton's Aunt"" ""Sticks"" ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" ""The Call of Cthulu"" ""The Reach"". The book covers a wide range of styles and eras, so not every story will appeal to every reader. But if you want to see the best that horror has to offer, you can't do better than this collection."
4,Basic there are better options for less money,"This book is intended for people with basic/recent debt (such as a late utility bill, a late credit card bill, falling behind due to recent unemployment issues), and it deals with basic credit issues. It's really not useful for someone with old debts (more than a year or so), &/or multiple credit issue.Here are 2 books I bought that give the same information but at a cheaper priceCredit Repair Tips - How To Improve Your Credit Score Fast!Credit Repair - Fix Your Credit Starting Today (The Fast Track To A Clean Credit Report And Improved Credit Scores)"
3,Informative and potentially useful,"This book is informative and should provide at least the ""basics"" of dealing with credit report problems. I felt more comfortable getting information out of this book than from doing Internet searches."
5,Great Deal on rechargable batteries,"I use these for battery powered scrub brush as well as garden battery power tools, and these are longer lasting than the regular ones that usually come with the products that you get."
5,Great antenna. Works like a charm.,This antenna works very well. We have had it for almost a year. We love it.
3,Needs some work,"CONS:The internal strainer isn't fine enough. If you take it out, the lid is loose.Watch out for leaks when pouring.The handle gets really hot. I mean, really hot.PROS:It looks cool in my office."
5,Superb!,"This is the best recording of the 7th symphony around and the 1st symphony has to be one of the only ""burning through the bone"". What I know of the mighty Helsinki Philharmonic is that they are Sibelius-orchestra #1 with vigorous tradition towards their ""house-composer"", Jean Sibelius. Having heard this orchestra live two times with maestro Segerstam conducting I have to say it is #1 Sibelius-orchestra in the world. Inspiration and vision in Segerstam flows easily and he clearly understands the metalevels on these accounts. The best buy in the market right now."
4,In Search of Chaco,"This book has been put together and edited by one person. It is written by a number of authors. Each author writes about a different topic. There are also different views about the same topic. Book goes through some of the changes of the canyon and its peoples. Also, the purpose of this particular site. Very Interesting."
1,nobody said anything about horrible singing!,"Bummer,I just downloaded this because I really love Mick harris and several of his already mentioned incarnations.But reading these reviews,I think at least someone would have mentioned that some horrible dweeb was going to ""drivel"" all over my ambience,I was hoping for more ""Lull"", instead I got Dull!Oh,and for only $21.00.I Hate!"
3,"wonderful details, but something seems to be missing","This book has apparently stood the test of time. While I read it, I had no idea that it had been written 30 years ago. The historic details are magnificent, as is Delderfield's sense of English geography. The story is rather simple and predictable however. And the characters are too perfect. No character is this book is ever in danger of knowing failure, and to me, that detracts from their depth."
3,too wordy,"It's a very good story. Very informative, however, the author gets too carried away with description. The story could be told very nicely with about 20% less descriptive words. It's like the author is trying to write several books within a book. I have read several Ken Follett books, which are long stories but really keeps the reader into it."
4,Indian perspective,"This book is definitely not a unbiased study of Indo-Pak relationship. However, this book is a rather important for understanding the India-Pakistan conflict as it gives a complete detail of the Indian government's view of Pakistani establishment.Mr. J.N. Dixit is probably the most influential bureaucrat in the Ministry of Foreign affairs in India and his account explains why India views Pakistan with deep suspicion. Whether his views are correct or not is irrelevant. The bottom line is that he is probably still playing a critical part in India's Pakistan policy and hence one cannot escape it.A well written book by a policy veteran. Definitely a great resource and a must read."
1,Really Poor Quality,These really aren't worth the money. They don't lay flat and aren't uniform thickness. Many are cracked or have knot holes. The ones that are whole usually aren't cut straight. I just grabbed a random handful. Twelve of fifteen are unusable. I wish I hadn't let my 6yo take some out before I looked at them. Otherwise I would return them.
3,"Great Features, Poor Lifespan","I bought this watch 2 years ago. I really like the features and the band which does not break. I have about 4 other Casio watch's, w/o the band that are still working. This watch has a band that will flex but not break.The downside to this watch is that after 2 years the back light has stopped working and the alarms do not sound. The battery is fine. A quick check of my options shows that repairing the solar style watches cost almost as much as a new watch. My advice is find a Casio model you like that doesn't have the solar battery charge feature, stick with a standard battery. The solar is a gimmick in my opinion."
3,Video Quality does not justify Cost,"Video Quality does not justify Cost in my opinion at the Amazon discounted retail price of 29.95.Yes this is a great show - but I wonder how much effort or cost went into actually acquiring the best available prints - compared to so many other TV box sets, this is for me questionable.About half of the Episodes are very poor quality - looks like a bad bootleg.I still enjoy the series but for the price they might have done a restoration. I can see for this type of quality paying a third of the price, like those low budget poor quality DVD box sets put out by small studios, and often public domain DVD's.Next time I will buy a cheap used copy or just rent.Shout Factory lately are releasing lesser quality from what I have seen here and some other box sets. I do believe the price should reflect the quality."
2,"Video quality poor, but glad to have anyway.","I agree with other reviews. The video quality is surprisingly poor in this day and age of remastering. I can't believe that SHOUT Factory didn't take the time to clean up the source tapes more before releasing this set. While I am glad to have the Room 222 series being released on DVD, I hope they will give us better quality prints on future season releases. Comparitively, Shout Factory's That Girl is spectacular and that show was shot on film as well as Room 222. I hope that if SHOUT Factory remasters this first season they will offer a swap out to those of us who already purchased the poor quality copies."
1,Horrible picture quality!,Room 222: Season OneDon't waste your money on this DVD collection. Upon immediate viewing you will notice that the distributor spent absolutely no money on remastering from the original television series. The picture quality is beyond poor. I was expecting quality equivalent to the Mod Squad series releases. I wouldn't even spend the money on a VHS version of this.
1,Never have I spent so much time learning so little,"I am now at day 16 of the 21 days. Over the past 30 years I have taught myself COBOL, FORTRAN, QBasic, Visual Basic, Access, IBM Assembly language and several different opperating system languages. Never have spent so much time learning so little. These authors don't try to build a foundation that can be expanded. They present unexplained example after unexplained example. I belive the authors have never worked in java, I belive they have only compiled books on it. This book only shows how confused the authors are on the subject. I believe that they don't have a foundation for surely if they did, they would have presented it."
1,Obsolete and confusing,"This book was not a serious attempt to upgrade the 1996 version of this book which covered Java 1.0. It appears to be an attempt on making quick money by adding a few comments about Java 2. Many of the important aspects such as event handling use totally obsoleted methods from java 1.0. Event hanldling was pretty much replaced in Java 1.1, yet this book refers to Java 1.0 even though this book is supposed to be about Java 2 !! It caused me a great deal of trouble, since I started writing programs using obsolete methods. Don't waste your money on this."
2,A let down,"Pure frustration. Explanations are intermingled with irrelavant history lessons and pathetic jokes while not really explaining the subject. There is no natural learning progression as it jumps from basic method syntaxs to a highly complex code set. This book is neither a learning tool nor technical reference. Don't buy it, there must be better books!"
4,"Good for beginners, something for experts","An excellent criteria to apply to any book designed to teach a topic is that experienced teachers can find something to use in future lessons. Since I have taught Java for over three years and am currently teaching three sections using the JDK 1.3, I can humbly consider myself experienced in the language. There are two examples in the book that gave me the ideas for additional lessons that I have incorporated into my current classes.However, that does not mean that the material is too advanced for beginners. On the contrary, the initial position and the movement is ideal for someone just learning the language. Some of the material that is new and improved in the JDK 1.3 is examined, although not in detail.If you are in need of a book that will give you a quick overview of a language that you are unfamiliar with, then this book is a good choice if the language is Java. The examples are good, current and expressed in a form that is easy to understand."
1,Not recommended for beginning programmers,"This book does not try to help you if you are a beginner. It has codes which do not explain what the programming lines do, only what the program does. If you want a good java book and have no experience at all, get Java 2 by Ivor Horton."
5,I love my Pyrex mixing bowls!,"I received these as a gift for my wedding a few years ago and I love love them. They are surprisingly durable. I have dropped them on the floor more than once on accident and they have not broken. They come clean well in the dishwasher and I also use them in the microwave. What I like most about them is that they don't stain like plastic mixing bowls do.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,Unbeatable value and quality!,"Although a little high priced, this has got to be the best value for this type of mixing bowl on the market. Quality is unmatched, design is superb, just the right weight and shape to do it's job. Originally bought these for microwave popcorn popping (which they excel at) but they are turning out to be the go-to bowls for all kinds of cooking chores.Super fast shipping and super quality. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Un gran esfuerzo por la musica!,"Que gusto ver como artistas tan talentosos y prometedores como Diego Torres haciendo MTV's Unplugged para toda la comunidad Latinoamericana...Una mezcla de rock, flamenco, y sobre todo, los grandes ritmos caribenos invaden este cd haciendolo interesante, entretenido, y sobre todo, pegajoso....Aunque no todas las canciones son dignas de un Grammy Latino, si puedo decir que sus grandes exitos como ""Color Esperanza"", ""Tratar de estar mejor"", y ""Usted"" con Vicentito, son increibles...Obras maestras.Le recomiendo este disco a todos que quieran escuchar musica alegre y optimista, pero mas que nada, con todo el Color Esperanza del mundo...Bravo Diego!"
3,Boring but informative,"My mother recomended I read this book to learn more about our Don Cossak heritage. The portrait this book paints of the life my grandfather left behind makes me glad he did. I've checked with Russian friends who have mentioned the possibility that Sholokhov was forced to rewrite parts, to play down the happy aspects of that life. He did."
1,"great book, horrible story","I agree that the book is one of the greatest books from the Soviet Union. U do have to be careful with choosing right translation, but i have read it in Russian(original) and i hated it. I can't name another book that i dislike, I love reading, but this one... I don't know if it's because one has to be mature enough to comprehend the 'BIG LOVE"" this characters have for each other-i was 15 when first read it(now im in my 20es and l don't want to reread it). I probably am a little bit of a dreamer yet. I hate that Mikhail Sholokhov chose to write about adultery. very well written though"
4,The Best Egg Art Book,This book is full of pictures of beautiful eggs. Each egg has instruction. Amazing designs and ideas for egg artists. The author gives many useful tips and thecnics. The book is useful for every skill level. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is that it doesn't have any index or list of contents. The other thing is that sometimes for instructions on one egg you have to go back and forth between two pages. Overall it's an amazing book.
3,Very good!,"Small, in fact - you could almost say petite - this little gem from a mastermind Frenchman proves a savoury sampling of Stendahl's works. This one is all about love (dUh!). You should note though that it is written in Spanish."
5,not for children,"Utena is an INCREDIBLE series, and if you want to hear raves, you can read all the other reviews. The important thing to remember, about Utena and most anime is that it's NOT for children. The official review of this DVD lists it as appropriate for ages nine and up. Ridiculous! The plot, subplots, and characters are far too complex for children, and there are numerous violence and sexuality issues that are definitely not intended or appropriate for a juvenile audience. Utena is wonderful, but enjoy it for yourself, not for your kids!"
4,Way Better Than Sailor Moon,"The first time I saw Utena I was like, this is from the Sailor Moon people. The plot was so much better than SM and it seemed much more mature, if not a bit harder to understand. Well, I watched it a second time and I completely fell in love with one of the characters. I don't care if he is supposed to be three years younger than me, Miki is one of the coolest anime chara's I have ever seen, and the stop watch thing is soooo cute. If your a fan of anime, or someone who wants to see what all the hype is about, then this (and Fushigi Yuugi, my absolute fave anime) is for you. Believe me, you won't regret it!"
2,Strange anime?,"I've seen quite a many animes in my time, but Utena is definitely the strangest. I personally find it to fake to believe. It's cute and everything, just really REALLY strange. First time viewers may want to really consider trying this one before spending the money for it."
4,Recommended,"This CD contains a satisfying selection of Peggy Lee's more popular songs. The insert is straightforward with some good pictures of the singer at various points throughout her career, and detailed production information about each song. I would have liked to see some interesting tidbits/trivia about the singer herself . . . and also printed lyrics."
4,Good Choice,It's a good overall selection of Peggy Lee's songs. It's well balanced and gives a good overview of her various styles. I've enjoyed listening to them.
1,true story? not!,"This movie is a prime example of Hollywood taking a so-called 'true story' and completely twisting the facts to make it more entertaining. The producers attempt to justify this by saying it is 'based' on a 'true story'. This is like making a movie about Adolf Hitler and saying he killed a few people. If you do a little research about Henri Young, you'll find that he was hardly the innocent who in desperation stole $5. Also, unlike the ending in the movie, Henri Young did not die on Alcatraz. He was finally paroled from a prison in Washington in 1972 (!!!) after which he disappeared."
1,Pure B.S.,"I just did some research on-line of the Henri Young at Alcatraz facts. Go to Alcatrazhistory.com and see for yourselves that this movie was a COMPLETE fabrication of the truth. The movie claims that it was ""inspired"" by the true story of Henri Young, which is a slick way of trickery for which Hollywood is famous. Having said that, the acting and direction is very good; but the false propaganda by the liberal communist Left makes this film yet another slap in the face of the truth."
4,great day use glassware,I have used these glasses for many years as my everyday red wine for meals. One does have to be careful washing as the stems are more likely to break than the bowl - easy to twist off the stem when drying. Recommended.
2,Fails to deliver,"I found there to be no actual tape reading. Instead I found a grammatically poor book and the resultant struggling to re-read sentences to pinpoint what the author was trying to convey.I did enjoy his personal background/history. Half the book is taken up by this and the rest examples of his trading setups. The setups I found somewhat informative but that was not the reason for purchase.Going back to tape reading or rather the lack of. Rather than specific examples showing tape reading he merely inserts e.g. '...here we use tape reading to exit a position...' or '...using tape reading principles we look to short here...'.I'm disappointed. 2 stars may be a little generous, perhaps 1.5 stars."
5,Cholesterol Decoded,"For many folks, monitoring cholesterol has become a regular part of adult health care. Those lab report results can seem like raffle ticket numbers and none of us wants the boobie prize. To get the ""right"" cholesterol numbers, we are urged to change diet, lifestyle, exercise regimen, etc., and/or take drugs, but the outcome can seem as random as a raffle when the next lab results come in. This book gathers together a wealth of hard research about what the connection may and may not be between cholesterol levels and overall heart health. The Myth of Cholesterol also points toward what may be much more important heart health factors. I felt empowered after reading this book, both because I can now understand my lab report better myself and because I can also participate as an informed patient when I discuss this with my doctor. I found the book clear and easy to read. The subtitle for this book talks of ""dispelling the fear"" around cholesterol. It did for me."
3,Party Summer isn't that scary,"In the book Party Summer R. L. Stine starts the book out as an exciting vacation and a job at an old inn for a couple of teenagers looking to get away from home for the summer, but things turn out the worst. In the book there are four teenager characters that have disagreements and one of the teenagers is studying witchcraft. They go to the inn and find out that the inn has been closed for remodelling. Then people start disappearing and people start being chased, in the end it's a matter of life or death, will they come out alive? I recommend this book to younger kids into the horror things. I liked it but it wasn't that scary. I like scary books like Stephen Kings Pet Cemetery; though this was a good book."
3,"Scary, huh?","'Party summer' is a thriller that I can assure you would love. Maybe you find it confusing, but later on you will understand everything perfectly, so I don't recommend you to star reading the book but then you must finish it 'cause you won't get it.When I started reading this book, by the way amazing, I fin it a little bit boring... But in the middle.... Oh, my God! It was really suspenseful and I just couldn't stop! I totally advice you reading it, you will extremely enjoy it! It is for all ages, but specially for teens!I hope it helped you."
1,What a Party!,"Four teens trek up to a supposedly hauntel hotel to fix it up, find a cave inside it, and are hunted down by a psychotic butler with multiple personalities and a big gun. The first in the SUPER CHILLER division of FEAR STREET is boring to no explaination point, the suspense is all padded and muffled, and the ending is stupid. And to top all of this, it's extremely long."
1,"Slow, boring, tasteless, timewasting.",The story may have started out well in the first chapter or two but began to sink as the story grew deeper. A few intriguing twists along the way but nothing that deserves anything above one and a half stars. * 1/2
2,Not the complete letter!!!,"I'm giving this edition of a wonderful work two stars because there is no warning that it's censored!! I had to read this for a class and was clueless about some of the things other students were talking about before I realized I hadn't gotten the whole text.Granted, what I did get was lovely and heartbreaking, but I now realize I wasn't getting the whole story.Amazon, please give some kind of warning that this is a censored version for people who wish to buy it in the future!"
1,Disgusted (This product is untrustworthy),"I baked a small batch of brownies at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and then took it out of the oven. *AS* I was walking past the dish it exploded through out my entire kitchen. My counter, floor and feet were covered in hot glass. I'm thankful my children were not in the kitchen at that time since they were excited to have brownies for dessert and had JUST left the room. I gave this a one star rating, I would go lower if I could. It's not trustworthy and makes me VERY wary of using ANY dish made by this company. As a matter of fact, I will never buy from them again."
1,Brand New Pyrex Dish Exploded in Oven,"I have used Pyrex for years and always thought these dishes were pretty durable. Today I bought a new one, filled it with cake mix at room temperature, and placed it in a 350 degree oven. It exploded about 15 minutes later, leaving shards of glass everywhere in a major league mess. After a Google search, I was shocked to find that there are numerous reports about exploding Pyrex. Apparently the official explanation has something to do with thermal shock, but why would you sell a dish for baking if it's subject to thermal shock? I'm swearing off the product and feel I must warn others."
5,The Rancher takes a wife,"An amazing story-a continuation of the previous books. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes outdoor, historical stories. along with the other 2 books."
4,Long awaited,"We enjoyed it thoroughly, found it just as funny as when I first saw it over 25yrs ago. A previous reviewer complained that the image quality was bad, something akin to a copy of a bad VHS tape. We found it just fine, SD to be sure, but still good quality. I guess if you've gotten used to Blu-ray resolution you might be disappointed.We found ""Robin Hood"" a bit lame, but then again I bought the disc for ""A Christmas Carol""."
3,Great movie looks like recored from old VCR tape,"I bought this for my dad because he likes watching it every year and it is a great show. I looked around for a long time to find the DVD version and I was excited to get it but the excitement was soon over after I watch the DVD and the Video and Audio are as if you were watch an old warn out VCR tape, I thought for the high price of this item that it was professionally premastered but it not. You could get the same quality by just recording the VCR version onto a DVD. If you don't have the VCR version I guess I might buy the DVD then."
3,Was it the shoe or my feet?,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
3,moc's review,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
5,This is Blues Explosion,"This is no deviation. This is the realization of what they were trying to do with previous albums. The Blues Explosion has always been about being bombastic and ridiculous, poking fun at the id of rock, which is the id of music, and thus embodying it. Distilled swagger, more image less substance. What has less substance, more image, and more swagger than samples and layered production?The lyrics are the album's real strength, coherent without sacrificing the band's chaos, the best of any Blues Explosion album. Nothing profound or particularly original, just simple rock themes distorted through the Explosion's filter.Have been burning all my CDs to the massive HD lately; few albums get more than 3-5 songs burned. This one gets 12. BTW,if you ever have the opportunity, this band is one of the best live bands around."
5,A Primer of ecclesiastical Latin.,"This is just one of the books that is a great help for those that want to learn LATIN (ECCLESIASTICAL). It has vocabulary, pronouciations etc. Ecclesiastical Latin is how the mass was said prior to Vatican two. You can find it at Amazon. I give it a five stars."
2,Try Another Text,"I found Dr. Brown, in conjunction with Dr. Churchill, to have written a very dry and non-useful text. It fails to provide the undergraduate student with the resources and background information that more highly touted books offer. There are a few examples that are somewhat helpful, but overall I found myself having to use reference texts to supplement this one. I am not a math major, but am continually searching for good math texts to help me grasp the fundamentals of more difficult topics. I did not find that help here. Too much 'math prose' and not enough to-the-point definitions and examples, which is the cry of every non-math major. Their treatment of the Laplacian is not even worth the bother of placing it in the book. The physical size of the book is small, (9 1/2 by 6"") with 335 pages. Not nearly enough for the treatment of its titled subject."
2,I almost took it back,"I was somewhat dissapointed by this CD. I have Strangest Places, and I think that this CD doesn't even come close in terms of energy. What drew me to Strangest Places was the guitars and the more pop-rock that many of the songs have. This CD, while it's good, is just not something that is easy to get in to. The songs are so melancholy and slow that they can almost depress you. There's none of the rock element in it, and it's just on overall quieter release. If you want something by Abra Moore, get Strangest Places."
5,unique insight,"Studies today revolve around body image and ignore the emotions and thoght processes vital to understanding eating disorders. Bruch brilliantly describes what it is to suffer from these wayward thought processes, and offers an incredibly insightful and intimate look into the world of an anorexic. Excellent for those who are suffers and for those trying to understand."
5,"Awesome, I love this stuff.","I love this lotion so much. It's cheap, it smells amazing (like hot chocolate!), and it does a great job. What more can you ask?"
1,Worse MP3 Player Ever,"I bought this item new at the store when it first came out. I also bought my girlfriend one and bought upgraded memory while I was there. Figuring out exactly how to get this unit to work and run properly in itself takes at least an hour unless your very computer literate, then trying to figure out how to put songs into the MP3 player is atleast another few hours. The instructions ""are bad"", the set up is very complicated and the overall unit is very UN user friendly. The unit constantly gives errors and is about the most frustrating thing I have ever worked with ever. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone and if you just must have one...I will gladly send you mine cuz thats how little I think of it. Oh and try and look up any number you can call for support on this product or ask questions about it...you will never get anyone. Save your money and buy ANYTHING else. I would take a tape player over this ... ."
1,BEWARE - IT WILL TRASH YOUR SMARTMEDIA CARD,This MP3 players works just fine but I gave it a one star because it will format your smartmedia card so it can only be used with this MP3 player and there is no way to restore the card to its original formatting once you used it in this player. I now have to purchase another smartmedia card for my digital camera because this ... MP3 player trashed my smartmedia card and d-link could care less.
2,Nice but Please...,"Ok, so Riedel Vinum Port Glasses are in fact beautiful, I certainly don't dispute that. When I saw them in the store I thought, ""that's exactly what I'm looking for."" $21 a piece ($85 for six or whatever it is), a little steep but I'll bite the bullet and get 'em. Then I picked them up. Why would someone design such a beautiful glass (or anything for that matter) and insist on putting their name on it. Tacky. I don't advertise at my dinner table. As a professionally trained chef I recommend going for the official port glass, authorized by the IVP - Instituto do Vinho do Porto and designed by world acclaimed Portuguese architect Siza Vieira. <$37. I believe they ship from Europe so it may take a few to get them here in the states...mine are on the way."
4,"New Vocals, New success.","When i heard that adagio had taken on a death metal singer, i didnt think it would work(i mean how can you beat opeth), though when i listened to teh album,i was pleasently surprised. Songs like ""fire forever"" and ""terror jungle"" made the album definately worth the while. The changed their style to fit the new vocals slightly, and it actually worked. Iv'e found online that lots of people complain about the cover song ""fame"", saying it was too cheesy and not in adagio's style. But how about looking at it differently. Dont compare it to adagio normally, compare it to itself - the good, the bad, just because it isnt the same style as the other songs on the album doesnt mean its a bad song, yeh its cheesy, yeh its a cover, but it still sounds cool and a lot better than the original! If you judge it by it being dissimilar to other songs, then how did dream theater make any success!?"
2,Warning - this is not the Adagio we've come to love.,"This release is SO different from Sanctus Ignis and Underworld. Rarely do they recapture their fantastic orchestral sound. Missing are the challenging rhythms. Gone are the great choral sounding segments. Instead they've added a singer who growls and snarls way too much, despite having a good singing voice. And they did a cover song of the theme from FAME? Worst idea I've ever heard. It makes me sad. They tried to go darker, and it doesn't work. Adagio's first 2 albums will remain in my heavy disc rotation for many more years. Dominate will not."
2,Not for the kids!,"The movie stars Kirk Douglas and is based on a book by Jules Verne, but parents expecting another 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA will be in for a surprise. It is very violent and includes things like torture and a gang-rape that are totally inappropriate for kids. Adults will find a well-acted but slow moving adventure story. The scenery is beautiful but the movie has a low budget look and feel. And the DVD has no bonus features, not even the theatrical trailer. Pricey for a DVD with no bells and whistles."
4,one of a kind,"ive went through 4 or 5 of these. why? because there has yet to be a bettter analog dpad. the only problem with this gamepad is the way its made internally. the switches on the dpad wear out too fast..the soft rubber pads inside get beat up by the hard plastic dpad...ive taken many apart. but its awesome while its working, if you like to control your car with a dpad like me.soooo..i just keep buying :)"
4,"Surprisingly, not too annoying!","Okay, we haven't had this phone long. But it isn't too loud, and it makes a variety of sounds instead of just a couple annoying ones. It rings with different tones (just phone sounds on the learning mode; the fun mode has three songs--""The Farmer in the Dell,"" ""A Tisket, a Tasket"" [or maybe it's ""Ring around the Rosie""] and ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"") and also plays snippets of conversation or a voice speaking the names of numbers that are pressed. In the fun mode, red lights flash in the green frame around the screen; in the learning mode, red digital numbers light up on the screen.Our 13-month-old sat down on the floor of the store to play with the toy until we took it away from him, and he played with it more in the car and at home. I'm hoping it will distract him from our cordless phone.We haven't found an on/off button, but the sound is quiet enough that I'm not too worried about it."
4,Nick Lowe AND Ry Cooder,"One thing other reviewers have missed is that Ry Cooder's typically-awesome guitar work adorns a few of the tracks (Gaijin Man, Rocky Road, and a couple others). Some of these songs are great, and the whole thing is fun."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm sure Nick Lowe is a master at his craft. But I just had to write and warn that all the songs on this album are not like ""All Men Are Liars"". I got this album on the strength of that song -- not just on the lyrics but also the beauty of the tune itself. Unfortunately, I found that the rest of the songs are pretty average rockabilly fare, even if the lyrics are witty. I appreciate the tongue-in-cheek song as much as the next person, but I also like to have a good tune to listen to when I can't pay attention to the lyrics. Although I must say that I found ""What's Shakin' on the Hill"" and ""You Stabbed Me In the Front"" to be pretty nice. Sorry to bring the average down!"
4,Go Wanda!,"I like Wanda and I would give her 5 stars. The reason I didnt is due to how she moves.I have a 15' above ground intex vinyl pool with the upgraded salt water system(stronger pump). It has a few small bumps and wrinkles on the bottom. VerY LITTLE! She still likes to get hung up on them sometimes. And she moves in circles when she does go, but seems to keep doing circle in the same area and not getting around the pool more. Seems if she go straight across then turn it would do more.Other than that she gets the job done! I really only have fine dirt at the bottom of my pool. But she gets it up and send it to the filter! She has also picked up some bigger bugs and other things that get to the bottom."
1,PARANOID USER,Last year I bought this vacuum and used it on a weely basis to clean my pool all summer long it did a very nice job of cleaning.after the summer ended my liner had a leak in it the pool is only 5 years old all the other summers used a manual vacumm which is a lot of work but never had a problem with the pool leaking I had to replace the liner a $[...] job needless to say I went back to manual vacuuming. Might be coincidence I am just paranoid to ever use it again I am selling it
3,does a pretty good job,it needs a little attention once in a while but does an ok job. it is very well built. a pretty good value
4,Diver Dave,Diver dave works great. Just attach it to your skimmer port and he will keep your pool clean.
3,The Vacuum was ok but had issues with the seller,This is a cute and good working vacuum but I didnt get all the parts and was a huge hassle to get the missing part. Had to wait another 2 weeks before I could even use my Wanda. But I couldnt be more happy now that she is up and going. Only disappointment is it doesnt take much for her to stop moving (like 1-2 small leaves) and you have to clean the debris out of your skimmer net.
3,Good for the price,This works ok and is a good deal for the price. Saves me a lot of time from doing it myself. For some reason it doesn't get about 1/4 of the pool and I have to physically move it to that area for it to get the rest of the dirt there. Otherwise it works good.FYI: I have an intex pool 18' and the stock pump will not drive this vacuum very well if at all. I recently bought a Hayward 1.5hp pump and cartridge filter which is huge improvement.
1,NO GOOD FOR INTEX POOLS,"This little cleaner hooks up to the intex above ground pool but it goes around in circles and coils the hose in 3-4 circles and then it just stopsfurthermore when the cleaner hits the edge of the pool where it has a radius it gets stuck or falls over and takes a while to get going, if the bottom of the pool is not VERY flat then it will just kinda bounce along the bottom also from time to time the traveler feet just stop working altogether, dont waste your time with this. i gave it a good chance to prove itself and ended up having to take it back."
4,Effective,"I have a 24' above ground pool with a pretty smooth bottom. My daughter put the unit in the pool the first time. It seemed to stay to one side of the pool and took a long time ( more then the 2 hrs noted on other reviews). The next time I put the unit in the pool but did not use the entire length of the hose since longer then needed. The unit moved around the entire pool without any manuvering this time. I found the unit to be effective and certainly easier then manual vac. So, if not in a hurry, pop it in a let it go.Thanks"
3,Better suited for a COMPLETELY flat pool.,"If you have clumps of dirt, grass, etc. underneath your pool this may not be the cleaner you need. Although it is capable of getting itself unstuck, this cleaner gets caught easily. It moves VERY slow. Some reviewers state that it cleaned their pool in a few hours, however this was not the case for us. We left it running all night and roughly 30% to 40% of the pool wasn't touched. It is hard for me to recommend because I don't know how it would do on a flat surface. I can, however, say that the area it moved over DID get clean. Just don't expect the job to get done quickly. You almost have to stare at it to see if it is really moving.One other note: This was MUCH bigger than it looks in the picture (roughly the size of a bowling ball)."
2,Just okay performance,"I'm on my second Aquabug. First one came with the pool, but broke after 1 year. When it was working, it did okay - cleaned the pool pretty well in about 2-3 hours. I got another one without spending time looking for alternatives, and this one works just okay also. I leave it in all morning, and when I go out it looks good except for some spots it missed. I always have to use the hand-held vaccum to finish the job. I'd like to find a product that would really do a great job, but don't want to spend over $100 to try any others at this point."
2,cheaply made,The hose that comes with the Aqua Bug is in sections. They don't screw together they just nest inside each other. Which means they come apart at will. There is no easy way to get the thing out of the pool. If you pull the hose it pops out. If you pull by the bottom and put too much pressure on the black ring it pops off. There is what appears to be a handle on the top but it is not big enough to get a grip on a giant waterfilled bug.There are some spots on the pool floor that aren't perfectly level so the bug avoids them. I was desperate for a vacuum so I'll keep it but I feel like I was ripped off.
4,pretty good but not perfect,We have a 15' Intex metal frame pool. This year I was having a heck of a time keeping it clean so I decided to give the critter a try. First off let me say for you other Intex owners - if you have the stock paper filter pump GET RID OF IT. It does not have the adequate flow to operate the critter. And if it does happen to get it to move around your filter will be plugged in no time rendering the critter motionless. I upgraded to a sand filter and this baby flys across the bottom now. It did a pretty good job cleaning the bottom - not perfect - some scrubbing was still required but hey it still saved me a ton of time. I'm still having trouble with it missing certain spots - I'm guessing it may have to do with the flow jet for the return water coming into the pool. I've adjusted the outlet water jet numerous times - oh well. Overall this thing is an easy 4 out of 5. Its not perfect like I said but its certainly a time saver.
4,Works great,Gave it a 4 because if it is windy out diver Dave will be pulled in the direction of the wind. Other than that he works great. Picks up everything on the bottom and keep my pool clean.I have not had any other issues and works as advertised.
4,Very pleased!,The reviews on this product were very helpful in our decision to purchase Wanda. As soon as she arrived yesterday we plugged her in. We just left her to clean for a few hours while we did yard work. We hadnt yet cleaned the pool since it was installed 2 weeks ago. What a great job she did!!! This will save my husband hours of cleaning. Love it.
4,We love Wanda!,"Wanda does a great job, and I won't go back to manual cleaning.She occasionally does lift off of the floor of the pool, but she always gets going again. Proper hose length use is essential in this.She does great with debris and light algae, and I wouldn't use her on anything heavier because of the toll on my filter. If not for the filter, I'm sure she could do the job.Set her in the pool, wait 2-3 hours, and you have a clean pool."
4,It works,"I was a bit skeptical of this product when I purchased it. I have an above ground oval pool (12x24) and wanted something that could clean the pool without me pushing the vacuum around. This product actually works well. Its pretty easy to set up and once it gets going, it does a pretty good job of cleaning the bottom of the pool. I gave it 4 stars because its not perfect. From time to time, it may miss small portions of your pool but for the most part, it does a good job. I would recommend it."
4,Works well...,"I bought this product for my husband to try. It's a little slow, but all in all it does a very good job!"
1,Transmitter!!! Picking Up Something Good!!!!,Lo ?nico bueno que puedo decir de este disco es que le dio el nombre al mejor grupo de la actualidad (Radiohead)....es todo.
2,"Buy it used, or save your money....","I only wish this were the masterpiece it could have been. A nice mastering of the original tapes would have been far, far better than this slightly thin re-recording of the originals. As another reviewer mentioned, the sound is far too clean as compared with the nice warm analog sound of the originals. The instrumentations are well done, but generally lacking any warmth or personality.Yes, I know many of you think that Wilson could gargle on tape and it would be a masterpiece, but his voice here does not compare with the originals, nor do you get the rest of the BBs. His voice here, as with the Pet Sounds Live, is sort of flat. It is better than on Pet Sounds Live, but still not where it needed to be to undertake this monster of a job.Basically, it is ok, but wait for a used copy and pick that up. You will undoubtedly spend more time listening to the more cohesive bootlegs than to this recording."
1,More a Smirk than a Smile,"I love the Beachboys but this production is far too 'operatic' for my taste.I like my rock to still rock but this is for ageing baby-boomers who have refined their taste to something more cultured.I wasn't looking for culture, just a happy walk down memory lane. The music is jarring and discordant much of the time with self-conscious harmonies and chorus singing."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"I'm glad that Brian Wilson finally exorcised his demons and released an official version of the SMiLE album. The original legend of SMiLE has been overblown and while the songs are good, none of them are the earth shattering except for the classic ""Good Vibrations"" and possibly, ""Heroes and Villians."" His version of ""You are My Sunshine"" is one of the eeriest covers of a song that I've ever heard. Overall I think it's an enjoyble album, but it never could have competed with what was being released at that time in the 60s, and that is why Brian dropped out of music for a while."
2,ARE YOU ALL KIDDING ME?,"I READ ALL 500 + REVIEWS OF THIS CD AND THEN WENT OUT AND PURCHASED IT. THEN I LISTENED TO IT. IT IS NOT VERY GOOD. WHAT DOES THE BEST ALBUM OF 2004 GET YOU THESE DAYS? THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE. GOOD MEANS GOOD IN ANY TYPE OF MUSIC. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE TOP 1000 ALBUMS IN ROCK/POP EVER. TAKE ABBEY ROAD, WHICH SOME REVIEWER SAID SMILE IS BETTER THAN. YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE 17 SONGS ON SMILE COMPARE TO THE 17(HOW ABOUT THAT) ON ABBEY ROAD??? IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT BRIAN'S SINGING IS SAID TO HURT THIS. BRIAN IN 1966 COULD NOT HAVE HELPED THIS. I LOVE MANY SONGS BY BRIAN, BUT HE HASN'T HAD AN ORIGINAL REALLY GOOD SONG SINCE ""IT'S O.K."" IN 1978. COME ON PEOPLE ; FACE REALITY!"
1,A nutshell review of Smile,"I'm a huge Beach Boys fan. Have been all my life. Huge Brian Wilson fan. Huge fan of the Smile songs from when Brian performed them 40 years ago. This CD is terrible simply because his singing, now, stinks. Brian's voice is awful. I understand the circumstances. His voice is still awful. I'll take ""Wonderful"" and ""Surf's Up"" from 40 years ago any day. This CD got one listen, and now it's ready to sell."
2,I Don't get it -,"My mother said to never criticize something you don't understand.O.K., I don't understand.I'll give this effort 5 stars for production, performance, effort and historical significance, and zero stars for personal entertainment value.I get more of a rush from Disneyland's Main Street Parade score.Congratulations to Mr. Wilson for purging his demons and resurrecting this odd fossil. I'm glad I could contribute 15 bucks to his therapy."
2,Soundtrack for an Insane Asylum,"I read lofty reviews for this in year-end ""best ofs"" and after checking it out of a library (thank god I didn't spend money on it) I have to check in as one of the many here scratching their head asking why on earth this received so many plaudits from the music press. It's a mess. I can't imagine anyone wanting to listen to this more than once. Several of the extended pieces will have you wishing you had a gun to kill yourself with as they are maddening. THIS is what the U.S. military should blare over loudspeakers next time it wants to depose one of its tinpot, puppet dictators out of their bunker because it is simply awful."
5,Smile,"After listening to this cd a bunch of times and watching the Showtime special about it's making, I would have to say Smile is a true American gem stone. Ive always been a big fan of The Beach Boys and Brian Wilson And this is his finest work ever. A special thanks to all the fine players that helped cultivate his creation. You should buy a copy of this cd, its history in the making."
5,I'm Left Without Words,After listening to Smile I am so amazed that I'm left without words-which isn't too good a condition for a reviewer to be in but I don't care.I'll simply say if you like music you should own Smile-it's that simple. Thank you Brian Wilson for having the courage to confront your demons and let us finally hear Smile.I do remember one quote from Dennis Wilson which has always stuck with me.He said that 'Smile was so good it made Pet Sounds suck'.I never fully understood that quote until today.Just listen to Smile for yourself and see if you don't agree--it's great!
5,Awesome movie!,Well worth the money spent. Great movie to add to my collection. Jessica Lange is truly a fabulous actress. Thanks
3,Review of DVD - Frances,"It would have been handy to know that I was not going to be able to play this DVD on my DVD player as the DVD is not set to the standard Australian Region setting...I had to hack into my DVD after searching online to find out how, to re-set my DVD player to a 0 Region setting so that I could finally play it. After purchasing and waiting a long time for delivery, this was not appreciated."
2,Poor Character Portrayal,"Jessica Lange does not capture the personality of Frances Farmer well at all: when not hysterical, Lange portrays Farmer as somewhat simpering, rather than the bold, brassy figure that Farmer actually was; but I don't entirely blame Lange for this huge character portrayal gaffe: When viewing the extra material on the DVD, it soon become QUITE clear that the makers of this movie were more interested in themselves than their actual subject matter: The extra material included is nothing but a bunch of mutual back-slapping among a few Hollywood yuppies, and the references to Farmer are very much extraneous."
5,GOOD DEAL,SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND WAS GLAD TOFIND IT WATCHING IT BROUGHT BACK SOME FOND TIMES IN MY LIFE
4,the california kid,"This movie kind of put '34 Fords on the map. I,m a car guy and I had to have this one for my collection. I thought it was well done. It was Nick Nolte's first movie and one of the few t.v. movies worth having."
5,10/100 versus Gigabit Protection,Purchased card and installed drivers provided on CD with product. Had problem with Ethernet LAN wiring that runs through my surge protection device APC BX1500LCD (which only supports 10/100 pass-through speed). Solution was to have Ethernet bypass APC BX1500LCD to allow Gigabit LAN speed. Purchasing an APC PNET1GB device to add RJ-45 protection back for PC. Keep this in mind when connecting you PC to switch / router if you are not getting Gigabit LAN after installing card and drivers from CD.
3,Giuliano on George,"Known as the ""Quite One"", George Harrison has hid himself from the public enigma for many years. Dark Horse lets everyone in on the man of mystery. In the 1980s, Geoffrey Giuliano lived in the unreal world of Harrison and his friends, and by doing this experienced many interviews that make up the basis for his lively and revealing portrait of George. The book contains descriptive summaries of Harrison's life in a very orderly manner. Its hard to learn and write about a life of such a highly private and religious man whose musical associates were far more interesting than he was, which is why I give this book credit. George Harrison is my favorite Beatle and I thought it would be fulfilling to read about his life. At times the author looked at George in a negative way, putting his bad characteristics at the surface. For this reason, I believe Dark Horse is probably not the most interesting rock biography out there, but is a great addition to any Beatle fans library."
4,Release Improvement,"Living in snow- bound Wisconsin I have the grips installed. They feel good but have not had the opportunity to try them out. The reason for my rating is that 12 of the grips were not wrapped, which is O.K., but one of the grips was wrapped and had slightly different (thinner) printing on the but end of the grip. I'm sure it will not affect anything, it was just something that I noticed"
1,Microsoft doesn't support their own products!,"I've been burned by Microsoft twice before with Sidewinder joysticks. The first time I bought one was when I had Windows 98. It was a Sidewinder Pro. Great joystick, plug n play, all that. When I migrated to Windows 2000, I found that the Sidewinder Pro was not supported (despite being analog--you'd think it would be easy to program drivers for it). I thought, ""Okay, maybe there are problems, blah blah blah."" I then bought a Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro, again, great product, plug n play, all that. Worked great. When I migrated again to Windows XP I found AGAIN it wasn't supported by Microsoft. There is NO reason why a company such as Microsoft cannot support their own products on their own operating system. I will NEVER buy a Sidewinder again. I can't trust them. Buy anything else. I've had great luck with the Wingman Digital Extreme--$$$ at ......--excellent buy!"
3,Sidwinder FF2 CD has problems with Vista,Bought this joystick with no CD. Aquired CD from another source & will not load in vista. Joystick by itself does work when plugged in to USB port. Without the CD you cannot profile the Joystick. Dissapointed but will deal with it. Still the best joystick in town.
5,Great joystick!!!,"Ive had this Joystick for about 5 years now (i dont remember exactly how long, but a couple months after it was on market), and its a great joystick!!. I used it with Windows ME at the beggining where i had to install drivers, but with windows XP i just plug it and use it, doesnt even need calibration. I've been abusing of it for about 5 years, and the only thing that im having trouble with is that the FOV move to the righ its a little hard, besides that, it works as well as the first day. I really recommend it."
1,Boooring,Not an easy book to read. With most CW books by the time I have read about 1/4 of the way through I sense a flow of words. I never got there with this book. I was disappointed the first time but actually read the book a second time to give it a chance. Unfortunately it didn't get any better. A more enjoyable treatment of Day 1 at Gettysburg is 'Gettysburg The First Day' by Harry W. Pfanz.Also recommended: Gettysburg The First Day by Harry Pfanz Covered with Glory by Rod Gragg The First Day at Gettysburg by Gary Gallagher
5,Fallen-Angels Series: Action-Packed Excitement!,"I couldn't put it down, I read it so fast! It's full of mystery and adventure- my kind of entertainment!"
1,Depressing album,Guys i love Anathema but not in their first albums . They are so depressing - dont hear this kind of music. Its not fun.
2,"Nice sound, a bit repetitive","Anathema, along with several others in the early to mid 90's helped defined the sound for doom metal. This album only touches the surface of the doom metal scene. The overall feel of the album (by about song 5 or 6) is boring. There are some songs that are definitely worth the listen such as ""Sweet Tears"". The album starts off fairly strong and quickly lapses into a boring repetition of the exact same melodies over and over again. If Anathema had been able to keep some of the energy of the earlier songs throughout this would have probably rated higher, but with the last half (at least) of the album being unbearable it will have to remain at 2 stars."
2,Not that Great,"Thermometer reads ok, handle doesn't hold on, tends to fall off, unit is too small to hold without handle attacted."
1,Disappointed,"I am surprised by how cheaply this thermometer is made for a price of $19. It does not appear to work correctly for the first time. The lights kept indicating an ""error"" on initial use. I opened the back cover, removed and replaced the battery with the same one, and still get multiple readings and an ""error"" message. The battery appears to have power and to work fine. The unit also seemed not to turn off until I realized that you must hold the ON/Off button down for 5 seconds or longer to turn off the unit. I tried to get a reading for grilled steaks and also ice water. It took well over 30 seconds to get a reading that seemed in the ballpark but the temp never held steady and the accuracy was highly questionable. To get a replacement through the warranty the product must be mailed to Mexico (there is no money-back policy). I would not recommend. I literally bought this based on the customer reviews I read on this site and I am surprised and disappointed. Maybe this one is just a dud."
5,This CD is bad as hell!!,"For those of you who are amazingly loyal pac fans like myself, this cd is a must, Jay-Z Die slow, let's be friends, the cd is good the whole way through"
1,Would NOT Recommend!,"Pirate Petite Sz 3T To 4T- So poorly made that the item does not even match the image included with the costume. The silver ribbon sewn onto the front of the dress was upside down and the bandana flaps were inside out, so they were black instead of red. The black boots that you slip over shoes are very cheap-looking shiny plastic. Straight out of the package, there were already snags in several areas of what's suppose to be sparkly material over the striped portion of the dress. Also runs smaller than you you may expect. Luckily, the seller quickly sent me a return label after I sent her photos of what I received. BE WARNED: Very cheaply made & cheap-looking costume!"
3,Spend your hard-earned money on the scotch,"I love Riedel glassware for wine, but these glasses are marginally better than low-cost glass tumblers for single malt scotch. Even the experts will tell you after the first two sips of scotch, the tongue is significantly anesthetized and cannot distinguish flavors as clearly as a fresh palate. If you want a truly sublime experience, I recommend spending your Riedel budget on that bottle of Macallan 18-year-old rather than these glasses."
2,"Beautiful Background, Frustrating Story.","I so wanted to love this book. And I tried. But try as I might, and as beautifully written as it was, I could not identify with the characters. We are given only the tiniest glimpse of the first encounter between a young woman and a cold male doctor, and from this un-rememberable encounter, we are supposed to believe that they are so wildly obsessed with each other that nothing can keep them apart. And yet - the doctor yells at the girl, insults her, chases her away - but feels sorry later, and tells his friend that he cannot be happy without her. And she - somehow presses on (and on, and on) in spite of his frightfully ugly spirit. If only their first encounter had been passionate or even exciting (!) I would have been able to believe the rest."
2,Disappointed,"This DVD was better than the 1st one that I purchased [Diary of Alicia Keys-Documentary, this was a real waste of my money], she is at least singing in this one! The product is not MTV material, it lacks a certain something, I felt that there was something missing in watching this DVD. It could be my fault because I was expecting the DVD to match the quality of her music.Why can she not make a home version of a DVD that are played on MTV, they look and feel so much better than this DVD was. Unless I have a guest over who likes her, I will achieve the DVD because it is not worth watching again.One day I hope to purchase a DVD from her that has that certain something where the DVD is really unplugged!"
2,First Hand Listener,"They have some promise but too much inconsistency. I've seen them live and wasn't too impressed. The San Diego local hit of 'Catch My Breath' is really all this is worth. As for being the best band to come from San Diego area as one reviewer noted, I don't think so! Bands such as Superunloader, Steve Poltz, Wise Monkey Orchestra, Mower, P.O.D. and Unwritten Law (to name more than a few), although very different from one another, sound much much better than this. Maybe a few years from now I'll eat my words but for now I wouldn't bet on it."
2,BORING,"Please teachers, don't assign this book as required reading. It put me to sleep everytime I tried to read it."
5,No More Lies,"Today in America, we are faced with a problem, and to understand that problem this book is here to assist. Professor Robison does a spectacular job in prooving there is an association of the most vial, perverse and disgusting humans to destroy Christianity and all governments throughout the World. This group he speaks of is still in existence, read the book and you too will know they exist. Just look around when you're finished reading this, keep reading on conspiracy and everything will fall into place a bit more easily."
5,fanstastic lyrics and a wonderful musical journey,"well, first thing to notice is Mark's improved voice and singing. Now he is a true singer, no doubt!!!second, the musical direction has changed a bit but so subtly that you just feel it is perfect bliss (or shangri-la).to be serious, this album present us with a fantastic story telling style, Mark is a great writer, no question!!! (5.15 AM, BOOM LIKE THAT, STAND UP GUY, DONT CRASH THE AMBULANCE, SONG FOR SONNY LISTON...) These songs tell stories, sometimes in a sarcastic way, but it's so refine!!! wow!Listen and enjoy the magic of POSTCARDS FROM PARAGUAY, 5.15 AM, TRAWLERMANS SONG, SUCKER ROW, DONT CRASH THE AMBULANCE, STAND UP GUY...This album is an invitation to simple life, there is a true philosophic thread throughout, which means it cannot bring you to be jaded.Mark is one of the last geniuses in pop rock music, so let yourself be taken away by this cool wave of enjoyment."
2,Instantly Forgettable,"I have been a huge fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits since the late 1970's and this, in my opinion, is perhaps the worst thing he has ever put out. The entire cd (with the exception of ""Boom, Like That"") is mellow to the point of it being boring, with no sign of Knopfler's signature guitar work. I bought this cd based on the Amazon review that said this was Knopfler's ""most rocking album since his days in Dire Straits"". What were they listening to? This is untrue and misleading. I would give anything for new material that even comes close to songs such as ""Telegraph Road"", ""Tunnel Of Love"", or even ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". Maybe Knopfler is just getting to old to really rock anymore."
5,Where is the interview?,"I have played both discs on my High End Pioneer system, and I am under the impression that there is an interview on the DVD-A.Can't find it.Any ideas please.Being a Lonnie Donegan fanatic this is the first mention of him by a musical artist.The first on the British scene with American spirituals Lonnie turned them into great hits before any of the big names of the sixties arrived.Thanks Mark"
5,Couldn't ask for more,Picked this up for the DVD-Audio and I am not dissapointed. I saw another review that said the songs are incomplete and are in Stereo... they're complete and in full surround sound (it needs to be selected in the Set Up menu). Sound quality is great. I don't really care about extra features like interviews and lyrics - 5 stars for being a great album and great sound quality. I've been to Mark Knopfler concerts that had much poorer sound than this disc!
1,Long awaited and very disappointing,Why does the best guitar player in the world and one of the worst vocalists continue to produce this kind of drivel? This guy could produce the all time best instrumental guitar album if he wanted to but instead we get this kind of junk. There aren't even enough break out guitar riffs to justify listening to this thing twice. I put my copy of Shagri La in the trash.The reviewer who called this a 'Rocking' album must not have listened to it.
1,Boom Like That is the only good song!,Boom Like That is the only good song on this poor made CD! DireStraits are way better!!!
3,Quite alot of depth,"It's quite advanced and if you can understand the math and topics presented, you likely didnt need this book in the first place."
1,Not happy with the way it looks,"I bought this item with the hope of putting it up on 200 houses in our condiminium complex. It went to a review of the Board and the comments I got were not very good on the looks of the item. The size, price, and numbers are perfect but the look is not. Can it be made just as a plain sign without all the decorations on it? I have been working on this project fo 2 years trying to find something suitable for our houses.PLEASE HELP ME FIND SOMETHING!!!!! Thank you."
3,walking the edge - robert forster,i first took notice of robert forster with his reading of an elmore leonard story - had to see some of his earlier works - very good
5,Quality,K&N makes a great product. Love the nut on the end of the filter. Great price on Amazon! Recommend this to all my friends
3,"Defective filter, great customer service","I'm sure these filters are great. I installed one on my Harley and it leaked. I removed the filter to find that the seal had separated from the filter. I was able to return it to Amazon for a replacement-which I haven't installed yet- the customer service was great, very simple transaction."
5,Supurb,One of the best documentaries Ive seen! Fantastic visuals for all ages! It truly highlights the beauty and diversity of the strange creatures in our oceans. Truly beautiful!
5,Amazing,"If you can't get a diving crew and gear to visit the most remote and most beautiful underwater scenery check this movie out. Stunning footage of the vast and amazing sea creatures known to man, and some I have never heard about. This was a spectaculor documentry, combined with 1080p HD and this was a beautiful picture."
4,Beautiful footage!,"Since this DVD is only 40 minutes long I passed on buying it, but it is absolutely worth the rental fee. The footage is up to the usual breathtaking IMAX standards. Crytal clear and with vibrant colors even on the small 19 inch set I watched it on. If you've watched any number of undersea documentaries, you're probably already familiar with most of the sealife that is covered, but again it's the visuals that make this so breathtaking as well as the message that much of this life is being destroyed by man (as usual) and most be conserved. I highly recommend it. The only reason I rate the DVD with 4 stars rather than 5 is that it's not even an hour long and there are no bonus materials what so ever. But the 40 minutes are well worth the a rental."
1,Beware. This is not 3d blu ray,"Even though this pops up when you search Amazon for blu ray 3d, it is not 3d. It isn't even Blu-ray. Unfortunately I was misled by the fact that all the customer reviews were for the 3d blu ray version. As a result I will be out $3 in return postage. Not Good Amazon. This should not be coming up when people are searching for 3d blu ray, should it?"
4,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.In addition to the title scenes 5 more out of screen effects extend an impressive 50% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Another 20 reached 25% or more and many are in the 5 to 10% range.EXCESS PARALLAX in a few of the scenes make it hard to mentally assemble the 3D.Far better than Wild Ocean in every respect*** Visually stunning sea floor & creature footage in crystal clear 3D ***MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
5,GREAT FOR KIDS!,"I purchased this for my students (4-7yr olds) and they love it. It is appropriate for their age and they are amazed by the animals. The narration is wonderful and explains to the viewer what you are seeing. They cover symbiotic relationships, different saltwater habitats, animal diets, and predator/prey. Not only do the kids love it...I do too!!"
5,Like being there,"I loved it, the water is crystal clear, the different creatures and life that were addressed were fascinating, and educational. The narration was very well timed. The notes of humor were appreciated.It is a great IMAX film, as always wish it were longer!!!"
3,Not as deep as Blue Planet,"This film will be appealing to youngsters because of its lovely photography. However, if you want to learn about the real deep, get the Blue Planet -Seas of Life Part 2 - THE DEEP.The Blue Planet - Seas of Life (Part 2)"
3,received item quickly and on time..,Memorex however is not recommended by drive manufacturers and i have created many coasters.. Will be ordering another brand.. Not worth a return hassle..
2,Beginner's Maori,"not very user friendly. i was hoping to open the book and be able to find every day phrases. instead it was broken down by grammatical points. i suppose it explains things well, but it takes a lot of time and focus - not for someone planning on visiting there soon and hoping to learn the basics."
5,This came quickly,"I ordered the best of Alec Baldwin, on Saturday Night Live, I received this way before the date it was supposed to arrive, I was very happy, the product was in Excellent shape too,! Andy Corona"
5,As funny as you remember it,"Great DVD to add to your probably growing collection of SNL ""Best of..."". Baldwin is one of the best and funniest guest hosts they ever had - nearly every sketch is a ""classic"" and as funny as you remember it (think ""Pete Schweady"")."
4,Spoken Word Royalty,"Anyone who has read my reviews in regards to Lydia's body of work can tell that I have a love/hate/obsessive reaction to her artistic cartharsis. This particular piece Memory and Madness is pretty good, not as great as Rude Hieroglyphics or Oral Fixation. Yet this is still way better than her music and books. Lydia Lunch's genius and talent is in her spoken word. She will always reign supreme to anyone and everyone who attempts at this particular type of artistic expression."
3,just ok,"Well.,.,.,.,.,.,.,..,.,.,.,.you can tell it is from a 1st Time director. Meaning, he needs a lot more practice. I actually purchased this movie. I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is ok to rent, not to pay for it. The story line was good. However, the direction and some of the acting was very very poor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Solid offering but sags slighty in the middle,"Like Frank, I grew up Catholic, so I greatly enjoyed his account of his childhood and the deftness at which he relayed the characters and situations of his life in early 20th century Northern Ireland. The account of his father's alcoholism and mother's strength in her modesty evokes powerful sentiments that O'Connor is amazingly skilled at.He overly criticizes the adolescent ideations and development out of his youth (bildungsroman), but it gives insight to his development as a writer (kunstlerroman), of which he is a candid and lucid artist.I felt the novel creeping a bit in the middle (otherwise I would give it 4 or 5 stars), and the transition is a bit murky to his engaging recount of actions against the British occupation of Northern Ireland and surrounding religious strife. The ridiculous skirmishes and characters are painted with his masterful brush, however, and truly bring the era to life.It is a story worth the read to the end on many levels."
3,Sizes run small,"The quality overall is very good, but be aware that these jerseys run a bit toward the small end. My wife typically wears ""medium"" sized tops as she is fairly thin and petite. This jersey ""just"" fit in terms of shoulder room ... and especially length ... barely reaching her waistline (and she's only 5' Ft. 4"" tall!) If your not sure on size .... size ""up""!"
2,"Bring Richard back, Mr. Kent!","This novel is tagged as a Richard Bolitho novel. It's not. Mr. Kent chose to kill Richard Bolitho off two novels ago and left us with his whining nephew, Adam, who annoyed me from the very beginning. I'd been reading of Richard's many and varied adventures for 25 years and Mr. Kent kills him off in one paragraph!? How did faithful, loyal Allday feel? Who knows? Mr. Kent chose to totally disregard his friendship with Richard. I was so disgusted I donated the book to my local library. Adam is a whiner. The women in Kent's latest novels have the men wrapped around their little fingers. Geez! Where's the fabulous comraderie of the earlier novels, the triumphant battles and the agony of defeat? Also, he killed off most of the wonderful characters I so enjoyed (thank goodness dear Allday was spared, the *only* character left I can empathize with). So no. I will not read another Adam novel."
3,Too introspective,"I've read nearly all the Bolitho books and have high regard for Kent/Reeman...but this volume irks me. The characters all seem so introspective. They obsess over everything they hear and even pick apart what they themselves say. The characters appear to be so joyless, even tragic. I don't care for O'Brien's books but at least Captain Aubrey seems to love serving the Navy and regularly expresses joy and delight...whereas Adam (and often his uncle Richard) are so serious and joyless that it begins to affect the reader. Even when Adam is in love, he still over-thinks every word, gesture, and nuance. In a word, everyone seems so miserable. There are many wonderful things I could say about the Bolitho saga, particularly the lessons learned about leadership and loyalty. To those new to the series, stick with the earlier books, which are gems, and go on to read Reeman."
1,This should have been wrote into a book.,Very Low budget and the actors are horrible. The title and cover looks good but this movie will make you upset after purchasing.
1,Going to Try Microsoft Money,"I have been using Quicken longer than I can remember. But like most of the recent reviewers here, I learned that Intuit will DISABLE the online download in Quicken 2004. In other words, one of the MOST IMPORTANT feature/reason you buy a money management software will be disabled three years after its release, forcing you to upgrade and give Intuit more money. I can understand if they won't support the product anymore, but blatantly disabling critical features is NOT acceptable. Imagine using Windows 98, and Microsoft decides you cannot surf the web anymore after 3 years, forcing you to buy Windows XP. I was considering upgrading but after reading all the problems/bugs it has from other reviews, I have decided not to send any more money to Intuit in protest.I hope Intuit read these reviews and is realizing they are losing their loyal customers. This is really bad and unethical business practices. I am guessing there will be a class action lawsuit soon."
3,I quit upgrading,I quit upgrading a few years ago. Seems like all they did was change the user interface and confuse me and add features related to them selling you more services.
1,I hate Quicken and their bullying tactics,I hate when companies force me to buy their useless upgrades for no reason other then shelling more money. Shame on Quicken. Really. I have to rethink my online banking.
2,Bugs with B of A,"I bought this program in hopes to keep track of my finances easily. I figured since most of my accounts have online access, Quicken would easily retrieve this information and publish it. This was not the case, you need to input a lot of data yourself, and I found that alot of times transactions on my Bank of America account would be lost.I contacted Quicken tech support and they admitted that this is a known problem with Bank of America accounts!!Needless to say, I took them up on their money back guarantee. Hopefully this will work better for other bank accounts."
1,2004 user,I have been using Quicken for 9yrs now and have found it to be a good solutions for keeping track of finances etc. I've upgraded several times over 9yrs and had problems a few times but generally it has worked fine. I just received a notice in the mail indicating that Quicken 2004 will no longer be supported by April of 2007. Given the number of legitimate bugs in the 07 release this company has some nerve driving customers to upgrade from versions as new as 04. Given the amount of time and pain it could take to make the conversion and hours spent on the phone dealing with some tech support guy that speaks broken english in India I think this company is going to cut its throat. It's pretty clear based on all the feeback that they have big issues with the initial release of 07 and are forcing good customers to make the leap. I'm going to upgrade to 06 and see how that goes
2,Intuit has lost its way,"I have been a Quicken user for 13 years. I upgraded to 2007 and it lost some of my data during the conversion. After several hours with support (live chat) they never found a solution.Then they say to call them and Intuit wants to charge me twenty four dollars to get assistance for their bug. Sorry Intuit, you have gotten too big and have forgotten the customers who made you. Over the last few years your customer service has gotten worse. You just don't care anymore. I think it may be time for me to move on to other vendors.If you are happy with your current, reliable, Quicken version stick with it. I was on 2002 and am going back to it. However, I think I will try out some of Quickens competitors. Never thought I would say that as a huge Quicken fan."
1,What fun!,"I finally started enjoying this software when I realized it's not really a financial management software program, it's a computer game! Save the princess? Nah. Quicken has a much more exciting challenge: FIND YOUR MONEY!The action starts right at the first level, when you think you've downloaded your banking transactions. Your mission: find the missing 2-week gap in your account info!Level two gets even more exciting as the big red numbers start to show up. You're faced with that all-important question: does the bank know my checking account is overdrawn $30,000?Me, I've advanced to the level where I have to find the necromancer to decipher why Quicken thinks even my savings accounts are overdrawn by several thousand dollars.If I can ever bring myself to stop playing this addictive game, I think I'll go back to using Excel spreadsheets for my finances. Microsoft Money's reviews sure don't look any better than Quicken."
1,Support from Intuit is absolutely useless!!!,"Don't get this software and expect to be able to convert your data from a MAC to a Windows based PC! I have been trying for over a week now and the online chat support was absolutely useless! He treated me as if I had no knowledge of how to even turn on a computer, much less how to see if a file is on a disc! I have used Quicken since the late 90's, but I will switch in a heartbeat after this experience!"
1,protest and buy 2006 Quicken,Fight back and buy quicken 2006 while there still supplies. the cost is about $22
1,Product should have not been released.,"I have been using Quicken since a very early DOS version and recently upgraded from Quicken 2004 to 2007 Delux. I have the latest patches and yet when I click to Print the program just closes. Aparantly many others have the same issue from what I have read on varrious user sites. Intuit does not have a direct answer to fix this; it is a series of ""try this & if that dosn't work try this"", many of which are uninstalling & chaging existing printer drivers. All of that sound risky when my printers work fine for everything else I really don't want to ""mess around with existing drivers"". Others who have gone through tech support to resolve issues with Quicken 2007 have spent many hours and some even days to get their issues resolved. I can not spend that much time, I am forced to switch to MS Money."
2,Works great... Until the warenty runs out,This product worked perfectly until the very day the warenty ran out. After that it stoped working all togather. I was on the phone with tech support (long distance) for an hour before i was informed that i will have to send the hard drive back to them to have it repaired (shipping and repairs both at my expence). 130 bucks may seem like a good deal but after all these expences it is more like 190 bucks. Not to mention all of the information that was on the hard drive is now lost.
2,Communication Problems,"I have had this drive for approximately 1.5 years and have kept various versions of the drivers. With some of the older drivers, I can get almost functional data backup, but with the most recent driver, I almost always lock up the drive after backing up 250 mBytes of data or so.My advice is to search for another product or try the Firewire product. I do not have experience with it, but after all the time I have spent attempting to get this drive to work reliably, I am sorry that I bought it. --- GOOD IDEA, BAD IMPLEMENTATION.Thanks"
2,Interesting but.....,"Since I am a huge Nero Wolfe fan, I wanted to read Stout's earlier series and I found it interesting, but...I can see why it didn't go over so well... I'll stick with the Wolfe series."
1,Oh Puh-lease!,It is like this book was written for a baby or something. Anybody looking for enlightened literature should look elsewhere.
5,A cute book! Lots of rhymes!,"This book is a cute book,and easy to read. Dr. Seuss always makes his book interesting and fun! The illistrations are cute and original! Great book if your looking for Rhymes."
5,One Fish Two Fish... a favorite,"All of my three boys (ages 1, 3, 5) love this book. I have to read it to them every single night, but by now they sometimes pretend to read it to me because they pretty much know all the words. It comes highly recommended by me!"
3,A very happy book,"Children are introduced to color words, rhyme, and visual and poetic surprises in a delightful book that remains memorable and refreshing. Dr. Suess makes a toy of words."
5,My favorite Dr Seuss book!,"Great illustrations, full of imagination, and witty rhymes, in the style of Dr Seuss. Children always love it, and adults do too sometimes."
3,mikey52791,One fish two fish red fish blue fish is a good book and it was funny to me i think all the readers of this book will enjoy it because of it is kinda like a learning book because it sort of helps you learn to count.
3,Mediocre Seuss,"I bought this based on memory instead of a quick re-read. I probably wouldn't have bought it, otherwise. The rhymes are OK, and there's a lot of silliness that seems like it is just in there to get things to rhyme. It doesn't really have a story. My daughter doesn't get engaged by it, and would rather flip through the pages to look at the pictures rather than actually read through it. Among the Seuss books, she prefers Sneetches and Yertle the most."
3,BANG YOUR (PIN) HEAD....,"The Ramones made a semi-metal album in ""Brain Drain,"" and it really didn't suit the band all that well. Dee Dee's bass is buried under thunder drums and slabbish guitars, distorting the bands' sound into something that would be considered (for 1989, anyway) more album radio friendly. You'll find a few good numbers here; the Dee Dee sung ""Punishment Fits The Crime,"" Joey's love sick ""Come Back Baby,"" and the anthemic ""Merry Christmas (I Don't Want To Fight Tonight)."" It just hurts that there are only two excellent songs here, ""I Believe In Miracles"" and the marvelous ""Pet Semetary"" (which long-time fan Stephen King requested for the film version of his book). Even the mandatory cover (""Palisades Park"") sounds out of synch. The ""Mondo Bizaro"" follow-up album would see the band return to their roots, but ""Brain Drain"" was just The Ramones trying too hard to sound current."
2,One of Their Worst,"While this album does have some decent tracks (Palisades Park, Merry Christmas) and contaons one of their best songs ever (Pet Sematary), on the whole, this is a forgettable album. This was the last album to feature Dee Dee, their original bassist, after he decided to switch from punk to rap. But this was really their worst album next to their previous release, ""Halfway To Sanity"". Save your cash."
4,Pet Semitary,"This is a great CD Classic Ramoans music Pet Semtary,Zero Zero UFO, Merry Christmas(I don't Want to Fight Tonight) and Palisades Park it is a great CD All Around"
3,Fun Read,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much asHawke: A Thriller. It is a roller coaster, page turner book for a long weekend or a sunny day on the beach. Don't expect great literature or admiration to the laws of physics (and sometimes common sense) but it is a fun read especially if you like James Bond movies, Bruce Wayne persona, and Sherlock Holmes character."
2,a real review,"I bought this book for help on a 12 hour flight, what a mistake. Totally improbable, filled with fluff, a waste of my time, and yours too. See my listing, you can buy it for $10"
3,Hawke is at it again,"I was so excited to read this book after my mother gave it an excellent reivew. However, I did not enjoy it as much as she did. I found the prior Alex Hawke books were far better than this one. It seemed to drag on forever, trying to make it exciting. An ok read, but not recommended"
1,"Implausible, Not Even Entertaining","There are too many technical omissions/errors to make this book readable to me. I get it that a ""thriller"" is over-the-top, but when I hit errors of this magnitude(flying a Gulfstream onto an aircraft carrier???), my reading comes to a screeching halt. I got about halfway through it, and just couldn't pick it back up. The characters are likable enough, but they're very one-dimensional and predictable. I'd rather re-read GOOD books than try to slog through this. I gave it one star because I had to in order to write a review."
4,Certainly Holds Your Interest,"A little slow out of the gate, but once this novel picks up pace it'll hold you rapt in the story. Very well thought out & written, Mr. Bell has done well here. Give it a go, it's certainly worth the read"
4,Link Wray R,This is one of the all-time GREAT live rock albums! Link handles vocals and smokes on guitar! Jimmy Lowell on bass and Anton Fig on drums are mighty in their own right. CD arrived in great condition.
4,The most perfect pointing device ever. Except...,"I think that Logitech really screwed the pooch when they dropped this design. It was FANTASTIC. It felt great in your hand and was incredibly accurate.The only issue with it was its lack of a scroll wheel. The USB version of this was great, but also lacked a scroll wheel. For most people, a cord on a trackball isn't a liability. The trackball doesn't need to move around, so the cord doesn't get in the way. Unfortunately, Logitech dropped this line in favor of the cordless ""Trackman Optical"". The TO is no slouch, I've been using one for years. (I have also bought quite a few for users in my company who had repetitive strain injuries from using mice) Still, the TO isn't nearly as elegant and pleasant to use as the FX.I suppose that there is just not enough market for trackballs for Logitech to continue making new products, but I'll keep watching and hoping that something this good comes back on the market."
3,It's Okay,"I would recommend ""On Writing Romance How to Craft a Novel that Sells"" by Leigh Michaels and ""Writing Romance Fiction For Love and Money"" by Helene Schellenberg Barnhart before I would recommend the Idiot's Guide. After reading those two, the Idiot's Guide was redundant and the style irritated me. Having said that though - I'm glad I bought it, if only because, somehow I got through the other two without fixing my signaling phrases. Because of the Idiot's Guide I was able to clean up my signaling phrases. The other two books are much better over all though."
1,Brilliant..as if.,"I realize it is an old movie and only like a few bucks, but if you can't sell a movie you can actually watch and have the nerve to list it in good condition, you need your head examined. I will never use this seller again. The movie had the stupid directors talking over the ENTIRE thing!"
3,Maple Leaf Political Thriller - Is that US? ;),"Our neighbors to the north present a fable, set in Canada, about taking control of water. It is a compelling mimic of what some of their thoughtful writers may have observed in the behavior of the United States government. It is a little melodramatic and thrilling in a dreadful way. I doubt that many of my compatriots will watch because it is very Canadian culturally. However, it is an interesting story depicting how fragile democracy and the truth are. Conspiracy theorists will really lap this up. The ending has a very interesting twist.I really like Paul Gross and try to watch his work whenever I can find it. This would make an interesting pairing with Milagro Beanfield War. For truly wonderful work by Paul Gross and other gifted Canadians, check out all of Slings and Arrows, a wonderful television series, 3 (Canadian/6 episodes) seasons-worth."
3,"Great recording quality, smooth voice, fun back-trip.","I'm a young dixieland banjo player currently immersing myself in the old-time jazz music. Mildred Bailey gives flawless execution and has a creamy voice with lyrics and music that takes you back to how it was then. Personally, compared with Bessie Smith and some others, Mildred can't touch them (but then nobody can). All and all, if you're into polished swing, this is good stuff."
4,A good book to introduce children to the joys of research.,"I think the best part of the book is that it shows children the fun and excitement of doing primate research in the wild. It shows why Alison Jolly hasreturned to the same piece of forest for the last30 years. It balances that by displaying some ofthe sorrowwhen you cannot help a dying animal.And of course, it describes Lemur catta social organizationat a level which should be entertaining to children,and mentions briefly some of the other lemurs foundin Berenty reserve.The book is nicely illustrated with photographs onevery page."
1,bland,"while i respect that this album may evoke emotions in other people, i have to state my opinion for the sake of people looking to buy this. i find this to be bland and boring: painfully annoying ""build ups"" that amount to nothing interesting. i have listened to it a good 15 times all the way through, usually at night when i am in the mood to appreciate subtle music. this just does not work for me. i am a big fan of instrumental music, so i was very surprised at how much i hated this cd. there are a million other bands that seem to be in a similar category as this, that i think are so much better: anything on touch and go records, my bloody valentine, mogwai, tortoise etc... maybe this is like my bloody valentine's loveless, you either get it or you dont. i do not 'get' what the attraction is to this music."
2,Warmed-over P. Floyd?,"Must confess to disappointment; this sounded like a record I would like. Well, they have a great name, and the artwork on the CD is really cool. However, the music itself, while tastefully done, is surprisingly unremarkable. Just because this type of thing has been done before doesn't mean that makes it bad. What makes it bad is that it has been done better and more compellingly before. Pink Floyd, Mercury Rev, and to a degree the Flaming Lips have created much finer ""orchestral"" soundscapes. The antisocial rantings that float through the music grow very tiresome with repeated listenings, and do little to inspire any feeling whatsoever. I appreciate the attempt to make a statement about millennial paranoia/angst, but would like more than one statement per record, you know? Not worth the money!"
2,Soulslinger doesn't sling too far,"This is more of an experimental drum&bass mix that soulslinger is known for.This is great for dj spooky fans.I only enjoyed one song.I remake of Biz Markie's ""Just a friends"" but still the mix is too bland."
1,bbbaaaddd,I think this cd is the worst I have ever heardthere is only a couple of songs i love but the rest are bad
5,JUST GREAT,"I really am pleased with my solar lights, they are the right color & everything & they seem to stay light longer."
4,The best bassgazm,The people have the idea of how to mix the music to create more music. I have to say that this CD is one hell of a CD to listen specialy if you love Bass.
4,how to help children with common problems,"If you work with children, this book is a good practical guide to assisting children and their families with many common problems. I found this book to be well written with many hepful suggestions and techniqes for dealing with a varity issues."
4,Dog food galore,"My daughter (7 years) loved playing with this pet shop with the animals, but not with Barbie. The fish bowl, dog wash station and critter cages are fun, but the dog food bucket is a disaster. I should have vacuumed up all the dog food from the start because that's what I've been doing ever since we got the set!"
3,Not everyone can read Layamon's English,"First of all, this is not a review of the poem (it's alright as far as Arthurian stories go); rather, it's a review of the edition. The biggest problem I had was a lack of a glossary in the back. For those who are unfamiliar with Middle English the original text becomes sort of an annoying visual aid or historical oddity as the translation dominates one's reading. I think it could have been made much better by original text side-glossed, with translations at the bottom of the page if needed. That would actually encourage people to learn Middle English as opposed to looking at it, thinking it looks pretty or quaint and then reading the translation.I also think a side-by-side printing of both manuscripts would have been helpful as well. I believe TEAMS makes an edition like this with the entire Brut but I'm not sure.Bottom line: pretty good edition, but it could be a bit better for both the serious student and the newcomer to Middle English."
5,Wonderful!,"My husband actually caught a glimpse of the first episode and after that was as hooked as I was. We watched it in three nights....and we are young busy parents. The story lines are cleverly entertwined and captivating in every way! It is a shame that we dont have more ""clean"" mini dramas over here!"
5,Love it....,One of the most entertaining films I have ever seen....I am hooked on English Movies.....and this one will be watched many times over.
3,"Decent, but no ""Downton Abbey""","A warning to all who love Downton Abbey: this does not compare in the least. Most of the story is based on three young ladies who attempt to hold the viewers' interest, but fail somewhat due to their characters' social limitations. A maid's life can only be so riveting. Also, be prepared to face extreme puzzlement and frustration when the series ends abruptly, leaving several plot points and characters' fates unresolved. Overall, this isn't a bad series; it's just not great either."
1,Ridiculous Plot: Needs Story Editor,"I expected to like this series as my wife and I are big fans of Upstairs/Downstairs, and The Duchess of Duke Street. Regretfully, and after a good start, the plot in the series becomes so painfully ridiculous that you just can't overlook it. The acting and sets are so-so, obviously due to a lack of budget, but what is especially annoying is the poor lighting. It looks like scenes were shot quickly with ""run and gun"" sun lamps, like the cheap-o American horror movies of the 1950s.I won't give away plot details, other than to say Hannah's remarkable action in the middle of the series is so implausible that any reasonable viewer will lose that ""suspension of disbelief"" that fiction relies on.Great idea, just poor executed, and mostly in need of a good story editor. The actors who played Ned, Ned's mother, and Nanny Collins were the few bright spots."
2,Are we to guess the ending of the story ???,"This is ridiculous. I watched this whole thing and then had to make assumptions as to the end of every storyline. What crazy person would put so much time and money into making such a series and not create an ending??? I wanted to know, good or bad, what happened to everybody. They intentionally built up to a climax in each storyline and then left it there. Why?? Good grief, I'm in total disbelief and sorry I wasted my time. Don't watch this, you will be completely disappointed."
4,High class production,"The acting is great, the story lines variable and exciting, and realistic for the time. I always enjoy good old fashioned shows."
3,"Good, but left hanging!","Bereft at the ending of Downton Abbey this season, I chose Berkeley Square to continue my obsession with British period drama. After a rather slow start, the story picks up and I was hooked. It definitely appeals to women more than men. My husband called it turn of the century Sex in the City (which he dislikes). My major complaint, as others have mentioned, is that the series finale leaves loose ends than beg for conclusion. I agree, it seems as though more episodes were planned. Not as spectacular as Downton Abbey, Berkley Square remains an entertaining and well-made series."
5,For lovers of British period drama,"One of the best series,since upstairs downstairs, pity there wasn't a second series as your left a bit up in the air at the end."
4,"Great, but leaves you hanging","I began watching this series and got completely engrossed immediately. The characters were quite believable and the stories were all woven together delightfully. However, we watched all 8.5 hours of the series only to be left completely hanging! There is no closure, and you are left to wonder what happens to all the characters. It's a shame that a sequel was never made, and if it was I would buy it immediately. At any rate, you should only invest the time in this if you have 8.5 hours to spare and you don't mind that you will never know how the stories end. If you like to finish stories in your head, this movie is for you."
4,Better as a sweet fix,"I like the sweetness better than the ""Spicy Mediterranean"". Amazed at the variance of crunch in each bite from tooth shattering that can be heard in the next room to air filled and light that nearly melts in your mouth, I prefer a lighter crunch with a little more consistency but the flavor is craveable."
4,Very cute,"These are really cute. VERY THIN. so not for cold weather. and they run big. My toddler has grown out of even 18 month clothes of some manufacturers and these are still big on him (18mos). So plan for not shrinking, and bigger than you think."
2,Bodysuits,"The packaging the bodysuits come in smells real strong of rubber but the smell does come out of the bodysuits once they are washed. The writing is very small to read, I would expected the lettering to be a bit larger and the sizing is a little off. The 12 month size compares to an 18 month size in comparable brands. Overall a fair product but I would not purchase again."
3,Research in Psychology,I needed this book for a Psychology course. Didn't use in very often except for assigned readings but found it very useful when I did need information. This book is organized very well as well as well written and easy to read. Each chapter starts out basic and develops from there in a clear and understandable course. Would recommend for any beginning researcher:]
3,Old formula worked better,"When they started making this phosphate free (like all detergents), it basically stopped working. Not Cascade's fault, but works poorly nonetheless. I add powdered phosphate to the dishwasher along with this for better cleaning."
4,Wonderful except ball falls out too easily,"I've used Logitech thumb trackballs since about 1999. As the other reviewers have said, it has saved my hand and arm from great pain. I own about 4 of the Trackman Marble Wheels (discontinued) and now one of these. Everything about it is perfect, EXCEPT that the ball pops right out of the top every time you drop it or even if it just gets turned over while moving (in a laptop case for example). I wish Logitech had made the ball just a little more snug or put a ring around it like on the old Trackman."
1,Not for the long haul...,"I bought this trackball after my Microsoft Explorer Mouse went bad about two months ago. My wife wanted to try a trackball and I had always been curious.I liked it at first but I found I had trouble clicking on buttons. When I would push the primary button I would almost always pull my thumb over at the same time and roll the cursor off the button.Then I started noticing the little 'hitches' in the ball movement--especially when moving to the left. Those hitches became more and more obvious, until it became almost a constant drag. Eventually, the ball became too difficult to move without strain.I ended up hating this mouse and now I love my new Microsoft Explorer Mouse.Add to that Logitech's almost non-existent support and you have my review."
3,Not as good as the older model,"It performs OK, but I also own an older version of the same model, and the new one has a much ""cheaper"" feel. The trackball does not move as smoothly in the socket on the new unit. There's more friction than in the old unit, and a bit of a rubbing sound. The new unit's plastic housing is lighter weight. The older unit had red lights on both sides of the trackball which lit when the mouse was operational; these are gone on the new one. I don't expect the new unit to last as long as the older one, which performed nicely for at least five years. It's disappointing."
5,Great Trackball Mouse,"I like this product and I believe it is helping the pain in my hand. I also purchased, for work, the cordless model. The trackball on the cordless model is stiffer and difficult to roll fast. I have two corded models and each has a ball that I can spin in a short stroke to reach the top of the screen. I had a trackball mouse many years ago and I am glad to have one again. I recommend this to anyone who has problems with their hand. I will have to purchase a gel pad to ease the pressure from the desk surface, but the mouse is great. I searched the internet and Amazon had the best price at the time of purchase."
2,Slippery track ball,I needed a mouse alternative. This item has a major flaw. The track ball is slippery and to light. I lack a lot of precision that I would get with track ball with a grip coating. I need to press hard on the ball to get it working and the motion is not fluid. I do not like this item.
2,So-So product,"I like the design and idea behind the mouse. Unfortunately, I feel like the track ball is a little too light as it's lacking a solid weight to keep a steady mouse pointer. I have noticed this with several people using it."
5,trackman,"I like the trackman vary much, I have a small work space and with the convenience of the ball I can operate without having to pickup and slid."
2,Right Button Dies Quickly,"I go through about 1 of these a month. The problem is, I play a game that I need to press the right mouse button down a lot of the time. If you look how this mouse is constructed, the only thing springing up the mice buttons from engaging is the memory of cheap plastic. After a month, there is no spring in the right button and my right button commands ""stick"". At $30 minimum, this is a horrible value for me. Yet it's the best trackball I can find. A tad more build quality and it would be great, now it's just frustrating."
4,"Excellent. But, doesn't last forever","I don't know how long a track ball like this is ""supposed"" to last. I bought this one as a replacement for one I've had for a few years. I use my track ball all day every day and have had just about every type of mouse or track ball there is. This is very reasonably priced, comfortable and performs great on my iMac. I also have the model that is a little less expensive on my PC.I bought the second Trackman because the scroll wheel on my original one had stopped working. While I was waiting for the second one to arrive, the first started working again. I'll hold onto the other one though because I'm sure I'll wear the second one out.... someday..."
3,Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical AVERAGE,"This is a very comfortable trackball to use once the human body becomes adjusted to moving the thumb instead of the mouse or middle wheel. It does not like to copy and paste easily, and occasionally has issues with keeping the cursor highlighting text.This could however, be a user malfunction. Decent product, the true test will come within a few months to see how it lasts with my constant use of it."
5,Best mouse EVER!,"I have been using this mouse from Logitech for years and surprised my sweetheart with one last year--I hate the traditional ones. I'm about to buy two more and surprise my boys who struggle with their traditional ones. It is SO COMFORTABLE and SO NATURAL to use! I never have any problems with it and have had it for years. My hand just doesn't feel right at a computer unless it's with this mouse! GET IT, you won't regret it!"
2,Good mouse BUT . . .,"I have bough serveral of these mice. The are good mice with accurate movement and everything one could ask for . .. except once extremely important problem: if the ball pops out of the socket, the slightest impact against another object produces a small scratch or dent in the ball. I ask you . . . even though a mouse is supposed to stay on a desk how many times does it fall to the floor buy accident. Well, with this mouse one time is enough to render it almost unusable.This small scratch or dent in the ball catches against the three plastic guides in the socket producing a small hitch to the movement to an incredibly annoying freeze of the ball moving anywhere.Small as this may sound, even one dent in the ball will catch dozens of times and hour if you move the ball a lot as in during game play or heavy editing of a text.Despite the advantages I love in this type of mouse I will never buy it again."
4,"Nice size, comfortable trackball","I really like this trackball. The size is nice and it is comfortable to use. The only thing I would like is more buttons, but that would most likely require a higher retail price.If you are looking for a good three button trackball with a wheel your money is well spent on this product."
5,mighty mouse,This is a great mouse but it takes a little getting used to. It works great if you have a laptop because you doon't have to move the base. You can use it on the bed or on your knee. I like it better than the cordless because of no battery to replace. If you don't mind the battery the cordless is better. I have bought three trackball mice.
2,thumb action is awkward,"I love trackballs, and tried this one because my hand fit it well. But I found that I cannot get used to having the trackball under my thumb -- it's excruciatingly awkward. Obviously YMMV -- many reviewers here like it.Plus having used Kensington trackballs for a long time, I find that this ball is too small and does not roll as smoothly as I'm accustomed to. Unfortunately Kensington's current main model has other problems, which I've reviewed there. And the new Logitech which has the ball in the right place only comes cordless, which I'd rather not have to deal with.Edward-- I see the brevity of truth. --"
3,Trackball,"Well made. Takes time to get used too! A comfortable break from a mouse!Good for browsing, but I cannot recommend it for gaming."
4,A Painless upgrade,Great product that eases the pain you get from dragging your wrist around the top of your desk or wrist pad using a conventional mouse.The only drawback is that Logitech's version doesn't have the addition buttons like Microsoft's trackball that can be used for webpage back/forward navigation. This one is simply a 3 button plus scroll wheel model.
2,"Trackball a good, but not thumb trackballs","I've been using trackballs for decades now, but this was my first thumb activated trackball. I suppose they are fine if that's what you are used to, but I hated it. It just took too much effort to move the pointer across the screen. Not to mention that with a normal trackball I have three fingers I can use to move the trackball instead of just a thumb."
3,Why No Back-up Button?,"I purchased this product because it has a scroll wheel. My previous mouse had no such wheel, but it did have a button to go back to the previous page. This one doesn't. To be complete, it needs one both on the single click area and the double click area."
5,2 years and still love it!!,I have had mine for two years. Not a single problem to date. Easy to clean and a blast to use. Never again run your hand all over your desk or have to pick up your mouse cause your running out of room. Roll the ball with your thumb and click with your fingers. I love this thing!!!!
1,Do not buy 2007.,"I have been a Quicken user from their start. This 2007 program crashes (screen locks) most times you use it and you must use the emergency shut down (even Task Manager won't work) and do a new cold boot. They can not establish a download with my bank, and say the problem is on their end and their ""team"" is ""working on it"". The password vault dialog box often is absent. There are many other problems. If you call for help you get some one in India who speaks Indian and not American English, and quite faintly. If the problem is technical they just hang up on you. This program is unfinished. Wait until next year, then buy 2007, if you must. Perhaps they will have fixed it by then."
2,Not Well Organized,"Hard to follow, especially if you're a beginner. I'd recommendAcupressure's Potent Points: a Guide to Self-Care for Common Ailmentsis so much easier to use, so helpful.Also needs more editing (typos, etc).This intrigued me because it said using chopsticks, but it's just accupressure, you can use your fingers/chopsticks/whatever can reach that pressure point."
3,Vintage Felix,"Great animation is hard to come by these days, which makes this DVD collection of Felix the Cat cartoons worth having. However, one wishes the DVD had been longer than 51 minutes. Surely the producers could have thrown in a few additional cartoons or some supplementary material. As a result, the DVD leaves you wanting more gems such as ""Felix in Hollywood"" (1923) and ""Felix Woos Whoopee"" (1930). The print quality is quite good and the disc includes some color footage of animation pioneer Otto Messmer - the genius behind the cat."
3,Not what you may expect,"Like you probably are, I expected to see the Felix the Cat that I grew up with here, running around with his magic bag of tricks. That's not what this DVD is about exactly.These are some of the original Felix the Cat cartoons. Way before the character we all immediately recognize as Felix was developed. These are silent cartoons (just a soundtrack played in the background with the occasional screen-sized caption for dialogue or plot). The art is fairly basic, but the animation is still all right.That's not to say that this DVD is not etertaining. It can be quite funny, and it's really interesting to see this very early stage of Felix's evolution. For collector's and die-hard Felix fans, it's a must. But for the majority of us who just remember an old friend that we love it's something of a disappointment."
5,Great quality,"Great quality cable. Great sheathing, and very good length. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good length quality cable."
3,Link failed,"I went ahead and got the link along with the cassette tapes and cleaning tape, all together. The cable didn't fit my camera, as I had hoped. So, if you own a JVC miniDV camera, just a warning it probably won't work. Otherwise, seems like a good cable, I don't mind keeping it for other uses."
5,"Good quality, good price",I use this cable to upload video from my camcorder to my computer. It seems to be very fast and the price was very good.
3,"An incredible collection, but why no TOC?","This is the finest collection of Benedetti stories available, so as a collection this gets 5 stars. I'm detracting 2 stars simply because there is no TOC, meaning that to get to a particular story you have to leaf trough the entire volume. A very poor showing Alfaguara and I hope this doesn't extend to all future kindle editions."
5,One of the best adaptations of early Christiandom.,"Kirk Mitchell presented an inspirational look at early Roman/Jewish relations. The characters were filled with personality; the details presented about the era were spectacular. The plot was woven with such care that the novel reads like an authoritative treatise that explains early Jewish, Roman, and Christian life. It is as inspirational as it is informative.The novel was outstanding!"
3,"Good book, but wrong edition!","This is a VERY good ""beyond the basics"" guide to OneNote 2003.The only problem is ... that I have OneNote 2007. Now, I'll be the first to say that all of the philosophy and many of the commands cross right over, but there is enough of a difference to make you scratch your head.However, when I bought this book, I also bought this reference card:Microsoft OneNote 2007 Quick Reference Card - Handy Durable Tri-Fold MS One Note 2007 Tip & Tricks Guide. 6 Total Pages. Stores Easily. Ultimate Reference for Shortcuts, Tips & Cheats for Microsoft OneNote 2007 Note Taking & Management Software. (Softwa...and between the two, have been rapidly learning OneNote.Oh, and as far as I can tell (March 2009), there are no books on OneNote 2007 on the market, so the above approach may be your best bet!"
4,Gorgeous in places,"'Star Sail' is great: starting off with dreamy chorals and near-whispered opening lines... then in with the cascading power guitars... thundering bass clipping like the audio on a Saturn V rocket launch... the murmered lyrics melting into the guitar feedback until the whole song is about to collapse, then... a magnificent resolve. It's amazing. 'Slide Away' and 'The Sun, The Sea' are very strong.Some reviewers object to the 'wall of sound' and atmospherics of this album, while others seem to object to the fact that it's not 'like' Urban Hymns. I think this album has the same place in The Verve's and Richard Ashcroft's solo catalogs that Unforgettable Fire does in U2's: yeah, there's a lot of effects going on, in in many songs the lead singer's voice is held behind the instruments, but at its best still contains some gorgeous songs and moments."
2,Very disappointing.,"This album could have been a good one if it weren't for two things. Number one, the sound quality of A Storm In Heaven is just plain horrible. Ashcroft's vocals are just about nonexistant, as McCabe's guitars steal all of the glory throughout nearly the entire recording. Even some of the guitar work in this album is atrocious. As one reviewer said, parts of this album sound like a 'bad bootleg'. Another reason why ASIH gets two stars is because of the poor songwriting by Ashcroft. Before I bought this album I was expecting to hear thought-provoking, heartfelt lyrics and some decent guitar work. Well, the guitars deliver somewhat, but there were no lyrics that brought out any emotions whatsoever. ""I must be feeling alone...I talked to God in a phonebox on my way home. I told you my answer...I left you my dreams on your answering machine."" These are the kind of lyrics that you'll find on Urban Hymns(check out A Northern Soul too). Giving this album two stars is very generous."
4,Good Information for parents of Brain-Injured children,"This book provides a good history of how brain-injured children have been treated in the past 50 years and what has been done to improve their chances of recovery. I read this book in order to try to help my brain-injured son who is recovering from meningitis. While this book gives a lot of good insight into how the injuries are treated, it does not give me any information I can personally use for my son. A more appropriate title might be ""What Can Be Done For Brain-Injured Children"". Dr. Doman's Institutes has a 1 week course for parents with the same title as the book which is a pre-requisite. I would recommend this book to a parent of a brain-injured child, but I would also tell them not to expect an answer to be found here. I will continue my search for help for my son and hope all parents of such children find help as well"
5,Great Book,"This is a great book if you have a brain injured child, it really puts things into perspective that there really is hope for your child even if doctors say that it is hopeless. As parents we always believe for the better don't let doctors discourage you as children are very resilient and you will never know the outcome unless you work it through and try."
1,Shipped in a plastic bag,"And it arrived at my niece's punctured and distorted. Surely something intended for a baby should be better protected! As my niece is 8 months pregnant and it's hot, I told her to toss it, rather than go through the aggro of returning. So I'm out the full amount."
2,best part in opening credits,"I have 2 say i was highly disappointed. the box cover had the best picture in the whole film. when the movie was going through the opening credits, i thought it was going 2 b pretty interesting. now mind u, i didn't buy this film 4 dialogue nor did u but when the credits were over, all it was was some ok looking girls coming over 4 some kissing & some rubbing. the best looking lady was the vampiress & she was just a 7 on a scale of 10. so 2 conclude this review, after the first 5 minutes, do yourself a favor & eject the movie to keep a good taste in your mouth"
2,No NDIS2 protocol available,"Ok unit but is not a ""real"" Xircom; no support for DOS or ghost drivers. Good choice for the basics but not a business class unit. I'm returning it and buying a Realport Unit."
4,Thinking about...,"There's music that fulfill the ears with confort, and there's music that open up your mind to something new. I think that the last one only the real artists do. Challenge themselves and their public to the new. That's for sure something not commercial and a risk that few people take. That's why I thanks to Brian Eno, Robert Fripp and now Reeves Gabrels. Your worlds created with music make ours much more interesting. Thank you. P.S.: That's what I think about the album. A challenge. And a good one."
5,Outstanding modem!,"I just received this modem, and it is the fastest external modem I have ever had. It does not support Windows 2000 or WindowsXP (yet, drivers are being written now). I bought it to use with Linux and Linux loves it. This modem is well worth the money!"
5,I See Its Faster,"I Based on 4 review of this modem, 2bad and 2god review's i thinking on buy this modem but i'm not convenced to buy.Is the same thing Modem Blaster V.92 Serial of Creative Labs Modem Blaster Flash 56II External Modem?"
2,I'm not sure what to make of this book,I didn't particularly like this book. I found it difficult to find something when I needed something specific. It was not easy to follow at the best of times. It's not my favorite.
3,It's a stretch to tie this all together.,"A body found in a bricked up fireplace after twenty years, a murdered candidate for Scottish parliament, and a suicide with a big secret and it all ties together? Well, it's a bit of a stretch in this one. Renkin works hard and it shows. This is a disparate lot of puzzles, and it is really reaching to work them together. Without the deus ex machina in the form of Rebus's favorite foe, Big Ger it wouldn't really happen at all. It is this occasional dependence on the Scottish crime lord that often works against the series, sometimes it seems an easy way out when Rebus needs something done, either directly or indirectly, and in pops Cafferty. This is a solid outing, but too many characters pop in and out without real purpose making the novel probably 100 pages more than it needs to be."
4,A good read for a cloudy cold day,Ian Rankin writes a good book which will keep you interested without giving away too much. He also keeps one interested in the characters and how they react with one another. I would recommend this as one of the better mystery novels that I have read.
5,A religious experience!,"Listening to Horowitz my whole life, this recording is out of this world! To think Horowitz was days before death when he recorded this makes you wonder if he was indeed human! The musical smoothness and nuances of bringing out inner notes is a joy to listen to. The Haydn is amazing and each Chopin proves to be a new, fresh experience. The Liszt is remarkable from start to finish. There's something about hearing the ""Liebestod"" (brilliantly played!) and knowing it was Horowitz's final recording and he poetically would die shortly thereafter. The inner response you'll feel upon hearing each piece is a religious experience! I listen to this CD over and over!"
5,A required addition for your business library.,"Diana and Kelly's book on Virtual Assisting is one of leading books in the VA Industry. I purchased this book because it was so highly recommended by other VAs. If colleges were using it as their textbook it was a definite purchase for me. I found it to be a tremendous help in marketing, pricing, and just general ""how to"" tips. I couldn't put it down. Any VA serious about their business needs to have it in their reference library."
