4,does the job,I used to go nuts putting things in the way of whatever I didn't want my dirtdog to get at or go into. I bought two of these so I could square off sections in rooms where I know it has trouble. The only reason for the four stars is that the signal kind of fans out the further away from it you go. That means you can't really get a straight line before the iRobot device starts to tweak out... other than that I tought it was a good price for what it did.
2,Blatant errors and haphazard construction,"In addition to other comments on the dryness and counterintuitive organization of this book, I must point out that it is poorly edited as well. Many of the blatant typographical errors appear in the first couple chapters, but they continue throughout. Multiple times I have found a quote that doesn't make sense and, upon looking up the source material, discovered that it was improperly transcribed (i.e. ""diverse"" becomes ""divers""; ""estopped"" becomes ""estoppel""; ""an"" becomes ""and""). As a first-year student deciphering dense material, the last thing you need is to second guess the accuracy of the information you receive from your textbooks. I won't give the book 1 star because I've read no other Contracts casebooks for comparison, but I can give an inaccurate, poorly edited text no more than two."
3,SimpleTech STI-MMC Card,It's not as good as I thought! I have to wait for almost a minute before I can take another picture.
1,Awful,"Don't waste your money, much less your time. Awful, awful, awful. About half-way through you get the impression that everyone just gave up."
1,Awful,"Jackie Chan is funny but all his movies are the same. Plus, they get worse every year. This one takes the cake-I can't remember last time i was this bored. This is his worst movie to date. May be he should retire."
1,Worst Chan Movie Ever,"I haven't seen every Jackie Chan movie, but I've seen many of them and this is the worst. I've never walked out of a film before, not even considered it, but opening night I was there to support Jackie, and half-way in I nearly got up and left. Bad, really, really bad."
2,Amazon has the wrong spec. again,"The movie is not that great which most people alredy knew. However, the extrme lack of efforts with this Blu-ray is shocking. Amazon has the wrong spec. about audio; the disc actually only has PCM stereo (2.0)!!!!! It's not even as good as the DVD which has multiple 5.1 language tracks. Buyers be aware."
5,Jakie Chan At His Best,"'The Medallion' captures all of the qualities fans of Jakie Chan know and love, action, supspense, extreme humor, and a touch of mystisism, all the qualities I know and loved in the KID'S WB! 'Jakie Chan: Adventures' cartoon series. It has a great cast [Julian Sands as the dreaded Snakehead, Claire Forlani as the high kicking Interpol Agent Nicole, Lee Evens as the bumbling Agent Watson, and, of course, Jakie Chan as the Chinese Super-Man Eddie Yang] that help give the movie a great energy. The greatest thing about it was it wasn't afraid to make fun of itself! Great movie, I hope they make a sequel!"
2,A Harsh Mondern-day Romeo & Juliet,"Definite change in London's usual roles, with his characters' skewed view of love. I found the concept interesting, and it had it's spots of humor, but the best thing about it was a song called ""Timebomb"" by Flesh, which I cannot seem to find ANYWHERE. A ""B"" movie at best, I still can't stop myself from watching it."
1,Seller makes empty promises,"I ordered this product, to be delivered to my friend's P. O. Box, in August 2011. It did not arrive, so I checked order tracking and learned that the shipper claimed to have left it AT THE FRONT DOOR(!). Front door of what, the post office? I posted a comment stating the above.I contacted the seller. They were quite apologetic, and said if I would remove the negative comment they would reship the product. I removed the negative comment. That was 8 months ago. Guess what? No replacement product.This seller is unfamiliar with the success formula: underpromise and overdeliver. They don't even deliver what they promise, and then they seduce you into removing negative comments with more promises, also empty.Before you buy from them, ask them to explain this transaction."
1,Too Much. Way Too Much.,"This would be a great album if they stuck to the 12 best songs (White Rabbit, Somebody, etc.). Instead, we get two cds chock full of rubbish. Face it, this band's post-1970 recordings were irrelevant (if you don't think so, just listen to We Built This City). Save your money! Get Volunteers and Bless It's Pointed Little Head."
2,2.5 Stars,"Sorry I don't believe in rounding up for the ""offical"" rating. Anyway, there are LOTS of good songs here, but unfortunately, there are LOTS of bad songs as well... probably about 2/3 of the songs aren't too great, but the ones that are good more than make up for the bad songs! The good songs are GREAT!"
4,Pricey but works well.,"I like this so much I have one at home, and another at work. But there are cheaper alternatives."
4,Louis,Enjoyable L'Amour adventure of the Sacketts. Not as good as many of his books but definitely worth reading this one
4,It's pretty nice.,"Very soft and comfortable. Pretty nice in the colder weather (well, 40 degrees), but a little warm for my taste in the summer time.The wife loves it, so I'll have to go with that sentiment.Oh yeah, I also got it at a great price (~100$)."
5,The Authorative Work On The Land Wars,"Unlike the previous reviewer whose academic qualifications are unknown, James Bellich is a well-known historian in this country. Whenever anyone in this country attempts to portray the truth about a shameful episode in this country, they are met with howls of protest and outright lies. History has always been taught here from the perspective of the so-called winners, very few Non-Maori know the true facts and sadly even less care. Anyone who wants to read the truth should read this book."
5,"well, received, thank you.",as if the arthor was writing it.enjoy your hoildays. perhaps a better new year and good fortune to all. wow
2,The quality is poor and not made in Germany,I received the package and I'm very disappointed with the items i received. None of them are made in Germany and the quality is poor. I owned a few sets of Villeroy & Boch and these are just not up to the standard!
3,Good episodes,"7th in the series, Capt. Drinkwater's action takes place in the Baltic as Napoleon rolls up the Russians in 1807. Ostensibly carrying gold to the British ally, the Tsar, Drinkwater's cruise is episodic and nearly aimless at first, but concludes with an exciting rush under the eye of an ancient nemesis and the guns of the French. I get less of a sense of adventure and curiosity than with O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, whereas the larger political context of alliance building against Napoleon is clearer here. However, the shipboard world of H.M.S Antigone thereby becomes less central and important. Except for some pro forma sail handling, unfamiliar terms are rare, even the regular cursing. This Sheridan House book has lesser art, better paper, and double the price of Warner's series."
3,Excessively Lonnnnng!,"While the movie was okay. I thought that it could have been 45 minutes to an hour shorter. It just seems to me that they dragged the conclusion out too long. I have to wonder whatever possessed anyone to make a movie about a murderer who was never caught anyway... I mean, there is only so much ""meat"" you can put into such a movie to make it interesting. To be honest, I really didn't like it, but it was okay."
4,zodiac,"movie was good but i wish there would have been some extras, like info on the real zodiac killer"
5,Great DVD.... Finally!,"I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the lore of the Zodiac. As a person highly interested in the history of this highly publicized unsolved case it was painful to suffer through the weak attempts over the past few years t make a true zodiac movie. The movie was great on all levels, I had to watch it again and again. Naturally, when this 2-disc set came out I had to get it also because it has interviews with people that knew the primary suspect as well as the victims. Spoiler alter coming... One interview in particular struck me as very strange. I am sure that many people that picked this DVD up are wondering... since Leigh Allen's DNA did not match the Zodiac's... is this guy they are interviewing on this DVD (an acquaintance of Leigh) is actually the Zodiac.. a free man walking the streets today"
2,WARNING! Future Double Dip,"This is a fantastic movie, but I thought it'd be useful to post this information for those who didn't know. If you enjoy this film, just like Fincher's other movies (""Fight Club"", ""Se7en""), there is going to be a Special Edition release of this DVD. In 2008 there will be a release with multiple commentary tracks and loads of extras. This release here is the ""bare bones"" version. If that's all you need, then fine. But for those who don't want to get ripped-off buying the same thing twice; it's probably worth waiting for the 2008 disc. I hope this helps."
4,Zodiac,"'Zodiac' is a good film that kept me interested for the whole duration, but with a slightly lack lustre ending. I know this is based on real events so the director was unable to spice the ending up too much, but I found the way it fizzled out and wrapped up the story with a few screens worth of writing at the end pretty poor pay off for well over 2 1/2 hours viewing. Saying that, this film is very atmospheric. It is excellently directed and the various actors do a top job in building suspense and keeping you hooked into the story. Some murder scenes early on are quite shocking and powerful without being excessively gratuitous, which is something in itself. Overall this is a good film, that should keep you watching, but don't expect too many plot twists or a shock ending to leave you with that feeling of satisfaction. A solid four stars.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,"Awesome recreation, Great Story, Scary!!!","I saw this movie once and it scared me. I don't scare easily. Excellent job by Robert Downey Jr.! Just a bit long, but for the price worth owning.Leaves you asking ""Was He The Zodiac?"""
3,Okay book,"I thought this book was just okay. Really didn't have any additional information that you can't find by simply searching on the internet. Didn't have any ""lightbulb"" moments while reading."
5,Cool Vamp movie!,"I'd seen this film a few years ago and put it on my ""to buy"" list. Took a while, but I finally found it and glad that I did!"
3,Future of Humans depends on Vampires!,"An ambitious and well-produced film from New Zealand, this film is set in an alternate history where vampires and humans peacefully co-exist. Vampires are used to save humans from disease and humans volunteer their blood to sustain vampires.The vampires also hold a role like that of priests.Oddly too, all are male.All is well until one is born who wishes to feed directly from humans in the more 'traditional' vampiric-film waySaffron Burrows plays a cop sent to track this way-ward vampire down, along with the help of a vampire played by Dougray Scott. It's kept a state secret that there's a rogue vampire - the public can't know that there's an imbalance in their societyAlthough I thought great attention was paid to production values I was not impressed by the plot.The rogue vampire seeks to spread disease which turns people into zombies akin to Dawn of the Dead - where they go on a rampage. This for me was too strange!"
2,"Don,t buy","I got this CD for free from Pepsi points. If I had spend money on it I would be really upset. If you a fan on vampire movies very disappointing. Reminded me on a bad version of Blade and Resident Evil in the 1800 Century. Don't waste your money if you really whant to see it, rent it."
1,INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY CLEP STUDY GUIDE,THIS STUDY GUIDE IS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. LACKING ESSENTIAL INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION. IT WOULD MORE ACCURATELY BE CATEGORIZED AS A GUIDE TO STUDY LINKS ON THE INTERNET. THE REASON ONE BUYS A BOOK IS TO SAVE TIME AND HAVE INFORMATION ORGANIZED IN A CONSISE FASHION TO PREPARE FOR AN EXAMINATION. THIS GUIDE PROVIDES NEITHER.
3,Well made & great looking shoe but with one problem...........,"the sandal is not true to size, it's actually one whole size off. Also beware that they don't offer 1/2 sizes. As an example I ordered my usual size 8 but needed the 9. Other than this major fault, these sandal are made of high quality materials and looked and felt expensive.Another great thing I noticed that Dezario shoes are made in the U.S., which is very rare these day."
5,Aiptek Charger for digital camcorder,"I wasn't sure this was the right charger for my daughter's digital camera/camcorder, but it apparently fits numerous camera brands, and it worked beautifully with ours. The box contained not just a wall charger but several other items including a little tripod; there were also directions in the box, and they were so easy to understand that we had her camera charged and on the tripod almost immediately. Good product and it was a nice surprise to get extras along with the charger."
2,disorganized mess,"While the author has a huge amount of knowledge on the subject matter he clearly has no idea how to create a textbook that flow seemlessly from one topic to the next. I spent all semester jumping back and forth between subjects and topics. The case studies are dull and dry, and for the most part outdated."
3,Good if You Can Suffer Through,"Just finished a class taught from this book and I did NOT love trying to learn from it! Ettlie knows TONS but can't seem to organize his thoughts or stay on topic! Clue: he does repeat the same thoughts throughout the book so occasionally you can use later passages to decipher others. He even has two sections by the same name in one chapter - I am not kidding! I don't even think his editor could make it through this one. Lots of great ideas in there but plan many hours reading every single reference to try to figure out his points. That is IF you can find the references, some are quite old and many are flat WRONG, or not completely identified, especially in Chapter 9. Sadly, his reviews as a prof sound about the same. Smart guy but proceed with caution!"
3,This movie is 2 different things.,"This is a very bad movie with bad special effects, dumb storyline, fake gun noises, and no comedy. However, Jackie Chan has a small role and the scenes he's in are great. He is a great fighter in this one and has a funny dubbed voice that's squeaky."
1,No No NO!,"Sluggish, embarassing martial arts weakly hold this film in one piece. Totally rediculous. Chan himself states that the only reason he did this film was because he owed a friend a favor."
2,One of the most garbled plots ever,"It is really hard to describe this film.The movie starts out with a group of generals (one of them named ""Abraham Lincoln"") in Civil War era army outfits in the middle of Canada being attacked by the Chinese sometime around World War II.It goes downhill from there.The plot is a bunch of unrelated scenes held together by the pretense of rescuing the generals from the Chinese. (And barely at that.) It is as if someone had grabbed scenes from a bunch of different films at random and filmed them. (Which may actually be true, from what I have read about the film.)Jackie Chan is in the beginning and end of the film. The rest is left up to a cast of relative unknowns.The DVD is not the greatest quality. It is a pretty cheesy movie. You are not going to make much sense out of it, but it is fun to show to your friends just for the confused looks on their faces."
5,Nice Festive Lights for Summertime Fun,Bought these Lights for Use on My Deck and Patio all Year round. They are Nice and Bright using Very Little electricity. Happy I was able to Get them while the Buy 3 Get 1 FREE Promotion was On. Seems to be decent quality product for a Very Low Price. Would Buy again.
5,Great book for beginners,"This is a great book for beginners. Kellogg does an excellent job explaining the basics of Authorware. I had no trouble taking what I learned in the book and applying it in my own Authorware projects. What this book doesn't cover are some of the other Authorware issues...like programming Authorware or using Authorware 5's new ""Knowledge Objects"". However, you will easily learn the basics of Authorware using this book. It's a very good place to start."
2,Repeats most of previous Authorware 4 materials,"For a basic instruction in Authorware 5 Attain, this book will take you through the basics. One great disappointment is that one of the most important new features in Authorware 5 Attain, Knowledge Objects is not covered! This will be a great disappointment for those who need to know how this exciting new feature works."
2,Buy this book only if you have the full software available.,"While the text provides an excellent introductory tutorial to Authorware, the 45 day time limit on the included CDROM is a very serious flaw in many settings. My graduate class is not even half over, and students can no longer practice their assignments at home. They must come into the campus labs unprepared.The earlier edition of the text included an Authorware working model that had some file saving limitations, but it did not have a time limit. It is now a highly valued collector's item on this campus!"
3,"Good, but not the best!",This CD is fun but these are old recordings so the sound quality isn't super. I recommend the Die Grossen Erfolge [IMPORT] Marlene Dietrich for the real music lover that wants the most from Marlene more.
1,Poor Quality and very unstably,"what's the point of having a color web cam when the quality is aslmost as black and white, and besides that make sure to hold on to the camera (unless you glue it to ur laptop) it's not stable ."
1,Not durable,I've had two ... eventually ... about 1.5 years each ... they start fritzing out. When they work they are excellent. Not sure why the one reviewer had problem attaching to the laptop ... seems to work fine for me. However ... I gave it a low rating ... too expensive ... not durable. A year and a half life span is good for a $50 camera but not for this one. Better webcams for the same price or lower. Not to mention Sony Customer Service is not what it use to be. Sad but true.
4,Superman The Movie,Always a lot of fun to watch this movie. My kids were comparing it to the events throughout the seasons of Smallville.
5,Watched it for the first time as an adult and loved it,"I was a kid the last time I saw Superman. I'm in my 30s now and just watched it again and I loved it. I got chills several times throughout the movie, like when Christopher Reeve changes into Superman for the first time and saves Lois Lane falling from the helicopter. The famous Superman music starts playing and you get goosebumps. The entire backstory is told in this movie which is really nice, unlike the superhero movies of today. The special effects are actually pretty good for their time. I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Christopher Reeve was great and will always be the best Superman - tall, handsome, strong - it's such a tragedy what happened to him in real life. Can't wait to watch part II. Highly recommend!"
5,Superman Lives,"I have seen Superman in all of its wonderful incarnations going back to the 1950's television series starring George Reeves, who for most of us back then, was the man of steel, until the year 1978. I was in high school then, but could not wait to see Superman transformed onto the ""Big Screen."" I later toured Universal Studios to see how they made Superman fly - an amazing effect back then using a flat table, a wind machine and some carefully and strategic flying footage along with blue screen effect. A great film to see again and again...for which to date, I have seen at least a dozen times but never tire of seeing Christopher Reeves as the great man of steel, representing all that's good in man and mankind alike."
5,I Believe I Can Fly,One of the best superhero movies. Well done SFX for its time. Best parts of the story are the human elements. Hackman's Luthor is the weak point. More of a clown than a menace. John Byrne watched this dozens of times before he took over the comic book. This should be required watching for anyone who wishes to write or draw Superman. Christopher Reeve does a spectucular job here without making the Man Of Steel into too much of a Cub Scout.
2,"Was great in it's time,but now is just a curiosity.","I realize that what i'm about to say is going to be considered sacreligious to all you S-Man fans,but DVD does nothing to hide the fact that ""Superman the Movie"",and the rest of the series have not aged well.I loved them when i was young,but now,even with the enhanced sound,and fairly decent DVD transfer,there is nothing appealing about the man in tights.I tried to enjoy it with the same youthful wonderment i did as a child,but i soon realized there's times when you can't go back.I did'nt even finish watching it,that's how boring and outdated everything felt.If you are a fan,you probably pre-ordered the original,or the collection the day it was announced,but i would caution the undecided to maybe rent them first,to see if the magic is still there.You'll be glad you did."
1,The Un Special edition,Was this released as a joke? Despite being called the special edition this is the cut one. Theres a lot of missing scenes. The deleted scenes section only includes 2 extra and I can think of at least 4 other missing scenes not included in this dvd.I guess my definition of Special edition must be different to everyone else's.Very disappointed with it.
1,Very Disappointing,"The sound quality is worse than an old, scratched vinyl record. Music is boring and old. Extremely disappointing."
1,An Ego Trip in Screenplay Form,This book is uninspiring and simplistic and the paper it's printed on is already yellowing so even the publisher must know it isn't a classic meant to least the Ages. Lew Hunter's screenplay example is hardly a masterpiece to imitate. Stick with Syd Field since he's just as basic without the bravado.
2,To much to read NO information,Lews book was not helpful in the fact that it did not offer any such information on how to write the screenplay. INSTEAD he concentrated on charecter development and night and day senerios. Most of us know how to tell a story. We just want the information and facts to help us delever our thoughts in the screenplay format.
3,Wicker,"A product with these dimensions was very difficult to find. I needed something like this to go between my washer and dryer. In general, it is what I expected and I am glad I bought it. However, I would prefer to have real wicker, not plastic. The drawers do not slide well but I was more interested in using it as a spacer to fill a gap between the washer and dryer than I was the storage space. This is a unique item that could become a great product if a company would produce a higher-end item using better quality materials."
3,Broken Power Button Too!,"Mine broke just after the 12 month warranty expired, go figure. I barely every pressed the thing, and poof, inside the monitor it went. Aside from that, the monitor has worked well. It is extremely annoying to not be able to power down the monitor now.I can't believe HP is still selling this unit though with such an obvious and crippling defect. They should at least be offering free repairs in the same spirit of auto recalls. We all take the gamble on the screen lasting, but a part that will be used every day should last the life of the unit."
2,No Good,"I was really looking forward to a large screen. However when this arrived I was disapointed. When the picture filled the screen it looked way to streched and out of proportion. By the time I had a good picture I could have easily had a much smaller screen. The sound from the speakers is terrible and it will not be long before I buy addition speakers for it.Dont consider this item, its just not good enough"
4,Great for new mums,"Great for new mums, motivating and lots of progression so you can use it for a long time. Mix and match work outs so make it longer or shorter whatever suits you that day"
1,Never received the product,My vendor never sent it to me so I have no idea whether the cd is good or not :(
3,Sounds alike,"Soothing and mellow, but no changes in rhythms or style. If you're in THIS mood, it's fine, but my other Debbie Friedman CDs would be my first choices ahead of this one."
3,use only for small fish,the reel was ok if you are fishing for guppies. all 3 of my kids had a hard time reeling in the fish they had caught and the little fish they did catch didn't put up much of a fight but it was a good starter reel.
4,good filter,I use this machine in my basement which always had a faint musty odor. This totally gets rid of the odor and lasts for 2 years
1,Dd not receive,I paid for this product and then I did not even receive the product. Do not go through this company. You may not receive your product and then you are out money.
2,Released against Jackie's will,"Yes, our buddy Jackie Chan left production halfway through the movie. If you look at the last fight, it uses the exact same shots that were used in the first Fearless Hyena movie. They simply took that fight and ""carefully"" spliced it into this movie. I was quite disappointed. Oh well."
2,"Not ""Like New"" condition","I ordered a very rare DVD so I'm not completely shocked it was not in ""like new"" condition and if it isn't fine but don't list it higher just to make a sale. The disc showed up in a CD jewel case instead of a DVD case which isn't a big deal just not what I expected when ordering, but the worst part was the disc hadn't even been cleaned before shipment so there were fingerprints all over both sides of the disc. These were easily cleaned off with Windex but that shouldn't have been my problem."
5,Not the usual Jackie.....,"while I agree with the previous reviewer that fearless hyena is also excellent, this is also a top-notch kung fu film, and defintely not ""painful"". maybe he saw ""snake fist fighter"" and got the two mixed up. fans of Jackie's kung-fu comedy style may not like this as much as some others, this is a classic formula kung fu film. the super-secret kung fu style contained in a much coveted book, the powerful villain with stereotypically dressed henchmen, bad dubbing...it's all here. one of the few Chan movies where he's an extremely skilled fighter from the start of the film, and a wisecracking one to boot. however, one of the female co-stars must be related to the producer...by the time she dies you'll be cheering the villain. this movie also received a few votes in a ""best Jackie movie ever"" poll of the jackie chan fan club mailing list."
2,ORIGINAL VERSION IS ALWAYS BETTER~!!!,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
2,Intersting premise falls flat,"I received this as a gift many years ago. After recently reading several U.S. histories and several founding-father biographies I pulled this out for some lite reading. While an interesting read, my copy is going in the trash.Most of my thoughts have been expressed by other reviewers. True to the title the book is mostly a fast-paced debunking of one ""myth"" after another, many of which are generally accepted as myth or are inconsequential to american history. The work is footnoted (loosely at best), but many references end up being someone else's opinion rather than a primary source. Since Mr. Shenkman is going out of his way to debunk American history it's hard not to take a lot of his debunking with a grain of salt."
5,STURDY AND ATTRACTIVE,"I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The coat rack is very sturdy and well balanced. I've put 5-6 heavy coats on it without distributing them evenly, and it hasn't tipped or fallen over.The umbrella rack on the bottom is a nice touch. Very nice looking, has a vintage look but can fit into any decor."
1,False advertising,"I placed an order for Hi-5, Vol. 1 - Color Craze. The dvd in box is false advertising, possible fraud dvd. The dvd box claims it contains 3 episodes, total running time 1 hour plus bonus features. The item I received does not contain any of the above items. My disc contained one episode with no menu options or closing credits. This disc might be a fraud copy. The color was very poor."
2,Not Sturdy,Bought this for my job's school dance. It broke apart very easily. It will not be able to with stand 8 coats.
3,alright....,"i must admit i am not the great fan for tribute albums considering after finish listening them. i would always pine for the original artists. but since this is off invisible and NOT cleopatra records, i figure why not pick up this up. i enjoyed some of tracks but not all of them. i would recommend this album if you're fans of boyd rice, the melvins, lesser and msbr. the rest of the album is alright...."
4,Great read,Kept me interested throughout the book I enjoyed this book a lot a must read for any boy or girl!
4,Alternate Realities,"It is easy to believe in the Auralites hidden island; Marsh's descriptions make it, as well as the characters, come alive. She pays attention to details, such as how the Auralites get along with humans on the mainland. Their history is a fascinating parallel to black and white relationships that is treated with delicacy and empathy.I came to care for Remy and Jace, as well as their equally well-drawn friends and relations. The plot has all the off-again on-again stress of a good love story with the added interest of finding out who is the betrayer of their culture. And when you do -- watch out, because you've already come to love this character. How the Auralites who will most suffer by the betrayal solve the problem leads to a satisfying end."
2,Don't be fooled by the picture and discription!,Even though there are two pictured and the description says transmitter/receiver his comes with only one unit. You will need two to operate.
4,Old School Classic,This was one of Jackie's first crazy films. It is difficult to understand at times but man it can be funny. Jackie plays a wanderer who wants to be a kung fu master and slowly learns the ropes from variouse teachers and masters. A good classic to have. Arm the Homeless
2,Warning - dogs can chew off pieces of this,"I thought the Nylabone would be a good thing for my Border Collie, since he likes to have a little something to gnaw on once in a while, and the product is advertised as safe and healthy. He likes chewing on these, but he is able to chew off large pieces of the bone - about 1/4 to 1/2 inch diameter chunks. He swallows them, then coughs, sounds like he's choking, and vomits the pieces up later. I don't feel safe giving him these."
4,Nice earphones for running,Overall the earphones met my expectation. They are quite steady and don't fall off from my ears while I run.
3,Good Bass response,"I liked the Headphones very much. They really do hook on pretty well. For best quality the supplied pads have to be used. The bass is awesome, it's different from all other headphones i have, most of which are sony. However, to get a really good acoustic effect, the volume has to be increased, more than other headphones. At the begining of songs for example.If you are a house music fan, or just like big beats, this is for you."
3,earbuds,"I got these headphones to run with because NONE of the others with any quality to the sound are water resistant and I have been through many sets that have stopped working due to exposure to sweat. They stay in good and no problems with moisture yet. The sound quality depends entirely upon the fit and seal that they have with the ear. One thing that I found that helped, as strange as it may sound was to place the buds in the opposite ear (right in the left and left in the right) and they seemed to fit better."
1,horrible,"Dont waste your money. I have what they call an average ear canal, and these things absolutely refuse to stay in my ear. I hate them. Save your money."
3,Just another set of earbuds,"These do stay put better than the buds that came with the ipod, but I didn't think the sound quality was really any noticeably better. You just can't get a good enough seal with bud type headphones to really get the sound that they are capable of delivering, I would recommend going with the in the canal type. But these are good for running or other activities where you need the headphones to stay put and/or handle some abuse."
3,"OK but has a ""tinny"" sound","I just bought these and if you tend to like the treble turned up on your music, then you'll like these. Otherwise you might want to look for something that has a more even bass/treble balance."
5,Finally an ear bud that stays in!,I just bought my second pair of this even though there is a new model. The new model doesn't have the green cushions that go in the top of the ear. The only reason I had to buy these again is because occassionally I lose the green rings when they are thrown around in my car and I ran out of rings entirely. The left speaker was coming apart after wearing it without a ring for so long. I just love them though. I agree with a previous reviewer that it would be nice to not have the shorter wire for the left ear-bud. Odd feature.
3,Broke after only 1 year of usage,"Get it! Perfect for running. Stays in your ears. Bought it 6 months ago and have run over 400 miles with it and no problem!UPDATE (Oct 31, 2010): It broke today after only one year of usage. Not good for the price I paid."
2,Over-priced,"These earphones are junk. Cheap construction leads to horrific sound with tinny base that bottoms out at high volumes, lots of distortion, and the rubber ear pieces all fell off within a month. The twist and fit design is a novel idea that does secure the ear buds for active pursuits, however they are uncomfortable when worn for a long time (e.g. plane rides) and useless once the rubber parts fall off. Two stars are given instead of zero because they do play music, so are slightly better than nothing."
1,You'd be better off buying a pair of turds,"Sennheiser should be ashamed to sell products of this low quality. The coiled cable is a terrible design that does nothing besides make them much harder to get untangled. The earphones come with a variety of little interchangeable parts but they attach so loosely that they are ripped off and lost within a matter of days under normal use (as in, putting them into and taking them out of your pocket). First, both of the decorative plastic pieces fell off. Then the rubber discs fell off that form part of the twist-to-fit system. Then the rubber rings around the speakers themselves fell off. I threw the earphones away after I had run out of the various spare parts that Sennheiser includes with the earphones.Moreover, the sound quality just isn't good. Not as good as the stock ipod earphones, and certainly not anywhere close to Sennheiser good."
2,Stay put but uncomfortable,These sound great and stay in place but are very uncomfortable. I would not buy again!
3,Pretty Good,"They work well once you figure out which piece works best for your ears. I would not recommend them for long distance runners though, after about 45min they started to hurt my ears."
3,Good sound but not as rugged as you would think,"These headphones do have good sound and are a step up from the Apple earbuds. The twist-to-fit system works well and keeps them in place even when I am running and cycling. I sweat a lot and they haven't shorted out.My only gripe, and it's a big one, is that the cord sheathing is worthless and has cracked and split on several places. It is also separating from the plug, leaving the wires exposed.I have contacted Sennheiser to see what they can do. The good thing is there is a two year warranty on them. So we'll see how this gets resolved and if they replace them.It's disappointing these haven't stood up better."
3,Falling bit short of expectation.,"The design is the best part of this headphone, the ear lock for active use is really functional. But coming from a sound quality comparison to the other CX-300s, the quality is a drastic difference. And the weight comparison is falling short abit."
3,"Great Sound, but not very duarable","The sound on this thing is great. Although, more bass could be used. The green rubber thing on the headphones keep falling out. Also the color is very unattractive."
2,"Poor fit, low durability, fair sound.","I love Senheiser and have several of their headphones. But, this one is questionable. The design is not as good as one would think, although it is intriguing. Sound is so-so, bass is weak. After a year of use the plastic coating came off, and the right ear bud stopped producing sound. I am a runner and use my headsets several times a week for an hour or two each time. This one does not hold up."
4,Sennheiser delivers!,"Reviewing specifically the Sennheiser model MX55. Was happy to find the cord length was equal for each bud, the twist-to-fit design really works, but hurts your ears a bit at first. Might try a tiny drop of crazy glue to keep the gaskets from flying off. Sound is very good. Definitely worth the price! Durability seems at par for the genre. Minus one star for the tangly cord & puzzle-box carrying case!"
2,Sennheiser MX75 Do Not Attach/Fit as Described,"I bought MX75 ""Twist-To-Fit"" hoping that they would stay secure in my ears as I ran. First, there were no instructions with the package describing how to ""twist and fit"" into my ear. I finally found a video with a few frames on the Sennheiser web site showing how they are to be inserted (no description). I repeatedly went in front of a mirror to duplicate the ""Twist-To-Fit"" process as shown in the video clip. It must be my Spock-like ears - I could not make it happen. They just fell out. I found that they were more secure when placed in my ears upside down to what is shown in the clip."
4,headphones,Great headphones for stability. First time I have been able to go running without them falling out. Lost some volume with how they are positioned but not much. Overall very happy with these.
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good, the different rubber cups are really good at changing the size. they seem to be designed for slightly bigger ears than mine though. Can be uncomfortable at times, but definitely secure fit."
2,"Problem with fit, not with sound or quality.","I really, really wanted these headphones. But, it turns out that my ears are too small. They fit into my friend's ears, but not mine. So the twist-to-fit only fits if you have large enough ears. My ears are on the smaller side, but not freakishly so!The sound was good, and the quality high. I really wish they would've fit."
2,Twist-To-Fall-Out,"I bought these headphones to wear at the gym based on reviews here, and I'm sorry to say they did not work for me at all. Maybe my ears are misshapen, but I could not get them to stay in securely, and the sweat factor only made things worse. I was constantly checking to see if they were on their way out of my ears, which was annoying. In addition, the cord drove me crazy. I was so perturbed by the fit and the cord that I cannot even speak to the sound quality. They are better than the ear buds that came with my iPod (how could they not be?), but that's about it."
3,hopeful,"I had another version of this product, with the volume control on the wire. The volume control broke on the old one after a few months which is why I got this version. The sound quality is very good for the price. I am just hoping this doesn't break over time."
2,Lacking quality-,The cord is very thin and does not lay flat it is like a plastic tube with a piece of dental floss in it and has zero heft and the sound quality is not very good. The ear clip is very unique but lacking comfort for my ears. I will not use these for running again I was pretty disappointed in the performance and comfort. I am keeping them for my sea-doo because it is not worth the time to return them but if I had it to do over again I would not have purchased them. I think I am going to try an over the head headphone system for running these just aren't the solution I was looking for to keep the ear buds in my ears while running. I recommend keep on looking! And the color is pretty awful too.
4,Great value for quality headphones,"After a reasonable amount of research, I was very happy to discover these very capable sport headphones. I have found that the sound quality is very good (including an excellent low end). The fit is comfortable, even after several hours of wear, and with several pad sizes included, there was some flexibility in terms of fitting my ear. I would almost say that my favorite feature is the cord. Unlike other sport headphones, this cord is a bit thicker and stiffer. Where some might consider this a detriment, I find that it makes the cord much less likely to tangle when not in use. I highly suggest these headphones. The quality and price make this a great buy."
3,First headphone purchase,"Needing a companion set for my IPod Touch led me to make this purchase. I found the sound quality very similar to the Apple headphones that came with the Touch. Inserting the Sennheisers into my ears took some practice, but I now have a technique that works. I appreciate the garment clip for wire control, and look forward to trying some of the different earpieces. With more experience (my first ever headphone purchase) I might have offered a stronger review."
4,Good headphones for the price - Different color than shown,"Overall, I'd say these are good sound quality for the price. The bass is good, but not great. For me personally, these fit me very well and I can't wait to use them for running.I do get upset over minor details and the color of the headphones I received are different from the picture. The plastic back of the headphone turned out to be a shiny metallic light green/blue. It is not white as shown in the picture. A small detail, but I wish I would have known before I bought them."
3,"Works well, but difficult to set up and WPA does not work","First let me say that my closet is filled with wireless equipment that just does not work. I bought this unit thinking that Motorola was a good company and I heard good things about their routers, and of course my bad luck with Linksys, DLink, Netgear.This unit was very hard to set up and takes a lot of networking knowledge to get it working. Once it works though it is a very nice unit and performs excellent.One other thing is even though the unit has a setting for WPA, IT DOES NOT WORK. A call to tech support, who answered quickly and was very friendly said that the unit does not support WPA, so the setting is useless. WEP works flawlessly.This unit would get 5 stars if WPA worked and the setup was easier."
1,works if you don't give up,"Spent hours and several phone calls with tech support. Finally got someone who kept working until she got it working. Set up wisard seems to be missing some steps. Wouldn't work when we changed the SSID and has to be on channel 11. Got it to work well using WEP64. It's currently working, but have had to deal with ""crash override"".This is not a solid piece of equip. I do have a Motorola w/l router that has worked great for almost a year. If the print server starts acting up I will probably replace both with another manufacturer.All the tech support staff I dealt with were pleasant and knowledgable, but not knowledgeble enough."
4,COLLECTOR OF OLD SCHOOL MUSIC,"I come from a time when music was music. Groups weren't just a group of people, but band members who actually played instruments. When listening to old school music, you not only hear good music, you feel it. It was this feeling that makes me gravitate back to the roots that grew some of todays hits."
4,They do the job,Not much to be said about this product. Just watch for a low price and then stock up!
4,Works very good. Shipment came quickly.,We were thankful that we had the extra wicks on hand when the other ones needed to be replaced.
1,Poor product,"These are not genuine Vornado filters. Nor are they even a usable substitute for the genuine product. They do not ""wick"" water in the humidifier. Don't be fooled by the price, and do not order this product!"
3,OK DEAL,"SHIPPED ON TIME PRODUCT TO EXPNESIVE CAN GET IT CHEAPER ON OTHER SITES . PRODUCT GETS CALSIFIED QUICKLY , FACTORY BRAND DID NOT. OVER ALL SO SO."
1,They smell! Not Vornado filters!,"When tearing the plastic wrapper, the smell was awful. I put them in the humidifier, and they continue to smell. I will have to throw them away. I will buy a new humidifier (I have two Vornados that are identical) that has a better filter system."
1,TERRIBLE SERVICE,Worst service ever! Never received book and had to contact Amazon to get a refund...
5,This series justifies the invention of the television medium,"I DID tape this when it was shown years ago in the US--all except for 15 minutes of it, when I didn't make it home to turn on the recorder! And as soon as I can afford it, I will purchase this set for those 15 minutes--it is worth every penny. This is Dennis Potter at his most brilliant. The Singing Detective changed my life. See it if you can. END"
5,Singing Dectective - DVD Edition,"One of the previous reviewers commented unfavourably on the image quality of this DVD set - it almost kept me from buying it. Almost... I did get it though, because I remembered it as one of the greatest things I had ever seen on television. Bearing in mind that this is a production for television, I can not find anything wrong with the image quality. The quality of the transfer has also been praised elsewhere. So don't worry, this is a great set."
4,Reliving the past,"I first saw ""The Singing Detective"" in 1986 in its original BBC airing when I was on my ""junior year abroad"" boondoggle (still the best year of my life, BTW). For the past 17 years, I've been convinced that it was the best television program I ever saw, even if memory is fleeting: Dennis Potter's complex, witty script, Joanne Whalley's heart-melting eyes, and the amazing performance of Michael Gambon have stuck with me.Seeing it again on DVD, I now realize that ""TSD"" is the ultimate horror movie, but is, somewhat unfortunately, not as otherworldly as I remembered. The performances are terrific, the dialogue is snappy, and Ms. Whalley's eyes are even better than I knew then, but the series is a melodrama that doesn't entirely satisfy. Potter was very, very good, and I highly recommend purchasing the DVD's, but I must warn you that it is almost too difficult to sit through, not due to the main character's medical problem(s), but because it is so emotionally raw."
4,A History of Histories,For a number of years I used Dampier's 1949 edition of A History of Science in a class I taught in the History of Western Science. This 1943 edition permitted me to make a comparison of Dampier's Pre-WWII ideas about the history and philosophy of science then and how he interpreted developments up to the immediate post-war days. I was glad to find this older edition in such a good condition.Mac McCollum
5,Great,Awesome music. I also bought other Lakewood Live music. I have this music on cd and love it. So i wanted it for my kindle.
3,Cleaning Kit,"Product not as expected. They sell it as a cleaning kit, but does not include the cleaning liquid. Not recomended"
4,Bossa Nova with Jazz beats or Jazz with Bossa Nova Influence??.,"This is a great album, but I agree with other reviewers, this is not your classic Sergio Mendes or the bossa nova album you are expecting. Great versions of the famous songs, no vocals with a very strong Jazz influence, you could almost say that is a Jazz record with Bossa Nova influence. So be ready to be sorprised, but still it makes a wonderful album to listen to. So enjoy it... but at the end you might ask yourselft, is this Sergio Mendes???."
4,Thanks to Carlos from Rio - - -,"I found out that the tremendous trombone player is Ed Maciel, as fast/great as the late Frank Rosolino. Should have asked Carlos about the flute player -- probably doubling-tripling on alto/tenor; also pretty darned terrific.I will ask Carlos in a future e-mail -- had the distinct pleasure to meet the gentleman when in Rio last time (I suggest a Saturday AFTERNOON stop at Allegro Bistro in the Modern Sound complex -- his jazz friends meet there while digging some wonderful music - yeah, in the afternoon!!)Enjoy!"
4,Almost 5 Stars...maybe if I live and savor it a bit longer.,"This starts out with an enchanting electronic, siren of a song called World of Wonders and continues to get better and better. Similar to October Project, Enya, and many other mood music but really something fresh about this disc. Well worth checking out. I just wish I could find something by U96 or Cork, the bands which F.R.E.U.D. members come from."
4,Cool CD,"I was introduced to them while listening to XM and liked the song ""Time Passengers,"" so I bought the album and wasn't disappointed. It's probably my most listened to CD right now."
3,Good filter but poor value,"This filter is way too expensive. Vornado must live by the razor blade business model - sell air filter units for cheap (well, not really) but charge obscene amounts for replacement filters.Pro tip: Buy the Filtrete Maximum Allergen Reduction 18x24 inch filter from the local hardware store. Cut/snip it in half and you get 2 filters for this Vornado for 1/5 the price per use. The cut edge won't be completely flush due to the corrugation, but some careful pressing/flattening on that edge will make it work."
5,Expensive filter!,"But, consider the number of years it is good for, I'd say the cost averages out just fine. Fit, form, and function are all good."
4,Acceptable Adventure,"While not as good as ""Ivanhoe,"" this movie is still a pleasing respite from all of the CGI-infused movies that are being cranked out nowdays. The pageantry is typically '50s Hollywood and, while some of the dialogue and plotlines may be thin, it's still a treat to watch and not get a headache from jumpy camera shots and rapid-fire dialogue that wreck so many of today's movies. All in all, not a great movie but certainly not as bad as the latest Bourne debacle."
5,"One of my favorite soundtracks, ever.","The soundtrack for this movie did a great job of supporting the very fine line between macabre and jocular tones that the director set for this movie. Nothing wrong with good old-fashioned, sociopathic fun!"
3,"Not Bad, at that.","I have long owned a Rival can opener but, after some 25 years, the drive wheel had lost its bite, and was not propelling the can. What I particularly liked about it was that the cutter was a wheel, which always left a clean edge to the can. The drive wheel was held in position by a screw and required only a new toothed wheel, easily changed, had it been available. I thought this model(CN738) worked in the same way, but see that its cutter is a blade. It will do, of course, but it's not perfect."
2,Not the best,"I don't know what it is with me and can openers, but it took me a few tries to finally get this thing to work. It wouldn't grab the can, maybe it's just me????????"
4,Chainsaw Safety Helmet,"As a usability expert and someone with way too many hours on a chainsaw, I can comfortably say that this helmet has been a great choice. The only issue, and it is minor, is that when cutting directly overhead with a dull blade (making sawdust instead of chips) the dust can get thru the screen visor into my eyes. (That is kind of like saying, when I ride my bike in the sand it is hard to pedal :-)it wasn't designed to overcome being used the wrong way; I shouldn't cut like that.) But I would much rather have this screen visor then a plexi visor which gets scratched and foggy in no time, and I could always put on goggles.I have given this hard use and it has saved me many bruises and cuts. I won't pick up my saw without putting it on; or the chaps and the vest for that matter. I had to go to the ER with a DEEP thigh cut before I got my chaps, maybe you'll learn from my mistake and get the chaps first."
5,Thanks!!,"I received and read A Journey To Hell and Back. To whoever recommended it for me, I thank them and God for sending the message to me. It was a very beautiful and inspirational book. I can relate to quite a bit of what she shared in her book - more so the loneliness, heartache(s), disappointments, teenage rebellion, and most definitely the legal system."
2,"Tedious and boring. Sorry, I was actually expecting to love this.","Based on all the ""this is the best photo book ever written"" reviews and what a few photographer friends mentioned to me also, I trusted that I would love this and went ahead and bought it. I forced myself to get about one third through it. This was just tedious and boring and hard to read, with a few very ""on the money"" remarks. A few times I felt ""ah haaa, now its picking up"" just for it to get tedious again. I would like to edit it down to about three interesting pages.He needed to apply his understanding of editing photographs to his writing also. I have no pressing desire to try to make myself get through the remaining two thirds just to see if it gets better. If it actually does, the book should just start there.Sorry Galen, I'm sure you were a nice guy and everything. Nothing personal."
5,Great memory card reader/writer!,"This reader/writer is the cheapest that I have found online or in stores! You can get it at office max for $19.99 and avoid the shipping. It really does work on many different kinds of cards. I've used it so far for compactflash, sd, and microsd (using the sd adapter of course) and it has been really easy to transfer pictures and music files for my mp3 player! When the computer reads it, it separates it as 4 different drives, one for each slot. It is small and lightweight. Highly recommend it."
1,"Zero stars isn't an option, or I would!","I agree with the first reviewer. This thing says 'incompetent' all over it! Maybe it works for other operating systems, but those of us using Win98SE, which it claims to support, it's a dud. I had the same experience as the other gentleman. I can't find a driver anywhere, and Sakar (the manufacturer) doesn't answer their phone. I have to go back to town tomorrow. I'll be taking this dog back to it's owner."
4,Strong pop production from Paolo Meneguzzi,"This is a strong album - it contains the powerhouse pop ballad ""Musica"" which, according to Wikipedia, is the best selling single in Italian history. But, the other songs are strong as well - there is no placeholder material here. It's a great mix of uptempo songs and pop ballads, but it has just enough of a clubby edge to not sound like the standard stuffy pop music you get from a lot of latin artists. His background as a DJ may be what helps him out in this regard. I'd opt for the Italian version over the Spanish version of the album - when you listen to both, the Italian versions just seem to have more life."
5,Very helpful & comforting for worried moms.,"This book is an EXCELLENT source of strength, insights, guidance, and most importantly HOPE for any parent. While the book covers all stages of a child's life, each section contains ideas and hope, regardless of the section's overall relevance to the stage you are at. While the book definitely has a Christain focus, it is not overbearing. The difference in my 21 year old daughter is nothing short of MIRACULOUS, especially in the last couple of months. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough for parents who are worried about their children. One of the few resources for parents of late-teen, early-twenty year olds."
2,Babylon 5 the movies (packaging),"The content of the movies is great no problems there, but getting a full set that isn't damaged seems to be a problem for Warner Brothers. Something in the way that they package the dvd's shakes movie disc one and three loose in the case. They then tend to get scratched by the center piece that is supposed to hold them in place. After two sets arrived damaged, I'm still waiting for a good set to be shipped to me."
4,Babylon 5: The Movie Collection,"DVD arrived on time, was exciting to watch all five movies in a row. Movies answered questions that the tv show didn't and had more adventures to continue the Babylon 5 world."
3,Content varies widely,"The problem here is that there are five movies, equivalent to ten episodes of the TV series in length, that vary in quality. The cost is a bit high to call this a good value.Thirdspace is pretty good. In The Beginning is great. I've watched it many times. The rest are just average. Last night I saw Call To Arms, as a prelude to watching the Crusade series I just bought. It sets up the premise of Crusade, but I thought overall it was missing something.I'd recommend seeing these shows before buying the set. I can however recommend In The Beginning without hesitation. (It comes with The Gathering on the same DVD.)Babylon 5: The Gathering/In the Beginning"
4,Excellant,This product was shipped promptly and perfectly new condition. I think the shipping may have caused couple of DVD's to shift but luckily none were scratched. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys science fiction.
5,"Great Book, Why is it not being published.","When I was about two or three, a friend gave us our original copy of ""Catch Me and Kiss Me,"" We read it so many times that it fell apart and it was thrown away. Luckilly I was able to get a used copy not so long ago. This book has so many favorite poems that we still quote such as,Phoebe in a Rosebush, Phoebe in a Tree.There's Many a Phoebe in the World,But You're the one For me.andCockyolly Bumkin Merry Go BetFell in the Duckpond and Got all WetA Nickle For a Nappy and a Penny For a PenTo Dress My Little Cockyolly Bumkin inandDo the Baby Cake WalkA One Step a Two StepA Wobble and A Bobble in the KneeWith a Toe Heel Toe and A Giddy Go Round You GoWon't You Do the Baby Cake Walk for Me.Anyway I could go on and on, but this book is a treasure, and it is a sin that it is out of print. Any Publishers out there. PLEASE REPRINT ""CATCH ME AND KISS ME AND SAY IT AGAIN."""
5,This book is invaluable for all adults who have children.,"This book is something that our whole family has treasured. It contains poems such as Cockyolly Bumkin, and Phoebe in a Rosebush. I've read it to my sister and to my cousins, when they were little. I just wish somebody would do a re-print of it."
4,Read this series,"Even though it's strength is fading, Dietz's books are some of the best written military fantasy/science fiction out there.I did like the fact that the first novels continually changed the heroes, but even straying from this line Dietz still managed to produce a strong book.I certainly recommend reading this entire series."
4,For those that enjoy military SF...,"While the author's style adds little to push the edge of the envelope in SciFi it is, when action is presented, a fast paced exciting read. This helps to cover the logic inconsistencies that pop-up from time to time. His character development leans too heavily on sterotypes, but that doesn't get in the way of the story line. One petty observation, my First Edition had far too many typos, errors and word ommissions, which I hope will be corrected in future editions. I make enough of these myself..."
1,Don't waste your money!,This book is a prime example of the pitfalls of self-published books. All it takes to be published is paying the listed fee. Quality and accuracy are not a requirement.A little checking has turned up the fact that author has never been employed by NASA and was never on the shuttle investigation team. The inconsistencies and ramblings grow from there.No redeaming value as either a commentary on the space program or entrepreneurship. I suggest looking elsewhere for a real book.
4,Great addition to my collection!,"Paid a premium price for these discs, but it was worth it. Despite a few mainstream hits that could have been replaced withmore 'dangerous' songs, maybe by Gene Vincent for example, most of these songs are keepers - stuff I didn't know existed, and would be very hard to find on their own.All in all, an excellent addition to anyone's 1950s music collection. For the most part, this is the stuff parents didn't want their kids listening to. Some of it was banned from the radio; a few songs the record companies would not put out. If you want a taste of the 'underground' music of the 50s, get this set."
5,He was stunned.,I bought this as a Christmas Present for my significant other. He could not believe that I had found something he had when he was a teenager. It arrived in a timely fashion. It was good quality.
3,Great but....,Great collection but the first CD skips in my computer's(DELL) CD player which translated to chopped off songs in my IPod.
3,Movie better,"I was disappointed reading this after watching the movie. I thought the book was too long and detailed with things that weren't that important to the theme. I usually like the book better than the movie, but not this time.The movie was much better and more enjoyable."
3,Tepid,"Miklos Szenthelyi is a fine violinist. I have a CD of solo works by him that I'm very happy with. Unfortunately, his Beethoven is a lesser achievement. The concerto moves along at sensible tempos and is pretty well recorded. Unfortunately, nothing much happens. Szenthelyi has a good grasp of the technical problems of the work, but he plays with very little passion. In fact, his total approach may best be described as diffident. The Romances start off in a more promising manner, but inevitably succumb to the same sort of tiredness and lack of inspiration. As for the Minuet, it does not sound as if it is by these performers. I strongly suspect Laserlight of including an uncredited performance by the Budapest Strings. If you are looking for a cheap recording of the Beethoven Concerto in good digital sound, there is an excellent version by Takako Nishizaki on Naxos."
5,Montcalm and Wolfe,"Although a bit tedious at times, Francis Parkman gathers all facts leading up to the climax at the Plains of Abraham."
2,Not for today,"As literature, its as good as historical writing gets. As history, its racist to the bone."
2,There are better ways to spend your money,"I bought this book in preparation for the CLEP Introductory Psychology exam, but I haven't used it much. I took the CLEP exam two days ago, and thumbing through the book just now, the questions in the book just don't seem to coincide much with the content of the computerized CLEP exam. Perhaps the questions are from old test banks, or it could be that the author just winged it. I dunno.So is this book worthless? Well, no. It could be of some value in preparing for the CLEP exam. Still, I largely agree with other reviews on this page, and I don't think the price of the book is worth the modest return a reader is likely to get back from it. I'd suggest buying the official CLEP guide instead, and following the exam outline to prepare. .... For a more modest outlay, the Psychology video from the Standard Deviants is also a good exam prep resource."
4,"Entertaining, But something's missing","I enjoyed this book quite a bit, especially since I was reading it while taking a women in religion class. Many of the topics addressed in this book were addressed in my class, and likewise, many class topics were in the book. However, I do not feel that this book incorporates enough mainstream world religion into its analyses. I feel that the majority of the book correctly analyzes themes of certain Buffy episodes, and includes some great quotes, but doesn't really discuss Buffy's relationship to already standing religions, or a new ""buffy"" religion.Basically, this book says ""Christianity, buddhism, and hinduism all have these practices that let people be nice to each other. Buffy has these practices too, see?"" This book wants us to be nice because Buffy was nice. That's all I got out of it. But it's entertaining and a worthwhile read for Buffy fans."
4,The Tragic Heroine's Spiritual Journey,Of course fans will really enjoy another look into the Buffyverse but I do feel this book goes deeper than that.The author takes her knowledge and pulls us on a journey into the development of the spirt as portrayed by our favorite Slayer.The book does read a bit like a thesis but iwas well worth a read. I especially liked the episdoe guides and quotes that she uses throughout the book. A must for fans and a might :) for anyone on their own spirtiual quest.
1,Voices from S-21,"A very good book that offer insights into what made drove these mad men to kill their own people. They were as horrible as Hitler, Moussolini, Mao (their mentor), and Saddam. Highly recommended."
2,Cover?,I haven't actually seen the video. I just am really thrown off by the its cover. You would have thought the Mets won. What's up with that?
1,Didn't the Mets lose?!?,"I haven't seen the video, but now I definitely won't. Look at the cover! It looks as if the New York Mets won the World Series and even titles them as World Champions. If I recall correctly, and I believe I do, the New York YANKEES won! How can I reasonably consider buying this video with this huge faux pax staring me in the face.I guess the Mets must have had their runs recounted in Florida and declared themselves the victor . . ."
4,Entertaining and Will Not Disappoint,"This video is very entertaining. It's what you expect in a movie (one that entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll). I wasn't disappointed in the least with this video.It has comedy, suspense, mystery, action, and most of all, a believable storyline. I won't even go into the plot because it will give the whole story away. And this won't make much sense, but when you get the video, you will understand what I am saying... this movie is what you want it to be. TRUST ME.It will be the best movie you haven't seen. A major newspaper reviewer said it was the greatest movie hardly anyone has seen, and the paper is starting to launch a campaign to get it remade in 2002."
4,English language guide to traditional Flamenco Music,"Flamenco singing, which is the heart of this traditional art, is almost unknown to U.S. audiences because of its intense personal style, which is frankly embarrasing to English-speaking audiences, and the relative inaccesibility of its lyrics. Serrano and Elgorriaga's book makes a figurative leap over these hurdles toward its readers through in-depth explanations of the singing technique and precise translations of the Spanish text. The first half of the book relates some of the major recent developments of flamenco through the biography of Juan Serrano, guitar accompanist, solo performer/composer, and co-author. The second portion gives examples of the phrasing, voice quality, and inspiration of the singers in text and on the accompanying cassette (highly recommended). I would give five stars to this book had it included a section on some of the brilliant new performers of today who represent a new direction in flamenco music."
2,Very disappointing,"Based on the reviews I read here, I had expected something very different. But I found Nick, the hero, to be rather irritating, and the heroine, Aurora, was brainless. Whenever Aurora tried to explain that she was terrified of something, Nick would just start kissing her and throw up her skirts. And like a brainless idiot, she would melt in helpless passion then later agree with Nick that she was somehow to blame. I wanted to slap her.The secondary characters popped in and out without having much depth. Several promising story lines were never followed - the violently angry father, the hoyden half sister, the jilted fiancee, the famous rake - they never had much of a part in making an interesting subplot. It seemed to me, the plot consisted of having Nick think of ways to shut Aurora up by taking her to bed."
5,"Got to love ""pirates""","Actually the hero Nic is not a true pirate, but a man trying to protect the dying wishes of a father. The way the couple meet is fabulous and quite unexpected...in jail. The strengths of the leading lady given the times is quite admirable. She rescues without question and that includes the hero. The sexual tension is all Nicole Jordan...never disappointing. I had my fingers crossed in the end hoping that love would win out over loyalty. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who recognizes the ""bad"" in themselves...and those who don't."
2,Great features for a bad movie,I love when movies have commentary but a bad movie brings bad commentary. Maybe worth a rent but don't waste your money like I did.
3,Texas Rangers Ride!,"This book, parts of which were published in the 1970's as The Rustlers of Pecos County using different character and place names, is an okay book. It is one of only a handful of Zane Grey ""fiction"" books written in first person, and my opinion is, Zane Grey didn't handle first person prose very well when writing fiction. But aside from that this is a basic shoot-em up written early in his career, rejected by Harpers editors, and eventually combined with another book, Last of the Duanes, to form what many consider one of Zane Grey's best, The Lone Star Ranger. To fashion and custom of the times, this book is historically accurate and well crafted, but it just lacks the one element to make it great which I have yet to put my finger on. But it's Zane Grey, so how bad can it be? It's not bad, there are others just better. So, I say, buy it and read it for yourself and give it your rating."
3,Saucony Origionals Mens Jazz Pro Sneaker,"This is a great walking shoe. Great on the feet if walking a lot. Right side fits differntly than left near toes, leather sewed below bottom of shoelace in shoe is tighter on right than left. But is still and okay but irritating."
4,lol ok ok,Nice shoes much thinner material than I'd anticipated but woah very comfortable and look nice thanq for everything saucony <3
3,Not for your Large and heavy men,"First I'd like to say I'm a BIG man, 6'1"" at 350 lbs. I bought these shoes on the reviews of there comfort, and they aren't bad. But for $30 I won't be buying a second set. Within the first week the sides of my feet started to wear through the liner to the point it's starting to tear and you can see where my heels have rubbed under the liner. They're comfortable to a point, I wouldn't go walking around for over 6 or 8 hours. The sides feel like a very... soft material, like the interior liners of a jacket so I'm not sure how they'll respond to dirt. But will say they do keep my feet the right temperature. The leather is soft which is nice. If you're like me when it comes to tying your shoes where you grab maybe the last row or two to tighten then tie them, you'll notice very uneven pressure on the top of your feet.In short, not a bad shoe, just not made for a big man like myself."
4,ROLO CARGO CARRIER,I SHOPPED FOR AWILE TO FIND THE CARGO CARRIER I THOUGHT WOULD WORK BEST FOR TWO DIFFERENT CARS. THE CONVERTIBLE WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM! I NEED A LIGHTER STYLE WITH BETTER GROUND CLEARANCE AND WAS ORRIGINALLY LOOKING AT ALUMINUN STYLES. THE ROLO MODEL IS NICE AND LIGHT SEEMS VERY STRONG AND HAS A RAISED SHANK WHICH GIVES ME MORE GROUND CLEARANCE. ITS ALSO MORE STYLISH AND DOESN'T LOOK OUT OF PLACE ON THE CAR. ONLY PROBLEM WAS ONE OF THE REFLECTOR STICKERS HAS ALREADY COME OFF. EASY FIX.
4,A delightful presentation of a hilarious Shakespeare farce,"Alec McCowen and Anna Massey lead a sparkling cast in this audio version of Shakespeare's comedy (perhaps ""farce"" is a better word, given the unreality of the premise of twin sons with twin servants, all of whom are constantly mistaken for each other and mistaking each other). At just under 90 minutes, this is somewhat shorter than some of the other Caedmon Audio recordings, but it presents the complete text of the play in a lively performance. John Moffatt deserves special mention as Antipholus of Ephesus: urbane, cool, well-spoken, and not above shamelessly cheating on his wife! The recorded sound, remastered from a 1967 recording, is splendid."
4,My review of Secret of Childhood,I have not read this book yet but gave it a four because every other book on Maria Montessori and by her I have given a four
1,Amazon Lies about their shipping,I bought this item over two weeks ago. It said .. ships in 24 hours... still says this.... yet two weeks later and only after I wrote and said .. wheres my stuff they write back and say .. we shipped it today and it will be there in another 10 days..... BUYER BEWARE
1,simply awful...,read the thoughts of someone who would die to be Debord but is instead a third-class intellectual. and a mentally handicaped one too.there has been criticism directed against Debord and the SI that has been constructive and insightful. this however is one of the worst literature on the subject - if not THE worst.
1,Crap!,"Got this gun for my stepson for christmas, it broke putting it together and i am actually on the phone right now typing this review because once i finally got ahold of human being on the phone, he didnt barley speak engligh, cant find my information and now i have a broken gun that i paid double the price they have on here now for. great."
5,Queen Magic Years,"This is a great doc. of Queen, one of the greatest groups in the worls and without a doubt, the greatest singer in the world. This is a botleg and you can find on eBay for about $15 with free shipping."
3,What's it made of? Safe material?,"I haven't used it yet because it occurred to me that it may be made of teflon, which can put toxins in the air when heated. I need to research it before deciding what to do with it."
5,Surprisingly good undiscovered soul album,"With a strong, gritty voice, a likeable, unpretentious style, and a fairly obscure crew of producers and backing musicians, the underrated Greg Walker lays down a great set of soulful grooves here, and the robust solidity of these songs is very good for something so obscure. The best track is the haunting, melodic ballad ""Blind,"" but all of the songs are great, and though he goes midtempo on a few of them, he never gets hip-hoppish or lets anything distract from the prominence of his great voice."
2,TOTAL Gundam Wing???,"If you are going to buy this book for pure reading pleasure and maybe SOME helpful background information, then go for it. There is definitely some helpful info in it, and some awesome pictures, but I wouldn't base anything from the show on it. Also, on the cover it BOLDLY display the words ""Card Price Guide"" & ""Toy and Model Price guide"" and there's nothing close to either of those. So altogether it's a decent book, but I wouldn't recommend spending full price on it."
1,Never Correctly Repaired; Replacement Offered,"I had bought an Alera CD Copier some years ago and it worked fine - when it died I bought this one. It worked fine for a few months and then for various reasons wouldn't copy. I have so far sent it back THREE times - even though they paid for the return postage the last time I sent it back, it had exactly the same problem when I received it. On the good side; they did offer to replace the unit which is good customer service in that respect"
3,Poems from the North,"This book highlights the poetry of one of the most famous Scandinavian writers of the 20th century; Edith Sodergran. I read them as part of a class I took in Scandinavian literature. I found the poems interesting, and not as depressing as romantic poems of other Western writers."
4,An old but good book,"My grandmother gave me a pretty beat up copy of this book before she died. It had once belong to her brother who had worked for the Dept. of Agriculture. That was the 1941 version, but I decided to go ahead and buy this 1970 version to use in the field. This book has good descriptions and great illustrations and photos. One thing to consider though, due to it's age, some of the scientific names may have changed since then. Oh, and the 1941 version had a nicer illustrated cover."
5,Great!,"This book is great with very exiting parts. In the beginning, the children(Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) are wisked away from the train station to Narnia. The old Narnian Kings and Queens find that the land has been captured by the cruel King Miraz. There are no longer talking beasts, and the land seems very empty. The children team up with the Prince Caspian to... Well, you will just have to read this great book for yourself to see what happens!"
4,A Sign of Maturation,"From the cute and loving (and yet serious and deep) tone of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" Lewis takes his fantastical stories even further, proving that this dreamworld of his is more than just a Witch and a Lion, but that there are histories, lives, and truths that are just waiting to be told about Narnia.Even though this book is definitely a turn for those familiar with the lightheartedness of his first Narnian epic, Lewis' second installation brings more depth and believability to his characters, albeit the darker and bloodier tone this book generates.Without the rest of his books, Lewis' first classic might have just been another fairy tale that ends when the book is shut. But with the other six installments, the stories get bigger and deeper, and the world of Narnia becomes even more real."
3,Perhaps the least engaging of the Chronicles of Narnia,"After a work of such renown as the Lion, the Witch and theWardrobe, perhaps it is just too much for the next in the series tocompare. Of all the Chronicles, I found this to be the least engaging. I found it a small let-down to find myself in Narnia again so far in time from the Pevensies' reigns as Kings and Queens. The plot did not move me along as well as any of the other books in the Chronicles.This is the last book in the Chronicles in which all four of the children are back, and in that way, it provides for a nostalgic return to the Narnia of The Lion... The most interesting aspect was of how the conquering people had come to fear the trees and magic of the land, illustrating how conquerers and empires often despise and oppress what makes a people individual.Bottom Line: This one isn't bad enough to skip over, but it's a bit of a let down after the stellar first volume."
5,Loved It,"I really like C.S Lewis and think that God blessed him with a talent of writing. The Chronicles of Narnia was well written and I did not want to put the books down, this is coming form someone that is not a big reader. He also puts little life lessons in each of the books, you will just have to read it and find them yourself."
5,Wonderful Story,"No one can capture the heart of children and adults alike quite the way C.S. Lewis did with the Chronicles of Narnia. The movies that have been are great, no doubt, but nothing compares to the actual books. Prince Caspian was actually my favorite of the three Walden Media movies and is a great book as well. Though it's very different from the movie it's still captivating and full of wonder and excitement."
4,weakest of the series,"'Prince Caspian' finds Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy getting ready to return to school at the end of summer holidays, when they are suddenly pulled by magic into another world. Of course, at once they suspect they are back in Narnia, but nothing seems familiar to them. It turns out while only a year has passed in our wold, centuries have passed in Narnia.This is the second published book in the series (4th in the internal chronolgy). The first 2/3rds of the book are quite good, as the kids realise where (and when) they are, encounter Trumpkin the dwarf and learn of the recent history of Narnia, and the story of young Prince Caspian.However once they reach Caspian the story really sags, as it just seems the characters wait around until Aslan fixes everything.The Christian references are toned down a little in this one. All in all the weakest of the series -probably closer to 3 1/2 stars."
4,Great deal,"I've collected all the 1st edition reproductions of the Chronicles of Narnia series, however I have to say that the U.S. edition printing was on slightly better paper. The U.K. editions are printed on ""eco-friendly"" recycled (i think) paper, but the paper isn't as fine or smooth and seems a bit cheaper than the american edition. Even the jackets don't have that satin feel, but rather seem to be made out of basic uncoated paper.All in all though, beautiful book, with nice color picture on the inside page"
4,Prince Caspian,There were no torn pages and the cover was secure. There were no marks on it. i did expect it not to be as worn as it was. overall the book was fine.
3,My English homework,"In the book Prince Caspian it starts out with the four Pevensies (The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe) are magically pulled back to Narnia to help the Prince. This book I can not honestly was the best that I have read out of the series mainly because it does not offer as much backround details as the others, but also because it is a pretty slow moving story which causes you to get bored. Even so though I would have to say that it was still a very good book. One main thing that I would recommend is to read this whole series in their ORIGINAL order because I believe that C.S. Lewis designed them like that to add the suspense and wonder to your reading. Although this book I would have to say is not the best out of the series I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good book."
3,Stealing Time for Peter Facinelli,"I only bought this movie to see Peter Facinelli, and it ended up being ok. Actually, it was on pace pretty well and I was interested for sure as it has a very compelling premise, but the ending was very cliche and anticlimactic. The acting was all around good, but I probably wouldn't recommend Stealing Time to anyone."
4,Good folding saw,"Have paid only $15, I found this to be a good product for the cash. The course blade is 6"" and will cut through wood, hard or soft. A good product to throw in ones car or to just have on hand. Are there better on the market? Probably, but this a good tool for the cash."
2,poor quality,I was breaking one of these every year. save your money and get a stronger one from a garden center.
1,Looks Like a Student Film,"Ridiculously bad movie. Looks like it was shot with a camcorder, badly lit, grainy visuals, grotesquely amateurish acting, laughable fight sequences. Save your money.If you want to watch a GOOD movie about doppelgangers, try Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
5,Big Stereo Sound,"This CD seems to have been recordedby a superintelligent mouse whichwas inside the piano. You can hearthe pianist breathing, the floorboardscracking, and the audience sneezing.The piano playing is incredible, andthe sound of the Chopin left hand isthunderous and clear on a large stereoor a set of good headphones. The piecesare well chosen. There really is noother piano CD left that gives themusic hall experience as well as therich, detailed and colorful piano playing.This is a significant recording."
4,quick & inexpensive,"I got the CD within 3 days and it was it great shape, I couldn't even find it here in this city let alone at such a great deal. Thanks!"
3,"Good, But Otherwise Wrong","While this film is very interesting and fun to watch, the movie suffers because it's untrue. Yes this story really happened. Yes these people are real. However, the book this movie is based on, by Thomas Allen, is horribly inaccurate. And so is this movie. His locations to where the boy came from and where it happened, is all wrong. Never came from these places and never lived there. His father also never thought he was possessed. It is a fun movie in it's own right tho."
5,Avalon`web of magic Trial by fire,This book was awesome! It kept me reading ! the secrets sad but it's a good read for book reports! my teacher was wowed!
1,TERRIBLE SERVICE.,I ordered this book over a month ago and still have not received it. When I emailed them they assured me it was on the way. That was a week ago and still have not received it. Don't waste your money!
5,A BOY SEES A LADY GET MURDERED BUT HIS FOLKS WON'T LISTEN,This book is really good. A boy always sits in this cherry tree when he's upset and one day the mean lady next door turns up hung on that very tree but earlier that day he saw a big armed guy strangeling something in the houde and thinks it was murder not accidental scuicide. He trys to tell his people that she was murdered but they're too busy tring to prepare for the wedding(his aunt's wedding) that they are too busy to try and listen. He finally gets them to listen and it turns out....READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT!
3,Jason's Review,I liked this book because it was exciting. I also didn't know what was going to happen next. Willow Davis Roberts is my favorite Adventure/Thriller writer.This book is about a boy named Rob who likes to hang out in a cherry tree in his yard. One day while sitting in the tree he thinks he saw his neighbor Mrs. Calloway get pushed out of her window. So he tries to tell someone but his parents are too busy with his sister's wedding to listen to him and when he calls the police they think he is just some kid making a prank call. So Rob has to try and survive this weekend until his sister's wedding is over to tell anyone. But will the murderer get to him first?I would recommend this book to someone who likes action and thriller books because this book is very exciting and I enjoyed it.
1,Cheaply made,"It broke on me after 3-4 uses. The hose doesn't roll up unless so effort is put into it. Also, as you crank, it tends to skip around due to its weight and overall poor build quality.Don't waste your money."
1,no quality control,"first purchase had two left frames---replacement had no parts bag-- call to Co.,Sara, would send parts bag--that was over 3 wks ago--- three strikes your out"
1,1980's junk,"Was very disappointed in this. Wasn't even a book, was a spiral notebook from the 80's that said it was new! Total garbage"
5,Solid British Power Blues,"A solid collection of progressive era British folk/blues. The tune ""Thank Christ for the Bomb"", is especially interesting. Its starts out as an acoustic blues ballad which, around the 3:00 mark, turns up the heat to become an incredible acid blues jam. If you're a fan of early Jethro Tull or Blodwyn Pig, you'll enjoy this album."
5,Mastering the Old Testament,"These Bible commentaries are excllent for anyone desiring to know and understand the Word of God. They provide historical context and background information cross referencing other related books of the Bible. I am not a Bible scholar nor pastor, but one searching for depth and truth. They are a great help."
4,Even-handed despite sensationalism,"I feared a muckfest driven by author's urge to sell copy by mining poorly researched intonations of Harding's mixed-race heritage. Not so - a comprehensive review of the man, the character and the foibles are well presented. Excellent weave of the inscrutable strands of political fate that lead such an ordinary individual to presidential office. Especially revealing are the facts of his romantic dalliances (altho some text deletion due to lawsuit injunction) which reveal a simple-minded hedonist at the core. Very engaging read."
1,"ONLY get this is you are a Yanks fan, which I am not. . .","This was a sad World Series. It pretty much let us know that the Yankees were permanantly out of their 80's Losing Basement, and back to world champions. . .unfortunately.Except Yanks fans, most people feel the way I do about the Yankees - they're bad for baseball and watching them win gets realllly old after a while. So only buy this if you are a Yankees fan, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I'm not so sure about anyone else, though. . ."
5,Awesome!,"Exceptional work by the Wilson sisters and the band! The video and audio are primo and well worth the investment...I love Nancy Wilson, (total HOTTIE at any age)!!!"
2,mediocre,"i have seen heart live 3 times, this is ok at best,picture is fair, music is ok,but not of great quality"
4,fillmore flashback,"I remember seeing Blue Cheer at the Fillmore in New York City and what blew me away was the wall of Marshall amps.They were loud, different,and way ahead of their time. I went right out and bought Vincebus as soon as I could. Summertime Blues was the only song that ever had a modicum of success but any serious classic rock collection is incomplete without it."
2,no bang here,blue cheer was great / loud/ psychedelic distortion / a real treat for acid heads and rebels of the time / mind blowing racks of marshals stacked 15 feet high and 30 feet wide / unfortunately the sound quality on this cd is so bad you can not experience a fraction of the experience of their music by listening to this cd / do not buy this cd / it's just terrible sound with the vocals all up front loaded without the signature sound of the guitars / very bad /this cd needs to be remastered / don't waste your time or money
5,Blues Deconstruction Meets White Noise Gloriously,"Imagine Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience getting together for a collaboration, and imbibing a few hundred amphetamines before playing a note, and you have ""Vincebus Eruptum"" in a heartbeat. Blue Cheer, on their debut album, was the all-time blues deconstruction band - ""Doctor, Please"" is the kind of shattering, abstractionist breakdown the like of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion only WISH they had the nerve to take up. Their few overdubs (""Out of Focus""'s guitar break; the berserk feedback guitars of the ""Second Time Around"" solo break and finale) are as amateurish as they come, but for blasting the pretenses of the late 1960s wanna-be power blues bands to smithereens, it isn't even close. They went from here to something approaching normalcy, and it wasn't the same. They also inadvertently midwifed heavy metal, which is another story altogether..."
4,hard hitting strong messages,With the hard hitting sounds of summertime blues I was drawn to this album when it first was released and find that the years have not diminished the powerful emotions that this album brings up when I listen to it again. My old vinyl copy of this stills plays but with the wear of many playings it was nice to hear this again as a fresh source to return to my youth when the congressman said...
5,split part two,Split part two is posibly the best British blues records ever. let me know if any one else has heard it.
4,"Tight, sharp, taut--classic film noir","The short (73 minutes) of this film is not a problem at all; Anthony Mann's direction is so strong that there's no wasted moment. While some films noir suffer from being overly stiff (cf. The Big Combo), this one's fluidity is definitely in evidence. John Ireland is the standout here, but the two female leads--Sheila Ryan and Jane Randolph--are almost as good. A real plus, plotwise, is the 'good girl' falling (at least temporarily) for the bad guy.Similarly, the 'bad girl' ultimately turns good. These reversals, coupled with the bad guy's peculiar behavior (the infamous perfuming of his bullets) and an unusual shoot-out in a long-after-closing bar full of upside-down barstools make for an interesting film.Hugh Beaumont's good guy cop is a well-matched foil to John Ireland's Duke Martin, whose occasionally drunk girlfriend meets with Beaumont, near the end, to rat out what she thinks is her two-timing boyfriend.Definitely one of the better films noir on DVD."
1,History For Christians Who Don't Care Much For History,"I got this book as part of a curriculum package for my second grader. I decided to pre-read it to see how it was, because a lot of people had mentioned problems with it.Boy, were they right!You can't read a single chapter without finding an inaccuracy. The tone of the book is condescending. The viewpoint is emphatically Christian. I know some Christian home-schoolers have complained that the book isn't Christian enough, but what they seem to mean is that it doesn't hold to their anti-evolutionary ideas. I have the most recent edition and much of the racism in the prior editions has been removed, but this is absolutely not a secular resource, not can it be easily secularized. Later in the book, as it gets into modern times, the text is not longer the story of history but rather a litany of atrocities. It's no longer a story, and neither interesting for nor suited to early elementary students.I spent extra money on a different text."
3,"Too similiar to her previous CD ""Footprints on the Ceiling""","I feel that the CD ""Bone Me Like You Own Me"" was just a rework on the CD ""Footprints on the Ceiling"". I truly feel gyped by Barbara Carr. She took at least two songs from ""Footprints..."" and just rewrote the words."
4,Nice Cage,"I own an Avian Adventures Hacienda Bird Cage and both me and my Miligold Macaw Sunshine like it. It's not as big as I thought it would be but working in the bird business it is definitely one of the largest single bird cages I have seen. It is built to last and if you have an escape artist for a bird then this cage is the best choice out there. It is VERY easy to put together since there is NO screws or bolts to mess with, simply SNAP it together and you're ready to go. I LOVE the Avian Adventures brand and own 2 cages by them, the Hacienda Dome Top and Castillo Play Top. Both my Macaw and Umbrella Cockatoo LOVE them and have plenty of room to play and entertain themselves when I am not home. I would STRONGLY recommend Avian Adventures to any one who owns a bird and wants to make sure that have a SAFE and ROOMY environment to live and play in!!!"
4,The best Savatage work,"I gave this CD 4 starts just becuase I guess 5 star is a masterpiece, like Dark Side Of the Moon or something like this. This album is 4.5!Unlike some reviewers below I don't think this album is step back for Savatage. In fact, it is first Savatage efford I have been listening for a long time!Perhaps, from point of a die-hard heavy-metal head this album is worse, then ""Hall Of .."", but not for me. ""Hall"" is great classic metal album, but, in my taste, is pretty strightforward.So, as prog rock and prog metal fun I prefer Poets much more!This album is also much better, then Magellan and Dead Winter, in my humble opinion. Although the latters have their great moments, some parts of them are pretty boring for me.This album has perfect balance of melodies, smart arrangement and agressions of classic heavy metal.Great progressive metal!Yes, Jon Oliva's vocal is not as strong as it used to be, but it feets the music perfectly!You won't be disappointed!"
5,Good but wanna hear Zak at vocals...,"A very very good Savatage album. I personally want to congratulate Chris Caffery on his incredible performence with both guitars. I mean wow... I think this one has the best gutiar riffs ever on a savatage album espacialy the part in Drive i never heard anything like it before... With all due respect and great affection to Mr. Oliva i still think that he cant replace Zak Stevens' place. I know thaht he is the founding vocalist but i always liked Zak's vocal better. And there are times in the album, you feel that Jon's voice is not enough and a little too bass for the song. You'll see what i mean when you litsen the album. Anyway it is a great album and a must buy for a Savatage and Progressive fan. Get it you wont regret...PS: The picture is very funny but i really think that they could find a prettier woman. <You'll get it when you buy the cd :=) >"
3,"slow to go anywhere,with some loose ends","Always on the lookout on new authors/series,I ordered this one.Didn't hate it,otherreaders would like it if they aren't expectingtoo much."
2,Could have been great...,"I generally like Stross. This book feels like it is a resurrected early novella that was stretched to novel length. Well, almost. It is two stories really. I was rather startled when the first one wrapped up so soon.The first story is rather clever in premise and reminded me very much of Christopher Moore'sA Dirty Job: A NovelBut as good as this could have been, it came up short.I didn't read the second story as I generally don't enjoy short stories. And it looked like a short story..."
3,Unimpressive story with buzzwords mixed in,"If you get annoyed at Star Trek for inventing tech to solve a plot problem, giving it a techy-sounding name, and then explaining it in moron terms, this book will annoy you in exactly the same way."
4,The Dirty Water of Boston's Politics and Gangs,"Carr gives a whirlwind view of Boston gangsters and politics andshows how the likes of H. Paul Rico and John ""Zip"" Connollyhelped Whitey Bulger, and the ""everything is a deal, no dealtoo small"" political climate served Billy well. From murdering girlfriends who knew too much to hobnobbing with the likes ofKennedy and Kerry at that annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast,the Brothers Bulger got away with murder and corruption. A fewamusing anecdotes, like how Gerry Anguilo, upon being informedthat a fellow gangster was dead, shouted, ""He can't be dead!He owes me $30,000!!"" Can't make up stuff like that.Fans of Carr's column and radio show should be delighted.He has more photos and information at his various websites."
4,The Brothers Bulger,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The amount of detail the author was able to share was fascinating and hardly comprehendible at times, in a good way. How do so many people, on so many levels, inside and outside of government, get away with such atrocities and crooked behavior for so long? It's a crazy ride through a world that most of us never have contact with. Great, great book!"
2,Book condition,"The book was listed as like new and it was not. It looked very used and since it was a gift, I wasn't happy. I thought it was a hardbound book, but that may have been my mistake. For a coupld dollars more, I could have bought a new paperback new in the store."
1,Check Out Line Journalism,"Carr has strung together a career's worth of Boston Herald stories, glued them together with innuendo, slapped a cover on it and is looking for a $15 impulse buy.The writing has an exasperted quality that suggests that the author is invested personally in the story. It makes the re-recitation of 'facts' appear as an effort to cast every conclusion as foregone, and that readers should just let the author do his thinking for them. And the ""weighty"" thesis that these brothers are one in the same is just this side of the ""Weekly World News"".If you want a serious read on the matter, then the book by the Boston Globe reporters on the topic is an option. This book is like an impulse buy in the check out line. I wish I put it down before I rang out."
1,Re-hash of old hash,"While the hype leaves many to believe that there will be revelations in this book, much of it is re-cycled from Carr's columns he writes for a Boston daily. Certain stories are just that, the legends of urban life in South Boston.Save your money, this will be at the buck a book store soon."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"This is a must-buy for anyone who has seen this show on Spike TV and thought it was even remotely funny.There are an astonishing number of episodes in this two season set, so you are getting a lot of air time for your money because you're getting seasons one and two together instead of buying them individually.This is a great DVD set to have, especially for parties where everyone wants to watch something funny."
4,Hilarious,Good to pop in on a day that you are just feeling down. You won't be able to contain yourself.
1,Great show ruined by gonzos!,"Takeshi's Castle is a brilliantly funny Japanese game show. MXC is a total waste of space with its inane dialogue dubbed in and frequent repetition of elements. Bizarrely, they don't even show the entire program! The ONLY reason to buy these DVDs is to get the two full-length episodes in the original Japanese. They have English subtitles, but even without them the original episodes are vastly superior to the mangled versions provided by MXC."
1,they won't stay in your ears,this things are terrible they just won't stay in your ears.i got a heat rash in my ears just for me to keep them on. please don't buy not even if thier 3 cents.
3,Not So Good,"Really the only song I enjoyed on the entire album was ""You're No Good (But I Like It)."" Though they do have decent singing abilities, they're songs all sound similar and unimpressive. To me, anyway."
4,Seeing Outback Australia - the hard way!,"A well written and easy to read tale of the first packhorse trip down the Bicentennial Trail - the spidery path that runs along the spine of Australia. No mean feat, a journey equivalent to Seattle to Mexico City through some of the most remote of Downunder's extensive wilderness. Told with humour and an eye on frailties both equine and human it details the courage and perseverance of a young Sharon Roberts and husband Ken as they confront everything from crocodile infested rainforests to baking waterless plains, while managing a sometimes reluctant but always bold group of horses. But more than a horse story it's a dashing good read, which the armchair traveller and the non-horse enthusiast can enjoy alike. For horse lovers it is a how-to guide to modern packhorse travel. Highly recommended."
5,Great album,I had the original on eight track! So happy to hear these great songs again. Joe is a very under appreciated rock genius!
1,"ancient, complex poetry sure to baffle children","I love poetry, I'm a huge fan of the Everyman's Series, and the prospect of an Everyman's book of poetry for children may have set my expectations too high. Another reviewer notes that some of the poems may be difficult for children, and I second that. Few rhyme. Now, whatever your stance on rhymes and poetry, I think most folks who know children will agree that rhyming is key. To a child, it's what makes a poem a poem. And for the most part, these poems don't rhyme, and are sure to baffle the young, would-be poetry fan. Aside from that, the majority were written more than a century ago, and the wordage is awkward to a young modern child's ears.A children's poetry anthology can be many things, but a young reader ought to be able to hole up in a corner somewhere and read, understand, follow, be delighted and tickled now and then, and generally come to realize that hey--I like poetry! This book won't pull that off."
5,Exotic Observations,"For the most part I much prefer Nin's diaries to her novels. But I rated this five stars because she is never less than great. Nin disdains all writing technique, scenes, plot, but she's great on characterization and wonderful sensual descriptions of her settings. She has a rep as a writer of erotica, and that rep is well deserved, but there is little of that here. What's really fun is to read her diaries from the same period and setting, so you can see what this was based on. If you love her, and I do, you love her better than anybody. She's just great."
4,"I didn't get it, but that's okay","I did not receive my product, through no fault of the seller. I gave this review 4 stars because the seller was very helpful, and there was no delay in getting my refund."
1,Disappointed,"When I read this product description, and when I read the instructions after receiving the product, I thought this was a great idea. Unfortunately, this product proved to be a waste of time and money for me.1. The lens covering material was relatively small. 3 x 4 inch. I say relatively because if you have a large taillight lens as I do and many newer vehicles do then tee size may be too small for you repair needs. In my case, the crack I was repairing extended beyond the covering material.2. The clear epoxy was mixed according to the instruction. However, when brushed over the repair material, it was thick leaving brush marks and then when dry was cloudy rather than clear.End result, I need to figure a way to remove the application without damaging the lens and try another product, or spend all those big bucks and buy a replacement taillight (which was the reason for seeking a repair system in the first place)."
3,Okay,I had seen one of these in a store a couple of years ago and really liked it.I probably should have returned this one. It appeared to be used and all of the music sheets did not work.I decided to keep it because it is fun and because it was so much trouble to return
1,Utter Rubbish,"This book is utter rubbish. It is carelessy written, its arguments are logically shaky to say the least, and it contains glaring factual errors.I was all the more disappointed because I had previously read Postman's excellent book ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"". Furthermore, Postman's topic in ""Technopoly"" is a serious one and deserves a serious and lucid treatment which, alas, it does not get here.As I read this book I became more and more exasperated by its shoddy thinking, but the ""last straw"" which made me bang the book shut in disgust was Postman's statement that a Turing Machine is a computer which can pass a Turing Test."
2,Mr Ramble,I also had to read this book for a college class. I find postman to be a true rambler. I rolled my eyes several times and procrastinated considerably during the reading of this book. I still come away from this book thinking well what it wrong with being a technopoly? Perhaps it's our destiny? So be it.
5,Brilliant and provocative,"Writer/Director Spike Lee does a masterful job of making a compelling, provocative and artistically groundbreaking film. The plot revolves around surly pizza-delivery-guy Mooky. Mooky exists in two words with one foot in the white-owned business world of sal's pizza and the other in the almost entirely black neighborhood of bed Stuy. In the end, he must make a choice between the two worlds. The beauty of the film is that it is not clear if Mooky ends up feeling he has done the right thing - and we are not sure either. It is the crime of the century that AFI left this off of their top 100 films of the century. Racist AFI - for shame!!!"
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I didn't understand the first hour and a half of Do The Right Thing, but things get serious and cleared up in a heartbeat. This controversial film is about no matter how well we know each other, there is still racial tension living right under the surface. All it takes is some pointless argument about a picture on the wall or a radio being played too loudly, for racism to rear it's ugly head on both sides. Then what happens? People are dead, businesses are ruined, and communities are rioting. Over what? The argument is but a mere spark, racism is the issue. Had the argument been between two black men, instead of a white man and a black man, things would have turned out much differently. That's the point of this film, very wisely and overlooked, Spike Lee is saying who cares what color the person is, step up and do the right thing in every situation. It's a message we should all take to heart."
5,FIGHT THE POWER!!! <3,Another Spike Lee!! Looks Awesome in Blu-ray sounds Great in surround sound too! You Can't go wrong if you're a fan of spike lee!
5,No one does the right thing,"This is a stone classic that explores the dynamic of race relations, finally, inevitably, exploding into an incident quite like real life in New York. Lee makes Bed-Stuy look almost inviting here, shooting his sets in a golden reddish glow, and the frayed brownstone apartments in colorful hues, all against a classic hiphop soundtrack. Moments when real humans would have exploded are made to seem a little unreal here when only heated words are exchanged, but not blows. The Italian pizza shop owners are quite realistic, even if their shop is way more quaint and clean that it would probably be in real life. This is a stylized version of reality. The late 80s haircuts are a hoot, as are the boomboxes, pay phones and Flashdance clothing styles. When Mooky turns on his employer and tosses a trash can through the window during a riot is the pivotal moment in the film. Was this the right thing to do? That's the question. There is more than one answer. Watch."
3,useful,It focuses on strip built more than stitch-and-glued but stilll had a lot of useful information. Tons of information and good ideas for those building the strip type of boats.
1,Is really for kids ?,"When you pick up this book for your child, think twice. Do you really want to teach your child that bulgarians are different people the way the children in Afghanistan are taught about americans? That is not an innocent book the way some people here try to present it. I am a bulgarian and it is clear for me that the book was written by a woman who hates her own country - the communists were teaching hate in Bulgaria some time ago and some people can not go over what they were taught when they were children."
1,Gypsies are not Bulgarians?,"Whoever made this book is just as simple imbecile. On the front covert there are 3 gypsy kids. But they are not Bulgarians!!! There is no such thing as Gypsy culture as well! Especially in Bulgaria...!Bulgaria has a lot more to show but obviously the author is coming from the holes he is writing about. If this person took the pleasure to find just one simple guide tour will find at least 20 curious and valuable sights. Art, music, poetry, science, culture, etc, etc.With thousands of years of existence Bulgaria is more then what is written in this booklet.Don't buy it!"
3,Bulgaria,"This book is part of a series on the cultures of the world. It is like reading an extended encyclopedia entry on the country portrayed. This book glosses over geography, history, government, economy, and social issues.The history section is weak and unimpressive. There is so much history that has to be omitted because the section is limited to 8-10 pages and accompanied by photographs. You also do not get much of an idea of what life in the country is really like. Generalized statements like ""the people of Bulgaria do . . . "" Really. They all do this? This is like saying the people of Minnesota all play hockey. No we don't.This book is meant for grade school children so the rougher aspects of history and the economy are sanitized. If your schoolchild has a report due on a country, this book gives the necessary overview. But there is so much more to Bulgaria than this boook alludes to."
4,Hard.,"The video is a little old (TT bikes age quickly) and the music is not for listening to off the bike, but this is a great workout that is hard to finish. The top triathletes featured are having a hard time so we mortals will also find it difficult!"
5,EVERYONE should have this,"I still have my 1st edition hardcover of this wonderful book. Quite simply, this is the funniest, most human and relevant book I've ever read. Mr. Fulghum is easily one of the great essayists of all time, and certainly of modern times, and is filled with great observations of simple things encountered by Mr. Fulhgum's during his ongoing wonderings and adventures. When people are born into this world a copy of this book should come with the baby blanket and bottles, in a plain brown wrapper, with a tag on it that says, ""Open This When You Turn 40... or 30""."
1,For people who rarely read.,I don't think I can recommend this to anyone. It reads like a grade-school diary.
1,The Bible of the Modern Liberal ...the moral imperative of indiscrimativeness,"Now I believe that what you say is the undisputed truth , but I have to see thing my own way just to keep me in my youth ... the Uberkids of the 60's who brought in the dumbing down of education and society created a society based on this template. The rules laid down in this book have created the modern democratic party, the moral standards by which the modern liberal cannot discriminate were learned in kindergarten and carried through into their adult lives in order that all human history is evil and to eliminate the evil in society we must eliminate everything that is good. As John Lennon said ""Imagine all the people, living for today"" ... and the modern liberal does"
4,Cute!,"Adorable! I mean, with a title like that, how could I NOT get this book? Even though some of the stories didn't apply to me, they were still great to read, and there were tons that did apply and just gave me that warm happy feeling. Everyone should read this book, this is what true inspiration is :D One thing though, it seems that at the beginning, there was some of the Kindergarten-ness, but then, it lost it. What happened? Those were my favorite parts, the connections, and then they died and the book lost a lot of its charm. Sadness. Still, cool read, I'm probably going to post it back for swapping so someone else can enjoy it, too!"
4,Tremendo...,"Despues de lanzar la bomba de Bocanada, el Sr. Cerati continua madurando musicalmente. En particular, Siempre Es Hoy es un albumdefinido mayormente en secciones ritmicas de Hip-Hop y buenos arreglos de guitarras. Pero el gancho de este disco es sin duda el nivel de produccion que lo hace muy placentero de escuchar. Lo recomiendo a todos los que han seguido la trayectoria de este musico."
2,frio y vulgarmente superficial,"Un disco que cansa despues de escucharlo un par de veces. Perdon por criticarlo tan severamente. Soy fanatico del rock en español. Los discos de Cerati siempre me han gustado. La letra, las imagenes, su voz. Todo. Pero este disco no me convenció. Está tan inclinado al pop que aburre. Espero que el próximo disco tenga más colmillo."
3,"BUENO, PERO ALGO ABURRIDO Y SUPERFICIAL","GUSTAVO CERATI ESTA ENTRANDO EN UNA ESPECIE DE ESTANQUE, LUEGO DE SU VIAJE POR BOCANADA Y 11 EPISODIOS, ESTE ARGENTINO NECESITABA OTRA PERSPECTIVA. ENTIENDO QUE CHARLY Y ZETA DEBEN REAPARECER EN SU VIDA YA QUE HA QUEDADO ESTABLECIDA LA SUPERIORIDAD DE SODA POR MUCHO.CREANME NO ES CUESTION DE CAPRICHO, LAS CANCIONES EN GENERAL CARECEN DE PASION, CONTENIDO, ENTUSIASMO, ETC. CREO QUE SE LE PERDIO EL CAMINO, ESTA HACIENDO DISCOS POR CUMPLIR Y ASI LAS COSAS NO SALEN DEL TODO BIEN."
3,"Ok, but not the best",Highlights:3. Bye Bye Bye *NSYNC4. Around the World (La La La La La) ATC6. Independent Women Part I Destiny's Child13.Yellow Coldplay18. Beautiful Day U2
2,Not worth buying,"I've had this ablum since summer '01, and and don't recommend buying this cd. The songs are ok, but, they get old after a while. You don't hear anything that is worth purchasing. However, If you don't want to buy the full ablums of some of the artists than you probably should get it."
5,One of the worlds greatest albums ever,I really liked this album. I also have Now 4 and Now 5.Out of all the CD's in the this world the Now CD's are some of the best.
2,INSULTING!,"First up,the only reason I gave it a 2 is because it actually has some good songs near the end. Secondly what an insult to bands like U2,Coldplay and Fuel who have been put on the same cd as Britney Spears,ATC and N'Sync. Unlike the others they can sell their own albums and don't need to be put on a teeny-bopper cd to be heard. Plus they actually write their own music and aren't one hit wonders.I have no respect for the other ""products"" and they should be on a totally seperate cd."
4,Not the best Now cd,"It is weird how they mix such totally different artists. I prefer the Pop music (NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, etc.),and I don't really like the ""rap/R&B"" on the cd. Other than that, I love the cd! Warning: there are a few lyrics on the cd that parents may not enjoy (ex: Shaggy - It wasn't me)!"
3,"So-So Documentary, Good Concert Scenes.","The documentary portion is nothing to write home about. Just a quick history of Kissin and his childhood. We also see a gentle interview where Kissin plays some of his original compositions. His performance at the prom is shown. A chopin heavy program, but who's complaining? He really makes the pieces look effortless. However the pieces are not shown in their entirety, but just in large fragments. This movie is definately renting if your local video store carries it. His performance of the 10th Transcendental Etude by Liszt is just unbelievable. In fact, he should release a video where he perfroms the entire set of 12 transcendental etudes."
1,Mr Kissins playing is nothing but emty,"I visited a concert with mr Kissin in Stockholm a few years ago. I could barely stay awake. I then realized that popularity has nothing to do with emotionall strenght or depth, only with the superficial that stupid people are able to feel. The crowd gave their applause because of his trancendental fingermovements, and they clapped their hands because of his reputation. When the concert was over, a man shouted ""Bravvoooo"" just because he wanted to be the fist one to celebrate the star, and the herd followed him. The old lady beside me that had slept during the hall consert instantly flew up and shouted, because she obviously wanted to take part in something that was regarded as hip within the""cultural elite"". This movie is pretty much an exampel of that. It's a circus and has nothing to do with the possibilities of the classical music."
1,Doesn't work well,"Shuffler Is inexpensive and that's the only good thing about it. You get what you pay for. Works some of the time, with limited cards in it. Usually doesn't shuffle both sides, ONLY ONE! What good is that?"
2,Bicycle brand 1-2 deck card shuffler,"Never having seen a card deck shuffler before, I was disappointed that theseBicycle 1-2 Deck Card Shufflerrequire lots of hands-on ""help"" while the little spinner pulls the cards in. Sometimes they go in chunks so we have to shuffle many times. I was greatly disappointed that 1 of the 3 identical shufflers that I purchased doesn't work at all and has to be returned."
2,Horrible sound,"Good idea, but definitely this needs to be improve. The sound it makes is horrible. You cannot even talk when the shuffler is running"
1,It sucks don't buy it,Don't buy this product it sucks it can't even handle a half of a deck it is just a big waste of money i would not recommend it to anybody.
2,Not Loud Enough...,I tried these with my Creative Zen Sleek Photo MP3 player in a 3/4 JHC helmet and they do not get loud enuff to hear adequately standing in the driveway never mind on the road. The rated impedance seems low enough maybe the drivers are inefficient/lack sensitivity. I tried plugging them into the headphone output of my Yamaha YST 2.1 computer speakers and with the volume knob cranked up they do get loud and sound pretty good. Most portable devices probably will not have sufficient output to drive them properly for their intended use.
2,Not Loud Enough,"I like the size and ease of placement in the helmet. However, I can hardly hear it when riding. I dont even have that loud of a motorcycle (Ducati ST4S). Its more of a back ground music than anything."
3,Mediocre Effort,"I find that 40K fiction tends to be hit or miss depending on the skills of the author in question. Dan Abnett is by far the best of their stable.This book felt like a short story that had been padded up to novel length with a thesaurus and a good deal of duplicate exposition. The author frequently ""tells"" rather than ""shows"" and the characters tend to be pretty thin - those that are ""evil"" are blatantly so, and those that are ""good"" tend to be conflicted and do a great deal of soul searching.Not being an expert on the Blood Angels, I can't comment on the accuracy of the author's representation, but judging from his liberty with other pieces of canon (such as some psyker elements) I wouldn't be surprised if there were fudges made there as well.If you're a Blood Angel fan, or simply must keep up on GW's storyline for the 40K universe, then you'll most likely read this, but for the rest of us, don't bother."
1,Very disappointing,"I cannot for the life of me understand all the 5-star reviews.Nor can I understand who this book is aimed at:For the beginner it provides just enough knowledge to be dangerous. Sweeping generalisations and banal observations without any concrete 'how to' advice. For example - sure, we should always employ money management, but what systems? - not one is suggested!!! There are far, far better books out there (check out Alexander Elder or Marcel Link for example).For the experienced trader, there is nothing new here.I read this cover to cover in a couple of hours and learned absolutely nothing new. Sorry, but it is going back."
4,The Excellent Series Continues...,"This is a follow-up book to Dark Prince and if you like romance and vampires, this is the book for you. The begining was very interesting and it was nice to see a continuation of previous characters. The main characters, Shea and Jacques, had good chemistry and the action did not overwhelm the love story. It was also quite funny in places. I am looking forward to the next book."
3,Not bad for a cheap air hose.,Not a bad product for the price. Tends to kink and tangle easily. Nice and flexible. Light weight makes it easy to drag around behind a nail gun.
4,Pretty Good for the Money,"This hose is a pretty good deal compared to heavier rubber hoses. It is very light and durable. The only downsides are that it can kink easier than a rubber hose, and has a fairly stubborn memory, making roll-up difficult.Pros-Low price-Very light-DurableCons-Can Kink-Stubborn memory"
3,"Hey, Hey It's A Monkey!","Kong's back, and the only reason I purchased this is because my young son loves the original. You will cringe at some of the scenes, Kong and his lady love actually SMILE! You can tell it's two adults dressed up in monkey suits!!!!Cute for kids though, but I doubt adults would enjoy it. Sad ending too, so prepare the kiddos."
3,"Not as bad as the reputation, but don't expect too much","This is just a no-brainer movie meant to entertain. YES, the FX are pretty bad. YES, the plot is something that a monkey with a typewriter could do. SURE, the acting reeks and the swearing and sex scene and gut-splattering violence are exatterated. It's not even close to the original King Kong, but it's a fun movie anyway."
2,King Kong lives,So they decided to bring King kong 1976 back and it kinda wasnt a very good idea this was a sad sequal King kong falls in love with his own kind and has a baby but kong only knows his son for a few seconds then dies.Give this movie a shot.
3,Probably works but looks too difficult,"This book gives instructions on how to calculate how slow or fast your metabolism really is, by following a 1,000 calorie per day diet for 28 days and writing down any deviation from that, then doing some complicated formulas. I just think that 1,000 calories per day is too low for me, and could slow my metabolism down more than it already is, with the risk of losing muscle mass."
2,Good Luck,"I am on my fourth GD-70X unit in a year. This company is terrible, as are their customer service policies. Out of the year I've owned the unit(s) I've only had a working one for about 6 months. When it works, I love it.This time they are charging me $99.00 for labor to fix my unit...the only thing is...they're not performing any labor. I am being sent a GD-701 as a replacement. When I pointed out that there was no labor actually being performed for my labor charge, the rep said, ""I know sir, I agree it's stupid. If you want we can fix your GD-70X and send that back to you."" -Uh No thanks!When I get the replacement, I'm going to sell it on ebay and go buy a Garmin or Magellan at Best Buy. I never want to spend another hour of my life on the phone with Global-Navigation's lame excuse for customer service and ""tech support"""
4,Re-enchanting!,"I really enjoyed this book. It put a new light on some old favorites. Wickedly, wild women! Especially liked Snow Night and Ala Dean and the Wonderful Lamp. Of course it did put to ease any doubt about Barbidol. All in all a great bedside book."
1,This Gourmet Settings Flatware Rusts Be aware that the Materials Used are not 18/10 nor 18/8 Because Stainless does not Rust.,"This Gourmet Settings Flatware Rusts Be aware that the Materials Used are not 18/10 nor 18/8, Because Stainless does not Rust."
4,Heavy and durable,"I've been using the Gourmet Settings flatware for over two years now. I like the heaviness of the pieces. I have yet to bend or break any of them. The only issue I have is some of the knives have developed small rust spots after being in the dishwasher. These spots are only on the knives, I have had no issue with any of the other pieces. A scratch pad or steel wool has taken care of this and is a non issue for me."
4,Love this flatware,"I love this flatware pattern. It's simplicity adds class to any table setting, and yet still functions as everyday use. This issturdy and classic. Versitile, as it will go with most any dinnerware from everyday casual to fine china setting. Now if I could find the serving pieces to go with it I'll be in heaven!"
2,Don't bother,"""My Secret Garden"" was far better. Some of the stories read far more like male fantasies of what ""dirty girl"" fantasies might be. Somehow, this book just left me cold & bored."
3,not a fun read,"I love Stravinsky's music but this biography has so much minutely detailed information about Stravinsky's works that it was very difficult for the author to maintain the narrative's flow. Somebody warned me of this but the same was said about Richard Buckle's biography of Diaghilev (which I think is one of the greatest biographies ever written) so I went ahead and started reading this book anyway. I quit about half way through. Like a dictionary, this book may be good to consult if you want a particular piece of information about Stravinsky but reading it from cover to cover is a hard slog."
4,A comfortable book,"Reading Whitey Ford's ""Few and Chosen"" is like listening to him....soft-spoken with a twinkle in his eye. This is a book you can pick up and put down and not miss much. The stories are usually short (sometimes too short) and the anecdotes are just about what you'd expect to hear from ""The Chairman of the Board"".I appreciate Whitey Ford's honesty with regard to players who preceded him. He doesn't comment on them much because he didn't see them play. Still, he gives what impressions he has. After reading Tim McCarver's disappointing and overworked ""Perfect Season"" several years ago, ""Few and Chosen"" is like a breath of fresh air.There are a few new facts (new to me, anyway) that come out in his book, like the small numbers of home runs hit by players before Babe Ruth. Things of this nature help to make baseball more interesting to many of us.Whitey Ford pitched the first baseball game I ever saw in 1963. I'm glad he's still around to pass on his observations to us."
4,Job well done by Whitey,"Whitey Ford's new book,with former Yankee beat writer Phil Pepe,is a winner.Picking the top 5 players at each position might seem easy,until you sit and think about the long line of great players the Yankees have fielded.Not that theres a lot of controversy,but a couple of Ford's picks might surprise you.Its an enjoyable rehash for older fans with mostly familiar anecdotes.It's also an education for younger fans who might not be familiar with past Yankee greats.And the cover photo is indeed a Yankee cap,worn by them in the early 20's,although I feel that the navy blue cap with the white interlocking NY would have been a better choice."
5,THE DIRTY DIRTY SOUTH,Fly is bumping. He has been bumping for a long long time along with Gangsta Blac. It is about time these guys came up. The most thing I like about Fly is that he can flow all day long without cursing either little or none; Which is good for the young people listening. Keep up the good work and dont't give up.
5,Untold Secrets of Cinema Sound,"Mr. Yewdall, the author, puts his long time experience into this book. Avoiding pitfalls with producers to working with budgetary constraints while producing academy award winning sound is probably the main emphasis of this book. The CD that comes with it is quite valuable, containing sample audio clips to demonstrates the author's points at various times. This book will save you atleast 2 years of experience in motion picture sound. It's worth every penny."
4,Fascinating story of a complex woman!,"Loved this film! Dana Delany was excellent as Margaret Sanger a woman who faced great challenges. Great story about a fascinating woman, made me want to cry and punch a few stubborn stupid men in the ovaries!! Loved Henry Czerny too as the somewhat supportive husband. Great cast all round. Read the story of Margaret Sanger very interesting woman with a fascinating life story."
5,An entertaining who's-who of top Texas writers.,"Some 39 of the best Texas writers get a chance to tell about themselves with essays about favorite meals, stories about growing up, and recipes that have special meaning. It's a wonderful way to showcase some of the best writers in the country -- letting us have a slice of their personal life. Entertaining stories from Kinky Friedman, Liz Carpenter, Naomi Nye, Robert and Jean Flynn, Molly Ivins and many others. And some of these folks can actually cook. The author, Deborah Douglas, writes witty, insightful essays as introductions to each of the writers' pieces. There's even a web site for the book."
3,"Good guide to timeless style, with one or two howlers","'Gentleman' is a good overview for any man wishing to emulate the components of a (British) gentleman's style. His suits, shirts, trousers, jackets, leisure gear, grooming products and where to buy them. There is even a section on the ideal gentleman's breakfast. Generally the information is accessible and well presented, with detailed colour photography throughout. The author's knowledge is clearly haphazard however. There are some hillarious mistakes on several pages. For example he advises that gentleman golfers playing in bad weather should wear a Barbour jacket - come on!"
3,omphilosophizing by a master,"Be aware that this is an early journal and is similar to Merton's magnum opus, ""The Seven Storey Mountain."" His early works---his ""callow youth"" phase---I find irritatingly immature and egotistic. This from a monk who is supposed to lose his ego in the love and service of God but begs God in his prayers to make him a saint.Fear not, even Merton grows up after 25+ years at Gethsemani Abbey. The life of a monk is so good that even someone so ""hung up on himself"" can eventually start making sense in his writings. This early journal does give a good picture of what the monastic life (Cistercian) was all about. One can see the hope for an improved future for this man."
4,Somber but still rocking strong.,"When I bought Warren Zevon's last album ""Wind"" I was afraid tolisten to it for a day - I did not want to feel pity and haveto make myself like the album just because it may be Warren'slast. So I am glad to say it is as strong as any other Warren's work.I have a lot of respect for the final product after watching VH1documentary about making of that album. Warren was at times veryexhausted, running out of breath etc. Nevertheless - the albumdoes not show it very much and generally rocks nicely although inmore somber mood then other WZ albums. Warren's voice may not beas strong as it used to be but songwriting and delivery are stillfirst class.All the supporting musicians (Springsteen,Petty, Cooder and manyothers) and nicely understated production give the album thequality of real labor of love. It is a good album and I am gladWarren had a chance to make it so. No matter what happens we willkeep him in our hearts. And not just for a while."
4,A moving goodbye,"A document of courage, artistry, and intimacy. I've enjoyed every album Zevon has released through his career. This one is a worthy coda. Keep Me In Your Heart is a song that will haunt and comfort this Zevon fan as long as I live."
2,The Wind,"It's a shame that this album didn't standup to the prior song collections from Warren. There are only a handful of tunes that in my eyes that even make the cut. - Good rendition of ""Knockin on Heavens Door"". That's about it.Much like the quality of Johnny Cash's last projects..I rather remember Warren for songs like ""play it all night long"" or ""excitable boy"""
1,Only 2 good songs...,"This album is horrible. I have to laugh at some of the comments about it... almost all of the album could have been written by a 16 year old '70's high school head... and just what we needed... another ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" remake... nuts. Dirty Life & Times & Keep Me in Your Heart are great tunes... every else is garbage... waste of money... one reviewer even said this will go down as one of the finest albums ever made... (only if its the only album you have ever heard)"
2,Meh.,Perhaps it will grow on me over time but the one word Simpsonian title of this review pretty much sums it up. Sorry Warrren.
4,God Bless you Warren.,"""The Wind"" #12 (2003).12th and final album of his illustrious career. Weak, but still with a sense of humor, Warren bravely did one last album. My biggest question was where did all of these fans come from?, after 20 years of declining sales? Warren was dying, but this album is chuckful of good material, the highlights include, ""Dirty Life And Times"", the rocking' ""Disorder In The House"", with Bruce Springsteen on background vocals and a great guitar solo by Bruce. The Dylan tune ""Knocking On Heaven's Door"", the first single. ""Numb As A Statue"", ""She's Too Good For Me"", ""The Rest Of The Night"", the blues of ""Rub Me Raw"" and the prettiest final song ""Keep Me In Your Heart"", Warren wore his emotions on his sleeve. This guy had a great recording career, too bad a lot of people didn't enjoy the whole ride. God bless you Warren."
4,Recipes seem repetitive and distract from the theme,"""Like Water for Chocolate,"" by Laura Esquivel, is a book that helds every element of life within its pages. The reader is able to experience love, tragedy, sadness, happiness, and all other emotions that are in-between. It is a story told by the great niece of the main character, Tita De La Garza. By using recipes and remedies, Esquivel is able to portray the life of young gilr in love, and the effects that her family had on her quest of marrying her true love.The only part of the book that would need work would be the theme development. At first the recipes were great, they were useful in allowing Esquivel to bind the importance of emotional affects people have on other people. All the recipes did start to become repetative. It would have been more"
3,Like Water For Chocolate,"Laura Esquirel has proven to be an exceptional writer after reading this book. This book is of nothing I have ever read before. Some of the scenes truely baffle me. For instance, at the beginning it says Tita, one of the main characters, was washed into the world by her own tears. The labor was brought on early becausae her mother was peeling onions in the kitchen which made her cry. Another aspect about this book is that at the beginning of each chapter it gives you a recipe. I have never even heard of the recipes in this book before. It tells you how to make each one at the beginning of each chapter which leads into the story. So basically this book is based on a kitchen and cooking with the lives of three daughters, a mother, and a cook and how love can hurt so much. If you like romance books I'm sure you are going to love Like Water for Chocolate."
3,Try the original,"Laura Esquivel's novel is much better when read in Spanish. There are many small changes in the English that make this book far more dull than it is in Spanish. I would recommend renting the movie instead, as the subtitles are much closer to the original than is the novel translation."
5,A Feast For The Eyes And Your Mouth,"When I heard about the novel, I was notified that it was an motion picture from Miramax. The film was recommened by an aquaintance. I heard alot of good stuff about the film which he told me details of the film, which was a must-see. Then, when I was reading the article of the New York Times best seller book list. I find out on the titie Like Water For Chocolate was on the list, which even fancinates me more. So when I went to the libary to read this novel. I was head- ing to a trip of rich emotions and love, even the delicious recipes like my favorite, quail in rose petal sauce. I like stories taking back the days of the 19th century. The most impressive character was Tita who is the heroine in the novel (as well as the film cleverly written by Esquevel herslf) I recommened this novel which I seen the enchanting movie for my friends and family years to come."
4,"A novel about monthly recipes, romances, and home remedies","Like water for chocolate is a book full of recipes that arebased on traditional Mexican recipes and has not been testedby the publisher. This novel is not only about the recipes,preparation, or ingredients that make it an enjoyable bookto read. It is also about love, sadness, a family who experiences romance, the disappointments of being together, and keeping the special recipes alive from generation to generation. This book is not like any other book I have read. Water for chocolate is full of surprises. The story lags and there is always something happening by the next month. I recommend this novel to everyone who's interested.This book will make you smile and cry. It's a book to remember and to share with a friend."
4,This book is really good!,"I think ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is a great book especially those who love to cook.Not only is this a great story but also there are plenty of recipes too.It is a love story with many events of magical realism.The main characters are Tita and Pedro who stuggle to show their love.The magical events really enhance this story.Also, the use of metaphors and similes makes it easy understand this rather complex plot.Once again,this is a great book and is a must read."
2,I read this book for school,"I read Like Water for Chocolate for my summer reading project for school. I felt that I could not really get into it and see myself as the characters. That is mostly because, to me the setting was too fake. Maybe it is the way it was done a long time ago, but I have never heard of someone marrying somone's sister to be closer to them. It may also be the fact that I am a guy but to me this book was just boring."
1,Waste of Time,"I recently read Like Water For Chocolate by Laura Esquivel. I didnt like the novel at all. I thought that they wasted 241 pages of valuable paper to print this horrible book. I didnt like it because it had no point. It was boring to read. The chapters didnt connevt to each other at all and the author also didnt do a good job of explaining the time difference between chapters. I also didnt like Pedro, a character in the novel. I think he is a hoorible person. He has no morals or ethics. He makes the book seem like something of Jerry Springer. To anyone who likes boring, no point, horrible books than read Like Water For Chocolate."
4,A romantic and heart breaking novel.,"The novel ""Like Water For Chocolate"", was a very interesting novel that really knows how to keep the readers attention. This novel would be a good book to read for those people that are into romance. The poor Tita, who goes through a lot of suffering just because she is the youngest one in her family, could sometimes make you cry and at the same time could make you angry as she describes the rest of the characters' personality in the story. This book is full of different traditions that our ancestors probably followed, romance scenes that one could picture, and full of different types of Love. I think that this book should be read by everyone, no matter what sex he or she is. It is a novel that could keep you reading."
5,A wonderful love story; visually exceptional!,"I read this book when it was first published, have since re-read it and will undoubtedly read it a third time! For me, the characters came alive immediately! I experienced frustration with Tita's ""bondage"" and anger at her mother and sister. Some of the more humorous scenes are without peer. I was intrigued by the use of food preparation as an emotional outlet. The characters, humor and emotions are timeless. I have recommended the book to my four daughters and certain friends whom I thought would appreciate the unique theme and plot. It is one of my all-time favorites along with ""The Stories of Eva Luna"" and ""Love in the Time of Cholera."""
4,Deliciously juicy,"""Like Water for Chocolate"" was a romantic food novel that I was required to read for my college English class. The book was very realistic at times but would have certain elements playfully exaggerated with a fantasy twist. It was unique how the Laura Esquivel incorporated recipes to go with chapters of the book. This novel was written beautifully and will leave you in a half fantasy world of love surrounded in a deep aura of Spanish foods. It truly transports you to another world. Recommended for the romantic. :)"
3,Enjoyably simple,"This is good story and a very easy read. I probably should have read it in Spanish because the simple sentence structures and language were a little boring at times. But, it was a romantic and enjoyable story that made me crave whipped chocolate for days!"
4,"Food, life, and Love","This novel has an interesting flavor and perspective, being translatedfrom the Mexican bestseller. The blending of recipes at the beginningof each chapter, and the plot developments relating to thoserecipes reflect the tight integration of cuisine into theshowcased family's life. Also captivating is Esquivel'sseamless blending of realistic insight into her protagonist'sthoughts with segues into moments of outright fantasy at thehigh point of the novel. The novel is beautifully writtenwith a wonderful atmosphere. The story of unrequited love tugsa bit at your heartstrings, but didn't pull me over the top,maybe because I personally couldn't relate as much to thedecisions made by the characters. The story works on manyother levels besides the romance aspect, however, and shouldoffer a good soft-hearted read."
3,Like Water for Chocolate,"Like Water For Chocolate is a story based on a forbidden romance between the main character Tita and her love Pedro. The story tells of recipes that Tita prepares and how the family feels different emotions while eating. The book was split in months starting from her teenage years to late in her life telling of all the events through the years. I had never read a magical realism book and found it to be very entertaining. The book was never boring, but did have its share of strange parts. If you like magical realism I would recommend this book for you."
4,a tragic life told in food,"food has always been a favorite metaphor for writers (and moviemakers). we have to eat to survive. in Like Water for Chocolate, food is the metaphor for the passions of Tita, the youngest of 3 daughters. Forced by her tyranical mother to forsake her true love, Tita watches as he marries her oldest sister. she pours her emotions into the food. in every chapter, her emotions are poured into the food she makes. it is only through her cooking, that Tita can express her feelings. This is a good book about the tyranny of tradition and the liberation of food. i would recmmend this book w/o reservationthe recipes are pretty useless to the modern cook. if you want to concot some of the food mentioned, i would check a mexican cookbook for the modern equivalent."
1,Beethoven Sonatas - Barenboim,Quite a disappointment. Barenboim's Beethoven Piano Concertos are just extraordinary. The sonatas... do not sound like Beethoven
3,The Scholastic Teacher Plan Book,"Great if you are not a teacher that needs to move from room to room. It is too big for packing. But if you have your own classroom and can keep it on your desk, you will love it."
4,Works like a charm,"Good product, i am using 2 of them in P3 NEC laptops. Did not work, however, in some earlier P2 NEC laptops and this was not explained."
4,"Nice, but...","I'd give it four stars if a hostess set was available. I really like this flatware, but even now that hostess sets are available on some of the other settings (like Get Set), I can't get serving pieces for mine. I know people from Gourmet Settings occasionally see messages - even reply to them - so I'm hoping maybe they'll take this to heart and make serving/hostess sets available for ALL their designs."
5,Concert DVD,This item arrived earlier than committed to by the vendor and as described. I would gladly purchase additional items in the future from this vendor.
5,Insider Look at Homeschooling,"We have a 2.5 year and 10 month old, with hopefully more on the way. Having been formally trained in elementary ed., homeschooling sounded more do-able without all of the bureaucracy or parent-teacher headaches that come with it. I did not have the 'guts' as my oldest would say to do this until I read about the REAL experiences of these other brave mom and dad teams that are providing the best education they knew of for their children. It is also rewarding to hear the recipients of this education program voice their thoughts at times. They (parents) have the same qualms and in some cases mind-set and situation we do, and yet they are making it work!!! How reassuring! Looking at the various schemas used to educate, I found that I leaned more conservatively, while getting a fair look at other ways of educating. I borrowed this from my library, but I want it for myself as a resource! :) Happy researching!"
1,Not what I needed,"This armband goes along with the otterbox ipod waterproof case. The case is so big and clunky that it renders the armband useless. I might as well strap a ""boom box"" to my arm."
4,Hot manogamy,"As an MFT Intern, dealing with conflict in the bedroom is an area that any therapist dealing with couples should be comfortable discussing. This book gives great guidance on what to say, how to approach it and gives the therapist numerous self-reports (questions could be used to guide discussion in sessions)and homework suggestions to acheive a more fullfilling intimate life. It has just as much to improve communication as technique."
2,Better book to read is PASSION PLAY,"by Felice Dunas. Patricia Love makes some good points when she says that a couple should address their sexual issues LONG BEFORE they decide to get into therapy.Read Dunas's book also. While Dunas' book is very sexually explicit, dealing with the ancient Chinese approach to great sex- yin/yang energy moving - she is very practical she even has a sample monogamy agreement included for couples."
4,This is a great read about the way people think,"This book begins as a simple story set in the 1920s with witchcraft and unicorns in the background, and becomes a mystery as stranger and stranger events follow. This is also a story about people-- and how stories can snowball from a child's tale into a trial. The characters are well painted, you'll be hooked!"
5,This is a very good book to own.,"The Cancer Prevention Diet, by Michio Kushi, outlines the causes and cures for cancer, according to a macrobiotic philosophy. This philosophy, posited on yin-yang (as male-female) is about excess, imbalance (sickness) and balance (health) and how to bring this about in our lives and our diets. It is a wonderful book - very thorough on background, filled with testimonies from cancer survivors, outlining the different types of cancers, and detailing information on menus, cooking, healing tactics, etc. Even if one does not fully embrace the macrobiotic philosophy, I think this is a wonderful book, and gives sound advice on healthy eating and lots of other things associated with cancer. I highly recommend this book as a reference book for health, and a book of hope."
5,Utterly Smashing,This soundtrack is absolutely amazing! It has a variety of styles in music from electronic to pop. I really like this album because it reminds of my childhood (which is okay)and all the things that I've done and learned from.
1,Expensive Transfer Belt Failed after light use - Awful Printer,"My wife and I bought the Minolta 2350-EN Color Laser Printer 5 years ago and had about two years of good results followed by repeated nightmares culminating in a $360 repair bill that leaves us with a boat anchor. In all that time we could not have printed more than 4,000 pages in total, enough to use up one set of cartridges. During the past 3 years we have had spotty prints, many times unusable finally culminating in a seized up gearbox ($280) and horrible problems with the transfer belt ""consumable"" ($330 new) which is advertised to last for 50,000+ impressions.Needless to say we are not going to throw good money after bad an will NOT be replacing this piece of junk with another Konica Minolta printer product.... YMMV."
5,i don't get it but...,sometimes u know something is brilliant even if u don't quite understand it. that's the case here. waiting for someone to explain it to me.
3,Cursive Suppliment,"I was a little disappointed when I opened the book towards the end. The child is supposed to write a sentence in cursive, but the example is written in print. I just feel if a child is learning how to write in cursive, they need to have the written example, especially if they are just learning how to write in cursive. I will still use this book, although I will write the sentence out for our children. This would probably be a good one for a 4ht or 5th grader who just needs extra practice."
2,Cursive writing for children,I was disappointed by this book. I expected to see many sentences' examples on each page where the child would imitates the original. I wonder where can I find such book. I have been doing a search for a good cursive writing book for a while.
3,"Not the best, but fair","What happened? Bag of Bones and The Girl who Loved Tom Gordan were great, although the latter's ending was a bit predictable. But, this new one is, well, dull. I'm not staying up at night scared for the characters or for myself. It is well written and it is as another ""novice critic"" said ""a chronicle of the 60's"", a tragic decade many of his readers have only heard about. It's a really good novel, just don't expect to jump out of your skin. If you do, you will probably be let down."
2,Not one of King's better books,"Unlike ""Bag of Bones"" which I couldn't put down. I couldn't wait to finish this one...it was terrible after the first story. The only people who will understand the Vietnam references will be those who experienced it first hand. I was very dissappointed!!"
5,Steve in fine literary form,"King writes great Americana, and this take on the sixties, and the lost innocence of a nation, is touching and wistful.I have come to worry that supernatural horror will come in at the end and muck up a perfectly reasonable book, but here any supernatural events are the magic of childhood, not the monster out of the closet."
2,Forced myself through this one.,"Usually I enjoy Stephen King novels, thrilling, on the edge of your seat reads, some have made me think and come away with a differing thought or perspective than before. This book I had to force myself to read. It took 10 days, which says alot. The stories had some inter conncetion between them, a common point, though I am not sure I know what now. I could not keep up interest in this book. The stories almost seem to be recycled bits from previous stories. King is a stand out writer, one of the best we have today, and I still look forward to his next book. I just hope it is better than Hearts, though I think it would have to be."
3,Fabulous Examination of an Era and its inhabitants,"The First story was obviously the best. Its connection to the Dark Tower series is interesting and I hope we see the characters in it again. The kindly boarder, the use of ""Lord of the Flies"", the cruelty of children are all elements of this intriguing tale. The other shining tale is the one of the college students who become obsessed with Hearts. Anyone who has experienced life in a college dorm knows how easily obsessions begin be they drinking, computer games or whatnot, and lead students far astray from their work. This story is also a beautiful love story and was very touching. The other stories were pretty weak however. Blind Willie was unbearably predictable, boring and farmiliar. Skip it. The final tale tying the threads together was also weak. But the two stories I mentioned were blockbusters!"
4,Hearts In Atlantis,"Quite a bit different from most SK novels. It doesn't depend on a supernatural plot (though obligatory supernatural elements do appear).It's tough to describe why it's so good. On occasion, we have all met strangers from far away who, to our amazement, co-own little pieces of our past. Maybe they went to summer camp with someone who would become your college roomy, or maybe they married your 4th grade sweetheart. It might have made you wonder how many such connections you never quite stumble onto. Hearts in Atlantis is an exploration of that kind of interconnectedness in the lives of three childhood friends who go very separate ways. It's a bittersweet reflection on paths not taken, on what might have changed had we been just a little better or a little wiser.King usually holds my interest, but this is the first time one of his books wouldn't let go after I'd finished it. Very different from the movie, though I enjoyed both."
3,A true fan,"Hey - you have to give S. King a break - he's pumping out a book every 6 months. I gave the review section three stars, but just between you and me; it's only a two on a good day. I love Steven King and I own every one of his books in hard cover. I'm the reason why this guy's making the big bucks, but I have to say that there's a lot of books out there that blow this one away... many of which are mentioned in the first story in this book. If you just finished the Tom Gordon book, then don't worry - it's not half as bad, but if you just finished The Shining, It, or anything written in the 80's, then maybe you should try The Talisman, The Tommyknockers, Insomnia, or the brilliant series of The Green Mile. Sorry Steve..."
4,Definitely worth the read,This is the King of yesteryear. A very tight book- well conceived and very emotionally captivating. The book is divided into the three sections of very different lengths. The first section is terrific. The second section was interesting but I wasn't sure where it was going (not as riveting as Section 1). And then came the tidy little ending- the last section- which pulled all of those little loose ends together adding a poignant twist that'll bring a tear to your eye. A touch of the old supernatural from Mr. King. He knows how to do it right.
1,WARNING - King reads half the book!,"Nowhere on the label does it say Stephen King is reading any of this book. If it did, I would never have bought the CD. The first story is read by a very good reader. The rest is not -- at least so far as I can tell. I listened to King read for 5 more disks and that was all I could stand. I don't know how much of it he actually reads. I feel this was trick labeling of the CD and I will never buy another Stephen King audio book for fear it will not tell the truth about who is reading."
2,I am never buying a Stephen King hardcover again!,"Wait 'til this comes out in paperback-- better yet, get it out from your library. The first ""story""-- ""Low Men in Yellow Coats""-- was the only part of this book worth reading. However, hasn't King been through this territory before (i.e. ""It"")? He'd have done better to develop that ""story"" into a stand-alone novel than to string it with the character studies he places after it."
1,Awful,"Contains every demeaning and ignorant cliche there is about the Vietnam war and those of us who fought there. If you read this thing, please buy ""Stolen Valor"" and ""After Tet"" and read them for some balance.Mr. King, you're cordially invited to come and stay with us as my guest in Cambodia so you can see the results of the abandonment of the people of Sourtheast Asia due to the antiwar protests you find so neat and cool...you should be ashamed of what you have written."
2,I hate to say this... but it definitly could be better...,"The first half of this book is very, very good. I really like King's novels (GET WELL SOON) and have read nearly all of them. I'm proud to say.But this one... I frankly didn't think that there is a need for the entire Hearts thing. A good chuck of the book is dedicated to how addictive this game is to college students. I was once a college student, our game was pool, I understand. I just didn't need to read pages and pages about it. This may be a thing about Vietnam and that's great, but that deserves it's own book.It got to the point where I was frantically scanning for the names of the three kids that were in the first half of the book. I was severly disappointed when they didn't show up again till the end.I heard that the movie rights have been sold to Castle Rock. I really don't think I'm going to spend money to watch a bunch of kids play cards. That is not going to happen.Defeinitly could be better Mr. King."
4,growing with us,"You people who think king should ""give us more of what got you here"" need to grow up! People change and grow they don't stay the same.I just wonder if you people are just kids catching on to king and don't realize how long he has been around.Let him grow up!"
3,"Great Stories, but terrible narration by William Hurt","As any fan of audio-books knows the narration is key to the overall experience delivered by the book - I have heard fair to poor books come alive with the right person narrating. William Hurt is a great actor, but I could not believe the awful job he did narrating portions of this book - it really ruined the portions he read. His ability to read a sentence naturally without staccato interruptions (in the wrong places) made it difficult to listen to. I kept wondering when the producer was going to think...""this is not working out, let's find someone else""Overall I enjoyed the second story ""Hearts in Atlantis"" the best and think this book is another fine piece of work by Steven King. Additionally, King, as always, does a wonderful job of narrating. As with Bag of Bones his style is excellent and well delivered - accents and all. It's just really is nice to hear the author put the emphasis and feeling into the verbal reading too!! What a treat!!"
4,Very Good King Read!,"If you are expecting vintage King, you may be disappointed. However, over the years, it has been exciting for me to see Stephen King's style grow and evolve. Starting with Bag of Bones, King's finger on horror has matured from stock-shock gory to a deep psychological terror. In HIA, King explores some dark little places that nobody likes to go, and does so with incredible insight and sensitivity. Even if you don't like the novel, enjoy it for the pure pleasure of how Mr. King puts words down on a page. With this novel, he has certainly proven he's no longer the ""Big Mac and Fries"" of the literary world."
3,"The first 2 sections were great, but the rest....","The first 2 sections of this book were very, very good. The story-lines & characters were very interesting and intriguing. But the final 3 sections really didn't do anything for me. I guess since King went to the trouble of intertwining the stories, I expected some sort of resolution or closure at the end, which never really came.IMO, King would've been better off making individual books out of the first 2 sections. IMO, some of King's early books were masterpieces, but in recent years, it seems like his books are just thrown together haphazardly, with not enough editing or fine-tuning."
1,the book is lousy,"king couldn't decide whether he wanted the book to be a horror story or maudlin ,rambling tale of life in the sixties. Very boring."
1,A real let down!,"I'm beginning to wonder if King is imitating Bag of Bones' Mike Noonan's technique for writer's block, publishing older books stored for rainy days. In this case, before King knew how to write INTERESTING books. With this book, take King's own advice, ""read the first ten per cent...if it isn't giving more than it's taking by then, put it aside."" After 52 pages you will be reading a different book."
3,"OK, but not his best.","I thought the first story ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" was very good, it did start out slow and left me wondering when it would get moving, it finally did. The rest of the book was boring, so much so that I could not finish it."
2,Awesome beginning - Disappoiting ending!,"Hearts in Atlantis starts out like a true Stephen King novel. Vivid characterizations,intriquing plot and all the supernatural elements that keep us reading till 3am! But what happened to parts 2 - 5. Gone are the horror and suspense to be replaced by two dimensionel charactors and political rhetoric. I felt cheated out of an ending. And though part 1 makes reference(s) to THE DARK TOWER series, I never read those (tried to - but found them plodding and uninteresting!) Did I miss something? Is the real ending somewhere in THOSE books?"
5,My heart is now lost in its pages......,"I've read a lot of other King novels and many have been a disappointment because of their endings. After reading the story ""Hearts in Atlantis"" I can say King has let me live the 60's through his words and I enjoyed every crazy second! I don't think he will write another great piece like this ever again. I've seen a few other reviews that have not been impressed by his work but most of them expected tales of horror. This book is not that at all. The stories are about lost love, lost dreams and lost innocence caused by the experience of the 60's. It will touch your heart and you too will become lost in the pages of this great story."
2,Three Story Pawned Off As One,"Very disappointing. This is really a book of 3 stories VERY loosely linked togather by one or two overlapping characters. The first part of the book is very good and typical King (though the movie did not do it justice!) Unfortunately, the second part is about an entirely new character with a secondary character from the first part as a secondary character in the second part. The third part was about mostly about another secondary character from the first part of the book and some almost unrelated new characters.Confusing? It is as if King had 3 short stories in mind but wanted to write a lengthy book. I felt somewhat deceived. He does, rather weakly, try to tie the parts togather at the very end.Net, net. Borrow the book and read the first part and the last several pages! Sorry to be so hard on a writer I usually love.. but not this time!"
4,An excellent book.,"Even though critics hate him... Even though I have not liked some of his books in the past... Even though this book is long... This book deserves 5 stars. However, there is a good deal of unnecessary bad language so I'm giving it a 4. There are passages in this book which are heartrendingly true. I loved all five stories. Excellent!"
3,Declines after the first novel,"This book is actually two novels and some shorts stories witha common thread. The first novel is an east coast Garrison Keillor with a PSIgrandpa added. The second is a college dorm story from the '60's abouta scholarship student. These two are pretty good, but the short stories except for the end one are dreadful.I think he could have made a great novel of the first one by sticking to actual autobiographical material.As it stands it leaves me, as most of Stephen King's work does,feeling unclean for having read it. Last time Iread one of these I said to myself I wouldn't read anymoreof his trash..."
1,Great Concept -- Poor Execution,"Keyboard is well-designed (small, light) with good key feel, and it's Mac-compatible. But don't get it unless you can tolerate extremely s-l-o-w, inaccurate mouse function. For this price, mouse should work great, and this isn't close yet."
3,Night of the Silver Stars: The Battle of Lang Vei,"A well told story of young men in combat. 1LT Paul Longgrear is featured and the story known to many is that it was that night, The Night of the Silver Stars, that changed Longgrear's life forever. He became a christian. Many soldiers reach out in prayer when they fear for their life. Many promise God many things. Not all manage to follow though and keep the promises made. Paul Longgrear did. The story of young Americans in a conflict that divided this nation. A good story and one well worth the read."
3,Night of the Silver Stars,Too much description or lead to the fight. The first third or so is so boring that I have not finished the book. It isn't written in a way that holds your interest.
5,Great heavenly music!,"I've said it again & again - they have got to do a New Age Concerto w/ 2002, Enya, & the like!This couple is absolutely fantastic!I wonder if there has been the prospect of a physical New Age Community?This music is absolutely Heavenly!It touches the very essence of your Heart & inner core of your Soul."
5,"beautiful, relaxing music","This CD contains some of the most relaxing and beautiful music I've heard...2002 really produces a wonderful listening experience. Also, 2002's ""River of Stars"" is terrific. I highly recommend both CD's."
3,Very technical,"I needed this book for class and for me, assessments are not the most interesting course. This book is very technical, but does have the necessary information to understand assessment and testing in counseling."
3,Too bad.......Palm Oil,"Man! I tried this stuff and it's delicious. However, it has palm oil in it. Not only is palm oil extremely unhealthy, it contributes to the clearcutting of rainforests (See Rainforest Action Network for more info). I am personally committed to NOT buying items with palm oil, so I'm going to try a different brand!"
5,My students like it.,My high school students say this would be a good mini-text. It lays the major points out in a format they read and got a lot from. I'm planning to order several more copies for myvideo production class.
4,Good for learning the 555,"I really understand how the 555 timer works after reading this book. I would have given it another star if the author would have spent some time on showing why he picked the resistor values used. Get it used as it isn;t really worth paying top dollar, but well worth the used price."
5,Scottish Crime Solving,"See my review on ""Taggart - The Knife Trick Collection."" Great long-lasting crime show with Glasgow, Scotland as the police department investigating. Good actors."
2,Kill It Please!,"This horrendous sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever"" ends in one of the WORST production numbers ever filmed. Stallone turned what might have been a potentially interesting story into a dancing ""Rocky"" cliche. Sorry Sly but Broadway dancers are not boxers. The movie looks more ridiculous with those dated 80's fashion; terrible songs courtesy of Stallone's tone deaf brother Frank and the inmortal ""Satan's Alley"" which looks like Conan the Barbarian meets the S&M Cats on Mars! Bad movie lovers enjoy!"
3,BAD AND CHEESY....,"I agree with everyone, this stinks. But it's got John Travolta, and I swear, I can look at him chewing gum for hours and not get bored.The only good part of this movie... when Tony scores his first Broadway triumph and says to his girlfriend, ""you know what I wanna do? I wanna strut!"" He then goes out the side theatre door, music of staylin alive by the bee gees plays and walks out on Times Square. It's same vision we saw six years earlier...Tony walking like he owned the world (via SNF). It's so NY! He's the boy from Brooklyn, who made it.This is the ONLY good scene in the movie. Trust me."
1,Two hours in Purgatory,"Awful early-80s dreck. Everything that was wrong with the popular culture of the time is well represented here, with the possible exception of a soundtrack number or two by Kenny Loggins. I like Saturday Night Fever and I'm not a Travolta-hater, but his ""acting"" here is a God-awful atrocity and the only links to the original picture are the Manero character and the inane ""nice girl digs me but I want the snotty princess""(who just happens to have an upper-class British accent) subplot. ""SNF"" had real magic, but this desiccated, lifeless cash-in is good for bad movie fans and possibly professional dancers only."
4,WAY TO GO MANERO!!,"I love 'Staying Alive', it's one of my all time favourite movies and John Travolta films. I love the direction Sylvester Stallone took it in. The music is exciting, the actors were great in their parts,and the dancing was filled with energy. And I'm so excited that it's been released onto DVD."
5,Best electro-rap-house record ever seen!,"This albulm is one of the best albulms in the world. Even if it is commercial it still is great. Freestyler rocks! Tha best song in the world...I think, Uprocking Beats made for breakers (b-boys, u know!) also Freestyler etc., contains very great electro-jungle/drum'n'bass- house and rap-songs, specially for tha breakers!"
4,Learn while you drive,"Use this CD on long road trips and really enjoy it. Works while you're using it, now I just have to figure out a way to remember everyting I'm learning!"
3,"The first CD is good, but........","As others have said, the first CD is very good, but the speakers on every CD afterwards speak waaaay too fast. Don't know what they were thinking. I would recommend Michel Thomas ""Foundation Italian"", Assimil ""Italian with ease"" or Pimsleur for a serious and more complete language program that is designed to take you beyond tourist phrases."
4,Good but not great,"I bought this cd set to prepare for a trip to Italy. The first CD is marvelous just like the other reviewers said. From then on, some lessons are very helpful for the tourist, some less helpful. I listen to each lesson over and over because they allow very little time for repitition. Whereas on the first cd they repeated things 3 times which was a lot, in the second and subsequent cd they give you only once chance to practice a word, phrase or sentence. The grammar lessons get a little hard going as well. The two native speakers, a man and a woman, have slightly different ways of saying things which is helpful to hear. All in all I recommend this for someone who needs to learn some key things in Italian for a trip."
4,It's Gainsbourg!,"It's Gainsbourg, so it is rather hard to go wrong. A voice that one would recognize anywhere at any time. It is a great album to take one away from the humdrum of the daily grind. Pour some wine, sit back and prepare to relax and bop your foot along."
4,Great kitchen clock,"When my old antique plate clock suddenly fell off the wall and crashed to pieces, it was the chance to shop for something brand new and different. This retro style is perfect for my eclectic style kitchen and the color blends in with my retro pottery collection. The face is easy to read from far away and my only minor complaint is that the ticking is a little loud. I might tape a piece of cloth over the mechanism to muffle the sound."
4,"Great Erasure Song,,,,","This is definitly classic Erasure,,,Great Remixes and I like the B-side,,I Like It...overall,,worth having if you love Erasure,,,,,"
3,misses slides,"I find the remote works nicely most of the time, however, it seems at the most critical moments in a presentation it fails to respond to a slide change. I use it at about 40 feet so I don't think its a range issue. After a couple of clicks it starts working again."
5,No problems,"I purchased the Interlink Electronics VP4810 on August 22, 2007 and have been using it through the USB connection to a computer using Windows XP as the OS. I had used this product for a number of years at one institution that supplied the units but moved to another institution that did not. I was not happy at all with the wireless mouse the institution supplied and which was the only tool I could use to advance slides when away from the computer desk, so I purchased my own VP4810 and use it as a portable unit. I have had absolutely no trouble with it (I downloaded the software from Interlink's website rather than use the disc that came with the unit so I could, hopefully, get the most recent software version). I admit I use it only as a two-button mouse and do not, as yet, use all the other features that come with the software. I appreciate the freedom the unit gives me in making presentations and the laser pointer feature is also very handy."
2,computer remote mouse,This sounded like a great idea. My son has one and loves it. I have not been able to get comfortable using it.
4,Does NOT have Liszt's two-piano version of piano concerto no. 1,"The Amazon listing incorrectly shows that this CD contains S650, Liszt's two-piano version of piano concerto no. 1 It includes only the more common version S124."
4,Tanya,"Product is of professional quality. It is very easy to install and looks beautiful on the glass. It brings in the light well, yet provides privacy. If you choose to purchase this product, you will not be disappointed."
3,"Not hard to apply with a professional look, but privacy is lacking","It's certainly possible to apply this easily with only one person. Use a lot of spray and work carefully to get out the air bubbles and you will have a professional looking result. The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn't obscure the view as much as I anticipated it would. I used this in a bathroom window and after applying it, one could still fairly clearly see shapes in the bathroom. Yes, it wasn't totally clear, but it was more than I anticipated. Strangely, I can't see any of the outside from inside my bathroom with this film on, but you can see somewhat from the outside looking in. I layered a semi-sheer curtain over it and it solved the problem. I think this level of obscurity would work well for a living area, but may not be sufficient for a bathroom. However, this is a nice option because it lets in a good amount of natural light while providing some level of privacy."
4,Runt of the Litter Comes Across,"I read this book when I was maybe ten years old, then read it again and again. I found the wilderness adventure quite exciting, especially the snow storm, and I loved that the runt of the litter proved himself worthy. For any kid who loves dogs, outdoor adventure, the wilderness, and snow, this is a great read."
2,"Amazon, please get this straightened out!","I'm writing here to protest Amazon's sloppy listing. I have been hunting for a DVD copy or VHS copy of the Chicago Lyric Opera production of Eugene Onegin with Mirella Freni. Alas, they have lumped several different versions of this opera together as if they all had the same cast, although it is obvious these are all different performances. What is even worse is that for each different production, they have repeated the same comments. Hey, Amazon---WAKE UP please and fix this. Each entry of Eugene Onegin is listed as being performed by Freni, Dvorsky, etc., although it should be obvious the casts are entirely different. (sigh of disgust..)"
4,Needs better instructions,I bought this to be used with the SC-1000 alarm system I purchased at the same time. (See my comprehensive review of the SC-1000.) There was nothing in the instructions about how to use this as just an external siren. I had to download the AA-433 instructions from Skylink's website. Finally got it working. Very loud!
5,great,"the sandals are very comforatble and you cant beat that price, i would defintely invest in these sandals."
4,ipod stuff,"sound aint the best, but sure is convenient when travelling.i keep it my suit case all the time"
4,Great little speakers,"These speakers have great sound and are so small and portable. I run conferences worldwide and needed little speakers to take with me for presentations. These work fine for a small group (just what I needed). It was a little difficult (at first) figuring out battery door and cord attachments, but now that I've got those down, I'm happy."
4,"Good Sound, Mostly Usable Form Factor","So as others have said previously, quality and quantity of sound from this liitle unit is impressive. Works well with my Zune and my Dell computer. Comes with a variety of connector cables to handle many different hookups. Had a little issue with the jacks in the back of the unit not making good connection at first but this went away after a few cycles of use (not sure why, guessing the receptacles just seated themselves better in the unit). Main complaint is same others have noted, have to pull all the connections in the back of the unit to close the lid and turn it off."
2,Why do they shut off automatically?,"I bought these to have sent to Iraq where I am currently stationed. My wife received them in a timely manner, no complaints about shipping. They were new just as I planned. When she plugged them into her ipod to make sure they worked, she told me that they turned off. I had her check to make sure there was no EQ that would affect them. So this is the problem, im not getting any volume, only slightly quieter than a normal indoor talking voice. Needless to say, they do not compare to the noises indide a Humvee, which is exactly where I need them. Is this just a defect, or do I need to find other speakers? By the way, its not a battery issue, it does the same thing when they are plugged into the wall, and when it happens the little orange light blinks. I press a volume button then they start working again, for a short moment."
2,Almost Very Good,"Compact, good for packing in lap top case. Good for enhancing the sound of a PC.Uses triple (AAA) battery's, battery's cost too much money. Has mini-plug to connect to a device, and a power supply that is too bulky to pack with a lap topThis unit needs to be powered by a USB cable or double (AA) battery's, or both.Are you listening? JBL"
1,Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Yes, shhhhhhhh...I have these speakers in front of me, so I don't need too much volume to hear music adequately.Because of this, I can hear this shhhhh noise, and it's annoying.The sound is OK, one star because they're JBL and the price tag."
4,Awesome .. But making the battery rechargeable woulda make it Awesomer.,I love these speakers because they produce full sound in a small package. But i would of loved to have seen it with a rechargable battery .
2,JBL On Tour Poor Sound Quality,"I purchased these speakers based on amazon reviews, many of which are positive and some of which are negative. I was looking for speakers for my Sansa e280. I definitely had higher expectations for these speakers than perhaps the $40 price would suggest. If you like listening to clock radios (I am not talking Soundwaves!), then these will probably do fine. I was not happy with the overall sound quality and returned them. I ultimately ended up spending much more for Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speakers. I am very satisfied with the Klipsch speakers."
2,"Saariaho's ""Tag des Jahrs"" retreads old ground","This Alba disc, released in 2006, contains choral works by four Finnish composers, with performances by the Tapiola Chamber Choir cond. Hannu Norjanen. In this review, I wish to comment only on Kaija Saariaho's contribution, as the piece in question has so far appeared in commercial recording only here.""Tag des Jahrs"" for choir and electronics (2001) is a setting of four poems by Friedrich Holderlin on the seasons of the year. The choral writing is reminiscent of the composer's ""Oltra mar"" of two years before, while the electronic part features distorted voices reading the poems and is very similar to the electronic part of ""Lonh"", written five years before. So, Saariaho isn't breaking any new ground with this work. The four movements also don't feel very different at all, through you'd expect a work based on the seasons to have a great deal of variety. I'd say the work could be left to completists."
4,very interesting...and it tend to get you INTO the story...,"This book has a very interesting story, it's very detailed from beginning to the end. I think to be able to understand this book, age 15 or older is recommended."
3,Too long but interesting,"""In Cold Blood"" by Truman Capote is in fact a good book, but it was also way too long for the content that it contained. Capote seemed to explore each character to their core, not letting you miss a beat of their life. This either made me want to fall asleep or throw the book out the window because it was so boring at parts. Exposing the character's life is a necessity to a book, but Capote took the description way too far. On a positive note, the book was very interesting at times. You got to know the characters well and you began to feel sorry or hateful toward them. The book covered the Clutter case very well and it was very detailed. I gave this book 3 stars because even though it was a good book, the length and too developed characters made it a boring read at times."
5,Crime writing doesn't get any better than this...,"a canonical text, truly a ""can't put it down read"" in every sense of the phrase. You'll be thinking about this story for days after you finish it. Treat yourself to a wonderful, compelling American masterpiece of crime literature."
2,Book Review,"The book is a little dry, hard to read at times. If you are from Kansas and like history you can get through it."
5,Best book I have ever read,"I read this book at 13 at the recommendation of my brother, and it was as magnificent a literary achievement as I have ever read. ALL the people in it are depicted as human beings, deep and sometimes unpredictable. This is a genuine masterpiece."
5,GREAT OF TYPE,"The most impressive thing about this book, aside from the events, which are true of course, is the absence of ""style"".Capote realizes that an evident style (as F. Scott Fitzgerald or Hemmingway for example) would detract from the power of the events and add a surface covering of soapoperaness or the point of view of condemnation or justification that makes Malmud's ""The Fixer"" less than the work it could have been in the hands of a genius. Capote shows a kind of genius, or at a minimum very keen judgement in his writing. The movie made from the story was good. It lacks the sense of brilliant detachment that makes this book special. The closest modern author in English I know of is Joseph Conrad. I recommend Capote's book."
3,Too Many Details,"In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is a true story about the sudden murders of a family. You get a detailed account of every aspect of the murders and even get to know the killers intimately. The novel starts with the family alive and doing their day to day activities and by the end you know exactly what happened to them and what happened to the two murderers. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in knowing EVERYTHING about the tragedy. Capote really doesn't leave any detail out when telling this story. In some parts of the novel it is very slow and there are many parts that could have been left out. You really do get a sense of the characters personalities and it feels like you know them personally after finishing this book. Overall, In Cold Blood was an interesting story but definitely not a suspenseful page turner."
3,Could be better,"While the point of view was interesting and different, i thought that the story was way too top-heavy. The endless flood of details at first added to the book, but eventually seemed to drag it down. The way he describes his characters, though is really well done, making us feel sorry for Perry and being able to understand him. But otherwise, it seemed to be a rather dry book."
1,No Espionage in this book,"Why is this book rated in the Top Ten most popular ""Espionage Non-Fiction"" books when there is absolutely not one word involving espionage anywhere in this book?"
3,"My son says ""boring""","Well, what do you want? Assigned reading for a teenager of a book written 50 years ago. I guess it's not CSI. Meanwhile, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Capote,"" the movie about the making of this book, so I want to read ""In Cold Blood"" for myself."
4,Would have been 5 stars 40 years ago!,"After seeing both film versions of the writing of this book, I decided it was high time to read this classic. And it is a genuine classic, no question about that. If I had read it when it first came out, I'm sure I would have been stunned along with the rest of the country. Reading it now, after the genre has been taken to new heights by the likes of Tom Wolfe (The Right Stuff) and others, it didn't pack quite the punch I expected. But it still packs a punch, no question about it. It still has the power to make you sick to your stomach as he takes you through the last hours of the Clutter family. There are moments of wonderful writing, as wonderful as writing can be about such disturbing events."
4,A book on a documentary of the Clutter family killings,I was reading through some of these reviews.One of them shocked me he gave it one star cause he thought that the documentary was about the author trying to make people feel pity for the killers.That is what i don't understand. The author is telling the story like it is.It is a documentary.It was not his own story.I have read this for summer reading going into ninth grade.I choose this book because i heard a lot of praise. It was a very well written book.
3,A classic with no climax.,"While I was enthralled by the words Capote so eloquently put on paper, I was unable to get beyond the fact that there were no surprises awaiting us in this story. While his portraits of both killer and victim are superb, I finished this book expecting more."
3,An Exploitation of a Tragedy,"I was intrigued by In Cold Blood when I first heard that it took place in Kansas. But I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the book. I didn't like Capote's choice of Perry as the main character and was bored by Capote's long tirades about the justice system and his in-depth description of Perry's background.I feel that the real horror of the Clutter family murders was overlooked by Capote and he just used the shock value of the murders as a lure for readers. The real story wasn't about the Clutters, Holcomb, or the investigation, but about Perry, who I personally disliked. I believe that the story could have been written better by another author who didn't exploit the murder of an innocent family to attract readers."
3,The cover is not in perfect condition,I got this book yesterday. Maybe I'm a perfectionist but the black ink on the cover was smudged. The rest seem to be fine.
5,In Cold Blood,"I read this book many year ago, loaned it and never got it back. Read it again and remembered it was the most well written book I have ever read."
3,"Still good, but the nonfiction novel has since improved","In Cold Blood tells the true story of the senseless murder of the midwestern Clutter family in the 1950s. The search for and the story of the two pitiful ex cons who were guilty of the horror is the book's focus. Although the nonfiction novel has evolved substantially over the years, Truman Capote is clearly a pioneer in writing captivating non fiction which reads like fiction. The story is well told and interestingly organized. Capote does a seamlessly delicate job of relaying the cold blooded nature of the crime but at the same time giving the reader an opportunity to glimpse the human side of Dick Hickock and Perry Smith from childhood to death row. Capote leaves just enough space for the reader to wonder and interpret things about the telling of the story to make the tale one dimension richer than it seems."
4,Must have been quite significant at the time,"Murder in small town, homosexual overtones, graphic descriptions - must have really shook up the world in 1966. Even today is a captivating read. Capote has a way with words and that makes this story probably more entertaining than it should be. He paints the time very well and as the reader you go back to a much different time."
3,"Interesting allthough outdated, in MY opinion.","I have read the short stories by Truman Capote and I was thrilled. However ""In cold blood"" somehow dissapointed me, probably because I carried too much of his short stories in my mind. As I am not an american nor do I live in the US, I find it hard to relate the awful and horrid happenings the book describes with tales or relations of nowadays. T.C. was undoubtly a great writer and I enjoy his ability to describe situations and events. I am only sorry not to have read his book many years earlier."
5,"Haunting, compelling, and beautifully written",What strikes me most is that Truman Capote is a beautiful writer. That he can take such a horrible crime and write about it so evocatively just stunned me as I read. I am looking forward to reading more of his work.
3,In Cold Blood,"Murder is the one word that describes this novel. A tale of mystery, suspense, and betrayal are the key points that this book illustrates. In Cold Blood is a novel about a farm family with a good reputation throughout a small town in Kansas. In one moment, more than half of that family is forever silenced by the sounds of a shotgun. In one instant, the Clutter family is lying dead and covered in a pool of their own blood. Who is the murderer? Why did the killer commit this autrocity? These are the two main questions one must ask himself. Howver, with no logic or visible evidence to the murder, how does one solve a mystery with no clues? In Cold Blood symbolizes the perfect crime and the most challenging mystery to solve."
2,I didn't even finish this one!,"I don't know what Mr. Capote was thinking. Early in the book you know that they all die AND you know who did it. What's up with that? So much for suspense! Truman Capote was very amusing in Murder by Death, though. And did you ever see Rich Little's impersonation of Truman Capote as Tiny Tim in his rendition of A Christmas Carol? It was incredible! He does W.C. Fields as Scrooge. Truly an inspired performance. Rich Little is a true master. I'd like to read a book about his life."
2,"Tropic of Cancer good, rest mediocre","The only song that really has some vibrancy is Tropic of Cancer. The remainder sorta melts away, not really memorable, 5 minutes after you hear it.I blame the choice of songs, and a failure to really harness the texture of Ms. Reilly's voice."
3,Good for practice,"The Victor Silvester Orchestra (VSO) was England's most important and most durable dance orchestra. They originated ""strict tempo"" dancing in the 1930s. Led by Victor for thirty-five years, Victor Jr. took over in the 1970s. ALL of these tracks come from this later period, and they have a funky seventies sound to them. There are no vocals. Some of the tempos are odd, but there is a lot of good music here if you want to practice your dance steps!"
2,very diappointing,I'm afraid I must agree with the first reviewer about this production. Dimitra is a great diappointment. She has a strange hesitant approach to her scale singing; soft then strident and fadeing in and out. I found it most disturbing. Also disturbing was watching her as she juts out her jaw. In her long scene with husband Don Alfonso I found myself enjoying his singing and recoiled when she would start. I found Iori the be the best singer of the cast. I thought the sets and the production adequate and appropriate. The other singers were fine for this second circuit Italian house. I enjoyed the dances and the banqueting; though I would like to have seen the coffins in the final scene. It would have been a delicious touch. I'll file this DVD away and it will gather dust; my DVD with Sutherland and Kraus does not get dusty. Now there is a real singer!
2,Has No Second Hand,"Can't believe an industry leader like Infinity is producing an item without one, but looking at their other clocks on Amazon, it appears to be very common. To me, that's unacceptable, and I sent it back."
5,I love my clock.,This clock is very cute - the cheery orange color perks up my kitchen and blends with its vintage look.Word.
5,From a review from Flight Training magazine,"When Judy Tarver speaks, at least when she speaks about airline pilot careers, the aspiring professional pilot should listen. This ""seminar-to-go"" book is chock-full of useful information on preparing for a professional pilot career. Judy covers education, building flight time, extracurricular activities, selecting flying jobs, and the importance of record keeping."
5,Best Sleigh Ride Ever,I've been looking for this classic for years. Like everyone else - MANY wonderful childhood memories attached to this album. I love all the arrangements but this version of Sleigh Ride is by far the best ever recorded - quite a punch from the trombone section to bring it on home.
5,Never know what to expect.,I am currently on the 7th novel in this series and still can not figure it out. Hewson has a way of making you think one thing and then blowing you away with the result. Can not get enough.
4,GREAT!!,This was so worth the money!! We are using it for a reward system and it worked perfectly.well made and the locks and key work great!
2,Out of date,"Unless you are really heading for unconventional climbing, I do not recommend buying this book. You are better off surfing websites about climbing in Ecuador. Moreover, it is now out of date."
2,What's with the holes?,"I saw this and thought immediatly that this would be perfect for my guinea pigs cage cleaning. But, I was wrong. All the poop came out the holes! I gave it 2 stars because it at least removes the bedding so I only have to pick up the poo"
2,Move on!,"Don and David are not unique or hugely talented. I do believe ""Shadow and Jimmy"" proves my point. There is nothing original nor spectacular about their music, which is why they didn't make it big. Conceptually they were precocious, but they are not musicians in the true sense of the word. They make better producers, especially Don. Today, their sound in What up Dog is digitally infantile, but good for 1988. David's lyrics are repetative and lack compassion/empathy. For the most part it was about men taking advantage of women. If, God forbid, they were to release another album, I'm afraid we'd be in for more of the same: Sophisticated digital concoctions and a soap opera, lyrical account of women being taken advantage. No, please don't do it! Move on...."
4,History of Music in the 20th Century,"I think that ""Dad, I'm in Jail"" is a song that represents the history of music in the 20th century. The rest of the album is great but not spectacular. However ""Dad, I'm in Jail"" should be hailed as the greatest song ever written in the 20th century (with the exception of many Flaming Lips songs)"
4,"Red-hot rockabilly,smokin' tires and moonshine aplenty!","Andy Armstrong reaches far back into the hills and glens of smokey mountain moonshine running in the late '50's. The sounds of throaty engines bellowing down tranquil leaf-strewn winding backroads are punctuated only by wailing sirens, howling tires, booming gunshots and broken glass. Attention to detail is stunning,as the viewer is transported back in time to a back-woods struggle between family tradition, stormy relationships,personal pride, federal law. Classic rock-a-billy music from the Sun Record studio accompanies this vintage look at the emotions and reckless courage behind a dangerous battle to stop the flow of white lightning, once and for all, and the price that had to be paid. A smorgasbord of vintage 50's memorabilia with a kickin' rock-a-billy soundtrack awaits eager nostalgia and car buffs. Well done! Too bad it is no longer available in Canada for purchase..."
2,saw no difference,"Used product for several weeks and saw no difference in nitrates going down, they did however go up and I switched to purigen and now my nitrates are going back down"
5,Great,I'm so glad you have these rabbit cookies it's the only place I can by them my rabbits love them :o)
2,Not one of his winners,"This really isn't up to Mr. Francis' usual high standards. The main character is an investigator for the Jockey Club, and that is pretty much all we learn about his character or motives. He is more a plot device than a living human being with whom one can empathize. The villains aren't particularly interesting either, nor any of the supporting characters. The story could have been more involving if the characters had been better drawn, but as it is, it drags. Francis is such a fine writer that nothing he has done is totally worthless -- but this book is only worth one reading, and one puts it aside with a sigh of regret that this very skillful author didn't have the time or inclination to give us a better race."
2,Sub Par for Francis,"It had been a while since I had read anything from Dick Francis and I was in the mood for a mystery and saw Slay Ride at a used bookstore for $2.00. Let's just say it's a good thing that I didn't pay any more.The bulk of the murder-mystery story takes place in Norway. After main character, David Cleveland is sent to investigate a death is Oslo; he is nearly killed in a boating mishap.The book takes some predicable turns until the killer is flushed out.By the end of the novel, I was quite bored and the end left me unfulfilled.I am used to a better quality novel from Dick!"
2,Beach boys,I think the audio here is really bad. Now it maybe simply my playback system in the car;but these guys are much better than this disc suggests
5,Beach Boys still a great group,I'm a old time Beach Boys fan. I saw this CD on Amazon and ordered it. Great collection of the greatest Beach Boys tunes. The delivery was fast.
4,Review ?,"I think I have already sent in a review, but I notice the other day when I went to put the CD in my Itunes, that the the song names and the group name did not come up in Itunes. It is no big deal, I guess, but I wonder what kind of CD copy this, not that I would know the difference, anyway it plays good and sounds good, hopefully for a long time............."
2,Sounds of Summer - The Very Best of the Beach Boys,I remember them as being better than this. The recording was weak. There was very little dynamic range. Bass was absent. I was very disappointed. Better pass this one up.
5,Help Me Somebody,"Anyone cynical enough to regard this release with suspicion (I was) should give it to someone under the age of fourteen (I did; it was her thirteenth birthday) and watch what happens. You can then 'borrow' it with impunity. Besides, it has the mono-single version of 'Help Me, Rhonda', the Greatest Car Radio Song In The Universe Ever Bar None, which you can blast as you go cruising through the hamburger stand without your old man, man."
4,The Beach Boys very best,"By David M. BeardEditor and Publisher of Endless Summer Quarterly; The World's Leading Beach Boys PublicationThe Beach Boys gather new fans every year, which is a testament to their transcendent sound. Thirty of the group's most well-known classic hits are gathered together here with a new T-Shirt. Jump start The Beach Boys 50th year in the recording business with this release! This collection is a must-have for any recently enlisted summer music fanatic."
2,"Incomplete, just as Beatles 1 is incomplete","""It's OK"" missing? NOT okay! Their best 45 release in the 70s, and a personal favourite for Mike ""Ego"" Love's lyrics: ""Lookin' Good Down The Hood Of A Funky Ride, On The Way To The Tide Just To Tan Yer Hide....""There are rumours that a two CD set is being compiled on the BBs, featuring 40 top 40 international hits. Wait for it instead. This gets two stars because it would be a good purchase for neophytes -- or as a gift for Christmas, birthdays, etc. If you're serious about learning the BBs' legacy, pick up GH 1, 2, and 3. Or buy the box set.By the way, for those not ""in the know"" about the Beatles, they had a handful of other #1 hits worldwide, including the posthumous ""Real Love"" and ""Free As A Bird"". Beatles 1 should've been two -- CDs, that is."
3,Okay but not great,"This is just a compilation of songs, and as such it doesn't have the feeling of flow that original albums have."
1,A Mixed bag of audio recordings.,"This review is on the sound quality of ""Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys"" . The music speaks for itself. I found playback on my computer (tried multiple drives) was terrible on tracks 2,3,5,7,10,11,12,21,22,26,27,28, and 30. I played them on my car stereo and home DVD player and they sounded much better. This is still a Major disappointment. The rest of the CD was fine on what ever I played them on. Cannot listen to the troubled tracks on my mp3 player. I agree with another reviewer who said ""Endless Summer"" is a much better collection of Beach Boys music(sounding). My opinion is, if its for the car or home CD player only, go ahead and buy it. If your gonna go digital with it..run away fast, it shouldn't be able to catch you."
4,EXCELLENT! NOT THE BEST SURROUND MIX FROM HER EVEN THOUGH...,"OVERALL: 4.0 starsVideo quality: 4.0 starsAudio quality: 4.0 starsExtras: 2.0 starsOther: The concert from Carnegie Hall was better in terms of audio mix. The dualdisc is not my preferred option. Nevertheless, the box is worth the cost."
1,It must be all relative,"After reading this book and then going back to the reviews posted here, I have to suspect that the reviewers are either relatives, good friends or publishing associates of the author. This book is one of the worst books I have read, and I am an avid reader! The story is simplistic, pointless and old. If you're interested in this type of story, I strongly suggest reading ""The Night Listener"" instead, if only to see what a master does with a similar storyline. I finished this book while on a New York subway, and the only reason I didn't deposit the book in the trash when I left the station was that I was afraid someone would pick it up and waste their time on it like I did. Sorry, Mr. House, but I really, really did not like your book!"
3,disappointing as a novel,"I was disappointed in this book; my opinion is that Alice Munro should stick to short stories. The descriptions were good, and the insight into the thinking of the main character was interesting, but there was no plot development, just a description of this young girl's deprived life but told with a hope that her intellectual potential might bring about a change in her life. When that just falls flat, at the end of the book the reader is left with nothing in the way of productive insight or inspiration or any satisfying closure."
1,Not the same product!,The shampoo is in a completely different packaging and the shampoo is just bubble bath soap. Very disappointed! Do not order
2,Dell 962 Ink,Placed the first two cartridges in the printer and after the alignment page the printer reports the ink is low and needs to be replaced. And this was right out of the box. I am sticking to manufacturer ink!
2,Not very well written,"I found this book to be poorly written. It does not flow very well. Honestly, it didn't make much sense. I ""got"" the point but the lack of any detail just failed what could have been an excellent story. The illustrations are quite charming, but it doesn't save the narrative. It did not hold the attention of the 5 YO that I read to today. However, it might work with a children under two or three who just want to look at the pictures and create their own story."
5,What a wonderful selection...,"I've never been much of a classical music guy. I'm the type who ends up at the bargain racks, walking out with CD's like this one thinking, ""Well, maybe there will be something on it I'll enjoy."" There was. For me, this CD is worth every penny for just one piece, Grieg's Concerto for Piano in A minor. It runs about seven minutes and, in that time, Grieg (to me, anyway) takes us through an entire life from birth to death. Every emotion comes through at different points of the piece, bridged beautifully...those emotions are expressed uniquely from gentle, to passionate, to powerful. Get the CD just for this...even if you don't like this piece, I'm sure you'll find something else on it that you'll enjoy."
1,Mislabeled & Misrepresented...,"First of all these look like chrome inside, not stainless, and they arrive with some corrosion in the metal. Second these might be a cat bowl for a kitten a few weeks old but they definitely don't hold 8 oz. as described. These are TEENY! 8 oz. of water was overflowing at 1/2 that, and a measured 4 oz. of water was just about overflowing the dish too. They are an 1"" high, and 4.75"" wide. About the size of a small ash tray. I have no idea how these can possibly be suitable for an average sized cat, and if you tried to fill them up, the food and water would be all over the place. I'm sending them back, and writing this review to save someone else from making the same mistake."
2,"An Outdated, Invalid Arguement","This book would appeal only to those who adhere to nineteenth century thinking. I stopped reading thebook after skimming the first few arguments. It seemed to me that an absolute, unquestioning acceptanceof the literal Bible was a prerequisite for reading this book."
5,Great Book,"This was a very good book to read. I have suggested it to many people that I talk to. All 50 proofs are easy to understand. Why are we letting ""scientists"" rule our generation and the ones to come?"
1,Awful,"I had to hit eject on this after about 30 minutes of torture. There is no plot, no story line, just endless multi-screen images of a 15-year-old girl's angst-ridden life. Maybe if you're 15, this film will appeal. It just looks like someone discovered split screens and went crazy with it. Skip this one."
1,What a WASTE of Ellen Page's talent and presence!,"This movie was almost impossible to watch. The already mentioned ""multiple split screens"", which sometimes numbered around a DOZEN(!!!) make watching this teen angst drama like watching it in numerous rectangular pieces of broken mirror, each with a slightly different time code. ... Ugh!Ellen Page was great in Juno, and she's at least as good here as the material will allow her to be. However, unless you are on LSD when you watch this movie, the format is likely to REALLY annoy and distract from Ellen's presence, the (deeply fragmented!) story line, and at least some of the scenes.Art film on Crack, ... filmed in multiple cracks.Don't waste your time on this one!"
3,Where's the real G?,"As much as I love Ginuwine, I must admit that I am slightly dissapointed with this CD. I know Ginuwine wanted to branch out and do some different things with his music, but he's lacking the phat beats and deep grooves that Timbaland made his songs so famous for. I would ONLY recommend this CD for ""True Ginuwine Fans"". Without Timbaland by his side, Ginuwine is just another pretty faced male R&B singer, his music nolonger stands-out from the rest of the male r&b artist out there. I did manage to find two tracks on the CD that I liked, the tracks are ""Differences"" and ""How Deep Is Your Love"" other than that, he's NOT the Same Ol' G that he use to be."
2,"""The End""","I'm a huge Ginuwine fan but this cd is weak. I knew Timbaland only did one track before I bought it and thought it still would be tight, but I was wrong. I know it's getting old hearing Ginuwine isn't the same without Timbaland but it's true, it's Timbo's sound that makes Ginuwine standout, but i'm sorry to say that Ginuwine fell off with this cd. Seriously not even worth buying."
3,His Life is Alright,"Too be truthful, this cd is alot better than I expected. I thought it was going be one of those drown out cds, because Ginuwine's background beats usually outdo him singing any how there is about 8 good songs. If you decide to buy check out, There It Is, So Fine, Why Not Me, Tribute To A Woman, Why Did You Go, Differences, 2 Way and Just Because. One Love. Queen"
1,YIKESSSSS!!!!,Ginuwine the Person is cool he has overcome alot.but Ginuwine the Artist needs to hang it up.His Voice is flat again on this set as on His Other Discs.Tired Cliched Music&Arrangements do nothing here.He is a Good Dancer maybe He can catch on with Michael Jackson's next tour or something but please put the Mike down???
4,When is this coming to anamorphic DVD?,"I love this little movie. Carrie Fisher looks even hotter than she did in that bikini thing in Jabba's lair. Very funny writing and directing. The photography is excellent and the broadcast print has aged very well. It looks more like an early 90's movie, with only the blonde seeming a bit 80's. Surprisingly, this is an ensemble cast. Hanks, though at the center of all the action, is sharing time with a lot of other talent. From beginning to end I think this film works."
3,A vaguely remembered movie,"Years ago, when I was on tour with a rock band, I saw this movie in a hotel room. I was suffering from sleep depravation (and loaded to the gils to boot), and don't remember most of it.However, there is one scene I will never forget. Hanks' character was performing. The femme fatale who was sent to do ill to him by the CIA was in the audience, and Hanks' character was gaga over her. The orchestra began Rimsky-Korsakov's Shaherazade. Those of you familiar with that symphony will know that after a brief intro, a solo violin part comes in. When it came time for Hanks' character to play it, he instead played a piece he composed for the femme fatale! David Ogden Stiers' was playing the conductor. He stopped the orchestra, turned to him and said ""Tonight we are playing 'Shaherazade.' Would you care to join us?""Perfect!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"This product is merely OK for lighter cords, but don't try to put more than 75' of quality 12/3 cord on it. I doubt very seriously that if will hold the 150' of 16/3 as advertized. I have a number of cord reels of similar price but a slightly different design. They are easier to use and of comparable capacity. I'm giving it only two stars not so much because of the product (it's a reasonable product for the price) but because of the deceptive advertizing about it capabilities."
1,Complete waste of money,"Very time consuming and frustrating to use. If you read some of the other reviews they will recommend using a zip tie to hold the middle of the cord so you can wind both ends evenly. While this does work, pulling the cord to use it is way more time consuming than it's worth and after only a week it was starting to damage the casing on the cord - aYellow Jacket 12/3 Heavy-Duty Extension Cordwhich is not some cheapo cord. This product was definitely not well thought out. Eventually I got sick of spending more time trying to wind the cord than I was actually using the tools so I went back to using the over-palm-and-under-the-elbow method. Also, I found this same exact item in L0we's for two dollars cheaper. All I can say is this is a waste of plastic."
1,junk,"absolue piece of junk! I knew it was cheap and kind of expected this to be not good, but it far exceeded my expectation of being useless."
3,it's OK,It does what it's suppose to do and for the price it's an OK product.I would have wished it was made of a heavier material and had a longer base so it does not fall over so easily.
4,Very handy gadget watch the video,"Correction watch the video and this gadget does work! Not heavy duty construction, but does the job!This was a recommendation to purchase with the 100ft extension cord, sounded like a reasonable idea to me, however, this is extremely lightweight plastic and cannot handle an outdoor cord. It was a good price and not worth returning, but totally useless for a heavier outdoor cord. Impossible to use as shown in the picture!"
3,Not what I expected,"Not what I expected, the plastic feels flimsy and has too much give, I'd spend a few more bucks for harder plastic."
2,Sort of Useless,"I followed a fellow reviewers instructions for how to set this up so the line would retrieve easily. His tip worked but it doesn't overcome the flimsy construction of the product. Frankly, there must be a better, more functional instrument for reeling up electrical cord. I would be willing to spend double for one that worked exceptionally well. I haven't found one. This isn't it. And it is a little frustrating to buy something with one purpose, and it does not do that one thing very well."
1,Quality n size,"This product is poorly designed, not strong enough and can not hold 100 to 150 feet of cord. If it was designed for wall mount, it may have performed little better."
4,Nice Storage Device...,"This is great if you just want something to roll your cord up in for storage, not much else. Its very light, but it works for me I was hanging my cord on a nail in the storage room."
3,Cord Reel,"Cord Reel of strong plastic and very light to work with, holds 150 ft of electric cable and dispensing nicely."
4,Does Hold 100 ft outdoor 12/3 extension cord,"On receiving, I was a bit skeptical, as it does seem a bit flimsy, and smaller than I thought. But following the instructions of another review, ""Works just fine for 100' 12/3 outdoor extension cord, January 12, 2010"" by Robert S. Tobias, it does fit, quite nicely, a 100' 12/3 extension cord. The horizontal foot makes a nice place to hold as you reel the cord in and allows you to guide it with your free hand. I wouldn't want to be using it daily on a construction site, but for household use, seems enough. Only time will tell as to how robust it is, but certainly makes carrying the 100' cord around a lot easier."
3,do NOT buy if you have 12/3 cord... all else should fit Ok,thinner gauge cord should fit Ok with this reel. The attached product description does show thinner gauge cord is acceptable.I have 100' 12/3 outdoor gauge... there's no way this reel will hold all 100' even if I tried somehow reeling it onto this device.The 'hook' on the center roll barely fit my 14/3 cord. I'll likely just use this reel for my indoor cords.
4,decent for what it's designed for,"What can I say? It's a power cord reel. The clip in the reel to hook your extension cord into isn't really big enough for heavy-duty cords, so you might have issues if you have an outdoor-quality cord, but I could certainly work around it. It can be a little awkward to wind the thing up once you actually get it started, but I've found that if you just brace the base of the reel against your abdomen, it becomes really easy to crank the thing in. So basically, it does the simple task it was designed for, but don't expect magic."
4,Good storage and carry reel - Holds 100-feet of 12 Gauge Cord,"I use this reel for my 12/3 100-foot Extreme Weather Extension Cord (the BEST outdoor cord ever!) and I'm really happy with the simplicity, lightness and portability of this reel. It winds easily and is compact.This 150-Foot Cord Reel holds 100 feet of 12 gauge cord perfectly - the only drawback is that the clip that holds the starter end to the reel is too small for a cord this thick. So, I just hold it in place and manually wrap the first wind, then I use the handle to wind the rest."
3,OK I USE THIS EVERY WEEK !,It is very tight to fill it in. Also there no way I since there is no positive and female without it wrapping over many times. Well I am just glad that it I can make it work !
3,Adequate but not good,"It works as described but much lighter weight plastic than I was expecting. It claims it holds 150ft but that must be for a lighter gauge wire as my 100ft 12g pretty much overflowed it's capacity. I don't think this is much better than just hand coiling the cord and throwing it over a hook and it might even be a little more trouble considering the lightweight nature of the plastic.I think it would be OK for a light extension cord, or even xmas lights strands, but I wouldn't use it for heavier cords."
2,Decent reel but it hates 12gauge or bigger,This unit is fine as long as you do not try and run the heavy duty cords. The clip in the bottom that you use to start reeling the cable does not handle a 12gauge cable at all so then you end up trying to do it without and its a pain and never works well. The unit weighs almost nothing so it flopps around a lot and the feet are not big enough to stand on to reel it in.This would be fine for thin cable but does not work for the big ones I seem to have everywhere.
5,A True Love Story,"I have read many historical romance novels, and none have ever stuck with me the way this one has. I read this book when I was 15 and I am now 24. I still get an all over wonderful feeling when I think of this book almost 10 years later. It is one of the BEST love stories I have ever had the extreme pleasure of reading. It's everything you look for in a love story, and if I remember correctly the author was inspired to write this story based upon an engraving or something of that sort that she saw on a castle which makes it all the more a thrilling read. I admire the bravery of the heroine who wants to get home safely and in order to do so she marries a man who is about to be hanged. Little did she know of the adventure and love that was about to envelope her very being."
2,"Works great, but gets wet",I had this model until it broke after a year of constant use.The main problem I had with it was that the food would occasionally become wet and clog the feeding mechanism.My goal was to be able to leave for a month and have everything work fine. The moisture problem made it impossible. I would not purchase again.
5,Encore!! Encore!!,"I had NEVER heard Syleena Johnson, but I kept hearing ABOUT her, so I took a chance and bought this CD without hearing one song. I LOVE IT!! She's got the voice, she knows how to use it, and she can sure write a song. I can't wait to hear more from her."
4,Excellent first CD,Following a chained storyline this CD features many interludes that tend to detract the listener from where it really shines and that is her voice.Powerful and deep her voice shines above and carries what would be a mediocre CD at best. Syleena really shines with such gems as I Am Your Woman and Baby I'm So Confused and really bring allow you to forgive the slow interludes.A good first attempt by a fantastic voice.
2,Mediocre,Decent for price but seem to constantly need sharpening and blades developed rust spots pretty quickly.
5,School Book,This book arrived in time for the first class. I am completely satisfied. What else can I say? That is all.
2,Mediocre effort,Some pretty good songs. Some songs just OK. And some just plain awful and NO songs on the same level as Lovin County or My Hometown. Overall a dissapointment.
3,Bring Back Lloyd Maines,"After two outstanding previous albums (Bandera and Life of the Party) that were produced by Lloyd Maines, Robison switched producers to Blake Chancey, who has produced records for his brother Bruce and The Dixie Chicks (of which his wife Emily Robison is a member). While these first two albums were not wildly successful commercially, they contained some great music. Robison clearly tried to come up with a more radio-friendly album this time around. While there are still some good songs on Step Right Up (i.e., The Wedding Song, The Preacher, One In A Million, and the title track), I was very disappointed. After wearing out his first two albums, I was really looking forward to some new Charlie Robison songs. Unfortunately, this album's sound and songs are not up to the high standards set by his previous work. It is still better than almost anything else on country radio today, though. He can do better and I look forward to a return to form on his next album."
5,Good,Enjoyed it very muchAnyone who enjoys old westerners will like it.It is a Zane Gray book to read again and again
3,Not as good,"My Great grandaughter 5 watched this with breaks in between which tells me there were parts that did not hold her attention and I would agree,it is slow in parts but for die-hard Ashley fans probably no problem."
5,Knee support,This was purchased for a friend who has to wear one of these all the time. The one he was buying was twice the price of this item. We bought 2 he was extremely pleased with the price and the product.
3,went to the well one too many times,"the original is much better, as the extra cd features leftover songs that were rightfully left out."
2,Don't like it anymore...,"This little thing was good for awhile, but then the stand broke. AND it started crashing my computer... Not just one, both of my computers. I had to use system restore just to get my computers working again. I'm not sure if its the monitor, or the displaylink driver. Either way, I don't like this monitor anymore. It was pretty good before it started crashing my computers. You'd be better off finding a different mini monitor though. And it just seems so cheaply made... The only use I would have for this now is for my laptop. I remember it not crashing my laptop a while ago. But still, I'm a bit afraid to plug it in to that too... :/"
1,"Beware, not what they promise","This monitor is nothing of what they promise. It doesn't work ""plug-n-play"", it crashes my PC when even after installing the proper drivers. The monitor doesn't even work on my Mac (which is usually forgiving of most faulty attachments). Don't waste your money or your time on this one."
1,Not good for video on OSX,Video playback on OSX on this monitor is horrible. If you're planning on using it for that purpose don't waste your money.
4,Great Record and Great History,"This is a great record from the folk-rock period of the later half of the 1960s. It also happens to be the first recording ('Houses') of Neil Young using his now famous ""Old Black"" 1953 Gibson Les Paul combined w/ the 1959 Fender Deluxe. Its the beginning of that signature sound right here."
2,The Prehistory of the Pacific NorthWest,This book was not helpful to me at all. Matson and Coupland left out many of the major archaeology sites in the Pacific Northwest. They wrote in a very technical style so if you had little to no background information it was very hard to understand. They also tended to write background information about things that were insignifigant to the site(s)being discussed. The reading didn't seem to flow well. Over all I think the book should have mainly be used for information on archaeology sites in the South region of Vancouver B.C.
1,a lame book,"This book was really stupid. It has a brutal depiction of Mexican Americans as not just losers, but real idiots as well. I can't believe Pike got away with this in this genre. Then it has Pike's now common, New Age Consciossness as filler. I've already forgotten most of the plot. There's just not much here."
1,Bat without wings,"This movie had the plot to be good but it wasn't. The kung fu scenes are not done well it literally looks like all the characters are doing a slow balerina dance. I didn't even finish the movie. It couldn't hold my attention for longer than five minutes. This move is not worth buying at all. And anyone who didn't find this review helpful probably had something to do with the production of the movie, because the movie sucks, and there is no other way to put it."
5,I love this story and the illustrations,This was a book that I grew up loving and it is so great seeing my son loving this story just as much as I did.
5,bearly believable,The writing style is clear and well structured. The adventures are of human proportions. The description of the geography and environment bring back an epoch of the country that is past.
3,"Scoop is nice and large, but the slots are too big for bunny pellets",The scoop is larger than we were expecting. This scoop would be ideal for larger pets... but the slots that are hidden behind the label are too big and bunny pellets slip right through.
1,Disappointed,"These pots arrived today. They were not 6"" pots. They were the shorter 6"" Azalea pots. They were not shipped in a box but in a plastic bag with no cushioning. They arrived damaged."
3,Good illustrations,"This book has wonderful illustrations, but I found the explanations in the text to be a little lacking. I often had to supplement this text with others taken out from the library. Good intro book, though, if you aren't looking for loads and loads of detail."
5,"Inspirational, heartwrenching, spiritual, and uplifting!","If you want to read a true story that is inspirational, giving hope to those who feel there is none. Heartwrenching to learn of one person's constant fight for survival. Spiritual in a way that will either strengthen your faith, or inspire your faith. Uplifting to know that through life's battles, we are all survivors in one way or another. Then this book is for you!"
5,At Last . . .,"This is a great recording, and I've been impatiently waiting for the CD release. There's no point in detailing the highlights, because Dave's notes on the original LP say it all succinctly -- it was an ""ordinary"" date that caught fire -- and then burned the house down. The energy builds magically from a fine ""St. Louis Blues"" to breathtaking, definitive versions of ""Blue Rondo a la Turk"" and ""Take Five."" (If you felt ""Rondo"" and ""Five"" were tentative in the original recordings, this CD set will satisfy you at last.) For those lucky enough to have seen Morello, Desmond, Wright and Brubeck play together, this will capture the memories well, and maybe go the memories one better. For those who wonder what it was like to see one of the great ensembles of jazz, this is a complete concert and a peak experience."
1,TERRIBLE,"I bought 2 of these bras, and only got one use out of EACH bra!The zipper broke on each bra , on the first time I wore them. First of all, the zipper did not fasten securely at the top where it should fasten nicely, and then the zipper was made so poorly that it broke off on each bra.I am thoroughy disappointed in this product."
2,Collected poems of Robert Service,"I'm half way thru reading....best poems were the two that were well publicized: ""The Shooting of Dan Mc Grew"" and ""The Cremation of Sam Mc Gee"" however the poet definitely is very talented in a down-to-earth....real-to-life way."
2,Cooks too hot!,"I've owned this crock pot 2 years, and I've learned to adjust cooking times, etc, but it cooks way too hot on low. Hot isn't much different than low, warm works fine. Yesterday the handle broke. It's out of warranty, so I went to order the plastic replacement part. They are out of stock. I could order another lid, but it's $10, and another $9 for shipping. For a $40 crockpot that's two years old, I won't bother. I'm just going to replace it with another brand."
4,Remote deadbolt has weak remote,"The lock looks & works great. However one remote has failed after 2 months. I fear the other may as well. Good lock, weak remote. If it had a better remote & I would give 5 stars..."
4,Great Product...terrible remotes!,I received my remote control deadbolt and had it installed and working within an hour. Just follow the directions to the letter and you should have no problem...the instructions are a little sparse but the illustrations are good. Now for the remotes...if they were a little better I would have given 5 stars. They are very cheaply made...now don't get me wrong...they work...just you may have to push the button 2 or 3 times...mostly twice for me. Since I haven't had them too long I can't say how long they will last...but it wouldn't surprise me if they lasted only six months. They are however cheap to replace. Anyway lock performs great...remote has a decent range (30 - 40 feet) just hope the remote lasts longer than it looks.
1,Warped,"Every piece was warped. I was able to put it together, but because of the poor design, some of the pieces fall out. The directions are horrible, and none of the pieces are labeled so you don't know what the picture is referencing as alot of the pieces are similar but different enough to cause problems. If you love your child and want them to be happy, get a different dollhouse."
3,"Wonderful toy, but be prepared for repairs.","We've had this dollhouse for a while and it has been great fun and has inspired a lot of imagination. It has a simple design that encourages creative play. The fact that it comes in two pieces means that it can be put together to fit the play area better. My only complaint is the quality of the construction. Overall, it is very sturdy. However, we had to glue several of the pieces back together after a short time. The dollhouse was well cared for, but the glue isn't really that great. I think the quality should be better for the price. I'm not sure about buying more Plan Toys for this reason. But, after the glue dried, we have continued to enjoy our dollhouse."
1,heater,"this heater only lasted a year, It came with a big dent, it was poorley made i woulnt buy this again"
1,Worst customer service. Cheap quality!,"WORST customer service ever. ""your lucky you got 5 years out of it"" That is exactly what I was told by CS rep about the 450 dollar, broken heater I have. They offered me no help, no service, just said.. too bad. Only to find out, not only did I over pay... but the product is junk! Not made in the US as advertised. Not supported by the company for service. Contacted the retailer and was told ""Oh yes... Marley is horrible for customer service, we have had problems with them as well"" Enter at your own risk folks!"
5,Who knew a canoe trip could be so interesting?,"This book is an account of Olson's canoe journey down long stretches of the Churchill and Sturgeon Weir rivers in Saskatchewan. Olson was a leading popularizer of the notion of wilderness, associated with the North Country of Minnesota and Canada.The story of someone else's canoe journey risks being mind-numbingly boring: ""we paddled, portaged falls, and then paddled some more."" Olson's story isn't any different than that basic narrative, but he manages to make the journey more lyrical. Observations about the empty land they traverse, the comraderie of the company of six, reminiscences of the voyageurs of old, and occasional encounters with other people leaven the basic narrative.It's a great read, and I literally didn't put it down (I was stuck on a transatlantic flight, but even so). Heartily recommended."
3,"Love asthetics, but doesn't stay together","It's beautiful. I loved it when I first got it and put it together. But once the toys got in there and challenged the sides, the bolts kept coming out. It is very poorly designed. So we took it apart and use it as wall decorations. Not recommended."
1,expensive junk,"I bought a bag of this at a local petstore to try it out on my ferret. Its litter and it does what its supposed to do, but seriously; its expensive, has to be changed often and gets very mushy when used. Its horrible. Living on east coast, spraying out the litter pan with the water hose outside is usually not an option in winter time (except this winter very mild).After a day, I threw the left over contents out into the woods behind my house and switched back to newspaper. Newspaper folds neatly into the corner litter pan, after baazu is done with her duties, I just roll it up, discard and replace with new paper. Takes less than a minute to complete. I have absolutly no oder from my cage. (my wife wouldnt let me keep it if it did) I rarely have to use the water hose. Seriously dont buy this junk and dont kid yourself into thinking you have to have it."
3,Not happy,"The Cd its great, but dvd i cant see the show. Its all white, no sound or image. Not happy with this, and i check this a week ago cause i only used the cd. But curious i put dvd to see the show and i was so sad. Cant see it. I try it in my laptop, my home theather and in both no show."
5,The Best of Sade,I always been a Sade fan. I lost this cd long time ago & I wanted to get it again! I love it! I strongly recommend it!
4,SADE THE LATIN QUEEN,"HAD HEARD HER MUSIC ON RADIO AND JUST HAD TO HAVE HER CD. IT DID NOT LET ME DOWN. IT MOVES THE BODY, MIND AND SOUL. LOVED IT."
4,Stunning Fiddling,Lakatos is without doubt an incredible musician with possibly the best facility around. He is comfortable and more than competent with every style he plays - from gypsy to jazz.
3,For ballet fans,"I am no lover of ballet, so the standard to which I held this documentary about the various permutations of the most influential ballet company of the 20th century was that it should make me feel like I've been missing out on something. I wanted to be swept up by the enthusiasm of the filmmakers and their subjects. This often happened during the charming interviews with the company members looking back on those heady days. The narrative, however, was a lengthy catalog of intrigues, seperations, and reconciliations that failed to hold my interest. The archival footage is valuable to devotees of the art form."
4,A Golden Age,"I saw this company first in 1947, and followed them for about ten years. They were my introduction to ballet, and the dancers I remember were Alexandra Danilova, Natalie Krassovska, Frederic Franklin, and Nicolas Magellanes. Others came -- Ruthanna Boris, Mia Slavenska, Nina Novak -- but my memory of ballet is full of these early performances and those early dancers. It is inspiring to see them in this film, as full of love for their art as they were when performing.There is one area where I disagre slightly. I remember Nina Novak in the chorus, and she had charisma. You watched her. When she was given more important roles, you continued to watch her. What she did in her private life was irrelevant; she drew the eye.This is a must-see for every lover of ballet who is curious about how it started in America, and became the center of interest that it holds today.Baronova is astonishing!"
3,For $7.00 dollars The Set Is Alright For What It Is,Getting this more on a nostalgic feeling more then anything else I was somewhat surprised how I found this newer series to be more entertaining then the 80's series. While this takes a somewhat more serious turn then the 80's version this series is meant to also be seen by both young and older teenagers or fans of the series in general. The animation while not the worse out there is still somewhat lacking though again for the price it is forgivable especially for anime fans as you can hear some longtime favorite actors and actresses you might remember from other anime shows. For $7.00 dollars the set was worth checking out but if you're still unsure on if you should get the set check a few episodes out online before making your choice.
2,It goes down hill faster as it gets closer to the end,"I guess seeing a cute blonde who passes out from too much alchohol and getting rides home from various strange men with various intentions might be someone's idea of a good idea for a film. I suppose that having a cute blonde go after a guy because he reminds her so much of her fiance could be exciting. I't even possible that a fairly intelligent college student could throw away his dreams as this cute little blonde draws him in to all her bizarre behavior. A group of us watched this movie together and the concensus was unanimous: This is one bad movie. At 95 minutes, it was about 65 minutes too long. The set up was horrible, the plot was tedious and absolutely impossible and the characters weren't even that likable. As much as I like Elisha Cuthbert, I cannot recommend this film at any level. Cute though she might be, this film is one to pass on. Several of us regret the hour and a half we spent suffering thorugh 'MY SASSY GIRL'."
5,Heavy music lovers- take a chance on this one,"I was not expecting to like this album, much less fall in love with it. This album was described to me as a ""wall of sound, as heavy as you can imagine, but harmonic"".That's a pretty good description, but describing this CD is tricky because there's nothing out there close enough to compare it to. I could see comparisons to Neurosis or Isis (especially track 7, ""man/woman""), but not direct ones.The artwork that comes with the CD is fantastic as well, designed by Aaron Turner of Isis.If you like stuff on Hydra Head records, if you like heavy music, but also beautiful music you can chill out to, I give this CD my highest possible recommendation."
3,"Great start, bad ending.","I liked this book and thought the characters were really realistic and likable. The plot was okay, and I was excited to get to the ending, only to be disappointed by how rushed and anticlimactic it was."
1,Attention!!! Fire danger!!!,Luckily I recognized that something is wrong with this device as I used it. Heating ok...but I saw some waterdrops INSIDE the device. I opened it and...the foam around the flow chamber was partly melted!I recommend not to use this device!!!
5,"Clear, informative, and interesting!","This book is a wonderful integration of personality factors with financial management. The material is so clearly presented that anyone can grasp the principles, yet it gives a new application of Myers-Briggs Personality Typing to the financial domain that can expand the understanding of professionals. The many exercises and tables of concise terms are helpful in assessing one's needs and values and increasing self-awareness of one's inner motivations. Certainly not a ""one-size-fits-all"" universal prescription, this, instead, helps to tailor one's use of money to achieve true wealth and personal satisfaction."
2,A guilty pleasure for a while,"The Vines have good pop music. That's all you can really say about them. They aren't original, aren't good for more than 10 or so listens, and aren't the future of rock. However, few people really care about that. I thought they were fun to listen to for a while, but I found my radiohead and wilco Cds came in much more frequently. I love nirvana, and when I heard ""Get free"" I thought the vines were the future of rock. They aren't, as evidenced by 7 or 8 absolute filler tracks in this short Cd. The only other good ones are Aint no room and Mary Jane, which both sound like the Beatles. When the vines are original, they [are bad]."
2,La Jhon Lennon Band,"tiene un par de canciones para entretenerse un rato, para pasar el momento. pero en general parece un grupo jugando a ser The Beatles con algunos tics de Nirvana. la verdad ninguna de sus canciones convence en su totalidad, solo es un disco del monton.de las canciones podria rescatar la cancion Autumn Shade, aunque la psicodelia beatles ya fue explotada demasiado por Oasis. no se, algo sobrevalorado el grupo este."
3,Promising Debut,"I'm not as knocked out as most people seem to be about this debut album by Australia's Vines. Out of the 12 songs, I like four. My favorite is ""Factory"", a bouncy ska tune that reminds me of the Specials at their best. Next favorite is the wistful ""Homesick"", with echoes of McCartney and the Beach Boys. ""Outathaway"" is more typical of the crunching garage-rock found scattered throughout this album, but it's the only one in that style that impresses me. ""Mary Jane"" is another fine pop ballad. In places the Vines sound like the Beatles circa ""Sgt Peppers"", elsewhere they call to mind the Kinks, and elsewhere Nirvana, but some of the songs are just too abrasive for me, and others lack a compelling melody to hold them together. At their best the Vines are very good, but hopefully on future albums they can achieve a bit more consistency."
1,mediocre,"I thought this album was mediocre at best. The 'The' bands have been hyped so much, and The Vines definitely do not deliver. Sure, they're better than Limp Bizkit and Creed, but thats not saying much. These are a set of straight up rock songs which 10 years ago no one would have paid any attention to. And the fame has obviously gone to the lead singer's head. His pretentious atmosphere and feigned disconnectedness are disgusting. The size of his ego is no way commensurate with his talent. What a loser. I would have given the album another star if it wasn't for how annoying he is."
1,over-rated,I don't know what people see in these guys. The songs just aren't interesting. Thy can't seem to make up their mind if they want to be rediculously bad Nirvana imposters or a terrible pop band. Maybe I wouldn't hate them so much if they didn't get so much praise. They just don't deserve it. When did everyone become so misguided? I want my Seven Dollars back.
2,Think they're really good?,"I think this is a very pretentious band. Mean come on ,everyone can tell they try to be rock saviours Radiohead, i saw them once and man they were seriously trying hard to pull off the act. Two stars for the effort."
3,nice very much,"i had already heard the song ""get free"" a ton of times and i liked the positive energy from the bands lead singer when he performed on tv. so i bought this cd.it is really good and nicethe only negative that i could come up with is there just seems to be a little loosness in the voice department. the singer usualy rocks, but just every now and then - something [is weak].the slow songs on this album are good.so this album really is one you should pick up and the cover on the japanese version is actually painted by the band ."
1,Most Overrated Album of 2002,"I don't listen to the radio, so for new music connections I rely a lot upon reviews and (in weak moments) occasionally media hype. I should have known better. I like The Strokes, and The White Stripes older stuff is decent, but this album made me sick. I've tried to give it a way so it won't taint my honorable music collection, but it seems my friends aren't the sucker I was. I listened to the album a couple of times but there wasn't one moment of excitement.Honestly, The Vines have been included in the media's ""rebirth of rock,"" but there is nothing on this album that warrants repeated listening. Unless you've heard the band and know you like it, I strongly suggest buying a pack of cigarettes and some porn instead."
3,"Descent at best , But mainly a mess","Lets forget the hype for a minute , the vines record highly evolved is the reflection of a band that entered to a recording studio before they had defined their sound .The kids playin is not half bad , not great either , they sound like a band that could put a decent show of covers in a small club , but they're far away from highly evolved , or even a bit evolved.The low points includes the awful nirvana bleach era like get free , which is non passion screaming plain screaming . The vine's beatle song factory that is so beatle- like in a bad way that's embarrasing .The highlights - Include the great opening track which is a nice mid tempo rocker, and the rolling stone like aint no room .The rest , well is kind of in the middle not so good not so bad , just like the album"
5,Great Driving Music,"Last week I saw the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine that featured The Vines. The cover read ""Rock is Back!"" I was intrigued so I bought the CD. It is hands down the best debut album that I've heard in years!The first time I listened through I thought the songs were alright. They sounded even better the second time through. By the third listen I was completely hooked! While the songs differ greatly in style, they all display a clear talent.BUY THE ALBUM! Throw it in your car CD player and go for a ride!"
3,"It's okay, but not worth buying","Maybe I haven't let it grow on me enough, but I was expecting something amazing like when I first heard the White Stripes or the Strokes. Don't believe the hype. It's a very run of the mill album, with some catchy parts. The singer sometimes sounds like Cobain, but the songs are never as well crafted or as inspiring. Highly Evolved doesn't ever really get rockin' like the bands they're compared to. Still I think it has a possibility of being an album that grows on ya."
4,"a good, light, album but lacks any real punch","i actually listened to this album before it was ""officially"" released. i always buy the albums if i want to continue listening to them, and this was no exception. the vines managed to put together a very nice first release album. while the songs on it lack continuity and run across a broad spectrum of genres they are all enjoyable. highly evolved is probably the best album to come out of the so-called ""new wave"" of rock, a light, poppy album that should appeal to anyone that listens to rock music.however:despite what the media says the vines are NOT Nirvana. i have no idea where this idea came from. this is without a doubt new wave rock and has nowhere near the depth that a heavy hitter like Nirvana has. no one should be buying this album because they like Nirvana."
1,The Future of the death of Rock,"Allright, I gave this album one star to be nice, because I think they tried...I think. I dont get how people can say Get Free is a good song. The only decent song on this album is Outtatheway. This is not the future of rock, but a giant step back. First off, the lead singer needs to put down what ever it is he is on, and pick up his guitar, then learn to play it. Some singing classes could help too. I personally dont find it entertaining to see someone whacked off his mind trying to cause child like scenes and outbursts to sell records. I find it very sad, and I feel sorry for people that walk around with their album in a little cd wallet and argue that this is worth paying for..."
3,"The Vines : Fuss or No, get ready for some ass kickin rock!","The Vines may sound like Nirvana, but I like getting nostalgic. This album is so diverse that you might think Craig Nichols, lead singer, is a skitzo. Most of the songs have great riffs (Get Free) and sing along melodies (Factory), this is an astounding debut for a band that has a long way to go.Faves: Get Free, Factory, Homesick, Outathaway!,Highly Evolved.Un-Faves: Sunshinin', Autumn Shade, Mary Jane"
4,Promising Debut Album,"From the opening track, the Vines show you what they're all about. They band is hard, edgy yet melodic. Many overseas critics have have hailed them as nothing less than the second comming of Nirvana. This is mildly true. On tracks such as ""Outtatheway"", ""Highly Evolved"", and especially ""Get Free"", you can easily recognize the influence of the Seattle trio on the young Australian band. But don't be fooled, the Vines are no Nirvana cover band. ""Autumn Shade"" and ""Mary Jane"" are much softer and complex. Many of the songs on the record utilize a background acoustic guitar, a la Radiohead. Arguably the best track on Highly Evolved, ""1969"" projects a Britpop vibe which is very remaniscent to My Bloody Valentine.Overall, this debut record is a very good one which is only a shadow of what's to come. Keep your ears open for this band."
1,Less Than One Star,"My limited knowledge of astronomy and physics has left me with the understanding that a black hole is a star that has collapsed into itself. As a result, the black hole has negative mass. If that is the case, I think that Amazon should take a cue from the world of astronomy and allow buyers to rate recordings with negative stars, as they would be the rating equivalent of a black hole. Certainly, few recent recordings are more worthy of, oh say, -5 stars than ""Highly Evolved."" (Not to mention the fact that the title is an oxymoronic misnomer of the highest order.) ""Highly Devolved"" is more like it - like back to 1994.Please, oh please, do not carelessly lump The Vines in with The Strokes or The White Stripes. Julian & Company and Jack & Meg write and perform songs that are far superior, and The Hives run laps around these guys all day long.The Vines? Try The Withering Vines.Or maybe Silverchair II."
3,Not Quite the Rock You Thought,"After hearing their first two singles (Get Free and Outtathaway), one expects to be blown away with explosive rock comparable to that of Nirvana and Rage Against the Machine, though is hit more with a mellow garage rock with sudden bursts of high energy. Appropriately starting off the cd with Highly Evolved, one gets ready for an all out rock fest for the remaining time left in the album. However, moods change as the number one on your cd player changes to two. Though lacking nothing when it comes to soft rock, Autumn Shade is not the heavy sound so many of us bought the album for. Yes, Highly Evolved as a whole is moreso of an easy-listening-bedtime-story-rock, it hits you with such energetic hits as Get Free and Factory just frequently enough to make it worthy for one's collection."
1,horrible talentless nirvana/britpop ripoff,"This band honestly only has 2 or 3 songs on the album that are listenable and they rip so blatantly off nirvana its sad. Ripping off nirvana doesn't make you a visionary - it makes you silverchair. Half the rest of the songs on the album are slow rhythmless dirges lending a complete lack of cohesiveness to the album. The lyrics make litte or no sense and all the vocalist does is scream on the faster tracks or warble incomprehensibly on the slow tracks. The guitarist is trash and the bassist is worse. THe album sounds like it was recorded in my basement. THE most overhyped album of the year. Noone in this band has any musical talent. Rock is dead. If you want Rock 'N Roll with some balls buy ""Appetite for Destruction"" by Guns 'N Roses since that was the last real rock album that had coherent lyrics."
5,Believe the hype,"this alblum is great. i listen to it everyday and i like it more each time. everyone says its not as good as all the media has made it out to. It is. notice that all the reveiws that mention this say something along the lines of ""the vines are a good band but they aren't great"" and some ... about nirvana. who cares who the vines sound like, the music is great rock music. the only complaint i have is that the songs ""highly evolved"" and ""get free"" aren't more than 2 minutes long. If you like rock, but this, its worth the money."
3,"Beautiful, but take to heart the ""no lemon"" dish detergent","This set is gorgeous and study. I've had it for a few years now. However, take to heart when it says to not use ""lemon"" dish detergent. They were awesome, but then I used lemon detergent, and it darkened them. They're still lovely, but not the pretty shine they had. So defintely stay away from the lemon detergent."
4,A build up,This mix is one that builds slowly to climaxes rather than smacking you in the face right away. It may take some patience but I think after a short listen you'll come to appreciate it in its subtleties and understand that dance music can be complex and still fun.
1,Punishing Sounds,It's albums like this that lead people to conclude that electronica is a plague sent by gawd.
1,AWFUL,"I'm certainly glad I saw this movie BEFORE I took my grandchildren to see it. From the advertising on TV, it was perfect for small children - the animated mouse, etc. BUT, it is absolutely dreadful. It is a dark movie full of dreadful rats. You can't get past the rats to enjoy the mouse. I would NEVER take a child under 10 to see this movie. My grandchildren would have had nightmares and I can see why it is important to check out animated movies BEFORE I take my kiddos to see them. SAVE YOUR MONEY for a trip to your local zoo!"

4,Pretty good movie,"I bought this movie because my daughter had read the book. She told me the movie doesn't cover the entire book, but just a story from that book. That aside, I enjoyed it. The story was both depressing and uplifting at the same time, if you can believe that. I was also interested in the movie as a Harry Potter fan as Emma Watson (Hermione) provided the voice of the princess. Dustin Hoffman was Despereaux, which was fun too. I would recommend this movie."
3,cute movie but disappoints,"From the previews, I was expecting more out of this little movie that could. Despereaux is very cute and the animation is great. The story line could have done a little more to explore the characters."
5,WONDERFUL FOR ALL AGES!!!!,"The Tale of Despereaux is a wonderful movie for all ages.The art work is wonderful.Love,Love,Love it!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, but should be PG NOT G","As an adult, I would give this 3 stars. It is OK, but no where near on par with toy story, ratatouille, cars, etc. The movie also seemed to me that it should be PG and not G. It is rather dark and has lots of violence. Too much for young children. I watched it with my 2.5 year old, and needed to turn it off so that he would not get scared. I watched the rest later."
5,Tale of Despereaux,"I received the DVD for my sister in fabulous time and the dvd was in great condition. However, my sister wanted a full screen version and I do not think they ever made it. She is happy with the one she has and I'm glad I got it for her."
5,Wonderful Family Film,"The Tale of Despereaux is a great family movie. One which your entire family can watch, unlike most of the rude and crude filth produced by the powers that control Hollywood. The Hollywood that produces so-called PG movies with half naked women and language not really fit for children to hear.As for the film itself, it is pretty much true to the excellent children's book. Like another reviewer, I do recommend reading the book first."
2,the dvd is scratched and skips,"I am very disappointed in this purchase of the tale of despereaux as the seller said it was ""like new"" and the movie skips. I expected better."
3,Read the book!,Again ...the book was a million times better than the movie. If you had any sense you would encourage your children to read instead of watch tv. The movie changed events around and even added characters and to compare this story to another movie is silly since it was a book first. Read!!!
3,Hoped for better,"It's small, which is what I wanted. But the steel is thin. This thing pops and crackles like crazy on an electric stove as the steel heats up, even on medium. And the ""whistle"" is barely audible. I'll be keeping an eye out for something better."
5,The product was as described,"I was very happy with the product LACOSTE EAU DE TOILETTE Spray. It is comparable to what is sold in upscale stores in the mall.My son will be very happy with this for a stocking stuffer as he is almost out of this particular brand.The scent of this is fantastic for any man in your life, be it your husband, son or a boyfriend~"
4,7 Days in January,Competent history of first 7 days of Nordwend from the German point of view. Good maps.
2,just so-so.........,"I can only give this movie a so-so rating; even tho it was well-intentioned, it was really low budget(and a teensy bit on the CHEESEY side); very few special effects (being filmed in 1981 may be the reason); it was filmed mostly in the woods; and the only judgement God inflicted on mankind in this movie, I'm not even sure it was true to the Bible. (??)Oh well, they tried! Good effort, I guess. Jerry Houser is one of my all-time favorite actors, cause he's just so gosh-darn cutesie!"
4,typical new age,"this is your typical new age style album. Nothing innovative or ground breaking. Overall, a good above par work. Better then most. Just lacks the originality of a few other artists."
5,One of the best!! A must buy.,"I sneaked in the theater when this came out, and watched it then, and have been hooked ever since. You can read the history and details on the other reviews, but this is just a fun movie to watch. The best thing, it has many, totally separate plots throughout the movie. From getting rid of Frank, the Dentist ""fairy' tale, Hot Lips shower exposure, and the football game of course. I watch it very often. I got this one due to the 2 disc package. I have another dvd, and vhs as well."
3,"Excllent Movie, but rotten treatment","The movie and the features definately gets a 5 star rating. But the reason I am going for 3 stars is this, this is the third release for this movie. Face it, this package is a rehash of this product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB7/qid=1140458090/sr=1-12/ref=sr_1_12/103-0690481-8915815?s=dvd&v;=glance&n;=130I feel that Fox Home Video is trying to make money over rehashed releases.First, the Five-Star CollectionThen the single disc editionNow this?????I like the movie, but I am wondering why Fox is wanting to re-re-release this move. It doesn't make sense (unless if they are wanting money)."
3,disappointing,"I wanted to see MASH while I was in the Navy, but the military refused to provide the flick to the Seventh Fleet during my service in the late 60's. I finally saw the movie at a revival theater in L.A. in 1977. I was disappointed at its uneven humor and pointlessness. Still, it has many good scenes and is definitely worth watching.I think this is one of these cases where the TV adaptation is better than the movie and my expectations of the original movie were too great because of all the raving I'd heard about it."
5,Still a Favorite,"I was lucky enough to see this classic when it first came out in 1970. Ironically, I was stationed in Korea at the time! It was a treat to be in the movie theater on the 8th Army base in Seoul Korea and see those opening words ""And then, there was Korea!"" Predictably, the audience went wild. I guess it's nostalgia, but I still enjoy this movie immensely. The sharp, funny dialogue and the talented cast make this one of the best. The TV series doesn't hold a candle to it."
1,what waz this???!!!!,what waz this? waz it really considsum a movie? it makes no sense. daeres no ceneteral charcetsrs two watch. it makes no point. the charcetsrs r not likebale . this waz much better as a tv sit com from da few espicoscdes i see. watch the tv stuff instead........peace
5,M*A*S*H one of the best classic's out there,This movie is one of the best classic movies out there. Anyone that has ever watched the series on television needs to see the movie and see where it all started. The only actor to go from the movie to the series is Gary Burghoff (Radar). He is one of the most loveable people in the movie and series.
4,Classic Altman & anti-war film,"M*A*S*H has always been one of my favorite films since I saw it while in Vietnam. On the surface it is about the Korean War and can be generalized as an anit-war film, but it is really an anti-Vietnam War film that heaps distain on the rigid tunnel vision of the establishment and the seemingly mindless attitudes and actions of the military.The director's discussion is also interesting and reveals some insights into the production and politics of the making of the film"
2,"Great Movie, Horrible Transfer","One of the other reviewers noted heavy saturation of colors and an ""apparent softness"" throughout. ""Apparent"" doesn't even begin to describe it. On my 61"" DLP, this is like watching a movie shot through a foggy lens. I've seen sharper looking up-converted DVD's than this.Easily the worst Blu-ray transfer I've seen.A shame to see on such a classic movie."
2,Didn't like the commentary throughout the movie,"Maybe I just didn't see it when I purchased the movie, but I wasn't aware of the director's commentary throughout the movie. It really detracted from the presentation. Also his comments seemed almost off the cuff and didn't ahve a lot of forethought in them. At anyrate, it might have been my error, but whatever, the commentary was bad."
5,Cantan corridos,This is one of the best corridos of all time you just can't beat the Sparxs. I keep hearing those cantan corridos for three months straight. Leonardo
5,Good Start,I used these books as a singer and I now use them as a teacher. They are wonderful to use for the high school and lower level collegiate singer. As the singer progresses in skill they should move beyond these books but these are wonderful to use for the intermediate singer.
5,Outstanding book for 2 year old!,"When I first saw the book, I thought the mummies,witches and monsters might scare my 2 year old daughter. I was so wrong. She loved the rhyming, repetative words at the end of each page. ""Halloween's a time for spells, this witch makes strange things grow. But OOPS she's made her nose too long, OH OH OH!"" Long after Halloween was over (much to mom's chagrin) we still want the Halloween book. And she could recite it word for word to me, without my prompting her. She would bring it out at times other than bedtime and want to read it to me- or vice versa. The pop -ups were colorful and animated. I would recommend the Snappy series to all moms of toddlers. We had the Christmas and Snowtime versions last Christmas ( my daughter was 18 months) she would sit for half an hour as long as someone read them to her over and over. A great way to introduce kids to reading!"
2,Poor Product,"I bought this product a few months ago. It worked at the first 1-2 months, and then it did not stick together with skin any more. I was quite disappointed the quality of this tape."
3,For westerns junkies only,"A mining assayer (Edmond O'Brien) with a criminal past that haunts him joins forces with a miner (Edgar Buchanan) and his daughter (Yvonne De Carlo) to fight off a claim jumper (Barry Fitzgerald) and his henchman (Michael Moore). This rather ragged routine western, directed by Byron Haskin (THE NAKED JUNGLE), doesn't have much to offer though western junkies may find it agreeable. For the most part, it's the usual shoot 'em up but the most interesting aspect of it a subplot involving Richard Arlen as a man from O'Brien's past, now married to O'Brien's spoiled ex-fiancee (Kasey Rogers, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN). The barely suppressed marital tension between the two provides more conflict than the miners vs. claim jumpers plot. De Carlo is gorgeous in Technicolor but O'Brien needs a strong role to show off his acting talent. Without a good part, he's a cipher. With Gladys George and Myron Healey.The Olive DVD is a spiffy colorful transfer in the proper 1.33 aspect ratio."
5,very thorough,"This is a very thorough, comprehensive overview of the gifts of the Spirit and its workings. It taught me so much and helped me grow in my faith.Bennett backs up his teachings with Scriptural references throughout the book, which is also helpful"
3,It's better than the Artisan...but...,"It's better than the Artisan...but it is still just okay. I now have three kitchenaid stand mixers in my house. One classic 1958 model from my grandmother, one Artisan 4 quart I purchased in 2009, and this Pro 600 Series. I do a LOT of baking and grew up around a pastry chef. Unfortunately, the kitchenaid mixer is NOT what it use to be in terms of construction and durability. This particular mixer is far superb to the Artisan model (which had to be replaced and fixed twice), but I dare say that I should have bought the Viking or Cuisinart instead. It's loud and the whip/beater are not high quality. Is it worth $400+...no. Does it out perform my 1958 model...no. Does it work better than handmixing...yes. So it's just okay."
5,KitchenAid is the best,"I have decorated cakes for years, and always used my faithful KitchenAid 5-qt. I reluctantly gave it to my daughter so she'd have a good mixer, and upgraded to this one because of the larger capacity. KitchenAid is the BEST--never a disappointment."
5,"If you bake, this is it.",The power of this thing is awesome. I can make 2 loaves of bread at a time and it just rocks along and kneads it like its suppose to. Great
4,Much noisier than my older 325watt model. Works Great otherwise,"This mixer works fine. It is a couple of inches taller than the older artisan model we had (so it doesn't fit under the cabinets like the old one did). The noise level is considerably higher than the artisan model (this is a very loud appliance)! Lastly, I do not understand the design of the bowl raising & lowering rather than the top tilting. I liked the tilting head design more; the bowl was much simpler to attach then this design. Other than these complaints the mixer does work very well!"
3,Smaller is probably better.,"I watched how the foodnet work shows used this mixer and it looked so simple, quick and easy. Well it's not. The lift bowl gets in the way of taking on and off beater. The head does not lift like the smaller versions, it's heavy, and good luck getting a cover to fit. I ordered a cover for the 6 quart mixer and it still is about an inch too short. I think I would have been happier with the 5 quart artisian."
1,Very bad,"Device is very badNot deserve any one dollarNow is corrupt did not complete a month of his arrival to and had come to ruinI do not recommendIt is a waste of moneyThis my email for any questionpkhk400@hotmail.com&#1581;&#1606;&#1575;&#1606;KitchenAid KP26M1XWH Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, White"
1,it is a LIE !!!,"Do not believe the rebate deal. It's a lie. I never receive my $50 cash rebate, even though I know that they definitely receive my rebate information. The food mixer itself is just like other mixers, it is workable, no outstanding function. However, be careful to deal with those big companies, we consumers always could be take a advantage by them!!!"
5,Great Mixer at a Great Price,One of the best mixers ever made--Excellent prompt deliver. Best price I have seen anywhere. Blends well in our black and stainless kitchen
1,Replacing worm gear just over 1 yr old,Purchased mixer for Christmas last year. Make 3 loaves of bread 1 to 2 times a week. 3 loaves is max....and the worm gear finally destroyed itself. This is 2nd Kitchen Aide mixer and the assumption at time of purchase is this would be an upgrade from older smaller one. Despite marketing claims....no difference when it comes to bread.Looks like its time for a Bosch!
4,Check out the price spread on the colors,I had to replace my 600 because after it fell off the counter twice it wobbles and makes nasty noises. I do love the machine even though professionals bad mouth them in favor of other brands for mixing bread. I like the attachment sets and use everything from the grain mill to the pasta roller on a regular basis. As a mixer its kinda so-so. I also am a little disappointed that it can't survive a fall of the counter since the thing walks around a lot when its in heavy mixing mode....but the reason I wrote this review was the amazing price range. If you're willing to live with a butt ugly color (I am) you can save loads of money. I bought the copper for $275 whereas a lot of the popular colors are $400. That's one heck of a difference. But of course I used the savings on more attachments so all is right with the world (assuming the pasta extruder doesn't break like some of the reviews report).
2,"looks good but is certainly not ""professional""","Got this after burning out an Artisan. This Professional lasted 1.5 years being used once a week on bread etc. It basically will not hold up to any serious mixing requirement. To me ""professional"" means working most days with somewhat heavy loads... and this could not have lasted more than a month or two judging by the amount of use it got from us. When calling customer service the representative explained that certain loads could not be dealt with by this mixer... and yet it is called ""professional?"" We are going up to a Viking I think or maybe Vollrath. (a day later) Nope, we got the NEW Pro-line mixer from KitchenAid (see pro-line website) because it has 2x weight capacity AND a FULL Five year replacement warranty! Yes it was almost $700 but the bowl is, it seems, interchangeable, and compared to the 900-1400$ units from other makers this seems the best deal. As of 12/18/2012 Amazon does not seem to offer this high line yet."
2,If you cook alot it might not be for you,"I have had a professional 600 kitchenaid for about 5 or 6 years. I have now gone through 2 motors. It is noisy and vibrates on the counter. It gets hot. The whole kitchenaid machine will move with bread dough kneading. It simply doesn't have the power to do big jobs. I use mine 3-4 times a week for various things, mainly cooking for my family. Buy something that lasts longer and does a better job."
5,Love my KitchenAid,My husband and I have had nothing but Oster mixers in the 27 years we have been married. I am now a KitchenAid convert. This mixer is amazing. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves to bake.
1,My mixer broke too,"I purchased a kitchenaid 6 quart mixer and the plastic transmission housing broke. Unlike others who this happened to, Kitchenaid told me tough luck, it's out of warranty.One would think a professional grade mixer could mix bread dough with the supplied dough hook."
5,SWEEEET,if you buy this product is because you know is like having an extra pair of hands in your kitchen
5,Great item,"Love this mixer! Got it for Christmas from DH to upgrade from a lower model that was over twenty years old (that in itself is a product endorsement as it lasted that long). My old mixer was a dull gray and this cayenne pepper is so pretty that I keep it on the counter (see images in this product listing at the top).This machine is a workhorse - very powerful and can hold up to 12 cups of flour (8 whole wheat). The only thing is the attachments are burnished metal and need to be hand washed (paddle, whisk, dough hook)but it is a small price to pay for an object of art that I can leave on the counter."
5,Love this item,Great great mixer - I am sure it will last forever....I've already made twenty different kinds of cookies for the holidays with ease.
2,Unhappy,I used this mixer for about a year and a half and it never could handle making a two cup bread recipe. Shuts off and now I think the gears have gone out on it. I love this mixer but I am kind of dis-appointed.
3,KitchenAid 600 Series Mixer,"Great product, only problem was unaware of the 110V US power supply vs Australia's 240V power supply. Has created issues in getting it functional safely. Using a step down transformer to convert voltage to safe, usable levels."
2,So disappointed!,It broke down after 2 years and I was just told it will cost $125 to have it fixed. The quality is just not there anymore.
5,Worth the Extra's,"Large Bowl, power is worth the extra costs. Makes normal operating noise but what electric appliance doesn't? Makes large batches of bread dough handily. I'd easily make the same decision to buy this style Kitchen-Aid again. Tilt up or bowl lift...makes no difference to me either way."
5,Love! Love! Love! My Kitchenaid!,"I had a smaller Kitchenaid mixer for many years. I decided to upgrade. Wow! what a difference. The bigger bowl makes it easier to mix bread dough. No more dough climbing up the hook. And I love the slow start,keeps stuff from flying all over the place. The finish is so easy to clean. Just having all that power makes the job so much easier. I haven't baked bread in years, now that I have this mixer I bake once a week. And the bread is so much better than the store bought bread. No additives,or preservatives so much healthier. I LOVE this Kitchenaid it's worth every penny I paid for it."
2,A symbol of quality no more,"My wife has a KitchenAid UltaPower mixer that she bought 12 years ago. It is great, but she wanted more power & speed so we ordered this one. 15 minutes out of the carton and we packed it back up. This mixer is much larger and more powerful but feels lighter that the Ultrapower model and even unstable. The standard attachements are much lower quality. They feel like attachments for a toy mixer. Also, just the overall look and feel of the mixer feels like it was cheaply made. For example, raising and lowering the bowl is isn't smooth. It doesn't move over the rail like it should. The bowl itself also looked very poorly made and even had some small dents. This is still probably a good mixer, but it is not the symbol of quality these mixers were. We will stick with the old ultrapower."
5,new mixer!,"I already had a Kitchen Aid 3 1/2 quart mixer that I used at least 1-3 times a week. As I'm baking more, I wanted a mixer with the same motor (that can mix divinity without any whining) but that i can double or triple a recipe and still have it fit in the bowl. I love this one, even though it's a lot heavier and a bit bigger, but it's worth the loss in a bit of counter space."
1,price fluctuation,"i've been watching the price of the kitchenaid pro 600 for past 2 months.it started to raise its price close to the mothers day, and i believe its at its peak now.the difference is (at least from what i have observed) over $100,it used to be like $280. now it is over $380, which is more than 133% of what it used to be a month ago.what the ..?and different code name throws me off too. there is no description of what makes the last three letters different,just vague, uncertain postings floating online, does not help customers.what is justification of raising price this much without having an upgrade?"
4,No Substitute,"Bottom line, there is no substitute for a Kitchen Aid mixer, if you don't have one you need to get one. I'm very happy with mine but I will add that I don't think they quality control at Kitchen Aid is what it used to be; When I select a speed there is a slight delay before the motor starts, this is a little annoying as the units I've used in the past responded instantly, but I'll survive :)"
2,Did not meet my expectations,"I have always wanted a KitchenAid mixer because I had heard they were so awesome. However, when I finally broke down and got one, the mixer proved me wrong. I found that I had to constantly stop it to scrape the sides and it didn't ever get the stuff on the bottom unless I put it on a super high speed. However, when I put it on the high speed it caused the ingredients to start separating from themselves in which case I had to throw out what I was making. I have returned mine and do not intend on getting another one, as I had a friend tell me theirs does the same thing. If you have the patience to constantly scrape then go ahead, otherwise my $2 hand mixer does a better job."
3,Good Product,Wish there was a way to make a smaller bowl (adjust the size of the bowl) Otherwise it's wonderful
5,Kitchenaid Pro Mixer,"I am very happy with this product. The only thing I would object to is the ""busy-ness"" of the Webpage. It seemed that I had to go deeper and deeper to find what I wanted and sometimes it was difficult to find who was offering the best price. All and all, though I would order from them again."
5,Awesome Mixer,"I love this mixer! Plenty of power and very easy to use! Makes a bit of noise, but it has 575w, so it's to be expected!Cleans up easy and looks very nice on counter if that's where you keep it."
3,Gets the job done...,"Pro: The KitchenAid Professional 600 is great for hands-free mixing.Cons: This mixer requires constant stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl, which can be quite difficult depending on the attachments. Also, it is rather noisy, to the point that items baking while you are mixing may flop. I had this happen when mixing icing for cupcakes that were in the oven, using a recipe I have used for years without any problems. I highly recommend that you do not use this mixer while something is in the oven."
1,a piece of junk!!!!!,"I bought a kitchenAid stand mixer for light use at home to make cookies and now the machine is leaking oil. Apparently this is a common problem because if you search the internet about this machine leaking oil you will find several blogs where hundreds of people complain about it. Please do research about this machine before you buy it. By the way, my daughter just got one for xmast and hers is also leaking oil. Check out this site and you'll see how common this problem is and how the Kitchenaid company refuses to fix this problem. http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/kitchenaid_mixers.html"
5,kitchenaid mixer,I love my new kitchenaid mixer. I tested it out on Christmas goodies and it stood up to the test........wish all women could have one.
3,NICE LOOKING BUT DISAPPOINTMENT,We had the 5 qt for years and always wished the bowl was bigger. Finally got the 6 qt and gave the 5 qt to our daughter. The mixer looks very nice. The aluminum attachments pitted and left a residue in some things - can't understand why they would use aluminum in this day and age. Bought the white attachments on Ebay. The mixer is very noisy - sounds like an old motor on its' last legs. Blends and whips well but doesn't really hold any more than the 5 qt did.
1,"Just like Black and Decker, now a brand you can't trust","We got ours as a wedding present four years ago, and it's just died. We don't use it a whole lot and usually not for dough. It just failed to turn on this morning and looks like the motor is shot. Note that we have the newer version with the metal gears, but it's still trash. We liked it a lot when it worked, but you really ought to save your money and get something else, nobody is happy to get you a present that dies so quickly."
3,Kitchen aid pro 600 series,Its ok. I prefer my artisan kitchen aid better tho. Its much quieter and smoother. The pro its much louder and overheats on one batch of dough and the dough hook and mixing attachment hit the same spot of the bowl like a knicking sound and the bowl will jerk just a hair. I don't know if this is the way its supposed to work.
3,Not good for making regular dough,"This is my 3rd and most powerful KitchenAid mixer I bought . Previous two had broken. All were the same motor breakdown problem. If there is other better brand of same kind of mixer on the market, I'd change to buy it, click away.It looks like a powerful, durable machine. But it is not, even for home use. I use it mainly to make dough - 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of water. Even this will make it work hard. How do I know?After a while, it turns too hot to touch with speed 1 setting.And the mixing speed is not as constant as it started.And the light of room goes dim when it need more power from time to time.Since it's new, the heat of motor burns the paint of the mixer creating bad smell. I found a way to ease the issue. Just put a damp cloth covering the motor part and spray some water. This will decrease the heat and also cover up the paint burning smell."
2,Loud,The motor is very loud and clacking. So loud I will probably call kitchenAid to see if this is normal. I had a smaller version that was 10 years old and did not have any problems with it ever and it was not loud.
5,Great product,"I have owned Kitchen Aid 5 quart mixers since 1967 when my husband presented me with a 5 quart mixer for my birthday. I have owned several since that time and had coveted a 6 quart ever since they came on the market. I justified not getting one due to my age and the cost. However, when my daughter found the deal Amazon was offering, I could not resist. I have used it daily ever since it arrived and I have not been disappointed."
4,KitchenAid Professional 600 Series,"I've had the Professional 600 for about a month and have not yet put it through its paces mixing anything difficult. I've used it make mashed potatoes and a cake. I find it a bit cumbersome to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl. I'm not crazy about the bowl lift design either. It's messy when it comes time to remove the wire whip. Frankly, my 38 year old hand mixer did just as well with a lot less fuss. This is a huge mixer. As one review mentioned, it does not fit on a countertop with wall cabinets at standard height above. I had to clear a space in a tall lower cabinet to store it. Any time I want to use it, I'll be lugging it out and hoisting it up onto the counter. I'm a little sad that I used my Amazon points and gift certificates to make this purchase. Nothing really wrong with the mixer, I just think it's way more than I really need."
2,Beware of Beater AND Kitchenaid Helpline,"It's nice to have Kitchenaid. They are easy to use and they make baking a cake easy. With this specific unit, though, you have to beware of the attachments. They are covered in a substance that comes off in your food. I have had to dispose of quite a few batters because flecks of the ""protective coating"" have come off while I was mixing. To add insult, Kitchenaid assured me that they would send me another paddle, but didn't. I waited over two weeks and when I called them back, they disputed the fact that it was their product at fault. I think if you pay $360 for a product, you should be able to use it without purchasing another item to make it work properly. For that amount of money, my paddle should work! I am not a fan of Kitchenaid helpline. Don't trust them, always follow up."
4,"Great customer service, faulty machine","My refurbished pro 600 went kaput after 5 mos of mixing bread dough. KitchenAid ran out of the refurbished to replace my broken one and sent me a brand new pro 600 instead. That was beyond my expectations so return policy/customer service is great. But in 1 1/2 years, I had to return four (4) of these supposedly top of the line, professional duty. This machine CANNOT support bread making for very long. Like previous negative reviews, I think the plastic housing for the gears is the main problem. Needless to say, my original 4 qt classic mixer tolerated 13 years of constant bread making (and still going), but this heavy duty can barely make it into the 5th month. Its fine if it breaks within the warrantee time period, but if it waits until the year is over, you the buyer is out of luck.I'm really disappointed...I'd edit the stars to three if I could."
5,I love my new KitchenAid Mixer!,"I previously owned a 5 qt KitchenAid Mixer and it was great, but this one is HUGE! And so nice to use. I can make cinnamon rolls for a party in one batch! THE PRICE WAS AMAZINGLY GREAT WHEN I BOUGHT IT TOO!"
3,Living with this mixer,"I sent the first 600 Pro back to Kitchen Aid for replacement when it started to knock loudly after a single holiday season. I make bread in it, but no more than two loaves at a time. When I called the service department, the support gerbil told me, ""Say you're going to knead a batch of bread for 22 minutes....."" and other stupid things. Her advice for the replacement they were going to send me was to ""run it for 2 minutes, then rest for 10 minutes, then run it for 2 minutes, etc."" See what I mean? The replacement mixer hasn't begun to knock yet; however, it's like standing in a room with a jet engine winding up. My engineer husband assured me that once it was out of warranty he'd take it apart to add insulation to deaden the sound a little. Sadly, I gave my sturdy (quiet!) old classic KitchenAid mixer to my daughter...lucky girl."
2,Chinese made junk,"I've had my mixer for 3 years and have had numerous problems. I was making a batch of bread a week ago and the mixer got too hot and stopped in the middle of kneading my dough. It never would start again so I took it to a local small appliance repair person. He said the new mixers are ""junk"" and all the parts are made in China, but assembled in the US. He also told me that the new ones are nowhere near as good as the old US made models. Phooey on Kitchenaid! I won't be spending big bucks on another one."
3,Very noisy!,KITCHEN AID 6 qt PROFESSIONAL MIXER MERINGUE KP26M1XMRThe mixer works well with large recipes. It makes fast work out of a double batch of Chocolate Chip cookies. I don't like all the noise it makes. It sounds like something is wrong with it even though it seems to work fine.
4,OK but not as good as you think.,"I wanted a Kitchen Aid for a long time and when I decided to buy one I wanted the best I could afford. Hubby got this for me as a gift. It was the prize of my kitchen and immediately went on display. I really enjoy using it, but the size makes it difficult to use when making small boxed mixes or if you need to beat eggs.After having it about a year, the small plastic knob covering the speed lever became brittle and cracked, falling off. I contacted KA assuming I could buy a new one for a few cents and be done with it. Not only would they not sell me one, they advised me the entire machine would have to be disassembled and a new speed lever placed on the machine to fix it. In my opinion, they know this happens and are gouging their customers.So just FYI even though this seems a nicer mixer than the others out there, it may not be. Oh and the customer service sucks."
1,Broke after very light use,I bought this top of the line mixer at Macy's; I mostly use my Cuisinart so used it only a couple times a year for whipping cream or other tasks the Cuisinart doesn't excel at. Brought it out this Thanksgiving and it has broken down. Very disappointing!
4,"Love the Size, but not as powerful as my old Heavy Duty","I absolute love having the 6 QTs to work with, as I can do double of just about everything. I only wish they had boosted the power. I don't think it is as powerful as my old Kitchen Aide."
4,It's good (but not great),"Maybe I'm just a creature of old habits but I don't feel like this mixes as well as my old hand-held mixer, which I still have. I even bought the smaller 3-qt bowl/attachment to see if it would mix better for my smaller mixes but I still don't feel like it gets as thoroughly mixed. I will say that it does mix more QUICKLY, but who needs faster if it's not better? I have to stop the mixer frequently so that I can swipe down the sides with my spatula but this just slows me down.I'm still happy with my purchase..it just wasn't as amazing and life-changing as I thought owning my very first stand mixer will be. Maybe I'll update my review after using it for a few months and figure out my little mixer a bit better."
4,BIG KitchenAid Mixer,"The product arrived quickly and in good shape. It was beautiful and red. Unfortunately, it was too large to fit in the space I had for it, so I had to return it and exchange for a smaller one. This was quick and easy too and Amazon paid for the shipping both ways. Good job, Amazon. L. S."
5,Great product,"If you are in the kitchen alot, this mixer is a must. I have had a 4.5 qt. Artisan for 11 years and love it, but the large 6 qt capacity bowl made double batches of Christmas cookies a breeze. Nice to see that Kitchen Aid has not changed their quality. A must have!"
4,Steamer,"It was a gift. The receiver of the steam pot loves it. Had a small dent in the pot, but not enough to do any real damage. And that would be more of a shipping then a manufacturer problem."
5,Wattstax review,"I first seen this video at the theater in my home town. It was the 30th year anniversary release. It immediately grabbed my attention. I've never been amazed at such a group of great, talented, performers live on one platform. It is just simply amazing!"
3,Not Enough Music,"While the Stax catalogue is a treasure trove for any music fan, Wattstax the movie is more memorable for its kitsch value than anything else. Like so much from the 70's, this film has not aged well. For a music fan, it can be frustrating - while the comments of the residents of Watts (including a pre-Love Boat Ted Lange) are interesting at first, they tend to bore after a while. Furthermore, the interstitials of Richard Pryor do nothing to enhance his reputation as a comic genius.Some of the performances are good - the Staples Singers smoke through a version of ""Respect Yourself"", and Albert King is great, and the Bar-Kays are funk personified, but the schlocky ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" and ""The Funky Chicken"" are pretty poor choices from the Stax archives. Also, the grand finale shows Isaac Hayes to be a fairly average performer.But it is fun watching Rufus Thomas try to embarrass dancers back to their seats.A better idea would be to save your cash and buy a CD from the Stax vault."
3,Could have been better,This is a great film of a great concert but the DVD and the packaging could have been beefed up a bit. The booklet is pathetic. Check out the new Soul To Soul DVD for an example of how a treasured film should be preserved and packaged. It's a much better chronicle of that era with fiery performances and profound cultural exchange. A truly educational film.
4,I like Peggy even if Richard Rogers was pissed,"Peggy Lee recorded many fine albums over the years... and this CD gives a pretty good overview of her many talents. Hugh Shannon often told the story of when Peggy released her version of ""Lover"" she asked Richard Rogers how he like it. Mr Rogers replied, ""It's a waltz Peggy, it's a waltz!"" If you waltz right out and pickup a copy of ""Black Coffee"" I don't think you'll be pissed...I think you'll be pleased."
4,Beautiful....but watch out for teeth marks!,"My husband and I registered for this crib last year. We loved it in the beginning...we were creative with the solid back and put the bumper on the sides and front, and slid it BEHIND the crib in the back and attached it. Looked funny, but worked ok. We're both tall so the fact that the front didn't drop down was ok with us. But the big issue now is the teeth marks on the front railing. No crib guards will fit this crib. However I just called the manufacturer (got # from BRU)and they are sending me touch up paint for free! Hopefully, it will blend well and still look new!"
1,Never received item,"I have not received this item (over 2 weeks late and cannot track item or get seller to respond to my e-mails), and filed a claim with Amazon, and am hoping to get a reimbursement."
3,You can't review too much!,"Call me crazy, but I bought this book and two others on studying for CLEP before taking the test. This was a helpful guide, better than another I had used. I would recommend this book to others who need to review for the Human Growth and Development CLEP."
4,Hemingway he ain't,"or at least should not attempt to be. Kapuscinski's personal anecdotes are at once his strength and his weakness. Relating the mundane details of the residents of a hotel in Nigeria both makes the situation accessible, but trivializes the book at the same time.The main content is unassailable. The author's adventures and the misfortunes of the countries he reported on are fantastic. If the book had been kept a work of reportage, instead of trying to prove the author was a Great Writer, it would be unquestionably five stars."
3,"Good idea, but doesn't quite make the mark","I thought this would be a good idea to keep the counters clear. The plastic part that you store the soap is makes it feel a bit cheesy. It's ok, and mostly gets the job done, but would not buy it again."
4,looks nice,"product is held together by one very small screw, there should be more than one in the package and directions should tell you to put it a certain distance above the sink since there is not enough room to put it together with the soap in it unless you hang it way above the sink, it should screw together from the top, not the bottom."
5,Beautiful and space saver,"Great product. I have a pedestal sink and there isn't much room for a soap dispenser, this was a perfect solution. Easy to install and sturdy so far"
4,"OK, I Guess??","Looks Great but thats about it. Very large container, larger than expected but tolerable. The only negative is the pump top is a little wobbly but it works well. Lets see how long it lasts. Thank god it's for adult use only."
5,Changed my life in all the right ways,It had everything I had ever been looking for to change my life and turn it around for the better.
4,Excellent CD,"Like so many other listeners of this CD, I had never heard of Sia until I saw the heartbreaking finale of Six Feet Under on HBO. The musical selection for the ending of this show could not have been more inspired even if it had been written specifically for that sequence. The music was hauntingly beautiful, and a good amount of the rest of the songs on the CD are in the Sarah McLachlan vein, but without the wailing or desperate longingness in the voice. Here, the singer's melancholy is revealed through soft, but clever, lyrics, and a soft, hushed voice that seems to mask a lot of pain, suffering, and trials, but with enough hope and faith that there is still something good to sing about yet. Thankfully this is not a one good song CD, it is mature and confident, and will stand up to multiple plays over the years, I'm sure.Highly recommended as a good chillout album. ;)"
1,Don't offer it for sale if it's not available.....,"I ordered this CD, then received notice that it was not available and no additional copies would be arriving. Ended up getting it off Itunes, so that's the better way to go for stuff like this. I love the music, however!"
3,"A little slow and boring, but once known, worth the time.","Sia is hard to get attached to. Her music is slow, and not all that original. Her voice is what drew me in on the single, Sunday, but on most of her other tracks, she doesn't stretch it, and it gets kind of boring. On the whole though, once you get used to the melody (if they have one) of the songs, it becomes comforting to hear them. Almost like going home after working all day."
4,Ardell Lashes,I have been wearing lashes for a number of years and these are very easy to apply and are very durible.
4,luuuuuved it--great bed reading,I had never read any of Anne Lamott's other books--and in <head bowed> complete ignorance I had never even heard of her. But I LOVED this book! She made Jen (the main character) so real and I wished Jen had lived next door to me---except her scream therapy wouldnt have been so fun...<laughs>. I couldnt believe what other peoples reviews were saying (about not liking Hard Laughter)--I guess to each his or her own. Well I can say *I* enjoyed it very much-finished it in two days and cant wait to get my hands on Anne's other books.
2,eyes sore,"I have read 3 of Anne Lamott's books and was profoundly discouraged with this writing. Although I wanted so much to get to know the characters and enter in to their life, I couldn't get past their lack of nobility and/or dignity with the way they chose to live. And for a grown woman to have such a close relationship with a young girl in this novel? Totally inappropriate, especially in these fragile times.I work with college students and I want them to be inspired, championed, held accountable and victorious over the imperfection that life throws their way. I hated seeing life through the lens of this book; I don't know anyone like the characters in Hard Laughter in the 17 years I have worked in academia, and I hope I never do. It is one thing to write with raw authenticity that propels the reader to live with dignity, and something entirely different to read human mistake after human mistake after human mistake and never change the course of their trajectory. Very sad indeed."
4,Great Reference for Any Educator!,This has been a very helpful textbook for both my Capstone Course in my Education Specialist Program and for use as an Educator. It has some good articles brought right into the chapters. This is a recommended book for all professional Educators!
3,Great for a while - not a long life saw,"I use these saws everyday, but seldom for furniture work. When new they are great, just today I cut the corners for some skirt boards and it was the perfect tool. They die quickly though, under hard use. They bend easily when used in poor quality woods or carried in a backpack, and the teeth disappear too easily. Still, I bought two more."
5,fantastic saw,"This is a super little saw!!! I have yet to hand cut any dovetails with it, so I can't speak for it's intended purpose, but for a trim here, and a shave there, it is out of this world.The teeth are aggressive without being out of control, and the flexible body gets it anywhere. plus,it will fit in any toolbox, bag, or belt.I have replaced this saw twice, because I was foolish enough to loan it to other people who just had to have one, too. But, at the price, you can afford to give a couple away, keep one nice, and one for junk work, or use it to ut some ugly stuff once in awhile, if it's the best way to get in there.Great job with this one, but Irwin tools of lesser quality are few and far between. Keep up the quality."
3,Shines when not shiny,Strong final stretch (besides the unfortunate hider) reiterates just how refreshing this watered down incarnation's power-pop-prog prowess remained.
2,"Some Great Material, But The Majority Of It Is Boring","This CD is a typical ""get a few good songs and a lot of boring filler"" recording. If you can't write enough interesting songs to make up an entire CD, then don't release a CD with a lot of boring material. Great musicianship doesn't compensate for uninteresting/boring songs. It's sad to hear such talented musicians produce a CD with a bunch of (yawn) boring, forgetable songs."
1,Misguided,"1997 and Yes having re-established the classic line up fell prey to management foul ups yet again (a strong manager is what the band needed) and Wakeman, frustrated, called it a day for the second time. The album is a travesty of poor arranging, uninspired songs and added contribuions by Howe and Anderson far too late to save this from being a weak album. To me Yes im[loded in 1979 and have never got near former glories, even 90125 was an ok album saved by OOALH itself a riposte to Heat Of The Moment by ASIA. I've seen Yes severtal times, Anderson is rigfht to retire, the 35th Anniversary tour showed time has caught up with them, particularly Howe who hit so many bum notes at the Brighton Magnification show it was sad. The fire is all but out, don't buy this it is rubbish, go and get CTTE, Fragile, GFTO, these show up this album for the impostor it is."
2,"The Yes, Inc Machine Lays a Scrambled Egg","I am a longtime Yes-fan and bought this cd because Steve Howe was back where he belonged. Well. I suppose one can hear Steve's guitar through the cacaphony (sp?) of over-produced noise on this BUSY recording, but it could as well have been a computer doing it all. The album seems to have great energy and a ""freshness"", yet it is more of a caffeine/sugar-high kind of sound that took me nowhere fast. Yes sounds like a huge corporate power here, and that's not Yes for me. I sold the thing for four bucks to a used cd store. Oh well!"
1,Save your money..get The Ladder instead,"This was such a disappointing album that I really was afraid I had lost my beloved Yes, whom I have followed for 30 years. But then, BANG! The Ladder came out. Thank GOD, Yes is still here. It is truly amazing that the same group of guys can, after 30 years, produce one of their worst albums and then recover, and on the very next album, give us one of their best. You may want to buy both just to compare them. Unbelievable."
2,Not very engaging,"I've had this maybe around a year or so and have just listened to it twice. It's really hard to understand why. I love 90125 and some of their other stuff, but the album's songs are not very engaging. The songs are not bad, they just don't grab me. Well produced, but distant. Strange album."
2,What happened ?,"After the incredible studio songs of keys to Ascension Vol 1 and 2, we were waiting for something great to come out from their next cd.Surprise ! Maybe the worst Yes album since Tormato or Big Generator.Is the band out of inspiration ? Surely not, their next album, ""The ladder"" succeeded where ""Open your eyes"" failed, in the same style...The only good track is the opening one """"New state of Mind"", the rest is so-so....I am deceive but I forgive them, they haven't deceive me very often :)"
2,Should Have Been EARS,"A lot of Yes fans mercilessly thrashed this production, wondering where they were going with new members, guitarist/vocalist Billy Sherwood and keyboardist Igor Khoreshov. You have to understand that even a reborn band gets growing pains sometimes. Although a little lacking in divine inspiration, the songs bubble with energy and conviction. It is in their performance that this album finds its' salvation. Title track 'Open Your Eyes' is a powerhouse but it stumbles a little on its' own sheer business. 'Man On The Moon' is so different from ANY other Yes track and scores points for that very reason. 'Somehow, Someday' is a quality facsimile of something Trevor Rabin would pen. And the nicest moment of all is the plaintive 'From The Balcony', rendered only by Anderson's voice and Howe's acoustic guitar. Sometimes the best moments of Yes are the most simple. My actual rating is 2.5 stars."
1,Is Yes dead at last?,"With the exception of Close to the Edge (and perhaps Going for the One) Yes's best albums always featured new artists: Steve Howe on The Yes Album, Rick Wakeman on Fragile, Patrick Moraz on Relayer, Geoff Downs and Trevor Horn on Drama, and most importantly, Trevor Rabin with his pop sensibility on 90125. Whether this infusion was happenstance or by design, it was vital to the vibrancy of the music. While Rabin was never my favorite band member, his connection with the pop sound really made the eighty's band sound great. With Rabin's departure, it sounds like Yes is trying to capture his rock magic with with skills more suited to their older style. They need to forget Trevor and find some new blood to breath life back into the band. If they still love what they are doing they should go ahead, but it sounds to me like they are just going through the motions."
1,Bad pixel,"There is a pixel that is always lit (bright color). It should have been failed by the QA from the manufacturer, if it was shipped as a new product."
4,rollin in the rock,"Smokin, good old,straight ahead, madness. A great live act to see.Drivin with the top down kind of music. Purely summertime rollick.Lyrics are kind of sparse, but then again sometimes you need it to be, yeah. All in all, listen and run with it."
4,It works well.,"I bought this product hoping it would help eliminate the smell from 3 cat litter boxes. Even thought we change our cat litter boxes obsessively every day, we still had a nasty smell. This product works very well. However, it does not clean the air for an entire house, it works for a room or maybe two. And it is not quiet. There are two settings, one louder and more efficient. But even the lower setting is still noticeable when you walk into the room. It does clear the air very well, we run ours when we are not home so the noise does not bother us."
2,"Well built, but not really efficient","My first impression was great. A well built product, robust, definitely not flimsily. Yes, it is bigger than what I was expecting, but in a positive way (the only drawback can be the electrical socket. You need a firm one to hold the product hanged there in place).However, I was disappointed with its efficacy. It is not strong enough to eliminate the odors of rooms or bathrooms. Actually, it makes little difference even when at its maximum level (which makes a very loud noise). Therefore, after a couple of weeks, no one cares to turn it on anymore.It seemed a great idea, though. I was really hopeful when I saw it at Amazon."
1,First Landing Crashes,"Imagine NASA puts together a crew for a Mars mission. 5 People will go. Nasa selects Jerry Falwell, Susan Sontag, Alan Dershowitz, a Texan Geologist from the oil industry, and David Hackworth as commander. Thought NASA (or anyone else) would put more thought into crew selection? Me too.This book follows a trend in similar literature that focuses way too much on personal friction between crew members as the most serious problem in a mission like this. It achieves distinction only in how far the author will go in his stereotyping. From a religious fundamentalist continuously quoting the bible to fellow crew members to a Texan literally yelling Yee-Hah!, to a stiff necked military commander that...doesn't take charge?The shame of it is that the author is an acclaimed astronautical engineer that could have made this a very interesting examination of the latest theories in engineering a voyage such as this."
1,it's no wonder we're still Earthbound,I'm fairly forgiving when it comes to science fiction but this book exceeded my limits. I found myself hoping the entire crew would die a quick and painful death so I wouldn't have to read any more about them. Character development is obviously not one of Zubrin's skill sets. I'd offer that perhaps in time he'd be able to get it right but this one novel was enough of an agony to last me a lifetime. There's no way I'm willing to sit through another attempt in the hopes he'd eventually get it right. Save your money.
3,"Unpolished, sappy...but fun","""First Landing"" is Mars Society founder and rocket pioneer Robert Zubrin's first work of fiction, and it shows. His characters have the depth of cardboard, the dialogue is often hilariously stilted, and the prose is riddled with cliches and irrepressible sentimentality. But I really liked this book. For its failings, it has a page-turning premise and a taut, charged plot; I read ""First Landing"" in two sittings and enjoyed every moment of it. Zubrin's tale of a near-future mission to Mars contains some satisfying moments (including a believably cynical portrait of Washington politics) and not a little genuine excitement. ""First Landing"" isn't the sleekest Mars novel to roll out of the hangar, but it tells a good story, and Zubrin's enthusiasm is infectious."
3,Magazine review,"I selected an original collector's edition and was charged the $25 plus shipping. Howwever I received a worn used issue that should have been about $5.00, it has been so long since I ordered until Amazon asked for a review. It has lowered my confidence in Amazon in my receiving what I order."
4,Heavy Duty,"This replaces an old thin metel one I had. I have used it several times and it works great. Instructions call for heating chese in a separate pan and then transfer to the fondue pot. Using it for a beef fondue, instructions say put it on the stove. I could see no reason for the different treatment, so I did my cheese fondue heating it in the fondue pot on the stove. It worked just fine. Dish washes clean nicely. Very heavy unit."
2,Get what you pay for,"These microfiber clothes don't seem to actually pick up any dirt or dust (except in extreme cases). It looks and feels more like they simply push it around. I've been using them primarily as a cover for glass or plastic that I don't want scratched during transit.They're worth the price, if only for that purpose; if you actually need stuff cleaned, pick a different microfiber cloth."
3,Kachinas and Generals,"I already had a copy of the ""Sun and the Moon"" book and it is very good. I had listed the Eisenhower book for sale on my Alibris book seller site and somehow or other it was lost or I couldn't find it so needed to buy the copy to send to the customer who ordered it from me. Typical book of its type. Politicians and famous people and their lies and coverups."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful!,"I had seen Anuna on a PBS special, and was captivated by their gorgeous, haunting sound. In doing some research on the web, I found this early Christmas album by them, and had to get it. It's now my favorite Christmas CD; it barely left my CD player all season! In addition to some of the more traditional songs (albeit unusual versions of them), there are some more rare selections, like the Coventry Carol and the Wexford Carol. Their music brings me back to an ancient time and place, when people of the Earth lived life governed by the seasons and the land, and there was none of the crass commercialism of the holidays that we see today.This CD is a must for anyone who loves not only traditional Irish choral a cappella music, but more ancient sounding, non-traditional holiday songs."
3,WiFi phone?,There's an alternative firmware set for this device that can be used to create a mono-enabled system capable of VoIP via WiFi.
3,Zaurus 5500 PDA,"I was a Sharp Wizard user, so I was excited when they came out with a more sophisticated PDA. I was swayed by the price and the pull out keyboard unit. Since I purchased it in November 2003, I have not been able to sync anything but the address book and calendar. This is a waste to me. After several e-mails and phone calls to Sharp, I am considering chalking this up to a bad experience, and jumping out of the Sharp bandwagon and purchasing a Palm or IPAQ. I am truly disappointed with this product and pray that you do not make the same mistake."
3,Funny and entertaining,"So refreshingly light and fun. This film features Peter O'Toole, at his most charming, and Audrey Hepburn.Hepburn plays Nicole, the daughter of Charles Bonnet, a rich art collector and forger, that is about to get into a lot of trouble. He loaned his priced possession, a Cellini ""Venus"" (forged) to a museum, and the officials at the museum are sending in experts to determine the authenticity of the sculpture for insurance purposes. The problem? They will realize it is a fake and they stand to lose everything. So, her daughter teams up with a ""cat burglar"" to help steal the sculpture back. But O'Toole is really an inspector.Hilarity ensues when they go to steal the ""Venus"" so Nicole can save her father. This is a funny and charming movie. It is quite simple and very enjoyable. And Hugh Griffith as Charles Bonnet is very funny."
2,Good but with a fatal flaw.,"I bought this book in a used book store. It is a good dictionary, however it does not list noun genders in any way, making this book completely useless unless your source material indicates gender. This would have been a great dictionary but how such a huge flaw got through I don't understand."
5,"Finally, something a little different!!!!!!!!!!",I just can't wait for more from this guy. I hope he shortens his name.
2,Would Anderson Shut up for a moment?!,"The problem with this monstrosity is that Anderson won't shut up for a moment. Nothing musical happens here: There are no build-ups, breaks, endings etc that are in any way interesting, because Anderson just won't stop singing! (TRY ""OPEN YOUR EYES"" instead. A masterpiece of melodic Prog Rock which somehow combines old style Yes with 90125 style Yes brilliantly.)PS: The 'unhelpful' voters may want to know that I'm a big fan of Anderson's - see my ""Olias of Sunhillow"" review elsewhere."
4,SOLID EFFORT,"I guess all the Steve Howe fans are happy. It only took 4 efforts since Trevor Rabin left to make a great cd. I am a fan of all variations of Yes and it is time for the Rabin-bashers to realize that if were not for Rabin, Yes would have been done by 1985. ""90125"" put Yes back on the map after several sub-par efforts. Anyway, ""The Ladder"" is solid from start to finish. Standout tracks are ""Face To Face"", ""Homeworld"" & ""New Language."" By the way Yes fans, check out ""SCENES FROM A MEMORY"" by DREAM THEATER. The orchestration of their songs is Yes-like, but with an edge."
4,YES but No,"YES has climbed THE LADDER with their new release,but they have not reached the top of their game. This CD has reopened my eyes to YES, unlike their last effort. I can""t wait to see them again in Milwaukee next month.I hope they play Finally(especially the ending),and Homeworld.As a YES fan since the late '60's, I'll keep rocking with them. See you in Milwaukee."
2,Below average!,"YES is back, unfortunately it's not with a very strong effort. This album isn't poor by any means, however it isn't a gem either. Instrumentally the musicians, as always, are very tight (in other words outstanding, as per usual). Steve Howe has some of his best moments since the first ASIA album, Chris Squire puts on his typical brilliant performance, and Igor Khoroshev fills the keyboard spot nicely. The problems with this album are mostly lyrical. Some of the songs leave a YES fan to cry out to Trevor Rabin one thing ..... ""H...E...L...P!!!"" This album also has the worst moments from the band since the ABWH stuff done on the YES Union album. Lastly, the recording itself is also a little flat compared to Open Your Eyes and the 2 Keys albums."
2,"Yes, pero no es Yes, desde Montevideo, Uruguay.","Como fanático de Yes, compré el Ladder en Virgin Records en Broadway y mi primera impresión es que no es el Yes que todo fan espera. Mas allá de alguna melodía bien lograda de Howe y Squire, y los vocales de Anderson, falta la exhuberancia de la música de Wakeman que no han podido llenar Khoroshev y Sherwood. Excesivamente cantado (aunque abandonan los exasperantes coros perpetuos de ""Open Your Eyes""), no ha dejado lugar para demostrar el virtuosismo de Howe salvo en rarísimas excepciones. ""Homeworld"" y ""New Language"" quizas sean ""the best of the album"", pero están muy lejos del nivel de los 2 Keys to Ascension. La primacía en el tratamiento de los vocales por sobre las armonías y lo musical determinan que Ladder suene excesivamente lavado y pop, y no orquestal , sinfónico y musical como es el sonido ""Yes"". En resumen, mejor que el aburrido ""Open Your Eyes"", pero muy lejos del Yes clásico. Khoroshev y Sherwood: NO PLEASE."
4,"Again, good stuff.","Take each Yes album on its own, listening to them for their musical and compositional qualities (and not for an idealized 70s lineup which I also loved and miss), and this one will stand out as offering exceptionally good music."
2,"ANDERSON - Shut up for a moment, will you?","The problem with this monstrosity is that Anderson won't shut up for a moment. Nothing musical happens here: There are no build-ups, breaks, endings etc that are in any way interesting, because Anderson just won't stop singing! (TRY ""OPEN YOUR EYES"" instead. A masterpiece of melodic Prog Rock which somehow combines old style Yes with 90125 style Yes brilliantly.)"
4,"Great, Yet Flawed","Hmm, this is a good alblum, why Yes it is (ooh, a pun!). But in the great songs this alblum has there are serious flaws. 'Homeworld' is outstanding (now I want the game!), so is 'New Language' (that's what I'm listening to at this very minute, and for the next 9!). There are also some other neato songs. I do like the african-beat stuff, yet there is this obnoxious bass-thump, it's just to reminicent of a dance mix. I loved songs like 'Starship Troopers', that was outstanding (and I know it's impossible to follow that up), but the bass-thump deteriorates from that far-away feeling Yes represents to me. I really recomend this ablum, with the exception of the songs with the bass, which could/should have been so much better!"
5,Ladder Strikes Lightening,"Yes, known for dizzyingly complex music, has scored a direct hit with ""The Ladder"". Somewhat less esoteric than past efforts, this CD has one of my favorite YESSONGS of all time--""Lightening Strikes"". This tune begins with a most unusual flute and guitar intro and then explodes into a driving rhythm with a fantastic melody. The break contains a short but magnificent bass lick and Jon Anderson's voice takes a new, more intense quality. I have found myself playing this track over and over."
4,Give the guys a break,"Gee. Yes sounds like they're having fun on this one. I guess that's an oxymoron given the band's reputation for taking themselves rather seriously. But come on, Close to the Edge was 25 years ago (more or less) and does anyone expect the band to grow into a parody of themselves (as so many aging rockers do)?I do agree that Steve Howe is mostly noodling here, but I still can't take the CD out of my player. Vocally, these guys do not sound like they're pushing 50+, and I for one have no problem with a Yes album that I can do other things while listening to...maybe my attention span isn't what it was when I was in junior high."
1,Cliche,"Mixing and producing is almost as great as Trevor Horn did in earlier days. Sound approaches jon&vangelis which is great. The songs are too much a cliché, in fact more than ever has been. Although I think that there are some great chord progressions, and some lyrics are OK, this is only a shadow of the great music which Yes has made before (from Fragile to TFTO)."
2,"This album is good, Yes? No.","What has happened to Yes? One of the greatest, most original and creative bands I have ever heard have become producers of cheesy, bubble gum pop rock songs. The formulaic songs on The Ladder are dull, short-lived, and banal at best. The progressive song structures which have made Yes a famous band are mostly half-done or missing, the only decent song at all is the title song Homeworld/The Ladder. Even cheesy pop songs can have a certain charm at times - Owner of a Lonely Heart is still a favorite of mine - but the popish songs on this album are simply boring and empty. Yes is still great live, one should buy those albums instead of this one."
4,Great Reference & Resource for Artists,"I am an art licensing agent, and I use this book, along with a few other references, on a regular basis. It could probably be updated, like a previous reviewer stated, but it is still very helpful when determining royalty rates. It is good for an artist just starting to license, as it's easy to follow and is a great introduction into licensing art."
2,What a time I've had!,"This timer keeps time just fine. It's easy to set. And it is thoroughly FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have been using it for about 2 months now, and it has some interesting occurances. First, the magnet is intolerably weak. I got the timer, took it out of its box, and put it on the fridge. Fine. Then I used it. As soon as I touched a button(not even hard enough to set a number) it came crashing off the fridge. Pretty much that's the story. If you want to use it, you have to hold it in your hand.The other frustrating thing...It only times 100 minutes. That's fine if you're making cookies or a cake. But if you want to time your roast while its in the oven, it sure would be nice to have more time.*****Final Thoughts*****Find another timer. This one keeps time fine, but if you are going to invest in a digital timer, get one that keeps at least 10 hours.If you are going to buy a magnetic one, I suggest that you see it in person first to find out whether it sticks well."
1,Avoid This Timer,The first one I recieved worked for one day and then went completely dead. The replacement was also defective as part of the display did not show and I could not make any settings.Do NOT buy this timer
3,TIMERS,"USUALLY A GREAT TIMER BUT THIS BATCH SEEMS TO LOCK UP EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE WITH THE ALARM GOING OFF. YOU HAVE TO PHYSICALLY REMOVE THE BATTERY AND PUT IT BACK IN TO RESET IT, THE BUTTONS DO NOT DO IT."
1,Copy protection makes this program unusable,"At first, I was delighted to have this software. I love dictionaries and thought having one at my fingertips would be great. Then the program's copy protection kept demanding I place the original CD into the cd player over and over. I completely stopped using the program -- which is quite expensive -- because of this hassle. I am very sorry I purchased it."
3,What Social Classes Owe to Each Other,The book is accurate in asking the question that the title implies. It is a good persuasive argument.
4,"Guilt, irony and purpose","I think a couple of reviews, both pro- and anti- this book, have missed a point: life seems purposeless to this being: he spreads pain to others and himself, for decade after decade; as he does it the quality of his life gets lower and lower. Then finally in the camps of Nazi Germany, he gets to do something useful: from his perceptive he's making people better. There's something lyrical in his relief. Amis doesn't need to tell you what the Holocaust was like - other's have already told us. So in your mind there is a horrific ironic collision between the facts that you know and this being's relief and innocent delight; these two utter opposites between them project the horror this subject warrants. You as the reader are glad of that he's happy, thus inspiring guilt in yourself... Don't expect things on a plate from Mr Amis"
2,More than Vonnegut's concept..,"Everything about this book is reminiscent of Vonnegut. The concept, the subject, and even the writer's humorously clever and simplistic expressions."
4,Not breaking any new ground,"Sportbike Performance HandbookThe book covers mostly high level topics. Kevin Cameron will delve deep into discussions on old school or traditional technology that seems familiar to him. Examples include engine theory and carburetors. Anything modern gets a small blurb or mention. There really isn't a lot of solid information on newer technology to answer questions that plague many track day riders or motorcycle enthusiasts. Examples include, why should we consider Iridium or Platinum spark plugs, or how well does each type of brake pad formulation perform on the track/street. Granted, this book is still chock full of technical information but much of it is dated and dry.Overall: 4/5 stars, I didn't really learn anything new with this book, much of it is rehashed or can be related to automotive technology"
3,Its okay for a beginner / novice.,"This book covers most topics adequately, but if you already have some what a good understanding about the mechanics of a bike you would probably be better off trying to find something that isnt a swiss army knife. The book has over 22 chapters in under 200 pages, most topics are clearly cut out but go no further than a few paragraphs. If your thinking about getting a bike or have just got one and want to know more about what makes them tick, this is probably the ticket. However if you have a good idea then shoot for something that dives a little deeper."
5,Blue water,"It works great for me, very nice light or dark blue. I can't report on prevention of algae because I didn't know it was supposed to do that (guess I should have read the label).. Judging by the amount of algae I did get, I suspect it may not work that well, but I'll keep an eye on it. If it's outstanding, I'll update."
3,"Amazing skills, yet too busy for listening enjoyment","I can't believe how well John Bayless has mastered the piano. This is very obvious from the first song that you ever hear him play. I'd really like to watch him play in concert. However, the songs on this album are too much work for me to listen to. The music is so busy that I can hardly concentrate on the melody and it hardly gives me the peace I expect from traditional Christmas music. Some of my favorites for this category are Jim Brickman, David Huntsinger, and Tim Janis."
3,Love the movie.,I watched this on TV when it first came out. I am only disappointed that I could not find it on DVD as it is getting harder to find VHS players and copying it to DVD does not seem right.
2,Eats batteries and scrolls unexpectedly,"I love having the five mouse buttons and being wireless, but I've run into two problems with this mouse. First, it frequently scrolls down (as if the scroll wheel had been moved) a few lines all by itself, when I'm not even touching the mouse. Secondly, I have to replace the batteries roughly once per month. So, factor in the cost of 2 AA batteries per month when considering the price of this mouse..."
4,A Homoerotic Love Song to the American Cowboy,"The thinly-disguised passion of the anonymous male narrator for the eponymous hero of The Virginian makes this book one of the great underground homosexual love-stories of all time. If Wister's hero had only had the sense to give up his rather unconvincing romance with the frosty, insubstantial little schoolmarm, and turn to the one who loved and understood him as no other, literary history would have been changed utterly....Certain scenes, such as the Virginian's digesting of huge doses of nineteenth-century literature and Shakespeare at the behest of his fiancee, are fraught with unintentional hilarity. One wishes the duel with Trampas hadn't ended the book before the reader could learn what the cowboy critic thought of The Brothers Karamazov (or Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford, for that matter.)"
3,cigar cutter,item as described. took much longer than i expected to arrive. next time i'll just buy locally as opposed to something being shipped from overseas.
4,If I could get it to work...,"These type of games will make your computer run slow, so you have to have a good processor for it, which I apparently did not, it made my mac run super slow and it kept freezing up and taking forever to load. I love Roller Coaster Tycoon in general though, one of my all time favorite games, I wish I could have gotten it to work for my Mac... I'll just have to keep playing the original old game on my PC!"
4,"Good, but not great on a Kindle 3G","I am sure this is a wonderful paper Bible with John's commentary built in. I wanted a Bible for my Kindle 3G. Unfortunately, unless you are just reading through the Bible, navigating through is on the Kindle 3G (B&W with keyboard) is difficult at best."
4,Finally a Quality Edition of a Classic,"Then NKJV Macarthur contains all the study helps expected in a good study Bible. Book Introductions, study notes, summary of doctrine, concordance, maps etc. Particularly helpful is the Character of Genuine Saving Faith.In the past, all NKJV Macarthurs were glue bound even in expensive leather editions. This has been corrected by Nelson Publishers who now have sewn bindings on their hard cover editions and ""LeatherSoft"" Editions which have very flexible, attractive covers.Macarthur's notes are thorough and he doesn't hide from controversial issues. While there may be occasional areas where a person might disagree with Macarthur, his viewpoints are always well researched and generally sound.I recommend this product highly and appreciate that it now comes with a sewn binding - it is my ""go to"" Bible!"
3,needs Kindle tech improvement,"I have given this a 3 star because of the kindle tech issues. This is not very user friendly. In order to go to an initial passage, you go to the table of contents, then you still have to go to the next page, scroll down, to get to ""Old Testament"" or ""New Testament"", and then go to the particular book you want to get to. Also once you get to the chapter selection, there is no option to go to a particular verse.When you get to the book and chapter of the Bible that you are searching for, you cannot use the 5-way control to skip to the next chapter, you just have to keep changing to the next page, which is time consuming.This is not what you want to take with you to church, especially if there is a lot of scripture searching----it is just too time consuming to keep up.Other than the tech issues, it is the MacArthur commentary that is helpful for a study Bible. That hasn't changed. This just isn't user friendly on the Kindle."
2,Personal size bible???,I thought this was similar to a bible I saw in a book store. This one was much smaller with print too small for me. I guess that's what personal size means. You couldn't tell from the picture or description that the bible and the print would be small. I guess they should have stated the dimensions of the book and that would have helped some. I sent it back.
1,Very Disappointed,"I love the way John MacArthur teaches God's Word, and was excited to get this. But this Bible is unusable for deep, inductive study because the pages do not identify where you are in the Bible. If I'm missing something please let me know. I'd be happy with just the name of the Bible book on each page. I would like a refund, please."
1,Commentary is largely unsubstantiated opinion,Macarthur seems to expect us to follow his interpretation of the Word simply because he... says so! Perhaps a bit more research and prayer is needed first Macarthur.
5,A must have!,This is the best study bible on the market. It is also one of the cheapest. John MacArthur is one of the best teachers of our generation and he has poured his years of study into this verse-by-verse commentary on the scriptures. The teachings are sound and simple to understand. Get this book.
5,My favorite study bible,"I have been through many translations and many versions of study bibles. The MacArthur NKJ study bible is by far my favorite. I actually recently ""upgraded' to the ipad version, but still keep the print copy around the house just in case."
4,Good price,I bought this to replace the Aqueon bulb. Everything in the tank looked the same. I'm not sure about lifespan. It was a good price & packaged well
2,Should have listened,"I bought this bulb on a whim because mine unexpectedly reached the end of its lifespan. I read the reviews on this, some of which are good and some of which are bad. Well I was hoping the bad were people nitpicking. I was wrong and they were right. This light puts off a horrible green/yellow glow. My tank always looks dirty even though it is clean. Don't let the cheap price lure you in because these lights really are horrible."
4,Decent,"I think I bought this product for less than 5 dollars. I bought it to go on my desk at work and because it looked cute. It worked perfectly for a long while. I made the unfortunate decision to bring it camping with me and my neices blew the speakers out. That being said I would not play it continuously on full blast, but I am sure that is true of most speaker systems. You definitely get your moneys worth and it is perfect for young girls as my neices loved it and I ended up buying some for them. Decent product for the money."
5,Owen & Mzee: A heartwarming story with a lovely lesson,"This book is masterfully designed with stunning pictures to accompany thetrue story, a heartwarming story sure to delight both the young and the old. It was my favorite Christmas gift that I gave this year."
5,Wonderful story,"This book was soooo sweet. It's lovely to finally know the whole story behind the popular internet photo that circulated for so long. It it chock full of amazing pictures of these friends and is also educational, explaining some geography and animal behavior. I highly recommend it for all ages. I bought it for my husband and he loved it as much as our 7 year old!"
2,"A one pass wonder, worthy of the recycling bin.","The story is nice, actually a marvel, however the storytelling is little more than the quality of a not so astutely written newspaper column.That the two animals bonded is nice, but we see that in nature videos. The photographs are nice but they're nothing to rave about."
5,Beautiful pictures and a moving story,"This excellent account of the true story of Owen and Mzee will delight any young reader. The beautiful pictures of the animals and the park are perfectly complemented by the easy-to-read text making this book a wonderful story-time resource. Though young readers may be saddened when Owen loses his mother, his adoption by Mzee will soothe any lingering concerns while teaching a powerful lesson about acceptance. This book would be an inspiring addition to any family library."
5,"Compelling, moving and informative","This is a very moving book, but also a very informative one. The author, an American journalist, shows how varied the Jewish response to and experience of fascism was in Italy. At one extreme there were Jews who joined the fascist party (and were welcomed into it) at the other extreme there were Jews fighting with the partisans. By describing what happened to five different families, this beautifully written book grips you like a novel and leaves you gasping at man's inhumanity and humanity to his fellow man."
5,fascinating and well documented,"One of the best books in its category of historicaldocumentation. The author has deeply research the topic, has beenfaithfull to historical facts with an unbiased approach."
3,"A Bit Too Sensitive and Fey for Me, Thanks","Nothing wrong with this CD, it's plenty listenable and even enjoyable. But after ten or so cuts I got tired of the same mood blend of guitar, bass and reverb, the same vocals floating just behind the instrumentations so that the lyrics were steadily elusive (lyrics not included in the liner notes). Cut loose, gimme some noise, guys, or at least a different style of soft. If I were a college sophomore who'd just been dumped by my girl or boyfriend, I'd probably want to curl up under the covers all day with this CD, but I'm not and I don't."
4,Animal Rescues,"I don't know if I would recommend this book to you-Ten True Animal Rescues. That is, if you like animals. You would love these storis if you don't like animals.Could you imagine a hamster saving your life? That's what i call AMAZING! Also could you imagine having dog save your life?As I started reading this book , it was very interesting. When I got last few chapters it wasnt as good as the beginning was.So it is really up to you. It all depends on if you like animals-that's the biggest thing you should think about before you read this book."
5,Start understanding what's really going on..,"If you're public health professional, a teacher, a social worker, or even a politician, dealing with teen pregnancy at any level, you don't really understand what's going on, unless you've walked the walk, or read Kristin Luker's Dubious Conceptions, Judith Musick's Young, Poor and Pregnant, or Norine Johnson et al's (Eds.) Beyond Appearance: A New Look at Adolescent Girls. If you haven't been in their (adolescent mothers') shoes, but you have the social conscience and sense of social justice to want to help these kids, these three works are, in my view, indispensible reading. If you depend on organizations like The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy for your good ideas, you have really been missing the boat. Come down to earth and discover their real world."
5,LOVE this movie!,"I was in Italy when this movie was debuted at cinemas! I saw the movie even though I understand only a little Italian. The scenery was beautiful and the premise of the movie was not too hard to follow, despite the language issues! My DVD player was de-coded and now accepts all regions of DVD's. I have recently purchased this DVD and look forward to seeing the sights of Santorini all over again and the memories it will bring back to me. I wish this movie would be offered to all regions- especially those in region ONE. Americans would LOVE this move as much as I do!"
1,Did Not Emulate Miss Alice Harris Houston,"Carroll Leatherman even invents facts about my cousin, Tunkie, according to Lila Saunders. This is not a book to be honored. It reflects what Walker Percy called the worst of ""old white ladies fiction."" Could she not at least have comprehended that her portrayal, or betrayal, of ""Wink"" was condescending to say the least? However, don't ask me, just ask the staff at the Memphis Country Club how she treats them. She is hardly a lady but a woman who married up in oder to get money. Sweetheart, you really are not that different than Sandra, though you are much better than her. Miles above because you did write daddy when momma died. No matter how much you denigrated Miss Alice's father in your gossipy book.Well, at least you had descendants who married into the Carr family ... And Lord, can you put on a show!!!!!!!!!! Hope the doctors in Memphis take better care of you than they did my mother."
1,"This is not effective (i.e., doesn't work AT ALL)","Tried several cans of this cr*p (only because Home Depot and Lowe's no longer carry my favorite RAID Wasp and Hornet killer) and it works NOT at all. Went back to RAID when I found it... and RAID Wasp and Hornet Killer is still the BEST on the planet - will knock a wasp or yellow jacket out of the air, straight down with no flyaway. Don't waste your money on this Johnson crap.But why, oh why, is my Amazon page showing the Raid can for the Johnson SC Wasp/Hornet Killer?"
1,Worthless!,"Claims to kill fleas. My cats brought some in just as we went on vacation. Upon our return, fleas were all over. We tried all the J&J flea killers. All worthless. By worthless I mean the fleas treated the pooling RAID products as a swimming pool, splashing around for apparent fun. When they got tired, they hopped away. We brought back the empty cans and demanded a refund."
3,Bad Cuality,"Europe for me has been my favorite band since ive whas a little boy. The funny thing is that they comes from Sweden, the same country that I whas born.But I can only give this dvd 3 stars. It is a very good live-show. The reason way I can?t give this dvd 5 stars is because of the bad cuality. I thought that the cuality whas good because the dvd whas nominated for the best dvd in Italy. But I whas disapointed.Too bad that I missed the show in Sundsvall, Sweden."
4,almost a 10,"This is a very good depiction of the life of NAdia. I was a gymnast for 10 years...and NAdia was one of my inspirations. I know her back ground-like the back of my hand. And true to film form, this flick leaves some gaps in her real story, and over dramatizes her issues. If one is seeking a bio of this kid-get the book. If just want entertainment-this is a 10~~~~"
4,a piece of childhood,"This movie is a great memory from childhood and I hope it's soon rereleased.Although the movie is not true to every detail of Nadia's life, it's inspiring to watch dreams become reality, and that's why I enjoyed the movie so much when I was a kid in beginning gymnastics."
5,Nadia: The Beinnings of an Olympic Champion,"I loved this movie when I was a little girl, and have been trying to track it down since the neighbor who owned it moved away when I was 10 years old. This movie traces Nadia's career in gymnastics, starting from the moment she was discovered in the schoolyard by Bela Caroli when she was only 5 or 6 years old. We learn of the difficulties Nadia encounters, as her life is slowly taken over by the sport in many ways. However, we also witness all of her victories, starting with the competition where she was chosen to represent her country and first stole the spotlight from the other young gymnasts. The movie follows Nadia's life up to the Olympics, and the gymnastics scenes are all intercut with scenes from Nadia's real performances.I believe that anybody who loves gymnastics will really enjoy this movie. I really hope that it will be rereleased on VHS because I can't wait to buy a copy of my own!"
3,"Definitely a cheesy movie, but I loved the story of Nadia",A movie I saw when I was a kid and fell in love with gymnastics. Clean and (if real events transpired) a little sad at how athletes in foreign countries were/are treated as commodities.
3,"I, Jedi Wannabe","Luke Skywalker tells his own story in this short, enjoyable ""young readers"" tale. Imagine A New Hope told in the form of ""personal logs"" from Star Trek and you'll have the idea. John Peel draws on such diverse materials as the radio show and the old Marvel comics to flesh out Luke's story, and takes some minor liberties with the movie itself. When all is said and done, we are presented with a Luke who must all at once deal with painful loss and grow up more quickly than anyone should have to. While this one is not as good as Princess Leia's journal, it is nevertheless worth the hour it will take to read."
3,Not a real story.... to much fiction....,"Is a good movie but not a true story, there is too much fiction and exageration of the real facts. If you have not been in the country or a neighboring country you may believe what is shown on this film. There were human right abuses from the Armed Forces and the FMLN. Some of them were shown on the film but in an exagerated way just to make the film more interesting or more dramatic. The film is OK to watch but do not believe everything you see on it, the facts did not happen in that way."
1,Thumbs down,I found it full of stereotypes and did not like it at all. I would not recommend anybody to watch this movie.
3,"FREEDOM Dorsal PF Night Splint, Large","The item really does not seem to work to relieve my heel spur pain, I thought it would by stretching the foot tendon while worn overnight, it just doesn't seem to do that. So I will look for another product to help."
5,Miles Davis would have been proud!!,"OH, MY FREAKIN' LORD!--This IS the ""Bitches Brew"" for the 21st Century!!!'nuff SAID!except: to any MILES fan out there, just buy it, and take off to the cosmos!!"
1,Shows no artistic growth - Jenny One-Note,"Alanis Morrissette's original ""Jagged Little Pill"" was one of the biggest-selling debut albums of all time, and paved the way for a generation of self-absorbed and whiney brat rockers (Avril Lavigne comes to mind). ""You Oughta' Know"" is still one of the greatest exclamations of rage by a scorned woman, but the acoustic version on this album doesn't have the emotional weight of the original. Actually, she should have sung it accapella, as she had done in concert (most famously at the Kennedy Center with President Bill Clinton in the audience). Listening to ""Ironic"" reminds me that Morrissette misunderstands the meaning of the word. Overall, though, this album is a sad indication that Morrissette has not grown artistically in 10 years, and somehow has to rehash her best-selling debut album to rescuscitate her spiraling career."
1,THE ORIGINAL FROM 1996 IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!,"ALANIS MORISSETTE SHOULD JUST LEAVE JAGGED LITTLE PILL ALONE.IT IS NOW A DECADE OLD IF SHE WANTED TO MAKE AN ACOUSTIC VERSION.SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT A YEAR AFTER THE ORIGINAL NOT 10 YEARS AFTER.I THINK THE RECORD COMPANY MADE HER DO THIS.BECAUSE ALL OF HER CD'S AFTER JAGGED LITTLE PILL DID NOT SELL EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT THAT DID.AND NOW THEY ARE MAKEING UP FOR THERE LOSS.SHE DID NOT DO THIS FOR THE FANS DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.SHE DID THIS TO MAKE SOME $MONEY$ AND THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.""LEAVE A CLASSIC ALONE"".DO YOU SEE ""BON~JOVI"" DOING {SLIPPERY WHEN WET} AGAIN? NO!DO YOU SEE ""PRINCE"" DOING {PURPLE RAIN} AGAIN? NO!DO YOU SEE ""MADONNA"" DOING {LIKE A VIRGIN} AGAIN? NO!GET MY POINT !HEY ALANIS! HERE IS AN IDEA MAKE A [NEW ALBUM]!!!!!{TONY~TONI~TON`E}[ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999]"
2,My wife loves this... I don't,"She's got a good range in her vocals, but gosh! all those annoying affects to her voice drive me up the wall. Maybe it's sincere expression, but is it a Canadian thing? It's the thing she does at the tail end of her phrases. UUUUGGGGGHHHH!!!! Plus, her lyrics are BOOTY. Also, her song ""Isn't It Ironic"" is more a series of inconveniences than relating to the true definition if irony. She has to know this... she's a smart woman. Most of these songs have the rhythm section plodding away in the worst way. I gotta stop here"
3,Jagged Little Accoustic Style,"I am a huge fan of Alanis Morissette so naturally I had to listen to this accoustic version of her finest album. My review is very simmilar to another man's review in relations to which songs sound better, worse or the same. ""You Ourghta Know"" unfortunatley does not work sung more as a ballad, it simply goes against the whole purpose of the song's meaning to be in your face and kick ass. ""Perfect"" is very simmilar to the original but I do like some of the verses sung better on this version. In closing if you are an Alanis fan I suppose it's worth listening to but if you are not a big fan there is no point in listening to this album. What the fans really want is for Alanis to come out with some new material, apart from this album, she has now released her collection cd with old stuff and her new song ""Crazy"" is a cover from Seal, which is a horrible version of the song in my opinion anyhow. I hope we haven't heard the last of any new and original Alanis work."
4,"It's fine, but I had to do some adjustments","This knob is fine, only my wife didn't like it... you can install it easily and fast, but there's a little observation I had to use some glue to keep it really fixed"
3,"Great questions, bad software","I agree with other reviewers, the questions are very nice, good explanations and fair difficulty level. The software makes you repeat questions lots of times, you can't review the ones you got right on test mode, so if you were lucky with your answer, you will never know why. My software also failed a couple of times making me quit in the middle of test review."
3,Basie's Yesteryears,"This is a variety of long ago band voicing that at one time was rated tops. Lester Young did some marvelous stuff, and that is what made the album for me."
2,CD-Three Coins in a Fountain,"This is one of my favorite movies, however, about half way through the movie there was a skip in the CD. I had to fast forward to get past this point and missed that part of the movie."
4,Love this movie,This movie is one of my all time favorites and I'm glad I now haveit on DVD to watch whenever I want. They don't make movies likethis anymore
2,Gun doesn't drip... it pours,"This glue gun seems to be sturdy and is very comfortable, however, the glue runs out of the tip non stop. My personal use for it requires that it dispense very small amounts of glue at a time, and glue was everywhere by the time I was done. Within one hour there was a glob of glue on my stand I use the size of ping pong ball."
1,they don't last,"I've had 2 of these, both dripped like mad and one never applied glue smoothly. Both of them broke internally so the trigger no longer works after a few weeks. If you need a gun that you plan to use, buy something else. If you want a gun to look good and you plan to use it very little, this might be the one for you. I won't get another one."
2,Not For Me,"Great quality fabric and construction but very uncomfortable to wear, which is most important. There are far better values in boxer briefs available."
4,One for my collection,This dvd was a good purchase. I enjoy jazz of different types. This is one that i am pleased with and have added it to my collection.
4,monsters in culture and everywhere,"Ever since i was small, i could never get enough information on ghosts, hauntings and the supernatural. This book highlights, has accounts and reports of different creatures, visitations and presences all over the U.S. from old times to the modern...very cool...from shadow people and were-wolves to flying human-bird people -- very cool from each environment they have been reported from...and from a very famous author who takes you into their shoes as if you are staring at or facing the creatures themselves...very cool."
2,encyclopaedia,if you like reading encyclopedia's this book is for you.I was hoping more for just true ghost stories so i was let down! I did not care for this at all!
3,This is an average introduction to SAS statistics...,"The authors covered many topics in applied statistics, but they didn't mention anything about time series analysis. I am disappointed after reading this book. The biggest problem with this book is that it's overly simplistic - typically only one technique is illustrated for each topic - for example, in cluster analysis, only hierarchical clustering was mentioned and there was nothing about partitional algorithm. The authors only used very small datasets, which ignored the biggest power of SAS, the ability to handle large datasets. The authors also printed all raw datasets in the book, which took quite a bit of space.The authors should read Venables and Ripley's Modern Applied Statistics with SPlus first. Venables/Ripley made a great example on how to write an applied statistics book using a specific software."
1,The Debutante's Ball,"This book is unbelievably inane and self-serving. Ms. Pirro should stick to political pandering around the courthouse and leave the literary arena to others more worthy. If, however, she is she is still determined to write a lousy book, she should at least do her own writing rather than use a ""co-author"". Please don't waste your precious time on this book.PM"
5,Darn good propaganda if it is...,"This was a very good short-intermediate length book, and it seems to have started lots of discussion - her name recognition in far-away places like Canada, California, and the Midwest seems to be huge, at least for a holder of a county office."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DEADWARE !,"Ever since Adobe bought out this small operation, customer service has been severely lacking. Software will NOT work on Excel 2007. The promise for additional POWERLOOKS has become dead. Granted that the program makes presentation more interesting, the Powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website. This is highly disappointing as I purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the Powerlook templates."
1,Awful!,"This disc was such a disappointment. The musical interpretations were milk-toast, and the audio quality was even worse. This was supposed to be a musical journey of France. Ha! Mostly what you get is wavy water and grazing donkeys. Save your $10 and do not buy this DVD. Judging by this, I suspect all of the Musical Journey DVD's will not match up to anyone's expectations."
2,Short life,"No problem with the seller, but this is a piece of junk!! Worked for about a month. Finally after trying to fix it several times I threw it away."
2,"Going, going, gone!","We've had this 2 years, and in that time it's crushed about 9 full sized garbage bags of cans. Time to replace it.Don't get too personally attached to that wire framed can stacker. Ours detatched after about 3 bags full, leaving an effective single can crusher. After 6 more bags full of cans, we've lost the crusher today. The metal moving parts are too bent out of shape. That's about 75 bucks worth of cans it's gone through."
4,Multi Can Crusher,AS others have said it works good but the cans don't drop correctly. I either have to keep a finger on the next can to drop into the smasher or it will 8 times out of 10 crush incorrectly and then get caught in the smasher causing a malfunction which requires all cans to be removed and then fight to get the incorrectly smashed can out. Must be mounted on a wall that has a good stud to screw into. If not in a good stud it will most likely pull back out of the wall.
2,Does work to good,"Does the Job, but is hard to use and the cans don't stay in line. This takes more time and energy and just stepping on cans."
5,On Point MCs!!!!,I just love this crew!!!! They know and feel what they are doin'. Capital D is as sick as they come.... The rest of the crew complement him with their realness and passion shown in the whole album. If you are Hip-Hop....you know what to do.
4,A must-have,"A near classic. Stellar, return of the avengers, Queens get the money, are all dope songs that aged very well. Like on many hiphop albums, there's a bit of what feels like filler material. This prevents the album from becoming a classic that makes you want to press play again when the album is over (it's 74 min long). Still, even the filler material is listenable. My original cd was scratched and I bought it again. I guess it's always a good sign when someone really wants to keep an album in his collection."
4,GREAT MUSIC!!,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND VALIS.BOTH THIS FIRST CD AND THERE LATEST VAST ACTIVE LIVING INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM ARE EXCELLENT.VERY HEAVYAND SPACEY TUNES.BEST MUSIC I HAVE HEARD SINCE EARLIER HAWKWIND DAYS.
3,Euro-Style Rhyme,"Love the title track - hard, dance-able, live. I recall this way back when it came out and loved it. Also enjoy the collaboration with the Skinny Boys. They worked together quite a bit and it was an intriguing contrast in styles that was fresh. Good change of pace musical style for any old school or true hip hop fanatics. Where are they now? Have their own 'Wee' little mama girls! (laff)"
5,Store-N-Feed Jr.,This is a great feeding system for small (under 20 lbs) dogs! The ability to store his food underneath his dishes is so convenient. I am very happy with this product!
5,Absolute Victory is a Must Read!,"It was no accident that I picked Absolute Victory to read while on vacation. From the first sentence I was hooked as Robert Pino clearly outlined the principles of ""how to understand and create the life you want"". After reading the book in its entirety, I felt I had the power to make needed changes in my own life by applying the philosophies eloquently illustrated. Absolute Victory helped me to answer many questions I had about life and recognize that I am the creator of my own destiny. His words resonated deep in my spirit and transported me into a deeper level of thinking and understanding. The guidance and principles Robert outlines can help anyone to be more, do more, and live to their fullest potential. This book is a must read! I couldn't put it down."
5,Filled with imagery and strong characters,"When a house of witches is threatened by a greater power, the group must call in reinforcements from the past and form an even tighter band in order to survive. While familiarity with Hoffman's past titles on the theme will lend a quicker appreciation for the setting here, her fine story will engross even newcomers, filled with imagery and strong characters."
4,great epopea of italian medieval way of life,"Francesca da Rimini is the attempt by D'Annunzio to realize a type of woman different from others females characters during italian romanticism and the first years of the new century(you can see the differents from Francesca by S.Pellico). D'annunzio goes far and realized a poem full of sensuality, violence and poehtic lirism"
5,Rawk Out !,"Yes, these guys do rock. I saw them play here in Seattle and they put on a really fun, amped up show. They're rocked out and bluesy, and definitely perfect for cruisin in your ride or hanging at a summer party. Great debut album. See them live if you can. And they have a DJ too who had tight cuts and added a lot to the experience. I really appreciate bands giving turntablist/DJs respect. Tony C and the Truth Rawk on! Summer is officially here."
4,Great beginning and then fizzles.,The first half of the movie was amazing. The first few fight scenes put a big grin on my face and the story looked like it was going to be well fleshed out and then spppppppp! They rushed so fast through the end the story lost it's appeal. It's still a good film but could have been so much better if they just took their time to finish it properly. Still worth watching but more of a rental than a buy.
4,WOW very unexpected...,"It has been quite a while since I really enjoyed DTS playback, I usually prefer THX/EX/DD. This just blew me away though. My receiver flagged the DVD as 6.1 Matrix, even thought the setup choices are DD/DTS 5.1.Great martial arts, well placed special effects and the slight mixture of comic book like scenes mix well along with a decent story.Definitely demo material in my opinion! And very much recommended. If you have even a modest HT system that is calibrated correctly, this is a treat - thumbs up for me:)"
4,"An entertaining album from the first ""Pop Princess""",With You & So Easy are the highlights for me in this album but no track is bad. Overall a very good effort. My sister bought this on tape when I was 15 and I've liked it ever since. In fact I recently bought the CD. A good nostalgic album reminiscent of a time of love & innocence.
3,Only for the Devote Shakespearean Readers,"Incredible story with lots of plot lines and hidden meanings. For many, the nuances cannot be grasped when read, but easier to see when the play is acted out. Historical knowledge of the pre-republican Rome is also a requirement before you can fully understand the motivation of the Tribune characters."
5,Shakespeare's Greatest,"Shakespeare's last and greatest tragedy, *Coriolanus* dramatizes the conflict between pride and envy--those two antagonists which were the favorite characters of ancient myth.Coriolanus is a man of Virtue, when virtue meant 'manliness' not 'modest chastity.' Above all, he had the virtue of pursuing virtue, which he refused to compromise and which he refused to hide. In contrast, the aristocracy and the mob whom they serve despised Coriolanus precisely because he was good and refused to be otherwise.*Coriolanus* is Shakespeare at the height of his powers, and the real tragedy is that this work is not better known."
4,Interesting Blend of Work,This book gives an account of the projects undertaken by the firm Payette Associates. It includes one of my favorite projects Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi. Its a great book if you like to see a great combination of design in health care projects.
3,***,"Contrived in spots, but includes some great stuff, and his portrait of Wolf Larsen is a first-rate study of a true sociopath."
5,Great Book!,"This is probably one of the best examples of character devolopment that I have ever read. London paints a pictures of Humphrey, Wolf Larson, and the rest so that the act as real people. It is also topped off with a great story of adventure and romance. However, the most important point of the book is the good versus evil, or the one who believes in God versus the one who does not. The reader struggles with the same questions placed on Humphrey until the good finally triumphs in the end."
4,Incredibly modern account of life on the high seas!,"No account of life at sea lacks the brutality & harshness of it; Sea Wolf, although published in 1904, is an incredibly modern account! Too often, first-person narratives are self-absorbed & self-conscious: narrator Van Wyden is that sort of person, but the narrative is not! The twin characters of Wolf Larson & Van Wyden seem to be a composite of Jack London himself!"
2,Unexciting,"This was one of the few books I found on Amazon regarding the subject of resisting a system. I find it a tough read, because of the author (Gandhi himself) has a writing style I find unexciting. The book started with a very methodical explanation of what Satyagraha is, and inserts transcripts of hearings before British officials (yawn!). A book I wish I hadn't bought, but your style may be different and you may enjoy it."
2,Herman Melville's Clarel - a 19th C pilgrims' progress?,"This is a welcome affordable version of the Northwestern U./Newberry edition of Herman Melville's one epic poem. The poem is a useful window on the views of mid-19th century American Protestants who were neither orthodox nor liberal. Science (including Darwin)(and materialism (or ""Mammon"")) vs. Faith and the continuing presence in Palestine of Jews, Moslems, Catholics and Greek Orthodox, and tourists (sometimes viewed almost as another sect) are among the subjects of attention for Melville's Euro-American group of pilgrims.Negatives: 1) the story-line itself is less than gripping and is largely a device to enable the characters to conduct a series of debates.2) this edition, if my copy is any indication, is poorly bound: five segments of about 20 pages each fell out of the binding. (Despite this fallout, the spine of the book remained uncreased.) Only the first three segments of the book (about 150 of the 530 or so pages) remained intact."
3,Didn't grab me,"Merchant's Partner is a business like medieval mystery. It has all the right indgridients and has an interesting plot as well as a likeable lead character but somehow it never really rises above adequate.An old woman is found murdered and the local pretty boy is suspected of being the killer. Our hero, a former Templar knight (imagine a 12th century Catholic Jedi) must find the killer and prevent more murders. Along the way he's bedazzled by a sexy widow who may know more about the murder than she should.It's a solid begining but the story is marred by a horribly slow pace, and by historical blunders. The wolf scene was beautifully written but it rejects both history and animal behavior. The author also occasionally makes the mistake of making people from the past think and talk like folks do today.There are things to like about this book but there wasn't enough to make me want to stick with the series."
2,not up to the hype,"I am disappointed with this product after reading all the great reviews. I followed the directions to the letter, including taking fresh lemon juice to aid the reaction, etc. As the directions state, taking 2 more each night until reaching 3-5 bowel movements the next day. I am up to taking 16 pills, and have yet to have more than 2 BMs the following day, and have lost at most 1, maybe 2 lbs that I can directly attribute to this product, going from 245 to about 243. My stomach/intestines/bowels do make some noise, and true to form, my BMs are liquified. Word of warning...if you try this stuff and you feel the need to pass gas, do so at the very high risk of it not being just gas. Disgusting, I know, but I'm just being honest and trying to let you know what you are getting in to here.I would have given one star, but since it did seem to help a little, I gave 2 stars.As far as the shipping...I think I had the product 2-3 days after ordering, so no complaint there."
3,colon cleanser,"Haven't tried it yet, but will when I have some time to be at home, since expecting frequent visits to bathroom."
2,Not Effective!!,"Disappointed with the results of this product. Will never purchase it again. Yes, it liquifies feces, but very little results.I was not happy with the product & felt it was not effective."
2,"Works, but gives you loose stools","It works, but just gives you complete diarrhea which I could have gotten for a lot less money by buying a laxative. So to say the least I am dissapointed."
2,Major Bloating!,"I have taken six tablets for four days. It has caused bloating, several small bouts of watery stools and no relief. I will continue it for a couple more days to see if bloating decreases. I'm still looking for a helpful product without the cramping and bloating."
3,Is this FAKE?,"I bought it because it said its from global healing but I just received mine and it said its from some Chinese guy. I'm VERY SKEPTICAL when it comes to things that are from China. They are the country of replica. Last time I bought my oxy-powder, Im pretty sure it was in a larger bottle although it was 120 capsules. This new oxy-powder I received today, the expiration date has been smudged. I'm giving more stars than I should only because I'm not 100% sure if this is legit or not. I hope this is legit."
4,It works!!!,"This products works. I have tried others, and don't get me wrong the others have worked. But Oxypowder has achieved better results. I normally take two capsules before going to bed. The next morning your body is ready. I definitely think it is worth the hefty price."
4,Really Cleans You Out!!,"Granted, its no miracle pill it not like I lost 20 lbs in one session or anything. But it certainly does help you get rid of any unwanted colon build up and makes your tummy a lot less bloated looking. I have a VERY VERY sensitive digestive system so I was a lil afraid at first, but there is definately no uncomfortable stomach cramps, gas, or discomfort with these pills. Great product!"
2,Start somewhere else.,"If you are interested in a general survey of European history during this period, which is ironically what this book purports to be, I'd suggest starting somewhere else. This book is complementary to an already working knowledge of these years in Europe but as the initial exposure to it will frustrate anyone. Roberts describes some events in insightful detail but then makes passing reference to others I consider major ones without explanation, as if assuming the reader already knows about them. He does this with annoying regularity. If you are looking to fill in the cracks of your knowledge on this subject, this may be the book for you. Otherwise find a genuine survey on the subject and build some depth first."
1,A blindingly obvious revelation,"The author seems amazed that young males, brimming over with testosterone and adrenaline, would be interested in sex. If you were not previously aware of this, you find find the book enlightening."
5,Listen only to me,"I really liked this book. A very candid, honest, expose of one woman's experiences in Iraq and the Army. Most people wouldn't have the ""cojones"" to speak as freely as this young lady. She never hesistates to tell the truth even if it might possibly put her in a ""bad"" light in some peoples eyes. F'ing right, war is tough, but so is she. It's an insider view, a ""day in the life"" so to speak. Give the girl a chance, she's probably done something more daring than any of these couch potato reviewers ever has (myself included). Kayla rocks and holds nothing back.I found it very interesting, revealing, and sexy (she's a babe)Godspeed Kayla, Merry Christmas."
3,An Immature Approach,"This war memoir reveals a smug, self-absorbed author. Kayla Williams castigates the military and her fellow soldiers to make herself look superior, an immature approach that detracts from the book's success. Readers are reminded repeatedly of her college education, which leads one to question why she enlisted and chose not to be commissioned as an officer. The female officers and enlistees I know do not talk or act like Williams, and she's done a disservice to them and our men with this diatribe."
3,from a feminist,"I picked this Kindle title to get a female perspective of the modern war effort and because of its original low price in e-book form. Although it was not exactly what I hoped or expected, and the author did seem a bit self-absorbed, I didn't find it as bad as some of the reviewers here suggest.Sure, sexism exists everywhere. It sucks that it exists within the military realm, but I hope her experience with the jerks she ran into among the ranks are the exception and not the norm. My biggest issue was with how well she proclaimed to do her job, especially in comparison to a female superior officer. Who is she trying to convince here, the reader or herself? As the old saying goes, me thinks thou doth protest too much!"
1,utterly uninspiring,"This surprisingly dull and uninspiring biographical account of a young woman's military service during the Iraq invasion of 2003 reads like a mediocre required high school English paper, some required home work assignment. Dull and uninsightful."
1,Nothing but a POGUE! writing garbage.,This tripe was a coat hangar abortion don't waste your time or money! No value what so ever insult to those that are serving and those who have served!
1,Another whining soldier,"I checked this book out of my library because I was curious to hear another woman's take on the US Army. I served for 7 1/2 years between 1977 and 1985 as a radio repairer mostly in the former West Germany during the Cold War. I left the Army to stay home with my babies.I found the substance of Ms Williams book to consist mostly of whining drivel. In the Signal Corps we consider Military Intelligence to be an oxymoron and in Ms Williams case that appears to be true. Don't let her fool you. Her experiences do not hold true for the whole Army. During my service I met very few men that I had problems with. Any high school student will tell you that if you are different life will be difficult.In the Army, if you are not with the program, you are against it. The one thing I remember about the Army is teamwork. All need to work together to successfully accomplish the mission. I saw no evidence that Ms Williams even cared about the mission."
2,not impressed,"I am a female in the military. I decided to read this book based on Kayla Williams credentials. I assumed it would be an intellectual read. I was not impressed. Where did she learn to write? Everytime I thought her story was going somewhere interesting, she changed the subject. I do, however, admire her honesty. I think the emotional rollercoaster is sometimes hard to admit for anyone, not just a female."
3,Not what I expected,"It took me two days to read this book. I was a Marine in the 90's and my career didn't go far due to an injury. This books was written like a diary of a mad and angry woman. I am sure war can make you become angry and if you are already angry, it makes it worse. She is highly driven and somehow thinks that quality should get her awarded some sort of automatic respect. She needs to get past her sexual assault as a teenager in order to get on with a more positive future. Having been there before I know, it can make you angry and any little comment can be take then wrong way.She seems to be searching for a family and will never be able to accept it and enjoys chaos."
5,worth the price,"Yes, it's more expensive than grocery store brands. But this is the best rash cream out there. My daughter's very sensitve skin is calmed overnight with this product. A little goes a very long way. I now use their bath and skin products exclusively."
2,jazz pianist,"Hines is one of the great masters and innovators of jazz. But unless you are a real collector, this is not Hine's best stuff. Go for his earlier recordings."
3,"Not her best, but a few standout tracks save the project...","Just as Justo Roteta below stated, this album suffers from many of the problems that affected RB/Jazz music in the 80's, it is way over produced, and there is too much going on. However, Bofill stands strong despite the production, and her voice is a beautiful as ever. The title track is my favorite, and ""Who Knows You Better"" is fun. Hopefully the project is re-released, so that Bofill fans wont have to pay such a ridiculous price to get a copy."
5,Excellent!,"See review given to Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics and which were meant for Irving Fisher's Elementary Principles of Economics, with my apology as I clicked the unintended title.Having said that Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics has great things to say on Demand/Supply analysis. This was my first textbook even before I understood anything about economics and before university.P.S.: Could you rearrange the reviews for me please?"
4,Lucini Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Great olive oil for the money.,"I found this in my local supermarket (publix - Ilive in FL) for $11.99 if you can believe it. At that price, has to be the best deal on an estate grown olive oil out there. Clean olive taste, low acidity (very mild sensation in back of throat, no burning!)They make a similarly priced 10 yr old balsamic too. Gotta try it!Phil"
4,A ripping yarn. A fun read with intrigue and suspense.,"People who like John Buchan's work will enjoy this adventure. John McNab has the suspense of the Hannay series but with the lightheatedness of an adventure. Three friends meet in the highlands of Scotland and set themselves each a challenge to poach trophy wildlife from the laird. They advise the laird what they will poach and when, in letters signed ""John McNab"". The laird takes up the challenge to catch the ficticious John McNab before he can carry out the warned of task."
3,What Alice knew ...,"Whenever Alice, the novel's protagonist, turns her acerbic wit on the stuffy philistines surrounding her, the results are simply hilarious, and I honestly consider rereading some of these chapters to better savour their verbal acrobatics.Traversing this novel, however, was by no means an unalloyed pleasure: first, as Alice's fellow citizens tend to come across as cardboard caricatures, the sheer length of the harangues does not always seem justified; and what is more, these entertaining bits come in between expansive stretches of densely allusive prose, littered with literary references and snatches of verse.These parts definitely exhausted my patience and went beyond my intellectual grasp, but I still wonder if to some extent this is not simply a novel that wants to be too clever by half and in doing so diminishes the impact of the monstrosities lurking at its dark core."
3,Disappointed,Not the mariachi sound I was expecting from this group. It is a very danceable album but I think Campanas de America should stick to the music they are more noted for.
3,Alright,I acually read this book while waiting in line to get my JCI it has a few minor flaws but some spells work a little....want good earthly spells become a druid not Wicca (nothing against them)
3,An OK intermediate guide to witchcraft,"I'm 14 and I wanted to do a few things for luck, money, women, and revenge. I thought this book would help alot, I was sort of right. It should be a SLIGHTLY INTERMEDIATE book instead of a BEGINERS. Most spells require you to make a GUFFAH BAG....but it doesn't say exactly how. It also requires a few hard to find ""ingredients"" like fox, or muskrat intestine. Overall I'd say get this as your SECOND witchcraft book."
2,Meh,"This is supposedly a self-help classic, but I wouldn't want to turn to it in a time of need. The writing is schlocky and the book is full of vague generalizations without concrete examples. I was looking for a passage to use as a reading in my wedding ceremony, having seen excerpts of this book online. I definitely didn't want such terrible writing to be a part of my big day."
4,nice short read for the pool,"Musings on life, marriage, children and more ~ this book is a nice short book to read at the beach or by the pool. It makes for inspirational ponderings and shell collecting. Makes a nice gift as well."
5,A Must Read,"I read this book over 25 years ago, and it was four times as rich and deep after 25 years of lived experience. I will reread every year now. Both inspirational and insightful."
3,Mostly for women,"The number of references to women in this book makes it a book for women. Anyone can have a fragmented life in today's conditions compared to decades ago. But, Lindberg discusses the topic in relation women. She offers some solutions for becoming more collected, calm, and centered - especially creative activities for onself. It seems to be good advice for anyone but this is only a small part of the book. Her analogies to sea shells didn't add anything for me. Her comments on feminism in the last chapter, which was added in 1975, give the impression that this is a book for feminists.If you want reading about calming your life, a good way to start is to read books by Albert Ellis. Two good ones are A Guide to Rational Living and How to Make Yourself Happy and Remarkably Less Disturbable. Another good book is A Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine."
5,Gift from the Sea,"I was given this book from a dear friend. When I finished reading it, I ordered 10 copies to give as Christmas gifts. This is a timeless book for women of all ages and stages of life. It speaks to your heart, no matter what you are going through, in good times and in troubled times. I can't believe it was written 50 years ago!You will read it again and again."
5,Truth is Stranger than Fiction,"It is fashionable to bemoan the state of the world. The conventional wisdom is that global warming, Terrorism, drug abuse, crime, AIDS and all the rest of the crises threatening humanity lead us to the conclusion that the ""good old days"" were somehow better, safer and saner than today.But, if things are so bad why is infant mortality going down around the world? If things are on the edge of anarchy why are proportionately fewer of us hungry, or sick today than one hundred years ago. If things are going to hell in a handbasket why is our life expectancy steadily improving?These are inconvenient questions. The answers are tough on the prophets of doom.Luckily, the conventional wisdom is wrong. Stephen Moore and Julian Simon prove this convincingly. Facts are often inconvenient. But, if you want to know the facts, this is the book for you."
5,Wow! (But you'll have to read it a few times...),"As a frustrated high-school student whose teacher could explain certain phenomena only as ""QED,"" this book has been integral in satisfying my curiosity for ""why stuff does stuff.""Feynman's work is incredible-it explains so much with so little (on the surface...), and in a way clear enough so that even someone who hasn't been through more than two high-school level physics courses can understand. (Only after several reads, however!)If you are someone interested in why things work, look, and act the way they do, read QED! (Then read it again!)"
5,Excellent,"I am an Electrical Engineer and had the usual education. It is a delight to read this book and learn about the fundamental theory upon which much of the Electrical Engineering profession is based.Much of what we are taught in schools is an approximation and sometimes wrong. It is great to learn, even if it is only qualitatively, about more accurate representations.I wish that Feynman were alive to keep updating his lectures with the latest developments. The lectures seem to have been last updated in 1980s and I am sure Physics has moved on since then."
2,Doesn't seal as well as I thought,"It only seals if the bowl is al least 1/2 inch smaller, but then the edge hangs over making it hard to put in and take out of the fridge. I really wanted something I could put over a bowl and take to work for lunch (in a bag) so it's useless for that. It is OK for storing stuff in the fridge. I haven't needed to try it as a cooking lid so don't know how it works for that."
1,So disappointing,"This book would have been a complete waste of time if I'd finished it, but I stopped the muddy wade abruptly at about 75% of the way. No human feeling, no insight, poor communication style. It's your worst college class between the covers of a book."
1,Assassins!,"Dear God,If you're really up there, how can you let people do something so horrible to such a great book? This movie is an absolute monstrosity, and everyone involved with it should hang themselves. Fante is a genius. Do NOT attempt to alter his works."
1,Prejudiced,"It's a sorry film. Horrible quality. Cheap laughs at the expense of gay people. Demonstrates the unfortunate, but widespread prejudice against gays in the black community. Characters act as if gays have a disease. Just sad. God is love. This movie sure ain't showing any love."
1,BEWARE!! Your gecko might lose his tail with this hide,"Our gecko loves this hide as do the kids. A little too much it seems. You must prop the hide up on a great number of layers of carpet or the like to be sure the inside and the outside do not ""rock"" when taking the outside portion off. This afternoon, we discovered our little gecko had lost it's tail thanks to this hide. It ""rocked"" open and when shutting, his tail was crushed and came off."
4,Medium size a little tight for a single adult Leopard gecko.,"It's a great product. Be sure to properly level so the den is completely flush against glass to ensure no tails or toes can get between it and the glass.I bought the medium thinking it would be great for my single Leo. It is a little smaller than I had hoped for.After researching it it seems like the size difference between medium and large are significant. The top level in the medium is pointless for a Leo. I'm returning this to upgrade to the large as I have large tank anyways.I recommend that all new reviews post the size den they buy and the application, as all the reviews for all sizes are in one place. It can be confusing as a buyer to know what size to buy, even with reviews."
2,The music steals the show,Great original score to an otherwise fair episode. The last scene with Kirk at Miramanee's bedside is very effective & touching. This guy Kirk can't win --talk about unlucky in love!
4,Better than expected,"Wow. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one, but I was surprised. It had action, suspence, humor,and a few twists. The only parts I didn't like were the scenes on the bridge. Other thann that, I recommend it."
3,Why use 'THE DEPARTED' picture for INFERNAL II box promotion???,"INFERNAL AFFAIRS is the quintessential police/crime thriller. It is so elegant in story structure, acting and production that Scorsese has virtually remade the film by copying the original nearly scene by scene. So THE DEPARTED is not a bad movie--how could it be with such a template to follow? Will Scorsese follow up with a prequel as well? Don't know, don't care. Think this prequel deserves an authentic picture on Amazon. Do we have to see THE DEPARTED movie poster for the INFERNAL II box as well? What gives here?"
5,In a word - FANTASTIC!,"This is the best rock/pop CD I have ever heard! Buy it and be amazed. If you like Nickleback, Toploader, The Calling, Hootie, Vertical Horizon & even the mighty MATCHBOX 20, Jones blow them away!I cant recommend this CD highly enough.........BUY IT!"
4,Perfect!,The scent is just what I can handle. I can't use heavy or smelly perfumes and this one is soft and delicate. I got few compliments.
2,unusual scent,"This one was not good on my skin. I wanted to experience a ""cyphre"" It is unusual, in that it is not what ""everyone is wearing"". I gave it away."
2,Where'd the Replacements Go?,"I'm a minor fan of the Replacements, but this solo effort by Westerberg is simply sub-par and BORING. (Although I do enjoy Silver Naked Ladies) The only good work he's done since going solo is on the Singles movie soundtrack. Buy that instead."
3,Should have been 8 Songs.,"Consistency has been the main problem with Westerberg's solo albums. He's still one of the best songwriters around, but for every ""Blackeyed Susan"" there's a clunker like ""World Class Fad"". Overall, it's still worth adding to your collection."
5,It is a book I love and always will,"I found this book at a library when I was 8yrs old and loved it. It was very clear by the way he wrote, that Mr. Terhune loved and understood dogs. I am 13 now and do not consider it childish. I wish Mr. Terhune was alive to write nore."
4,nightmare worlds,"I am leaning towards the older movies from yesterday, some i remember only vaguely so to see them once again. Well, some are as good as i remember them yet others are not so good. The picture quality on some are not as good better on others the audio quality in some parts of these films are a little hard too hear but that does not detract that i really like these films. Considering that some of these gems were made way back in 1930- onwards if you are mad like me and like something different then this could be a pack for you i hope this review helps people wayne shepherd"
3,Better be a fan,"Don't get me wrong I think it is great they are available on DVD, but there is some better stuff available and I would rather have two or three great instead of 50 okay. If you just want to see this then it may be worth the price and you can always donate it to the library or a vets organization. Personally I won't keep this set because my shelves are already full of DVDs I don't go back and watch regularly. What do you think will happen with 50 so-so movies? So unless you are a big fan of some of these movies, don't bother."
1,buy at your own risk,"So far I have viewed 3 sides of disks. The sleeves & disks are mislabeled. What should have been a gem feature, Anthony Perkin's How Awful About Alan, deteriorates within a few minutes, & disappears to be replaced by the next feature somewhere past its beginning.This collection is listed as unrated. Of course, many of the early features pre-date the movie rating system. However, there are a significant number of rated movies - some PG, but leaning heavily toward R.On a cheerful note, you can just reconcile yourself to thinking, ""So - even if only a few movies are watchable, it's worth the price."" But it's not worth messing with returns & hoping you'll really receive 50 watchable movies."
4,Great for anyone who has to focus on performance issues,This does not have anything that the Informix manuals do not have if you look long and hard enough. It does however cover a lot of ground in a very easy to read form. As a DBA familiar with online v7. this was money I do not regret spending at all !
4,works as promised,"product works as promised ... can't really eat one every day since you get tired of the taste and the stickiness of the bar when you chew it... however, having one every couple of days is tollerable and works great... you feel much better... I think this bar is great to have as a set of fiber tools you are using to stay healthy... not as the ONLY way to stay healthy..."
1,"Brought 2 of them, since there is really nothing out there","That can compare in this cam in terms of spec. I didn't have a chance to open the second box yet, but whatever the reason, the build in web browser freezes every 15m or so when it is in WiFi mode. I'm on phone with their technical support right now. No one there is really familiar with the product!!!! And they sound like teenagers!!! I can't believe it! I will try the second unit tonite. Looks like I'm going to be returned... 5 people on Level I never heard of this product. This is crazy. Going in for level II now... 45m and counting.... If anyone out there that know of a good forum or know I'm talking about, please email me at ometofu@yahoo.com. Thanks"
5,great book! very interesting and well put together,"I just got a copy of this book and it's phenominal! greay layout, easy to read, quick reference. definitely a must-have for every school, guidance counselor, head-hunter and EVERY high-school student. Such an eclectic array of jobs... covering the whole spectrum from Magician to Musician, Doctor to Dancer, Shoe Designer to Stock Broker.I think I'll be a rock star and moonlight as a sailor or lobbyist..."
3,Quite big and molding was not clean,"I bought this for my wife, and we are experienced using sexual aids. This was a little too thick, but the biggest complaint is that the molding was not clean. There were a lot of black streaks through the rubber which took away from the appeal."
4,Masters of Classical Music,"This is an extraordinary collection by the most influential composers and they're very well-performed. My only disappointment is with the recording quality of quite a few of the selections. They sound as if they were converted to CDs from badly scratched records with lots of annoying popping. However, for variety, this set is a great value."
1,Headline: This Film Is Pure Dreck!,"News Flash,..... Don't waste your money on this one, I rented it from a Red Box for a Dollar, and it wasn't worth the Buck, or even the one star I had to give it to be able to write this review. In fact the only thing about this movie worth one star, was the nice graphics on the cover of the DVD. So save your money People, ""Ciao""."
3,A winner??,"I have heard so much about this novel, and started it with great expectations. The fact that it was a award winner in such an aclaimed competition ensured that I would like it. I was disapointed. The most acurate way to describe this novel, is that of having both good points and bad. Something that confused me immensly whislt endevouring to read this book was whether it fell upon biography or fiction. The photographs and tree lead me believe that it was infact a real family, yet I was told later it was not. I was constantly wanting a climax to the novel, something that would grasp and return my interest in what had so far been a tedious and dull book. It never came. It was the story of, a life. A typical life. We know of it, we can relate to it, so why must we read it? I felt, that while this may attract some readers, it bored the hell out of me. Well written, true to life, sure, but dead dull."
3,I expected more...,"This book does reflect the inability to define one's life in an autobiography. We drift around the years, doing one insignificant thing, and then another. It all adds up to a life that is meaningful to ourselves and our families...but to everyone else it is mundane. The mundane can be interesting, because we all have these experiences. We can relate to them.This book bothers me because the mundane is recorded, we experience Daisy's life, but there is no heart. Despite the drudgery of our lives, they mean something to us. These events should have more heart and color. They feel as if they are being told from the point of view of a fly on a wall. The reader doesn't experience the emotions of the characters. The entire novel feels as if it is being told by a participant that has no emotional attachment to anything that has happened. The effect is rather boring."
1,Worse than watching paint dry.,"This book came highly recommended to me, so I was a little concerned when I didn't feel it warranted the same merit. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this book was the most boring they had ever read. I've read slower, quieter books before and quite enjoyed them. However, this book was beyond slow. I didn't make it past the first three chapters, and I must say that if a book doesn't grab me in the slightest way within the first 120 pages, then it is not worth my time."
2,"Great Writing, Little Substance","This book is one of the most boring books I've ever read. There are enough ramblings for Mars and back. Carol Shields is a very good writer, but the underlying pretensions makes the book just another romantic potboiler. If you're interested in books about generations of families, read Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude."
2,Stone Diaries,"Tough book to get into and stick with....lots of detail to wade through. Characters were bland and boring, and a bit sad. The whole story was depressing."
4,The Tale of An Amazing Woman!,"There is a lot to say abou this book. For the most part, I thought it possessed a wonderful description of the life of Daisy Goodwill Flett. Although there were times when it did not hold my full attention, and I felt it could have easily been made clearer and more interesting, the book was excellent. Towards the end, though, I began to get bored and uninterested. Oh well, read it and see what you think! It definitely deserves your time, especially if you are a compassionate person. It definitely made me want to examine my life and realize what is truly important to me."
4,I read this book for an English OAC Independant Study,"I've never been a fan of narratives and therefore this novel was a dramatic change of genre. I must say that I kept waiting for some dramatic event to happen and I was kind of dissapointed when it didn't. I must say though, that the beauty of the book isn't quite what's written but what the story and Daisy make you reflect upon when you have completed it. It's not often that a book does that."
3,not pulitzer material,"I read Stone Diaries as a school project. While there are many interesting characters along the way I was waiting for something big to happen. Usually this is assumption made with pulitzer books. It is not that this book is horrible..it just seems unrealistic at times and leaves you with a very dull, empty ending. I suggest the much less ""prize-acclaimed"" yet far more deserving, Larry's Party by Shields. IN my opinion it deserved to win the Giller."
3,A richly imaginative novel,"I couldn't get into this book for several chapters ~~ it just wouldn't hold my interest since it was so mauldin in the beginning. Once I got through Daisy's childhood, the reading became more diverse and more imaginative, very rich in detail of the inner life of a woman growing up in the early and mid Twentieth Century.It is a beautifully written novel ~~ and Daisy is a character richly drawn ~~ but the book just didn't capture my interest like other novels did. However, I don't regret picking this novel up to read. I've heard so much about it and was glad to know that there are still good books out there. It's a book to share with family and friends ~~ and perhaps good for a discussion around the suppertable.12-29-03"
4,"Very, very wonderful!","This is a recording by a very great orchestra, conducted by a top-notch conductor, and featuring a very good recording. Why is it so reasonably priced? It is a live recording(complete with applause at the end) and has a couple of moments where the orchestra stumbles a little, one or two overly loud timpani strikes, and lots of plainly adible coughing from the audience. It really wouldn't have been fair to charge big dollars for it, I suppose, but I almost would have paid it. I have lots of 9ths and especially from the third movement on, this is right up there with the best of them. Very musical, wonderful singing, heartfelt and rich without being grandiose, the last movement gets 5 stars."
1,Do not get IF YOU ALLREADY GOT the Director 6 and Lingo Auth,I give only one star because I allready got the Director 6 and Lingo Authorized (good one). The book is very good but someone must prevent buyers from buying this book if they got Director 6 and Lingo Authorized. The book is practicaly the same. If you do not have D6 book this is a good one. I personally want my money back but ....
5,Amazing read...,An amazing read and a masterful translation. I was captivated by the book and relished every page. Well worth your while...
4,Great light reading,"I remember Harlan Ellison writing about his dead friends inAngry Candyand being particularly angry with an obituary writer that didn't know Theodore Sturgeon. After reading this book, I can see why. Sturgeon was one of those strange brilliant writers that managed to push the genre past the pure science/theoretical/rocket ship ghetto. His characters are slightly borsht belt (even lower east side) but his grasp of the human experience is excellent.While many of these stories are the genre tropes - the weak man trying to kill his overbearing aunt, the space con artists against the slightly befuddled aliens, the haunted house - they manage to feel fresh under the expert hand of Sturgeon.Granted, once the book is over you forget it, but it's wonderful light reading and deserves classic status much more than the current batch of ""classics"" from that era (no I didn't like Saul Bellow. I foundSeize the Day (Penguin Classics)a plodding mess. And don't even get me started on Arthur Miller)"
5,A Gem of a Book,"This book is Steinbeck at his finest. The short stories are tied together, but each stands gloriously on its own. I have found that I prefer his ""lesser"" works, and this one is my favorite. His use of language and his character development are perfection. Each story is a detailed and solid vignette of life behind the walls we erect. Read this book!"
5,Windhund Division,"The real story of the 116.Panderdivision Windhund from the qualified point of view of Major Heinz Günther Guderian (later General in the new reformed Bundesheer), son of that General Guderian father of the Blitzkrieg.Every aspect is discussed, as technical as human.Every battle is explained in detail, with a large use of military terms, maps and original documents.Also the difficult realtions between the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht and the subordinated units are analized, giving the exact sense of those difficult days at the end of World War Two.This is the point of reference about the 116.Panzerdivision, only a larger number of pictures should be needed to carry out an outstanding work."
3,Roark's has been not been improved,The book is now twice the thickness of the 6th Edition book. This makes opening and keeping open the book much more difficult. Also the paper type chosen makes it difficult to turn the pages.I highly recommend keeping the sixth edition until they figure what is truly important to Structural/Mechanical Engineer.
5,Comfy!,Shoes were as specified; I liked them so much I kept them and got my relative a different present......
4,Husband Loves Them,"Good quality and great fit, even for a wider foot. I would recommend and buy another pair for my husband."
4,Comfortable slippers,This purchase was for a replacement of a almost identical pair of moccasins I purchased from Amazon over ten years ago. The first pair was so long lasting and durable I wanted to get as close as possible for the replacement pair. I think I have found the perfect replacement. The sole and color are identical. They seem to be very comfortable and decent quality. Amazon has a way of making the selection easy. Thank you.
4,Indoor/outdoor slippers,They were shipped promptly. I wear a 10 D in most shoes & that's what I ordered. A little big. If you can go a 1/2 size smaller I would. The lining on the inside's a little thin but about right for the price. Be careful how you choose your shipping method. Usually the cheapest method is either preselected or at the top of the shipping options. This one had the most expensive preselected & on top.
4,Really comfortable slippers,"The slippers are well made, comfortable, and fit well in bare feet. The only complaint that I have is that they could be a bit wider to accommodate wearing socks."
3,He's licensed to kill - and more...,"Step back into the Cold War with Isreal Bond, spy for the pre-Gaza Isrealis. Bond, a.k.a. Hebrew Secret Agent Oy-Oy-7, is not only licensed to kill, but also to perform a memorial service over the victim, already. Bond is dark, sinewy, and cruelly handsome.. he is a dashing, unstoppable spymaster mixed up in the most insanely sinister plot ever unleashed against the tiny nation of Erets Israel, fabled Land of Milk and Magnesia.Before the events of 1967 and beyond, Israel was much easier seen as the ""underdog"" to people in the United States. Sol Weinstein capitalized on all that and more. His writing style is a great parody of Ian Fleming's, and the ethnic ""in-jokes"" are pure borscht belt.So enjoy, already!"
4,"more to see than TROPIC OF CANCER,Henry's best!","i've read several books of henry's,but it's the very best coz i'm moved by what he said,so frank so grey so sentimentaland so good. sometimes i jsut forget he wrote it so long time ago,his work is everygreen,so to speak."
1,haven't received it yet!,"How can I rate this product, I haven't received it yet. It's been 3 weeks!!! And why are a certain amount of words required to write a review!!!"
1,Very Unhappy Buyer,I bought this product for my son's computer. It lasted a total of 44 days and died. I contacted Amazon and they said I was out of luck because it was over 30 days old (nice support). They said to contact Westronics but they don't have a link or any way to contact them. So at this point I have a piece of junk 44 day's old and no way to send it back. Maybe Amazon's not the way to shop. Not to mention the people they work with are not to reputable.
2,Heavy,"Really heavy. The wires are such that the adaptor remains near the computer. Actually the adaptor should remain close the electrical outlet. To enable that, the wires should be swapped - meaning, the wire from the outlet to the adaptor should be shorter and the wire from the adaptor to the computer should be longer."
4,A must-read for the military historian,"The title comes from the German view of the English soldiers who charged into their machine guns and barbed wire: ""Lions led by donkeys."" The donkeys were the professional officers of the British army that was destroyed in those battles, officers who were unable to adapt to the awful technology that changed the face of war forever. When I was studying under Michael (now Sir Michael) Howard at All Souls in 1972-4, he insisted that this book should be read by anyone who wanted to understand the early phase of the Great War. It is a classic and must be read by anyone trying to understand the impact of the War on the English people, and the shock of the early battles on the perception of the British military of what needed to be done. It is judgmental to be sure, and would not be the only source one would need to understand this critical transition, but it is nonetheless an essential text.Bob Rizzi Bethesda, MD"
5,wonderfull book,"I love this book. The recipes are wonderful. I'm a big fan of ina garten. I offer this book to one of my friend and she was delighted, it's a beautiful book.I also bought Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher it's also a beautiful, wonderful book."
5,Butternut squash and apple soup recipe is awesome!,"I feel like I shouldn't be giving this a star rating since I don't actually own the book, but I've read most of it. My mom has the book and I copied out the butternut squash and apple soup recipe. It is delicious! I don't have dinner parties but I make it for myself as an everyday meal. I'm just out of college and always trying to find things that taste good, are easy/quick, inexpensive, and healthy, though usually I have to sacrifice one or more for the others. This recipe tastes amazing, one of my favorite foods, and is also really easy. Since it's made from apples, onions, and squash, it's healthy, relatively inexpensive, and the ingredients stay good longer than most fresh fruits and vegetables (I always have trouble with fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. going bad before I make my dish).My mom also makes the beef tenderloin (filet mignon?)- though not with the sauce; it's our favorite thing for Christmas."
5,I just love Ina. What can I say,Great book. Simple and easy to follow instructions that lead to a great gourmet meal. You can't miss with anything Ina.
5,A Must Have for Anyone Ever Stationed at Barksdale,"As an AF brat and a civil servant who has been stationed at numerous Air Force bases, I found this book totally fascinating to read! Yes, it's easy to read, but that's what makes it so enjoyable. It's not your typical ""history"" book that will bore the average reader. It's informative and entertaining at the same time. I wish I had a book like this from every base I've lived on and/or worked at."
5,Excellent Daily Meditation Guide,My printed copy of this great little book was being held together with rubber bands. I was so glad to find it on kindle and at a very reasonable price. The format is very user-friendly.
4,Strong and Touching,"This novel is a great novel for not just women, but men as well. In the book, the main character is Gertie, who has problems with decision making. She is looking out for the best interests in her family. With her unselfish ways, she tries to do her best. This takes place during World War II, in the United States. During that time, people had to help in the war. Her husband was chosen to help out in Detroit, which is the beginning point of her problems. Since she is from the south, she experiences a whole new world up north, and at the same time deals with her problems in the family. Gertie, is probably one of the strongest woman characters that I have read. By reading this novel, you'll be able to experience the adventure and drama that Gertie goes through, it will touch your heart."
1,Awful!,"I am an avid reader but I found this book ""over the top"", too many characters, too slow, (stayed in one scene far too long), almost written in a 'foreign', very difficult 'language'. Unfortunately, not a good read at all."
5,The Dollmaker,"A great read that mixes just enough fiction with historical fact especially to those of us who lived during WWII. It traces one family from their coal mining Appalachian roots through its migration to earning a living in the industrialized city of Detroit. It raised a serious question: which life was actually better and in what ways? Existence became no more than a matter of survival skills in Detroit and the standard of living was extremely poor. It showed the influence of both management and the growth of unions in this turbulent period of War. Again, for those who lived it, perhaps in different parts of the country, it brings back a variety of memories...some that can be viewed as valuable and positive, even when at the time the events all seemed to be extremely negative!SMS"
4,Dollmaker,"Loved the movie, most times the books are even better so I bought the book, fast shipping, good transaction, book perfect condition, just was dissapointed in the story. Movie much better."
5,Inanna: Goddess of Heaven and Hell,This book was a fantastic read. I recommend any girl power supporter to read and discover the power of ancient goddesses.R.L.Rex
2,the padding of the year,"Dr Wecht gives his opinion on a famous autopsy and could report his thought in let-us-say 20 pages. in his desperate attempt to write a complete book and who-knows? get on the bestseller coattails of the murder, he managed to fill 350 pages. A Guinness record in padding!"
3,"If you've read the newspaper stories, you won't need this!","When I read some of the other reviews, I thought this book would tell us, supported with previously unreleased information, who actually killed JonBenet. But after reading this book, although entertaining, I have learned nothing that I didn't already know from reading the newspapers (not the tabloids). My opinion of this book was that it was too long, provided too much information about the Ramseys' extended families, business, acquaintences, etc. The book is titles ""Who Killed JonBenet?"". That's what I wanted to know along with the facts leading up to the determination and conclusion.Also, let's leave the parents alone for now. After all, everyone is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. Let's not forget what happened to Richard Jewell in Atlanta, GA after the '96 Olympics."
2,Cyril Wecht Name THE ONLY REASON THIS BOOK IS SELLING!!,The only reason this book is selling is because of the Cyril Wecht name. There was no new information in the book. All the stated information was already published in other publications. Disapppointed to read something already read....Save your $5.00!!
1,Haven't received it yet!,I would love to review this as requested but I have not received the magazine. It was ordered 11/30/09. Today is 2/1/10. Should I not have received the first magazine by now?
4,Loved it!,"As one that has to look around to get an idea of what the latest trends may be, this was a great help. I could (almost) duplicate outfits and at great savings. Target, Kohl's, etc. Just renewed my subscription."
2,I didn't get all of my issues...,"but it was a black Friday deal so I only paid $5. The magazine is over-rated, just thumb threw one in a bookstore or grocery store, it'll take a few minutes and that's all you'll need. It's mostly ads for fragrances and the style ideas are regurgitated in every other magazine. I didn't find any good ideas or neat online boutiques to shop from that were worth renewing."
1,upset,"I am very upset I subscribed to this magazine and never received an issue , an acknowledgement, nothing, and I was looking forward to this magazine being that I used to always buy it on the newstand, I feel like i have been ripped off ."
4,Interesting for all ages!,"Although this People StyleWatch subscription was a Christmas gift for my daughter, I enjoy reading the trendy, informative fashion tips as well."
1,People Style Watch Magazine order,I ordered this Magazine (People Style Watch) December 1st it was supposed to arrive in 6-10 weeks it has been over 10 weeks and I have yet to see on issue. I have e-mailed and called customer service and gotten no response from the e-mail and no satifaction or refund over the phone. I am very disapointed. I will be very leary of ever ordering discounted priced magazines from here again.
2,Worked great--then leaked,"I reviewed this product with an ecstatic 5 stars several months ago. It worked great in several swimming pools, on a trip to Hawaii, and through half of our time in Belize. Unfortunately, halfway through a snorkeling trip, I noticed what looked like water in the bag. Before I could get back to the boat, my $300 canon was dead. Before you ask, yes I properly sealed it. My advice is to get the real case, or buy a cheap waterproof model. The only reason not to have one is that they don't do video."
2,prompt service,"Good service thank you, but I thought the product was pooly made, as it snapped when the couch pushed over it. HOWEVER..I am not completely certain the electrician actually put it in right. But I still thought it should have held up longer then 2 weeks!"
1,Disappointing!,"While the scriptures are wonderful and uplifting, I was disappointed with Ms. Asti's focus on spending money, buying expensive wigs, clothing and furniture."
3,Good CD,"This CD is good, although I'm not much of a ""live"" music person when it comes to CDs. Amazed is definitely my favorite song. I will continue to listen!!"
5,Relaxing music at its finest!,"This is a GREAT 10-CD set!The performances are top-notch, the music is varied, and the feelings engendered are wondrously beautiful."
3,You get what you pay for,These gauges work but not without a little modification. It looks like they made a change in the oil pressure gauge but they did not make the corresponding change to the oil line that they pack in the kit. The adapter that goes into the engine fit fine and the oil line threaded right onto it but I had to drill out the taper inside of the oil pressure gauge to get the line to fit. The other gauges seem to work but they are a little hard to read at night. For the price it was not a big deal but if you get the same parts as I did expect to do a little modification to get the supplied parts to work together.
1,Garbage. Really.,"I got this at a very low price because creative is trying to clear the channel. It still wasn't worth it.The design is okay, but the build quality is awful. The plastic piece that holds the weight in broke off and so I had to glue one of the weights in permanently. My left mouse button also has the intermittent click pressure problem which makes the mouse useless.If you pay for this thing you are insane."
2,Good mouse...for about a month,"I bought this mouse right after getting a new laptop and Call of Duty 4. At first I was really impressed with the weights and the button to change the sensitivity. Unfortunately the honeymoon period didn't last long.After a few weeks inserting and removing the USB mouse cord would cause my computer to give me a blue screen and shut down (this hasn't happened with any other mice/mouses? on this computer). I learned to tolerate this...somehow, but after about 5 months the left mouse button decided it had a mind of its own. It was the same problem everyone else has had. Mouse double clicking or not clicking at all.Its a great mouse for gaming and other computing uses. Only drawback is that it will die out on you quickly. And if you're lucky like me it will cause your computer to crash on a daily basis."
1,broken left click,"what can you say about a $40+ mouse when its primary function fails.left clicks started registering as double clicks (annoying in windows)now they fail to register 80% of the time, so guns will shoot then stop then shoot. (really annoying)"
1,MOUSE BREAKS AFTER 1-3 MONTHS OF USAGE,"i bought 2 of these within 6 months. the one for christmas, broke after 3 months, they would NOT replace becuase i didn't not have receipt. I BOUGHT A SECOND ON EARLY APRIL, and it stopped working last week (1 month). I have the receipt this time, and they might give me a new one, but it will stop working in a few months guaranteed. FRAUD< there needs to be a recall."
1,"Do Not Buy this mouse, I regret having spent money on it.","I have been using this mouse for over 2 months. The mouse worked perfectly well for the first month, after that I started having the double click problem that other people mentioned in their reviews already. It's not a small thing that you can ignore, its very annoying and time consuming. The dpi sensitivity LED is a nice feature, but that's the only good thing about this mouse. I am switching back to the old MS mouse. So far my experiences with MS and Logitech mouse have been great. I am surprised no one has sued creative labs for selling this defective product in mass quantity, I believe if the other customers who gave a glowing review to the mouse were asked to update their old reviews at least half of them will be changing their mind about this. If you have already bought this mouse I suggest to return it or give it to your ex as a parting gift."
5,A great movie that stands the test of time!,"Papillon is an epic adventure of survival and determination. And two ikons like McQueen and Hoffman, you can't go wrong!"
5,Great story!,The parting line in the movie is my favorite of all! What a great story of someone who never lost hope.
2,Not THAT good,"I've had this set for years purchased from a retailer. I use these to store flour and sugar. Two major problems: 1. It's difficult to twist and open. The lid it too wide to get my fingers over it and there's no handle to grab and twist. I find it very awkward and difficult and approach it with dread. If it's not closed tight, bugs will get in. When it's closed just a little tighter than it needs to be (which you can't tell,) it's that much more difficult to open. 2. The opening is too narrow to be able to scoop flour out into a measuring cup without flour falling outside the container. I'm now in the market for a new cannister set.On the plus side, these cannisters will last forever. The ability to see what's inside the containers is always useful. I'll switch to storing something else. Just not sugar and certainly not flour."
1,Don't waste your money--this does not work.,This product was an absolute waste of money. It did not work.Not even after I also purchased the ortho singles application Weed B Gone 4-pack bottlesand followed the directions on the package.I sldo did a google search looking for videos demonstrating someone successfully using this product and nothing could be found. Wish I could get a refund.Save your money and try something else.
2,Good in the past. Newer version are poorly calibrated.,"This product was good in the past, delivering near correct amounts of chemical. More recent versions are poorly calibrated. Beware of inaccurate overly applied chemical delivery which may produce unexpected result -- especially lawn herbicides."
3,"Not Alan Rickman's Best Work, But Still Funny","I had pretty high expectations coming into this film, especially when I also so Eliza Dushku in it. Plus, the previews really hiped the movie up and made it look absolutely fantastic and funny.It was funny and it was cool, but I wish I had just rented it. Alan Rickman plays a cruel role very well, as he does in this movie, and I enjoyed the acting of the man who plays his son here, but other than that it was a very lackluster movie. It left me in ""want.""I recommend it for its actors, not so much the development of the movie."
3,Super Reader,"Red decides she needs a break way from it all for a while. However, the immense length of time she spends in suspended animation wasn't really what she had in mind.Upon awakening it seems she has been canonised for her role with the Strontium Dogs and mutants, and a lot of carnage has been carried out in her name.She also has to deal with the pretty horrific problem of a planet-sized brain sucker, or Mindfeeder if you want to be more polite, as well as a high up rat in the ranks."
3,Problems with the IRS,"Kaplan does an in-depth job of outlining problems within the IRS structure. Like most tax writers, the information tends toward avoiding an audit. The chapter on misconceptions of tax information is exceptional and with 45 million self-employed tax payers this is a group who are subjected to frequent audits. This number is rising as companies are down sizing and young people skilled in computer technology enter to workforce as small business owners.This is an older volume, published in 2003 and some of the material is dated. If there is one area impossible to keep current without annual installments it is federal taxes.Good information to have if you are studying taxes, but as help for the individual seeking information in their particular area it is lacking.Nash Black, author of ""Taxes, Stumbling Blocks and Pitfalls for Authors 2007."""
2,Nice but not enough information,This book gives the impression that you can get through this quickly and easily. Not so. Too little information on such an important subject.
2,Black Edelweiss-Disappointing,I was disappointed with this book when compared to a book such as Soldat. The author spends the first 75 pages discussing his youth and family which have little or no bearing on his experinces as a soldier. I found the description of training very superficial and the description of combat and Waffen-SS tactics and personal experiences very light when a more in-depth description of his feelings and experiences in combat would have been more interesting. This is a lightweight book on the Waffen-SS.
2,too many regrets and excuses,"Excellent work when covering combat actions up on the Artic Circle,but way to many pages dedicated to nonsense about authors family and their silent protest of Hitlers racial extermination of the Jews. What exactly did author beleive was going on in concentration camps? War with the Finns was well written. Not a bad book but could have been so much better."
5,Excellent,"I bought the book based on the other reviews.I really enjoyed the book and would recommend the read to anyone keen on the topic. Rather than rehash what others have already written, why not purchase a copy and enjoy a few evenings engrossed in an accurate account of what it really was like fighting a war in the far north.10/10"
4,good but a little too apologetic,"This is a good read and sounds genuine but there might be a lot of fake memoirs on the subject. The SS men who intended to kill Bolsheviks were to be admired not condemned. Sadly, the best genes in the world were destroyed in those horrors and lesser genes survived to point fingers after the real holocaust which was the immolation of the Waffen SS."
3,Nice thriller to pass the time,"While not perfect, each of the actors carries the film and makes it an enjoyable piece to watch. It is certainly a thriller and has many twists and turns. Some people may read into it ""religiously""- you'll see what I mean when you watch it. Overall a nice entertaining time!"
3,hindsight,"The movie was interesting. Sort of like a""Twilight Zone"" episide. I bought it to see Jeffrey Donovan's performance. He was great as always. Waylon Payne and Leonor Varela were also good,But Miranda Bailey seemed off. It is an interesting thriller and worth a look."
5,Very beautiful,"I do not know if there are better versions of the Ave Verum, but I find this one to be very sweet. Besides, the other pieces the disc contains are magnificent as well."
3,soy sauce,"Purchased this item to try. Had to purchase the case, I believe 3 big bottles. It wasn't what I expected, but now I have 3 big bottles to use. I will share at work and with my family, if I can get them to take some."
4,this album is awesome ya!!!,"unchained melody-it's not the best on this cd,but should respect.8/10anyone of us(stupid mistake)-this is the best song on this cd,i love this song so so much&all; my friends loved it too.10/10sentimental-it had a catchy beat but i don't like it alot.7/10suspicious minds-wow,i hate this song,skip this.....3/103downtown-i just like it for the first time i heard.9/10what my heart wants to say-i love the chorus of the song..8/10good thing-nothing different.8/10too serious too soon-wow,this is my 2nd fave.10/10it ain't obvious-just like ""good thing"".8/10with you all the time-another ballad track&it;'s good.he's good at ballad.9/10(i've got no)self control-another same track....8/10tell me one more time-all i can say is awesome.10/10alive+one&ever; love-7/10walk on by+that's when you know-9/10"
2,disappointing for someone so hyped,"Maybe he comes accross better live but the CD is disappointing.I can only describe it as ""thin"" and life-less."
1,An entire page is missing from this edition,"This is an outstanding book but, unfortunately, the copy I received was defective. The first page of the last chapter (page 395) is missing. Instead, there appears a re-print of page 385. Thus, the pages go: 394, 385, 396, 397 etc. Without the first page of the last chapter, it is quite difficult to discern the author's concluding thoughts.I emailed Random House (the publisher) twice about this but they have never responded."
1,Nightmare inducing film for no ages...,"When I was a small girl of six, I saw the film Fern Gully in the theater and it scared me sh...uh...poopless!! It was an OK flick up until the horrific smog monster appeared, killing all nature and singing about acid rain and sucking all living creatures dry and spitting them out like spinach!!! This movie traumatized me and gave me nightmares for at least a year or two!! This movie is a nightmare ride and if you REALLY want to show your kids a movie with a message about preserving the environment and living in harmony with nature, you'd be better off with Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" than with this film. That is, unless you want your kid to be scared for life..."
5,An exellent film with a strong message,"This is an good film for both children and adults.I first watched this film when I was about 9and I still love it at 15!This film has a strong ecological message which got me interested about saving the rainforests at an early age.I think the cast was brillient, Robin Williams really brings the character ''batty'' to life Samantha Mathis (...) is also good.Overall this is a brillient film and I will keep it for my children and their childrens children."
5,Great Movie,Wonderful family movie. Cute story with great characters and catchy tunes! Big hit with the kids (of all ages)!
5,Ferngully--The Last Rainforest,great movie for all ages. Makes you understand the importanace of saving our world
4,Fern Gully,Great educational piece for teaching elementary students about the destruction of the rain forests and the need to preserve the envirnment.
1,Three-fourths of book,"The first three-fourths of this book is a fairly readable, fairly interesting summarization of previously published accounts of Marian apparitions and research done on near-death experiences. Much of this information can be obtained from the internet and is published here as found on the websites mentioned in the book. However, I was disappointed in the last part of the book--the author basically tells overly detailed family stories that have little ""miraculous"" content. I really don't need a list of every mundane job the author has ever held. The editor would have been wise to cut the book by 1/4 and stick to the documented miracles and the more spectacular of the personal ""miracles"" of others reported secondhand by the author (retold from another book that is cited in this one)."
4,Filter Box not Included,Filter Box is not included as advertised. working with Amazon to correct this issue. Will post again as to the outcome. Good quality item otherwise.
3,"Cheap metal, but cheap cost.",This is made out of pretty cheap pot metal and mine just snapped in half recently. Ordering a new one. Being $12 I can't really complain.
5,very good product,"This is a very good product.I have a son of 4 years and a half.He uses this since 1 year ago.I have noticed that he does not get sick as often as he did, mostly related to stomach problems.He used to have issues, such as if i give him soup for 2 days in a raw and the soup contained tomatoes then he gets problems with the stomach.I was also afraid of allowing him to eat anything that was not prepared in my house.Now he can eat more things than he used to and I feel more relaxed when i decide his meal.It is really great.Also I have notices he does not vomit as often as he did, in the car at long travels.I have also used it for some days when I had stomach problems and got back well very very soon.He uses it daily, i only take a spoon when i feel bad, because it is so expensive in my country. Amazon has a very good price"
4,Most Popular Book of Its Day,"Madison Grant's work is an intriguing summary of racial thought during his day. It was one of the bestsellers. It is, however, not a scientific textbook and should not be treated as such. Dr. Grant, however, was thoroughly knowedgable with a chair in zoology and as the major proponent of ecology in his day as the main force behind establishing Yellowstone. His works, along with others by men like Dr. Lothrop Stoddard heavily influenced future legislation in the 1930s restricting immigration. One reading this book must look at it from the perspective it was written and not by the anti-racist, bigoted perspective we have today."
5,Not racist but reverent today,"Those who wrote the negative reviews, have never read this book and asume it was Hitler bible. I consider myself a libertarian not a white nationalist, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Madison Grant argues throughout the book, that the white race is dieing due to massive multiculturalism. He also argues that race does exist and is not a social construct. Not for the politically correct I should say. I recommend the Bell Curve and many of Lothrop Stoddard stuff as well, and this is my second time purchasing a copy."
4,Terrific book for Marketeers,I have read this book over 20 times. I have purchased 5 copies and given them away to clients. This book is wonderful for helping you create a marketing plan. The cartoons make it easy to read (what is inherently a boring subject) about marketing plans.
3,"good pliers , bad insulated handles","I BOUGHT THIS JOURNEYMAN PLIERS ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO THEY ARE WELL MADE HEAVY DUTY TOOL,A LOT BETTER THAN THE CHEAPER VERSION OF KLINES,THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE INSULATED HANDLES MINE CAME OFF,AND TOOR APART,FOR THE PRICE KLEIN CHARGES THE HANDLES SHOULD LAST A LOT LONGER I DO NOT ABUSE MY TOOLSI NOW USE KNIPEX LINEMANS, MADE IN GERMANY SORRY KLEIN MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT LIKE THE OLD DAYS"
2,"OK, but . . .","I bought the video after seeing the on-stage play. The play was hilarious. The movie less so. This was not vintage Hitchcock, nor was it the satiric farce the play was. Some of the himor was there, but after the play, I was a bit disappointed."
1,More condescending than informative,"This, to me, seemed to be a hasty generalization declaring some falsities against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. While this author may have had certain experiences that led her to her conclusions, she failed to see the big picture. It seemed to me that she was assuming because a few members of the LDS Church acted in one way, that the other 11 million members all around the world were the same. I find it hard to believe that a Church teaching its members to be clean, honest, kind, and trustworthy would have members acting with such behavior.Though I am not a member of the LDS Church myself, I find it unfair to these people who have been known for their genuine happiness. As another reviewer said, this book seems to be more condescending than informative."
1,disappointed,Upon inspection the bladder looked great. However on my second run with the bladder the hose broke away from the male piece and now wont stay attached. This would have been bad enough but it happened in my car and 3 liters of water went everywhere. I would just get a big freezer bag and a straw over this piece of garbage. I guess if its not Lexane Nalgene isnt worth a darn.
5,Well Made & Clever Design,"Was pleasently surprised with this bladder, The handle is agreat idea and makes filling much easier as well as preventing the bag from folding in your pack. No taste at all ever after leaving it over night. The magnet is nice and strong and the on/off function on the bite value is easy to use even with gloves on. The 3L model is pretty big and long and may not fit in to some smaller packs, I have a 40L Marmot pack and have no issues. The only possible fault I could find is the O-ring on the tube at bag joint seems a little hard and and may provoke leaks in the future"
1,JUNK,only buy this if you like to waste money on poor quality garbage! If i could i would only give this a half star.
3,mu computer backpack,"It is a very durable good looking bag, but the description is inaccurate. A laptop 13x11 will not fit in this bag. The shape of the bag tapers at the top. The bottom of the bag measures 11"" but the top of the bag is only 10"". I will be sending it back and will have to ""eat"" the shipping cost!"
1,Cheated,"Amazon sent a wrong item instead of what they display here. The audio CD sent was from the same company, but had a different title and only eight tracks. The tracks aren't lively as in this CD.I initiated a replacement: no help. Wrong stuff came again. I didn't hassle to return it again .. the price was small .. but I will warn you all before ordering."
4,Maple West Elementary - Mr. VanCise's Class -Charlotte's Web,"""Charlotte's Web"", by E.B. White is a great book about friendship. The story has many ways of showing kindness for each other. This is a story of a little girl named Fern, who loved a pig named Wilbur. Wilbur had a dear friend, a spider, named Charlotte. In the story the geese repeat everything. Wilbur's life is at steak. Can his life be saved by Charlotte, or will he be Christmas dinner? We liked this book about friendship. If you like stories about family and friendship, you will LOVE this book!!!!!"
4,A UNIQUE BOND BETWEEN CHARLOTTE AND WILBUR,"A touching story of a friendship between clever and optimistic spider and a naive and cute pig.This story has taught me that a person cannot survive on his own without a trustworthy,loyal and faithful friend on such a dangerous world.I would recommend this book to people young and old."
5,White is great,"Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is about a pig named Wilbur who was a run, but a little girl named Fern wanted to keep him. Charlotte is a spider that lives in Fern's uncle's barn with Wilbur. One day one of the other animals in the barn told Wilbur that when winter came he was going to be butchered, but Charlotte promised Wilbur that she wouldn't let them butcher him. If you want to know what happens, you will have to read the book. I enjoyed reading this book, it described the characters very well and I could see them in my mind. This story is sad, so if you don't like sad stories then I don't recommend that you read this book. If you do like sad stories, then I recommend this book to you."
3,Brandi Singleton's Review,This book is by E.B. Whites.This is a really great book. My favorite character is Wilber which I love pigs. There is a spider named Charlotte. The book is the 50th Anniversary Edition. It's a funny and humorous book. It's very a touching story that tells about a spider that builds a web named SOME PIG! You really should check this book out and hope you enjoy it.
4,Theresa,"In the beginning of the story Fern was in the kitchen talking to her mother.Her mother mentioned that there was a runt out of all the pigs.When Ferns father said he was gonna ""Do away with it"" he meant he was gonna kill it!Fern got really mad at the fact that her father was gonna kill a little weak animal just because he was smaller than the other pigs.Fern went outside and looked at the pig and said ""Can i keep it""?Her mother and her father said ok but we're not responsible for it.Fern said ok!"
5,Charlotte's web,"(...)`'Where's papa going with that ax?'' Wilbur the main character grew up as a runt and a wonderful girl named Fern helps him. Charlotte is a very kind spider, that meets up with Wilbur and becomes friends with Wilbur. Avrey, not the nicest boy, which is Fern's brother is a typical boy and he isn't nice to nature. Templeton, a nasty rat, likes to collect things.Charlotte's Web is about a girl who discovers and saves a pink little pig from being killed. Then Wilbur gets into trouble and Fern's family puts him in the barn. Then Wilbur meets Charlotte. After that other trouble happens to Wilbur. Like Wilbur trying to get loose, and Wilbur trying to save Charlotte. Also when Wilbur is about to get killed in the beginning.I would recommend this book to someone that likes sad stories. Also I would recommend it to people that like adventure. Also maybe to someone who likes happy and powerful stories."
3,Chorlotte's web,The book Charlottes Web is a good book because it's a funny book. My favorite part is when Wilbur faints. My favorite character is Templeton. There are no lessons in this story. It is about a pig and a spider. I will give it three stars. They were going to kill Wilbur.
4,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: It's a children's classic I had never read before.What impressed me: This is a nice, timeless story that easily teaches children about love, death and friendship.What disappointed me: I didn't find the story nearly as emotional as I was led to believe I would. I didn't really enjoy the writing either. It had a tendency to go on and on and on listing synonyms. While that may help the middle grade reader learn new words, it was annoying.Recommended: Yes. I believe this remains a story all children should read while they're young."
5,"""A wonderful book on many levels""",Someone summed it up perfectly as that. I just enjoyedreading this book with my 1rst grade son. The book engagedhim as well as challenged him. A full analysis is needed on all the levels and how....well i'm sure someone did that somewhere in these reviews.
4,I Really Like This Book!,I really like this book because it is really interesting! I really like the illustrations.
5,Childhood favorite! Passing it down to my son.,Classic book and I want to read it to my son. I'm sure he'll appreciate it when he gets older. It was shipped in perfect condition. Thank you!
4,nice story,"I haven't read the book, but my daughter loved it. I bought the book for her. I'm pretty sure it's more detailed than the animation movie, which would make it more interesting. It shows how to do what you can to save a friend you care about."
5,I am very satisfied with my book,"I am very satisfied with my purchase, it was well packed, the product was in a good condition, and arrived safely at my house."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A very good children's story that use the mechanism of talking insects,as well as arachnids, of course, to discuss friendship, life, anddeath, and the roles of things in the world.Perhaps a little sentimental, given the amount of pig saving antics that are found within. People have to eat, after all."
1,These are worthless pieces of junk,"I bought 4 of these. Guess what???? The tops are not interchangeable among the bottoms. God help you if you decide to mix a few drinks and do not keep the right tops associated with the right bottoms. The tops are either too tight (in which case you cannot make them fit) or too loose (in which case they leak when shaking). If you buy one, you are probably OK. But if you buy more than one you will regret it. Right now we have one that we cannot take apart. So that leaves us three. And, of course, another one is too loose (it being the one that was mixed up with the now-stuck-forever one). Total POS's"
5,AN AMAZING BOOK,"This is a phenomenal book. It covers everything one would ever need to know about double bass drumming. Anyone from novice to professional can learn from this book. I started out not knowing anything on double bass, then worked through this book and have become a solid double bass player. Double bass drumming can be used in almost any style especially during fills. BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Great book for all skill levels :),"I really like this book. One, because its mostly excercises and less writting (which is what i was looking for), two, because its easy to understand. Which is good because im not the most skilled drummer really ive only been playing a year now. It really gets your legs practicing. To be honest i havent gotten very far in the book but that is because my legs are so weak i cant seem to do any better then 8th notes for a short time. But thanks to this book my legs are getting stronger and more developed. I really recommend this book for anyone whether you are a begginner or advanced player."
2,"pretty good idea, not so good execution","The idea is good, but the execution is poor. Characters are one dimensional and tend to be sterotypical. There's a bra burning feminist who learns the error of her ways from Anne Boleyn, a racist reinforced by George Silver, and so on. Really can't say enough about the single dimensionality of the characters."
2,BAD GENRE MIX,"When they mixed the supernatural with a crime movie, you sometimes get great results such as ""Crow"" which added the right about of sex, nudity, violence, music, and weird. Sometimes you don't get good results such as this movie. Simon Rex plays Taz, a wannbe-drug king. His dad, or step-dad, is played by the tough guy Ving Rhames, who starts out the movie as dead, comes to life in a flashback, then really comes back to life as a demon. Taz, in order to save his family from being murdered, makes a deal with the devil, (who would BTW already would have his soul) to become the new drug king of Miami. Ving as the demon goes around to eliminate the competition, although as it turns out Taz doesn't have the stomach for the job. Blood, killing, brief sex scenes, brief nudity and not enough of anything worth while. Not a good supernatural film, not a good crime film. The movie has us identify with a drug king who is both a bad guy and a coward. It just doesn't work well."
2,For hardcore Keyes fans only,"Under the Duvet is a collection of essays by Keyes, most of which were previously published in Irish or British newpapers. It does give you a deeper look into the author's life, with chapters about moving back to Ireland, her past drinking problems (the inspiration for Watermelon), what a publicity tour is like, etc. There are also loads of columns about somewhat random things- shoes, soccer, mother's day, religon, and Irishness. Everything is well-written and most are funny, but I think they're more suited to newspaper features than a whole book.Note: I have the Brit edition, so the American edition may be slightly different."
1,"No, I didn't buy Roger Pilon's version . . .","Why can't I buy a simple, nicely bound, pocket sized copy of the Constitution, Declaration of Independence and other important historical US documents WITHOUT a ""preface"" by someone who clearly represents one extreme Tea-talitarian vision that would render all of those documents a nullity?I'm not afraid of all of you Koch-paid drones who post here. And I'm not afraid of the Koch money that finances these supposedly-independent publications. But although I would like to have a pocket-sized paper copy to thumb up, I'm sticking for now to my Kindle/Gutenberg copies on my iPhone, which although less convenient, still fit in my pocket/pack and are not artificially distorted by the American rightist and anti-democratic agenda."
3,"Not really a ""pocket"" size","Product came promptly and was in mint condition. However, I thought it was described as ""pocket"" sized, when it is actually closer to the size of a small notebook. Purchased as a gift for my best friend who recently graduated law school - she thought it was hilarious."
5,Very Handy,"A very nice size for the American who would like to learn more of what their country was Founded on. Very durable cover, pages are good quality. I expect to have this item for quite a while. Excellent for memorization. Every True Patriot needs to brush up on the Constitution these days..."
5,Every American should own this,"Perfect little reprint of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Pocket/purse/briefcase size. Great price. Have this in your home, every American should."
4,US Constitution,I am going back to school to become a paralegal and I thought I should buy a copy of the US Constitution for my future use. This book is great. It lets you know what parts of the original document have been amended and when; all of the amendments are in the book. It also has the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation which is an added bonus.
3,It's huge,"I found this while browsing pocket Constitutions and *thought* that was what I was buying. If you look at the item details it does give the size, but I didn't notice when I ordered as I thought a pocket Constitution would be appropriately sized. This is more like a ""your gramma's purse"" Constitution."
5,great idea!,"I got these boards because I was setting up a kitchen and knew I wanted multiple boards, but didn't want thick ones. These boards are great.-The colors are helpful for distinguishing between the different uses. I can pull out the red one any time I deal with meat, then toss it into the dishwasher and move on to vegetables without worrying about transfer of bacteria.-The silicone is a nice material for the kitchen, and the thin boards are flexible enough to facilitate dumping chopped food into pans.-The non-slip bottoms are a great idea--who wants to use a knife on a shifting surface. They are also well-executed in that they really don't seem to slip.-I've used mine as trivets of a sort--they seem to take heat well while protecting my table or countertops."
4,"Do not be fooled by the brand name, their not Silicone!","I also assumed these were Silicone, which they are not. They are still a nice product and I have purchased several more for Chistmas gifts. Like another review mentioned, they are best used placed over your wood cutting board. They also save time when you need to cut different things and have 4 different boards available."
5,These guys are the gem of the kitchen,These are now my favorite cutting boards. You can separate the various things you want to cut and they clean up quickly in the sink or dishwasher. They lie flat so you can use them on any surface and the surface is protected.Thumbs up for these.
1,Very Disappointing,"Because this book was paired with the book Pompeii, I was expecting a book full of great images. It was not! It is virtually the same book published by Harper & Row in 1966. All the pictures are black and white and about the same quality as Amedeo Maiuri's who can be forgiven as his guide to Herculaneum was published in 1962. Having read Maiuri's book, I found Deiss's descriptions very similar. A very disappointing purchase!"
2,"Interesting, but I simply don't agree with her",I have been studying astrology for 16 years or so. This book was certainly something I was not supposed to ignore. But some of the things she mentions were quite questionable.I understand the fact that the roles of mothers and fathers in the modern society have been changing. But that does not simply mean the changes of what 4th house and 10th house represent in natal charts.
5,Liz Greene's Best,"Liz Greene serves as an insightful, sympathetic guide through this intensive tour of the various manifestations of Saturn. As a tool for self discovery, or as a source of detailed information to assist in work with others, this book is invaluable. Read it slowly, read it several times, use it as a reference."
2,Don't watch,This movie is gross and boring. I never cared less about a main character. My favorite actor in this movie was the bicycle. Offensive pornography references over and over.
4,jol,I have loved Babe Ruth since the 70's and Wells Fargo is a timeless piece of music that sounds as good today as it did 32 years ago!
3,Really good but....,"...the only complaint I have is not knowing this is part 2 and 3 of a trilogy before reading it. (Revenge of the Sinister 6 & Secret of the Sinister 6) It doesn't specify anywhere on the front, back or inside cover (at least not my copy) that this is the middle and finale of a trilogy. That is the only reason for the average rating I gave it. W/ the title of The Sinister 6 Combo, I was under the impression that these were 2 unrelated stories featuring the 6.Other then that, yes it is a very good book for Spidey fans and comic fans in general. The story is well laid out and the action sequences are very much a page turner.For anyone interested in this book, do yourself a favor and start w/ the first of this trilogy series Gathering of the Sinister 6 before plunging into this one."
5,Love home made yogurt,"This is a product that is fool proof. Both the brand name starter as well as store bought container yogurt starters work well. I am still in the experimental stage and the process is so easy. The unit keeps the culture at the right temperature and so far all the batches have turned out well.The only reservation I have is when taking the jar out.... be very careful. The lid loosens because of the pressure and the only way to grab the jar is by grasping the sides with your fingers otherwise... major spill (yes, it happened to me). I highly recommend this unit because of the ease and maintenance free operation"
1,NO GOOD FOR 24 HR. YOGURT OR SCD DIET. GETS TOO HOT!!,"I bought this because the SCD Diet recommended this brand. However, it gets too hot when you ferment the yogurt for 24 hours. My yogurt was 120 degrees and that's killing beneficial bacteria. The yogurt should be between 100 - 110 degrees at the most. Had I known this ahead of time I would have never bought it.It might be okay for 4 hr fermented yogurt but save your money if you are looking at this based on a SCD diet recommendation."
5,MUY BUENO,"Esta nota es para las personas de habla español.Yo compre este equipo porque me gusta mucho el yogourt, el sistema es insuperable, es muy sencillo, yo lo dejo mas del tiempo que dicen las instrucciones, aunque te dice para mas consistencia dejarlo mas tiempo, yo lo dejo aproximadamente de 12 a 14 horas en la maquina.No se asusten si la tapa de dentro donde va la leche con la la bacteria se destapa eso sucede despues de muchas horas lo que yo hago es sacarlo nuevamente cerrarlo nuevamente y volverlo a poner tambien se puede levantar la tapa de afuera cuando se abre la de dentro y se vuelve a tapar.cuando eso sucede se siente un ruido cuando se aprende a conocer el ruido no te asustas mas.lo que yo hago siempre lo pongo con la cantidad de agua que indican las intrucciones para seguir bien ese paso.tiene un acido excelente el yogourt y la calidad es deliciosa.que lo disfruten los que lo compren."
2,Worked well until water got into electronics area,"I have been using this product weekly since early summer and it has worked well. Unfortunately the last time I used it I noticed water had become trapped in the lower cavity where the wiring and heating element is located. I thought maybe I had over-filled it last time I had used it so took it apart and made sure everything was completely dry. I made another batch of yogurt and was very careful not to fill the water above the lower mark. When the yogurt was finished, water was once again in the heating element compartment. I am not comfortable using it anymore but now the warranty period is passed."
5,Great Product,I've owned one of these products for years and use it all the time. I use a few spoons of store bought yogurt or some from the previous batch as the starter and it makes great yogurt. Near foolproof. I have also made cheese with it. I just purchased another one for a gift--the only change is the inside container is no longer made of glass.
1,obscene pricing and shipping weight,"What kind of a joke is this, $357.87 for a yoghurt maker! And the shipping weight is 256 pounds considering that the weight of the machine is a MERE 16 pounds??? Who in their right mind would even think once about buying something like that!"
1,"This Isn't A Yogurt Maker, It's A Cheese Maker !!!",This is over-priced and the heat is too high. My wife has made yogurt for decades and thinks this Yogourmet2 quart yogurt maker is rediculous. She went back to a simple tried and true fool proof method of putting the starter in a small insulated cooler with a couple of heated rice bags and it makes the tastiest yogurt ever.So There. Gotta get our money back.
2,overpriced,"Does what it says, materials are of nice quality, but nothing more than a just a warmth keeper. Doesn`t have a timer, or temperature indicator, and we cannot really make nice smooth yogurt with it, what came out was a kind of really powdery texture. I wouldn`t pay $ 50 dollars for it. Maybe $30 is a resonable price."
5,Nobel Prize Winner,"""Israeli economist Yisrael (Robert J.) Aumann said Monday he was elated after learning in a phone call from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that he and a fellow scientist had won the 2005 <http://nobelprize.org/> Nobel prize in economics for their game theory analysis.Aumann, 75, of the Hebrew University and American Thomas C. Schelling, 84, of the University of Maryland were awarded the prize for their work on game theories that help explain economic conflicts, including trade and price wars.""Nuff said."
4,Back to Basics SJR1X Smoothie Blast,Chops ice good. Does a good job making Smoothie's. A bitnoisy. Good price / value.
4,It's interesting,"Since I don't possess an MC, this looked like a terrible waste of time, but even in the most trivial of doings, there's an entire philosophy behind. The book deals with crucial elements of the development of Western philosophy. If Western mentality today lacks desirable elements, it's extremely difficult to tell when or where or who chose a less favorable path. Mr. Pirsig suggests that the error can be traced back to the Greeks. This conclusion itself seems to relie on a misconception, because it's unlikely that there's anything like an ideel philosophy. Anyway, the book dares to adress such complex questions and gets away with it. That's an effort in itself worth 4 stars, I think. The story consists of a past and a present situation. Personally, I find the past far more interesting than the present. I admit that the story would suffer much if the present was erased, still, focus could have been even more on the past situation."
5,How to win by losing.,Winning is more than beating the other person. Often we win by `losing' if that results in Quality. What is seen as losing by others often brings us more than if we'd been selfish and demanded the whole pie for ourselves. This is a `light-bulb' flashing book if you're looking to open up yourself to being the very best you can possibly be.
2,Overrated,"In maintaining an active interest in philosophy I was quite eager to tackle this somewhat enigmatic work. This title is one of thos that you oft hear mentioned and rarely discussed. What I encoutnered was a pseudo-biographical work that presents it's ideas and concepts slowly, poorly and seemingly as condescendingly as possible. I would only advise those well versed in classical greek philosophy to even consider this text. The areas of the text pertaining to Zen Buddhism are very welcome and far to short ... even if the points made are rudimentary and well known today."
2,A touchstone for irrationalism,"I noticed long ago that people who tend toward irrationalism usually cite Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as their favorite book or ""Bible.""Pirsig seems to have insight-fully taken note of some unsatisfactory outcomes of philosophy, but instead of identifying the problem and fixing it, he embraces the very sloppy reasoning that precipitated the errors he bemoans.Two stars because it is slightly more interesting than Heidegger, but isn't anywhere near to being in the same league as Wittgenstein."
5,amazing book,"this book is great, the writer truely has an interesting perspective on the world. it is truely original, and makes you look at things in new ways.its great, i recoment you BUY IT!"
2,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"", by Robert Prisig just didn't click with me. After I completed the book I checked Amazon.com and browsed through some of the recent reviews. Many of the reviews were favorable. Some even hinted that the book was life changing. Personally I felt the book was extremely boring and at times I even found myself thinking, what the.... Well you know the rest. It wasn't until about three-quarters of the way through the book that I found anything interesting or meaningful in the story. For those of you who found meaning in Mr. Pirsig's book I appauld you. If not may I suggest another book with a simmiliar title called Zen and the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel."
4,A little out of date--but a great re-read for me.,"I really wonder how much acceptence and detatchment can responsibly be accepted by a thinking humanitarian in this day and age. There is a luxury and an innocence in such thinking that many of us can no longer afford.I'm desperate for more real meat and less ideology.Though not as well written and perhaps too robust for many readers--a more forward looking vision can be found in FitzGeralds manual for life ""Sea-Steading"""
